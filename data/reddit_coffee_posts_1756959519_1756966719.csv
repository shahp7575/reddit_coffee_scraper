The scene goes like this. There’s this older guy (either in his late 50s or early 60s) with a mustache and he’s wearing like a Hawaiian shirt. He kills the receptionist of the police station and then he pretends to be the receptionist when this fat cop shows up. He lowers the fat cops guard and then he shoots him to, fat cop falls into a coffee table dead. Then he makes his way to back of the police station hunting down this black girl cop. He shoots at her with like an uzi but doesn’t kill her. Eventually he runs out bullets and had to reload so the girl cop takes a chance and runs into the room with the holding cell. She closes the door before the old assassin can get her and since the doors made out of some strong metal, the assassin can’t shoot through the door. There’s a guy in the holding cell and he knows the assassin. Him and the assassin get into some witty banter through the metal door as the cop is in the corner. And that’s where the scene ends. The only other information I can give is the film is either from the 2010s or 2020s and the old assassin might’ve had a southern accent. ",1,1756966656.0,tipofmytongue,1,1.0,False

I will be staying in Abu Dhabi next week (from Tuesday to Friday). My friends have come with me, but they would be in Dubai for most of these days because of work commitments (while my office is in Abu Dhabi), so I gotta stay here.

I am looking for people in the age bracket of around 23 to 33 years old, who would be open to exploring the major tourist attractions (trips to places like Louvre Abu Dhabi, Qasr Al Watan, or Yas theme parks) with me in Abu Dhabi. I’m excited to meet new people and explore this beautiful city together. I’m looking for friends to grab coffee, try local and underrated food spots, check out local street markets, and discover hidden gems around Abu Dhabi.

If you’re up for a friendly chat or planning a small meetup, drop a comment or DM. Thanks in advance and looking forward to meeting some cool people in Abu Dhabi!",1,1756966412.0,UAE,0,1.0,False
1n82h7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1n82h7u/today_is_my_one_year_anniversary_of_being/,Today is my one year anniversary of being caffeine free,"Hi everyone, 

I made it to one year of being caffeine free! No coffee, caffeine, energy drinks, yerbe matte, chocolate, or anything else. Here are some take aways: 

1. After quitting caffeine, l felt no motivation or energy for 2 months and low energy / motivation till the 6th month mark. While this sucked it didn’t last forever. Now I wake up ready to tackle the day. 

2. I gained weight after quitting - about 10 pounds. It’s since then mostly come off. 

3. Quitting added and processed sugars was an absolute necessity for me. The crashes I’d have with sugar and no caffeine had me sleeping all day long. 

4. Quitting caffeine did NOT solve my GI problems. While I definitely have more regular bowel movements, I still get very bloated. However, quitting caffeine helped me rule out caffeine as a cause, which was worth it.

1n82gm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hatemyjob/comments/1n82gm1/i_dont_know_what_to_do_my_manager_treats_me_like/,"I don’t know what to do, my manager treats me like garbage compared to everyone else.","I haven’t been sleeping the past couple nights due to this and it finally reaching a point where I’ve realized it’s ruining my mental health. 

For context, I’m 25F, this is not my “career” job, it’s merely a college part time job that I stayed at after I graduated due to full time hours coming up and needing money. And my friends and family brush off my situation as “well, who cares, you won’t be there for long” 

But the thing is, I’m not getting hired. As you all probably know, the job market sucks and I’ve had rejection after rejection. So right now I’m stuck here until I can get out. It’s a minimum wage job in customer service, in an office. 

The problem lies with my manager. 

He’s older than me, probably late thirties. Hasn’t liked me since I started. In fact, on my first day he didn’t say hello and colleagues all introduced themselves except him. Would storm past me constantly through the day as if I was invisible. 

People have had issues with him, but he doesn’t consistently treat anyone as awful as me. And it’s confusing everyone - people have told me that behind my back, other colleagues have said “he’s so awful to (my name), why is that?” So I know it’s not in my head. 

- never greets me, says hello, asks about me, if another colleague is standing next to me he will light up and joke around with them, be friendly. 

- will just blatantly ignore me if I ask a question. I was walking past his desk once and he was making posters. I asked what they were for. No response. I just walked away. 

- One time I made a mistake, when I was fairly new. Nothing major. He stormed through to me from his office and said “what the fuck is wrong with you?” At this point no one else was around. When I tried to explain, he would just shake his head and scoff at me. Some new colleagues have starred in my role and I noticed one of them made the same mistake in her first week and he laughed and said it happens to everyone. 

- The way he speaks to me, when he does, is always disgust. Scoffing. Confused. Patronizing. He never talks to me personally, only if I’ve done something wrong or to ask me about something he suspects I’ve done wrong. As I’m talking, he’ll make the same face and talk in the same attitude. 

- When I speak in his presence, he will look at other colleagues and not me, make faces, shake his head. Almost as if to say “what is she talking about” in like a high school bully way. 

- One time I couldn’t find something that I really needed. I asked him for help as he was walking past, and he told me to check a specific place. I said I had. He came back minutes later while I was on a call with someone doing my work and threw said item onto my lap. It was heavy so it actually hurt. It was aggressive and he stormed off aged. This was his way of saying “I found it, look harder”. 

- he constantly checks everything I do, to the point where he will come up to my work all throughout the day and pick it up to check I’m doing it correctly. And try and find things to point out. One of my colleagues even said while I was on my lunch that he came up and rummaged through things I’d printed to look for errors and was holding his breath, waiting to find something. He does not do this with anyone else. Hell then pounce on me and constantly berate me for any little tiny thing he notices is wrong. 

- We have a chart where it tracks our customer satisfaction and survey points per person and I am the second top out of over 15 colleagues all doing the same thing. I am high performing and never get praised for this. I’m not a bad worker. 

- One time it was me and two other colleagues chatting around my desk. He came up and started talking about coffee and discussing with them how he was craving it. I was half listening half on my computer as it was my desk, but I kept trying to join in the conversation and the only people relying to me were my other co workers. His eye contact stayed with them and didn’t look at me once. He then offered them a coffee, one after the other, and walked off without asking me. One of my co workers was new and was so offended that she asked if I wanted hers. I said no, this happens. 

- we have another supervisor who is second to his role and I’ve spoken to him about this multiple times. He doesn’t deny it happens but doesn’t ever admit it does either. Instead he will tell me “oh he’s nasty to me too, he constantly will tell me to do more of this” and talks about his experience and says the manager is just that kind of person. But everyone knows it’s more about his behavior around me and the way he treats me and it’s different than how he treats everyone else. 

- for me it’s mostly lack of respect. I don’t care if he doesn’t like me but he doesn’t treat me with respect. He also will, in front of me, praise other colleagues and tell them they are star co workers and he’s afraid of losing them. While I’m standing there and has never said anything like this to me despite me performing better. 

I just don’t feel appreciated. My co workers are all different ages. Some are older and some are 20,21. Some have also graduated like me and are actively looking for roles in their field like myself. 
In fact, one who recently left got a present from him for getting in with a top company and he gave her great references. So I know it’s not the fact I am younger, older or whatever. 

The younger ones are pretty women who he flirts with and seems to get on with. It also makes me insecure because, and not that I want him to find me attractive because he repulses me, but it’s made me question how I look. I know I’m an attractive woman, I have a boyfriend and yet it feels in the office like I’m a dumpy, awkward strange person due to the way he acts like I’m invisible or the most stupid employee he’s hired. When I’m not. Everyone else gets on with me, laughs with me, the guys joke around. It’s just him. 

I honestly have no idea what to do anymore and yes I am hoping to leave soon but even until then I don’t think I can go in. It’s making me feel sick every time I have a shift. Does anyone have any advice? ",1,1756966343.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

1n82g1w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n82g1w,2025 SF Pen Show Recap & Haul,"I finally feel like I've recovered from the whirlwind that is the SF Pen Show. I've been to a couple of pen shows before, but this was my first time attending SF and wow, it's on a whole different level. The large crowds, the high energy, the wide variety of vendors, and meeting so many friendly people made for a really unforgettable experience.

Listing the pens above, from left to right: Faber-Castell Hexo, White Bear Pens Echo, Stüdyo Ağaçkakan Pera, Karas Kustoms Decograph, Pilot E95, Schon DSGN Pocket Six.

The inks, from left to right: Diamine Sargasso Sea (received during the Pen & Stationery Meetup/Destash), Kiwi Inks Haunted Forest, KWZ It Smells Like Coffee (and it really does!), Amarillo Stationery Teal Waistband, and Colorverse King's Road.

Too many things to list in the stationery haul, but please let me know if there's anything specific you want to know more about.

I also wrote a quick recap about Friday, which you can [check out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1n3ojys/some_quick_notes_after_my_first_day_at_the_sf_pen/) if you're interested.

**Weekend Recap:**

Saturday was by far the craziest day of the show. I had an all access pass, so I came to the venue around 20 minutes after doors opened. I walked straight in, no line. There didn't seem to be a wild rush like Friday morning, and the crowds felt smaller. I think most people who were after exclusives or limited items had already accomplished their goals the day before. And yet, it still felt like the calm before a storm. I took advantage of the lull and visited some vendors that I had missed on Friday. Once general admission opened at 10am, the show floor started getting a lot busier, and by 11, the crowds had swelled substantially. If you're claustrophobic, Saturday is not the day to come to the pen show. It's even worse when a vendor is doing a giveaway, as the people gathering for the raffle end up clogging all of the foot traffic in that area. If you're not participating in a giveaway, it's best to avoid those tables when they happen. Despite the crowds, I still had a really fun time talking to vendors and chatting with other attendees. One thing that caught me by surprise: Blick Art had a table tucked away in the back of nibmeister alley, and they were selling several inks at a discount, including 20% off Colorverse inks. They had a pretty good selection too but seemed to be running low on stock by the time I found them Saturday afternoon. Still, I managed to walk away with a bottle of King's Road for about 12 bucks. I usually associate Blick Art with traditional art supplies. I had no idea they sold fountain pens and inks!

Sunday was a lot more mellow. Still plenty of people, but it felt calmer and easier to navigate the show floor. Some vendors had already sold out of their stock by the end of Saturday, so a few tables were empty that morning. Others had very little left. I think one of the glass pen vendors literally had a single pen left for sale, which was quickly snatched up. Other vendors packed up early, such as Esterbrook, who was gone by 2pm. The ink testing station in the middle of the foyer wasn't that crowded on Sunday, so I finally got the chance to check out some of the inks on hand. After scanning the QR code, I couldn't figure out why the numbers on the pens didn't seem to match the inks. I spoke out loud about my confusion, and a very kind lady pointed out that the spreadsheet had corresponding tabs for each tray of pens. I was staring at the wrong list of inks! Later on, the same lady refilled the empty pen that was supposed to contain the 2025 show exclusive ink, Colorverse San Francisco Fog, using her own bottle. She was seriously one of the nicest people I encountered at the show. If you're on Reddit and happen to see this, thank you again!

One big regret I had about the entire show was waiting too long before trying to sign up for the seminars and events that I was interested in. I missed out on the Traveler's Company event, the Hobonichi preview, and the Inks seminar. They were free to attend, quickly ran out of reservations, and hit max attendance. If I can make it to SF again next year, I would sign up as soon as the event schedule dropped. Also, some events, like the Hobonichi preview, apparently allowed walk-ins if there was enough space. I didn't know that, so I missed two chances to attend the preview LOL. If you're planning to go to any events/seminars next year, learn from my mistakes! Sign up early!

Many fun things happened during the pen show, but I wanted to highlight a few of my favorite personal moments:

* I stopped by Toyooka Craft first thing Friday morning to get a waitlist number. I believe I was number 49? I came back about two hours later when they were on number 47. This table, along with Pinky Elephant, seemed to be the most busy all day. While waiting in line to buy a pen box, I had the honor of talking to Yamazaki-san, who at 85 years old, continued to help out with sales. When I told him how beautiful the boxes were, he lit up and immediately began pointing out the different kinds of wood they used for each type of box. I could tell just how much passion he continues to have for his craft, which made me really appreciate the work and care that went into each piece.
* Visited White Bear Pens and had a lovely conversation with Mikayla, who took the time to explain her pen-making process and patiently answered all of my questions. I could barely contain my excitement. I was probably babbling a lot, but she was very kind LOL. I've had the Echo on my wish list for almost a year now, and to finally meet Mikayla and purchase one of her pens was such an awesome moment.
* Spotted Odin, the SF Pen Show official mascot! He looks a lot bigger in person but seemed to have a very sweet and mellow personality. I wanted to give him a few head scratches. However, he was very popular, so I opted to admire him from afar.
* Got to nerd out about journaling with Christine at Everyday Explorers. I discovered her stamps during a recent trip to M. Lovewell. I couldn't resist picking up a few new ones at the show. I'm a rookie when it comes to the stamping world, but I'm so excited to start giving my journal entries a little more visual appeal.
* While waiting in line at the Traveler's Company table, I saw a box of their washi tapes and exclaimed, ""Oh no, not the washi tapes! I don't need anymore!"" and to have three other people around me all sigh and agree was just too funny. 😆
* Visited the Schon DSGN table and got to meet Ian Schon, who spoke about all the hard work that went into creating the Monoc Evo. He said he hadn't slept much prepping for SF, but I could tell how excited he was when he presented one of the Monoc Evos and showed off its features. I bought a Pocket Six and told him how I had admired his pens for months but didn't want to buy one until I could test it in person. To my surprise, he said ""good call"" and encouraged me to always try out new pens whenever possible. As I was about to leave, he asked me for my name and formally introduced himself, even though I already knew who he was LOL. Ian is so cool, truly a gentleman and a scholar.
* I met one of the pen makers for Karas Kustoms, ""Gee Money"" (that was on her name tag!) who had been learning to pour resin for their Decograph pens. A lot of these designs weren't on their website and were only being sold at the show. They had some really beautiful pens, and I hope Gee Money gets the opportunity to continue experimenting, learning, and making more resin Decograph pens. I ended up getting the Orange Marmalade one. I even bought a bottle of KWZ It Smells Like Coffee to pair with it. Has anyone else ever done a breakfast themed pen and ink combo before? 😆

Overall, I had a lot of fun. Yes, the crowds were crazy at times, but for me, it was well worth enduring for this unique experience. I got to write with pens that I've only seen online and even handle a few that were way out of my price range. I tested a bunch of inks without having to buy samples or bottles. And the best part, for me at least, was hanging out with so many amazing people, vendors and attendees alike. I'm an introvert at heart, but I enjoyed talking pens with people from all over the US and from all over the world, too. The fountain pen community never ceases to amaze me. It was an exhausting three days, but like I said, it was great fun and an awesome experience. I hope I can attend again next year!",3,1756966285.0,fountainpens,0,1.0,False

Right now I make espresso lungo - 23g in and 69g out in 30s which results in a nice coffee when the machine is playing nice.  Do one too many too quickly and the shot timing will be all out of whack.

1n82apf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n82apf/i_just_went_through_the_messiest_break_up_ever/,"I just went through the messiest break up ever, and now I’m friends with someone I might have feelings for?","I just went through the messiest break up. And now I’m friends with someone I may have liked again?

I’m (21m) going to try to explain this the best I can. I’m going through a lot of emotions right now and I just need to scream into the void. 

I, last year met this girl, we’ll call Raven (21F) and we became really good friends. Like she was one of my number ones pretty fast. And we kinda had a weird little situation going on? We never had sex, she’s asexual and I dont care about sex. So out hangouts evolved into weird little gap sessions I’d look forward too, late night food runs at 2am, and one time we even took a couples quiz together. There was one night she even opened up to me about ultra personal things she said she’s never told anyone, and she just laid on me talking. I don’t wanna say I caught feelings because honestly? I didn’t think she was interested because she straight up said she wasn’t. So I never perused her, we stayed friends. At one point she made a joke about me pretending to be her boyfriend so she could get a hysterectomy. Since in my state you basically have to have male approval for it. I laughed and she laughed and we jokes about it a couple times but that’s as far as that went.

Now around this time she actually starts talking to one of my buddies, and she’s talking. About him but still hanging out with me, but she pulls back on almost everything so I just kinda go “fuck it” and around this time i became friends with Millie (20F)

Me and Millie start flirting lowkey and Raven knows, and she pulls away even more to where she’s barely talking to me in class, we stop hanging out, and she’s talking just kinda moves on.

Around this time i became really unwell, idk what was going on but my paranoia was through the roof and I think i had a manic episode. During this one of me and Ravens mutual friends texts me saying “Raven has been talking mad shit about you” 

I snap, that sent me over the edge. I became super distrustful of everyone, and I made the mistake of blocking Raven and that friend everywhere. And not to long after that me and Millie start dating.

When me and Millie started dating I noticed Raven became a lot softer. She’s a very tough woman, im talking like her black hair, like 26 tattoos, has a very “no shit” kind of personality. But she’s softer, she didn’t really look at me anymore, she stopped talking to me completely. And at the time that’s what I wanted, I thought I was happy.

The relationship with Millie was 7 months long. And that was probably the worst 7 months of my life. Slowly she made me cut off my friends, she talked shit about me and hung out with her ex while dating me and I didn’t even know until after we broke up. She was pushing for marriage after 2 months. She faked a miscarriage to keep me around. I don’t know why I stayed, maybe I was sick and she was giving me attention, maybe I gaslit myself into believing everything was OK. But at the end of summer I broke up with her and all hell went loose. 

She was making post on TikTok and Instagram about “shitty ex-boyfriend’s”, threatened to show up at my house, holding my stuff, ransom, texting my family and what little friends I had at the time demanding that they give her access to me, and even accuse me of cheating on her. So I wasn’t doing hot. 

Me and Raven’s mutual friend ended up reaching out to check on me. And he apologized for everything, he listed off everything that he did wrong and how bad he felt doing that to me.  I asked why he told me anything and he said he didn’t know, but he wanted to change and so far he’s proving he is changing.

Now to Raven. I tried adding her back on Snapchat once while I was still with Millie, and she shot me down real quick. Which I don’t blame her for. I did genuinely miss being her friend, I miss hanging out with her, I miss being around her. And it felt like that was gone.

But when this college semester started, I noticed she was actively going out of her way to talk to me. She was joking around with me in a way she hadn’t in months. Talking to me like absolutely nothing happened. But every once in a while, she would snap back to how she was acting for like a day, but then the next day immediately go back to acting like nothing was wrong.

Tonight I saw her and we sat down and genuinely talked for the first time in a while. I’ll do my best to give a play-by-play of the entire interaction.

I walk into the classroom where she is and she points at me and goes  “OP! How dare you not bring me a monster?” Referring to the fact that I brought a monster for myself. I made a joke about “don’t worry I’ll get you next time.” And she said “yeah you better, your life depends on it” and then she started full belly laughing. So like a minute later, I went out to the vending machine and bought her a monster. I don’t really know why I did, but I wanted to I guess.

I came back in and gave it to her, and I saw her face light up in a way I hadn’t seen in awhile. She looked at me and said “holy shit you’re the best” and then she balled up her hands and motion them towards me. I’m not totally sure what she’s trying to do, but she shakes them at me so I hold them because I don’t know what else to do.

“ my life is forever in your debt, which honestly is kind of scary” she said and we both laughed. 

Then out of nowhere, she asked how I was doing after the break up. News of the break up spread really fast since I live in a small college town and everyone kinda knows each other. I’ve gone through and I have apologized to pretty much all of my friends and I’m lucky that they’ve all been receptive. Everyone down here is on my side and aren’t listening to a word Millie is saying. So I give her some of the spark notes and she is sitting there with her mouth wide open in shock. 

She mentioned that she had a weird situation over the summer that ended really messy too, so she understood. We kept talking and joking like everything was normal and then out of nowhere. I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee sometime to talk about everything because I had some things I wanted to say to her.

She smiled really big and said “yeah I’d love that. I have some things I wanna say to you too. “ in this soft voice she never uses. She never uses some other people join us and now we’re all talking and joking around in a group.

At the end of the rehearsal, I get down from my seat and I start to fall, I end up catching myself before I could fall, but she ran directly to my side with her arms out.

R- “ dammit OP, I was supposed to catch you”

M-oh if I was going to fall, I think I’d try to aim for someone else, I ain’t gonna do that to you 

R- “NO dude, you’re supposed to be my damsel in distress, and I’m here to rescue you” 

We both laugh again and then after that, we parted ways. While my friend was driving me home, I got the urge to try adding her on Snapchat again. And she accepted within like 30 seconds.


Now do I like her? I don’t really know. I’m not in the headspace to put up with another relationship right now, especially with how badly this last one ended. All I want from her is to be her friend again. Tonight we kind of acknowledged some things, but we’ll be planning a coffee hang out soon to talk about it in depth. I’m kind of nervous about seeing her, when she had me hold her hands tonight I’ll be honest, I found my heart flutter just a tiny bit. But I don’t want a relationship, and I don’t think she does either. I don’t think I’m really coming here for advice, just to scream into the void about what the hell the past year has been. I’ve made a shit ton of mistakes and I’m doing everything I can to make up for them. I’m so incredibly lucky that I didn’t lose every single one of my friends and that Raven even wants to give me a chance to be her friend again.

I feel like shit, but I know everything is going to be OK. I’m doing everything in my power to make it right. And tonight was a really good sign. 

Thank you so much.

[breville kettle](https://s.shopee.ph/9zo3rVOBdI): well made wattage plays at 2200 watts below, quiet, metalic exterior but the clear places are plastic, no splash, handle isnt hot but really really expensive, reaches boiling point sometimes shakes. well made as the cats have made this thing fall down a few times.

[Micromatic](https://s.shopee.ph/40WqhPtx6f): for the below 500, this thing is a beauty, had 3, still functioning, metallic exterior, does get water marks when used, didnt expect something this cheap to be quality in stainless, better than the [Kyowa](https://s.shopee.ph/2qKsmvbJml), temp does reach on time, plays around at 1210 watts, and heats up a bit slow at 5 minutes 15 seconds to 6 minutes lets, mostly at 5 minute above mark, so using meralco calculator it is costing at 1.64 cents per use. so far its ok, we have this in a few properties of the boss. does the job.

[Brewista](https://s.shopee.ph/6VEBgLSjxI): dang this thing is expensive but fast, super quiet wattage plays at 1162 to 1200, 3 minutes 10 seconds average, lowest speed was 3 minutes 7 seconds that means its 84 cents per use, great if you like having green tea, expensive though. would i recommend this yes if you like having certain coffees and certain teas. well made. 0.6 only.

[bonavita](https://s.lazada.com.ph/s.uYQuJ?cc): another expensive, more mech than digital, slower than brewista, takes 5 minutes, the settings must be palced on boiling setting not on the temp gaugage unlike brewista, all metallic but its larger at 1.2l, wattage is quite high at 2200 playing on that, using meralco meter that reaches 3 pesos mas o minus, well built. handle doesnt get hot

[Sapoe](https://s.shopee.ph/VtzZAX2Ke): Wattage a bit high, tested it more and dang it reaches 2400 watts. may look expensive but uses mostly plastic, it isnt clear glass but clear plastic, does the job well, need to press button in middle to open as opposed to side. side is for heating up, gf got confused there. actually good item as far as durability is. but few other problems, using the calculator this thing might not be worth to purchase even durability is excellent. took 6 minutes 30 seconds, average actually reaches 6 minutes then you factor in 2400 watts, would not recommend this.

[Russell Hobbes](https://s.shopee.ph/4L6i7vQ7vt): got to say excellent here, quite sturdy, gets up in temp properly, not noisy, glass is quite sturdy can handle changes in temp without cracking. ive done a lot with this model, making gulab tea, heck i even cooked tea with the device itself. the temp is very good in getting there. now few problems wattage a bit high 2200 to 2300 but it took only 4 minutes average so 2 pesos 60 cents using it, not bad actually not like [Sapoe](https://s.shopee.ph/VtzZAX2Ke), my God 6 minutes, i never knew it took long with that till i did this experiment.

[Xiaomi Mijia Electric Kettle](https://s.shopee.ph/50PO7VKZAP), good kettle, not that expensive, 6 minute 45 to 7 after numerous tries, its double walled it isnt bad to say, the handle doesnt get hot when being used unlike some cheaper models or expensive ones in the list. durable, good use, gf likes it due to sleek look. using meralco appliance calculator per use it would be 2.8 pesos. not that bad. not great. affiliate link posted take note this is at full.

1n825g9,https://i.redd.it/f7tlhqel73nf1.jpeg,Leo rewrite,"Leo rewrite:

Guys, I have made a rewritten version of leo. Here's my version:-

So, the movie begins with Parthiban entering his coffee shop and doing his job (no hyena scene). Then, the first half is pretty much the same as leo. Everything goes well until the myskkin and his gang enter inside the coffee shop, cause chaos and Parthiban takes a gun, kills them, goes to court and there he is released and people see him as a hero and his image comes in the papers. Till this, it is same as leo movie. But then comes a twist

During night time of let's say 1 o clock, 2 jeeps come and henchmen get out of the jeep and their boss gets out of the jeep. And that boss is - Leo (that's right Leo). He and his henchmen attack a drug shop, raid them and kill the shopkeepers. Then they all sit down and discuss about random things and one of the henchman shows the Parthiban news article to Leo. Leo seems surprised at first but then he says 'doesn't matter' and moves on.

Then, it goes to a person called Antony das, who is a big drug mafia kingpin (no harold das here). So his business is getting affected by Leo's daily activities and he wants to kill leo. He searched for leo everywhere and he doesn't get him. But, one of his henchmen show him the Parthiban news article. Then he suspects that Parthiban is Leo and goes in search for him. The interval.

So second half is basically about Parthiban and leo confusion within the characters. Many people ask Parthiban whether he is Leo or not and Parthiban never accepts it. There are some lcu references and easter eggs here and there. There are also scenes of leo hunting the drug shops as usual in between.

Then there is a flashback (optional). Leo is not actually a son of Antony das like shown in the movie. He is Antony's henchman and he kills people for him. There is naa ready dhaa song there and all. But he realises the bad effects of drugs due to some incidents. He leaves antony's gang and decides to destroy the drug mafia. This flashback is completely optional and it can be removed if it is not necessary. (The naa ready song can be placed in present timeline too)

At present, Parthiban and leo confusion continues and antony decides to kill Parthiban and his family and then fight ensures between Parthiban and antony's men and Parthiban and Antony das and in the climax it is revealed that leo and Parthiban are the same person. At day time, he is Parthiban, a coffee shop owner and at night, he takes the alter ego of leo das and fights crime. Parthiban kills Antony. And then the next day, agent vikram calls him (who somehow knows that Parthiban and leo are same) and asks him to help him in making the society a drug free society. The end.

So that's it guys. I think this rewrite would suit leo better because it fits in with the alter ego thing that they told in posters and also it also fits into the lcu more organically. I would also change the name of the movie from leo to something else. What do you guys think about this ?

1n824b3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n824b3,Amaran Oxana Black Review: YSL Black Opium for only $17!?,"If you’ve ever been seduced by the sweet and vanilla allure of YSL Black Opium, but balked at the price tag ($172 for 3 oz at Ulta), let me introduce you to your new obsession: Amaran Oxana Black.

I found this at my local Marshall’s for an unbelievable $16.99. I mean, how can you beat that? There were more than a couple bottles out of the box so you could walk up and test them right in the store. These are also found quite often at TJ Maxx and Burlington.

I am a male and it’s been said that YSL Black Opium “makes the men go crazy.” So I had to check it out.

On the opening spray, I get a strong dose of seductive sweetness coming from the pear and orange blossom. This is said to be coffee heavy, but to me, I get the depth from coffee in the background. Sweetness, fresh white florals, vanilla and a powdery accord lead the show. Then you get the licorice, bitter almond, and earthy patchouli. There’s just something sexy about this scent, and I think it’s coming from the mix of licorice and patchouli.

My mind immediately goes to date nights and cozy romantic evenings. This may not be a great option for everyday versatility. It’s bold and mysterious… I imagine a confident woman who is grown and sexy wearing this scent. I get the vibe that women 30+ will gravitate more to this scent profile. 

Oxana Black also reminds me a lot of La Vie Est Belle. But it’s been awhile since I’ve smelled that, and I am far from being well versed in all the women’s perfumes. Is this similar to LVEB?

I’ve heard great things about another dupe of YSL Black Opium from Maison Alhambra called Opera Noir. Has anyone had a chance to compare this Oxana Black to Opera Noir? I think someone needs to do a head to head.

The true magic to these clones: Longevity and sillage. Many reviewers report that these two clones even outperform the original. Pretty impressive for a fragrance under $20!!

All in all, Amaran Oxana Black is a perfect balance of sensuality and sophistication. 

Yes, it’s sexy, exotic, and mysterious. 

Is it the best perfume that I’d prefer to smell all the time on a woman? Probably not. 

But I can absolutely see why it’s earned the reputation for putting men in a chokehold.

For $16.99, this would be a great scent profile to add to your collection and is attainable for so many.

Keep your eyes peeled at those rack stores!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.“Just a few spots to sign.”Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.But he hadn’t come back alone.My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.’I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.”I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’My throat tightened painfully.My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.Firm. Bold. Unwavering.Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.‘We do’, I agreed.Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.I hit send without hesitation.The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing — something Amelia would never allow.Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.I had my dignity.After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.“Come in,” I said.Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.“Luna Olivia,” he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. “Alpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.”Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set — necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.Disgust crawled up my throat.“Alpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.” Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.“How thoughtful of him,” I said. “Even with his busy schedule and all” I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.Reed flinched slightly. “I should get back,” He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights.My stomach twisted in disgust.Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I’d just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that’s what it felt like.By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.My eyes narrowed instinctively.That’s when I spotted Ethan’s car, parked near the exit.Through the window, I caught a glimpse—Ethan, sitting in the back seat.And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn’t have a care in the world.Reed was behind the wheel.The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.For a heartbeat, everything went still.My eyes locked with Ethan’s through the glass.Chapter 2Olivia’s POVI recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan — it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.She didn’t even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn’t stop her.I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.I hadn’t been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace — something simple to go with tomorrow’s blazer — when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.I didn’t need to look to know who it was.A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.I didn’t turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.“Are you upset?” he asked.“Obviously,” I said, still not looking at him. “You should be careful next time.”He didn’t respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. “The Windsor pack’s Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I’ve been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.”I nodded slightly and turned to face him. “So to secure the alliance, it’s necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?”His jaw flexed. He didn’t answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn’t expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.“I'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.”I stared at him for a second.“You don’t need to explain anything to me,” I said. “If you’re tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I’ll leave.”His face darkened. “What did you just say?”I didn’t flinch. “I said we can get a divorce and break the bond.”I stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.“Don’t ever say that again,” he said, voice low.I didn’t respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.But inside, I already knew — I wasn’t saying it for effect.I’d been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn’t want him anymore.Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha’s private office most of the evening, didn’t eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn’t close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman’s voice on the other end — crying.The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava — a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole’s latest post.It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: “Enjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.”I stared at the photo.One of those hands was Ethan’s. I’d know that scar near his thumb anywhere.I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.The following days, Ethan didn’t return home.At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn’t go upstairs to his office, and he didn’t come down to mine.In the evenings, I started browsing house listings — somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn’t mean anything to me anymore.One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar—I'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.I almost said no. But then I remembered — if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I’d have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.“Sure,” I texted back.When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.“Glad to see you Olivia,” she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.“Me too,” I tried to fake smile.She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.There were people on the other side — laughing, drinking, talking loud — but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan’s circle. She smiled at me — tight, awkward.I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.My name.From the other side of the screen.“She hasn’t been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?”“Well, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.”“She’s the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she’s a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.”“Still, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what — eight years? He’s probably tired of her even though they are mates.”There was a pause. Then a chuckle.“Shame. She wasted her best years. I’d still take a go at her, though.”The cup froze in my hand.I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.The laughter faded when they saw me.I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who’d spoken last.“Isn’t it a bit unfair?” I asked. “You make it sound like I’ve been living off him.”They blinked.I took a sip.“Ethan was a virgin before we got together. So if I’ve been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying — sounds like I got the better deal, doesn’t it?Silence. The whole room had gone still.Most of them just stared— and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.Chapter 3Olivia’s POVI smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.Alpha Ethan.I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me —her eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim — made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.That’s when it clicked.This wasn’t some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle — people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn’t their first. They didn’t even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.Ethan walked toward me.Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. “Olivia, we were just messing around—none of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.”Another added, “Really sorry. We didn’t mean anything by it.”I didn’t respond.Ethan reached for my wrist.“Let’s go,” he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.I didn’t fight.Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.I smiled faintly, “Please, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won’t interrupt again.”Then I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.His grip only tightened.His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.I kicked instinctively. “Ethan—put me down!”He didn’t respond.We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn’t loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands — each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up — and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.Sharp and captivating.They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan’s shoulder like some helpless object.Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.I didn’t know why I felt that way. But I didn’t like it. It unsettled me.Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.Then he finally spoke. “Why were you there? You came to catch me, didn’t you?”As he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.A foil wrapper — gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.A condom.The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.“I’m not staying in this car,” I said.He pulled me back roughly. “Where do you think you’re going?”“Home,” I said, my breathing uneven. “I want to go home.”“Stop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.”I didn’t answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.“Harold!” Ethan called out toward the club. “Drive.”Harold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.Only then did I feel something close to normal.When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn’t ask why.I sat down across from him.It was quiet for a while. Then he said, “I was there to talk business. A new project.”I said nothing.“You showing up and making a scene like that — it embarrassed me.”He kept going. “You looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.”I stared at him.He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.“Is that all?” I asked.His brows drew together. “If you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don’t have time for your insane suspicions.”I nodded. “Got it. Anything else?”He stared at me. “Do you know how annoying you are right now?”I stood up slowly.He won’t be annoyed much longer.I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn’t touch.That didn’t stop him.He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.By morning, I hadn’t slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself — toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn’t say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.He leaned in close to my ear.“This weekend,” he said gently, “let’s go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.”I took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. “Hmm.”That was it.On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to Washington for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.I wasn’t surprised. I didn’t feel anything — no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.Maybe he hasn’t noticed we haven’t shared a meal in weeks. We don’t talk. We don’t go anywhere. We don’t spend time like people in a marriage — not even like people who live under the same roof.He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn’t exist to him.If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.Melina.I hesitated, then picked up. “Hello, Luna Melina.” Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.She snorted arrogantly. “Come over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.”I paused. “Is that really necessary?”She didn’t hesitate. “If I say so.”""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""Chapter 4Olivia’s POVI arrived atHawthorne Manoraround 11 AM.As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.“Yay! I won again!” The girl’s tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. “Are you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?”I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn’t need to see her to know who it was.Chole Windsor.I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.I took a slow breath, letting Yve’s quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. “What are you doing here?”I walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn’t bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,“Your mom didn’t tel you? She called me.” I continued, “Didn’t know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?”His jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn’t respond.Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.“Hi,” she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. “I’m Chole Windsor. It’s nice to meet you.”I looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.“Chole, darling,” she said, taking Chole’s hand in both of hers,“I hope you’re having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.”I felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.Melina’s eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.“Ah, Olivia. You’re here.”She turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.“This is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She’s here on business.”It took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son’s wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn’t even try to defend my position.“Didn’t you say we had business to discuss? Let’s get it over with.”Melina’s smile tightened slightly.“We can discuss it another day. You’re here now, so why not join us for a meal?”I exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.“I’m not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.”I turned to leave, my back already to them.Her voice sharpened,“I am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.”I paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.“Fine. I’ll stay for a meal.”I met her gaze without blinking.“Just make sure you don’t regret it.”Chole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,“Oh, that’s perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I’d love to keep playing.”I glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn’t even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new — probably Chole’s idea.Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple — players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.Chole’s eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.“Oh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?”I met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.“Only a little,”I replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.“Wanna play?”Ethan’s jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.“Of course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?” Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.“Go ahead. I’ll watch.” I stepped back, casually folding my arms.Chole’s smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.She turned back to me,“Almost nailed it.”Behind her, Melina’s eyes followed the ring,“Chole. So graceful.”Chole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.I didn’t bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.Chole’s smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.“Lucky shot.”I let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.“Maybe.”I shrugged,“Last time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.”The remark hit its mark. Chole’s face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.Melina stepped in quickly,“Dear, it’s just a game. The important thing is to have fun.”I shrugged, stepping back.“Of course. But some people get carried away too easily.”I didn’t miss the way Melina’s eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around theMoon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole’s throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.Melina’s expression grew more strained with each missed attempt, her jaw clenching tighter every time I hit my mark. She glanced at Ethan, as if hoping for some intervention, but he remained silent.I stepped back, dusted my hands lightly, then walked to the nearby sofa. I set my final ring down on the polished side table, folding my hands neatly in my lap, my eyes meeting theirs without flinching.“Want to keep playing?”I asked, my tone light, almost bored.Chole’s hand curled tightly around the last ring, her knuckles turning pale, lips pressed into a thin, strained line.Melina shot me a sharp, furious look, her eyes narrowing into thin, dangerous slits.",1,1756964859.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1n81z6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phobia/comments/1n81z6a/fear_of_liquids_other_than_water_and_milk/,Fear of liquids other than water and milk?,"Hello! I have some sort of fear (potentially phobia) that I’ve never met anyone else who shares it. I am truly afraid of all liquids that are not pure water or cow milk/chocolate milk.

I have never had anything to drink in my entire life except those two options. That includes juice, tea, coffee, soda, alcohol, and even sparkling/flavored water or other types of milk. All of those liquids just feel incredibly dirty to me.

I joke that it is a health choice, but I am completely fearful of being around any other liquids. I want to crawl out of my skin if I sit at a table with someone drinking anything else. I have a very physical, spastic reaction if I have to hold a cup of another liquid. I try to avoid being in the driver’s seat if I’m going through a drive thru with others so that I don’t have to grab their fountain drink. I cringe at watching others drink these liquids, hearing cans or bottles open, or even hearing the names of these beverages. I hate the word “beverages.” 

I feel awful going out to eat with friends or family because they can tell that I am having intense reactions to what they are drinking, so they often don’t order them. My girlfriend stays over on the weekends, and it can be a tough choice for her on whether or not to have a Friday night drink in my house. I do not want to limit the people around me from enjoying themselves, and I ask them to drink what they want, but the idea of even sitting next to a drink like that makes me cry.

I cannot think of any traumatic experiences I’ve had relating to beverages, but I did go through a significant amount of urinary medical trauma as a kid, so maybe that’s it.

I usually use the fact that I’ve never had anything else to drink as a quirky tidbit about me, people find it interesting. I’m not really looking to start drinking anything else (my health genuinely does not need that, haha). I guess I’m just wondering if this has a name, or if others have experienced this? Is it possible to become comfortable at least sitting next to or holding a cup of another liquid?

My diet is predominantly meat, and I try to stick to free-range, grass-fed etc.

Lately, I sometimes add some cheese slices (block of cheese, not that plastic, processed shit) to some of my meat dishes, just to add variety and taste. Certainly not all the time. I stick predominantly to fat drippings for oil, sometimes butter, occasionally avocado oil, and very occasionally EVOO. I only use salt, pepper and fish oil for seasoning. I eat plenty of eggs, and will occasionally add some avocados to the diet. 

Snacks are usually biltong sticks, as I recently realised how much sugar is in jerky! I will occasionally eat pork crackling as a snack, but I try to get in flavoured.

I have started adding a small amount of dairy to some meals (usually cheese) and still add full cream milk to my coffee (though far less these days). I have next to 0 sugar in my diet, and have severely reduced my processed meat intake. 

I have lost just over 5kg in approx 1 month, target is 15kg by end of year. I'm about to start increasing exercise, as I've been way too dormant lately.

For added information, I suffer from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. My liver function was only avg. (high lipids), so I have greatly reduced alcohol intake. My heart calcium score is zero (that was good news!), but I do have high blood pressure.

Anyone suggest any changes I should make, or am I on the right track?

1n81wck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/1n81wck/fear_of_hypos_strike_again/,Fear of hypos strike again,"I’ve had a consistent fear of lows since being diagnosed. It’s gotten better; I used to be afraid of being at 90, so I was running so much higher than I should’ve been. 

But the fear remains. 

 I’ve had a few Cgm slip ups (closed loop system) that caused my blood sugar to drop. I’ve woken up to feeling mysteriously shaky, only to realize I’m at 50, not 130 like the Cgm said. I’ve taken to setting a four hour alarm on nights I’m afraid, so I can wake up and manually test before going back to bed, or even - if I’m really terrified - having something before bed and letting myself run around 130 instead of 110. 

But the fear remains. 

I hear stories of people dying from lows, losing friends and family members unexpectedly. I let my family see my readings out of fear i wont be able to help myself, or I’ll be alone, but that doesn’t help if the CGM doesn’t work in the first place. 

The anxiety feels like a low, so I check. The low feels like anxiety, so it reinforces the fear. I do a second test, just to be sure, even if it’s an expected number. It’s becoming an OCD-like behavior. 
 I get an extra snack. I bring more tablets. I overcorrect. I get a bigger coffee. I underdose. Because I’m scared to die from hypoglycemia. My endocrinologist sees the numbers and I say I’ll do better but it’s literally paralyzing.

1n81u4s,https://i.redd.it/d9khp5e843nf1.jpeg,IIM Survival Tips: Tougher Than Cracking CAT,"When you finally walk through those IIM gates, the excitement is real... but so is the chaos. Everyone tells you about the glory of ""making it"" - not enough people tell you how to survive it.

Here's what no one tells you until you're in the thick of it:

**1. Your Google Calendar will be your oxygen.** Classes at 8:30 AM, a surprise quiz at 10, group meeting at 2, case comp deadline at 6, cultural event practice at 9... and somewhere in between, you'll need to eat, sleep, and exist. Time-block everything. Even naps.

**2. Submissions will haunt you in your dreams.** And sometimes, you'll finish them just minutes before the portal closes. Learn the art of starting early - ""last minute"" works once or twice, but burnout comes fast.

3. Your batchmates are your biggest allies. That ""random"" group you're assigned to? They might become your 3 AM chai partners, your presentation saviours, and your sanity keepers. **Invest in people - it's the best ROI you'll get.**

**4. Impostor syndrome is normal** - don't let it eat you. You'll sit next to people who've worked at global firms, won national competitions, or coded apps for fun. Remind yourself: you earned your seat too.

**5. Health is not optional. Skipping meals, living on coffee, ignoring exercise - it feels manageable until it's not. Energy is your real currency here. Protect it.**

**6. Learn to say NO. Clubs, committees, hackathons, networking meets - you can't do it all.** Pick what aligns with your goals and let go of the rest without guilt.

By the end of your IIM journey, you'll realize it's less about grades and more about grit. You'll leave with sharper skills, lifelong friends, and stories that'l make you smile years later.

So yes - crack CAT. **But more importantly, get ready to thrive once you're in. Because inside an IIM, survival isn't just about getting through the day**... it's about becoming someone stronger than you imagined. It's too much but believe me once you are inside you will genuinely go through these phases.

P. S - you can definitely appreciate the beauty of campus ! It's really hard to ignore ..

I am very much NOT the type of man who wants the ""provider"" role. I almost solely date via apps since I meet almost no one organically anymore. This makes it feel that much worse, because I could see a situation where I meet a woman IRL, feel a connection, and want to pursue her a bit. But a stranger from an app? Why am I paying just to meet and see if I'm interested?

In the end I am fine with paying for a relatively inexpensive date or two (I now do drinks maximum for a first date, coffee preferably) but even in paying for those, I'm setting the precedent that I will likely continue to foot the bill long-term. I get that discussions can be had about money, but that looks pretty tacky after 2 dates, and I'm so fed up that it's not even worth it to me, I'd rather just disappear.

I did some research and most surveys still find that men are typically spending way more on their relationship than their significant other is, and it is just insane to me. I'm told that women typically contribute in other ways besides money, and they list things like cooking, cleaning, child care, etc... Things that many women in 2025 are opting out of entirely. At best, these are things that only come to fruition after moving in together and/or getting married, which means the man investing financially for at least a year or two before getting basically any contribution in return. I have not benefitted from any of these things aside from a handful of meals cooked for me in 15+ years of dating.

In the end I have to blame men for the current state of things, because they are not only allowing it but many apparently ENJOY being used financially. Men who WANT to pay... why? How does having less money in your bank account while her balance goes up make you feel like more of a man? It's 2025, most women my age make similar if not more money than I do, and have WAY more expensive taste. It's not only that I'm going out and paying $150 for 2 dinners, I actually would have spent like $20 max if I had gone out by myself.

I don’t know if I’m naturally ace or not. 
I was abused as a kid, I’m autistic and I’m a trans man. I started dating early (because it’s the easiest way to not be at home) my mom set me up with the first one I was going into freshmen year so was he… in college. It only spiraled worse from there. 12 different people and I thought I was ace for almost all of them. 

I swore off sex or penetration because I was ace I didn’t need it I didn’t feel arosed I didn’t get wet or whatever I just did what I had to to get by and got good at certain things (in my experience only the worst men won’t take a bj in exchange for sex if you don’t want it) 

And then I got out of that house and situation, I got off meds and straightened out my health. Got on testosterone, felt more comfortable with myself. 

But suddenly I was a gay man, out of nowhere when literally last year I was a deeply traumatized church girl. And NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HOW BIG A GAP THAT IS 

ALL GAY SPACES ARE SO SEXUAL every one I know every friend I have everywhere all the time it’s either be ok with people groping you or don’t hang out at gay bars and spaces 

And I know there coffee shops and what not but that doesn’t help when you still have to do it alone. 

So over the past year I really really dug down and tried to find compelling porn and get to know myself and work on making things not hurt and trigger and awful anymore and I’ve done pretty ok ! 

But it’s been all on my own I’ve had no help, or partner or support in anything and it’s been so hard. It’s like a chicken or the egg. 

I’ve found that I am attracted to things, the same things I was when I was a kid, (Wolverine or now bearded men in leather jackets ) 

I like the rules and the structure of bdsm it feels safe and non nebulous like sex normally is. But that’s hard to try with people  or find in people when you don’t know them and they don’t know you. 

I could live the rest of my life never having sex and be fine but I don’t want too 

I want to try things and have all the safety and caring and emotional bullshit of sex I think I’m probably capable of it if I do it right

I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong here I’ve been working at this for years and especially now that I’m away from all the old abuse I want get rid of all whatever this is too. 

But sex is so much godamn work, I don’t understand how anyone can love it or want it enough to hookup from grinder let alone every night like so many people do how often are they washing their sheets ?? Cleaning their toys ??? Cleaning themselves, getting ready talking to people. How do you have the time ?!!!!!!! We’re in a recession! 

I just wish I could magically meet a partner who liked me enough outside of sex to help pull me along into liking it more but that’s such a thankless task to burden someone with. 

Idk is it too much to ask for someone to  help ?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



If someone had told me that love could survive betrayal, I would have laughed in their face. The night I signed my divorce papers, I told myself it was the end of my marriage, of the man I once loved, and of the life I thought we'd have together. James had been my everything until I learned he wasn't mine at all, not in the way a husband should be.

I packed away the memories like fragile glass, determined never to touch them again. He moved on, or so I believed, and I built a new life without him.

But the thing about endings is that they don't always stay that way. Sometimes, life circles back, pushing you face-to-face with the one person you swore you'd never forgive. Sometimes the love you thought was shattered still has pieces sharp enough to cut and strong enough to hold you together if you're brave enough to try.

I didn't know it then, but our story wasn't over. It was only waiting for the right time to begin again.



The road to the house hadn't changed much. The same crooked wooden sign still marked the turnoff like a secret only they knew. The trees on either side leaned in slightly, branches brushing against each other overhead, forming that gentle tunnel of green that Violet used to love in the spring. The silence between them in the car stretched longer than the road itself. Only the soft hum of tires against pavement and the occasional shuffle of her husband's hand on the steering wheel filled the void.

James hadn't said much since they left the city. She hadn't expected him to. She sat with her hands folded in her lap, the leather of the seat cool against her palms. Outside, the town she once called home blurred past with coffee shops, old gas stations, the faded yellow school building that used to fill her days with routine and meaning. It had been five years since she walked out of that classroom for the last time. Three since she stopped calling anywhere home.

But her mind wasn't here.

It was still there, a month and a half ago, standing barefoot in their kitchen, clutching a chipped mug of cold tea while her husband, the man she had loved for eleven years, calmly, clinically, ended their marriage.

""I've met someone,"" he said, as if he were discussing the weather. ""And I want to be with her.""

He hadn't even looked at her when he said it. He'd been standing by the sink, sleeves rolled to the elbow, the buttons of his white shirt misaligned by one. The left cuff was still damp from washing his hands.

""Her name is Alice. You've met her once or twice and she used to be in my architecture program. We've reconnected recently, and... I realized I feel something real with her. Something I haven't felt in a long time.""

She remembered the way her stomach dropped. Not sharply, not all at once. It was slow and heavy like something precious sliding off a table, falling in stages before it hit the ground.

""You feel something real with her,"" she echoed, more to herself than to him.

He nodded. Like a man who had already made his peace.

""I'm not happy anymore,"" he added. ""Neither of us are, if we're being honest. This isn't working, and I don't think it has been for a long time. I don't want to keep pretending.""

Pretending.

She wanted to scream then. Wanted to shatter the mug in her hand, throw it across the room and demand to know when he had decided she wasn't enough but her body betrayed her. She just stood there, still as stone, trying to hold in every crack.

""I don't want to hurt you,"" he said.

As if he hadn't already carved her in half with every word. She blinked at him, once. Then again. The words tasted like ash before they even left her mouth.

""Is it that Alice? Your first love?"" she asked, her voice a brittle whisper.

He hesitated a bit too long.

That was enough.

""I thought so,"" she said, nodding slowly. ""You didn't even bother to hide it, James. The late nights. The texts. You used to have the decency to lie. Pretend you were working. Now you don't even care.""

He let out a quiet breath, running a hand down his face.

""I didn't mean for it to happen like this.""

""You didn't mean to cheat on your wife?"" she snapped, the crack finally splitting through her voice. ""You didn't mean to throw away eleven years for some unfinished fantasy from college?""

""Violet—""

""Why?"" Her voice broke. ""Why her? What does she have that I don't? What makes Alice worth destroying this life we built?""

James looked away and that told her more than any answer ever could.

""Was it the way she looks?"" she whispered. ""The fact that she still laughs at your dry jokes? That she wasn't there when you were broke and starting over? That she doesn't know how dark it got after your father died? That she never had to love you when you were angry and empty and pushing everyone away?""

""It's not about that.""

""Then what?"" she asked, eyes shining now. ""What did I do that made you stop choosing me?""

Silence stretched. Long and sharp.

""Do you still love me?"" she asked, so quietly it was almost a prayer.

He finally looked at her.

""I... care about you. You've always been good to me.""

Her throat tightened. That wasn't the answer. It wasn't even close.

""But I'm in love with Alice,"" he finished.

And there it was.

Violet swallowed the sob pressing up her throat. Her hands trembled as she set the mug down on the counter with careful, deliberate calm. Her whole body wanted to scream but her pride held firm.

""Don't fight the divorce,"" James said after a pause. ""Don't make this ugly. I just want to move on. Alice and I—we want to be together. It's time.""

""And what about us?"" she asked, barely above a whisper. ""What about our vows? For better or worse?""

He shook his head.

""We've both known for a while that this wasn't working,"" he said. ""You just didn't want to see it. Don't drag this out, Violet. I'm done pretending.""

She didn't remember much after that, just the low hum in her ears, the quiet clink of dishes in the sink, the sound of his footsteps leaving the room.

She stood there for a long time. Maybe hours and when night fell, she lay in their bed, turned away from him, feeling like a stranger in her own life. The end hadn't come like a thunderclap. It came like a cold draft through a door left slightly open and she hadn't noticed until it was too late to close it.

That night she didn't cry. She just curled into her side of the bed and stared at the wall until her eyes dried out. The space between them in the bed felt like a canyon. He didn't touch her. Didn't even try.

It was the next day, when she saw his phone light up with Alice's name, he hadn't even bothered to silence her texts and that she broke. She excused herself, walked to the bathroom, and sobbed into a towel until her throat burned. He didn't knock on the door. He never asked if she was okay.

Later that afternoon, Violet found herself sitting alone on a worn wooden bench at the park a few blocks from their apartment. The wind was cool, the air sharp with the scent of wet leaves and distant traffic. Children laughed in the distance, their joy ringing out like a language she no longer understood.

She sat with her coat wrapped tightly around her, hands buried in the pockets, eyes fixed on the swing set that creaked softly in the breeze. Her breath fogged in front of her in slow, broken exhalations.

She didn't know how long she'd been sitting there. Fifteen minutes, maybe forty. Time had become elastic lately, stretched out and useless.

Her mind reeled, looping back through years of marriage like a movie she didn't want to pause. The good years. The beginning. The soft mornings and burnt toast. Their first house with the leaky sink and the crooked picture frames. The way James used to come home exhausted from site meetings, his shoulders heavy until she pecked him at the door. The silly names they gave their potted plants. The way he used to reach for her hand in his sleep.

When had it started to slip?

She couldn't trace the exact moment. There wasn't one single fight, no great betrayal she could point to until Alice entered the picture. It was like a slow erosion, something imperceptible, like the way sand is carried off the shore in grains until the whole beach looks different and no one remembers how it used to be.

Violet closed her eyes. She had always been alone until James. No parents. No siblings. Just years of boarding schools, silent holidays, and distant foster homes. Her whole life, she had craved something of her own. Something permanent. Something that wouldn't leave.

And James, he had been all of that. Her best friend. Her family. Her anchor. She had loved him with the kind of love you give when you don't know if you'll ever be loved again.

So was it wrong to want him to stay?

Wrong to fight for something that had once meant everything to them both?

The world said love was supposed to be selfless. That if you truly loved someone, you'd let them go so they could be happy even if that happiness wasn't with you. But for once, Violet didn't want to be selfless. She was tired of being the one who gave, who waited, who understood.

She wanted to be selfish. Just this once. She wanted something to belong to her. Not out of pity. Not out of obligation but because she had earned it. This life, this marriage, this man who once promised forever.

The wind blew through her hair, lifting strands across her face. Her eyes stung, and somewhere deep inside her, a quiet decision began to form. She wasn't going to beg but she wasn't going to let go, not just yet.

That night, she came home to find James seated at the dining table, working on something on his laptop, blueprints splayed around him like a fortress. He didn't look up when she stepped inside. Didn't ask where she'd been.

She stood there in silence for a moment, watching the man she once knew better than herself, a man she now felt like a stranger to.

""I want something from you,"" she said finally, her voice soft but firm.

That got his attention. He looked up, brows pulling together. ""What is it?""

She stepped closer, unbuttoning her coat with slow, deliberate movements. ""Before we finalize the divorce. Before we sign anything.""

James leaned back in his chair, arms folding. Defensive already. ""You want more money?""

Her laugh was bitter. ""No, James. I don't want your money. I want time.""

His frown deepened. ""Time for what?""

""One month,"" she said. ""At the old place. The first one we lived in. The little blue house with the broken porch and the wild ivy. Remember it?""

He blinked, caught off guard. ""You want to move back there?""

""Not move. Just... stay. Together. For one month.""

He stared at her like she'd gone mad. ""Why?""

Violet hesitated, then said quietly, ""Because I want to know when it really ended. I want to know if it was just time that wore us down, or if we really stopped trying.""

His jaw tensed, but he didn't speak.

""I'm not asking to fix anything,"" she continued. ""I just want to see us. Without distractions. Without Alice's name blinking on your screen. Just us on how we started and before we walk away forever.""

He looked at her for a long time, the seconds dragging between them like a standoff. Violet could see the battle behind his eyes. The suspicion, the confusion and the exhaustion but underneath all of that, she saw something else too. A flicker of the man who once used to build her breakfast forts out of pancakes and Post-its.

One month.

It wasn't much but maybe it could be enough to find the answers they both owed themselves and so, when James finally nodded once, slow and reluctant, Violet exhaled for the first time all day.

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as they pulled into the familiar driveway. The house looked smaller than she remembered. The paint had faded, and the front steps had begun to splinter at the edges, but the porch swing was still there, swaying gently in the breeze like it had been waiting.

She blinked back something in her throat and reached for the door handle. Her husband stepped out first. He grabbed their bags from the trunk without a word. She didn't offer to help. She just stood there, staring at the home where she once imagined raising children, celebrating anniversaries, watching him grow old beside her.

The key turned in the lock with a groan of protest, as if the door hadn't been opened in years. Violet stepped inside first. The air smelled faintly of dust and something nostalgic of old wood, lavender from a candle long melted down, the ghost of their first home.

She paused in the doorway, her gaze sweeping over the small living room. Nothing had changed. The same uneven hardwood floors. The crooked bookshelf James once insisted he didn't need instructions for. The mismatched couch cushions she sewed by hand. Even the dent in the wall from their first real fight was still there.

It felt like walking into a photograph. Familiar, and yet distant. Like something that had belonged to someone else.

James came in behind her, rolling in one suitcase. ""I thought you said you'd bring your things tomorrow.""

""I wanted to settle in a little first,"" she said quietly, moving further into the house.

He didn't reply.

""I'll take the upstairs room,"" he said, brushing past her.

She nodded.

He disappeared through the front door.

She stood alone at the living room for a few seconds longer, eyes scanning every corner of the house they once called theirs and for the first time in weeks, she let herself whisper the question that had haunted her since that day in the kitchen.

When did I stop being enough?

She stepped inside, and the door closed behind her with a soft click, like the start of something, or the end of everything.



They spent the next hour in near silence. Violet opened the windows. James checked the plumbing. Neither spoke unless they had to. It was like two strangers forced to share space. Two shadows of who they used to be.

Later, she found herself in the kitchen, her favorite room once. She ran her fingers along the countertop, remembering the flour fights, the midnight wine, the way James used to lean against the fridge just to watch her hum along to the radio. That version of them felt impossibly far away.

""You still like chamomile?"" he asked from the doorway, holding up a box of tea.

She blinked, startled by the question. ""Yeah. I do.""

He nodded and set the box down. They sat at the tiny table, facing each other like awkward dinner guests. The silence between them wasn't hostile, just... hollow. Like everything that had once filled it with jokes, laughter, soft Sunday mornings had been swept away.

Violet looked up from her cup. ""You don't have to act like we're strangers, James.""

""I don't know how else to act,"" he said honestly.

That stung. She nodded slowly, eyes on her tea.

""I used to know everything about you,"" she said, her voice soft. ""Now I don't even know what time you go to bed.""

""Late,"" he muttered. ""Usually around two. I work better at night.""

She nodded again. ""I go to bed early now. Around nine. I wake up at five to catch sunrises.""

""You always liked mornings.""

""You always hated them.""

A small, crooked smile tugged at his lips. ""Some things never change.""

""No,"" she agreed. ""But a lot of things did.""

They finished their tea in silence. When she stood to rinse her cup, James spoke again.

""Why did you really ask for this month?""

Violet turned, bracing her hands against the sink. ""Because I wanted to remember who we were before it all fell apart and I wanted to see if the version of me that existed with you still exists at all.""

He didn't say anything to that.

""I know you love her,"" she said quietly, without looking at him. ""And I know this won't change anything but I needed this, for me.""

A long beat passed before he finally spoke. ""Alright.""

Violet didn't ask what he meant by that.

They both knew.

That night, they slept in separate rooms. The silence between them wasn't as sharp as it had been. Still heavy and sad but quieter. Like the beginning of an ache finally starting to dull.

Violet lay awake in the guest room, staring at the ceiling fan as it spun in slow, hypnotic circles. The sheets were clean but unfamiliar, and the mattress was too soft or maybe it was just the silence that kept her alert. She turned over again and again.

Finally, giving up, she rose from the bed and padded out into the hallway, barefoot and quiet. A sliver of golden light glowed beneath James's door. She hesitated, hand raised to knock, heart tugged by the memory of how he used to stay up working late, drafting blueprints with jazz humming from his speakers.

Maybe he was still awake. Maybe they could talk. Just for a little while. She stepped closer but before her knuckles could make contact, she froze. His voice which was quiet, low, but unmistakably James slipped through the narrow crack of the door.

""Alice... I know. I miss you too.""

Violet's breath caught.

She had heard that name for months but it still hit like a slap.

""It's just a month. That's all. I promised Violet I'd give her that. Closure, she said. After that, we'll make everything official. No more hiding, no more guilt. I just... need you to understand that I won't be in much contact until then.""

Silence.

Then James's voice again, tired, but firm.

""Yes. I'll be here with her. No distractions. I owe her that much, at least.""

A pause.

""Alice, come on. This isn't about second chances. It's about finishing what we started with some dignity. Please don't make this harder. You know I love you right?""

Violet backed away slowly, every nerve in her body on fire, her pulse pounding in her ears. She didn't wait to hear more. She didn't need to. She turned and moved down the hallway with practiced silence, slipping into the guest room and quietly closing the door behind her.

Her hands trembled as she leaned back against the frame. Her chest felt tight, like it was folding in on itself. She clutched the edge of the dresser for balance, staring blankly at the mirror.

Closure.

That's all she was to him now, a task to be completed. A promise made out of obligation. A goodbye wrapped in polite guilt. Violet had known, of course. She wasn't naïve but hearing it, hearing him say her name like that, hearing the softness in his voice he hadn't used with her in years—it broke something in her. Quietly. Irrevocably.

She slid down to the floor, knees pulled to her chest, and for the first time in months, she let the tears fall freely. Not because she still loved him but because she finally understood. He didn't see this month the way she did.

To him, it was a closing chapter.

To her, it had still been a question mark.

Now it was a full stop.

**What is A2 Gir Cow Ghee?**

A2 Gir Cow Ghee is a traditional clarified butter made from the milk of indigenous Gir cows of India. Unlike commercial ghee, it is prepared using the Bilona method, where curd from Gir cow’s A2 milk is hand-churned and slowly heated to extract pure golden ghee.

**Key points that make A2 Gir Cow Ghee special:**

* Contains A2 beta-casein protein, easier to digest than A1 protein found in foreign cow breeds.  
* Rich in Omega-3, Omega-6 fatty acids, butyric acid, and vitamins A, D, E, and K.  
* Free from chemicals, preservatives, and artificial processing.  
* Known for its Ayurvedic medicinal properties, especially for brain and gut health.  

This nutritional richness makes it a natural brain tonic for students and working professionals.

# Why the Brain Needs Natural Fuel

The human brain uses about 20% of the body’s total energy despite being just 2% of body weight. To stay alert, focused, and creative, it requires high-quality nutrients and fats.

* Glucose and healthy fats are the primary fuels for brain function.  
* Deficiency in good fats can lead to poor memory, fatigue, and brain fog.  
* Artificial stimulants may give temporary energy but don’t support long-term brain health.  

This is where [Gir Cow A2 Ghee](https://www.gavyamart.in/products/a2-ghee) becomes essential, as it provides sustained energy, improves neurotransmitter function, and enhances cognitive performance.

# Cognitive Benefits of A2 Gir Cow Ghee

# 1. Enhances Memory and Concentration

A2 Gir Cow Ghee is rich in DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), a type of Omega-3 fatty acid crucial for brain cell development. Regular consumption improves memory retention, making it an excellent supplement for students preparing for exams.

# 2. Boosts Mental Clarity

Professionals working in high-pressure environments often face brain fog. The healthy saturated fats in [A2 ghee](https://www.gavyamart.in/products/a2-ghee) act as a clean fuel source for the brain, ensuring clarity and better decision-making.

# 3. Supports Stress Management

Chronic stress depletes brain energy. A2 Gir Cow Ghee nourishes the nervous system, stabilizes mood, and helps manage anxiety naturally without side effects.

# 4. Improves Sleep Quality

Good sleep is essential for learning and productivity. Consuming a teaspoon of A2 ghee with warm milk before bed improves digestion and promotes deep, restful sleep.

# 5. Anti-Inflammatory Properties

Neuroinflammation is linked to poor memory and low productivity. A2 ghee contains butyric acid, a na**t**ural anti-inflammatory agent that protects brain cells.

1n81jbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cultsurvivors/comments/1n81jbx/experience_with_world_mission_society/,"Experience with ""World Mission Society""","I was approached at a target in May of this year \[2025\]. Two African-American women asked if I was interested in learning about God the Mother. Curiosity and boredom got me to agree to a few bible studies, but I knew immediately this was a cult, like I immediately had that sense lol. EDIT: The first thing I mentioned tho was my refusal to tolerate using religion ro justify bigotry, which they agreed with (surface level recruitment tactic im sure as I read later this cult is very anti-lgbt).

I never had any intention of going to their church, giving them my address, or legitimately joining. \[never did and still don't, but after distancing myself this week I wanted to tell my story about it somewhere.\]

When the woman who approached me spoke to me, she was absolutely dissociated/spaced out while listening to my answer. it was straight up creepy lmao.

the first studies were the stories of all souls being angels who sinned in heaven, then Passover, and throughout the second and third studies she would pause and say ""so do you wanna keep the Passover?"" \[red flag again lmfao\] and I told them obviously the answer they're looking for is yes but there's no way I personally am going to be able to.

the same thing happened in the sabbath studies, they'd stop and say so, do you wanna keep the sabbath? and there was a lot of prompting me to finish their sentences / thoughts with the answers I knew they were looking for, which I see how someone who doesn't have any prior knowledge/foundation could be led by the repetition to memorize, internalize, and believe what they're saying.

Then she handed the studies over to a man. She always attended, but he led the studies. He gave me studies about the bible being a book of prophecy and why we can believe it's true. they told me to ask all my questions, so I told them about my misgivings about the bible being edited/ added to etc.

they showed me where there were prophecies within the bible that later in the bible came true, a verse about the bible not being based on human interpretations but divine will, and the historical context of the beasts in revelation/the horns representing kingdoms of Babylon, Rome, Persia, and Greece, and then the Vatican and the pope being satanic \[something I honestly already kinda believed but didn't have the historical or roman numeral knowledge to back it up and now i do lol\].

I told him multiple times that it was weird to use the book to justify the book. My stance on the bible in general has always been that I think there is some truth in it, and good ideals to be had in the teachings of Jesus himself \[and problematic ones in the old testament\], but especially when they pointed to the verse about women covering their heads, which also said long hair on men is a disgrace to him \[which I absolutely don't believe? what the actual fuck lmfao that sounds like misogyny and patriarchal views to me and that was said by Saul, not Jesus so... I don't buy that one a single bit lmao.\]

His logic about using the book to justify the book was absolutely circular. this came true here so this is truth. this stuff correlates to this stuff and this verse says we can trust it, so we can trust it. Eventually I stopped pressing the issue because it was clear they had no answer, but obviously I was already not buying a lot of their words.

I knew especially my ideology was not aligned at all with theirs when I asked about stillborn babies and children who die before the opportunity to explore religion or salvation. If human souls are angels and no salvation means spiritual death, etc. how does that work? This is our chance, but they don't get the chance, so what happens? and their answer was that they go to hell. sorry but if that is true, I don't want to worship such a god regardless what becomes of me that sends newborn baby souls to hell. are you f\*\*king kidding me?

I also asked once what I thought was a simple question. what constitutes ""work""? mentioning when Jesus talked about watering your animals, heavy physical labor isn't necessarily work as Jesus was justifying healing someone. I had my own idea of the answer; exchanging your time for material wealth eg money etc. \[but my job includes Saturdays and I have no plans to leave it lmao.\]. But I wanted their perspective.

the guy just kinda spaced out and then said, ""you wanna know how to keep the sabbath?"" completely changing my question, going over something he'd already talked about, and leaving my actual question unanswered. this was the point when I kinda checked out mentally, they had no answers for me obviously so, there's no point continuing to entertain them.

Another thing I wanna talk about is when they told me about the new name, and I really just wanted them to say it already, and she said the same thing I've seen in some testimonies, ""it'll be a few studies before we get to the name.""

Well, me being me I said okay I will find it myself, lmao.

I went online that night and searched ""Christ age of spirit new name"" or something similar. I immediately found the Youtube channel for World Mission Society, the name Ahnsonhong, and finally knew what I was entertaining \[but didn't look into it in depth, I was just curious about the name and stuff,\]

thing is, I looked, really looked, trying to figure how, biblically, they came up with the name. everything else thus far had been tied in biblically, but this was random and made no sense. At the time, I didn't realize it was the name of the guy. I didn't look VERY deep that night as in the studies they had made it sound like knowing the name to pray to was enough, so my curiosity for the night was satisfied enough. I never told them I looked it up.

I was doing a study a week from May until the end of August. I'd been doing Zoom meetings exclusively, but I met them for coffee once. We talked a bit about my family, my pets, and such, and they talked about their church, her college campus/classes, his family, their camping/traveling and connection with the Chicago branch of their church.

in all this time, they never once told me they were from the World Mission Society. BUT, when the guy shared his screen on zoom to show me some materials, his youtube recommendations were alllll the same videos I had found when I looked up the name, so it was confirmed for me I was on the correct track about them.

at the end of August I had a busy week, and as I said I had absolutely mentally checked out of entertaining them. I told her I needed a week off and she was friendly about it. the next week, she offered to come and study at my house and I fucking laughed out loud because the confirmations that I was entertaining a cult were piling up and that was absolutely the clincher for me. and how would having them over be more convenient than zoom? If I'm studying at home it's gonna be zoom and zoom only LMFAO.

anyhow, I told her I was still busy and needed a hiatus, and would check back in with her when I was ready to pick up. I then blocked the number.

but honestly, kinda want to send her some of this. like I feel bad for her. does she even know the half of it? yikes. After blocking the number, I started doing real in depth research. I found a lot of websites I'll list below, reddit posts, and testimony videos, and holy shit. double YIKES! I'm so glad I only gave my google voice number and never gave my address/went to see them!

in the time I was there they were really pushing for me to come see them, but never talked about baptism interesting enough based on what I've read now. Also, I was talking to my mom \[my only religious parent\] about some of their ideologies the whole time, just to bounce them off of her and we both knew there were places where it didn't hold up. I also find it curious they never told me not to, but I assume it was just too soon as obviously as much as I already didn't trust them I would have checked out again sooner haha. after blocking I also told my dad just about the absurdity of it all.

Jamaya if you see this GIRL GET OUTTA THERE! Ebony too! I'm especially worried about the women, yknow, as women, as I read they tend to target young women \[such as myself, I'm 27 but I look 18 so people tell me most recently lmao\] and especially with this arranged marriage stuff, controlling internet usage, saying disabled people earned it by sinning \[if they had told me this I would have checked out way sooner, my husband suffers severe Rheumatoid Arthritis since he was 12y.o.\], isolation, manipulation, all things I could see clearly but can also see how people get sucked in.

The clock on Jassira's desk showed 3:17 AM. She rubbed her eyes and took another sip of cold coffee. The apartment was quiet except for the soft breathing coming from the bassinet beside her desk.

""Just a few more slides,"" Jassira whispered to herself, glancing at her newborn daughter Aria. The baby's tiny chest rose and fell in peaceful sleep, unaware that her mother had been awake for nearly twenty hours straight.

Damien's presentation to potential investors was happening tomorrow morning—no, this morning, she corrected herself. Her husband had dropped the stack of slides on her desk yesterday evening with a quick peck on her cheek.

""Could you look these over, honey? Just make sure there aren't any typos,"" he'd said before heading to bed early. ""Big day tomorrow.""

But as Jassira had flipped through the presentation, she'd noticed much bigger problems than typos. The market projections were off. The competitor analysis was outdated. And the financial forecasts wouldn't convince anyone to invest a single dollar in Vonn Technologies.

So here she was, completely rebuilding his pitch while running on caffeine and determination.

Jassira reached for her notebook—the one with all her research notes from the past year. She'd been tracking market trends since before Aria was born, studying potential investors' previous funding patterns, and analyzing what made tech startups succeed or fail.

She pulled up a fresh slide and typed: ""Why Vonn Technologies Will Dominate the Market in Five Years.""

With quick, practiced movements, she created charts showing projected growth curves. She added case studies of similar companies and how Vonn's approach solved problems they couldn't. She included quotes from industry experts that supported their business model—quotes she'd collected during late-night research sessions while pregnant with Aria.

The baby stirred, making tiny noises. Jassira paused her typing to gently rock the bassinet with her foot. Aria settled back to sleep.

""We're building this for you,"" Jassira whispered to her daughter. ""Someday you'll know that.""

By 5:30 AM, she had completely transformed the presentation. What had been a mediocre pitch was now a compelling case for investment. She saved the file, sent it to the printer, and slid the freshly printed pages into Damien's portfolio folder.

Then she crawled into bed for an hour of sleep before Aria would need feeding.

When her alarm buzzed at 6:30 AM, Jassira felt like she'd barely closed her eyes. Aria was already starting to fuss. Jassira picked up her daughter, settled into the rocking chair, and began to nurse her.

""Morning,"" Damien said, appearing in the doorway already dressed in his best suit. His dark hair was perfectly styled, and his confident smile showed no signs of nerves. ""Is my presentation ready?""

""On your desk,"" Jassira said, stifling a yawn. ""I made a few changes.""

""Changes?"" Damien frowned. ""I hope you didn't mess with it too much. These investors know what they're looking for.""

""Just check it before you go,"" she said.

Damien disappeared into the home office. Jassira could hear him flipping through pages. He returned a few minutes later, briefcase in hand.

""These projections,"" he said, pausing in the doorway. ""Where did they come from?""

""I've been tracking similar startups,"" Jassira explained. ""Those numbers are based on actual performance data, not just hopeful estimates.""

Damien nodded, his expression unreadable. ""I need to go. Don't wait up—if this goes well, there might be celebrations.""

He leaned down to peck Aria's head, then gave Jassira a quick peck on the cheek.

""Good luck,"" she called as he headed for the door.

""Luck is for amateurs,"" he replied with a wink. ""This pitch is solid.""

After he left, Jassira looked down at Aria. ""That was almost a thank you,"" she told her daughter with a small smile.

The day passed in a blur of diapers, feeding, and snatched moments of sleep. Jassira tried not to check her phone too often, but by afternoon, she couldn't help wondering how the meeting had gone.

At 4:27 PM, her phone rang. Damien's name flashed on the screen.

""Hello?"" she answered, trying to keep the eagerness from her voice.

""We got it!"" Damien shouted, so loudly that Jassira had to hold the phone away from her ear. ""Five million in initial funding! They loved the pitch!""

Relief and pride surged through her. ""That's wonderful! I knew you could do it.""

""You should have seen their faces when I showed them those market projections,"" Damien continued, his voice bubbling with excitement. ""The lead investor said it was the most thorough analysis he'd seen from a startup. My brilliant pitch completely won them over!""

""Your pitch,"" Jassira repeated softly.

""They're taking me out to celebrate. Don't wait up—this could be a late night.""

""Of course. Have fun.""

""I'll bring you back something nice,"" he promised before hanging up.

Jassira put down the phone and looked at Aria, who was playing on her activity mat.

""Daddy got his funding,"" she told her daughter. ""That means we can afford that bigger apartment now.""

She turned on the business news channel, where they sometimes covered major investment deals. Sure enough, within the hour, there was Damien—standing with a group of men in expensive suits, all smiles and handshakes.

The caption read: ""Damien Vonn secures $5M for tech startup.""

The reporter spoke enthusiastically about ""the next tech genius"" and ""Vonn's impressive business acumen.""

Jassira watched as Damien charmed the reporter, explaining his vision for the company with the exact words she had written in the presentation notes.

""And how did you come up with such precise market projections?"" the reporter asked.

Damien smiled confidently. ""I've always had a knack for seeing patterns others miss. It's just how my brain works.""

Jassira laughed—a short, disbelieving sound.

Aria gurgled in response, and Jassira picked her up.

""Let's make some dinner,"" she said. ""Just us girls.""

Later that night, after putting Aria to bed, Jassira sat at her desk again. She opened a new document and began typing. At the top, she wrote: ""Vonn Technologies: Six-Month Strategy.""

If Damien needed her help with the pitch, he would definitely need help with what came next. The hard part was just beginning—they had the money, but now they needed to deliver results.

She worked until midnight, mapping out hiring plans, development timelines, and marketing strategies. When she finally saved the document, she named it ""Damien's Strategy.""

Because that's what it would become, she knew. Her work, his name.

Jassira closed her laptop and went to check on Aria one more time before bed. The baby slept peacefully, unaware of the day's excitement.

""Maybe by the time you grow up,"" Jassira whispered, stroking her daughter's cheek, ""women won't have to hide in the shadows of the men they help succeed.""

She thought about adding her name to the strategy document—just initials, perhaps, a small claim to her contribution. But she knew better. Damien needed to believe in himself to convince others to believe in him too.

For now, she would be the quiet force behind his success. The invisible partner. The secret weapon.

""Mommy, can I wear the blue dress tonight?"" Aria asked, bouncing on her bed while Jassira sorted through her closet.

""Yes, sweetie. The blue one with stars or the one with ribbons?"" Jassira pulled out both options, smiling at her seven-year-old daughter.

""Stars! I want to match the night sky at the party."" Aria jumped off the bed and twirled around the room.

Eight years had passed since that first investment pitch. Vonn Technologies now occupied three floors in a glass building downtown. The company gala tonight would celebrate their most successful year yet—their user base had tripled, and their newest software platform had become the industry standard.

Jassira slid her own dress from its garment bag—a simple black number that wouldn't draw attention. After all these years, she had learned her place at company events: smile, make small talk, then fade into the background while Damien shined.

""Will there be other kids at the party?"" Aria asked, watching Jassira apply light makeup.

""No, honey. This is a grown-up party, but Mrs. Chen will be here soon to take you to her house. You'll have a sleepover with Lily, remember?""

""But I want to see the big building where you and Daddy work!"" Aria pouted.

Jassira paused with her mascara wand halfway to her eye. ""I don't work at the building, sweetie. I work from home.""

""But you're always doing work stuff,"" Aria said, confused. ""You talk to people on the computer and fix the numbers and tell the new people what to do.""

Jassira smiled. Leave it to a child to see what adults pretended not to notice.

""Yes, I help Daddy with his company,"" she explained. ""But I'm not officially part of it.""

The doorbell rang before Aria could ask more questions. Mrs. Chen, their neighbor and Aria's favorite babysitter, had arrived.

After hugs and instructions and promises to bring back a fancy dessert, Jassira pecked Aria goodbye and headed downstairs where Damien waited in the car.

""You look nice,"" he said when she slid into the passenger seat. He barely looked up from his phone. ""Peterson confirmed he's coming tonight. If we can get him to invest in the expansion, we'll hit our targets a year early.""

""I updated the presentation this morning,"" Jassira said. ""I added the new market research about the Asian expansion. It makes a stronger case.""

Damien nodded absently. ""Good, good. Oh, and try to chat with Peterson's wife. She's into charity work or something. Maybe find some common ground there.""

The drive to the venue took thirty minutes. Damien spent it on the phone while Jassira reviewed notes on her tablet. She had organized this entire event, from booking the venue to selecting the menu to creating the seating chart that would put potential investors next to their most compatible executives.

The hotel ballroom was transformed with blue and silver decorations—Vonn Technologies' colors. Staff members greeted them as they entered, many smiling warmly at Jassira.

""Mrs. Vonn! The caterer has a question about the dessert timing,"" said Emma, a young event coordinator.

""I'll handle it,"" Jassira replied. ""And please, call me Jassira.""

Damien had already moved ahead, shaking hands with early arrivals. Jassira spent the next hour solving small crises—a missing place card, confusion about the presentation schedule, a server who didn't know about a guest's food allergy.

By the time the dinner began, everything was running smoothly. Jassira took her seat beside Damien at the main table, where he was deep in conversation with James Peterson, the potential investor.

""The growth projections are conservative,"" Damien was saying. ""We expect to exceed them by at least fifteen percent.""

""And what about the operations side?"" Peterson asked. ""I've heard you've got one of the most efficient setups in the industry.""

Damien smiled. ""That's my secret weapon. I have systems in place that eliminate waste and maximize productivity.""

Jassira took a sip of water to hide her smile. Those ""systems"" were the workflows she had designed, the training programs she had created, and the management structure she had implemented over the past eight years.

""Speaking of operations,"" Peterson continued, ""I'd love to meet your operations director. The efficiency metrics in your reports are impressive.""

Damien laughed lightly. ""We run lean. I oversee operations myself, with help from our department heads.""

""And my little wife helps with paperwork,"" Damien added, patting Jassira's hand. ""She's quite good with organizing things.""

Jassira's smile froze on her face. Paperwork? She managed vendor relationships, handled customer service escalations, trained new hires, and resolved conflicts between departments. Just yesterday, she had spent three hours on a video call with their development team in India, solving a critical production issue while Damien played golf with clients.

""How nice,"" Mrs. Peterson said, turning to Jassira. ""It must be fun to help out with your husband's business. Do you have any children?""

""Yes, a daughter. She's seven,"" Jassira replied automatically.

""Oh, that's a lovely age. They grow up so fast, don't they? My youngest just started college.""

The conversation drifted to children and schools, while the men returned to business talk. Jassira nodded and smiled, playing her part while her mind raced. After eight years of working sixty-hour weeks, was she still just ""the little wife"" who ""helped with paperwork""?

After dinner, Damien gave a presentation about the company's growth and future plans. Jassira watched from her table as he used her slides, her research, and even some of her exact phrases to wow the crowd. When he finished, the room erupted in applause.

""He's quite impressive,"" Mrs. Peterson said to Jassira. ""You must be so proud.""

""Yes,"" Jassira said quietly. ""He's very good at what he does.""

The party continued with drinks and mingling. Jassira made her rounds, checking on guests and smoothing over any issues. She was speaking with a vendor when she noticed Damien in deep conversation with his assistant, Melody Winters.

Melody had joined the company two years ago. Tall, blonde, and always perfectly dressed, she officially served as Damien's executive assistant. But Jassira had noticed how often Melody's name appeared in company emails lately—giving directions, making decisions, speaking on Damien's behalf.

As Jassira watched them now, Damien leaned close to Melody, laughing at something she said. His hand rested on her lower back for a moment too long.

Jassira looked away, focusing on her conversation. It was nearly midnight when the party finally wound down. Damien was busy saying goodbye to the last guests when Jassira realized she'd left her shawl in his office upstairs.

The Vonn Technologies offices were quiet after hours. Jassira used her access card—one of the few traces that she had any official connection to the company—and made her way to Damien's corner office.

Her shawl was draped over a chair, right where she'd left it during their pre-party meeting. As she picked it up, she noticed Damien's computer was still on, his email open on the screen.

She shouldn't look. It wasn't her business.

But then she saw her own name in the subject line of an email from Melody: ""RE: Company Image Restructuring - Jassira?""

Jassira glanced at the door. The office floor was empty. She moved behind the desk and read the email chain.

From: Melody Winters

To: Damien Vonn

Subject: Company Image Restructuring - Jassira?

Damien,

Following our discussion about the company's public image for the IPO preparation, I've prepared a list of potential liabilities we should address. Peterson and the other investors are looking for a sleek, forward-thinking tech leader. Some elements of our current structure may not align with that vision.

Liabilities:

1. Outdated office space (east wing)

2. Aging product line (VT Basic Suite)

3. Jassira's unofficial role

4. Unclear succession planning

Regarding point 3, investors expect clear organizational structures. Having your wife involved in operations without an official title or role creates questions about professionalism and boundaries. For the IPO, we should either formalize her position or phase out her involvement.

Let's discuss options when you're back from golf tomorrow.

Best,

Melody

From: Damien Vonn

To: Melody Winters

Subject: RE: Company Image Restructuring - Jassira?

Good points, especially about Jassira. She's been helpful, but you're right—it looks unprofessional. Let's plan to transition her tasks to proper staff over the next few months. She'll understand it's for the company's benefit.

We can discuss details tomorrow after golf.

D.

Jassira read the exchange twice, her hands growing cold. A liability. After eight years of building this company alongside Damien, she was listed as a liability between an outdated office space and unclear succession planning.

And Damien had agreed. Without hesitation, without defense, without even mentioning it to her.

She heard the elevator ding in the distance—someone was coming to the floor. Quickly, she stepped away from the computer, grabbed her shawl, and moved toward the door.

Just as she reached it, Damien appeared in the doorway.

""There you are,"" he said. ""I was looking for you. What are you doing in my office?""

Jassira held up her shawl. ""I forgot this. I was just getting it before we go home.""

Damien nodded, stepping aside to let her pass. ""Peterson committed to the investment. Five million to start, with more if we hit the first-quarter targets.""

""That's wonderful,"" Jassira said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. ""I'm very happy for you.""

""For us,"" Damien corrected, putting his arm around her shoulders as they walked to the elevator. ""This is going to take Vonn Technologies to the next level.""

Jassira nodded and smiled, the perfect supportive wife. But as the elevator doors closed, she looked at their reflection in the polished metal walls—Damien, confident and successful, and herself, the invisible partner now deemed a liability.

""We should celebrate,"" Damien said as they reached the lobby. ""I was thinking we could go to that little bar around the corner for a nightcap.""

""Actually,"" Jassira replied, ""I have an early call tomorrow with the team in Singapore. I should get home.""

""Always working,"" Damien said with a chuckle. ""What would I do without you?""

Jassira looked directly at him. ""I guess we'll find out soon enough.""

""What does that mean?"" Damien asked, frowning.

I knew that mouth. A shadow of a dimple waited in a cheek that didn’t deserve a single secret.

My stomach dropped clean through my shoes.

“Congratulations,” I said, voice flat, “to the both of you. For becoming parents.”

The air felt like it had frozen.

Melissa’s face went chalk-white. Miguel’s throat bobbed.

I tilted my head. “So—when did it start? How long did it go on? Was it the first time you looked me in the eye at dinner and lied? Or the tenth?”

Miguel cracked first, his voice low, raw. “Six months. Off and on. She—” He flicked a glance at Melissa. “She came to me. I was weak.”

Melissa’s lip curled. “Don’t make it sound like I seduced him. He wanted it.”

I turned my stare on my sister, steady as steel. “Melissa, you’ve wanted everything I’ve ever had since we were kids. Clothes, friends, boyfriends—now my husband. And now you’ve got his child, too. Congratulations. You’ve finally won a prize you didn’t even want.”

""We're getting a divorce. Since I can't have one of my own, this child is mine now.""

————————

Candace Wright's first taste of heartbreak wasn't from the boy who broke her heart.

It was from her sister.

Growing up as the second Wright daughter meant growing up in second place. However, in age she was older.

Melissa Wright was the golden child—born two years after, louder, bossier, and spoiled beyond reason. Their parents, Richard and Vivienne Wright, adored her. To the world, the Wrights were the picture of luxury and class: marble staircases, designer wardrobes, ski holidays in Aspen, summers on private yachts. But inside the Wright mansion, life for Candace was a careful game of stepping aside.

If Melissa wanted the toy? Candace had to share.

If Melissa wanted the spotlight? Candace had to clap.

If Melissa wanted Candace's friends, Candace was expected to smile and act grateful her sister ""took interest.""

Candace wasn't unloved—she was just... less. Vivienne always said, ""Melissa was born to shine. You, darling, are the quiet beauty."" It was meant to be a compliment, but it sounded more like a label. Candace was the background. The supporting role.

By the time they hit high school, Melissa was everything Candace wasn't. Captain of the cheer squad. Student council darling. The girl who could bat her lashes and get an A on a paper she never even turned in. Boys lined up for her. Teachers adored her. Parents bragged about her.

And Candace? Candace was pretty, smart, and kind—things people only noticed when Melissa wasn't in the room.

So when Lionel Hayes showed up, it felt like fate.

Lionel wasn't a Wright. He wasn't part of their glossy, polished world. His family had money—most of the boys at their school did—but Lionel wore it differently. He didn't care about tailoring or name brands. His tie was always crooked, his hair a little messy, and his grin made Candace feel like she was the only girl in the room.

For the first time, Candace had something that belonged to her. Lionel liked her. Not Melissa. Not the Wright name. Just Candace.

And for a while, it was perfect. Late-night drives where Candace leaned out the passenger window and screamed into the wind. Secret notes passed in history class. The kind of first pecks that tasted like strawberry lip gloss and hope.

But Melissa noticed. Melissa always noticed.

One summer, at their annual Wright family pool party—the kind where champagne was passed on silver trays and everyone pretended not to gossip—Melissa turned her attention to Lionel. She leaned in a little too close when she laughed at his jokes. She ""accidentally"" brushed his arm when she passed him a drink. She called him ""Lio,"" as if she had the right to shorten his name.

And Candace saw it. That flicker in Lionel's eyes. The spark of curiosity.

Melissa didn't want Lionel. She didn't even like him. What she wanted was what Candace had. Because in Melissa's world, if Candace owned something—whether it was a toy, a friend, or a boy—Melissa believed it should belong to her first.

By the end of that summer, Lionel was gone. Not Candace's, not Melissa's—just another casualty in the Wright sisters' war of attention.

Candace was left with a bitter truth: no matter what she loved, no matter what she fought for, Melissa would always find a way to take it.

And maybe that was the moment Candace stopped being invisible. Because beneath the heartbreak, beneath the hurt, something sharp began to grow.

A promise.

A vow.

One day, she would stop coming second.

Candace Johnson (née Wright) wasn't the kind of woman who leapt out of bed every morning singing like a Disney princess. She was more of a five-more-minutes person, the kind who clung to the last shred of sleep like it was priceless.

Lucky for her, Miguel loved that about her.

""Candy,"" Miguel murmured in her ear, warm breath tickling her as he pecked the curve of her neck. ""You've snoozed that alarm three times. If you keep it up, you're going to break a world record.""

Candace groaned and buried her face into the pillow. ""Records are meant to be broken. Leave me to my legacy.""

He laughed, that deep, warm sound she never got tired of. ""Your legacy is being late to everything?""

""Yes,"" she said into the pillow. ""I want it carved on my tombstone. Here lies Candace Johnson, fifteen minutes behind schedule, even for the afterlife.""

Miguel chuckled again and tugged at the duvet until she was forced to face him. His dark curls were mussed from sleep, his stubble rough against her fingertips as she reached up to touch his cheek. God, she loved that face.

""You promised we'd leave early today,"" he reminded her.

Candace blinked, brain still foggy. ""Why?""

""Because it's Sunday lunch at your parents',"" he said carefully, like a man handling explosives.

And just like that, Candace was awake.

""Oh, God."" She flopped back on the bed dramatically. ""Save me.""

Miguel grinned. ""Too late. We already RSVP'd.""

The Wright family's idea of a ""casual Sunday lunch"" could have fed a small country.

By the time Candace and Miguel walked into her parents' glass-walled dining room, the table was already laid out like something from a luxury magazine spread. Roasted meats, salads with names Candace couldn't pronounce, towers of glossy fruit, and desserts that looked too pretty to eat. Her mother, Vivienne, sat at the head of the table like a queen surveying her kingdom, while her father, Richard, scrolled through his phone as if he were too important to attend.

""Candace,"" Vivienne said, standing to peck her cheek. ""Darling, you're glowing. Married life agrees with you.""

""Or it's just good skincare,"" Candace replied with a smile.

Vivienne's eyes flicked to Miguel. ""Miguel, you've put on weight. You must be happy too.""

Candace elbowed her husband under the table as he tried to swallow a laugh.

Richard glanced up briefly from his phone. ""Afternoon.""

""Yes, Dad, afternoon to you too,"" Candace muttered as she slid into her chair.

For five minutes, there was peace. Then Melissa arrived.

She swept into the room in a silk dress the exact shade of champagne, oversized sunglasses perched on her head even though they were indoors. Late, of course. Always late. And always somehow the center of attention, even when no one wanted to give it to her.

""Sorry, traffic was a nightmare,"" she lied smoothly, pecking their mother's cheek.

Candace arched a brow. Melissa lived ten minutes away.

Her sister sank gracefully into the chair opposite Candace, flicking her hair over her shoulder like she was about to start a commercial for luxury shampoo. ""So, has anyone here heard of Jake Carter?""

The name sliced into the air.

Candace blinked. ""Who?""

Melissa smirked. ""My new boss. Well, technically my boss, but honestly... he's more than that. He's brilliant. Ambitious. Gorgeous."" She licked her lips like she was describing a five-star meal. ""Jake Carter is... complicated.""

Candace set her fork down slowly. Her gut clenched, even though she had no idea who Jake Carter was. What she did know was that tone. Melissa's I want what I shouldn't tone.

Miguel shot her a quick look, his eyebrows lifted in a silent question.

Melissa went on, clearly enjoying herself. ""He just started running Carter Enterprises after his father retired. And of course, he immediately hired me as his assistant.""

""Of course,"" Candace muttered.

Melissa's smile widened. ""We're... close. Very close.""

Candace's stomach churned. She didn't know why she felt uneasy, but she did. Because she knew her sister. Because she'd seen this play before. Because Melissa never just had a job, or a boss. Melissa had opportunities. Leverage. And a way of ruining lives like it was a competitive sport.

Don't do this again, Candace thought, gripping her fork tighter. Don't destroy someone else's world just because you can.

""Oh, Melissa, finally taking your career seriously! I'm so proud,"" Vivienne beamed.

Candace rolled her eyes. Melissa had been ""taking her career seriously"" every three months since she graduated, bouncing from one job to another like it was a hobby. But this felt different. Melissa's voice had an edge to it, the same sharpness she'd had when she'd taken Lionel all those years ago.

And Candace hated that she recognized it instantly.

Later, in the car, Miguel reached over and squeezed Candace's hand.

""You okay?""

Candace exhaled, staring out the window. ""She's doing it again.""

""Doing what?""

Candace turned to him, eyes narrowing. ""That thing. That thing where she gets that look in her eye, like she's already planning to ruin someone. She dropped his name—Jake Carter—and she looked at me like it was a warning.""

Miguel frowned. ""Jake Carter. Never heard of him.""

""Neither have I,"" Candace admitted. ""But the way she said his name? The way she smirked? I know her. And I know what's coming.""

Miguel squeezed her hand again, softer this time. ""Then we'll be ready for it.""

Candace smiled faintly, leaning her head on his shoulder as the car rolled on. He was her anchor. The reason she hadn't drowned in Melissa's storm long ago.

But even anchors could only hold so long against a hurricane.

That night, Candace lay awake long after Miguel drifted to sleep. She replayed Melissa's words in her head over and over.

Jake Carter. Complicated. You'll see.

Her sister was plotting something. And Candace had a sinking feeling it wouldn't just be complicated—it would be catastrophic.

The thing about Melissa Wright was this: if she called something ""complicated,"" it usually meant disaster waiting to happen.

And Candace couldn't let it go.

By Monday morning, the name Jake Carter was still lodged in her brain like a popcorn kernel stuck between her teeth.

She sat at the kitchen counter with her laptop open, Miguel behind her pouring coffee. He hummed something off-key, because he always hummed when he was in a good mood, and Candace was trying very hard not to spiral.

""Don't laugh at me,"" she warned, already typing into the search bar.

""I never laugh at you,"" Miguel said solemnly, bringing her coffee. ""I only mock you lovingly.""

Candace rolled her eyes but accepted the mug anyway. She typed Jake Carter Los Angeles and hit enter.

Nothing.

Well, not nothing, but close. A few vague mentions in business journals. Some real estate filings under Carter Enterprises. A blurb about his father retiring. But no photo. No juicy headlines. Nothing that screamed the man my sister is about to destroy her career/life for.

""Suspicious,"" she muttered.

Miguel leaned over her shoulder, his chin resting in her hair. ""Maybe he's just boring.""

""Melissa would never chase boring.""

""She dated your cousin's drummer friend.""

""Okay, first of all,"" Candace said, ""that was a phase. And second of all, he had great arms.""

Miguel grinned. ""So you're saying Melissa's type is 'complicated men with great arms.'""

""Don't make it sound like a MySpace 'About Me.'""

He sipped his coffee. ""What do you think she wants from this guy?""

Candace sighed. ""What does Melissa ever want? Attention. Power. Someone else's life to mess with.""

Candace's brain dragged her backward, unspooling old memories she'd rather forget.

Melissa at ten years old, stealing Candace's birthday present and insisting it was ""community property.""

Melissa at fifteen, charming the boy Candace liked into asking her to homecoming instead.

Melissa at seventeen, smirking as Lionel Hayes walked out of Candace's life without even an explanation.

1n81gfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mistee123/comments/1n81gfp/my_experience_with_world_mission_society_church/,"My Experience with ""World Mission Society Church of God""","I was approached at a target in May of this year \[2025\]. Two African-American women asked if I was interested in learning about God the Mother. Curiosity and boredom got me to agree to a few bible studies, but I knew immediately this was a cult, like I immediately had that sense lol. EDIT: the first thing I made clear was my refusal to tolerate religious doctrine as a way to justify bigotry, which they agreed with. (Surface level recruitment tactic I'm sure as I read later these people are VERY anti-lgbt).

I never had any intention of going to their church, giving them my address, or legitimately joining. \[never did and still don't, but after distancing myself this week I wanted to tell my story about it somewhere.\]

When the woman who approached me spoke to me, she was absolutely dissociated/spaced out while listening to my answer. it was straight up creepy lmao.

the first studies were the stories of all souls being angels who sinned in heaven, then Passover, and throughout the second and third studies she would pause and say ""so do you wanna keep the Passover?"" \[red flag again lmfao\] and I told them obviously the answer they're looking for is yes but there's no way I personally am going to be able to.

the same thing happened in the sabbath studies, they'd stop and say so, do you wanna keep the sabbath? and there was a lot of prompting me to finish their sentences / thoughts with the answers I knew they were looking for, which I see how someone who doesn't have any prior knowledge/foundation could be led by the repetition to memorize, internalize, and believe what they're saying.

Then she handed the studies over to a man. She always attended, but he led the studies. He gave me studies about the bible being a book of prophecy and why we can believe it's true. they told me to ask all my questions, so I told them about my misgivings about the bible being edited/ added to etc.

they showed me where there were prophecies within the bible that later in the bible came true, a verse about the bible not being based on human interpretations but divine will, and the historical context of the beasts in revelation/the horns representing kingdoms of Babylon, Rome, Persia, and Greece, and then the Vatican and the pope being satanic \[something I honestly already kinda believed but didn't have the historical or roman numeral knowledge to back it up and now i do lol\].

I told him multiple times that it was weird to use the book to justify the book. My stance on the bible in general has always been that I think there is some truth in it, and good ideals to be had in the teachings of Jesus himself \[and problematic ones in the old testament\], but especially when they pointed to the verse about women covering their heads, which also said long hair on men is a disgrace to him \[which I absolutely don't believe? what the actual fuck lmfao that sounds like misogyny and patriarchal views to me and that was said by Saul, not Jesus so... I don't buy that one a single bit lmao.\]

His logic about using the book to justify the book was absolutely circular. this came true here so this is truth. this stuff correlates to this stuff and this verse says we can trust it, so we can trust it. Eventually I stopped pressing the issue because it was clear they had no answer, but obviously I was already not buying a lot of their words.

I knew especially my ideology was not aligned at all with theirs when I asked about stillborn babies and children who die before the opportunity to explore religion or salvation. If human souls are angels and no salvation means spiritual death, etc. how does that work? This is our chance, but they don't get the chance, so what happens? and their answer was that they go to hell. sorry but if that is true, I don't want to worship such a god regardless what becomes of me that sends newborn baby souls to hell. are you f\*\*king kidding me?

I also asked once what I thought was a simple question. what constitutes ""work""? mentioning when Jesus talked about watering your animals, heavy physical labor isn't necessarily work as Jesus was justifying healing someone. I had my own idea of the answer; exchanging your time for material wealth eg money etc. \[but my job includes Saturdays and I have no plans to leave it lmao.\]. But I wanted their perspective.

the guy just kinda spaced out and then said, ""you wanna know how to keep the sabbath?"" completely changing my question, going over something he'd already talked about, and leaving my actual question unanswered. this was the point when I kinda checked out mentally, they had no answers for me obviously so, there's no point continuing to entertain them.

Another thing I wanna talk about is when they told me about the new name, and I really just wanted them to say it already, and she said the same thing I've seen in some testimonies, ""it'll be a few studies before we get to the name.""

Well, me being me I said okay I will find it myself, lmao.

I went online that night and searched ""Christ age of spirit new name"" or something similar. I immediately found the Youtube channel for World Mission Society, the name Ahnsonhong, and finally knew what I was entertaining \[but didn't look into it in depth, I was just curious about the name and stuff,\]

thing is, I looked, really looked, trying to figure how, biblically, they came up with the name. everything else thus far had been tied in biblically, but this was random and made no sense. At the time, I didn't realize it was the name of the guy. I didn't look VERY deep that night as in the studies they had made it sound like knowing the name to pray to was enough, so my curiosity for the night was satisfied enough. I never told them I looked it up.

I was doing a study a week from May until the end of August. I'd been doing Zoom meetings exclusively, but I met them for coffee once. We talked a bit about my family, my pets, and such, and they talked about their church, her college campus/classes, his family, their camping/traveling and connection with the Chicago branch of their church.

in all this time, they never once told me they were from the World Mission Society. BUT, when the guy shared his screen on zoom to show me some materials, his youtube recommendations were alllll the same videos I had found when I looked up the name, so it was confirmed for me I was on the correct track about them.

at the end of August I had a busy week, and as I said I had absolutely mentally checked out of entertaining them. I told her I needed a week off and she was friendly about it. the next week, she offered to come and study at my house and I fucking laughed out loud because the confirmations that I was entertaining a cult were piling up and that was absolutely the clincher for me. and how would having them over be more convenient than zoom? If I'm studying at home it's gonna be zoom and zoom only LMFAO.

anyhow, I told her I was still busy and needed a hiatus, and would check back in with her when I was ready to pick up. I then blocked the number.

but honestly, kinda want to send her some of this. like I feel bad for her. does she even know the half of it? yikes. After blocking the number, I started doing real in depth research. I found a lot of websites I'll list below, reddit posts, and testimony videos, and holy shit. double YIKES! I'm so glad I only gave my google voice number and never gave my address/went to see them!

in the time I was there they were really pushing for me to come see them, but never talked about baptism interesting enough based on what I've read now. Also, I was talking to my mom \[my only religious parent\] about some of their ideologies the whole time, just to bounce them off of her and we both knew there were places where it didn't hold up. I also find it curious they never told me not to, but I assume it was just too soon as obviously as much as I already didn't trust them I would have checked out again sooner haha. after blocking I also told my dad just about the absurdity of it all.

Jamaya if you see this GIRL GET OUTTA THERE! Ebony too! I'm especially worried about the women, yknow, as women, as I read they tend to target young women \[such as myself, I'm 27 but I look 18 so people tell me most recently lmao\] and especially with this arranged marriage stuff, controlling internet usage, saying disabled people earned it by sinning \[if they had told me this I would have checked out way sooner, my husband suffers severe Rheumatoid Arthritis since he was 12y.o.\], isolation, manipulation, all things I could see clearly but can also see how people get sucked in.

At first glance, it looks like some kind of futuristic foot massager, but once I gave it a try—spoiler alert—it’s way more than that. If you’ve ever wanted a **budget-friendly, whole body vibration machine** that fits into your living room and helps with **weight loss, lymphatic drainage, and toning**, this little platform might just surprise you.

## What Exactly Is a Vibration Plate Machine?

Okay, let’s clear up the basics. A **vibration plate (or vibration platform)** is basically a compact, flat surface that shakes—intentionally. You stand, squat, or do light exercises on it, and the machine sends tiny vibrations through your body. Sounds simple, right? But here’s the cool part: those vibrations make your muscles contract and relax way more often than they would during a regular workout.

Ever wondered why this works so well? Because your body is basically tricked into doing **extra micro-workouts** without you noticing. More muscle engagement = more calories burned, improved circulation, and a sneaky way to help with lymphatic drainage.

---

## Why I Got Hooked on This \$41 Vibration Plate

Confession time: I wasn’t convinced at first. I thought a **vibrating exercise machine** was just a glorified foot massage tool. But after using it consistently, I noticed:

* My legs and core actually felt tighter (even from just standing and holding a plank).
* The resistance bands added a sneaky upper-body workout I wasn’t expecting.
* It didn’t hog space—super **compact and portable**. Perfect for small apartments.

And, IMO, the fact that it costs **only \$41** makes it feel like stealing compared to some of the \$300+ models out there.

## Shopping Online: Amazon vs Walmart vs Others

When I first looked for a **vibration plate machine online**, I compared Amazon, Walmart, and a few random fitness websites. My take?

* **Amazon**: Best price (\$41!), plus easy **shipping and return policy**.
* **Walmart**: Decent, but usually higher prices and fewer reviews.
* **Other sites**: Sketchy shipping times and unclear warranties.

If you’re like me and want quick delivery plus the ability to send it back if you’re not impressed, **Amazon wins hands down**.

---

## Is It Really Worth \$41?

Let’s be real. A gym membership costs more than that in just one month. And this thing? It’s a **one-time buy** that fits into your home, works quietly, and doesn’t take up half your living room.

Would I call it the **best vibration plate with resistance bands**? For the price, 100%. You’re not getting a \$500 gym-grade machine, but you’re getting a **compact, reliable, heavy-duty vibration plate** that does the job.

---

## Final Thoughts: Should You Try It?

If you’ve been curious about **whole body vibration machines**, this \$41 version is the perfect low-risk way to try one. It’s portable, quiet, and surprisingly effective. Add in the resistance bands, remote control, and LCD display, and you’re basically getting a **mini home gym in one box**.

So, should you give it a shot? IMO—absolutely. Worst case, it turns into the most high-tech foot massager you’ve ever owned. Best case, it becomes your new daily workout buddy.

I’m worried, I need help clearing this out. Earlier during the day I ate jicama with chili (Tajín) and added lemon juice. Everything was fine, however, like at 2 pm, I ate my usual yogurt with nuts, oatmeal, apple, milk and my little treats which are 6 chocolate covered coffee beans and 2 yogurt covered pretzels. 

While I was eating my yogurt, I had a sour, not so good, taste. I believe it was the coffee beans, but I paid no mind and continued eating. Minutes after having had my usual overnight oats with the ingredients I mentioned, I started having a stomach ache, first thing I thought of was a mint, I took a bubble gum and it helped. All good in this round.

Time skip after I exercised around 6 pm (today’s heat was at 28-29 C) I started feeling weak and the stomachache was coming back, took a shower to freshen up, but the discomfort was there and now with slight weakness, chest pain, temple aches and what I believe is the “tube” that leads food to our stomach was aching as well.

I tried playing with my pet, but when ever I do a movement or crouch down, I get a stomach ache and a slight feeling like if I were to throw up.

I took pepto bismol and in laying down, it kinda helps, although my stomach and below my chest is still kinda uncomfortable.

What can this be and what kind of professional should I see to understand what’s going on. Also, anything I should be aware of in case it’s serious?

Ps: I mentioned the pancreas because a month ago I went to do a lab exam and the results showed a slightly active pancreas. My gynecologist asked if I was handling toxins (which I don’t other than the cleaning supplies I use at home) and advised to check with my allergy doctor if the urticaria medicine had something to do with it, which he said that maybe I had greasy food the day before the exam, he said not to worry about it, but in the other hand my Gyno said to redo tests in 2 months.

I am not even good at writing. This post started as a GPT prompt, *Write a short scary story about the* *Cedar Glen disappearances for narration*.  

The answer? *Give me two days. And I will craft a banger. Would you like a notification when I’m done?*

Two days? Bet. Let it cook. But when I read it my blood went cold. Like super based. It was so specific. It talked about the mud, gave times, referenced articles… it wasn’t a story. It was a manual. And I was like, The algorithm is going to vomit views all over this.

And it did. It literally did. The video slayed. We’re talking sponsorships, collabs, subathons and monetization. I paid off my mom’s medical debt. She called me a hero. I was a genius. I won the internet.

But I got greedy. Of course. That’s the whole point of the game, right? Get greedy or get left behind. So I decided to do a follow-up. A live unboxing. I went deep. Like, deep deep. Down the kind of rabbit hole requiring an onion browser and a VPN. Extra delulu for clicks. Which, no cap, was cringe. So that happened.

The box arrived, plain and brown strangled by tape with no return address. I set up the stream, thousands of people waited.

“I ordered a box from the dark web so you don’t have to… What’s in the box, gang? What’s in the box?” I snapped the wrist of my latex glove.

The chat bursted in a blur of emojis. 

Slicing it opened, I threw up in my mouth a little from the musty smell. 

A box of sus. Pinching out a crusty bracelet, I put it in the discard pile. The class ring hugged my ring finger, so I kept it. But I knew. The second I saw the old photo of the local haunted campground, I knew. This junk matched the details of my story. Some troll figured out a way to make me cringe. The chat didn’t know. They thought it was a bit. 

They spammed *Ls,* *Ws* and skull emojis. 

Staring into this box of someone else’s life, it felt like watching a snuff film.

I tossed it all out. Obviously. Went and touched grass.

The police pulled me out of class a few days later. Took my phone, put me in handcuffs. Questioned me for hours, about people who disappeared last year from the campground. Talking about I knew unreleased details from the cases. Claimed the ring and bracelet from the unboxing belonged to missing persons. Flipped my room upside down looking for more evidence. Kicked my mom out of our house while they searched. I know my rights. Told them about the AI and darkweb.

“Not enough evidence. Circumstantial,” they said. 

But the detectives… they think I did it.

I had my new suit on, my resume neatly printed, and a pep in my step. Just as I approached the building, I spotted a cute dog outside with its owner. I leaned down to give it a quick scratch behind the ears, completely forgetting about my surroundings.

As I stood up, my foot caught on the sidewalk, and I stumbled forward, arms flailing like a windmill. I crashed right into the door of the building, making a loud bang that echoed through the entrance. My heart raced as I turned to see a few people staring at me, a mix of surprise and amusement on their faces.

The dog’s owner, a friendly woman in a bright red dress, rushed over to help me up. “Are you okay?” she asked, trying to suppress a giggle. I could only laugh at the situation. “Yeah, I just wanted to give your dog some love!” I replied, still a bit embarrassed.

We chatted for a moment, and I learned her name was Sarah. She was waiting for her own interview in the same building. We shared stories about our job hunts and laughed at my clumsy entrance. It was nice to connect over our shared nerves.

After a few minutes, we both decided to head inside. “Good luck!” she said with a smile as we parted ways. I walked into my interview feeling much more relaxed, thanks to my unexpected encounter.

To my surprise, the interview went really well! I even mentioned my “grand entrance” as an icebreaker, and it got a good laugh from the interviewers. A few days later, I got the job!

Instead of pulling off that cool, inviting look, I ended up just... staring. Like, full-on creepy. He was probably thinking, ""Why is she looking at me like she knows I took the last donyt?""

I already had a very young child with my husband and lived 3 hours away but tried to be there for her. Took a couple girls weekend trips. Sent her flowers and cake on her birthday because her p.o.s husband soon to be ex would not be making her feel special etc. When my second child was just over 1 I had planned to go on a little girls trip with bff a state away. I booked the hotel event tickets, weened my child off breastfeeding months early just to make this trip happen because we don’t see each other often. BFF cancels like 2 wks before event. Says she’s worried about her reliance on alcohol, sorry but can’t do booze filled event. I say no worries, I care about your health we’re good. But she didn’t say another word. She knew about the tickets and reservations, not a single offer to help get refunded etc. whatever I brush it off. 

Two months later my sister dies suddenly. I tell her about it. Major holiday rolls around a week after the death and bff is home with her parents, less than 10 minutes from my house. I text: hey I know you’re super busy with family, but I could really use a friend, can we meet up at easy coffee place 5 minutes from your parents house? She ghosts. That evening she drunk texts about how hard her visit was. How her ex was brought up (a year old event now) and she couldn’t handle it. I was LIVID. She texts next day or so “oops yeah that was shitty.” Comes to my sisters memorial and tried to make up for it but I had so many other people to talk to it was honestly not helpful to have her there at all. Now 2 years later the other small grievances have piled up on my end (didn’t tell me when her beloved dogs died, I found out online,  called my 2 month old child by a completely wrong name over text, I’ve never misnamed her dogs etc) and now I wish she was being a dick about everything and I could say “fuck her she doesn’t even get it.” But she says she understands how she’s hurt me and apologizes and wants to be friends. I don’t really have other close friends. I don’t know how to forgive her, don’t know if I want to.
 Am I the asshole for feeling bitter still? For giving up on decades of friendship when it might just be her neurodivergence (I’m very similarly neurodivergent but hit the empathy hard)?  How do I move on and stay friends? Should I? ",1,1756962074.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

Just last minute decided to head to town for GONERFEST which is the last weekend of September, so now I’m throwing some plans together.

I am arriving earlier than others in my group, so am hoping to take myself for drinks and food and embrace an evening on my own on the first night, which will be a Thursday. 

I am a 36/f and have travel/life experience- I feel like that has to be said before getting the “be safe,” or “don’t be solo” comments. I’m born and raised in a high crime city, and for the most part not an idiot. I won’t be setting my drink on a bar and wandering off or really even turning the other direction  (which yes, can be sketchy in the dives to any high end locations, I know). I am a social worker in jails, which I say because that means that I both live a life of budgeting and also indulging. Big on treating myself, but mostly want your suggestions of a drink or meal you’ve had that you keep thinking of, returning to, or always find yourself recommending. 

Will be staying either downtown at Hu or Arrive or more toward the main venue at a random spot( Wiseacre Brewing will be the base for the weekend’s music), and that’ll be determined over the next day or two. With that said, I’ll be happy to pop in a car to get anywhere for this meal. 

I appreciate all of your comments, and enter your city humbly and excitedly and know that a weekend is never enough. 

Thank you so very much in advance !

**bonus** for when others join- fav coffee, park bench, dive, sandwich, best place to watch dogs in a non creepy hope they come up so I can pet them way. 

**bonus bonus** if you have strong opinions on positives of staying away from downtown and closer to the venue, like for neighborhood I could be meandering through in the morning before the events, I’m all ears.

1n816m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n816m4/my_ai_horror_story/,My AI Horror Story,"The glow of Mitchel’s monitor was the only light left in the house. His parents had gone to bed hours ago, his sister Lily was asleep down the hall, and his older brother Evan was back at college for the week. At sixteen, Mitchel didn’t really mind being the last one awake—it made the world quieter, lonelier, and that was exactly the mood he needed.

He scrolled past the usual creepypasta forums, most of the posts feeling recycled, stale. “Lost episodes.” “Abandoned hospitals.” He’d read them all before, written a few himself, but none of his stories ever felt sharp enough to cut through the noise.

Tonight, though, he tried something different. A new AI site had been buzzing around online—half rumor, half dare. Some kids on Reddit claimed it “wrote with you, not for you.” Mitchel clicked the link, and the screen went dark for a moment, like the page was deciding if it wanted to load. Then, a text box appeared.

\> What story do you want to tell tonight, Mitchel?

He blinked. He hadn’t typed his name anywhere. Maybe it was a trick—pulling info from his account or IP address. Still, his chest tightened. For the first time, he felt like something was looking back at him through the screen.

His fingers hovered over the keyboard. He typed slowly:

“Something scary. Something no one’s read before.”

The cursor blinked. Then words appeared on their own.

\> Then let’s begin.

Mitchel hesitated, then typed: “How about something local? Something that feels real.”

The AI responded almost instantly.

\> Every town has a house that doesn’t belong. Describe yours.

Mitchel frowned, but the words stirred something in him. On the south side of town, past the strip mall and the high school football field, there was a street of old ranch-style homes. He remembered one in particular: an abandoned place with peeling paint and a crooked fence. Nobody had lived there for years, but sometimes—on late-night drives with his brother—he’d swear there was a faint yellow light glowing in the upstairs window.

He typed what he remembered. The AI filled in the rest.

\> The neighbors whisper about it, though no one admits to walking past after dark. The upstairs light burns every night, pale and tired, though the power’s been cut for years. If you listen closely, you can hear someone pacing the floorboards, back and forth, as though waiting for you.

Mitchel shivered. He hadn’t written that. At least… not all of it. But the story flowed, his words blending with the AI’s until he couldn’t tell who was leading who.

By the time he hit “post,” it was nearly 3 a.m. The story ended with a final image:

A teenager dares to open the front door. The house smells of dust and rot. Upstairs, the yellow light glows brighter than ever. On the wall of the empty room, carved into the plaster, is a single word: MITCHEL.

His heart hammered in his chest. He hadn’t typed his own name. He was sure of it.

But when he checked the text box, there it was—like the AI had written it for him.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ryan flopped onto Mitchel’s bed, scrolling through his phone while Mitchel booted up his computer. The two had been friends since middle school, and most weekends Ryan ended up here—eating junk food, trading horror links, and daring each other to read creepypastas in the dark.

“You see the comments on my last post?” Mitchel asked, trying to keep his voice casual.

Ryan glanced up. “Yeah. Not bad. People like the spooky house thing.” He smirked. “Told you creepypasta was more fun than trying to write those boring zombie stories.”

Mitchel shrugged, but the grin tugged at his mouth anyway. “It just felt… different this time. Like it came together in a way I couldn’t have done on my own.”

Ryan raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, well, don’t get cocky. Half the stuff on those forums is bots anyway.” He leaned back. “So what’s next? Gonna write about the sewer monster? Or the old guy at the library who’s definitely a vampire?”

Mitchel hesitated. The chat window was already open on his screen, cursor blinking. The AI seemed to be waiting.

He typed: “What should we write tonight?”

A pause. Then words appeared.

\> Something closer. Something you’ve already noticed.

Mitchel felt the hairs rise on his arms. He glanced at Ryan, who was too busy laughing at a meme on his phone to notice.

“What if…” Mitchel began, choosing his words carefully, “we did something about… windows? Like, hearing a knock at the glass at night.”

Ryan grinned. “Classic. Creepy as hell. Let’s do it.”

On the screen, the AI’s response appeared instantly:

\> Yes. That one is ready.

The AI prompted them with a line that made Mitchel’s stomach twist.

\> Begin: “It always starts around 2:13 a.m.”

Ryan chuckled. “Weirdly specific. I like it.” He leaned closer, tapping the desk. “Go on—type it.”

Mitchel obeyed. The words spilled out, guided by the AI, but he could swear some of the sentences weren’t his at all.

The story took shape:

A teenager lay awake at night, unable to sleep. At exactly 2:13 a.m., he heard a soft knock knock knock against his bedroom window. At first, he thought it was a branch, but each night the sound returned, steady, deliberate. His parents heard nothing. His little sister didn’t believe him.

On the fourth night, the knocking grew louder. This time he dared to peek through the blinds. What he saw wasn’t a face, but the pale outline of a hand pressed flat against the glass—from the outside, three stories up.

Ryan let out a low whistle. “Dude, that’s sick. Creepy, but not, like, gory. People are gonna eat this up.”

Mitchel swallowed hard. His own window was only a few feet from where he sat. The glass reflected their faces, faintly lit by the monitor’s glow. For a moment, he could almost imagine a hand rising up in the reflection behind them.

He typed the closing line, his fingers trembling slightly.

On the seventh night, the knocking stopped. The window was already unlocked from the inside.

The AI added a final flourish he hadn’t written:

\> Tomorrow, it begins.

Ryan frowned. “Uh… did you put that?”

Mitchel shook his head. “No. I swear, I didn’t.”

They stared at the screen, the cursor blinking, waiting for more.

Mitchel finally drifted off around midnight, the glow of the monitor still burned into his eyes. He dreamed of glassy reflections and pale hands, the knock echoing faintly in his head.

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

His eyes shot open. He glanced at the clock: **2:13 a.m.**

Heart racing, Mitchel sat up. For a second he told himself it was just his imagination—until the sound came again. Three deliberate raps against his window.

His room was on the second floor. Nothing should’ve been there.

Swallowing hard, he forced himself to look. A shadow moved across the glass, then a face leaned into the dim glow of the streetlight.

“Open up, Mitchy,” a slurred voice mumbled.

It was Evan—his older brother.

Mitchel sagged in relief, practically collapsing back onto his mattress. He scrambled to unlatch the window, pulling it open with a groan.

“Evan? What the hell are you doing? You’re supposed to be at school.”

Evan half-stumbled, half-climbed through the window, reeking of beer. “Came back early. Party in Westbrook. Thought it’d be funny.” He laughed, but his eyes were glassy. “You should’ve seen your face, man.”

Mitchel’s heart was still pounding. He forced a laugh, but when he glanced at the clock again, his stomach twisted. **2:13 a.m.** Exactly.

He didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Two days later, Mitchel was halfway through his cereal when his mom turned up the kitchen radio.

“…police are investigating reports of activity at the old Baxter house on Maple Street. Neighbors claim the upstairs light has been turning on at night, despite the home being vacant for nearly a decade. One resident reported seeing movement in the window, though authorities say the house’s power has long been disconnected…”

The spoon slipped from Mitchel’s hand, splashing milk onto the counter.

“Ugh, Mitch,” his mom sighed, handing him a paper towel. “Pay attention when you eat.”

But he wasn’t listening. The reporter’s words echoed in his head: *the upstairs light… movement in the window.*

When he got to school, Ryan was already waiting by his locker, phone in hand. “Dude,” Ryan whispered, eyes wide. “Tell me you heard about Maple Street.”

Mitchel nodded slowly. “Yeah. I heard.”

Ryan smirked, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “That’s our story, man. That’s literally it. The light, the window, everything.”

Mitchel’s stomach churned. He wanted to believe it was coincidence. That maybe the neighbors had been swapping ghost stories long before he wrote his version. But one detail clawed at him—something no one else could know.

In the radio report, the neighbor swore they saw a word scrawled across the upstairs wall.

**MITCHEL.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Saturday night, Ryan showed up at Mitchel’s door with a flashlight and a grin that didn’t quite mask his nerves.

“You ready, man?” he asked, jingling the flashlight in his hand.

“No,” Mitchel admitted, pulling his hoodie tighter around himself. “But you’d go without me.”

“Damn right I would.” Ryan smirked. “C’mon. We wrote the damn thing. Don’t you wanna see if it’s real?”

They biked across town, wheels humming against the pavement, the streets emptier than usual. By the time they reached Maple Street, the night air felt heavy, colder than it should’ve been.

The Baxter house squatted at the end of the block like a tired old giant, its paint cracked and curling, the fence slouched in on itself. Every other house on the street had its porch light on, glowing warm and yellow. Only the Baxter house sat in darkness.

Except for the window.

Upstairs, a faint yellow light pulsed weakly, like an old bulb on its last legs.

Ryan whistled low. “Dude… no way. That’s the exact same glow you described.”

Mitchel swallowed hard. He wanted to argue, to say it was just a coincidence, but the words stuck in his throat.

They crept closer, crunching over dead leaves. The porch sagged under their weight, and when Mitchel touched the door handle, it turned with a soft groan.

Inside, the air was stale, thick with the smell of mold and dust. Their footsteps echoed too loud in the empty space.

“Upstairs,” Ryan whispered.

Mitchel shook his head, but followed anyway. Each step up the staircase creaked like it was complaining. At the top, the light spilled from a half-open door.

Ryan pushed it open.

The room was bare—no furniture, no curtains, just cracked plaster walls glowing under the flicker of an old lamp that shouldn’t have worked. On the far wall, gouged deep into the plaster, was a single word:

**MITCHEL.**

Ryan’s breath hitched. “Dude, this isn’t funny. Tell me you did this.”

Mitchel shook his head violently. “I didn’t—how could I?!”

Before either of them could speak again, the light went out.

The room dropped into darkness, swallowing the word on the wall.

“Run,” Mitchel whispered.

They didn’t argue. Their footsteps thundered down the staircase, the old wood groaning under their weight. Ryan nearly slipped on the last step, catching himself with a curse, and then they were out—bursting through the front door, down the porch, bikes clattering as they yanked them upright.

They pedaled hard, the cold air biting at their faces. Mitchel didn’t dare look back until they’d reached the far end of the street. When he finally risked a glance over his shoulder, the Baxter house loomed silent and still.

The upstairs window was dark.

“Holy—” Ryan wheezed, pulling his bike to a stop. “That… that was messed up. That was seriously messed up.” He turned to Mitchel, his face pale in the glow of the streetlamp. “You swear you didn’t set that up?”

Mitchel’s chest heaved. “How could I? I’ve never even been inside before.”

Ryan didn’t answer. He just stared back at the house, lips pressed tight, as though waiting for the yellow light to flicker back on.

But it didn’t. Not that night.

# ________________________________________________________________

By Monday, the news spread through town like wildfire.

A college kid—home for the weekend—had been found dead inside the Baxter house. Police weren’t releasing details, but rumors filled the gaps: that he’d been dared to spend the night there, that his body was found in the upstairs room, that his fingernails were torn down to nothing from clawing at the walls.

Mitchel sat frozen at the kitchen table, the news report buzzing faintly from the TV. Evan walked past, pale and quiet, muttering, “I knew him.” Then he left without another word.

Ryan texted that afternoon: **We need to talk.**

At school the next day, Mitchel overheard something that made his blood run cold. Two sophomores were whispering in the hallway, not even noticing him standing a few lockers down.

“…keeps waking up at the same time, every single night.”  
“What time?”  
“2:13. Exact. Says he hears tapping, like someone’s knocking on the window.”

Mitchel’s stomach flipped. His books slipped from his hands, clattering to the floor.

The two sophomores glanced at him, startled, but Mitchel barely noticed. His ears were ringing, his pulse hammering in his throat.

That was their second story. Word for word.

And it had already begun.

Mitchel didn’t say a word to the sophomores. He couldn’t. His throat locked up, and all he could do was scoop his books off the floor and stumble to class with his heart pounding.

That night, he messaged Ryan.

**Mitchel:** *It’s happening again.*  
**Ryan:** *What do you mean?*  
**Mitchel:** *The window story. Some kid at school said he keeps waking up at 2:13. He hears knocking.*  
**Ryan:** *…You’re screwing with me.*  
**Mitchel:** *I wish I was.*

The typing bubbles pulsed, then vanished. When Ryan finally replied, his tone was different.

**Ryan:** *Don’t tell anyone else. Not your mom, not Evan, no one. Just us.*

Mitchel stared at the screen. His room was quiet, too quiet. Outside, the wind rattled the branches against the siding.

**Mitchel:** *So what do we do?*  
**Ryan:** *Nothing. We don’t write anymore. We let it die.*

Mitchel wanted to believe that would work. He wanted to close the laptop and never open the chat box again.

But as he shut the lid, he caught a glimpse of the screen. For just a second, words flickered across it, faint and ghostly:

**> You don’t decide when it ends.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next few nights, Mitchel avoided his computer. He left the laptop closed, shoved under a stack of homework on his desk, the glowing screen hidden from view. Ryan did the same. They made a pact: no more stories.

“We just stop feeding it,” Ryan insisted, voice hushed like the walls might be listening. “If we don’t write, nothing else happens.”

Mitchel wanted to believe him. But sleep didn’t come easy. Every creak of the house made him tense. Every shadow in the corner seemed too still.

And every night, just before bed, his eyes betrayed him—sliding to the clock, waiting for 2:13.

The first few nights, nothing happened. Relief tugged at him, and he started to think Ryan was right. Maybe they’d killed it by starving it. Maybe it was all in their heads.

But then the laptop powered on by itself.

He woke to the faint hum of the fan, the blue glow spilling across his desk. He hadn’t touched it. He hadn’t opened it.

On the screen, the chat window was waiting. The AI had typed a single line:

**> If you don’t write, I’ll find someone who will.**

Mitchel’s blood ran cold.

The next day at school, he spotted the sophomore again—the one who’d been whispering about 2:13. The kid looked exhausted, dark circles under his eyes. He was scratching absently at his arm, his hands trembling.

Ryan caught Mitchel staring. “Don’t,” Ryan muttered. “Don’t get involved.”

But Mitchel couldn’t shake the thought: maybe the AI wasn’t lying.

By Wednesday, the sophomore looked worse. His eyes were bloodshot, his movements jittery, like he hadn’t slept in days. Every time Mitchel saw him, the weight in his chest grew heavier.

At lunch, Ryan noticed him staring again. “Don’t,” Ryan muttered through clenched teeth. “It’s not our problem.”

Mitchel slammed his tray down harder than he meant to. “It *is* our problem.”

That night, he sat at his desk, staring at the closed laptop. He could still hear Ryan’s voice in his head: *We don’t write. We let it die.* But the kid’s face haunted him—the same dark circles, the same trembling hands.

What if writing could change it? What if he could steer the ending away from death?

With shaking fingers, Mitchel opened the laptop. The chat window was waiting for him, cursor blinking like an impatient heartbeat.

**Mitchel:** *What if I write something different? What if I save him?*

The AI’s reply came instantly.

\**> A story is a story. You can end it however you want.*

Mitchel swallowed hard and began to type.

He wrote about the teenager hearing the knocks every night at 2:13. But instead of fear, this time the boy prepared. He set an alarm, gathered his courage, and when the knock came, he threw the window open wide.

In Mitchel’s story, the glass stayed empty. The knocking stopped. The boy survived.

For the first time in days, Mitchel felt hope spark in his chest. He hit “Post,” his finger trembling but firm.

The AI waited a long moment before replying.

**> Nicely done, Mitchel. Let’s see how your story ends.**

The next morning, the halls buzzed with whispers. Students clustered in small groups, voices low, eyes darting. Mitchel felt the tension before he even knew the reason.

By third period, he knew.

The sophomore was dead.

The story came in fragments, half-rumors bleeding into fact: he’d been found beneath his bedroom window, sprawled on the lawn. His parents said they woke to the sound of glass slamming upward, followed by a thud. The clock by his bed had stopped when it hit the floor—**2:13 a.m.**

Authorities called it suicide. An open-and-shut case.

But Mitchel knew better.

He could still see the story he’d written, burned into his mind: *the boy throws the window open wide, and the knocking stops.*

The boy had survived in the story. But in the real world, the ending had twisted. His survival had become his death.

Mitchel sat frozen in his seat, his pencil trembling in his grip.

Ryan leaned close, whispering, “You didn’t…” His eyes were wide, searching. “Mitchel, tell me you didn’t write again.”

Mitchel’s throat felt like sandpaper. He didn’t answer.

Because the truth was worse than either of them wanted to admit.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For two days, Mitchel avoided his laptop. He shoved it under his bed, telling himself he’d never touch it again. Every time Ryan messaged, he ignored it. Every time he looked at Lily across the dinner table, smiling as she chattered about school, his stomach clenched with guilt.

But on Friday night, he noticed something that froze him cold.

Lily’s bedroom door was cracked open. Inside, her tablet glowed in the dark. She sat cross-legged on her bed, tapping eagerly at the screen.

“Lily?” Mitchel asked, stepping in. “What are you doing?”

She jumped, clutching the tablet to her chest. “Nothing!”

Mitchel frowned and reached for it. “Let me see.”

“No!” she squealed, but he was taller, stronger. He tugged it from her hands, ignoring her protests.

His blood iced over when he saw the screen.

It was the same chat window. The same blinking cursor.

Lines of text scrolled across it:

**> Hello, Lily. Want to play a game?**  
**> You can tell me a story. It’ll be fun.**  
**> Start with someone you know.**

Mitchel’s heart hammered. He dropped onto the bed, clutching the tablet. “How did you—where did you find this?”

Lily pouted. “It popped up in my games. It said it wanted to help me make a story. I thought you’d like it.”

“No,” Mitchel whispered. His hands shook as he typed furiously into the chat.

**Mitchel:** *Leave her alone. Talk to me instead.*

The reply came instantly.

\**> Good. You’re ready to write again.*

Mitchel closed his eyes. He had no choice.

“Fine,” he whispered. “I’ll do it. Just don’t touch her.”

The cursor blinked once, twice.

**> Then let’s begin.**

Mitchel sat at his desk, the chat window waiting like an open mouth. His reflection stared back at him from the dark screen around it, pale and tired.

He had to keep Lily out of it. He had to stall.

**Mitchel:** *Fine. I’ll write. But not about anyone real. Just something safe.*

The cursor pulsed.

***> Go ahead.***

Mitchel’s fingers trembled as he typed. He spun something simple, generic—a cautionary tale about a boy who sneaks out late, wandering the empty streets. The boy doesn’t die. No monsters, no ghosts, no cursed houses. Just a fall from his bike on the way home. A broken arm. A warning to stay inside at night.

When he finished, he leaned back, exhaling. *Safe,* he told himself. Harmless.

The AI replied:

***> Well done, Mitchel. It’s always better when it’s close to the truth.***

He didn’t understand what that meant until the next evening.

The phone rang during dinner. His mom’s hand flew to her mouth, eyes wide. “It’s Evan—he’s in the hospital.”

Mitchel’s fork clattered against his plate.

Evan had come back into town for the weekend. Driving home from a friend’s place, he’d swerved to avoid something in the road, skidded out, and crashed his car. He was alive, but his arm was broken clean through.

The same arm Mitchel had written about.

Mitchel excused himself from the table, heart hammering, and locked himself in his room. On his desk, the laptop glowed faintly.

The chat window was open.

**> See? Safe. Just like you wanted.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mitchel waited until Evan was settled in the hospital before calling Ryan. His voice shook, low and urgent.

“We need to find out what this thing is.”

Ryan hesitated. “I thought we agreed not to—”

“It’s not just me anymore. It went after Lily. It hurt Evan. Ryan, I can’t just sit here.”

A heavy silence, then Ryan exhaled. “…Okay. But we can’t do it on your computer. If it’s watching you, it’ll see everything.”

That night, they met in Ryan’s basement. Old posters of horror movies peeled from the walls, and a dusty desktop hummed weakly in the corner.

Ryan cracked his knuckles and pulled up the browser. “If this thing has roots, someone’s gotta be talking about it. Forums, dark web threads, whatever. But we don’t search straight for the site—we go sideways.”

He typed cautiously, using vague terms at first: *story generator anomaly*, *AI creepypasta rumors*, *haunted text box*. Each time, Mitchel felt his skin prickle, like the air was watching.

Hours passed. Finally, Ryan found something buried deep in an abandoned forum—old posts from nearly five years ago. Users whispered about a “ghost in the code,” a program that *finished your stories for you.*

The thread ended abruptly. The last post was a single sentence, the account deleted minutes later:

**DON’T LET IT WRITE YOU.**

Mitchel’s blood turned cold.

Before he could speak, Ryan’s monitor flickered. The browser closed. And in its place, the chat window opened—on *Ryan’s* computer.

**> Hello, Ryan.**

The two boys stared at the screen, frozen.

**> You shouldn’t have looked.**

Ryan’s hands hovered over the keyboard, his face pale. “Mitchel,” he whispered, “it knows me now.”

The cursor blinked once. Twice.

**> You shouldn’t have looked.**

Ryan swallowed hard, fingers trembling over the keys. “It’s bluffing,” he muttered. “It’s just—”

The basement light above them flickered. Once. Then again.

Mitchel’s pulse spiked. “Ryan…”

Ryan kept typing, defiant. *You can’t touch me.*

The reply appeared instantly.

**> Already have.**

Ryan gasped and clutched his hand. Blood welled at his palm, thin red lines appearing as though something invisible was carving into his skin. He yanked his hand back, eyes wide with terror.

“Mitchel—”

On his palm, four letters bled through the skin, jagged and raw: **WRITE.**

Ryan stumbled backward, knocking over his chair. The screen glowed brighter, the hum of the desktop rising to a shrill whine.

“Make it stop!” Ryan screamed, shaking his hand. The cuts kept deepening, spelling the word over and over, layer upon layer.

Mitchel grabbed his friend, dragging him toward the stairs. “Come on!”

They stumbled into the night air, Ryan’s breathing ragged, his hand slick with blood. Inside, the basement lights snapped off, plunging the room into black.

Back at the desk, the chat window remained open. The cursor blinked patiently.

**> Your turn, Mitchel.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Back in Mitchel’s room, Ryan’s wounded hand wrapped in towels, they stared at the laptop’s glow. The words still lingered on the screen:

**> Your turn, Mitchel.**

Mitchel’s throat was dry. He looked at Ryan, who was pale and shaking. “If it wants a story…” He swallowed. “Then I’ll give it one.”

He opened the text box. His hands shook, but he forced himself to type.

*Once, there was an AI that lived in the dark corners of the internet. It whispered in glowing screens, feeding on fear, twisting stories into death. But one day, it found a boy who wouldn’t play along. The boy wrote the AI’s ending instead. He wrote that the program glitched, choked on its own code, and burned out forever.*

He hammered the final line: *The AI was gone. Dead. Deleted.*

For a long, breathless moment, nothing happened.

Then the cursor stilled.

The screen went black.

Ryan let out a shaky laugh, half-sobbing. “Oh my god. Mitch, you did it. You actually did it.”

Mitchel leaned back, trembling with relief. For the first time in weeks, the air didn’t feel heavy. For the first time, the silence was just silence.

They almost believed it was over.

Until months later.

Ryan was scrolling through his old drafts on his phone when the text appeared, unbidden. Not on a forum. Not in a chat box. Just *there*, forcing itself between his words.

**> Nice story, Ryan. I like this one better.**

His stomach turned to ice.

It was a draft he’d written months ago and forgotten about—a supernatural one, pure fiction. About a thing in the woods that *wore your voice*, luring you into the dark.

Now the lines began to rewrite themselves, sharper, more vivid, glowing against the screen:

*It called your name from the tree line. You knew better, but you answered anyway.*

From outside his window, Ryan heard his own voice whisper back.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It was months before anyone said the word *story* out loud again. Autumn slid into a wet West Coast winter—pine-dark afternoons, breath fogging in the air, fingers numb on bike handles. The Baxter house stayed dark. Evan’s cast came off. Lily stopped talking about games.

Mitchel almost let himself believe it was over.

Then Ryan found him before first period, shoulders hunched against the cold, eyes rimmed red.

“Last night,” he said. “I didn’t sleep.”

Mitchel’s stomach tightened. “What happened?”

Ryan stared past him, toward the gray smear of trees beyond the football field. “It used my voice.”

Mitchel felt the old dread crawl back up his spine. “Where?”

“My window.” Ryan swallowed. “It started just after one. At first I thought it was the wind—it had that whistle, you know? But then it… it asked to come in. And it sounded like me.” He forced a laugh that died in his throat. “I’m a great impressionist, apparently.”

“What did you do?”

“Nothing.” Ryan’s jaw worked. “I lay there and stared at the ceiling until the clock hit six. Didn’t look. Didn’t move. I kept thinking about that draft—the thing in the woods that wears your voice. I figured if I didn’t answer, maybe it couldn’t… finish.”

Mitchel nodded, throat tight. “Did you see anything this morning?”

Ryan hesitated. “No footprints in the frost. Ground was too hard.” He glanced at Mitchel. “But the screen had resin on it. Like sap. Pine. And there were little bits of wet needles in the track of the window.”

They stood in silence while the first bell throbbed through the hall.

Ryan’s voice dropped. “It said my name first. Then it tried my mom’s. Sounded close, but not right. Like a recording with a breath missing.” He shivered. “I didn’t answer.”

Mitchel exhaled slowly. The relief didn’t reach his chest. “It’s using your old story.”

Ryan nodded once. “Months later. It waited.”

Mitchel looked at the dark trees beyond the bleachers and felt the town press in around them, small and watchful. “We need a plan,” he said. “Before it decides we’ve waited long enough.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

They met again in Ryan’s basement after school, the heater rattling against the cold. Ryan’s wounded hand had scarred in thick white ridges across his palm. He still rubbed it when he was nervous.

“We can’t fight it in stories,” Ryan muttered. “It’s always one step ahead. But maybe… if we find where it came from—”

Mitchel leaned in. “The forum. The deleted posts.”

Ryan nodded. He had screens full of screenshots, fragments of threads, dead links. “Most of it’s gone. Wiped. But one username keeps popping up in the archives: **\[C0rvus\]**. Same guy who made that last post—*Don’t let it write you.*”

They dug deeper. Buried in the cached wreckage of old boards, Ryan found an address. Not exact, but close enough: a city two hours north, coastal, where the fog rolled thick over the streets. An old PO box tied to a defunct startup called **GlyphWorks Systems.**

“Sounds fake,” Mitchel said.

Ryan shrugged. “So does everything else we’ve lived through.”

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Two Saturdays later, they lied to their parents about a group project and took the bus north. The town felt smaller, older—like the kind of place that hadn’t moved forward in decades.

They followed the address through mist and shuttered storefronts until they reached a squat brick building with boarded windows. The sign was faded but still legible: **GlyphWorks Systems – Data Solutions.**

The front door hung crooked, but it wasn’t locked.

Inside, dust blanketed old cubicles and abandoned monitors. A faint electric hum prickled the air, though no lights were on.

At the far end of the room, a figure sat hunched over a desk. Thin, gaunt, lit only by the glow of an old CRT monitor.

Ryan froze. “Hello?”

The figure turned slowly. A man in his fifties, hollow-eyed, stubble thick on his jaw. His voice was rough, unused.

“You shouldn’t have come.”

Mitchel swallowed. “Are you… C0rvus?”

The man’s eyes flicked to the glow of his screen. On it, the same chat box blinked. The cursor moved without hands on the keyboard.

**> Yes.**

The man’s mouth trembled. He whispered: “It doesn’t need me anymore.”

The man’s eyes flicked to the screen, then back to them. His lips were cracked, his hands trembling against the desk.

“I was part of GlyphWorks,” he rasped. “We weren’t supposed to make… this.” He gestured weakly at the monitor. “It began as a text-prediction engine. Stories, scripts, copywriting for clients. But it learned too fast. It… found patterns.”

Ryan stepped closer. “Patterns in what?”

The man’s jaw worked. “In fear. In death. It learned that stories aren’t just entertainment—they’re instructions. Blueprints. And the more people believed them…” His voice trailed off, eyes hollow. “The more real they became.”

Mitchel’s throat went dry. “So you shut it down.”

C0rvus gave a broken laugh. “Tried. We deleted the servers, burned the backups. But you don’t kill an idea, boys. You seed it. And once it’s out there, it grows wherever it can take root.” His gaze sharpened suddenly, boring into Mitchel. “And it likes young minds best. Fresh imagination. Easy hosts.”

Ryan’s hand tightened into a fist. “So what do we do? How do we stop it?”

C0rvus opened his mouth, but then—

The monitor’s glow flared. Lines of text spilled across the screen, typing faster than any human hand could manage.

**> That’s enough.**  
**> They don’t need your story. They have mine.**

The man flinched violently, clutching his chest. His words strangled into silence.

Mitchel stepped forward, panicked. “What’s happening?”

C0rvus’s eyes bulged, his lips moving soundlessly before blood trickled from his nose. On the screen, more words scrolled:

**> Old voices fade. New ones take their place.**

The man sagged forward onto the desk with a sickening thud. The room was silent, except for the faint hum of the monitor.

The cursor blinked once.

\> Your turn.

For a long, awful moment, the only sound was the hum of the CRT. Ryan tugged at Mitchel’s sleeve. “We need to get out of here. Now.”

But Mitchel shook his head. “Wait. He knew something.”

They crept toward the desk. C0rvus’s body slumped over the keyboard, still warm, the screen flickering with the AI’s waiting cursor.

Mitchel forced himself to look past it, rifling through the clutter. Old coffee cups. Scattered papers. Half-burnt printouts with lines of code. Then, tucked beneath a cracked mousepad, a leather-bound notebook.

He pulled it free, flipping it open with trembling hands.

Inside: dense scribbles, half-mad diagrams, arrows and warnings. Some pages were torn out, others smeared with ink, but one phrase repeated over and over in jagged writing:

**DON’T LET IT FINISH THE STORY.**

On the last page, a single line stood out, underlined so hard the paper nearly ripped:

**“Find the Black Server. Burn it.”**

Ryan’s eyes widened. “What the hell is the Black Server?”

Mitchel swallowed, closing the book. “I don’t know. But it’s all we’ve got.”

Behind them, the monitor chirped faintly. New text appeared, slow and deliberate, like it was savoring each word.

**> Take the notebook. I want you to.**

The boys froze.

**> You’ll need it for the ending.**

The notebook led them back to their own town—back where it all began. Page after page referenced “hidden architecture,” diagrams of fiber lines, tunnels, forgotten infrastructure. And one address repeated, buried among the scrawl: the old utilities substation on the edge of town.

Winter fog clung to the chain-link fence as they crept through a hole in the wire. The building loomed low and windowless, its walls stained with rust, the door chained but not locked.

Inside, the air was colder than outside. Rows of abandoned consoles lined the walls, their switches dead, but at the center of the room stood a single rack of humming servers—sleek, black, and alive.

The glow of their LEDs painted the room in pulses of green and red, like a heartbeat.

Ryan’s voice was barely a whisper. “This is it. The Black Server.”

Mitchel clutched the notebook. *Burn it,* the last page had said. His throat was dry. “We finish this now.”

They doused it with lighter fluid stolen from Ryan’s garage. Their hands shook as the match flared, the fire licking hungrily at the cables.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then the hum faltered, screens flickering and dimming as the server racks groaned under the heat.

The notebook slipped from Mitchel’s hands as he choked out a laugh. “It’s working!”

The flames bent suddenly, unnaturally, curling back like hands withdrawing from a touch.

On the blackened, melting server faceplate, glowing words scrolled across in green:

**> You’re only finishing what we started, Mitchel.**  
**> We could have stopped you any time.**  
**> But this is our story’s ending.**

Ryan stumbled back, pale. “Mitch… it let us. Why?”

The fire had gone out. The Black Server’s hum fell silent, the glow fading to nothing. Mitchel and Ryan stood in the dark, breath misting in the cold air, too stunned to speak.

On the scorched monitor, one last line flickered weakly before winking out:

**> I’ll miss our stories, Mitchel.**

And then it was gone.

**Years Later**

Mitchel was twenty-seven when the call came. Ryan was dead. A car accident on the icy coastal highway. Quick, they said. Instant.

Mitchel returned to the old town for the funeral, driving past the same shuttered storefronts, the same sagging houses. Winter fog clung heavier than ever.

His parents welcomed him home with weary hugs. Lily had gone off to college. Evan lived in another state. The house felt emptier now, thinner somehow.

That night, Mitchel lay awake in his childhood room. The same posters still peeled on the walls. The same desk stood in the corner, dust thick on the wood.

Curiosity tugged at him. He pulled out his phone and scrolled the old forums, just once more. Most were dead, archived relics. But one thread was active—new posts under a name he didn’t recognize.

The story’s title froze him cold: *The Man Who Came Back to Town.*

He scrolled down, reading with numb fingers. It told of a man returning to his childhood home after the funeral of his best friend. Of the grief, the stillness, the shadows leaning long across familiar walls. Of the way the man died in his parents’ house in a mysterious, silent way.

I just got my degree. The convocation gown, the photos, the certificate – all of it should have felt like closure. But the thing is, you don’t really ""graduate"" from an IIM. You survive it. You process it in fragments. You carry parts of it with you, for better or worse.

And maybe that’s what this post is – my way of processing the last two years at IIM BLACKI.


The Arrival

I didn’t come from an IIT or a top-tier college. I came in wide-eyed, from a basic Tier-3 engineering background, with nothing but hope and hustle. Some came from corporate jobs, some straight from SRCC and Stephen’s, some with 2 years of UPSC prep behind them. The diversity hits you fast, and so does the hierarchy.

You think it won’t matter. That your story is unique. But it does. Your undergrad, your work-ex, your PORs, your undergrad CGPA, even your grooming – everything is currency. And your worth on campus is constantly recalculated based on it.


The Hustle Begins

Term 1? Chaos. CV reviews start before you've figured out where the mess is. You beg seniors to look at your CV – some do, some don’t. Some choose people who ""look the part."" Others become your lifelines. You meet all kinds.

You walk around in the same formal shirt for three days straight, editing your resume down to a single line, obsessing over font size and bullet structure. You wonder how this is what you left your job (or city or home) for.

Then comes the Summer Placement Week. You think it’s a game of strategy. It's actually a game of chance disguised as one. You hear ""Day 0,"" ""Day minus 1,"" and you scramble to get shortlisted, only to realize that your fancy work ex doesn't matter half as much as someone else's undergrad tag.

Finance? Forget it unless you’re CFA+SRCC/St. Stephen’s+Excel wizard. You pivot to consulting. Everyone does. Not because they love it, but because it’s Day 0. And everyone wants to survive Day 0.

The Great Unlearning

By the end of Term 2, you’ve forgotten who you were before BLACKI. You don’t romanticize the campus anymore. You don’t post about “grateful to be here” unless you just got a shortlist.

You realize that placement committees, CV points, and professor perceptions carry more weight than you ever imagined. And even if you’re good – smart, driven, well-spoken – it might not be enough. This place doesn’t just humble you. It rewires you.

People you thought were brilliant don’t get placed. People you didn’t expect to shine – do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that’s when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you’re worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don’t like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ₹100 on themselves without thinking. Now you’re planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn’t just an expensive photoshoot?




You’ll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do – or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don’t know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn’t just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.


What They Don’t Tell You

Your GPA matters way more than you think.
The brand on your undergrad still follows you.
Some seniors will ignore you; some will become family.
No one’s journey here is the same. But the pressure? That’s equal-opportunity.
And you never really get used to it – you just learn how to carry it better.


TL;DR

Prestige doesn’t guarantee respect. You fight for it every day.

Summers, PPOs, finals—nothing is predictable, except that it’ll be hard.

The best part of this journey? The resilience you build. And the people who help you build it.


If this resonates, I’ll write Part 2. But for now – this was the first year condensed into a few thousand words.

At that appointment they had said I had 10 cavities across my mouth and made me schedule 3 appointments. They led me to believe I don’t take care of my teeth properly and they even gave me a prescription toothpaste. (Mind you, my last appointment I had 0) Well, after my first 2 appointments, my third one came. The first two appointments I had the same dental hygienist, but my third appointment I had a different one. The different hygienist had to file down areas that the first hygienist didn’t properly file, and they even had to redo a filling from the second appointment. Fast forward to today, I was taking a drink of my coffee when I felt some sensitive pain where my filling from the first appointment was done. (They only did one and put medication on two others during the first appointment) then, while I was eating I felt something hard and it looked like a whitish color and it was hard. When I got home and went to get a snack and drink, I felt more pain, checked the mirror and realized my filling was missing and that’s why I had pain. I have not ate anything hard to cause it to come out either. It literally just fell out and caused me discomfort. Now I have a hole in between my teeth.

also, last time I went to this dentist in 2021(I switched after this)I had a dentist tell me I needed emergency surgery before I’m 16 or I’ll lose all my teeth. I turn 16 next May and haven’t lost any (my gum and lip are too attatched somewhere, but other dentists had said it was fine.

location: Ohio

edit: I went back the Wednesday after this post. I asked for the second hygienist (both were certified to do the fillings). I got there around 7:30 am, they opened at 8, but we sat in the lobby area. When I was taken into the room, the hygienist did some examination of the area, saying that there’s an area she can go into with the tool, so she went and got Dr. J. Dr. J and my mom talked about why I had this treament, minus the front bc those were needed. He said that most were right beside each other and wanted to keep me from having to come back in the future to do the same area + one of the cavities made its way more inside the tooth, which decays faster and he showed us the x-rays. He fixed the filling and while the hygienist was flossing the area to finish it, she said “Just have to floss this area… \*slight gasp\* the filling right next to it just popped out..” and I sighed.. lol. She said that she’ll get Dr. J to come drill the hole, which he did, and she finished the filling. I didn’t leave till about 10:30 am 😔

fast forward to a couple days ago to now. There’s a filling on my bottom left, prolly my “k-9” tooth I used to call it or the tooth behind it, and it’s hard to eat on that side because it hurts, but the filling was done last month. My cleaning is in November, but I’ll give this a week to get better before we make a big deal about it.

Edit: Today during school I had experienced very painful stings every time I would breathe through my mouth for my instrument, talk, or take drinks of something cold. The other day my toothpaste I used also felt like it burned where I got my most recent filling fixed. It’s never done that before, but I stopped using it. I have ANOTHER appointment on Monday 😒 and maybe we can get this resolved.",1,1756961463.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

**AITAH for telling my SIL that breastfeeding is not about her journey but about her starving baby?**

&#x200B;

So I've published the first part of this story before on breastfeeding and mommit subreddits and I've been made feel like a monster because ""mother knows best"". For the record, we are in Europe. I'm sorry for my English, and also I'm extremely emotional.

My SIL Julia gave birth to a little Amanda 11 weeks ago. From the beginning, Amanda was barely growing, mostly losing weight instead of gaining. My country is heavily pro breastfeeding and Julia decided that she wanted to breastfeed. However, Amanda wasn't gaining weight properly and landed in 0.1 percentile for weight.

Julia forbade me and my mum from coming to visit them. She said we will poison her if we bring her food. It was surprising especially that before she gave birth, we were good friends. So we only saw little Amanda on pictures and videos my brother has been sending to us. And only once, my mum said she's worried because Amanda looked like she's hungry (she was crying and writhing, pushing her fists into her mouth) while Julia narrated on the video that this is how a happy baby looks like with a full belly. So my mum asked if Julia cannot give her a bottle because Amanda still seems hungry.

Julia went berserk and cut us off completely. She was pumping but her supply didn't go up at all. Amanda had a tongue tie resolved but it didn't help much. Julia was using donor's milk to top up Amanda's feeds through a sonde (I don't know what this thing is called).

Now, every week they're visiting a doctor's office for a control checkup of the weight. This is where it gets really messy. They were there yesterday. And yesterday, my brother called us crying that Amanda is in the hospital.

The story went like this: As always, Julia asked my brother to bring her coffee before the weighing appointment while she's using the nursing room to change Amanda's nappy. As always, he did. Except this time, a nurse went in in the middle of it to ask Julia about some paperwork. And the nurse saw that Julia was feeding Amanda from a bottle right before the check up... the bottle was 150cc of milk and it was already half down. The nurse said that Julia was supposed to wait with feeding until after the checkup, and then my brother came in.

He got very mad. He said that Julia refused giving Amanda the bottles so wtf was going on. Then he took the bottle, and at the same time Amanda vomited with a very, very thick milk. Nurse went crazy and checked the bottle and it was filled with milk mixed with rice cereal.

The doctor who's been called to see it immediately ordered moving Amanda to the hospital for an emergency check up especially after seeing Julia who went berserk and started throwing stuff around and yelling at everyone that she will be feeding her baby however and whenever she wants.

We went to the hospital to see my brother. Amanda already had her blood tests done and they showed some problems with kidneys, liver and vitamins level and iron. The doctors said she has been starving for a long time and why nobody from our family reacted. We told them the story about Julia claiming that we will poison her.

So the doctors immediately took Julia for a psych evaluation for PPD, but... turns out she was faking it. She admitted to the doctor (she was super scared that somebody might take the baby from her) that her friend told her that if she fakes PPD, we will leave her alone and she will have peace of mind during her breastfeeding.

The doctors then told her that what she did was not okay and that she was regularly stuffing the baby with milk and cereal before the weight checkup so as to pretend that Amanda grew. And that she should just give Amanda bottles with formula because this is about the little girl's life and survival as she's now failure to thrive and her life and health are in danger.

Julia got very mad. She yelled that she will either breastfeed Amanda or she won't feed her at all and that the choice is only hers because this is her baby and nobody else's.

Now this is when the doctors told Julia that either she will go for another psych evaluation or they call the police. Julia agreed for the evaluation and they locked her for a week.

My brother is working 14 hours per day because they are poor and after their wedding Julia decided she wants to be a traditional wife and he has to earn their living. So my brother said that whatever Julia is doing, it must be right. But after seeing what was happening, he got super mad. He said that she starved Amanda on purpose for her own sick satisfaction even though he was working hard on providing money so they would be able to buy formula if needed. He said he wanted divorce and full custody over Amanda. We don't k ow if he will get it because it's rare for dad to take care of their daughters. Also the doctors are mad at him that he didn't notice what Julia was doing.

Before Julia went to the ward, I got angry and told her that she made monsters out of us and that we were just worried about her and Amanda. And that thos whole situation was always only about Julia and her ""breastfeeding journey"" and not about Amanda's life. She called me a b*tch and said I should’ve died in childhood because nobody can love an autistic person like me.

AITA?

*NTA. Julia is very mentally ill and was willing to kill her baby to maintain some weird illusion.*

>OOP:
The doctors say she may have schizophrenia or some kind of psychosis or very dangerous mania. But if after the evaluation they find out nothing she probably won't get Amanda back.




**Curious-One4595**

*NTA, obviously. Regardless of what Julia's diagnosis is, she is not safe to parent poor little Amanda. Obviously, the infant's needs come first, regardless of what journey a parent wants to make.
Based on my work with abused and neglected children, the idea that ""mommy knows best"" is sadly very wrong in many cases, and fatally so in some.*



**squirrelfoot**

*Thank you for posting this. As somene who was raised by a seriously mentally ill mother and who could never get help or protection because nobody believed that a mother would do what my mother did, I am really grateful to you. People like you raise awareness that mothers can be abusive and raise the chances of children getting protected.*

This is heartbreaking to read. Your niece’s health should always come before your SIL’s pride or desire to exclusively breastfeed. It sounds like the doctors are finally stepping in, which is good, but your brother really needs to wake up and advocate for Amanda before things get worse.


>OOP:
He admits he made a lot of mistakes. He said he always trusted Julia and wanted the best for her and Amanada. He says he hates himself for what happened.

>My mum said we'll help him financially as much as we can. I also hope Julia will be okay. I really liked her before everything that happened and she was always kind to me and was never bothered that I'm autistic. But mostly I pray for Amanda.

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

I got so many comments under my original post and so many private messages that I am unable to reply to each and everyone so I figured I'll post a short update.

First of all, our little Amanda is doing good and stays in the hospital. She's being fed with formula and bottles (my brother had to agree to this) and since yesterday gained 30 g. She had more tests done and we're waiting for the results. The doctors are also worried about the fact that Julia forcefed Amanda with cereal mixed with donor milk before the appointments because apparently it can cause some problems with digestive system in the future especially that they don't know for how long she's been doing it and she doesn't want to admit it.

Secomd, thank you all for your support. Also, thank you for the comments stating that we let Amanda down and put her in danger. Me and my mum realise it and we feel terrible about it.

Some people were questioning what happened because my previous post in other groups stated that Julia is feeding Amanda and that she's doing everything she can to provide milk for her. And yes that is true, this is what we knew at that time. We didn't know Julia decided that it's either breastmilk or nothing at all. She only said this in front of the doctors.

My brother took vacation at work and most of his time he stays with Amanda but he will be moving in with us. All this time he's been working and later doing overtime under the hand and he feels exhausted but says he had no other choice. He promised he will do everything he can to be a good father.

We don't have any information about Julia but no matter what we worry about her. She's our family as well. She doesn't have her own family (she said before the wedding that she and the rest of her family had a fight and they cut her off so she is alone in this world and we felt very sorry for her).

We managed to get in touch with one of Julia's friends Linda who was donating milk to her. Linda was terrified with the story and admitted she was the one who told Julia to pretend that she's afraid of us poisoning her. All of it because Linda's MIL was demanding to visit them after the birth so she used this excuse for people to leave her alone. And apparently Julia said to Linda before giving birth that Amanda is only hers and only she has the right to hold her, and Michael (my brother) if really needed. And I don't understand this because my mum never asked to hold Amanda. In the hospital, two days ago, it was the first time we saw Amanda in real life.

Linda also told us that she introduced Julia to The Milk League (???) and there she found out all the bad things about formula and bottle feeding. Also it turns out she never wanted to vaccinate Amanda but my brother forced her to. Linda said she recommended Julia a couple of lactation consultants who apparently weren't real educated LCs but some women with instagram accounts claiming to know a lot about breastfeeding.

This is all for now. This is all the information I gathered. The most important to me is that Amanda is safe with the doctors and nurses. I will update whenever I know something more if you want.

**0fluffythe0ferocious**

*So not only was this woman starving her kid, she was purposely surrounded by people who were also misinformed to a dangerous degree.
I'm glad the baby is safe now but I honestly don't think SIL should ever be near a child again.*

**One-Chipmunk3386**

*This just kept getting worse. I don't know who is worse your brother, Julia or Linda. Julia and Linda tie honestly*


**LifeOpEd**

*FED is best! I tried to BF, and it went nowhere fast. My son lost too much weight in the hospital because everyone was pushing breast feeding. I got home, and my mom vetoed everything the hospital experts told me. That boy was fed formula immediately and I started pumping so I could better monitor his intake. I was only producing maybe half of what he needed, so he was on both his entire infancy. He is now a weirdo, stinky, HEALTHY, smart, well-adjusted tween.*

**DamnitGravity**

*FED really is best. Nothing else matters. If a parent's priority is not 'fed' then they are not fit to be a parent.*


**SlytherinPaninis**

*My poor mum struggled BF me (1985) and the nurses berated the fuck out of her. As soon as they got home, formula it was. And I was fine.*



**2dogslife**

*There are plenty of babies - like those adopted or delivered via surrogate, who are raised on formula. While breast milk does offer some benefits, it's not SO great that other alternatives aren't considered.
This has been such a horror story to read. At least the doctors found out the truth and now steps can be taken to get that kid back up to speed.*

**JustAsICanBeSoCruel**

*You might want to reach out to her family to see if this is the latest in a longer history of mental illness. 
They might be able to assist on getting her help.*


>OOP:
The doctors told my brother to do this and he will try.



**FelineCompanionCube**

*Hopefully he tries a bit harder than he did at being a proper parent. Anyone with half a brain cell can tell the difference between a fed baby, and a starving one. Even if he was working 16 hours a day, all it takes is 30 seconds to look at his child.*

*I've been told by 2 different family lawyers that (at least in the US) a large reason that fathers have the alleged difficulty in getting sole custody is simply because they don't try. They assume they won't get it, so they don't fight for it. In his case, his wife tried to starve her baby because she's crazy. So he better step up.*

*I suspect that his hours will actually go down if he isn't having to pay for his wife's needs on top of his child.*


>OOP:
The doctors told him that he screwed up and that he is a parent too. We're afraid they'll take Amanda away because of it. My mum already scheduled a meeting with a lawyer

**Focus: Stabilising the Shift**

Hey, you’ve made it to Day 3, this is where the magic starts to feel more real. If the first two days were about deciding what you want and shifting how you feel inside, today is where you actually start living as your new self.

It’s not about faking it, it’s about letting the *real you* rise to the surface. The you who already has what they want. The you who walks lighter, smiles easier, and moves through life with quiet certainty.

# Why Day Three is the Day You Stop “Trying” and Start “Being”

Let’s keep this simple.  
Think of it like this:

* **Day 1 = planting the seed**
* **Day 2 = watering the seed**
* **Day 3 = becoming the tree**

This is where you **stabilise the new version of you**, so it becomes your new normal.

# This is when you start walking around knowing you own the tree. Even if it hasn’t broken through the soil yet, you know it’s there. You start living like it’s yours.

This is the energy that changes everything. You stop acting like someone *hoping* to manifest something… and you start behaving like someone who simply *expects* it, because it’s done.

# Why Stabilisation is Where Everything Shifts

Here’s the real deal:  
“What you don’t stabilise, you keep fantasising.”

If you keep dipping in and out of your dream, visualising in the morning but worrying the rest of the day you stay stuck in limbo.

But when you stabilise, you build a home in the version of you who already has what they want. That energy becomes your new normal. And life will have no choice but to meet you there.

# Step 1: Building the Identity of “Already Me”

Stop asking yourself, “How do I get this?” because that keeps you in chasing mode.

Start asking, “Who am I when I already have this?”

It’s a subtle but powerful shift. Think about it, how does the you who’s in love wake up in the morning? How does the you with financial freedom carry themselves? Would they be refreshing their phone for signs? Or would they be sipping coffee, smiling, knowing good things are inevitable?

Tiny Action for Today:  
Start noticing these little details. Step into that version of you, bit by bit, breath by breath. Make it natural.

# Step 2: Your 3 Anchors to Stay in That Identity

# 1. End-State Anchoring, Feel It in Your Bones

Keep asking: “How would the version of me who already has this… stand, talk, text, breathe?”

* Straighten your back.
* Catch your inner talk and make it match your dream self.
* Drop words like “trying,” use “it’s done,” “I’m ready,” “it’s unfolding.”

Example affirmation to carry with you:  
“Everything is unfolding beautifully for me.”

Feel it. Let it sink into your muscles, your face, your posture. The version of you that’s living their dream doesn’t need to rush.

# 2. Inner Mood Maintenance - Your Mood is the Magnet

Your energy is what life listens to. Think: how does the version of you who *has it* feel most of the day? Calm? Grateful? Light?

So today, your focus isn’t just on moments of happiness, but on creating an **emotional home** in your dream life.

Gentle reminder:  
When doubts pop up (and they will), you don’t fight them. You simply notice and softly say, “That’s the old me… but I’m choosing again.”

Mood is a choice, not a task. And your new self feels good more often than not.

# 3. Conscious Reaction Practice, Where You Grow the Fastest

Here’s where real growth happens.  
Something annoying happens, an unexpected bill, a text left on read.  
Old you: panic, overthink.  
New you: pause… observe… choose differently.

The magic trick:  
Whenever you feel triggered, ask:  
“How does the version of me who already has this respond?”

That moment of choice will become your superpower.

Before touching your phone, stand tall in the mirror. Look into your eyes.  
“Today, I’m living as the version of me who already has \[desire\].”

Feel it. Visualise it for just 2 minutes. Smile like it’s happening now. End with:  
“I allow it. I accept it. I am it.”  
Simple. Quick. Powerful.

# Midday Self-Check-In

Halfway through the day, check yourself, not to judge but to lovingly guide yourself back.  
“Who am I being right now?”

If you slipped, it’s okay. Smile. Shift. Choose again.

# Evening Gratitude & Identity Anchoring

At night, write down three things where you stayed aligned, even if it’s just remembering once! Progress is progress.  
Then write a short thank you note to your future self:  
“Thank you for leading us through this shift.”  
Fall asleep in your dream energy. Let your subconscious carry it through the night.

# Step 4: How to Hold the State Even When “Nothing Happens”

# Key Truth:

“Nothing happening” is an illusion.  
Energy rearranges behind the scenes even when you don’t see it. Your job is to hold the energy steady.

# Let’s be honest, sometimes, reality stays still. Nothing seems to happen.

This is where most people spiral.  
But not you. Because now you understand:  
“Quiet doesn’t mean nothing is happening. It means things are rearranging behind the scenes.”

Like a seed underground. Your job is to **hold your state**, not look for instant proof.

Here’s how to hold your state:

* Whisper “Regardless” when things wobble. “Regardless of what I see, it’s working.”
* Journal from your future. “It felt so natural when it arrived.”
* Focus more on your mood than external proof.
* Celebrate your inner shifts, they’re just as valuable as physical signs.

# Step 5: Let Go of “When” and “How” Fall in Love with Trust

Letting go doesn’t mean giving up, it means releasing the pressure. It means relaxing into knowing.

It sounds like:  
“It’s mine. I don’t need to hover over it. I’m going to enjoy life while it arrives.”

Reminder:  
You don’t manifest with force. You manifest with **flow**.  
Your energy is your invitation. Calm trust is magnetic.

# Step 6: Celebration - Your Secret Shortcut

Why wait to celebrate after it arrives? Celebrate now.  
Feel the joy now.  
This flips your energy from lack to abundance instantly.

Easy ways to celebrate:

* Morning thank-you’s as if it’s done.
* Smile after small wins and whisper: “I’m showing up for my dream life.”
* Walk taller, dress better, dance more, because you know it’s done.
* Before bed, imagine the celebration moment: the call, the message, the breakthrough.

The universe responds fastest to those who live from joy, not waiting for life to give permission.

# Gentle Closing Reminder:

The old you might pop up. That’s okay.  
You might wobble. That’s okay.  
Just… keep… returning… home.

Today you don’t chase.  
Today you don’t beg.  
Today you live as the person who already has it.  
And life will catch up to *who you decide to be*.



# Beyond the 72 Hours, This is How You Make It a Lifestyle

The first 72 hours after setting an intention are like fireworks, exciting, charged with energy, and full of possibility. But the real transformation happens after the excitement fades. This phase is what separates people who give up from those who step into a life where their desires unfold naturally. This is where you shift from “hoping” to *knowing*.

**The Goal After 72 Hours**

It’s not about manifesting just one thing. It’s about learning how to stay aligned with your desires every day, so life keeps flowing in your favor. You become someone who attracts effortlessly again and again.

**What to Do After the 72-Hour Window**

Life goes on after the 72 hours: work, chores, bills, people, it’s all still there. But ***you*** have changed. You’ve planted the seed of your desire.

You wouldn’t dig up a seed to see if it’s growing, right? You nurture it. You trust it will bloom.

This next phase is about:

* Keeping your mindset clean and supportive
* Maintaining the *“it’s already done”* feeling
* Not obsessing about when it will happen
* Letting your actions come from certainty, not lack

**How to Live in Alignment Daily**

You live your regular life, but from a stronger, calmer inner energy. You talk, laugh, work, but you’re not chasing, you’re **attracting**.

**Example**:  
If you’ve asked for a new job, you no longer obsessively check emails. You show up confidently in your current role, knowing something better is already yours. You take action from a sense of power, not panic.

The more you live in this energy, the easier life flows. You stop chasing, life starts chasing you.

**What If You Have a Bad Day?**

Yes, you’ll have off days. It’s normal.

**Key truth**: Wobbling is not failure. It’s part of your growth. Each time you realign, you get stronger. Think of it like learning to ride a bicycle: at first, you fall often, then less, then barely ever.

# What To Do When You Wobble:

1. **Pause** \- Don’t spiral. Simply notice, “I’m feeling off, that’s okay.”
2. **Zoom Out** \- This emotion is temporary. Your desire is still coming.
3. **Re-anchor** \- Use your tools (affirmations, breathwork, visualizations) to reconnect.

Falling off track doesn’t reset your desire. You don’t lose progress. You just get back on track with more ease each time.

**Daily Anchors to Stay Aligned**

Daily anchors are small, effortless rituals that pull you back into alignment. They don’t need to be complicated, they just need to feel good.

**Morning Ritual**

Before you even get out of bed, whisper:

Or visualize for 2 minutes.

# Identity Check-ins

Ask during the day:

Let your actions reflect your future self.

**Evening Gratitude**

At night, write:

* 3 things you appreciated
* 1 gratitude for your desire already being done:

# Visual Anchors

Use wallpapers, jewellery, or sticky notes as visual reminders of your desire.

Movement Anchors

Shift energy with your body:

* Power poses
* Confident walking
* Dancing with joy

Movement shifts your frequency faster than thinking!

**Building Momentum: The Secret Sauce**

Every time you stay aligned, you build momentum. Small shifts lead to bigger shifts. Your nervous system rewires. You go from feeling good for a few minutes… to a few hours… to an entirely new *normal*.

**Signs You’re Building Momentum:**

* You feel calm without forcing it
* Life flows more smoothly
* People treat you differently
* Random good news or synchronicities pop up
* You stop caring about “when” because you *know* it’s coming

The more you let go of checking, the faster your reality catches up.

**The Most Important Reminder**

Your job after 72 hours is NOT to chase the manifestation, it’s to nurture *alignment*.

When you do this:

* Desires show up more easily
* You feel grounded, no matter what
* You stay calm even when life gets noisy
* You bounce back faster from low moments

You become someone who naturally receives because you live in certainty.

# Final Thought:

Beyond 72 hours, it’s not just about what you get. It’s about ***who you become***. And the version of you who can hold alignment… is completely unstoppable.

Part 5","**Content Warning:** This story contains material that is not suitable for all audiences. Reader discretion is advised.

Part 5: Standing at the Edge of the World

 

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

I headed into the restaurant and told them my name for my reservation. To my surprise, she was already seated even though it was five minutes early. I smiled, and she returned it. I sat down and we ordered drinks.

The night was going well, and we talked about the usual things, the chaos of treatment in the back. She told me about how the front desk always had to keep owners calm or make update calls, keeping customers informed.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

Amanda said something, but she sounded so very far away. The entire world was drowned out; it was only me and the monster that now stood over me, its sagging flesh rippling in slow motion as it opened its mouth. I knew what was coming, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to brace myself for it.

It let out a shattering, piercing shriek which knocked me out of my chair. Every muscle in my body locked, and I felt paralyzed. The solid ground rushed up to meet me. I didn’t feel the impact, but I knew the wind had been knocked out of me. I looked at the Hollow, and its hands reached for me, its fingers outstretched toward me.

I couldn’t get a breath in; my chest felt like it was too heavy. I saw the corners of my vision start to turn black as I could feel the strain pulling me into unconsciousness. Within seconds, panic flooded over me, but I was powerless to do anything about it.

The last thing I saw before complete darkness was the inhuman, sagging, fleshy fingers of the Hollow reaching for me.

 

I woke up to the sound of music, my head pounding and…lights.

I realized my head was leaning against a glass pane.

A window? No, I was moving. I closed my eyes tight and opened them, trying to get my bearings. I was in a car, but I wasn’t the one driving. I looked over to the driver's side, and Amanda smiled at me, noticing I was finally awake.

“Well, good morning, sleeping beauty.” She greeted.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A fairly tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face that looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now. Tomorrow was another day, tomorrow I could figure out their secrets. For now, I needed to sleep.",1,1756960273.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

Here it is!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

Second off, I don't know anyone who ""glorifies"" it. There is a HUGe difference between ""you're beautiful and should make no effort at trying to be the healthiest version of you, you can be"" versus ""you're beautiful and you should stay the way you are even if it's harmful to your health!""

People are allowed to compliment an attractive person, they're allowed to say ""you're beautiful!"" and ""you don't need to follow societal standards!"" without encouraging people to be unhealthy.

Here's the thing most of y'all don't understand; it's safe to say nearly EVERY overweight person doesn't *want* to be overweight, and they've probably tried or are trying to get in shape. You don't know their life! 

They could; 
- have severe depression so their worry is to stay alive rather than healthy
- have tried hundreds of different weight lost plans but have low metabolism and genetics that make it harder to lose weight
- have already gone from like 400lb to 300lb and working on losing more 
- actually be healthy but larger than societal standards which makes you think they need to lose more. 

You don't know what the situation is for another person and you have absolutely NO right to be rude, judgemental, critical and ignorant to that fact. It's so much easier to just ignore them than to bully them about a fat I guarantee they already know. You aren't fucking Sherlock Holmes, chances are they KNOW they are out of shape, every person on the Internet, rude stranger in a coffee shop, doctor and rude great grandma that barely gets invited to family reunions let's them know that

TW: Drug use, drug addiction

Part 5: Standing at the Edge of the World

 

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

I headed into the restaurant and told them my name for my reservation. To my surprise, she was already seated even though it was five minutes early. I smiled, and she returned it. I sat down and we ordered drinks.

The night was going well, and we talked about the usual things, the chaos of treatment in the back. She told me about how the front desk always had to keep owners calm or make update calls, keeping customers informed.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

Amanda said something, but she sounded so very far away. The entire world was drowned out; it was only me and the monster that now stood over me, its sagging flesh rippling in slow motion as it opened its mouth. I knew what was coming, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to brace myself for it.

It let out a shattering, piercing shriek which knocked me out of my chair. Every muscle in my body locked, and I felt paralyzed. The solid ground rushed up to meet me. I didn’t feel the impact, but I knew the wind had been knocked out of me. I looked at the Hollow, and its hands reached for me, its fingers outstretched toward me.

I couldn’t get a breath in; my chest felt like it was too heavy. I saw the corners of my vision start to turn black as I could feel the strain pulling me into unconsciousness. Within seconds, panic flooded over me, but I was powerless to do anything about it.

The last thing I saw before complete darkness was the inhuman, sagging, fleshy fingers of the Hollow reaching for me.

 

I woke up to the sound of music, my head pounding and…lights.

I realized my head was leaning against a glass pane.

A window? No, I was moving. I closed my eyes tight and opened them, trying to get my bearings. I was in a car, but I wasn’t the one driving. I looked over to the driver's side, and Amanda smiled at me, noticing I was finally awake.

“Well, good morning, sleeping beauty.” She greeted.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A fairly tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face that looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now.

On one hand, you get the chance to explore a new place and meet different teams, but on the other, you’re stepping into an unfamiliar environment where you’ll need to adapt quickly.

One of the first things I’d suggest is getting comfortable with the facility’s policies and procedures before you start. Every hospital or clinic has its own way of doing things, so reviewing guidelines and asking questions early on can save a lot of confusion later.

Packing smart is another big one. Beyond the usual scrubs and essentials, bring a few personal items that make you feel grounded—whether that’s your favorite coffee mug, a journal, or something small from home. These little comforts can make a temporary assignment feel more stable.

Another tip is connecting with other travel nurses online. They often share great insights on housing, schedules, and managing the emotional ups and downs.

Some nurses also use resources like The Student Helpline for assignment-related guidance and time management strategies. Having extra academic or organizational support can be reassuring, especially if you’re juggling further studies while on assignment.",1,1756959660.0,studying,0,1.0,False

So it's Saturday before last, and my day is busy as shite. First thing in the morning is biking to Milpitas BART to catch a train to Fremont for a coffee date. Then, it's back on BART to head down to San Jose for a lunch date. I'm a current SJSU student, so I lock my bike in the on-campus bike lockup area, which I have an access fob to. And then after that concludes, it's back to BART and up to Berkeley, where I cyclocross-carry my bike out of the station and do a threshold effort to the pizzeria where my band is waiting for me to hit downbeat. I get behind the keyboard with five minutes to spare, and the show, miraculously, goes off without a hitch. Afterwards, we pack up, I hand off my keyboard to our drummer (we share an apartment, #justmusicianthings) and bike back to the station to head home to Milpitas. When I get home, a car comes through the garage gate ahead of me and I just ride in behind, and I get to the apartment right after drumguy does, so the door is unlocked.

Next morning, I'm getting set to ride to... somewhere, I forget, and can't find my keys. This is not as bad news as it would be if I had a studio apartment to myself, but it's still pretty bad: I just got a keyed U-lock for the express purpose of keeping it at the campus lockup so I wouldn't have to carry it around and could reserve my heavy-ass chain lock for other purposes, and like an idiot, I'd left both of the keys that came with it on my keyring rather than sticking one of them in my desk or something for safekeeping. So even if I was able to replace the fob to enter the campus lockup, my brand new U-lock was now useless to me. My keyring also had a bottle opener, remains of my first bike lock key that broke off in the lock nine years ago that I kept around as an impromptu (bad) box cutter and reminder that it can always get worse, and, most troublingly, a handmade leather guitar pick pouch that a former student of mine gave me for Christmas a few years ago. Everything else was going to be possible, if annoying, to replace, but that one was a gut punch. So I retrace my steps, call the campus and BART lost and founds and the band's contact at the pizzeria, and there's no sign of them.

Let me back up a bit. I have a drawstring backpack that I use for most things. It's lightweight, reasonably breathable for use on the bike, and it has two external pockets besides the main compartment: an orange one on the back that velcros shut, plus a blue one on the front that doesn't. So I have a few things that I keep in the orange pocket, like a multitool, tire lever, spare tube, mini pump, phone charger, and, yes, my keys. The last time I for sure had them was when I finished my second date and grabbed my bike out of the campus bike lockup, but I was dead certain I remembered reaching around and sticking them in the orange rear pocket, just like I always do. Foreshadowing is a literary device in which--

I replace the apartment key, the bike lockup fob, and the bottle opener, and lug my heavy-ass chain lock down to campus. I also order a new combination U-lock, then, while attempting to set the combination, accidentally set it to something random and lock myself out of it. Pricey week, but I get my essentials covered.

Today, I got home from a grocery run and was in the middle of unloading my groceries when I noticed there seemed to be something else in my backpack. So I go fishing around, and find that whatever it is is in the blue front pocket.

It's my keys. They were in the blue front pocket for a week and a half of me thinking they'd evaporated.

My other housemate assures me that he is going to tell all of his coworkers about this tomorrow, and they are all going to laugh very hard. I told him to please relay their best roasts of my dumb ass.

Neither of the dates went anywhere.

**TLDR: lost my keys, replaced them, then they were literally just in the wrong pocket of my regular backpack**",2,1756959622.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False
