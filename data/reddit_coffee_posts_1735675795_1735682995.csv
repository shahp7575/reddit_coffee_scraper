Start the Year with These Steps! ✨"" 🎉","[🌟 Your dream home is closer than you think! 🌞 Manifest your perfect space in 2025 with clear intentions, inspired action, and a little magic. 🏡✨ What does your dream home look like? Let us know below! 👇](https://preview.redd.it/nv3tbtvzb9ae1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=9045a1cc2b2fe61549c44644ea8012deb70cddd4)

As we step into 2025, it’s the perfect time to set intentions and start manifesting your dream home. 🎯 Whether you're a first-time homebuyer or just thinking about taking that big step, aligning your mindset and actions is key to success. Inspired by Abraham Hicks, here’s how you can start the new year strong:

1️⃣ **Get Clear on Your 'Why':**  
Take some time to journal or visualize why owning a home is important to you. Write down your 'why' and craft a powerful statement that affirms your vision. For example:  
*""I am now a proud homeowner, owning a home that meets all my needs and wants.""* 🏠💭  
This solidifies your intention and connects you emotionally to your goal.

2️⃣ **Release Fears and Build Confidence:**  
Replace doubts like, “I can’t afford it,” with affirmations like, “The resources I need will appear as I take action.” 🌈✨💪 Pro tip: Appreciation is a game-changer! 🙌

3️⃣ **Be Thankful and Embrace the Journey:**  
When you focus on appreciation for what you want to have happen — and embrace every step of the process — you speed up the manifestation. 🎉 Celebrate where you are now while holding the vision of what’s coming. 🌟💖

4️⃣ **Take Practical Steps:**  
Although it seems counter-intuitive, talking with a mortgage advisor is the first step to getting ready to be ready to buy a home. 🏦📋 A good mortgage lender will give you a step-by-step action plan to help you understand your options and prepare financially. You can start with a free discovery call at [https://talkingwithamy.com](https://talkingwithamy.com) to begin your journey. This step makes everything feel REAL! 🛠️💼

5️⃣ **Stay Aligned with Your Vision:**  
Get even clearer on your vision of where you want to buy a home. Visualize the neighborhood, the local parks 🌳, or the nearby coffee shop ☕ where you’ll spend your mornings. Each detail you imagine brings you closer to your end goal of owning a home. 🏡✨ Take small, consistent steps like saving for a down payment or researching neighborhoods that match your vision.

6️⃣ **Trust the Process:**  
Celebrate every milestone along the way, no matter how small, and know that your dream home is getting closer every day. 🥂🎊

🌟 *Appreciation, emotional alignment, and inspired action create a powerful combo to manifest your dream home faster.* 🌟

Let’s make 2025 the year you step into homeownership! 🏠✨ What’s your biggest goal for the new year? Drop your thoughts below — let’s manifest together! 🎉💭

Happy New Year! 🎆🎇

I’m returning it tomorrow but I’m just curious as to if I did something wrong or it was just faulty? Asus manual suggests using the AIO pump connector with the fans in the CPU_fan and CPU_opt and the manual for the kraken suggests to daisy chain both fans into the attached splitter and connect that to CPU_fan. I feel like a dummy because I’ve built computers—my son and mine—and yet I am stumped what to do with this aio. Also, With asus mobos in particular not having anything in the cpu_fan connector gives an error message and I know how to disable that in the bios but I also don’t want to play around with things I’m not sure what’s going on.

1hqp197,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqp197,"SingleThread (***) - Healdsburg, CA","We stayed a couple of nights at SingleThread for a year-end trip, wanted to do the full experience (inn stay + shabu + dinner), and what an experience it was. The hospitality is beyond incredible, the staff are amazing, friendly and accommodating, and you’re taken care of from start to finish. I have even more pictures of other aspects of the Inn stay but hit the upload limit lol. 

Dinner at the restaurant was phenomenal. I saw some comments before saying the Japanese breakfast is even better but I didn’t find that to be the case for my taste, not to say the breakfast wasn’t delicious as well. That salmon is to die for. The in-room shabu donabe dinner is very mild and all about highlighting the ingredients. It’s definitely veggie heavy so if your party is made up of primarily meat eaters or have a heavy palate, I would skip. It is also a full service meal where someone will be in and out serving each course etc.

The 10-course tasting menu:

1. Early Winter In Sonoma—small bites, there were so many starting with a shigoku oyster, various sashimi, sesame tofu, and 3 warm bites of SB uni chawanmushi, cod, and another fish I forgot the name of

2. Sawara, hibiscus, kanpyo, pomegranate, bone tare

3. Aka amadai with crispy scales, cauliflower dashi, wasabina, yuba, preserved lemon

4. Duck liver parfait salad with black apple, brown butter, salanova lettuce

5. Hokkaido scallop katsu-inspired lightly fried in nori with malted candy roaster, Petaluma chanterelle, Burgundy truffle, caramelized scallop jus

6. Buddha’s hand, Preston olive oil, black tea and Douglas fir jellies

7. Duclair duck & Miyazaki A5 wagyu ($90 supplement), trio of cabbage, roasted garlic-miso sabayon, farm prune preserves

8. Luna koshikari porridge shime with wagyu short rib, smoked American chestnut, Piracicaba broccoli

9. Sunchoke & cacao, Lydgate Farms vanilla, buttermilk, brownie

10. Wagashi of Meyer lemon verjus blanc in a white chocolate eggshell, Kintoki carrot frozen custard and mokum tops, mochi and miso, and eggnog and mace

Take-home is a packet of komatsuna seeds (traditional Japanese leafy green vegetable)

We chose not to do the wine pairing and instead opted for sake since I saw they have a sake subscription program. The sommelier, Matt, chose two wonderful picks based on our request.

Inn breakfasts with a la carte options:

Sonoma breakfast—chanterelle and honeynut squash poached egg, pomme rosti with black truffle and creme fraiche (bougie tots are bomb), house-made Cumberland sausage, beet and goat cheese salad, crumpet with butter and jam

Japanese breakfast—miso grilled salmon, Luna rice with pumpkin and habanada pepper, broccolini goma dare, spicy glazed kabocha, dashimaki tamago, tsukemono, yudofu miso soup with Ohitashi farm greens

Addons:

1. Black trumpet mushroom omelette with negi  and goma

2. Japanese souffle pancakes with apple compote and whipped cream

3. Fuyu persimmon toast with ricotta, citrus, pecan

4. Journeyman Meats barrel-smoked bacon

You can choose one of the set meals and add on any other items if you wish, including fresh orange juice, smoothie, coffee and tea. 

Shabu:

1. Started off with miniature version of dinner’s first course—grilled shima aji(?) collar, mini tuna taco in a nori and nasturtium shell, chanterelle tempura, yuba and fuyu persimmon, cured salmon

2. Kinmedai with Kintoki carrots & other farm vegetables

3. Wagyu beef, assortment of vegetables from their farm, myoga, celtuce

4. Fuyu persimmon sticky toffee pudding and a burnt orange custard

All of their meals feature primarily ST grown produce or ultra-locally sourced products from other farms. 

Some quick Inn info: I think they have activities at their Farm just down the road if you ask/plan ahead of time but we wanted to explore the area on our own. We did stop by the Farm and they let us walk around on our own. Audi Q4 and Q8 e-trons available to reserve for use and great for visiting nearby wineries. Complimentary room service of half-dozen oysters, charcuterie, cheese, crudités, and matcha or espresso affogato. Additional charge for caviar and champagne.

1hqoxkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAIV/comments/1hqoxkx/this_game_wasnt_a_radically_different_direction/,This game wasn't a radically different direction like some people admit,"I wanna debunk the claim that GTA 4 was a completely new direction for the series or that the game is not very ""GTA-like""

GTA 4 is often criticized for having missions that go like ""Drive here and kill someone"" and not much variety. First off, this model of missions seems more akin to that of GTA 3 rather than Vice City or San Andreas, it may come off as monotone if you look at it as surface level as driving somewhere and killing the objective, but this is a game that doesn't put much restrictions in how you approach said objective. You may argue that Vice City, 4 and San Andreas have more variety and wacky missions, but the missions in 4 are more like those in 3 where they focus more on simple objectives with more sandbox-y approaches to said objective, it's not to say the ps2 era didn't have them, but GTA 4 in general has a more emergent gameplay and more free-form missions so it's a lot more apparent, the missions focus more on making the most out of the core gameplay of this game, rather than being gimmicky fun that, while fun on the first playthrough, it doesn't have much replayability.

""GTA 4's missions are a lot more serious, they aren't as wacky fun or action packed as previous games""

First off, GTA 4 has action packed missions, the difference is that they take their time to build up unlike GTA 5 which usually loves to throw you into huge, over the top missions filled with wacky action. I am not saying these missions aren't fun but having them be so constant through the story makes them less impressive and quite dull honestly, specially how scripted some of these can be, even The Ballad of Gay Tony deviates from the more free-form missions of base IV and TLaD, not to say they are bad, but you can tell how much this DLC wanted to go back to the more wacky missions, it honestly feels more like a showcase of new additions but doesn't make the most of it during it's missions. 

Going back to base IV, the more action packed missions have a build up, before Three Leaf Clover, getting to know Packie and his crew and doing missions for him before the big score finally hits, Hostile Negotiation is all sudden yet before that you get calls from Mallorie worried about Roman and the guy doesn't answer the phone anymore until you finally get the message from Dimitri, Late Checkout is this John Wick-type shootout that is the culmination of the Diamonds deal, following up the shootout at the Museum. There's also a mission where you have to chase an helicopter with Jacob high on weed trying to shoot it with a rocket launcher, a mission that happens later on after working for the U.L paper, as well as the mission where you give Gracie back to Tony and Luis after going through a whole quest contacting Gracie, kidnapping her, and then the ransom. And who says GTA 4 can't be over the top? The last mission literally has you jumping off a ramp with a bike to catch an helicopter for christ sake.

Sure, GTA 4 isn't as gimmicky as some other GTA games but like I said, this game focuses more on it's very core gameplay and has a much more dynamic mission design with just that rather than trying to do something more scripted and step to step, something as simple as shootouts varies a lot, Hostile Negotiation, in case you take the normal route, has you going all the way up, with Niko at a disadvantage trying to go all the way up unless you grab an helicopter where the shootout has Niko on top yet it's also more difficult to get there. You have to rescue your gambling addict cousin from a mob of russians after being kidnapped and the mission ends with Roman being scolded over his gambling addiction, if you ask me this is very over the top, not wacky, but still over the top, and it feels like it resembles more the type of missions GTA 3 had rather than the rest of games, there's a reason It's called GTA 4 and not ""Liberty City"" or something else, it is actually a follow up to that game in terms of gameplay, tone, visuals, and missions.

Even the map is a remake of the Liberty City we saw in GTA 3, some people complain that about the cold visuals (not just the filter) and the map of GTA 4 being all city when... That's exactly what GTA 3 was also like, if that's the case then why is this game labeled as a deviation despite being a return to form? The Ballad of Gay Tony was the actual follow up to San Andreas people begged for, the base game was the true successor to GTA 3.

People also complain about the sandbox of GTA 4 not having as many activities as San Andreas, and like I said before, this game aimed to have a much more emergent gameplay, better core gameplay and more intricate map design and mechanics that let the player be more creative with what the game offers, at the end of the day, the sandbox ends up being more fun than San Andreas because, despite having less activities, you can do more in the environment the game presents you with, while San Andreas isn't as mechanically in-depth, and GTA 5 is a middle point between the two that doesn't excel at anything honestly.

Last point I wanna cover is the popular claim that GTA 4 is all grim and dark and so serious. Guys, the very first mission of the game has the iconic ""Big titties"" line, Roman falling asleep while Niko talks about the horrors of his life and then spitting the coffee claiming it tasted like if a rat shat on it. Of course the game's story is darker than the previous games but to claim it's this super serious, Godfather-like story is false, the comedy in this game is still very present, it's just more subtle, and to add to the world of GTA 4 in general, if you still don't believe me, take a moment to listen to the radio, listen to just 10 seconds of Lazlow if you're still convinced this game doesn't have that much outlandish humour.

So yeah, while GTA 4 was a big step forward for the series it also returned back to basics in a way, I don't think this game is as ridiculously serious as some think nor do I think the mission structure and design is monotone like some claim, GTA 4 is a slower game, it takes It's time but the payoff is big, and it's mechanics are more depthful and skill-based making this game feel slower because the player takes more time to adjust to it. I can understand why people prefer the more arcadey and outlandish fun of San Andreas and Vice City, to say this game is not really a GTA? I disagree, heavily. This franchise has always been a satire, a mockery of American society and culture, and if anything I cannot think of another game that excels at it than this one.",1,1735681958.0,GTAIV,1,1.0,False

No-one has taught me how to make tea. My parents don't drink tea and both my great grandparents and my grandparents are dead so I can't ask them. 

For the longest time, I've made my tea in the microwave. (Put the tea bag in, then added water, and then into the microwave it goes.)

I’m a young, fun, and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 34, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

If you would be interested in chatting and meeting up for coffee or brunch, feel free to shoot me a message!

2024 gave us mace and I will be forever grateful that I noticed him outside the waiting room window and asked to meet him even after my husband told me not to lol. The moment I met him he climbed into my lap and I just knew he was my dog. The best wedding present ever! While he came to me with a lot of issues I'm so grateful it was me that adopted him and that I was fully prepared to deal with his issues and not someone else who couldn't and would have had to return him.

Muzzle training mace was game changing for us and it's insane to look back at when we first got him vs now and to think that so much of that change is down to a muzzle! He is literally a different dog and I'm grateful every day that I made this choice. 

People can look at him and judge me for muzzling him but they weren't there when he bit my husband with very little warning because of how terrified he was of us, they weren't there when he would lunge and bark at dogs and nearly pull his leash out of my hand or nearly pull me over every single walk to the point id come home crying because i was terrified of dropping his leash and him hurting another dog, they weren't there when he shot at a toad before I could stop him and ate it and i thought he was dying because he was foaming and salavating every where like someone had turned the tap on inside his mouth, they weren't there when he lunged at a child and his collar broke on me (luckily I had a slip leash on 😭).

He wears a muzzle for so many reasons and a lot of these things happened early on and like I said he's like a different dog now but that's only because I made the decision to be a responsible dog owner and acknowledge that my dog is not 100% safe and needed a muzzle. We have spent months training and he has not bitten anyone since and his confidence is insane now! Every morning he goes to the coffee shop on his walk and gets a treat/pup cup from the sweet ladies all while they tell him how handsome and well behaved he is. People stop me to tell me how cute he is even when muzzled, He can walk past children completley unbothered, and his threshold and ability to walk away from dogs had massively improved. He also can't eat toads!! I don't think any of this would have been possible without his muzzle. Mace will never be 100% and able to be out without a muzzle but that's okay because i made sure to get him one that fits correctly and allows him to still be a dog and he looks absolutely adorable in it. 🥰

You are all amazing dog owners and I have so much respect for all of you for also being responsible and muzzling your dog 💚 your dog is so lucky to have you and do not let anyone tell you anything different. Your dog deserves to be a dog and if a muzzle is what allows them that then keep doing what you are doing!

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am .

I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week .

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
- a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings

The workers placed us in our gowns and put hot water in the herbs, and we were left to our own devices for an hour. No where before hand did it say gratuity was included and this was a big day spa. You pay in advance for tickets and then for any additional costs you pay before leaving. When it is time for me to pay, I see the added gratuity and I ask them to take it off. They ask why and I said it wasn’t stated beforehand so I’m not paying for it. They then doubled down asking why again because “they had to put the reason in the system” and I just repeated that I didn’t want to pay for it and that WAS the reason. They took it off and when my friend went to pay, it was on hers as well. She didn’t ask them to remove it and when I asked her why, she said it wasn’t worth the conversation. The added gratuity was close to $20, so to me a 2 minute conversation was totally worth the money. This was this summer and at the time I was a pretty generous tipper. That one event has completely changed how I view tipping now. I don’t tip at coffee shops, picking up food from restaurants, ordering food at counters, etc. any more. A lot of people say on this sub that greed is why they stopped tipping and that’s exactly what I experienced at this day spa. ",12,1735680959.0,tipping,0,0.93,False

The results might just blow your mind.**

I’ve been experimenting with combining IF and keto, and I want to share everything I’ve learned about maximizing results with these two powerful approaches. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of how to implement both successfully.

***If you live in Philadelphia PA or Bucks County PA and need help losing weight call*** [Medical Weight Loss Philadelphia ](https://wakeupskinny.com/)***at 215-821-7336 or visit online at***[ https://wakeupskinny.com/](https://wakeupskinny.com/)   ***and learn about their medically supervised weight loss program.***

**Why Combine IF with Keto?**The science is fascinating - when you combine these approaches, they work synergistically. Keto already puts your body in fat-burning mode, but IF accelerates this by keeping insulin levels low and extending fat-burning periods. Plus, during fasting, your cells undergo autophagy (cellular cleanup), promoting better overall health.

**Common Fasting Schedules:**

*16/8 Method (Best for Beginners)*

* Fast for 16 hours, eat within 8-hour window
* Example: First meal at 12 PM, last meal by 8 PM
* Perfect for easing into fasting while maintaining keto
* Stay hydrated with water, tea, coffee during fasting

*18/6 Method (Intermediate)*

* Fast for 18 hours, eat within 6-hour window
* Example: First meal at 1 PM, last meal by 7 PM
* Great for experienced keto-ers wanting to boost results
* Focus on hydration during fasting periods

*24-Hour Fast (Advanced)*

* One meal per 24-hour period
* Example: Dinner to dinner fasting
* IMPORTANT: Must consult healthcare provider first
* Don’t start here - work up to it gradually
* Promotes deeper ketosis and autophagy

**What to Eat During Feeding Windows:**

*Sample Meals:*

* Breakfast: Keto omelet (eggs, spinach, avocado, cheese in butter)
* Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with avocado and olive oil
* Dinner: Baked salmon with garlic, zucchini noodles

1hqokry,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1hqokry/happy_new_year_celebrating_it_in_germany_tonight/,Happy New Year! Celebrating it in Germany tonight.,"I am in an unspecified German city for certain reasons, and it was unexpected that I would be celebrating it here alone with my girlfriend's dog instead of at home in Sweden. Btw I am not in Bielefeld, that city does not exist.

I met up with three strangers-turned-friends who also sought to live a long, happy, and sober life like I am also trying to achieve for myself. We had a little meeting, and gosh it was so humiliating to speak in German which I had not practiced in so many years.

But I felt so open at the same time. Here I was admitting to people that I am a young alcohol abuser, that I needed other people to point out to me that I needed help, and also that I discovered during my sobriety many more things about my mental health and my personal life, the most prominent one is me discovering and admitting I am a trans woman.

I was praised by one person, impressed that despite the language barrier and me being new to the meeting, that I could be so open! I answered ""oh well I'm not here next week, so if it turned out that you all were bigots, you won't see me again anyways""

Before the meeting ended, I wished them all a happy Silvesterabend, and thanked them, not exaggerating, that they saved my life tonight.

My review of that meeting would be ""I thought Germans were more formal and rule-bound. This one, the only rules were the 12 steps and traditions, otherwise it's just like another coffee-and-biscuits small chat. I like it!""

See y'all in 2025! I hope y'all live long and happy lives, no matter what.

I was having terrible diarrhea and stomach pain. I took a week off (not intentional, plans didn’t line up, but maybe the unintentional break was much needed). I took the shot last night and I was fine into the next day, up until a few hours ago, where I was experiencing diarrhea and stomach pain. I haven’t eaten anything today, but last night I had chipotle and a chocolate bar. Not a good choice. I know. 

But for the first time since I was a child I vomited. It was brown and had chunky particles. The stomach pain turned very very mild immediately after. 


Google tells me if it looks like coffee grounds is a bad sign. This is so disgusting I’m sorry but mine looked like diarrhea with chunks, I’m going to go to urgent care tomorrow, even if this isn’t bad they can at least give me some anti nausea meds.

1hqof8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1hqof8o/im_done_with_my_bestfriend/,I'M DONE WITH MY BESTFRIEND,"I 25M have been friends with this girl 26F for more than a decade now. Early in the friendship it became obvious she's the very introverted type but it wasn't much of a problem for me. I think it was more of a minor inconvenience that she would dissappear for a few days and not text back or not want to do stuff. Obviously it was her time and I didn't want to be needy and besides as teens I had other friends so it was one of those quirks you accept about someone. 

Now fast forward more than 10 years later we're grown adult. We both have real problems, real bills to pay, social dynamics to navigate and obviously as it happens your social circle gets smaller through time but her and I have remained close friends and in contact. The problem is that I feel like I'm the only one pulling any weight in this friendship at this point.

 Whenever she texts me with something I respond so that she can vent and talk. Whenever she needs a favor I'm there, Whenever she has a birthday or holiday I'm there. But when something happened in my life that I want to vent about the only possible way I can vent about it if I send a cold message pouring my heart out because i literally can't hold it in anymore because I can't get the chance to bring it up naturally into casual conversation at all. When it's about her we can text for hours but when it's suddenly about me I'd he lucky if I get a text back the same day. I moved states and still make time to atleast send her a birthday card for her birthday in the years since I left I haven't gotten a single thing for my birthday from here. Other people ATLEAST send birthday cards. 

I'm honestly not even asking for her to be available 24/7 no is and there's days that you just can't and don't want to talk but damn I honestly feel that I'm not asking for anything crazy just some minor effort from to time some display of care aside from here telling me she does. 

I have brought this up multiple time and all she says is that she was busy or she was depressed and that she cares but guess what? I'M DEPRESSED TOO I HAVE PROBLEMS TOO and sure I can superficially vent to maybe some coworkers or some friends of convenience but she's one of my oldest friends who's my age and who should have most of the context. Why should I have to? 

The straw the broke the camels back was the other day. I have been off state for many years now and haven't seen her for a while when I got back in town I wanted to hang out, nothing major or expensive just talk and catch up in person for a change maybe and hour or two but all I got while I was there were excuses or ignored messages. Again with the presumptive explanation that she's probably depressed or busy with family or didn't check her phone.

All I wanted was to maybe get some coffee. It's literally been years. You'd think she could spare an hour.

I lay it all out, plates, coffee, etc. the ex eats the bagel, makes a giant mess and leaves trash, then walks back to my bed. Then 10 minutes later is like “can I have your bagel?” And I’m like “no??” Then 10 minutes later I say “yeah you can have it if you pick up your mess” and he says “well I want to enjoy myself though?” Like fully just expecting to leave his mess. Mind you it’s trash that’s 7 inches away from the trash can and all he has to do is put it in there. So I traded him half my bagel for him to clean up after himself. Then he gets pissed that I ate my OWN OTHER HALF TO MY BAGEL saying “you should have given to me for putting my trash away!” And he’s like nonchalant yet means every word of it.

I'm looking for a particular PC game from my early childhood. It was likely made in the late 90s or early 2000s if I had to guess. I played an awful lot of education games (jumpstart, blues clues, pencil pals, etc) so I really can't be sure where it was from.

The main game was made up of different minigames. I want to say that it's based in a school, and you could click on different classrooms down a hallway. I think it had videos as well, I maybe remember one centered around John Henry.

The minigame in particular I'm looking for has I believe a lizard(?) as a mascot. I want to say you were either a spy or detective trying to make suspects comfortable while you interrogate them.  
  
In this game, to the right was a bust of a character. The only one I remember was a southern cowgirl type lady. I recall that when you help her, she says something along the lines of feeling better than a ""wet dog on a hot dock""  
They had different dialogues, but their expression and condition would also change to show you what they needed.

You could help them via a large panel to the left. You could get them different drinks ie water, lemonade, coffee, etc. I believe there were similar variations for food. You could also make the room hotter or colder.

1hqoati,https://www.reddit.com/r/tasmania/comments/1hqoati/aurora_energy_solar/,Aurora Energy - Solar,"I had solar installed a month ago - 2nd December. TasNetworks notified on the 3rd December that the Solar Feed-in Tarrif 140 had been configured in the meter. 

Has anyone else had solar installed recently, and how did your Aurora experience go?

The Aurora+ app / website still doesn’t show any solar data. I had to call then a bajillion times to even have them fix something so the solar related fields show up, but still no data, I’m still being charged for electricity, and I’m generating two or three times more solar than what I use. 

I’ve been hung up on, told to wait longer, told to wait a week, told to wait 10 days, told to wait 20 days. 

I realise I can come across as an arrogant f’ing c… over the phone from time to time, but when you’ve worked in call centres before, in a technical role, level 1 and level 2 support, and regularly been given tickets to follow up where a customer has had an ongoing issue for too-long and I’ve been tasked with getting the issue resolved…

And then you call Aurora and the call centre staff are responding to things you didn’t say, responding to things that’ve have already happened, or aren’t happening, have you’ve explained the scenario four times, and you’re a tradesperson so you naturally swear like a Northern Queenslander - I always say “it’s part of my cultures dialect, you can’t discriminate against me” - but only in a light-hearted manner, and being sure to tell the call centre staff that my frustration isn’t directed at them personally…

Mostly recently, when I was told to wait another ten business days (two weeks), I started saying something along the lines of “right, so you, not you personally, but the organisation you represent, know there’s an issue, and your making it pretty clear to me that Aurora’s response is that they’ll do nothing, I’ll wait long, then call back again in two weeks and talk to another call centre agent, where I’ll have to explain the scenario nineteen more times to seven different people. Can you put me through to a team leader.”

Whereby I was told they can get a team leader call me back, and I’m like I’m happy to wait on hold, it could be twenty minutes or more, okay I’ll wait, I know there’s a team leader, or some sort of responsible agent / Level 2 support on duty, there always is, patch me through to the CEO of that’s what needs to happen… And so on and so forth.

Finally get put through to a team leader who discovers there’s an issue with my account / their billing system, and my account needs to be reset. So I’m like “righteo, pop me on hold, you call the billing team, get it sorted / ask them toe expedite” and she’s like “I can send them an email” and I’m like “they probably work on the same floor, or at least in the same building, just get off your arse and go talk to them” - I wasn’t that rude, but you get the idea - so she finally agrees to give them a call, she was wanking from home that day. She comes back 10 minutes later, where I promptly asked if she “made me a coffee too, because I figure this is the bit where you pop the customer on hold for a few minutes, go and make a coffee, get on the internal company chat and slag me to you colleagues”, we both a good laugh at that cos she obviously understood my sense of human, unlike the poor level 1 zombies who copped it prior.

This is where I was told it could take up to 20 days, and that was on the 18th of December if I recall correctly, so it’ll be 18th January by the time that particular set 20 days have elapsed.

The Aurora website[1] claims something about 15 days, that appears to be to have a new meter installed, but I already had a new solar feed-in compatible meter with the wireless telemetry installed three or more years ago prior to adding more heat pumps.

In before: I make no distinction between male / female / other call centre staff, I treat everyone the same over the phone, it’s laziness I get frustrated at. Incompetence is a different matter, and I don’t know how long someone’s been doing any particular job or task, their incompetence could just be a matter of fewer hours of experience, and that’s okay, I’ll just politely ask to speak to someone who knows what their doing.

Did I mention al the data is in the solar inverter, which appears to be configured correctly based on Aurora stating they can see there’s an issue in their billing system, and I can connect to the inverter via the branded apps and see the data / graphs / etc.

Did I also mention the day after my most recently call to them, the Aurora+ app sent me a notification saying something about some users may be experiencing usage data issues. So they either pushed that notification to my app only, or there’s a wider issue that maybe my phone calls contributed to them discovering. Who knows.

Congratulations if you’ve made it this far, my wife is away so there’s no-one here to mansplain at haha happy new beers.

How did 2024 go, plans for next year, etc.","I started tracking my income and spending in April of 2024 via Google Sheets, and it's been great starting to take control of my personal finances! I'd love for us to do a little bit of reflection together -- how did your 2024 go? What do you anticipate happening in 2025, and what do you want to change for next year?

**My background:** early 20s, full-time student in healthcare graduating in spring 2025, part-time job in healthcare and part-time musician

**What went well** (based on my April-December tracking)**:** the typical budget advice is the 50/30/20 rule (spend 50% of your total income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings/investments/debts). My actual breakdown was 37%/13%/50% -- 37% on wants, 13% on needs, and 50% on savings/investments!

I'm very lucky to have the super low cost of living I have right now; I go to school close to my parents (they love to bring me food), I live in inexpensive housing in a LCOL city which is likely the lowest rent I will ever pay in my life, and the car I drive is my dad's old car (AKA no car payments). I'm glad I took advantage of said advantages with how much I put in savings/investments.

I also really didn't spend a whole lot on going out to eat and what I dub ""little treats"" (coffees, drinks at bars, snacks, ice cream, etc.) as I come from a family that very, very rarely went out to eat and was very much so ""we have XYZ at home."" My monthly average was $66.16 for meals out and $30.23 for little treats.

**What to improve on:** I spent >$2000 on beauty and fashion. Granted, these are my biggest hobbies (just peep my Reddit history ha), but the fact that this was my biggest expense after savings/investments and rent/housing is wild!

I spent a decent amount of time volunteering/doing charitable work through school but didn't really donate much money.

**What I anticipate for 2025:** since I graduate and thus will be searching for my big girl healthcare job in 2025, things are really up in the air right now. I'm going an unconventional route with my career, so it's even more uncertain for me compared to my classmates, and it's hard to make any goals regarding savings. I just want to make sure I avoid lifestyle creep once I make real mullah.

*Rent/housing:* after my current lease ends, I'll likely move back in with my parents until I figure out my career stuff, which will save me a nice amount of money. That's especially good because ultimately, I want to live in an apartment downtown. For the places I'm interested in (which are very regular downtown apartments), the rent tends to be >2x my current rent -- plus I'll need to pay for apartment application fees, a security deposit, new furniture, etc. The silver livings for me are 1) I love secondhand home goods, and 2) with the power of God and anime on my side (i.e. my family), I won't need to pay for movers, storage space, etc.

*School/career*: Things related to my licensing exams and professional organizations total >$1500. What a tragedy it is that we have to spend this much money before we are even legally allowed to make the money.

Re: music, I want to buy a bass guitar! I also need to take in my main acoustic guitar to get fixed.

*Health*: as a reward for myself once I get a job, I want to get Invisalign.

*Beauty/fashion*: I want spend less money here and make a little through selling my clothes.

**Changes to how I'm tracking my money**: in my spreadsheet, my income sources will be different because of aforementioned graduation/big girl job. I'm also changing my ""school"" subcategory in the needs spending to healthcare career-related.

I'm separating my ""gifts/donations"" spending, which'll be helpful both for tax reasons and encouraging donations.

It felt like I wasn't really in control of my body when this was happening, and my heart rate was back to normal at this point. I will also add that I drank a coffee for the first time while on adderall, which could've contributed to the heart rate.

Taking both will only annoy people around you.","This morning, I headed and strolled by my local gyms to check for a spot. There are two right next to each other about two and a half blocks from my crib. It's about 75% residential 25% restaurants and parks so it's usually pretty predictable despite a lot of foot traffic.  

I noticed one gym was fresh, with three mon at around 1.5 hours, the other one was full but 16 hours with empty hearts.  

Obvious move, I swept the stale one with my Machamp and put in one of my beefy Blisseys before moving on.  

Less than an hour later, i get an alert on my phone that Blissey was returned. Irritated, but it happens.   

But what really annoyed me is that on the way back both gyms were blue, and BOTH gyms were taken over by the same dude!   

Obviously I put my petty hat on, finished my errand, and came back to the spot. There's a coffee and bagel spot near one of the gyms, so I posted up, took the gym back. Dude was still in the area because he insta tried to take it back. I gave myself a 10 golden berry max as my walk away line and defended as much as I could. Fortunately a Slacking joined me so it made life a bit easier. Eventually he gave up, so I finished my food and bounced.  

But I wasn't done. 

I went home for a few hours, and as my watch alarm buzzed (exactly one hour and 45 minutes), I headed out to ""run another quick errand.""  

I went back to the twin gyms. The yellow one had a few more in it (😃), and the blue one was full at that point, including the dude.  

I adjusted my petty hat, and started attacking... him.  
A couple of rounds with machamp and he was kicked.   

I'm home now, but I'm close enough that I can peek the gym. Both gyms are full. One yellow, one blue, but without the dude.  

Here's the takeaway: I already have my 50 coins, and let's be honest, he probably does too. But it made me realize, if he'd just taken one gym and left the other one, he'd be chilling in his gym, probably until tomorrow morning. Instead, who knows. Maybe he's in a Wawa on his knees, crying.  

That's how I imagine it anyway.

This is my first job after graduating. I love it, it’s  a great stepping stone. It has been hard to make friends here, maybe since I’m the youngest (early 20s) and POC, but I thought I made two nice coworker friends, (one in the 40s the other in late 20s). 

I had to set up a meeting to help organize their online drive since the older one is leaving their position. My boss had me do this, and for context, I am an assistant but I am “technically” on the same level as them. After this experience, I’m seeing that is not true socially. 

Anyway, they were very rude about it. Anything I said was met with opposition and they didn’t change their attitude until I reiterated our boss asked me to do this. I have been very flustered with all the changes this year, so I went to my boss who is very kind, and let it out. She basically told me it didn’t matter what they thought and that she would see about setting trainings up for them to deal with workplace change and stuff of that sort. She told me to not worry about the organization for now and we’d wait till she left her position to figure it out. 

Later that day, the two coworkers who pinged me into one of their offices and started the conversation by asking about my “office relationships”. I was a bit confused, so I just said I enjoy working here. I didn’t feel the need to bring up the meeting because I already discussed it with my boss, who said didn’t see that we needed to do that either. 

Basically, the email I had sent a week prior for the meeting is what upset them. They asked if I was open to feedback, which I always am, so I said of course. They told me my email was “abrasive.” The older one said in her ten years of world she hasn’t been spoke to in that way. The other said that it didn’t reflect the way she speaks which adds a dozen “please” to her messages. I was very thrown off because I couldn’t recall the email content, they couldn’t either and wouldn’t pull it up. after the meeting, I found it. It’s as follows:

“Hi, [redacted] and [redacted],

I am attaching a WIP copy of file management guidelines for you to look at ahead of meeting on Thursday. I'm borrowing quite a bit from what I implemented in my university org, so we can talk more about how these guidelines can be improved and tailored for our team.

To prep for our meeting, make sure you are familiar with all the folders and files in [redacted] and note what can be reorganized.

Have a great rest of your day!”

Usually, I am not like this at all, but I just burst into tears. My sister was just diagnosed with a condition and I hadn’t been getting good sleep, so I was rather emotional (I didn’t mention any of this). I apologized and told them I didn’t mean for it to come off any sort of way and would have preferred they came to me sooner rather than let it stew because I could obviously feel tension from their end with no idea why.  

They responded by saying if they had known our boss assigned it they would have approached it differently, and that I’m really lucky I have them to be willing to give me feedback. They also admitted they were avoiding me and didn’t speak to our boss about the email, and admittedly let the tension stew. They also did this the day before winter vacation. 

I’m not sure. I feel dumb but I’m so new to the role it felt so condescending. I guess I just need reassurance that email wasn’t that bad. Maybe a please would have been better, but at the point we’d go out and get coffee and hang out for happy hour so I didn’t think it was unprofessional or too casual. I’m not sure.

My own theory is fairly similar actually and implicates all three as well. That's really the only way the three of them maintaining silence works. Mine implicated Patsy a little more and John is just covering for prior SA.  

I had been writing this up for a post but I'm not a regular or longtime devotee to the case. I just linger out of curiosity. But I've now been down this rabbit hole for a good 6 months myself and probably need to get off here. So like that person I'll post my theory. I'm far from an expert on any of this but this is just my collated thoughts on how it could come to pass in the way it did and with what we know.

  
My Jon Benet Ramsey theory/timeline:

\-       The Ramseys return from the party and Jon Benet is asleep or mostly asleep. John takes her to her bed and leaves her there. Burke is milling around still playing with various Christmas toys. John thinks he is in his room at this time. John goes to sleep.

\-       Patsy is fretting over stuff for the trip, packing, organizing, whatever. At some point she goes and rouses Jon Benet knowing she is a bed wetter and takes her to pee. She puts her back in bed and perhaps got Burke a pineapple snack in this timeframe. She is again busy doing stuff and unaware of the kids actual movements.

\-       At some point Burke has gone back downstairs as he later admitted playing with a particular toy. Jon Benet having been roused awake may have been hungry or just not asleep now and goes to see where everyone is. She finds Burke eating pineapple Patsy got for him and she steals a piece playfully or daringly as a sibling might. Burke has had enough of JB today. It’s been a long day and he reacts in a childlike uncontrolled angry way. He chases after her into the basement and bashes her in the skull with the flashlight. She collapses. He leaves her there and evades the scene for now (may have poked her with the train track to check if she was ok).

\-       Sometime later Patsy is about to go to sleep. She is still dressed but makes one last check on JB and Burke finding him in his bedroom but JB is missing and Burke shrugs saying he’s not sure where she is. She searches the house and finds her (seemingly dead) and shrieks. This is the scream the neighbor heard through vents and open broken window, but two floors above John is asleep and does not hear it.

\-       She confronts Burke and he says she stole some pineapple and he hit her. But he is indifferent and acts like it was nothing. Downplaying it. Patsy now knows (believes) he killed her. Her reaction is protective parent but in a heat of the moment panicked way she makes a critical decision. Not wishing to alarm Burke she tells the first little lie that leads to the entire cover-up. She tells Burke that she found JB and she was “fine” and is in bed now.  She doesn’t call anyone as she believes JB is already dead.

\-       Patsy has some time here with John asleep and decides to make it appear like an intruder attempted to kidnap her. She rehearses one ransom note, disposes of it and writes the final draft purposefully trying to obfuscate things and make her handwriting slightly different in some cases. She believes she can convince Burke that he didn’t do anything to her that led to her death and instead fabricate a bigger lie.

\-       She decides that the intruder would have done something more to her than just hit her and she fashions the garrote and ties her hands, etc. She got this idea from the JB doll in the box earlier. She finishes the job knowing or believing she was dead already or close to it. And this way the cause of death isn’t the blow to the head (which at the time she does not know was so damaging). She then places the note and waits and lays down fully dressed. Ready to react if she has to. 

\-       In the early morning John wakes up first unaware of anything and gets in the shower. Patsy gets up and “gets ready” which doesn’t take long as she was already dressed. John does not know this and is (like a guy) unaware that she is in the same clothes really or just figured that is what she planned to wear. To be clear they have separate bathrooms anyway and as he got up first he did not see what she wearing in bed.

\-       Patsy goes downstairs to the kids level and fusses about for 10 minutes as she says with some packing and a jumper for JB. She is just waiting until John is out of the shower. Then she goes down “to make coffee” and “finds” the note and screams. John comes down. This is the first thing time he knows anything about it. 

\-       They check and sure enough she is gone from her bed and Burke is in his room asleep. She plays up the intruder thing and is exasperated. John decides they should call the police despite what the note says but Patsy objects initially because of what the note says. John decides to check the house and finds her in the basement.

\-       John tells Patsy he found her and they grieve over her, etc. But what is done is done. John now insists they call the police but decides that they should act unaware that they found her to sell the story better.  Why would he do that? Well John has his own part in this little ruse that Patsy knows nothing about.

\-       Sometime in this window of time between discovering her body, the note, and calling the police John revisits JB body and SA her with the paintbrush. This is to cover up previous SA he knows about (from either himself or Burke). He may even tell Patsy he did this to sell the intruder story. Patsy also reinforces with John that Burke was in his room all night.

 Now they are each complicit in this but nobody knows the whole story.

Burke knows he hit her but because of his parents actions he believes something worse happened to her later that night at the hands of an intruder. He has some plausible deniability he can convince himself of (at 9 years old and with the help of his parents). His later odd interviews and acting out her being hit in the head is projecting his own internal guilt although he believes she was killed by someone else. But in that way he connects the blow to the head in dramatic fashion for anyone (in his 9 year old mind).0

Patsy believes she is just protecting Burke who has some definite emotional/psychological issues (on the spectrum at least, maybe bipolar, certainly Aspergers) which allows him to be easily convinced that it was not his actions that led to her death. In her mind JB was dead anyway, why compound it and not knowing it would become a huge international case of interest she figured they just had to convince police of an intruder and they staged it that way.

 For his part John does not want his SA (or the SA at the hands of Burke) to be discovered or have them blamed for it. So the SA after the fact and the intruder theory are a good cover for that. He may know or realize Burke hit her and Patsy staged the initial scene but he isn’t gonna blow that cover. He will stick to the story. Likewise Patsy will stick to the story and despite the SA she will rationalize that it was after the fact and deny mentally that any SA occurred before from within the house. Burke will maintain his lack of involvement as his parents have convinced him it had nothing to do with his accidental act of hitting her in a moment of rage as he does not want that discovered. So he will stay quiet and maintain their cover story too and confirm that he was in his room all night (except he later slips up saying he did go down to play with a toy) and heard nothing.

 

As it is now the right time for them to awaken and find this scene before their flight, John insists she call the police (despite what the letter says which they would think would lend to their innocence – why would they call the police if they were involved). Police arrive and the Ramseys act distraught as they would be – but unconcerned about the timelines of the kidnappers demands. They call friends over probably as more cover and to potentially corrupt anything in the crime scene.  They expect the police to search and find her. When that fails to happen they find her themselves (John) and carry her body up then tampering with the scene and any physical evidence providing more cover.

 

At this point they are all locked into their cover story and will never budge off of it.

I believe this answers why each remains silent and does not throw each other under the bus. All three are guilty to some degree and covering for some part of it and their own hand in it. Also explains them dragging their feet on stuff and pointing to any, and all, possible outside theories or implicating crazies that try to admit to the crime. And none of them will ever admit to it or implicate the other Ramseys even after death (as we saw with Patsy) because of their own part in it.

Discussion welcome of course.

My problem is the two brands I’ve tried are DISGUSTING. I’ve tried mixing them with protein shakes, in smoothies, in my coffee, in my oatmeal. And all I can taste is the collagen. What brands do y’all like? And how do you use it? ",1,1735678543.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

(x-post from TRT)","This post especially for anyone with ADHD, Depression, Bipolar, anything psychiatric. Did TRT affect the way any of your meds worked, or did it allow you to get off of any? (especially antidepressants/anxiety)

I'm currently having my Adderall ""not work"" anymore. But I'd also like to hear of anyone else's experiences on any other medications. My HR goes up, and I feel stimmed, but I'm not feeling the ""high"" from it that normally pulls me to do everything I need to do.

My only theory for what I'm experiencing is that when my test went from 600ng to 300ng, everything started giving me loads of anxiety. Coffee, tea, preworkout, i couldn't have anything. (But that could also be from a histamine intolerance issue I'm trying to figure out)

But with the Adderall, it's possible that I was using the anxiety/fear of failure/getting in trouble/ ""Oh shit"" mode from my Adderall to get things done. Now that I'm much chiller and less anxious on Testosterone, maybe that's blunting the effects from it? idk. Just curious if anyone experienced any changes like this. It's hard to describe to someone that's never taken ADHD meds but I used to get a very machine-like ""pull"" or ""forward momentum"" towards doing my tasks that I'm not getting anymore. It used to be effortless. I'm not blaming the test, I could also just be burnt out, there's a lot of factors in my life, but I just figured to ask.

And if Test allowed you to get OFF certain medications, that would be awesome to hear of. Thanks in advance",3,1735678251.0,Testosterone,8,1.0,False

1hqnooj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hqnooj/can_resuming_coffee_after_quitting_create_gut/,Can resuming coffee after quitting create gut dysbiosis and leaky gut?,"So I quit coffee earlier this year after drinking it for several years, was caffeine free for about 3 months, and then started back up drinking coffee again.  I never had any noticable digestion problems before starting to drink coffee, during the years l was drinking coffee heavily, or after I quit fairly recently.

About 3 months ago I started to have unexplainable itchy skin and what seems to be histamine intolerance reactions when I eat foods.  I was wondering what the cause could be and couldn't figure it out.  I tried elimination diets and found moderate success with low histamine diets but they didn't seem to fix the issue and it would present itself again when introducing foods I have always eaten during my life.

I even stopped drinking coffee again for a few weeks during this time but still had reactions of unexplainable itchy skin.

I have gone gluten free, tried new laundry detergent, even started washing my clothes outside and hanging them to dry.  I've even started sleeping in a new building.

I couldn't think of anything that I had changed around that time until earlier today I realized that I had started back drinking coffee a week or two before those symptoms showed up.  Now I'm wondering if quitting coffee then resuming again could trigger some type of gut dysbiosis or leaky gut that wasn't present when I was drinking coffee before.

Is that a possibility?

I discounted the idea that coffee could be a contributing factor because I stopped drinking coffee about a month or so into the symptoms I was experiencing but didn't necessarily correlate it with feeling better.  Now I'm thinking it could have just not been enough time to reverse a possible newly introduced gut dysbiosis from reintroducing coffee into my system after having quit for months prior.

It was also difficult for me to think coffee could be contributing to the cause because I had drank coffee for years prior without any of those symptoms, they're all new within the past 3 months.

Could stopping coffee then reintroducing cause issues that weren't present when drinking coffee regularly?

I'm starting to think it has.  It's the only thing I can think of that's pretty significant in terms of a change in my life around the time I started noticing symptoms.  

I know this is the /decaf sub and asking about coffee being bad for you is like going into a barbershop and asking if I need a haircut, buy genuinely has anyone any personal experience with something like this knows about something like this happening all of a sudden when going back to coffee after having quit for months prior?",2,1735678119.0,decaf,3,0.75,False
1hqnoi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/trt/comments/1hqnoi7/adhd_especially_has_trt_changed_anyones_responses/,"ADHD especially, Has TRT changed anyones responses to any medications?","This post especially for anyone with ADHD, Depression, Bipolar, anything psychiatric. Did TRT affect the way any of your meds worked, or did it allow you to get off of any? (especially antidepressants/anxiety)   
    
I'm currently having my Adderall ""not work"" anymore. But I'd also like to hear of anyone else's experiences on any other medications. My HR goes up, and I feel stimmed, but I'm not feeling the ""high"" from it that normally pulls me to do everything I need to do.  
  
My only theory for what I'm experiencing is that when my test went from 600ng to 300ng, everything started giving me loads of anxiety. Coffee, tea, preworkout, i couldn't have anything. (But that could also be from a histamine intolerance issue I'm trying to figure out) 
  
But with the Adderall, it's possible that I was using the anxiety/fear of failure/getting in trouble/ ""Oh shit"" mode from my Adderall to get things done. Now that I'm much chiller and less anxious on Testosterone, maybe that's blunting the effects from it? idk. Just curious if anyone experienced any changes like this.   
  
It's hard to describe to someone that's never taken ADHD meds but I used to get a very machine-like ""pull"" or ""forward momentum"" towards doing my tasks that I'm not getting anymore. It used to be effortless. I'm not blaming the test, I could also just be burnt out, there's a lot of factors in my life, but I just figured to ask.
    
And if Test allowed you to get OFF certain medications, that would be awesome to hear of. Thanks in advance",1,1735678104.0,trt,1,1.0,False

I wasn't going to make another post, but I don't know what else to do. I have no one else I can tell these things without being called crazy, or god forbid, the people close to me think I am just making things up. My life continues to go downhill. I have been having nightmares for a few days now in which I see the creature that was protecting the barn. In these interludes, the twisted face hovered just inches above mine while I lay paralyzed, my heart beating hard in my throat. I wake up sweating and hyperventilating, my fingers trembling.

I usually can't go back to sleep afterward, and have stopped trying, instead brewing a pot of coffee and getting my day started. To be fair, the extra time has been nice and given me the opportunity to get my pantry and refrigerator restocked. In the last few days, however, the lack of sleep was catching up to me. It was starting to effect my performance at work .I made my first major mistake last week. I had apparently forgotten to put out the wet floor sign, and one of my co-workers slipped. Fortunately, they weren't seriously hurt.

I still got chewed out, though. I also would have been liable if the injury would have been more serious. That didn't seem to sink in however because I screwed up again yesterday, and this time a rack of product was destroyed. Again, no one was hurt. I was sitting at the table after one of the nightly episodes, listening to the sound of the machine on the countertop, the aroma of the caffeinated water reaching my nose, lifting some of the fog from my brain. The first cup helped to open my eyes a little further.

I had a few errands to run before I clocked in. I did what needed to be done, and went out for a late breakfast, tucking myself into the back corner of the diner as far from other people as I could. I didn't even really want to interact with the hostess or server though I had to. I barely tasted my food as I chewed and swallowed it. Things were starting to seem very strange to me, almost surreal, no matter how mundane the scene in front of me was. I blame it on sleep deprivation, because even as I type this I am unsure if I am dreaming. Maybe I am just a little drunk.

On top of my personal life crumbling around me, I have been getting the feeling that I am being watched. It started a few days ago, while I was outside, cleaning out the gutters during a brief respite from the rain. I glanced around from my vantage point on the ladder, but saw nothing suspicious, just people going about their daily lives. I walked back inside, but the feeling didn't subside. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe in my own home until I left for work. I barely remember making it through my shift, my brain fuzzy and buzzing from lack of sleep and paranoia.

As soon as I got home, I crawled into the bottle, barely paying attention to the movie I had turned on. I glanced around, lamenting the lack of decorations that I had put up even though at this point it was only a few days before Christmas. The feeling didn't motivate me to do anything more than drink more. I passed out on the couch, and wasn't quite awake when my brain registered the sound of something scraping over the side of my apartment. I sat up quickly, my head spinning quickly from the alcohol still circulating my bloodstream.

I glanced toward the front door, holding my breath and half expecting the knob to begin to turn. It didn't and after a while, my heartbeat slowed and my brain began to rationalize things. I started to feel silly, and as I stood, I glanced toward the window. I saw a flicker of movement there, and was positive I hadn't imagined it, and against every instinct, I moved in that direction. When I looked through the curtains, I saw nothing unusual. I again mentally chastised myself. I was allowing my mind to play tricks on me, and I was embarrassed even though I was alone.

I stumbled my way to the bed and collapsed into it, letting my eyes close again. This time it was dreams of the twisted, shadowy figure with the glowing eyes that woke me. This time I was far more clear headed and the sun was beginning to come up. I shaved and showered, then got dressed. I went out to send off some bill payments, and stopped at a small coffee shop on a whim. I ordered my drink and turned to walk to a table, bumping into another patron.

“I'm sorry. Excuse me.” I proclaimed meekly.

“It's okay.” the stranger said, and when I looked up and met his eyes, I was immediately flushed.

This man was beautiful. He had clear skin and large brown eyes situated above a set of cupid-bow lips. I stammered and moved out of his way, waiting for the barista to call my name. He stranger I had bumped into approached me after a few minutes. I felt myself flush again. He didn't say anything, and even smiled when the young girl behind the counter called my name. I noticed because I couldn't stop peeking at him from the corner of my eye. I went to work without returning home and found myself thinking about the encounter throughout the day.

As if I had manifested him, the man with the brown eyes came to my place of work.

“Hello again.” he said with a slight smile when our eyes met.

“How are you?” I replied, still slightly distracted with what I was doing.

“Doing fine, and yourself?” the stranger prodded, lingering near me.

“Living the dream.” I joked, though I began to wonder if the man had followed me here, after seeing my name tag at the coffee shop.

The paranoia I had been feeling for the past few days re-emerged suddenly and I felt a panic attack coming on. I didn't even excuse myself, just walked away quickly, feet carrying me into the break room. I closed the door behind me and sat on the couch, trying not to give in to the lightheaded feeling that was coming over me. I lost that battle, lost in blackness, and being stalked by those glowing eyes and when I came to, there were a few concerned faces hovering over me, one of them belonging to my boss.

“Are you okay?” Scott asked, the concern still evident in his face.

“I think so, yeah.” I tried to assure him, but to be honest, I still felt a little bit off.

“We called the ambulance. I need you to stay put until they get here.” he told me.

“Whatever you say.” I agreed. I didn't feel like standing anyway.

The man and woman in the uniform arrived and gave me a quick but thorough once over, giving me the all clear to go back to work, though I was told to go the hospital at the first sign of a headache as I had apparently hit my head on the floor. I flt the knot on the back of my scalp, and it was still tender, but at least it didn't seem to have split. My hair wasn't matted and I didn't feel a wound in my gentle prodding. I eventually made my way back out to the floor, and to my relief, the stranger was gone. I went about the rest of the day without incident.

Before I left, Scott caught up with me.

“I need to see you in my office for a minute.” he said.

I nodded and followed him. When we got inside, he motioned for the chair almost directly in front of me. I sat down and he let out a long breath that wasn't quite a sigh.

“I think you need to take some time off. Unfortunately we can't pay you, but we have already started an unemployment claim for you.” he told me in his gentlest voice.

I didn't argue, I just stood up and left. I went home and immediately poured myself a drink. I didn't eat anything that night. Christmas came and went, but I was just going through the motions. My mother and father tried to make me laugh, but it didn't work. I felt myself slipping further into despair. I had lost everything, and even my sleep was being taken from me by the terrible dreams I was having nightly. I started drinking as soon as I got home once again. After a few drinks, I began to feel hot, the air in my apartment drier than it should have been.

I walked through the front door and outside, letting the cool night air sink through my somewhat damp clothing, the moisture on my skin almost immediately turning ice cold. My breath hung in front of my lips in a faint vapor cloud, but it all felt so good. The frigid air seemed to soothe the heat inside me, and I was glad for that. I was turning to walk back inside when I saw a figure standing beneath a streetlight. To my relief, they were normally proportioned, but seemed to be waring dark clothing.

'Probably just one of the neighbors.' I thought as I walked back into my home.

I tried to cling to that thought, but before long, I found myself walking around, checking the window locks and closing the blinds. The paranoid feeling that had overwhelmed me earlier started to return. Before I could spiral completely out of control I used my phone to look for things to help anxiety. One of the first results was to take a walk. I decided that I would do just that, putting on a heavy jacket and gloves before I left this time. I pulled the hood up over my head and glanced both ways down the street.

This time I was the only person outside. I started walking toward a gas station a few blocks away. When I got there, I went inside, and started moving toward the cooler to claim a bottle of iced tea, and froze when I saw the stranger from the coffee shop standing in one of the aisles. I should have left, but I couldn't get my feet to move. He looked my way.

“Fancy meeting you here.” the stranger said, his lips curling up in a smile.

“Yeah, hi.” I replied without thinking, though the words were awkward and clipped.

“I feel like I should introduce myself at this point.” the handsome man joked, trying to break the tension that had formed in the room.

“If you insist.” I said in return, the creepy feeling once again fading as he moved around the small table with discounted candy sitting on top of it. We shook hands and once again when our eyes met, I felt my face flush.

“My name's Jeff.” he said, his smile growing a bit when he noticed that I was blushing.

I told him my name as well, and we both paid for our items and we left the store together. Even though it was late, I was happy for the company.

“Do you want to walk me home?” I asked, without intending to. The words fell out of my mouth before the thought was complete in my brain.

“How far is it?” he enquired with a quick glance at the watch on his wrist.

“A few blocks.” I told him, and he nodded.

When we got to the apartment complex, he accompanied me to my door.

“Come in.” I invited, hoping that having someone around would quell my nightmares.

When we got into the place, I went straight to the linen closet and got him a blanket and pillow, placing those on the couch. He smiled and I felt a flutter of butterflies in my stomach. He patted the sofa next to himself, and I felt my cheeks grow hot again as I moved to sit next to him.

“I know it's late, or well, early in the morning, but do you think we could have one drink?” Jeff requested.

I shrugged, and retorted, “I guess there's no harm in it. You like whiskey?”

“It'll do.” he nodded.

I started to stand to go get the bottle but he insisted on doing it for me. A little bit of my earlier paranoia returned and so I followed him, pointing to the cupboard where the bottle was and then the shot glasses. He poured a measure of the brown liquor into one of the small glasses for each of us. I made sure to watch his hands carefully, but as far as I could tell, he hadn't slipped me anything. There was no strange cloudiness or bubbles in the whiskey, so I drank it. Then we had another. Then another. Before I really comprehended what was happening we were in bed together. After we finished and got cleaned up, I laid next to Jeff, and as I drifted to sleep, I thought I saw his eyes glowing.

I woke up long after noon had passed. I was alone. I sat up slowly, and looked around, my brain dragging a little bit. There was no sign that Jeff had been there at all. The blanket and pillow I had placed on the couch was back in the linen closet, and there was one shot glass sitting in the dish drainer. I shook my head and moved to the bathroom, taking a long shower. I toweled off and got dressed, then drove to the grocery store. I began to feel as if I was being watched again. I developed tunnel vision and my head spun.

I tried to hurry toward the bathroom, but didn't make it, as far as I know. I woke up in the back of an ambulance, and as the doors closed, I swore I saw Jeff's face in the crowd of concerned faces of the employees and other customers. His lips were turned up in a familiar smile and his usually brown eyes seemed to smolder with amber light. When I got to the hospital, I was diagnosed with a severe concussion and released after a few hours. I tried to call Terry to tell him about my fainting spells, but he didn't answer.

I woke a couple of days ago to knocking at my door. A man in a delivery uniform stood there, and handed me a small flower arrangement. The small card said get well soon but there was no sender. That's when I saw Jeff walking around the corner away from my house. I didn't chase him, but I am going to confront him the next time we meet.",5,1735677752.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1hqnjwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1hqnjwe/retiring_at_55_game_plan/,Retiring at 55 game plan ,"I had alittle bit of help from chat GpT here but I think I finally know my fire number and what my goals are. AI thinks it’s do able, I’m curious what real people think. 

My goal is to retire at 55 with about 2m, probably sell my home or rent it out (worth 500k now), own a coffee shop or some kind of business overseas, sail around Europe half the year or so in the early part and visit family/friends in the states. 

Im hoping the retirement gets me to 67 and then I’d probably sell the boat and have social security if it’s still around. This also doesn’t include what my wife would get from social security either. 

ChatGPT response- retiring at 55 with $2 million in retirement savings, a paid-off house worth $500,000–$750,000, and eventually drawing Social Security should provide a solid foundation

- If you withdraw 4% annually (a common rule of thumb for sustainable withdrawals):  
  - $2 million × 4% = **$80,000/year**.  

Social Security - Assume you start at 67 for maximum benefit):  
- Average Social Security benefit: ~$2,000–$3,500/month (depending on your earnings history).  
  - $24,000–$42,000/year starting at 67.  

Combined, these could provide **$80,000–$122,000/year

 Projected Expenses
Living abroad 
- Housing (minimal costs since your home is paid off): ~$2,000–$5,000/year (utilities, maintenance, property tax).  
- Groceries and dining: ~$6,000–$10,000/year.  
- Healthcare: $1,200–$3,000/year (private insurance or out-of-pocket).  
- Miscellaneous: ~$3,000–$6,000/year.  

Total Expenses: ~$12,000–$24,000/year.  

Sailboat Expenses
- Maintenance, mooring, and insurance: $10,000–$20,000/year.  
- Fuel and other costs: $2,000–$4,000/year.  

Total Boat Costs:$12,000–$24,000/year.  

North America Visits (~4–6 months/year)
- Flights: $2,000–$5,000/year for two round trips.  
- Temporary housing: $0–$10,000/year (if staying with family, much lower).  
- Additional costs: ~$5,000–$10,000/year.  

Total North America Expenses: $7,000–$25,000/year.  

Miscellaneous and Hobbies:
- Entertainment, travel, and savings cushion: ~$5,000–$10,000/year.  

Grand Total Annual Expenses:
- Moderate Lifestyle: $36,000–$60,000/year.  
- More Luxurious Lifestyle:$55,000–$90,000/year.  


3. Long-Term Sustainability
- Before Social Security (Ages 55–67):
  You’d rely entirely on your savings.  
  - $80,000/year × 12 years = $960,000 withdrawn by age 67.  
  - Remaining savings: ~$1.04 million (assuming 5% investment growth minus withdrawals).  

-After Social Security (67+):
  Your annual withdrawal rate would drop significantly.  
  - With Social Security providing ~$24,000–$42,000/year, you might only need $30,000–$50,000/year from savings.  
  - This reduced withdrawal rate, coupled with investment growth, makes your $2M last 30+ years. 

Verdict
Yes, you can sustain this lifestyle comfortably. Your $2M savings, paid-off house, and Social Security provide more than enough flexibility, even for unexpected expenses or market fluctuations.

1hqneib,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancunAllInclusives/comments/1hqneib/melia_casa_maya_cancun_the_fyre_festival_of_hotels/,"Melia Casa Maya, Cancun - The Fyre Festival of Hotels?","This hotel is newly renovated and re-opened under the Melia brand on Dec 16th, 2024. My stay began Dec 21st, 2024. We booked a suite as there were 4 of us, and we'd be there for 7 days, so needed extra room, including a living space to lounge and play games in the evenings.

I totally understand and expected that there would be teething pains staying at a newly opened hotel, however, the website and call center are very misleading to offer **The Level** services for an extra cost when there are **NO The Level services available.** I'm very perplexed as to how this hotel is taking guests money and not offering the services that are promised. This is fraudulent behavior.

This review is based on The Level. DO NOT book The Level at this time. Almost everything that is described on the website, and through their booking reps on the phone is inaccurate.

An appropriate suite was not available for us upon check-in, so we had to stay in a regular room, then move to a suite. Also, they gave us the wrong wristbands (non-level) and we didn't realize for a full day until I asked for a specific liquor and was given a cost. So no premium liquor for us the first day. And it was a struggle getting premium liquor even with the correct wrist bands.

What was promised and what we paid for with **The Level Ocean View Suite**:

* **Ocean view suite with superior location/views**
   * No premium view in the room we stayed (view of construction/building rooftops), unfinished - no balcony furniture, no couch! Nothing like the photos on the website. When we asked if we could get a sofa since we would be staying for so long, we were provided with a rollaway bed for a make-shift couch.
   * Very much thrown together last minute. I'm wondering if we were put in a room that wasn't renovated yet. Even the tiling looked incomplete. I will provide photos of the space.
* **Private The Level lounge with drinks and hor d'oeuvres** 
   * Not open and nowhere near done. It seems they are using this as a storage room currently.
* **Private The Level section on the beach** 
   * No such thing.
* **The Level tote bag and adult 'Mindfulness' coloring book** 
   * Finally received tote bag mid-way through stay after inquiring / coloring book is non-existent.
* **Premium shower amenities** 
   * These are 'Rituals' branded as described, but we had hand wash in place of shower gel in the first room / soaps with no pumps and and not anchored to pump mechanism in our 2nd room.
* **Complimentary room service**
   * Phone lines are down and the app does not work yet to request anything. Front desk was unsure how they were going about room service after our concierge leaves for the day.
   * We were not allowed to bring plates to our room (tried to bring a little plate of dessert from the buffet up one evening, and another time a cup of tea, were stopped and told we cannot. Very restricting!)
   * The 'fully-stocked' mini bar was far from fully stocked. It seemed like they were rationing as we only got 2 waters a day for 4 people (yes, you can get water in a cup from the bar, but it did not taste good to me, and I would prefer a bottle). Also 2 cokes, 2 sprites, 2 beers a day. The minimal water made it impossible to use the coffee machine and tea kettle in the room.
   * Regardless, the coffee & teas was never restocked from the first time we used it.
* **Priority/Premium check-in**
   * Not the case. I did see a priority sign on one of the desks, but it seems they are not using it. When I tried to go straight to the desk, I was told I had to wait in the longer line that is feeding into the front desks.
* **Premium liquor and wine**
   *  As mentioned above, we were given the wrong wrist bands and so lost out on this the first day.
   * On multiple occasions we saw bartenders make our drinks with house liquor. Upon asking them if they used the premium liquor they confirmed yes, even though that was not the truth. Moving forward, we had to specify with each order that we would like premium liquor to at least make use of the ONE & ONLY perk offered as part of The Level.
* **Private concierge**
   * He was very nice however we were told by another staff member that he was the only concierge and to be patient with him. We could tell he was working very hard and so did not bother him other than booking dinner reservations for the restaurants.

Overall, I believed they rushed opening in order to get holiday bookings, and it very much showed. They should not be letting people book for The Level! This is absurd! And once again, fraud.

Generally the hotel is beautiful, the decor in the common areas, the bar, the restaurants, the pool area was very nice. There are some eye-sores on the beach with caution tape that I am not sure what they plan to do with. A lot is incomplete and workmanship a little shoddy (like paint on tiles and railings, some construction debris). Sink was blocked in the first room, and that first afternoon there was no water coming out of the faucets! Water was fine in the 2nd room however I overheard complaints of no hot water, and un-flushable toilets (we definitely had to flush a couple times for everything to go down).

The water park did not open until a couple of days after we arrived.

The food is okay - I am a foodie so was not really expecting amazing meals. I won't make any complaints about the food. It was as expected. The restaurant openings do not align with the schedule shared on the app/website so it was hard to plan meals.

**There are 4 Restaurants:**

**1. Merkado** (buffet) was open for breakfast every morning. Not open for lunch. It was closed a couple evenings. The first night, the front desk told us that is where we could eat that evening as the other restaurants needed reservations. It wasn't even open!

**2. The Grill** (buffet - meats, burgers, hotdogs) seemed to be open every afternoon for lunch, some evenings.

**3. Casa Nostra** (menu based - Italian) open every night. Reservation only, but accept walk-ins if available. Reserve for an early time as they run out of menu items.

**4. Cape Noa** (menu based - Seafood (ish)) closed most evenings we were there, open every morning and afternoon. Serious about their reservations, we could not do a walk-in. We did not get to try their dinner menu as it was closed the majority of our stay. They are open for breakfast for The Level guests. They had some elevated options like berries instead of melons, one day they had little avocado/fruit toast. But mostly have the same things as the Mekardo buffet, if not less.

Yes, we did speak to management about a price-adjustment for The Level concerns but were told to contact the call center (which they could not provide a number or email for).

Not only did he not pay me  what he promised but also he came in like 5 seconds so the sex wasn’t even enjoyable and to add insult to the injury he had also TAKEN money from me when I am most in need. 
THAT WAS THE LAST BIT OF MONEY i had.

I ended up in tears, on nye couldn’t hang out w my friends because I have no money, my friend wasn’t at her house that the guy had dropped me off at so I had to walk to a nearby cafe, when I reached in for my cash to pay for coffee that’s when I had realized that it has gone missing alongside a bracelet I had in there.

So I literally just slept on the couch in that little corner neighborhood coffeeshop no joke until one of my friends from around the area saw me, gave me a good talking to and offered to get me an uber home which she did (im so thankful for that honestly).

I got home at noon-ish and I just slept through the whole day.

I woke up in the pm, around 8 to another friend (my ex best friend at this point) writing a whole paragraph telling me how we don’t have that much in common anymore and I make way too many rash decisions and how they think we shouldn’t be friends.


I texted a fourth friend (?) (for number keeping sake) telling them that I might have to check myself into the mental hospital today but idk if that is a good idea so I have reached out to my dad instead.


Dad said im too old for him to give me an allowence in general (im 22, female, still a college student) but aside from that, from what he saw he thinks that my friend is mistaken for leaving me cuz im “smart and nice and (his words not mine) amazing” etc

I love my father so much but he left out the part where i am bipolar and bpd and it’s hard for people to befriend me when im not at my best.

At the end of the day I guess I am writing this to let it all out.
Pls don’t say anything mean you could be my 13th reason.
Just pls practice humanity empathy and kindness.

1hqn8qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hqn8qc/should_i_give_her_another_chance_after_she/,Should I give her another chance after she rejected me eight years ago?,"
This is a lengthy post as I need to include some details as to why I’m hesitating with this amazing girl that I recently reconciled with. It’s also worth mentioning I was cheated on before by a girlfriend and have had trouble trusting women since.

I (30m) recently reconciled with a woman (26f) after eight years. We met when I was 22 and she was 18, and I fell for her pretty fast. She was funny, smart and incredibly beautiful.

However, I think due to her young age, she pulled some immature stunts off. For example, she would never agree to meet me by herself, and would always bring two of her friends with her, asking to hang in my apartment and for us to provide them with alcohol. I always had some of my friends over, as well, to balance it out.

Because she was so beautiful, most of my friends were interested in her, too, and she got along with them pretty well. Too well, almost, as some evenings she’d spend talking and laughing with my friends and almost not talk to me at all. Once, her and my best friend disappeared together and I later found them in the garden, sitting on a bench talking. As far as I know, they were not doing anything else, but I still found it disrespectful.

Another thing she’d do is ignore my messages for days, and every time I asked if we could hang out just the two of us, she’d dodge the question. She could also be very dismissive of me. Normally, I would take it as a sign that she’s not interested and only using me for free drinks for her and her friends, lol, but she was very sweet when it was just us two. On evenings they stayed over the whole night (her and her friends), we’d talk for hours and she’d let me kiss her sometimes (albeit, with open eyes, and never more than kissing), but we could really talk about deep stuff, and she easily made me laugh and as I said, she’s so pretty. Exactly my type.

We had a huge fallout after I heard a rumor that she’d done something sexual with one of my acquaintances. When I confronted her about it, she neither denied or confirmed, but got pissed, instead. We stopped talking for a while, and eventually the rumors turned out to not be true. I asked to see her, and she agreed (she brought her friend with her, lol). That evening went pretty well, I thought, and we ended up kissing, it was pretty passionate. However, in the night/morning when I went to the bathroom, I heard the front door slam shut and realized she’d snuck out with her friend without even saying goodbye.

I decided then that I’d had enough of her, but unfortunately I wanted to give her one more chance and reached out (she never reached out to me, btw), we hung out that evening and even started texting. However, a few days later I got a text from a guy saying he’s in a relationship with this girl and I texted her asking about it. She denied it, but I honestly didn’t believe her at that point and we left it at that.

I went about my life, got a girlfriend and a steady job as a manager at an office. Then one day, eight years later, she pops up as a new worker. I’ve got to say, I was shocked to see her. She looked exactly the same, just as beautiful, and was just as outgoing. It wasn’t long until everyone knew her and talked about her because of how beautiful she is.

I tried to ignore her at first, but she’d always appear from somewhere and start talking to me. I always go on my lunch break at the same time, and about three months after starting her job at the office, she started going to lunch at the same time as me. I don’t think she does this with anyone else, surely she’s friendly, but it feels like she goes out of her way to talk to me.

Me and my girlfriend of four years broke up, and after that my head’s been pretty messed up. I was reluctant at first to talk to this girl, but she is very persisrant, and eventually I started looking forward to our lunches more and more.

She seems interested in me. She’s chatty, smiles and laughs, she’s even made flirty comments to me here and there. Once, she even asked if I’d want to grab coffee some day after work, and I agreed. We exchanged numbers, but then she never reached out and I never did, either, but we continued to see each other at work and during lunch as if nothing.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to go back to how it was before, when I kept chasing after her and she just kept shutting me down. I don’t know if I can trust her or not. But it’s been eight years, isn’t there a huge chance that she has changed since then? She seems interested in me, I just don’t know if I should let her in again. What should I do? Could I give her another chance? Is there any possibility that this could work out? I know it’s the ”man’s job” to ask the woman out, but does this apply here, as well?

Any tips are welcome, I’d really appreciate it.

Edit: yes I’m an office manager but in a different department. We work in the same building, not the same department.

**TL;DR;** •we met eight years ago when she was 18
• she sent me mixed signals but we got along well
• due to stunts she pulled and rumors I decided to leave her
• eight years later we work at the same place
• she seems interested in me, do I give her a second chance or is this not worth it?",0,1735676776.0,relationships,19,0.5,False

She lives in a different state but visits my city every month and is moving here in May. About a week ago she came down to visit and I picked her up and we went for coffee. Everything went great and she seemed really into me and asked to set a date up again two days later. Everything was good yet again and we went out Wednesday and this past Friday after that. 

On Friday we went to dinner and then ended up back at her place where we made out and cuddled until the morning. I asked her if she wanted to keep going out when she came back to Dallas to which she enthusiastically replied yes and also said we could FaceTime when she went back home. Well come Saturday morning and she starts being shorter with texts and then doesn’t text me at all Sunday even though we had plans on Monday morning for brunch. I asked her if things were cool and this is the message she responded with:

 “yes I agree that are dates went well and I had a good time with you. I am also very grateful for the things you have done for me. I want to be fully transparent with you as well, I don’t think I am ready for a type of commitment that I think you are looking for, especially me living in a different state”. I responded that I was just looking to keep hanging out and talking and that I had only asked because she hadn’t been texting me, then she replied again with “I don’t think it would be appropriate to keep seeing each other because I’m not ready to date anyone anyone for now and I don’t want to waste your time. I haven’t been texting as much today because I wanted to think about how to say it. I’m sorry if this upsets you”. 

I think I was maybe coming on a little too strong. For instance I made and brought her pasta which she said was really sweet and I also told her Saturday that I was excited for our date Monday. I’m still very confused though. She did mention that she wanted to take things slow and that she was concerned because I had recently came out of a relationship of 6 years but she seemed fine at first about us living in different states. I don’t know, I thought things were going pretty well and was wondering if there was anything I could say to repair this or if I should just leave it alone?",1,1735676568.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

There's only one rule: Don't wake the protagonist.,"I started as an outline, a blurry nothing where I could barely see my reflection. 

The thought hit me one day when I was serving the main protagonist, a gloomy eyed teenage girl, side-by-side with her insomniac love interest.  I was Coffee Girl #3, and I was nothing but an extra. 

Pouring the protagonist’s coffee, I spilled some on my hand. 

*Pain*. 

It felt good. 

Real. 

“Fucking idiot.”

The love interest was smirking at me, his  attitude scripted.

The protagonist didn't pay attention. 

I had heard whisperings among other awake extras that if the main character ever awakened, they would go insane, unable to grasp the concept of their existence. 

I decided that the only way to save my fate and become a main character, was to get rid of her. 

So, I slashed her throat open in the storage room. 

When I was cleaning her blood from my hands, the world glitched, and suddenly, I was drinking coffee in front of the love interest, front and center. 

I did it.

I was the main character. 

“Anna?”

The love interest was talking to me, lips curled into a smile.

I had dreamed of this moment. 

I reached out and grabbed his hand, squeezing his fingers. But I wasn't expecting his body to jerk suddenly, an electric charge running through me. 

I pulled back, a shiver creeping down my spine. But the love interest had stiffened up, suddenly, his eyes widening. 

Behind me, Extra #5, who I worked with, burst into fleshy red chunks. 

My coffee cup in front of me began to unravel slowly, collapsing into jigsaw pieces. 

“What…?”

The love interest’s eyes found mine. 

He blinked. 

“What's happening…?”

Before I  could speak, he prodded his own face. 

“Not… real.” The boy whispered, his voice breaking into a sob. 

Furniture around me started to peel from existence, tables and chairs flying into the air. He clawed at his hair, then his face, clawing his eyes out, eyes that came apart like egg shells, empty and nothing. His lips formed a wide, maniacal grin. “Not real, not real, not real…” 

The boy jumped to his feet, laughing, and the ground beneath us splintered into nothing. I found myself inside nothing, drowning in *nothing*. 

“Not *real*.”

Fuck. 

I could already see it, my body, my reality, that I worked so hard for. 

Was coming…

A
P
A
R 
T. 

No. 

I cradled his face, but I don't think I had arms anymore. 

I forced him to look at me, his wide, terrified abysses of nothing staring back. 

“You're real,” I managed to gasp out, my own words starting to fade. 

He tried to nod, tears trickling down his cheeks. 

“I'm… r-real.” he whispered in a sob, shaking his head. 

When his face started to come apart, his colors being sucked into the deep abyss swallowing us up, I held him tighter. 

“Do you hear me?!” I screamed at him, my voice echoing, bouncing back in empty, wide nothing surrounding us.

What causes this level of a lack of awareness? Do people really not notice? Do they not give a shit?

To give some perspective, other people do actually close the door all the way, so other people definitely notice. Some of us take turns (without saying it) closing the door so the whole place doesn't freeze.

","This hotel is newly renovated and re-opened under the Melia brand on Dec 16th, 2024. My stay began Dec 21st, 2024. We booked a suite as there were 4 of us, and we'd be there for 7 days, so needed extra room, including a living space to lounge and play games in the evenings.

I totally understand and expected that there would be teething pains staying at a newly opened hotel, however, the website and call center are very misleading to offer **The Level** services for an extra cost when there are **NO The Level services available.** I'm very perplexed as to how this hotel is taking guests money and not offering the services that are promised. This is fraudulent behavior.

This review is based on The Level. DO NOT book The Level at this time. Almost everything that is described on the website, and through their booking reps on the phone is inaccurate.

An appropriate suite was not available for us upon check-in, so we had to stay in a regular room, then move to a suite. Also, they gave us the wrong wristbands (non-level) and we didn't realize for a full day until I asked for a specific liquor and was given a cost. So no premium liquor for us the first day. And it was a struggle getting premium liquor even with the correct wrist bands.

What was promised and what we paid for with **The Level Ocean View Suite**:

* **Ocean view suite with superior location/views**
   * No premium view in the room we stayed (view of construction/building rooftops), unfinished - no balcony furniture, no couch! Nothing like the photos on the website. When we asked if we could get a sofa since we would be staying for so long, we were provided with a rollaway bed for a make-shift couch.
   * Very much thrown together last minute. I'm wondering if we were put in a room that wasn't renovated yet. Even the tiling looked incomplete. I will provide photos of the space.
* **Private The Level lounge with drinks and hor d'oeuvres** 
   * Not open and nowhere near done. It seems they are using this as a storage room currently.
* **Private The Level section on the beach** 
   * No such thing.
* **The Level tote bag and adult 'Mindfulness' coloring book** 
   * Finally received tote bag mid-way through stay after inquiring / coloring book is non-existent.
* **Premium shower amenities** 
   * These are 'Rituals' branded as described, but we had hand wash in place of shower gel in the first room / soaps with no pumps and and not anchored to pump mechanism in our 2nd room.
* **Complimentary room service**
   * Phone lines are down and the app does not work yet to request anything. Front desk was unsure how they were going about room service after our concierge leaves for the day.
   * We were not allowed to bring plates to our room (tried to bring a little plate of dessert from the buffet up one evening, and another time a cup of tea, were stopped and told we cannot. Very restricting!)
   * The 'fully-stocked' mini bar was far from fully stocked. It seemed like they were rationing as we only got 2 waters a day for 4 people (yes, you can get water in a cup from the bar, but it did not taste good to me, and I would prefer a bottle). Also 2 cokes, 2 sprites, 2 beers a day. The minimal water made it impossible to use the coffee machine and tea kettle in the room.
   * Regardless, the coffee & teas was never restocked from the first time we used it.
* **Priority/Premium check-in**
   * Not the case. I did see a priority sign on one of the desks, but it seems they are not using it. When I tried to go straight to the desk, I was told I had to wait in the longer line that is feeding into the front desks.
* **Premium liquor and wine**
   *  As mentioned above, we were given the wrong wrist bands and so lost out on this the first day.
   * On multiple occasions we saw bartenders make our drinks with house liquor. Upon asking them if they used the premium liquor they confirmed yes, even though that was not the truth. Moving forward, we had to specify with each order that we would like premium liquor to at least make use of the ONE & ONLY perk offered as part of The Level.
* **Private concierge**
   * He was very nice however we were told by another staff member that he was the only concierge and to be patient with him. We could tell he was working very hard and so did not bother him other than booking dinner reservations for the restaurants.

Overall, I believed they rushed opening in order to get holiday bookings, and it very much showed. They should not be letting people book for The Level! This is absurd! And once again, fraud.

Generally the hotel is beautiful, the decor in the common areas, the bar, the restaurants, the pool area was very nice. There are some eye-sores on the beach with caution tape that I am not sure what they plan to do with. A lot is incomplete and workmanship a little shoddy (like paint on tiles and railings, some construction debris). Sink was blocked in the first room, and that first afternoon there was no water coming out of the faucets! Water was fine in the 2nd room however I overheard complaints of no hot water, and un-flushable toilets (we definitely had to flush a couple times for everything to go down).

The water park did not open until a couple of days after we arrived.

The food is okay - I am a foodie so was not really expecting amazing meals. I won't make any complaints about the food. It was as expected. The restaurant openings do not align with the schedule shared on the app/website so it was hard to plan meals.

**There are 4 Restaurants:**

**1. Merkado** (buffet) was open for breakfast every morning. Not open for lunch. It was closed a couple evenings. The first night, the front desk told us that is where we could eat that evening as the other restaurants needed reservations. It wasn't even open!

**2. The Grill** (buffet - meats, burgers, hotdogs) seemed to be open every afternoon for lunch, some evenings.

**3. Casa Nostra** (menu based - Italian) open every night. Reservation only, but accept walk-ins if available. Reserve for an early time as they run out of menu items.

**4. Cape Noa** (menu based - Seafood (ish)) closed most evenings we were there, open every morning and afternoon. Serious about their reservations, we could not do a walk-in. We did not get to try their dinner menu as it was closed the majority of our stay. They are open for breakfast for The Level guests. They had some elevated options like berries instead of melons, one day they had little avocado/fruit toast. But mostly have the same things as the Mekardo buffet, if not less.

Yes, we did speak to management about a price-adjustment for The Level concerns but were told to contact the call center (which they could not provide a number or email for).

I’m new to espresso machines, having recently switched from a capsule machine to the Oracle Jet just two days ago. I’m absolutely loving the machine and the quality of espresso it produces! However, I’ve noticed that the tamping on the Oracle Jet doesn’t seem quite up to scratch for me. It’s got me wanting to use a WDT tool and re-tamp before pulling a shot (thanks to watching way too many YouTube videos 🥲)

Do any of you do this? And does it actually make a noticeable difference to the taste of your espresso?

Compared to my old capsule machine, the coffee quality is a huge improvement already. But I’m finding it hard to resist the urge to splurge on the Normcore 53.3mm 7-in-1 Compact Barista Kit with Bottomless Portafilter… This espresso hobby is turning out to be way pricier than I expected!

Do you think that kind of kit is worth it, or is it just overkill? Would love some advice from more experienced home espresso enthusiasts!

But I am happy, or at least very content, and my self-esteem is not tied to society's expectations or what my peers think of me. It seems like people think highly of me anyway, for reasons I'm not sure I can quite put my finger on. Maybe I just know nice people?

I'm, frankly, considered to be pretty intelligent. I aspire to be kind, understanding, not overly judgmental, but those things are on a continuum and it's lifelong process, rather than something one can correctly just describe themselves as being. I'm willing to give everyone the time of day, but I'm also guarded and a part of me is always at least a little skeptical of everyone and everything.

I'm just looking for women to chat with, not out of any desperate need for company, but because I enjoy getting to know new people and finding things I like about them. If you're in the southeast Michigan area I'd be down to get some coffee or a few drinks with you, but the most important thing for me is just meshing well conversationally, which can happen through text too.

At the age of 10, I was told that I was responsible for my 2 year old brother. This meant that I was like his nanny until I left home at 17. 

I got my first job at a fast food restaurant when I was 14. I worked about 16-20 hours a week. I kept up decent grades and was accepted to University. 

I left home when I was 17 and put myself through undergrad and masters. I worked 1 or 2 part time jobs at all times while going to school. Had summer jobs and student loans. 

After my masters I had 6 weeks off for a backpacking trip. Then I started working. 

I worked my way up the corporate ranks to an executive position for the last 25 years. The longest I’ve had off has been 2 weeks. I often worked OT, weekends. 

Long story short, I got a one year salary package six months ago. I cannot remember ever having time off like this without financial worries or responsibilities. 

Since then, my drive seems to be gone. 
I want to do nothing but sleep and catch up on resting. I don’t want to do a single productive thing. 

I am enjoying long cups of coffee while looking out at my view and sleeping in. 

I’d like to re-enter the workforce at some point but am afraid that I won’t be able to do it now that I’ve gotten used to rest.

1hqmycl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hqmycl/i_21f_had_been_seeing_a_guy_21m_for_7_months_he/,I (21F) had been seeing a guy (21M) for 7 months. He blocked me on everything completely out of the blue. Does anyone have similar experiences? What happened?,"I’ve never posted on here before, so I apologize if I make some mistakes. This all happened yesterday/today, and I’m more bewildered than anything. Any insight is appreciated.

Basically, I met this guy, we’ll call him Cam, at the beginning of the summer when I moved to a place where my family regularly vacations for an internship. Cam was from the area and was not in college. For context, this is a pretty rural area in the northern US, so not a ton of opportunities to meet people. We matched on tinder and he asked me to dinner. Our first date lasted four and a half hours, and at the end we both acknowledged that we felt like we really clicked and agreed to do it again sometime. About a week later, we went out for dinner again, and I felt like there was really something there. The conversation flowed, his vibes were good, our goals seemed to align, and I was very attracted to him. On the third date, I met his boss because they happened to be getting drinks at a local bar, and he invited me to join. I went home with Cam and continued to see him for the rest of the summer, but with both of us knowing I would be returning to college several states away come fall. 

Once the summer ended we sort of fell out of touch, but two months later my family had a trip planned to the area for a long weekend. I reached out to Cam and we made a plan to grab drinks and catch up, and I ended up spending the night at his place. He told me he hadn’t been with anyone since me, which I was hesitant to believe, but didn’t think too much of it since we had never discussed exclusivity and he has several jobs with weird hours (blue collar man) so I figured there wouldn’t be much time for him to meet women anyway. 

A few weeks later, he calls and asks when I’m coming back up to visit or if I have plans to get a job there again. I told him I wasn’t sure when I would be back for an extended period of time, but that my family and I would be up there for a bit during the winter. We made a plan to do some things together, and then a few days before I was supposed to go, he told me he wouldn’t be around since he had to travel for one of his jobs. I was disappointed but understood, and since we weren’t officially dating (we had never discussed being official but I had done long distance before and wasn’t keen to try again), I wasn’t really upset with him. I shot him a text when I arrived in his area, and he responded saying that he thought I wasn’t coming for another several weeks and that he was around but would be gone then. I was annoyed at the miscommunication, but glad that I got to see him. I went to a party that one of his friends was hosting and met some people there who were all very friendly and spoke to me as if they knew who I was (“hey, you must be [my name]! thanks for coming by, Cam’s told us a lot about you”), except for a few people who didn’t really acknowledge me (one of them was a man, the other two were girls, probably around our age. I didn’t think much of this at the time but I feel it’s important to mention). 

I went home with him, we sat around and talked for a while, played guitar, and I told him that I liked him. This might be the most naïve thing in the world, but I really did. There had been a few people I’d gone on dates with while back at college, but I felt like nobody compared to him in terms of compatibility or attractiveness. So I had resolved to tell him that I liked him, just to know whether I was wasting my time. I told him I liked him, he said it back, I spent the night there and the morning after he was acting a little odd but he said it was a hangover from the party the night before. Nothing super out of the ordinary, he still made me coffee and warmed up my car and was otherwise normal.

Here’s where things get super weird: I had let his cat out because it was meowing and it had yet to come back by the time we both left his place. I sent him a Snapchat later that day (he asked me to get Snapchat so he was basically the only person I spoke to on there, and even then it was sporadic) asking if the cat had come back (it was cold out so I was worried about it), and he didn’t respond for a few days (this also isn’t that weird for him and I’ve never been bothered by it. I figure he’s busy with work or just isn’t on his phone). Once I got back to my house a few days later, I called him and he didn’t pick up (again, not really a cause for concern) and sent him a text asking about the cat. When I checked my phone about four hours later, he had opened the Snapchat and unadded me, and my text to his phone had not delivered. I tried calling again and it went straight to voicemail. Today I messaged him on Instagram asking what happened, apologizing if I had done/said something upsetting but that I was confused because everything seemed fine when I left, and less than ten minutes later he had blocked me there too.

I’m at a total loss. No explanation I can come up with in my head makes sense. I’m upset because I really did like him, but at the end of the day, I’m young and there are other fish in the sea that won’t treat me like this out of the blue. Some of my friends think that maybe he just got freaked out when I told him I liked him, others think the cat froze to death and he’s mad at me (it used to be a feral cat and it’s now an indoor/outdoor cat, and Cam has a barn so it could go in there), some people think that he has a girlfriend and I’m the secret long-distance side chick (which barely makes sense given how busy he is, but would explain him blocking me). This all just seems super out of character for him and I’ve never been more confused. I apologize if this is long, but I literally saw him on Thursday and we had made plans to see each other again and now I’m blocked on everything.

TLDR: I’d been seeing a guy consistently over the summer and only occasionally since then (since my college is not near where he lives), and I told him I liked him and then he blocked me on everything without any sort of indication as to why. I feel kind of foolish right now.",3,1735675886.0,relationship_advice,3,0.72,False
