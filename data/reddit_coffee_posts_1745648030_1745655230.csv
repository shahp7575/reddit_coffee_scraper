Pregnancy Test Result: Single Live Intrauterine Pregnancy



Species Test: 99% Probability Human



Alone in the doctor’s office while she got me some medicine, I read the simple lines of text several times before they truly made sense.



I was carrying a child.



I looked at the second line again, a smile breaking out across my face. A human baby born of me and Arthur, my fated mate.



I had to tell him right now.



I dialed his number with fingers that shook slightly, glad I was already sitting down. A bubble of happiness swelled up from my heart, and I released it with a laugh. The phone, however, went straight to voicemail, meaning his phone was off.



Swallowing my disappointment but all too aware that Arthur tended to avoid distractions while at work, including just ignoring my calls, I tried to keep my voice cheerful.



“Arthur, it’s Iris. I know you’re busy, and I wish you good luck with the candidacy, but I have some news for you. Great news.”



I pressed my lips shut. Voicemail was not the way I wanted to tell him. News this good needed to be told in person.



“Anyway, please give me a call when you hear this. Love you.”



I hung up and wrapped my arms around myself tightly. I felt ready to explode. If it were a normal day, I would hop in my car and drive to Arthur’s office.



But it wasn’t a normal day. Arthur was meeting with election officials and members of his party to see whether his bid as a presidential candidate would be accepted. A powerful alpha werewolf since his birth, he’d been working toward this goal his whole life, and there was no question he would make an exceptional leader.



This was no time for me to be pestering him, even if this were the best news of my life.



But tonight, when he returned home with his good news, I would tell him mine. Our good news.



The doctor returned with a smile and handed me a bottle. “Take two of these with food twice a day for your nausea.”



“Can you tell how far along I am?” I asked.



“Four weeks. I’d like to see you and your husband back here next week so we can go through your schedule for the next nine months.”



“He’s not my husband yet, but I’m sure he’ll be fine with that.”



She opened a folder and studied some pages in a failed attempt to hide her look of disapproval. “He’s human, I presume?”



“No, an Alpha werewolf,” I said. She looked up in surprise. “We’re fated.”



Her smile looked more genuine now that she knew I wasn’t some “human living off the system” but a future mother fated to mate with a socially prominent werewolf. This was providence working its magic.



“Such a rare and lovely match! Tell Brett to arrange that appointment, but call me if you aren’t feeling better with the medicine.”



I kept smiling as I walked to my car. Arthur would be so happy, and I knew he would be a wonderful partner in this pregnancy.



Although I was human and Arthur was of course a werewolf Alpha, lending him the highest possible social status, I had always believed that we could handle any judgment or prejudice our still somewhat hierarchical society might throw our way.



Because we love each other. Despite our polar opposite upbringings, fate had plans for us, drawing us irrevocably and irresistibly towards each other.



Besides, things were changing. Even fifty years ago a human-werewolf relationship such as ours, fated-mates or not, would have been seen as a laughable embarrassment for any Alpha. Though progress was slow, it was tangible, as humans began to prove themselves worthy of more than just positions of subservience.



Yes, both humans and werewolf-classes alike still preferred to mingle mainly amongst their own kind, Alpha’s being particularly notorious for this, but I had always chosen to focus on the progress, rather than the challenges humans still faced in our society.



On the drive home, I started to think about our wedding plans.



Arthur and I had been together for a year now and moved in together six months ago. It’s quite a long engagement for fated mates, but as a human, I’m fine with taking it slow. Now with the child, I guess we had to think about getting married.



I pulled up in front of our house and looked it over with new eyes. It was a two-bedroom. Would we need to get a bigger place now?



But then, if Arthur were to become the next Alpha President, we’d be living at the President’s Residence in the capital for the next ten years, twenty if he were re-elected. It was enough to make me giddy.



I set my purse down and went into the kitchen. I made myself a cup of herbal tea. No caffeine or alcohol for me for a while. I realized I was humming the Beatles’ song “Penny Lane” and laughed.



“You’re in a good mood,” a familiar and beloved voice said from behind me.



With a little squeal, I turned around, cup in hand. Arthur looked magnificent in his dark gray suit that set off the width of his shoulders and the trim lines of his waist and hips. More than that, he looked happy, his face uplifted by one of his rare deep smiles.



“You got it?”



He gave a little bow. “You are now looking at the latest and greatest candidate for Alpha President.”



I set down the cup and ran to him to wrap him up in a hug. He laughed, a rare event, and kissed me so deeply my toes curled. When he raised his head, I smiled into his face and wondered if our baby would inherit his dark hair and even darker green eyes.



“Your voicemail said you had news as well?” he asked.



I nodded, and it felt like I had champagne in my blood. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the report. Looking puzzled, he took it from me and unfolded it. His eyes scanned the page, and his smile disappeared.



I noticed his body going stiff and his dark brows pulled down in a frown. He looked at me, and his expression was shuttered.



“You're pregnant?” he asked flatly. “With a human fetus?”



“Well, yes, but don’t call it a fetus. It’s our baby, our perfect little baby.”



He looked back down at the test results, and now his eyes were hard and cold.



“Arthur?” I asked, my whole body going cold. “What’s wrong?”Iris POV



I waited for an answer, but Arthur just looked at me, his expression going from cold to unreadable. I was going to insist he say something when someone knocked loudly on our door. Arthur turned and opened the door wide, smiling his professional smile as several people came through.



I recognized some of them from articles and TV interviews where they’d been discussing Arthur’s possible candidacy, but others were strangers. They were all obviously, though not ostentatiously, wealthy, and they were all alphas, except two beta males who acted like assistants to their alpha bosses.



Feeling the pressure to be a gracious hostess, I stepped forward and welcomed them all to our home, but they only made the briefest eye contact with a few nods and then seemed to forget I existed.



“So, you’re the human?” one of them asked with that haughty but not quite insulting disdain I was so used to from alphas. He was about Arthur’s age but not quite as tall and sporting well-coiffed light brown hair.



I said something about my name, but no one seemed to notice that either.



“Why don’t you go upstairs and have a rest?” Arthur turned to me, and I was hoping he would use the moment to introduce me properly, but instead he said, “We can continue what we were talking about later.”



I wanted to protest, to point out that as his future wife and mother to his child I had every reason to remain with these people as they discussed Arthur’s future. But Arthur’s eyes had gone cold, not the ones that I familiar with, and with reluctance I agreed, stepping back from a part of Arthur’s life I had never truly realized before excluded me.



Yes, I thought as I climbed the stairs with what felt like lead in my shoes, my life with Arthur had always been private, but I had never thought he was ashamed of me or wanted to hide me from the other people in his life. Had I been naïve? Those alphas hadn’t treated me with the respect one would give to a housemaid.



I went into the main bedroom to change out of the suit I’d worn to the doctor’s and put on my jeans and paint-splattered smock, which made me feel better right away. My canvas was as I had left it, washes and waves of bright colors that would become the background to the field of wildflowers I was painting to celebrate my recent BA in fine art.



Growing up, I’d always known I wanted to paint. The only true obstacle was money, but I’d worked hard and received several scholarships to get through college in four years.



It took a little longer than usual, but eventually I was lost in my art, what Arthur liked to call my “other-world trance.” The brush was an extension of my body that allowed me to soar and dance.



I was painting in oils, which I ground and mixed up myself, and the images on the canvas were coming together just as I wanted.



I breathed in the smell of linseed oil, which I knew some people found harsh, but it was an old friend to me, like an actor and the smell of greasepaint, I supposed. It was the one area of my life where I had found praise and appreciation even from betas and alphas.



I found myself wondering if any of the Alphas downstairs liked art before sternly telling myself I didn’t need their approval.



I found it much harder to concentrate than usual. I’d been given two great pieces of news with the baby and Arthur’s candidacy, so why was I feeling so alone, so far removed from my mate? I scowled at my canvas. The joy I was trying to show wasn’t coming through; the lines looked uncertain and confused.



I painted undisturbed until the sun went down, powering through until I was a little happier with the painting, if not with my situation in general.



Painting in artificial light had never worked for me, even when my subject was abstract. I crept down to the kitchen and made a sandwich, listening to the murmur of the alpha’s voices in the living room, then went back upstairs and looked over the canvas I was prepping before giving it a good sanding.



I went to bed alone, feeling cold and unsettled. Much later, well past midnight, Arthur joined me, his body a little damp from his nightly shower. Still mostly asleep, I rolled over then and put an arm over his chest. He responded immediately, chuckling softly, and held me back tenderly.



I was half asleep, so it was not a good time to discuss our baby, but I felt my fears dissipate somewhat as he kissed my chin, my forehead, and then my lips. His warm hand ran over my shoulder and around my back, and again I was pleasantly overwhelmed with the sensation of the way my fated mate just fit against my body and, I presume, my soul. He pulled down the strap of might nightgown and kissed my shoulder, then down to my beasts, which he bared to the cool air of the room and his own warm breath.



I shivered, and I felt him smile. But even as I responded to his touch, I wondered how real this was.



I was still feeling that ambivalence the next morning, but I waited Arthur and I both had a little coffee before I asked, “Are you ready to talk about the pregnancy now?”



“Yes, we do need to talk,” he said, “but I have to get to the office.”



“I see. This evening, then?”



He shook his head and looked at his watch. “I have an alpha gathering and fundraiser this evening after work at the Waldorf, so don’t wait up for me.”



“The Waldorf?” I repeated, smiling at him with gritted teeth. “Sounds like fun. I’ve never been there.”



He shrugged and then drained his coffee. “Alphas only, like last night. You wouldn’t have anyone to talk to.”



I wanted to say he could introduce me to his friends and then I would have many people to talk to, but instead I pressed him for at least some feedback about our child.



He took his briefcase off the counter and checked inside. “If you want to keep it, I’ll cover all expenses, of course.”



“Expenses?” I asked, deeply disappointed and not bothering to hide it.



He looked up then. “Children are expensive, and my child should be raised with care and respect. You’ll need to step up for at least this year while I campaign.”



“But we’re fated mates,” I objected. “Shouldn’t we get married when we’re having a child?”



He looked at me sternly. “Voters will not like a human Luna.”



My mouth opened in shock. “That is so discriminatory! You told me you would be running on a platform for human-wolf equality!”



He looked like he restrained himself from rolling his eyes. “There’s a big difference between championing for people’s rights and shoving a human Luna down their throats.”



“What did you just say?” I leapt up from my stool and stood there.



He waved at me, using the motion to check his watch. “Look, I’ll easily be able to give you a million dollars for raising the kid,” he said, lingering slightly on the human slang for “child.” “That’s more than you’ll need.”



I almost threw something at him. “This is about your fatherhood to our child, not money.”



“Look, I have to get to work, and I’ll be working a lot more for a while. You tend to things as you think best.” He stood and grabbed his briefcase, and my anger just kept me standing there to watch him walk out of the kitchen. I heard the door to the garage open and close.



In a sort of fog, I cleaned up the plates from breakfast. What was happening? Was I the mother of his child, his fated mate, and his future wife, or not? And if not, what the hell was I?



I sat on the sofa in the living room, unable even to gather myself enough to paint. Nothing made any sense, and everything I had thought my life was wasn’t real. I was too stunned even to cry.



There was a brisk knock then, and I walked robotically to the front door, wondering if Arthur had forgotten something. A tall, beautiful alpha woman stood there.



“Hello?” I asked her. “May I help you? Who are you?”



“Oh, I’m Selina,” She said with a polished smile, “Arthur’s fiancée. I came to see who I’ll be sharing my husband with.”  
Iris POV



“What?” I asked, though I wasn’t any more shocked than I had been before opening the door.



Life had lost its context. This was just something on top of what had already occurred.



“May I come in?” she asked even as she strode past me with a whip of blond hair and whiff of expensive perfume. I watched from behind as she walked to the sofa, her long legs impeccably cased in black velvet pants and her top covered in wispy layers of purple silk. She set herself down.



“Do you have any coffee?” she asked.



“You’re going to marry Arthur?” I asked as I pushed the front door closed.



“Yes, and soon.” She looked smug. “At first, of course, when I heard he had some human lover he adored, I said no way, but then the situation was explained to me, and well, being Luna isn’t something one just turns down, is it?”



She frowned and looked at the armchair that so perfectly matched the sofa. “Aren’t you going to sit down?”



I walked over to the chair and sat. My feet felt a little numb, and so did my fingers.



“So,” she said the second I was in the chair, “he’s told me you’re pregnant, so obviously we need to talk about that. Also, do you have some sort of career you’re pursuing?”



“I think I need to talk to Arthur before you and I talk further,” I said.



“Call him,” she said with a shrug.



It was difficult to retrieve my phone from my pocket and dial Arthur with my numb fingers, but I managed it. It went to voicemail.



“I need to wait for him to see my number and call back.”



Selina snorted, looked at me with pity, and then pulled out her phone, which I saw she put on speaker after dialing a number. It rang twice.



“Yes, Selina?” Arthur’s voice asked, and my stomach sank. It was clear which of us Arthur took seriously.



“Honey,” she said, smiling at me in triumph. “What time are we going to see the engagement dress and rings tomorrow?”



Arthur sounded a bit impatient but replied, “Ten-thirty.”



“I’ve already booked the seaside mansion for the engagement party.”



“Do whatever you want,” he said, and I could see the expression easily on his face. “I’m hanging up.”



She made a little-girl face and spoke in a slightly higher voice. “Haven’t you told your little lover about this yet?”



“Her name is Iris.”



Selina raised her eyebrows at me as if to say I should be happy he admitted it. I didn’t care.



“And I told you, she doesn’t need to know.”



“Aren’t you afraid she’ll leave you once she finds out?”



“She needs my money.” Arthur’s response was quick and certain. “With student loans and a child on the way, how could she leave?”



Ah, I thought, and I found myself nodding as some things started to make sense, not the least was his offer of a million dollars to meet my “need.” That was evidently how he really saw me: not a future artist he was helping to meet her goals but just some gold-digging parasite. Did he think our child was a parasite too?



Selina was still talking into the phone “About the child, I’ve thought it over. I don’t want Iris to give birth before our wedding. It would be a scandal.”



“Forcing a woman to have an abortion is illegal, even a human one.” I noticed his tone was angry. He was probably worried people would find out and it would hurt his campaign. “Be careful you don’t end up in jail.”



So. Numb throughout my body now, I tried to make myself accept that Arthur didn’t want the child, and his only concern was avoiding legal trouble. I opened my mouth to tell him I was there and had heard every word, but Selina just made a kiss-kiss noise into the phone and ended the call.



“Well, I can’t force you, it’s true,” she said to me, “but you really need to scrape that thing out of you before it causes Arthur trouble. Besides, that my husband will have a human mistress is bad enough; I don’t need a child in the mix.”



She flung her hair behind her left shoulder, a well-practiced move. “Well, Arthur obviously doesn’t want to be the villain here, so as his fiancé, I will, but not heartlessly.” She laughed with a little trill.



“You’ll be living with us, I suppose, so the best story will be for you to be my assistant. I have one already, but another would be helpful.” She shrugged. “So, while I get a contract drawn up complete with NDA, get the fetus aborted and name your price.”



OK, even as a human facing an alpha, I had my limits about being humiliated.



“I’ll take a billion dollars at the end of the week to start, and then we can discuss my salary.”



Selina looked at me as though I’d peed on her shoe, which actually would be quite satisfying.



“I can’t get a billion dollars together in a week!”



I told her, “Then you can’t afford my child or afford me as your assistant.”



“This is ridiculous,” she announced, standing and flinging the strap of her Channel purse over her shoulder. “I’ll have Arthur deal with you.” In a few long strides of her legs, she left, slamming the door shut behind her.



Or rather, she would have, but I caught the door and called after her, “But don’t worry, I just want to talk to Arthur one more time. If Arthur really just wants to keep me as a mistress, I’ll leave soon.”



She didn’t bother to answer, probably thinking I was saying I’d leave to bargain for money.



I didn’t want money. I didn’t want some alpha woman smiling while she destroyed my life. I wanted an explanation, a conversation. I wanted to know my relationship with my fated mate wasn’t going to end so poorly.



But then Selina paused and turned with an even bigger smile than before. “You should attend the party this evening. There, you can talk to Arthur all you like.”



“Arthur said it was alphas-only.”



She laughed. “There will be plenty of your rank there, trust me.” Then she executed a perfect runway turn and walked toward a red sports car parked on the street.



I remembered the party would be at the Waldorf, so I didn’t have to ask anyone for the address.



Alone in the house, I bathed and shaved my legs and spent way too much time on my makeup. I had a very nice party dress in a red so deep it looked almost black, off the shoulder with a full skirt, a classic. I put it on almost defiantly, trying to find more strength inside.



I was going to a party, and I was going to enjoy it, damn it. I slid into my best shoes and called for an Uber.



The Waldorf was ablaze with lights and sparkling people. I went to the front door with my chin up and walked through the lobby refusing to make eye contact with anyone. At the door of the ballroom itself, however, I was stopped by a hotel employee dressed in red and black.



“Excuse me, miss,” he said. “Humans require an alpha escort beyond this point.”



That strength I had stoked up inside drained away. Even dressed to the nines, I was being rejected out of hand. I stared at his polite but distant eyes. He was an omega, it was easy to see. I wanted to touch him to see if he flinched from being sullied by a mere human like me.



This is Arthur’s world, I thought, something I had never thought before during all our time together. He thinks I have no place here. Maybe he’s right.



“Iris?”

I had drunkenly matched with a guy on Tinder who had a believable profile. He asked for my Snapchat and we exchanged. He seemed trustworthy (for my naive, drunk self) and I also exchanged numbers believing we were going to have coffee on a later day. We then both exchanged selfies, later escalating to more revealing photos (however, my face is not in the photo I sent). He instantly blocked me on every app besides my phone number, and demanded $500 stating that he would send my photos my university (I didn’t realize my instagram was attached to my tinder, and he must’ve found it through my bio).

However I instantly blocked him. He proceeded to message me with a different number, which I then proceeded to block again, also making it clear to him that both numbers and profiles and accounts were reported to ReportFraud. I also know he cannot access my followers or friends because all my accounts are private (and if he did, he would’ve threatened me with that, instead of using my university as leverage). If my university is sent anything, they would instantly block/ignore it (there are some policies from what I heard). 

Am I in the clear? I’ve definitely learned my lesson with this encounter, as well as learning to never touch dating apps while under the influence. I also understand that the probability of having my photos leaked is pretty low—considering the scammer has no connection to my followers or friends. ",1,1745654904.0,Sextortion,1,1.0,False

A cold, icy voice cut through the silence. ""Isis, you've been wearing the title of my wife for way too long. It's time you hand it back to Layla Wilson.""

Isis Moore couldn't believe her ears. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined her husband would be the one to take her life.

Her stomach twisted in pain, while Adrian Anderson held Layla Wilson in his arms, her eyes gleaming with smug satisfaction.

""Isis, don't worry. I'll take good care of Adrian from now on,"" Layla said, her voice dripping with condescension.

Isis stared at them in utter disbelief, her voice shaking. ""You... you... how could you do this?""

She knew Layla—Adrian's coworker, his college classmate. But she'd never imagined they'd end up together like this. Never thought they'd betray her so brutally.

Adrian just snorted, his voice cold and detached. ""Let me put it bluntly. Layla's my first love. I've always loved her, not you.""

The truth hit her like a punch to the gut. Blood rushed to her mouth, dark and thick, spilling out in a violent cough.

Her eyes went wide with disbelief. ""If you loved her, why the hell did you even marry me?""

She remembered it all—how Adrian had chased her, how he'd convinced her to be with him. She'd given him everything—her heart, her trust, all of herself.

Even though his family wasn't well-off, she never complained. She admired his drive, his ambition—but now, she realized it was never for her.

She'd always tried to take care of him, never once spending his money. She'd handled everything for their home, from renovations to furniture. It was all her effort, her blood, sweat, and tears.

Adrian had even brought his parents and sister to live with them, and she never said a word about it. She'd treated them like her own family—better than a full-time nanny.

When Adrian had said, ""I want you to stay home and take care of everything while I work,"" she gave up her career in a heartbeat, putting everything into caring for their family.

And now? Now she was getting his cold, heartless words. ""I've always loved her, not you."" It felt like a slap in the face.

Adrian looked at her with nothing but disgust, like she was dirt beneath his shoes. He didn't even bother to answer.

Layla, on the other hand, opened her mouth, practically gloating, as though she'd won some twisted prize.

She said, ""Don't play the victim. You're the one who ruined everything. You made sure I saw you with Adrian, which is why I left the country in a fit. If you hadn't done that, you wouldn't even be in the picture.""

Layla was practically foaming at the mouth with anger, but Isis was completely lost.

'When did I ever set up something like that?' she thought. Back when she was with Adrian, he was always alone—there was never anyone else.

Isis opened her mouth to defend herself, but the moment she did, a violent coughing fit overtook her, blood spilling from her lips. She glanced at Adrian, but he didn't even flinch. He was completely siding with Layla.

In that moment, everything clicked. There were no reasons. They just needed a convenient excuse to justify their betrayal.

""Adrian...Why..."" Isis's eyes widened in shock, struggling to hold back the excruciating pain as she demanded, ""Why the hell are you doing this to me?

""Even if you love her, even if you want to marry her... I gave up everything for you—why the hell would you want me dead?""

Adrian's eyes turned dark, filled with pure malice. He leaned in close to her ear, his voice cold and venomous. ""You're such an idiot. If you don't die, how am I supposed to get my hands on the Moore family fortune?""

Isis felt like the world had just come crashing down on her. So, all this time, his pursuit, his proposal, it was all about her family's money.

'How fucking pathetic...' Isis let out a bitter laugh, blood staining her lips. 'I thought this was love... real love...'

Adrian's eyes gleamed with cold fury. ""This is all your fault, Isis. Don't blame anyone else. If you had just handed over the inheritance, we wouldn't be here.""

His voice was devoid of emotion—no affection, no warmth—just pure, heartless calculation.

Layla stood next to him, her arms crossed and a cruel sneer on her face. ""Adrian, stop wasting time with this bitch. Just shove the poison down her throat already—we've got a prenatal checkup to get to.""

Isis's heart slammed in her chest. 'Prenatal checkup? They... they are already having a kid?'

Layla's hand rested smugly on her flat stomach, a look of pure satisfaction in her eyes.

Isis could barely process it—her whole world was falling apart. But there was no time for that now. Adrian grabbed her face and shoved the last dose of poison into her mouth, eyes burning with hatred.

As soon as the poison hit, a wave of pain ripped through her insides. It felt like her organs were being torn apart. The agony was unbearable.

She couldn't speak anymore. Couldn't even move. All she could do was endure, feel her life slipping away, bit by bit.

Regret swallowed her whole. She had given everything for him—sacrificed her family, her dignity, her freedom—and in return, she got... nothing.

It wasn't worth a damn thing.

As darkness overtook her, she closed her eyes. If she ever got another shot at life, she'd never fall for Adrian's lies again.

Then, a flash of white light exploded before her eyes.

And suddenly—BANG! BANG! BANG! Urgent pounding on the door echoed in her ears.

""Isis! Open the door!""

# Chapter 2 Let's Get A Divorce

Isis jolted awake, her heart pounding. 'Wait... didn't I already die?'

But when she opened her eyes, everything around her—the same old wedding bedroom she shared with Adrian—was exactly the way it had been.

She was completely thrown off, wondering if she was still stuck in some kind of dream.

But then, the sound of someone banging on the door snapped her back to reality. ""Isis! Come on, open the door!"" The voice was so sharp and real, it cut through her confusion.

She pinched herself hard, and the sharp sting was all the proof she needed. This wasn't a dream.

Her eyes darted to the clock on the wall, and the date hit her like a ton of bricks. It was the fifth day since she married Adrian.

'Wait... did I just time travel?' The thought smacked her upside the head. She jumped out of bed and rushed to the door.

Standing outside was Adrian's little sister, Alice Anderson, looking pissed as hell. ""What the hell took you so long? I need my tuition money, like, now.""

Isis smirked coldly. Of course, everything was just as she remembered.

It was the fifth day after her marriage to Adrian. It seemed like fate was cutting her some slack. She hadn't gone back before marrying him, but it was better late than never.

This time, she wasn't going to let the Anderson family walk all over her.

Isis looked Alice up and down, her expression hardening. She'd treated Alice like a real sister once, but what had Alice done? Used her like an ATM.

With ice in her voice, Isis shot back, ""Not a chance."" Then, without another word, she slammed the door in Alice's face.

On the other side, Alice was frozen in shock. 'Did I just hear that right? Isis actually said she's not paying my tuition? Has she completely lost it?'

Fuming, Alice stomped downstairs and barged into the living room where her mom, Zoe Anderson, was sipping her coffee like nothing was wrong. ""Mom, Isis won't pay my tuition.""

Zoe let out a scoffing laugh. ""No way. She's always been the one to give in to us. There's no way she's saying no now.""

Alice's confusion was evident. ""I'm telling you, she really said no.""

""Mom, do you think... maybe Isis finally got what she wanted—married my brother—and now she's changed? Was everything she did for us just an act?"" Alice's voice wavered with doubt.

Zoe put her coffee cup down, raising an eyebrow. ""I seriously doubt it. She's been obsessed with your brother from the start.

""Hell, she bought this whole place with her own money and only put your brother's name on the deed. No way she was faking that.""

Alice immediately saw the point. ""So she still dared to pull that crap with me? Hell no! I'm going to give her a piece of my mind!""

Isis had always been the calm, collected type, never one to lose her temper. But the icy, indifferent way she'd acted earlier really threw Alice for a loop. For a moment, Alice forgot to argue altogether.

Zoe quickly intervened. ""Forget it, let's just wait for your brother to get back. He'll know how to handle her—teach Isis a lesson she won't forget.""

Zoe had her own plans. Alice's tuition needed to be paid, not to mention Grandma Naomi Anderson's VIP hospital bills. Zoe couldn't afford to go to war with Isis just yet.

And, to top it all off, the Anderson family's business was at a critical stage. Both William and Adrian Anderson had mentioned needing a huge cash injection, fast.

All of that depended on Isis Moore. Zoe knew that if they were going to get anything from her, it was going to have to be through Adrian.

\*\*\*\*\*

Isis closed the door behind her and sat down, trying to process the whirlwind of events that had just unfolded.

Before everything went sideways, she'd only been married to Adrian for three months when he tried to poison her. But even before that, she'd been slowly poisoned for a while. Maybe even set up in this life.

But she wasn't sweating it. The poison wasn't fatal unless triggered by another substance, and even though she was already poisoned, she wasn't in any real danger.

What mattered now was getting a divorce from Adrian and getting back everything she'd sacrificed for the Anderson family.

Later that night, when Adrian came home and heard about everything, he immediately flew off the handle. ""Isis! What the hell is wrong with you?!""

He kicked open her door. ""Why didn't you pay Alice's tuition?!""

Isis gave him a cold, dead-eyed look, trying to suppress the boiling anger inside. ""Because I don't want to.""

Adrian froze, blinking. 'What? What the hell? Isis, what kind of attitude is that? Has she completely lost it?'

Realizing he still needed money from her, Adrian sneered, ""Look, I'm giving you one chance. Go apologize to Alice, pay her tuition and Grandma's hospital fees, and I'll let it slide.""

Isis couldn't hold back her laughter. She didn't even blink. ""Not happening. I don't need you to let it slide.""

Adrian lost it. He pointed at her, practically spitting with rage. ""Isis! Don't think just because we're married, everything's smooth sailing! You should know, we can always get a divorce!""

Isis just nodded, not missing a beat. ""Fine. Let's get divorced then.""

Adrian's jaw dropped. He stared at her, shocked. There was no way she was serious. She had to be out of her mind.

""You're really crazy,"" he spat, and turned to walk out.

It wasn't that he didn't want the divorce—it was just that the timing wasn't right yet.

Isis laughed bitterly to herself as she watched him leave. What a coward. He couldn't even say the word ""divorce"" himself.

Just then, Sophie Perry, the housekeeper, walked in slowly, her face full of concern. ""Mrs. Anderson, are you alright?""

""I'm fine, Sophie. I'm getting a divorce,"" Isis said flatly, but with a steely resolve.

Sophie blinked, stunned. ""Are you... sure? Did something happen?""

Anyone else might not have understood, but Sophie, who had been with Isis since she was little, knew how deeply Isis had loved Adrian.

Since they'd started dating, Isis had been completely devoted to him. When they decided to get married, Adrian had moved his entire family in, and Isis had treated them like her own, taking care of them without question.

The Anderson family's business had been struggling until Isis stepped in, using her resources to help the company skyrocket.

Once Zoe Anderson moved into the villa and the company took off, she started living like a high-society lady—demanding only the best. She even spent money like it was nothing just to fit in with the elite wives of Sans City.

Alice, on the other hand, had always been about luxury and status. She could've gone to a public school, but insisted on going to an expensive private one. She'd constantly begged Isis for favors.

Because they were family, Isis had agreed. But after that, the Andersons never brought up Alice's tuition again, leaving Isis to foot the bill.

And let's not forget Adrian's grandma Naomi Anderson, who practically lived in the VIP ward of the hospital. Isis was the one paying for her treatment, while the Andersons couldn't care less.

Isis had given so much for Adrian. They'd finally gotten married. But now, just five days into the marriage, she was already talking about divorce.

Sophie couldn't believe it.

A bitter, self-mocking smile spread across Isis's face as she looked up at Sophie. Her eyes were hard with determination. ""Sophie, I've made up my mind. I'm divorcing him.""

Sophie was the housekeeper who'd raised Isis like a daughter. So after Isis was killed by the Andersons in her past life, Sophie wasn't having it.

She threw a fit, demanding they do an autopsy to prove the truth, but the Andersons just sold her out—shipped her off to some remote, godforsaken mountain where she was tortured for god knows how long until it broke her and drove her insane.

Just thinking about it made Isis's eyes sting with tears. Because of her own damn mistakes, Sophie had to suffer too. This time around, she swore she would protect Sophie—no matter what.

# Chapter 3 Why Should I Cook?

When the Anderson family found out that Adrian hadn't just failed to patch things up with Isis but had come back empty-handed—and, to make matters worse, she'd actually asked for a divorce—everyone was completely stunned.

Zoe rushed over to her son. ""No way you can divorce her, Adrian! We haven't even gotten all the perks from the Moore family yet! Don't be a fool.""

William nodded, agreeing with his wife. ""Exactly. Our company's barely scraping by. We've got to keep Isis in check. No two ways about it.""

Adrian, already frustrated beyond belief, muttered, ""She actually asked for a divorce? If I go along with that, I'll look like a complete idiot. Does she seriously think I can't live without her?""

Truth was, he had never really been all that into her.

If Layla hadn't gone abroad when she did, leaving him heartbroken, he wouldn't have given Isis a second thought. But Isis came into his life, cared for him in ways no one else did, and he ended up marrying her.

But later Layla was back in town, just when he was about to tie the knot with Isis, it felt like everything was a mess. He regretted how things had played out.

There had been moments when he seriously thought about asking for a divorce. But the perks Isis brought to the table—they were way too important to throw away.

His whole family was dead set against him ending things, and he couldn't afford to risk that.

At least, not yet.

So he buried his feelings for Layla deep down and decided to stick with Isis.

'But now, after all that, for Isis to pull this crap right after we got married? What the hell?' Adrian thought. He stormed out of the room, seething with anger.

William and Zoe exchanged looks as they watched him leave, both of them sighing heavily. ""He's off again! And we still haven't even gotten the damn tuition money!""

William let out a long sigh. ""Tuition's peanuts. That's just 100 thousand dollars. The real problem is Mom's hospital bills—one million at least.""

Zoe, shaking her head in frustration, pointed at Adrian's retreating back. ""How the hell does he not know how to handle Isis? He had her eating out of his hand before. But now? Ever since Layla came back, it's like he's completely lost it!

""Bet he's off to chase after that little temptress Layla again.""

Zoe was beyond furious now, and her thoughts were a whirlwind of anger. 'What the hell does Layla have that my son can't get over? He was seriously losing her mind.'

William furrowed his brow, clearly worried. ""At this rate, sooner or later, Isis's gonna figure it out. I heard from Adrian that they've been married for five days, and they haven't even slept together. Don't you think she's gonna start asking questions?""

Zoe was boiling with anger. 'Ugh, this stupid son of mine—why the hell does he always chicken out when it's time to take action?'

She asked, ""What the hell do we do now?""

William let out a heavy sigh, frustration written all over his face. He knew that if Isis figured things out, they were totally screwed. He had seen firsthand everything she'd done for them over the past couple of years.

With her money and connections, she had turned their failing business into one of the top companies in Sans City. Their assets had skyrocketed, growing by a hundred times.

If Adrian hadn't been so obsessed with marrying Layla, they wouldn't even be considering letting go of Isis. She was their cash cow.

Adrian stepped out the door and ran straight into Layla, who was holding a gift.

""Adrian? You heading out?"" Layla asked, a little surprised.

The second Adrian saw her, all his anger seemed to evaporate. He softened, flashing a smile that was completely different from the one he had when dealing with Isis. ""Layla, what's up? What are you doing here?""

Layla, looking sweet and graceful in a white dress, raised the gift with a smile. ""I heard Zoe likes the pastries from this place, so I thought I'd bring some over.""

Adrian's heart immediately softened. ""Layla, you're too good to them.""

Layla blushed, her smile warm. ""Adrian, your family's my family. I should be doing nice things for them.""

Adrian looked around and realized they were still standing outside. Fighting the urge to pull her into his arms, he said, ""Come on, let's go inside. You staying for dinner?""

Layla smiled brightly, following him in like the perfect little wife.

As they walked through the luxurious villa, a dark flicker crossed her eyes. 'Just wait, I'll be the one running this place soon.'

Inside, Zoe and William exchanged a look as Adrian returned with Layla trailing behind him. They weren't sure how to react. They hadn't even managed to fix things with Isis yet, and now Adrian had brought Layla home.

When Zoe realized that Layla had come all the way to bring her gifts, her face softened, and she broke into a warm smile, inviting Layla to sit down.

After all, this wasn't the first time Layla had joined them at the table.

After coming back from studying abroad, Layla had joined the hospital where Adrian worked—and she'd actually climbed the ranks faster than him. Since they'd been classmates, she'd quickly become a regular at the Anderson household.

Adrian didn't exactly have a high-profile job at the hospital. He mostly went there because of his medical background, but also to help the Anderson family expand their business.

The Andersons were deep in healthcare, so having connections in the hospital was key for the company's success.

As Zoe casually suggested that Layla stay for dinner, she asked, ""Where's Isis? Go tell her to come down and help with dinner!""

At the mention of Isis, Adrian's face immediately darkened. He remembered how she'd acted earlier, and he muttered, clearly pissed off, ""I'm not asking her.""

Zoe, clearly frustrated, had no choice but to head upstairs herself. When she found Isis, her tone was uncharacteristically sweet. ""Isis, Adrian's colleague Layla is here. Could you please make a few extra dishes for dinner tonight?""

Isis normally handled all the cooking, even though they had a housekeeper who could cook. But every meal was meticulously planned and prepared by her.

As soon as Isis heard that Layla was coming over, her eyes narrowed with a cold, hard edge.

In her past life, Layla had been a regular guest at their house, always claiming to be Adrian's colleague and classmate. Isis had trusted her completely, even going out of her way to make Layla's favorite dishes every time.

Little did she know, she'd been unwittingly playing hostess to Adrian's mistress.

'I can't believe how fucking blind I was back then,' she thought bitterly.

When Isis didn't respond, Zoe's patience snapped. ""Did you hear me? Why the hell are you just standing there?""

Isis snapped back to reality and, seeing Zoe's disgusted expression, shot back coldly, ""I'm not going.""

Zoe froze. ""What did you just say?""

Isis's voice was like ice. ""I said, I'm not going. We've got a housekeeper, don't we? Why the hell should I cook?""

Zoe stood there, completely stunned. 'Is she out of her damn mind?'

# Chapter 4 Stream Cut

When Zoe heard Adrian mention that Isis was thinking about divorcing him, her instincts kicked in immediately.

She could tell by Isis's face that this wasn't some emotional outburst—it had to be something serious that pushed her to this point.

'But a divorce right now? That's not the smartest move...' Zoe thought to herself, surprisingly calm.

Instead of arguing with Isis, she just turned and walked off. 'It's just a meal, right? I don't even need to lift a finger, and I'll still make her pay.'

Back at the hall, Zoe didn't waste any time cooking. Instead, she ordered a ridiculously expensive meal from Sans City's top Regal Hotel. Foie gras, lobster, rib-eye steak, caviar—the whole nine yards.

She wasn't a VIP, so she couldn't just get delivery, but Zoe knew how to work her connections, and a call to Hannah White in her circle had it all arranged.

Zoe wasn't shy about spending money, though. In her mind, the bill was definitely going to land on Isis's lap.

Thinking that Isis would be the one footing the bill, Zoe cheerfully asked Adrian to invite her to join them for dinner. But Isis, consumed by thoughts of divorce, wasn't in the mood to share a meal with them.

Still, noticing the vibe in the Anderson household, she realized that tonight wasn't the right time to bring up the divorce. So, she decided to get the lay of the land, see exactly how her soon-to-be-ex and his mistress were secretly working together.

As she came downstairs, Isis spotted Layla sitting next to Zoe, both of them chatting and getting along like old pals.

When Adrian and Isis walked down, Layla froze.

Isis was dressed simply in white loungewear, her long hair flowing like seaweed, and her face was fresh and naturally stunning. Adrian, in equally casual clothes, walked beside her, and they looked every bit like the perfect couple.

Layla's face went ghostly white, even worse than when she'd used a ton of foundation to hide her imperfections. She'd worn a pretty dress and spent ages perfecting her makeup, hoping to steal the spotlight from Isis.

But to her surprise, Isis looked effortlessly beautiful, with not a single drop of makeup.

And the thing was, Isis's beauty came so naturally, she gave off this undeniable ""I belong here"" energy. Layla, on the other hand, despite all her prep, looked like a guest crashing the party.

Frustration bubbled up in Layla.

""Adrian, Isis, you're here! Come sit, come sit!"" Zoe beamed at them, practically glowing with excitement.

Layla quickly snapped out of it and greeted them in a sweet voice, ""Adrian, Isis.""

She and Isis had seen each other a few times before, and Layla always used that same friendly tone. But this time, Isis caught the subtle chill in her voice and couldn't help but smile a little too smugly.

Instead of getting upset, Isis just smiled and said, ""You're Adrian's colleague, right? Well, we're not exactly close, so you can call me 'Mrs. Anderson.'""

Since they weren't officially divorced yet, Isis had no problem playing the role of Adrian's wife and throwing in a little jab at Layla.

As expected, Layla's face went even paler, and her smile froze in place. The word ""Mrs. Anderson"" felt like a lump stuck in her throat, making her feel downright disgusted.

Adrian's face also darkened, but given his situation with Isis, he knew he couldn't argue with that, so he stayed quiet.

Layla stood frozen, her lip caught between her teeth, eyes burning with a mix of humiliation and anger as she stared at Adrian.

Adrian met her gaze, regret washing over him. The whole situation felt like a tragedy unfolding between two lovers doomed by fate, and it tugged at the hearts of anyone witnessing it.

The tension in the air was thick, almost unbearable. Zoe, sensing the heavy silence, jumped in to break it. ""Alright, enough standing around. Let's sit down and eat.""

She didn't say ""Mrs. Anderson""—but Isis wasn't looking for that kind of acknowledgment. Her goal was clear: make Layla squirm.

At the dinner table, William took the head of the table, with Zoe beside him. Layla sat next to Zoe. Isis, taking her seat directly across from Layla, was technically supposed to sit beside Adrian, but he wasn't having any of it.

Without hesitation, Adrian slid into the seat next to Layla, his expression softening just a touch. Layla's eyes flickered with a momentary satisfaction, but it was gone in an instant. Isis, ever sharp, caught it.

Isis glanced up, her eyes unreadable, taking in the scene with a glance. Without a word, she stood and moved to Adrian's usual spot, silently making her point that he wasn't taking it—he could lower his own status if he wanted to.

William and Zoe caught the shift. They exchanged a look, both noticing how Adrian and Layla were chatting like no one else mattered.

They shook their heads, unimpressed. 'This kid's got no clue,' William thought. 'He's the head of the family and Isis's husband—how the hell does he think it's fine to sit next to another woman?'

Clearing his throat, William nudged Adrian. ""Adrian, you and Layla can talk shop after dinner. Sit here, let's eat!""

""Huh?"" Adrian looked up, confused.

It wasn't until he saw his dad keep pointing at the empty seat next to Isis that it finally clicked—right, he was still married to her. He was supposed to sit next to her.

Frustration bubbled up in Adrian. This family dynamic shit was a nightmare to him. He could feel his parents' disapproval radiating from across the table, so he reluctantly got up and moved next to Isis.

'Great, Layla's gonna be pissed again,' he thought, letting out a frustrated sigh.

William had hoped his son would sit next to him, but with Isis already having made a move, they weren't about to push it further.

Layla's smugness quickly evaporated, replaced by a bitter sting. Watching Adrian sit next to Isis made her blood boil.

Especially when she took a closer look at Isis. Her skin was flawless—like porcelain, so delicate it looked like it might break if touched. Layla couldn't help but feel a jolt of jealousy. She was stunning, no denying it.

As dinner began, Isis eyed the spread Zoe had put together. 'Wow, this is a feast,' she thought. The lobster and beef—definitely from Regal Hotel's chefs—showed the Andersons weren't cutting corners.

Isis remembered the holiday meals when she and Adrian were together—nothing close to this. The difference in status was glaring.

Zoe, sensing an opportunity, showered Layla with attention, piling her plate high and chatting like they were mother and daughter.

Isis ate quietly, her gaze observing the whole performance with calm detachment.

William turned to Layla. ""So, I hear you're the chief physician at St. Stephen's now?""

Layla smiled modestly. ""Sort of. I'm acting chief for now, but I'll be confirmed in six months.""

William smiled back, clearly impressed. ""That's pretty impressive!"" He seemed to be imagining all the perks of having a chief physician in the family for their business.

Adrian, hearing the praise for Layla, straightened up. ""Layla studied abroad. Her medical skills are top-tier—better than most of the chief physicians at St. Stephen's!"" His admiration was obvious.

Back in school, Layla had been the top student, and Adrian had fallen for her the moment he laid eyes on her. Since then, she'd always been ""the one"" to him.

William and Zoe couldn't stop showering Layla with praise. ""Dr. Wilson, you're seriously impressive!""

In their minds, with a daughter-in-law like her, the Anderson family's future looked damn bright.

Compared to Isis, who seemed more and more useless to them, Layla was a powerhouse—smart, successful, and a perfect fit for their son.

""This isn't even her best skill!"" Adrian added, his eyes lighting up. ""Layla's biggest talent is in Stream Cut—it's an incredibly advanced technique. Only a handful of doctors in the world can do it. She's a medical prodigy!""

Once again, William and Zoe were all smiles, nodding like proud parents.

But when Isis heard ""Stream Cut,"" her eyes narrowed. 'Stream Cut? Layla knows how to do that?'

She was taken aback. She'd never heard of it before. Thinking back to her past life, she realized she'd been too caught up in running the kitchen that night to catch wind of this.

Forcing herself to keep it together, Isis feigned curiosity. ""Stream Cut? Sounds pretty impressive. Where did you learn it, Dr. Wilson?""

Layla shot her a look full of disdain. ""Didn't know you were into medical techniques, Isis. Did you study anything even remotely related to medicine in college?""

Adrian scoffed. ""Hell, she didn't even go to college, let alone study medicine!""

Layla acted like she was shocked. ""Wait, Isis didn't make it into college?""

'In this day and age, people still don't go to college? No wonder she ended up just a housewife,' Layla thought to herself, looking down on Isis with silent judgment.

Isis wasn't fazed in the slightest, sipping her coffee like she couldn't care less. ""I told you, just call me 'Mrs. Anderson.' Why are you still calling me by my first name, Dr. Wilson?""

Layla, who had been basking in a sense of superiority, immediately felt awkward when she heard those words.

Isis's comment was a cold reminder that, no matter how useless she seemed, she was still, at the end of the day, Adrian's wife.

Adrian, clearly pissed off, shot back coldly, ""Well, considering Layla's about to be my boss, I think you can forget the whole 'Mrs. Anderson' thing.""

Isis let out a dry laugh. They couldn't even be bothered to fake it for a second. In her past life, she had been so blind, stupidly thinking their ""friendship"" was just that—nothing more.

Right then, Alice, who'd been quietly eating, chimed in, ""Isis, you still haven't paid me for my tuition!""",1,1745654583.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1 Always Love Her

A cold, icy voice cut through the silence. ""Isis, you've been wearing the title of my wife for way too long. It's time you hand it back to Layla Wilson.""

Isis Moore couldn't believe her ears. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined her husband would be the one to take her life.

Her stomach twisted in pain, while Adrian Anderson held Layla Wilson in his arms, her eyes gleaming with smug satisfaction.

""Isis, don't worry. I'll take good care of Adrian from now on,"" Layla said, her voice dripping with condescension.

Isis stared at them in utter disbelief, her voice shaking. ""You... you... how could you do this?""

She knew Layla—Adrian's coworker, his college classmate. But she'd never imagined they'd end up together like this. Never thought they'd betray her so brutally.

Adrian just snorted, his voice cold and detached. ""Let me put it bluntly. Layla's my first love. I've always loved her, not you.""

The truth hit her like a punch to the gut. Blood rushed to her mouth, dark and thick, spilling out in a violent cough.

Her eyes went wide with disbelief. ""If you loved her, why the hell did you even marry me?""

She remembered it all—how Adrian had chased her, how he'd convinced her to be with him. She'd given him everything—her heart, her trust, all of herself.

Even though his family wasn't well-off, she never complained. She admired his drive, his ambition—but now, she realized it was never for her.

She'd always tried to take care of him, never once spending his money. She'd handled everything for their home, from renovations to furniture. It was all her effort, her blood, sweat, and tears.

Adrian had even brought his parents and sister to live with them, and she never said a word about it. She'd treated them like her own family—better than a full-time nanny.

When Adrian had said, ""I want you to stay home and take care of everything while I work,"" she gave up her career in a heartbeat, putting everything into caring for their family.

And now? Now she was getting his cold, heartless words. ""I've always loved her, not you."" It felt like a slap in the face.

Adrian looked at her with nothing but disgust, like she was dirt beneath his shoes. He didn't even bother to answer.

Layla, on the other hand, opened her mouth, practically gloating, as though she'd won some twisted prize.

She said, ""Don't play the victim. You're the one who ruined everything. You made sure I saw you with Adrian, which is why I left the country in a fit. If you hadn't done that, you wouldn't even be in the picture.""

Layla was practically foaming at the mouth with anger, but Isis was completely lost.

'When did I ever set up something like that?' she thought. Back when she was with Adrian, he was always alone—there was never anyone else.

Isis opened her mouth to defend herself, but the moment she did, a violent coughing fit overtook her, blood spilling from her lips. She glanced at Adrian, but he didn't even flinch. He was completely siding with Layla.

In that moment, everything clicked. There were no reasons. They just needed a convenient excuse to justify their betrayal.

""Adrian...Why..."" Isis's eyes widened in shock, struggling to hold back the excruciating pain as she demanded, ""Why the hell are you doing this to me?

""Even if you love her, even if you want to marry her... I gave up everything for you—why the hell would you want me dead?""

Adrian's eyes turned dark, filled with pure malice. He leaned in close to her ear, his voice cold and venomous. ""You're such an idiot. If you don't die, how am I supposed to get my hands on the Moore family fortune?""

Isis felt like the world had just come crashing down on her. So, all this time, his pursuit, his proposal, it was all about her family's money.

'How fucking pathetic...' Isis let out a bitter laugh, blood staining her lips. 'I thought this was love... real love...'

Adrian's eyes gleamed with cold fury. ""This is all your fault, Isis. Don't blame anyone else. If you had just handed over the inheritance, we wouldn't be here.""

His voice was devoid of emotion—no affection, no warmth—just pure, heartless calculation.

Layla stood next to him, her arms crossed and a cruel sneer on her face. ""Adrian, stop wasting time with this bitch. Just shove the poison down her throat already—we've got a prenatal checkup to get to.""

Isis's heart slammed in her chest. 'Prenatal checkup? They... they are already having a kid?'

Layla's hand rested smugly on her flat stomach, a look of pure satisfaction in her eyes.

Isis could barely process it—her whole world was falling apart. But there was no time for that now. Adrian grabbed her face and shoved the last dose of poison into her mouth, eyes burning with hatred.

As soon as the poison hit, a wave of pain ripped through her insides. It felt like her organs were being torn apart. The agony was unbearable.

She couldn't speak anymore. Couldn't even move. All she could do was endure, feel her life slipping away, bit by bit.

Regret swallowed her whole. She had given everything for him—sacrificed her family, her dignity, her freedom—and in return, she got... nothing.

It wasn't worth a damn thing.

As darkness overtook her, she closed her eyes. If she ever got another shot at life, she'd never fall for Adrian's lies again.

Then, a flash of white light exploded before her eyes.

And suddenly—BANG! BANG! BANG! Urgent pounding on the door echoed in her ears.

""Isis! Open the door!""

# Chapter 2 Let's Get A Divorce

Isis jolted awake, her heart pounding. 'Wait... didn't I already die?'

But when she opened her eyes, everything around her—the same old wedding bedroom she shared with Adrian—was exactly the way it had been.

She was completely thrown off, wondering if she was still stuck in some kind of dream.

But then, the sound of someone banging on the door snapped her back to reality. ""Isis! Come on, open the door!"" The voice was so sharp and real, it cut through her confusion.

She pinched herself hard, and the sharp sting was all the proof she needed. This wasn't a dream.

Her eyes darted to the clock on the wall, and the date hit her like a ton of bricks. It was the fifth day since she married Adrian.

'Wait... did I just time travel?' The thought smacked her upside the head. She jumped out of bed and rushed to the door.

Standing outside was Adrian's little sister, Alice Anderson, looking pissed as hell. ""What the hell took you so long? I need my tuition money, like, now.""

Isis smirked coldly. Of course, everything was just as she remembered.

It was the fifth day after her marriage to Adrian. It seemed like fate was cutting her some slack. She hadn't gone back before marrying him, but it was better late than never.

This time, she wasn't going to let the Anderson family walk all over her.

Isis looked Alice up and down, her expression hardening. She'd treated Alice like a real sister once, but what had Alice done? Used her like an ATM.

With ice in her voice, Isis shot back, ""Not a chance."" Then, without another word, she slammed the door in Alice's face.

On the other side, Alice was frozen in shock. 'Did I just hear that right? Isis actually said she's not paying my tuition? Has she completely lost it?'

Fuming, Alice stomped downstairs and barged into the living room where her mom, Zoe Anderson, was sipping her coffee like nothing was wrong. ""Mom, Isis won't pay my tuition.""

Zoe let out a scoffing laugh. ""No way. She's always been the one to give in to us. There's no way she's saying no now.""

Alice's confusion was evident. ""I'm telling you, she really said no.""

""Mom, do you think... maybe Isis finally got what she wanted—married my brother—and now she's changed? Was everything she did for us just an act?"" Alice's voice wavered with doubt.

Zoe put her coffee cup down, raising an eyebrow. ""I seriously doubt it. She's been obsessed with your brother from the start.

""Hell, she bought this whole place with her own money and only put your brother's name on the deed. No way she was faking that.""

Alice immediately saw the point. ""So she still dared to pull that crap with me? Hell no! I'm going to give her a piece of my mind!""

Isis had always been the calm, collected type, never one to lose her temper. But the icy, indifferent way she'd acted earlier really threw Alice for a loop. For a moment, Alice forgot to argue altogether.

Zoe quickly intervened. ""Forget it, let's just wait for your brother to get back. He'll know how to handle her—teach Isis a lesson she won't forget.""

Zoe had her own plans. Alice's tuition needed to be paid, not to mention Grandma Naomi Anderson's VIP hospital bills. Zoe couldn't afford to go to war with Isis just yet.

And, to top it all off, the Anderson family's business was at a critical stage. Both William and Adrian Anderson had mentioned needing a huge cash injection, fast.

All of that depended on Isis Moore. Zoe knew that if they were going to get anything from her, it was going to have to be through Adrian.

\*\*\*\*\*

Isis closed the door behind her and sat down, trying to process the whirlwind of events that had just unfolded.

Before everything went sideways, she'd only been married to Adrian for three months when he tried to poison her. But even before that, she'd been slowly poisoned for a while. Maybe even set up in this life.

But she wasn't sweating it. The poison wasn't fatal unless triggered by another substance, and even though she was already poisoned, she wasn't in any real danger.

What mattered now was getting a divorce from Adrian and getting back everything she'd sacrificed for the Anderson family.

Later that night, when Adrian came home and heard about everything, he immediately flew off the handle. ""Isis! What the hell is wrong with you?!""

He kicked open her door. ""Why didn't you pay Alice's tuition?!""

Isis gave him a cold, dead-eyed look, trying to suppress the boiling anger inside. ""Because I don't want to.""

Adrian froze, blinking. 'What? What the hell? Isis, what kind of attitude is that? Has she completely lost it?'

Realizing he still needed money from her, Adrian sneered, ""Look, I'm giving you one chance. Go apologize to Alice, pay her tuition and Grandma's hospital fees, and I'll let it slide.""

Isis couldn't hold back her laughter. She didn't even blink. ""Not happening. I don't need you to let it slide.""

Adrian lost it. He pointed at her, practically spitting with rage. ""Isis! Don't think just because we're married, everything's smooth sailing! You should know, we can always get a divorce!""

Isis just nodded, not missing a beat. ""Fine. Let's get divorced then.""

Adrian's jaw dropped. He stared at her, shocked. There was no way she was serious. She had to be out of her mind.

""You're really crazy,"" he spat, and turned to walk out.

It wasn't that he didn't want the divorce—it was just that the timing wasn't right yet.

Isis laughed bitterly to herself as she watched him leave. What a coward. He couldn't even say the word ""divorce"" himself.

Just then, Sophie Perry, the housekeeper, walked in slowly, her face full of concern. ""Mrs. Anderson, are you alright?""

""I'm fine, Sophie. I'm getting a divorce,"" Isis said flatly, but with a steely resolve.

Sophie blinked, stunned. ""Are you... sure? Did something happen?""

Anyone else might not have understood, but Sophie, who had been with Isis since she was little, knew how deeply Isis had loved Adrian.

Since they'd started dating, Isis had been completely devoted to him. When they decided to get married, Adrian had moved his entire family in, and Isis had treated them like her own, taking care of them without question.

The Anderson family's business had been struggling until Isis stepped in, using her resources to help the company skyrocket.

Once Zoe Anderson moved into the villa and the company took off, she started living like a high-society lady—demanding only the best. She even spent money like it was nothing just to fit in with the elite wives of Sans City.

Alice, on the other hand, had always been about luxury and status. She could've gone to a public school, but insisted on going to an expensive private one. She'd constantly begged Isis for favors.

Because they were family, Isis had agreed. But after that, the Andersons never brought up Alice's tuition again, leaving Isis to foot the bill.

And let's not forget Adrian's grandma Naomi Anderson, who practically lived in the VIP ward of the hospital. Isis was the one paying for her treatment, while the Andersons couldn't care less.

Isis had given so much for Adrian. They'd finally gotten married. But now, just five days into the marriage, she was already talking about divorce.

Sophie couldn't believe it.

A bitter, self-mocking smile spread across Isis's face as she looked up at Sophie. Her eyes were hard with determination. ""Sophie, I've made up my mind. I'm divorcing him.""

Sophie was the housekeeper who'd raised Isis like a daughter. So after Isis was killed by the Andersons in her past life, Sophie wasn't having it.

She threw a fit, demanding they do an autopsy to prove the truth, but the Andersons just sold her out—shipped her off to some remote, godforsaken mountain where she was tortured for god knows how long until it broke her and drove her insane.

Just thinking about it made Isis's eyes sting with tears. Because of her own damn mistakes, Sophie had to suffer too. This time around, she swore she would protect Sophie—no matter what.

# Chapter 3 Why Should I Cook?

When the Anderson family found out that Adrian hadn't just failed to patch things up with Isis but had come back empty-handed—and, to make matters worse, she'd actually asked for a divorce—everyone was completely stunned.

Zoe rushed over to her son. ""No way you can divorce her, Adrian! We haven't even gotten all the perks from the Moore family yet! Don't be a fool.""

William nodded, agreeing with his wife. ""Exactly. Our company's barely scraping by. We've got to keep Isis in check. No two ways about it.""

Adrian, already frustrated beyond belief, muttered, ""She actually asked for a divorce? If I go along with that, I'll look like a complete idiot. Does she seriously think I can't live without her?""

Truth was, he had never really been all that into her.

If Layla hadn't gone abroad when she did, leaving him heartbroken, he wouldn't have given Isis a second thought. But Isis came into his life, cared for him in ways no one else did, and he ended up marrying her.

But later Layla was back in town, just when he was about to tie the knot with Isis, it felt like everything was a mess. He regretted how things had played out.

There had been moments when he seriously thought about asking for a divorce. But the perks Isis brought to the table—they were way too important to throw away.

His whole family was dead set against him ending things, and he couldn't afford to risk that.

At least, not yet.

So he buried his feelings for Layla deep down and decided to stick with Isis.

'But now, after all that, for Isis to pull this crap right after we got married? What the hell?' Adrian thought. He stormed out of the room, seething with anger.

William and Zoe exchanged looks as they watched him leave, both of them sighing heavily. ""He's off again! And we still haven't even gotten the damn tuition money!""

William let out a long sigh. ""Tuition's peanuts. That's just 100 thousand dollars. The real problem is Mom's hospital bills—one million at least.""

Zoe, shaking her head in frustration, pointed at Adrian's retreating back. ""How the hell does he not know how to handle Isis? He had her eating out of his hand before. But now? Ever since Layla came back, it's like he's completely lost it!

""Bet he's off to chase after that little temptress Layla again.""

Zoe was beyond furious now, and her thoughts were a whirlwind of anger. 'What the hell does Layla have that my son can't get over? He was seriously losing her mind.'

William furrowed his brow, clearly worried. ""At this rate, sooner or later, Isis's gonna figure it out. I heard from Adrian that they've been married for five days, and they haven't even slept together. Don't you think she's gonna start asking questions?""

Zoe was boiling with anger. 'Ugh, this stupid son of mine—why the hell does he always chicken out when it's time to take action?'

She asked, ""What the hell do we do now?""

William let out a heavy sigh, frustration written all over his face. He knew that if Isis figured things out, they were totally screwed. He had seen firsthand everything she'd done for them over the past couple of years.

With her money and connections, she had turned their failing business into one of the top companies in Sans City. Their assets had skyrocketed, growing by a hundred times.

If Adrian hadn't been so obsessed with marrying Layla, they wouldn't even be considering letting go of Isis. She was their cash cow.

Adrian stepped out the door and ran straight into Layla, who was holding a gift.

""Adrian? You heading out?"" Layla asked, a little surprised.

The second Adrian saw her, all his anger seemed to evaporate. He softened, flashing a smile that was completely different from the one he had when dealing with Isis. ""Layla, what's up? What are you doing here?""

Layla, looking sweet and graceful in a white dress, raised the gift with a smile. ""I heard Zoe likes the pastries from this place, so I thought I'd bring some over.""

Adrian's heart immediately softened. ""Layla, you're too good to them.""

Layla blushed, her smile warm. ""Adrian, your family's my family. I should be doing nice things for them.""

Adrian looked around and realized they were still standing outside. Fighting the urge to pull her into his arms, he said, ""Come on, let's go inside. You staying for dinner?""

Layla smiled brightly, following him in like the perfect little wife.

As they walked through the luxurious villa, a dark flicker crossed her eyes. 'Just wait, I'll be the one running this place soon.'

Inside, Zoe and William exchanged a look as Adrian returned with Layla trailing behind him. They weren't sure how to react. They hadn't even managed to fix things with Isis yet, and now Adrian had brought Layla home.

When Zoe realized that Layla had come all the way to bring her gifts, her face softened, and she broke into a warm smile, inviting Layla to sit down.

After all, this wasn't the first time Layla had joined them at the table.

After coming back from studying abroad, Layla had joined the hospital where Adrian worked—and she'd actually climbed the ranks faster than him. Since they'd been classmates, she'd quickly become a regular at the Anderson household.

Adrian didn't exactly have a high-profile job at the hospital. He mostly went there because of his medical background, but also to help the Anderson family expand their business.

The Andersons were deep in healthcare, so having connections in the hospital was key for the company's success.

As Zoe casually suggested that Layla stay for dinner, she asked, ""Where's Isis? Go tell her to come down and help with dinner!""

At the mention of Isis, Adrian's face immediately darkened. He remembered how she'd acted earlier, and he muttered, clearly pissed off, ""I'm not asking her.""

Zoe, clearly frustrated, had no choice but to head upstairs herself. When she found Isis, her tone was uncharacteristically sweet. ""Isis, Adrian's colleague Layla is here. Could you please make a few extra dishes for dinner tonight?""

Isis normally handled all the cooking, even though they had a housekeeper who could cook. But every meal was meticulously planned and prepared by her.

As soon as Isis heard that Layla was coming over, her eyes narrowed with a cold, hard edge.

In her past life, Layla had been a regular guest at their house, always claiming to be Adrian's colleague and classmate. Isis had trusted her completely, even going out of her way to make Layla's favorite dishes every time.

Little did she know, she'd been unwittingly playing hostess to Adrian's mistress.

'I can't believe how fucking blind I was back then,' she thought bitterly.

When Isis didn't respond, Zoe's patience snapped. ""Did you hear me? Why the hell are you just standing there?""

Isis snapped back to reality and, seeing Zoe's disgusted expression, shot back coldly, ""I'm not going.""

Zoe froze. ""What did you just say?""

Isis's voice was like ice. ""I said, I'm not going. We've got a housekeeper, don't we? Why the hell should I cook?""

Zoe stood there, completely stunned. 'Is she out of her damn mind?'

# Chapter 4 Stream Cut

When Zoe heard Adrian mention that Isis was thinking about divorcing him, her instincts kicked in immediately.

She could tell by Isis's face that this wasn't some emotional outburst—it had to be something serious that pushed her to this point.

'But a divorce right now? That's not the smartest move...' Zoe thought to herself, surprisingly calm.

Instead of arguing with Isis, she just turned and walked off. 'It's just a meal, right? I don't even need to lift a finger, and I'll still make her pay.'

Back at the hall, Zoe didn't waste any time cooking. Instead, she ordered a ridiculously expensive meal from Sans City's top Regal Hotel. Foie gras, lobster, rib-eye steak, caviar—the whole nine yards.

She wasn't a VIP, so she couldn't just get delivery, but Zoe knew how to work her connections, and a call to Hannah White in her circle had it all arranged.

I had never felt close to god at all, fairly solidly atheist and suffered from lifelong depression.
Thirty years ago, long before treatment, I chose to end my life the following day and determined how. That night while I slept I saw the Devine and had my pain removed. I woke up and called a friend who took my to a diner and drank coffee with me until dawn. 
After ten years of therapy and medication I came to the simple realization that I didn’t love or even like myself. I was loved by others, wonderful family, an unexpectedly successful career and respect from peers, but I could never shake it. 
Once I realized that I had such disdain for myself my first thought was that there was the light within me and that realization was profound. 
After a few years I have gotten up the courage to go to a meeting, people have been welcoming, as one would expect of friends. 
But I remain somewhat alienated by the majority of what people choose to share: maybe 50% in the three months I have attended have been about Palestine. 
I’m against people being killed, mistreated and the like. 
But I am somewhat surprised how little of people’s shared thoughts are of the internal, the joy, the struggle, the experience of feeling the Devine. 
Is this my meeting or is this normal? I don’t expect people to have lived my life, I have felt like an outsider in every aspect of my life. But I was hoping for more fellowship in what is personal, rather than political. ",1,1745654309.0,Quakers,0,1.0,False
1k87sf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1k87sf6/struggling_with_possible_adhd_loneliness_feeling/,"Struggling with possible ADHD, loneliness, feeling like a loser.","Hey Reddit, I need to get this off my chest. I think I have ADD or maybe ADHD. When I was younger, I thought it was just ADD because my brother had ADHD—he was super hyper, legs always moving, and easily aggravated. I’m grown now, and I’m leaning toward ADHD. I struggle with focus, my legs are always restless now, and I get distracted so easily. I completely  avoid coffee and caffeine, but it doesn’t help.

I’m not working right now, and job hunting online is overwhelming. It’s hard to stay motivated, and I get really depressed and lonely. I don’t have a wife, girlfriend, or kids—and honestly, I don’t want kids. The world feels too expensive and tough, and I don’t want them growing up struggling like me. But being alone is rough. Last night was Friday, and I tried going out to meet people, but I felt so out of place.

I’m over 30, and life feels bleak. I don’t have a diploma—school was brutal, and I’m pretty sure I’m dyslexic. Math and writing are not my strengths. I own a car but rent my place, and money’s tight. I don’t have much to offer in a relationship, which makes me feel like a loser. I don’t have hobbies, and I don’t hang out with many friends. My siblings live in other states, and we’re too different to connect deeply. I do have friends and family who care, but I still feel like everyone’s just trying to get by, overindulging or passing time however we can.

I’ve got self-destructive tendencies because of the depression. (I don't drink or do drugs) But sometimes I just want to, out of boredom or depression, but don't.  Oftentimes, I think about ending it. I don’t have a clear career path or many skills, and I don’t know what I want to do. I feel like women want stability—someone over 6ft, body built, with money, a house, a nice car—and I’m none of that. I'm not ugly or over weight but I feel ugly most times. 
I spiral into dark thoughts and want to end it.

I've also completely switched from coffee to tea, as coffee is too rich for me now.

The one healthy snack that seems to hit the spot for me is fermented slaws from a local artisanal fermentation business. They make all kinds of slaws and kimchi that are tasty, vinegary and light, with the added benefits of being made of vegetables (and sometimes a bit of fruit) and being fermented (and not pasteurised as the store bought slaws would be), which give gut health benefits.

So if you're like me and still find yourself aimlessly looking for a satisfying snack, I highly recommend seeking a local fermentation company and seeing if they do deliveries. I get a monthly delivery of 3 seasonal slaws which is perfect.

1k87nfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k87nfh/for_shelbob_my_high_school_ex_m28/,For Shelbob; my high school ex (M28),"Lately, my heart feels heavier than usual. This has been weighing on me for a year now.

When I was 13, I was diagnosed with a brain AVM, which led to seizures and a minor stroke. I was pulled out of school and placed in home education because I was terrified of having a seizure in public—of being seen as a freak, of being laughed at. It was a near-death experience, and it changed everything. I went through physical therapy all the way through high school just to regain some sense of normalcy in my left side. The fear never left. The anxiety from it often triggered more seizures, and I felt like no one was really there for me.

I only had one real relationship before all of this—a childhood girlfriend I’d been with for years. We eventually went our separate ways at 16, like first loves often do. That break pushed me to be more social, to try and open up. That’s when I met a girl named “Shelbob.”

She’d just moved from Ohio to Florida and was a bit of an outsider too. We connected over games, anime, and a shared sense of brokenness. She had her own medical struggles—breathing problems and the effects of medication that caused weight gain—but I never cared about any of that. To me, it was always about someone’s soul. And with her, I felt seen, despite everything.

She made an effort—enrolled in my classes, wanted to spend time with me. Eventually, she wanted to take the next step in our relationship—to lose our virginity to each other. I wanted to, truly. But just before we would start, I’d panic. I was terrified—not of her, but of what my body might do. What if I had a seizure during something so intimate? What if I ruined everything in the worst way? She didn’t understand, and she got frustrated.

Years passed. My AVM was eventually deemed no longer a risk, and I finally found the courage to share that first experience with someone else—before New Year’s”

Then came the betrayal.

She cheated on me in her hometown, in a McDonald's parking lot, with a guy who, of all things, shared my name. It was confirmed by mutual friends—on Christmas, no less. Then she spread lies about me, turning the small circle of acquaintances. She tried to justify it later, saying she felt neglected and that it happened in the heat of the moment. She asked me to forgive her and said things would be different.

I couldn’t.

She kept reaching out—birthday messages, gifts, spamming GTA invites, trying to show she still cared. Part of me wanted to forgive her. But around that time, my dad was arrested and could be facing five years, and I found out my childhood girlfriend had developed cancer... and passed away.

I didn’t want to drag Shelbob into that grief. I didn’t want to rebuild something broken when I was mentally shattered. So we moved on and dated other people.

Fast forward to 2020. COVID hit. Everyone was isolated and online. I got on Tinder one night and saw her again. She claimed she was on Ambien, swiping without thinking. But we started talking again—slowly at first, then fully catching up. She told me about her plans to move to Colorado (Later Tampa, FL) with a guy friend she was considering living with. I had my dreams, looking into Boston as a Digital Marketer and advancing my Photography career.

Then came the truth—she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. But the way she described this “guy friend,” it was clear there was more going on. Still, she wanted to meet for coffee.

I put my resentment aside for that moment. I knew deep down this would be the last time I’d ever see her. We talked for two hours. I didn’t get into the heavy things—I didn’t see the point. I knew she’d already chosen her path.

The last thing I said to her was:  
**“I forgive you, but I can’t forget what you did.”**

We left. We never spoke again.

Today, “Shelbob” is married to that same guy, and they’ve just celebrated the birth of their first child.

I’m in a two-year relationship with someone truly wonderful. I lost over 140 pounds and am now sitting at the healthiest place in my life. We’re even starting to talk about marriage. She’s the one who encouraged me to write all of this out.

If by some chance you ever come across this, Shelbob—this is for you.

It’s strange, but despite everything you did, I still care about you. It might be silly, but it’s true.  
Even though the door between us is permanently closed, I’m genuinely glad you found happiness.  
Our story was a tragic one, but there were beautiful, humble memories I’ll never forget:  
The Universal trip with your parents (me losing your mother's glasses).  
Homecoming.  
Gaming sessions that stretched into the night.

Eventually, those memories will fade into the distance, like all things do. When we met at that coffee shop, I couldn’t tell you everything I was going through. I knew nothing I said would change the outcome. You had already made your decision. And I… I didn’t know how to speak my truth without falling apart. Why say more when I can cause more damage or tell you more about a person you're trying to forget? So I held it in, like I always have. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about my father, the dead ex or being what you wanted.

And because of that, we failed each other.

I thought about messaging you again after I heard about the baby—on PlayStation, maybe, or through social media. But I figured the last person you'd want to hear from is me.

So this is me, quietly stepping out of your orbit, and by chance you're in my orbit. I hope this finds you.

I wish you nothing but the best in motherhood.",2,1745653663.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

They were fuzzy and soft on my feet. They were fake fleece. There was no back, so it was easy to slide my feet into them. The sole was felt. They were silent on my hardwood floors. I could get up and shuffle into the kitchen without disturbing anyone. I could slide around in them, which was great for dancing at home by myself. When they got dirty, I could throw them in the washing machine.

When I look for slippers, they often have soles that are made for going outside or that are anti-slip.

I want all the slip. I know how good slip can be.

I don’t want to take them outside. They will never know weather. I want the sole to be soft and silent. Is the sole absorbent? Good. They can help me dry the floor after I mop.

I don’t want a back. I don’t want a sock. I want to be able to take them on and off while holding a full mug of coffee and a plate of food. I want hands-free operation so I can kick them off without breaking a snuggle. They should be soft and fuzzy. I also love my oofos but I hate how they feel on my bare feet, especially on hot days when they feel sticky, or on cold mornings. When I’m going between my bed and slippers, I don’t want a detour to my sock drawer.

1k87kwm,https://i.redd.it/8d8tgcsnv4xe1.jpeg,Best platforms for finding freelance motion design gigs in 2025?,"
1. The Gig Economy: Where Dreams and Deadlines Collide

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the world of freelance motion design in 2025 — where your client thinks ""Can you animate this logo?"" means “Make Pixar jealous by Friday.”

Being a freelancer today means living between After Effects, Blender, and the crushing fear of not getting paid on time. But hey — at least we have platforms to help us find gigs... and existential dread.


---

2. Upwork: AKA, “The Hunger Games – Design Edition”

Ah, Upwork. The platform where you submit your reel and résumé just to get ghosted harder than your Tinder date from last Tuesday.

You’re competing with people charging $5 for a full 3D animated explainer with sound design, voice-over, and moral support.

But if you’re patient, craft killer proposals, and develop the patience of a Buddhist monk on a Wi-Fi diet — you can land solid, high-paying gigs.


---

3. Fiverr: Where You’re a “Gigster,” Not Just a Human Being

Fiverr has come a long way. It used to be “everything for $5,” now it’s “everything for $5 and a mild mental breakdown.”

But the Fiverr Pro section is actually a golden land where motion designers can charge premium rates… as long as you can survive Fiverr’s audition process, which is only slightly less rigorous than applying for The Avengers.


---

4. Behance + Adobe Portfolio: Where Clients Lurk Like Ninjas

Your Behance page isn’t just for showing off your passion projects anymore. In 2025, creative directors scroll through Behance like they’re on Netflix looking for something good to watch.

“Hmm… That loopable coffee commercial? Add to favorites. That kinetic typography video about taxes? Bold choice.”

Keep it updated. Add mockups. Pretend your reel is the trailer for your Emmy.


---

5. Contra & Polywork: The New Kids Who Brought Snacks

If LinkedIn and Instagram had a baby, and that baby was a freelancer who drinks cold brew and reads Medium articles — that baby would be Contra.
It's sleek, curated, and doesn’t make you feel like you're begging.

Polywork, meanwhile, lets you show all your titles at once. “I’m a motion designer / UI animator / Meme historian.” Finally, the respect we deserve.


---

6. LinkedIn: The Corporate Clubhouse with Cool Clients

Yes, yes — LinkedIn. Where you pretend to be professional while secretly hoping someone hires you for your dancing hot dog animation.

But seriously, LinkedIn is fire in 2025. With the rise of content-based outreach and client scouting, if you're posting WIPs, behind-the-scenes, and spicy breakdowns, you're basically fishing with dynamite.


---

7. The Real Secret Sauce: Your Network (Yes, Even the Guy Who Sold You Fonts)

Don’t underestimate the power of DMs, referrals, and “Hey, I remember you from that Discord where we both complained about clients asking for vertical 3D.”

Your old classmates, old bosses, even your cousin who once asked if “GIFs are illegal” — they might just bring your next gig.


---

Final Thoughts: Survive the Algorithm, Win the Client

So what’s the real best platform for freelance motion design gigs in 2025?
All of them. And also none of them.

Because the best gigs still come from showing up, sharing your work, building relationships, and remembering that you’re not just a motion designer…

You’re a story shaper. A vibe crafter. A pixel whisperer with insomnia.

Now go out there, update your portfolio, and slay some timelines.

I first tasted each black and then with a bit of half and half to cut back on the bitter taste. 

**Brewing**

Pistachio Vanilla (VL) – Can smell vanilla with a bit of nuttiness. More vanilla than pistachio.

Almond Croissant (VL) – I can smell more almond. Very similar to Pistachio Vanilla.

Tropical Coconut (VL) – much coconut. Tastes like lounging on the beach.

Coconut Vanilla (VL) – Smells like Pistachio Vanilla to me. It has the same vanilla scent. Almost overpowering, like the Vanilla in PV.

The OL flavors smell like their VL counterparts, just a lot more concentrated.

**Tasting**  
**Black**

Pistachio Vanilla – ew. Bitter and not really Pistachio flavored. Vanilla > Pistachio.

Almond Croissant – Better. Tastes almost exactly like PV, just less bitter and more palatable.

Coconut Vanilla – better than PV. More Coconut w/ aftertaste of Vanilla. Tastes like laying on the beach, sipping a refreshing coffee, and eyeing up my husband. Sorry, but this woman got married last month and this made me appreciate the beach a lot more.

Tropical Coconut – Tastes like CV without the vanilla aftertaste.

Coconut Vanilla OL – More concentrated than it’s counterpart. I can taste a lot more of the vanilla.

Pistachio Vanilla OL - \*sick face\* Even more bitter than the VL as expected. Vanilla with a side of nuts. 

**Half & Half**

Pistachio Vanilla – calmed the bitterness. Still more vanilla than pistachio. Tastes like Almond Croissant.

Almond Croissant – Better than PV, but tastes almost the same.

Coconut Vanilla – Better than last year. Aftertaste of vanilla.

Tropical Coconut – Same but without the aftertaste. I like Coconut Vanilla more.

Coconut Vanilla OL – Same.

Pistachio Vanilla OL – nuts + vanilla. Tastes more like Coconut Vanilla to me.

**Tl;dr** Pistachio Vanilla smells and tastes very similar to Almond Croissant. More Vanilla than nut taste. Definitely not what I was expecting with 'Pistachio'. The OL Pistachio Vanilla tastes a bit like the Coconut Vanilla to me.VL Coconut Vanilla is definitely better than the previous years.",1,1745653197.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1k87gqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1k87gqq/meeting_my_dads_fiancee/,meeting my dad’s fiancee.,"I’m no contact with my dad. He’s engaged. He’s getting married to a woman. I have never met her in my life. I have thought about this over and over again. Nobody in my family wants to warn her. They just want to “sit back and watch the roller coaster.” and my mom said that maybe if he’s entertained with her, he won’t come after her and start verbally abusing her. And I know if he catches wind that I talked to his fiancee, and if she made any kind of decision based on what i tell her, he may start verbally abusing me. 

But I’ve decided I cannot live with myself if I don’t say something to this woman. It’s likely she’s already experienced something that makes her hesitant to marry him. God, I really don’t want her to marry him. I hope she doesn’t marry him. I couldn’t live with myself if i let it happen to this woman. Somebody told me, “you don’t know who she is. she could be no-contact with her own children. she could be equally bad.” but I don’t think I can assume she deserves it as much as i can’t assume she doesn’t deserve it. This woman is very beautiful and she has a sweet smile in her pictures and she’s a college professor, just like my dad. I cannot let a sweet and smart looking woman go through marrying my father. if she decides to ignore me, so be it. ill know i’ve done what i can. My dad doesn’t provide me with anything. I can deal with some mean words. 

I just know I’ll have to be smart about it. I was the family “scapegoat”. my other siblings were very compliant. they “fawned” and i “fought”. they are both still in contact with him. they haven’t said anything to her. they’ve met her. they said she seems nice. 

i’m not trying to be a hero i guess. whatever she wants to do she can do. but if she went through with it and nobody told her and they were unhappy and broke up and she went through what my mom did, i’d be so unhappy with myself. i’d regret it. that man ruined my mom. she is damaged by him. very damaged. 

i know i’ll have to be smart about it. I have to feel it out. i can’t just go see her and start trauma dumping about my dad. i sent her a text asking if she’d like to meet me for coffee, because i’d like to meet her and talk with her. nothing more than that. i don’t want her to be angry with me, or think i am trying to use her to spite my dad, or anything like that. i want to be myself and be honest and hope she believes me. 

my dad is a narcissistic, sex obsessed pedophile and emotionally, he didn’t age a day since his dad died when he was 6. he’s a sick, sick man and i would not wish the curse of loving him on my worst enemy. i need advice for how to go about this. but please don’t ask me not to do it. you can’t change my mind.

I wasn’t trying to quit smoking or anything noble like that. I just liked the idea of blowing big clouds and maybe not stinking like an ashtray.

It was behind the counter in a glass case, sitting alone like a misfit. Matte black, fat as a roll of quarters, no brand name, just a little sticker on the side of a skull with a third eye.

“That one?” the cashier asked, pausing as he rang me up. He looked like he hadn’t slept since the Obama administration. His eyes were red, twitchy. “You sure you want that?”

I shrugged. “Why? Battery explode or something?”

He opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else, then closed it and scanned the barcode. “You’ll see,” he muttered, almost too quiet to hear.

First hit was insane. Smooth, cold, minty but sweet too. Not like fruit or candy. More like blood in your mouth when you bite your cheek. Familiar and wrong. I held the vapor for a second, then exhaled a thick cloud that hung in the air longer than it should have, swirling in weird patterns.

For a second, the gas station lights flickered harder, and the radio, some crappy country song, slowed down, like the DJ dropped the record in molasses. I laughed nervously but shook it off. Maybe I was more tired than I thought.

By the time I got home, my chest ached. Not in my lungs though, deeper, like something buzzing behind my sternum, trying to dig its way out. I told myself it was just anxiety or maybe that gas station chicken sandwich turning on me.

I sat on the couch and took another drag. Bigger this time. I Let it sit in my lungs until my vision fuzzed around the edges. That’s when I saw him.

The hallway light was off, but the shape at the end was solid. A man. Too tall. Too still. My brain tried to tell me it was just a coat rack or a shadow, but I knew better. He didn’t move like a shadow. He twitched, glitching forward in little bursts like someone tapping pause and play on a VHS tape.

His face wasn’t right. Too many teeth in the wrong places. No eyes, just two deep, dark bruises, like the sockets were hollowed out and filled with something wet. He was watching me. I felt it like static crawling up my spine.

I dropped the vape. It hit the coffee table and kept hissing, releasing thin curls of vapor that spread across the floor like fog in a bad dream.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t speak. I just ran. Ran and grabbed my keys while bolting out the door barefoot. I slept in my car that night, parked two blocks away, doors locked, hoodie pulled tight. 

The next morning, everything looked normal. Apartment untouched. Hallway empty, but the air felt wrong. Heavy, like walking through someone else’s nightmare.

I haven’t hit the vape since. Haven’t even touched it. But I didn’t throw it away, either. It’s still on my coffee table. Right where I left it. Sometimes, in the dead middle of the night, I’ll catch that sweet, minty scent floating from the living room, even though the vape hasn’t been charged in weeks.

And sometimes I’ll wake up with my chest buzzing again, deeper now, like something small and patient has moved in.

I know I should get rid of it. Burn it, smash it, bury it. But sometimes, against all reason, I just want one more drag.

Just one.

""Just sign them. It's for show—to pacify the girl.""  
  
I was stunned for a moment, then silently signed my name.  
  
As I was leaving, I overheard his friend teasing him：  
  
""Damn, your wife is so obedient! You asked her to get the divorce certificate and she didn't say a word, did she?""  
  
They bet that in three months' time at the Court, I would cry like a dog but still obediently accept a divorce certificate.  
  
I didn't say anything, just replied to the message I just received:  
  
\[Will you marry me instead?\]  
  
""Alright.""  
  
\[?\]  
  
The reply came almost instantly.  
  
Inside, more laughter erupted.  
  
I hurried out, feeling panicked.  
  
It wasn't until I was outside the office building that tears finally streamed down my cheeks.  
  
——  
  
Ryan had fallen for a young girl who hadn't even graduated yet.  
  
He bought her a condo in Bay City and filled it with luxury items.  
  
But she wouldn't let him kiss her or hold her.  
  
She lived in a 3,600-square-foot penthouse, wore custom designer clothes worth hundreds of thousands, yet stubbornly insisted: ""I REFUSE TO BE A MISTRESS!""  
  
Ryan found this utterly fascinating.  
  
This was already the third time Ryan had put on a show for her.  
  
The first time, he and I displayed affection publicly.  
  
I didn't know about Lily's existence then.  
  
I happily took many photos with him, arms intimately wrapped around each other.  
  
When I saw him post a grid of nine photos, I was surprised and excited.  
  
But what I never expect was that post no matter how much I scrolled.  
  
Later I discovered he'd set it to ""Only Lily can see."" Heh…  
  
The second time, he fought with me and left me on the street.  
  
Then took photos of me crying alone and sent them to Lily.  
  
\[See? What can I do? She can't live without me.\]  
  
This time, he wanted to divorce me. Okay, whatever.  
  
My phone vibrated repeatedly. I took it out.  
  
\[Really?\]  
  
\[You're serious?\]  
  
\[Sophie?\]  
  
I wiped away my tears and smiled faintly.  
  
""Really.""  
  
That afternoon, Ryan indeed took me to the Court.  
  
He was in a great mood the entire way.  
  
He kept asking where I wanted to go for our third anniversary.  
  
Ryan and I had grown up together. And this was our third year of marriage.  
  
""How about Prague?"" he suggested.  
  
""You've been talking about feeding pigeons in Prague Square since you were seven.""  
  
He got out of the car, opened my door, and unbuckled my seatbelt.  
  
""Tsk, have you been crying?""  
  
He frowned, his thumb brushing the corner of my eye.  
  
""I told you it's just for show. She's just a little bird—I'm curious when she'll finally give in.""  
  
As he spoke, something fell from his pocket.  
  
A BOX OF CONDOMS.  
  
Ryan cleared his throat, touched his nose.  
  
Explaining nothing, he just led me into the Court.  
  
Everything went smoothly.  
  
I have selective mutism and often can't speak when facing strangers.  
  
But I can nod or shake my head.  
  
""Is this divorce voluntary?"" they asked.  
  
""Yes."" I nodded.  
  
""Do you confirm your relationship has broken down?""  
  
""Yes."" I nodded.  
  
""There's a three-month cooling-off period. Return in three months.""  
  
Ryan took the receipt.  
  
Before we even left the office, he took a photo and sent a message.  
  
Then my phone buzzed with a notification—just like before, it was Lily's.  
  
Ryan had sent her the photo of our receipt with a message:  
  
""Satisfied now? Be clean and ready for me tonight!""  
  
I clicked on her profile and blocked her.  
  
Just after that, I received a flight confirmation text.  
  
At the same time, a Facebook message arrived:  
  
\[Tickets booked. Three months from now.\]  
  
\[See you in Paris.\]  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I still dreamed about Ryan that night.  
  
When we were young, Ryan was so sweet.  
  
""Sophie, your eyes are so beautiful. Can I look at them while I talk to you more often?""  
  
""Sophie, your piano playing sounds amazing. Can I come listen to your performances every day?""  
  
""Sophie, I like you best! When we grow up, I want to marry you!""  
  
I liked Ryan too.  
  
We sat together in school and played together after classes.  
  
Even when my parents had their car accident, I was in his family's car—playing rock-paper-scissors with him.  
  
But the cars were too close—I watched that truck cross over.  
  
BOOM------  
  
My father, my mother, my brother, even my little dog I'd raised since it was a puppy—all struggling in a sea of flames.  
  
For a long time after, I couldn't make a sound.  
  
I needed Ryan beside me to fall asleep.  
  
Back then, Ryan was very patient.  
  
He practiced speech exercises with me.  
  
Told me stories night after night.  
  
If anyone dared mock me as ""mute"", then his fist would fly.  
  
Marrying him seemed the most natural thing in the world.  
  
The day after getting our college degrees, he leaned over my bed early in the morning:  
  
""Sophie, let's get another certificate today.""  
  
That day, we became husband and wife.  
  
In my dream, a sea of red roses covered our new home.  
  
He knelt on the bed, kissing me tenderly.  
  
He said, ""Sophie, we'll be this happy forever.""  
  
But…when I opened my eyes, everything was BLACK.  
  
I checked my phone. Lily had sent another message.  
  
A photo—a rumpled bed with a crimson stain.  
  
Ugh—I suddenly felt sick and then rushed to the bathroom and retched.  
  
But all that came out were physiological tears.  
  
In the end, I sat on the cold floor, hugging my knees.  
  
Somehow I must have hit something on my phone, because in the silent night, a deep male voice suddenly sounded:  
  
""Sophie?""  
  
My heart skipped a beat.  
  
I picked up the phone.  
  
""Ethan... Reed?""  
  
Ethan was my support group partner.  
  
After three years of hospital intervention, my selective mutism improved greatly.  
  
I only struggled to speak when emotionally distressed or nervous.  
  
During my first two years of marriage with Ryan, I had almost fully recovered.  
  
I was happy and had free time.  
  
I joined a support group for people with similar conditions.  
  
My assigned partner was Ethan Reed.  
  
For two whole years, I actually thought he was a girl.  
  
Pink bunny profile picture, username ""Angel.""  
  
At first, ""she"" barely responded to me.  
  
But those with similar struggles understand each other.  
  
People with long-term selective mutism often have serious psychological trauma.  
  
They might not speak, but they need company.  
  
I persistently shared my daily life with ""her.""  
  
From text messages to voice messages.  
  
From photos to videos.  
  
Eventually, we became like old friends.  
  
So when I first had a phone call with ""she"" and discovered ""she"" was actually male, I was so shocked I nearly relapsed.  
  
""Uh… I'm... sorry,"" I stammered into the phone. ""I disturbed... your rest...""  
  
""Not at all,"" Ethan said. ""It's nine PM here.""  
  
He spoke so fluently now.  
  
This was only our second call.  
  
After discovering he was male, I deliberately kept my distance.  
  
That day was pure coincidence.  
  
I hadn't contacted him for almost a month.  
  
By such strange timing, he messaged when Ryan handed me the divorce papers, asking what I was doing.  
  
My mind went blank at the words ""DIVORCE PAPERS.""  
  
I only replied: \[Getting divorced.\]  
  
After signing, I hid outside Ryan's office, trembling all over.  
  
\[Ethan, I think… I'm about to lose my home.\]  
  
No father, no mother, no brother, not even my beloved little dog.  
  
And now, no Ryan either.  
  
What would I do?  
  
I never expected his sudden response:  
  
\[Then marry me instead, okay?\]  
  
The teasing inside grew louder.  
  
""Come on, Sophie won't really divorce Ryan. She can't even speak around strangers.""  
  
""Yeah, if she actually went through with it, she'd probably cry so hard the Court would collapse!""  
  
""Really?"" Ryan snorted derisively.  
  
He tossed his lighter onto the coffee table. ""Even if she cries like a dog, she'll still be my dog.""  
  
""If I tell her to go east, she'll crawl east!""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I stared numbly through the door crack at this now-stranger of a man.  
  
\[Alright.\]  
  
Ethan made me a checklist—Things to do within three months.  
  
Getting visas and finding a lawyer were obvious necessities.  
  
But he'd also included a dense list of must-visit restaurants.  
  
\[Brooklyn-Style Pizza here isn't good.\]  
  
\[Trust me.\]  
  
I happily accepted.  
  
Following his list, I ate at one restaurant after another.  
  
Life alone wasn't so terrible after all.  
  
Every day I ate, shopped, and packed my luggage.  
  
The day I moved out of our marital home, Ryan suddenly texted me.  
  
\[Not even calling me? Don't you miss me?\]  
  
He'd taken Lily on vacation.  
  
Said he wanted to show the girl the world.  
  
\[You're such a bad girl!\]  
  
Then a photo.  
  
\[This place is nice. For our anniversary, should I bring you here too?\]  
  
I wanted to block him like I'd blocked Lily.  
  
But considering we still needed to get the divorce certificate, I held back.  
  
For the next two weeks, I dealt with my smaller jewelry pieces and handbags.  
  
Went to the hospital for a checkup to confirm I wasn't pregnant.  
  
Finally, I organized all the assets Ryan had entrusted to me over the years.  
  
The night before returning to the Court, Ryan came back from his trip.  
  
He called me.  
  
""Sophie? You moved out?""  
  
……  
  
Used to my silence on the phone, he laughed to himself.  
  
""Sophie, you're too cute.""  
  
""I told you it was just an act.""  
  
""Well,"" he sounded cheerful, ""let's go all the way with this act. Come with me to the Court tomorrow and get the divorce certificate?""  
  
I gripped my phone.  
  
""Sophie, don't worry, it's just—""  
  
""Fine,"" I said.  
  
""Whoa\~""  
  
A chorus of hooting erupted in the background.  
  
I hung up.  
  
Sent him the time by text.  
  
The next day, I woke up early.  
  
Ryan arrived fashionably late.  
  
He had a faint but visible bite mark on his lip—It must have been Lily's deliberate touch.  
  
He pretended not to notice.  
  
Same here.  
  
The procedure was even smoother than last time—just five minutes.  
  
""Sophie, I've got a surprise for you tomorrow.""  
  
Ryan gently kicked my leg.  
  
I put away the divorce certificate.  
  
""Ryan, are you free tonight?""  
  
Then looked at him. ""There are some things I want to discuss.""  
  
Ryan froze momentarily.  
  
Since our marriage, I'd always called him ""honey.""  
  
The next instant, he curved those almond-shaped eyes into a smile, flicking the booklet in his hand.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
……  
  
No matter what Ryan had become this past year, I didn't want to deny the Ryan of the past.  
  
I was grateful for his many years of companionship and for the care he has given me.  
  
So I never planned to leave without saying goodbye.  
  
But what I never expect was it rained that night with thunder and lightning.  
  
I extremely feared nights like this.  
  
That car accident happened during just such a storm.  
  
I endured the tremors in my body, waiting for Ryan.  
  
I was even worried that when Ryan arrived, years of habit might shatter the psychological barrier I'd built over the past month, and I'd collapse into his arms crying.  
  
But…he never came.  
  
He called instead.  
  
When I answered, the background was noisy.  
  
""What redemption? Bullshit!""  
  
""I was so sick of her for those years! If my mom hadn't forced me, I wouldn't have bothered with her!""  
  
""Marriage? Guess why we married so early?""  
  
""Because she wouldn't let me touch her!""  
  
""I'm just curious—she gets speech problems when she's emotional, right? So what about in bed? Can she make any sounds then? Hahaha\~.""  
  
BOOM------  
  
Something seemed to shatter again on this stormy night, torn to pieces.  
  
I wanted to hide so that no one could see me in such a humiliating state.  
  
But…where could I hide?  
  
Everywhere was rain, everywhere was thunder.  
  
Everywhere was mockery.  
  
That's when Ethan called.  
  
""Sophie?""  
  
His voice was always so calm.  
  
Making all that noise instantly fade away.  
  
""Are you crying?""  
  
I wanted to say no.  
  
But I couldn't make a sound, only tears burst out.  
  
""Wait there,"" he said, still calm. ""I'm coming to get you now.""

Hi i've been a silent reader here for a while just wanted to ask you guys. I've also been dealing with anxiety about my health scare. I know i shouldn't be googling my symptoms and or threading here in reddit but i want clarity. Got an appointment with my gastro on May 1.


A little background about me. I'm 26 Male. Fairly Active and I live in the Philippines and no, my family has no history whatsoever with CA both sides. But we do have a long history of diabetes and hypertension. I have been dealing with my symptoms since April 17and to be fair, before I experienced any of this- I had a unhealthy diet of drinking pure black coffee about 2-3 sachets of it every day since april 1 because i had an upcoming exams. couple that with eating spicy food and a bottle of mountain dew then boom. started to experience it at night which i first thought was appendictis but it wasnt the case since I did the physical exam myself and with the help of my sister who happens to be a nurse.

told my friend who is a doctor about my symptoms and gave me prescription for flanax which didnt help and currently on day 5 of 6 of my probiotics which is kinda a hit or miss. he then ordered me for urinalysis and cbc which were all remarkable and not anemic since I was on the higher end of it all. fast forward to today and still experiencing the following:


•a little blood on my stool which i can feel is due to my hemorrhoids because i have an external one.

• faint lower right abdominal cramping which if didnt pay attention to doesnt bother me at all and i could sleep very well throughout the night

• mid abdomen and upper left abdomen cramp whenever i feel like i need to eat

• bloated and every time i stretch or push my stomach i would always burp

• feel like I had acid reflux which would alleviate my symptoms after every meal

• I can poop once a day but previously it would be 2 or 3 times a day i guess my anxiety has been also the culprit considering prior to me taking probiotics i didnt eat much from overthinking

• my stools are also mushy and been yellowish to green but recently to dark yellow/brown

• not lethargic at all, in fact after my exams, never been more better. 


i'm so sorry for the lengthy post as i've been scared to death since im also entering medschool this year.

I’m trying to separate my living and dining areas in an open-plan space, but I’m running into a bit of a roadblock. Currently, I have an **L-shaped couch** in the middle of the room, hoping it would create a natural divide. However, it doesn’t feel like it's doing enough to clearly define each area. The flow feels off, and I just can't quite make the two spaces feel distinct.

I'm open to **any and all suggestions** — from furniture arrangement ideas, room dividers, or even décor tips that could help make these spaces feel more separate without completely closing them off.

Here’s what I have:

* **Living room area** with the L-shaped couch
* **Dining room area** directly next to it
* A **balcony** that looks out over the living space
* **Stairs** leading up to the upper floor, which also impacts the layout

**Extra note**: I’m also planning to get a **large rug** for the living room and a **coffee table**, but I didn’t include these in my rough floor plan.

If you’ve had success with this, or if you have any creative ideas, please let me know! I’m trying to keep the space open and airy but also functional.

Let's fill up some spots!,"Hello, everyone! As some of you may know, I've been working on a fanmade reboot to Object Terror. I call it ""Object Terror Reloaded""! By now, I have finished the script for the first episode, and want to start working on it as soon as possible. Yet, I can't voice act for the life of me, and I don't want to have to use subtitles for dialouge as that would bore the hell out of the viewers. So, I have decided to accept voice auditions!

Basically, find the character(s) you want to voice act and match their voice qualifications. To apply for a position, DM me stating which character you want to audition for. Send me a [Vocaroo](https://vocaroo.com/) link containing the audio file of your enactment of the example line you are not a controversial or malicious figure, I will take a quick dive into your Reddit account posts. If you pass the background test, and if your audition satisfies my vision, you will be invited into a group chat made for the show's production, where you can chat with other members of the crew!

Here's a list of each character, their voice qualifications, and example lines! In advance, I'd like to say that ""casual voice"" means how you would normally speak . Basically, quirkless. I would also like to say that the voice qualifications do not mean it's the entire character's vocal personality. They should still be able to feel emotion. Anyways, onto the list!

|Character|Character Voice Qualifications|Example Line|Is This Role Taken?|

|Arch|Androgynous-sounding, expressive, somewhat grating voice.|""Great. There's only one person who ever wants to talk to me, and he's a MORON. Why must this always happen to ME?!""|Yes (by u/Ok_Age_1136)|
|Beer|Masculine-sounding, exaggeratively vocal fried, raspy voice.|""Despite your lies, I'll let them slide. I hate Arch anyways. What's the plan?""||
|Biscuit|Androgynous or feminine-sounding (choose one), slightly grating voice.|""Are you saying you LIKE IT when Wallet annoys me?!""||
|Cactus|Masculine-sounding, gravelly, aggressive, stereotypical ""jock"" voice.|""Relax, I'm sure he'll be fine. But try anything else again and neither of you will be...""||
|Carpet|Either masculine or androgynous-sounding (choose one), casual voice.|""Hey, baby. Wassup?""|Yes (by u/TheStalker10101)|

|Flash Drive|Masculine-sounding, relaxed, stereotypical ""hippie""/""stoner"" voice.|""What the heck, brah? If I stayed in there any longer, my circuits would have fried! Not cool, broski.""|Yes (by u/TheStalker10101)|

|ZingZang (replacement for Skittle)|Feminine or androgynous-sounding (choose one), high pitched voice.|""Staplers aren't edible, are they? Now mind your own business.""||

\* Unibrow is a gag character, meaning he only exists for a one-off joke. So, if you chose to voice this character, you must also voice another character too.

If you are wondering why El Nudelo Spider and Plug are exempt from this list, El Nudelo Spider is not a character in this reboot, and Plug is meant to be mute.

Now, here's a list of...

|VOICE ACTOR QUALIFICATIONS|
|:-|


* As the show is aimed at a teenage audience, you must be **13 years of age** or older to audition for the show. As I am a minor who wishes to stay safe on the internet, you **cannot be older than 25** either (by the time you audition). If you do not meet the age requirements, your submission will be rejected automatically.
* When I run the brief background check on your account, I will look for the following to determine whether you are worth hiring:
* \~\~\~ **Traits I look for**:
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Signs of reliability and trustworthiness
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Positive engagement
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Collaborative attitude
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Inclusive and non-discriminatory values
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Experience with voice acting (Optional, but helps your chances a lot)
* \~\~\~ **Traits I would reject you for**:
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Toxic behavior (trolling, discriminatory values, posting offensive content)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Being under/overage
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Over-commitment (e.g., being involved in too many projects would get you rejected as I do not wish to overwork someone)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Having a criminal history on a felony level (U.S. and Canadian law will be the base for determining this)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Having a history of leaking or spoiling media (e.g., recording an exclusive theatre screening of the latest BFDI episode and uploading it onto your account, or leaking scenes or screenshots from shows you worked on but do not own).
* \~\~\~ Please note that, for your privacy, I will not be looking into any offsite accounts you own. **This is, unless, most of your only activity happens outside of Reddit, in which case you are to tell me that.**
* You must realize that **you will not be paid for your role,** as I am a minor and cannot legally own a PayPal account or something.

There is no set deadline for auditioning. I will close auditions once I have chosen voice actors for every character. Good luck to those auditioning! :3",1,1745652292.0,RecordThisForFree,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
For three years of marriage to Dylan Stone, he never touched me on the grounds of being allergic to women.  
  
On our third anniversary, he accidentally consumed a drugged drink. When I volunteered to be his remedy, he slammed the door in my face.  
  
Until midnight, I stumbled upon him bursting into his sister-in-law's room. The passion I had never seen before cut deep into my eyes.  
  
""Vanessa, I want... you. Why the hell didn't you choose me back then?""  
  
""My brother's gone now. Let me take care of you, please?""  
  
Standing outside the door, I trembled with rage. I went crazy and made a big deal out of this, causing his sister-in-law's suicide that very night.  
  
Later, Dylan hated me so much that he orchestrated my family's bankruptcy, drove my parents' deaths, and ultimately sent me to a private club where I was humiliated until dead.  
  
When I opened my eyes again, I found myself at the beginning of this nightmare...  
  
This time, I stopped that drugged glass of wine before it handed to Dylan.  
  
\---  
  
""Sir, your drink is here.""  
  
""Dylan, why are you still so fond of this Whiskey Sunrise? Is it really that good?""  
  
Whiskey Sunrise...  
  
The noise around me was like a bad DJ set—blaring and grating, making my head throb. Someone had opened a window, letting in a cold breeze.  
  
The cold air was like a jolt of electricity, and suddenly it hit me—  
  
I was rebirth.  
  
Back to the day of our third anniversary.  
  
Tonight was when Dylan would drink that drugged glass of wine.  
  
It's exactly that drink which led to my family's destruction and my death with eyes wide open, unable to find peace.  
  
Dylan and I were betrothed since birth. From the moment I was born, I was taught that one day I would marry into the Stone family.  
  
So I had no choice but love Dylan.  
  
After marriage, Dylan and I were like two polite strangers under the same roof with none of any husband-and-wife intimacy.  
  
Friends advised me to be proactive, saying that once married, I needed to capture both his heart and body.  
  
So I tried everything to please him, to seduce him.  
  
Looking back now, I was like a cheap hooker.  
  
Once, I even pretended to fall in the bathroom to lure him in. But facing my naked body, he didn't even glance at me. He just grabbed a bathrobe nearby and covered me.  
  
Then he said, cold as ice, ""Don't ever do that again. It's really trashy.""  
  
The word ""trashy"" branded me like a hot iron, leaving me unable to get rid of it anyway.  
  
After that incident, he showed me a medical report stating he was allergic to women. I believed it was true and spent countless sleepless nights worrying about his condition.  
  
I personally sought out renowned doctors, both domestic and international. And what do I get? Just a cold shoulder and a flat-out ""Don't bother"".  
  
It wasn't until that that accidental drug incident that revealed his passionate side.  
  
That's when I learned he wasn't allergic to women—he just didn't love me.  
  
He was in love with Vanessa, his late elder brother's wife.  
  
From a shadowy corner, Dylan was being flattered by a group of people. Following his gaze, I spotted Vanessa alone across the room, sipping wine.  
  
Watching the server carrying the drink toward Dylan, I rushed forward and knocked over the glass.  
  
The glass shattered, wine spilling everywhere.  
  
Dylan's clothes—his shirt and pants—were stained with wine.  
  
He frowned as he stood up, his eyes filled with displeasure as he looked at me:  
  
""Claire Sullivan, what are you doing?!""  
  
I stared at the mess on the floor, my heart skipping a beat.  
  
Whiskey Sunrise was Dylan's favorite drink—whiskey base, dry white champagne, and orange. In his words, it had a mellow taste with a lingering finish.  
  
Before, I never understood why he loved this unremarkable cocktail so much.  
  
Later I discovered it wasn't the drink he loved, but that Vanessa was the one who created it.  
  
""You can't drink this.""  
  
Countless explanations came to mind, but all I said was this one sentence.  
  
Dylan's friends exchanged glances, their eyes darting between Vanessa and me.  
  
With a cold laugh. Only then did I realize that everyone knew about Dylan's feelings for Vanessa, except me, his wife.  
  
Endless whispers echoed in my heart, making my chest ache.  
  
""I wasn't planning to drink it anyway.""  
  
At Dylan's words, everyone fell silent.  
  
Behind me came a crash—Vanessa's glass had also shattered on the floor.  
  
I noticed then that the way Dylan looked at me had changed—no longer indifference, but hatred.  
  
Before the previous drugging incident, Dylan and I had always maintained a calm, peaceful relationship. He shouldn't be looking at me with such eyes.  
  
""Claire, don't think I don't know you drugged this drink.""  
  
Dylan leaned close to my ear, speaking through clenched teeth.  
  
That's when I realized I wasn't the only one who had come back—Dylan had too.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I instinctively turned to look at him, and when our eyes met, I saw his hatred for me.  
  
In my previous life, he always believed I had drugged the drink, deliberately setting him up to expose his affair with Vanessa. He hated that I had made it public knowledge.  
  
In a private club room, he watched as I was tortured and abused to death.  
  
Even when I knelt before him, crying and begging, saying I hadn't drugged the drink, he didn't stop.  
  
""Claire Sullivan, you tainted Vanessa's reputation, so I'll make sure you die covered in shame. I hope even in the six feet under, everyone will despise you.""  
  
His eyes were like icy swords, each glance felt like slow torture.  
  
As our gazes overlapped endlessly, I snapped back to reality, trembling with fear.  
  
Just then, Vanessa's voice came from behind me.  
  
""Claire, I mixed this drink for Dylan. It was just to thank him for helping my brother with his school issues, nothing more.""  
  
Vanessa rushed over with an apologetic face, holding my hand affectionately as she explained.  
  
But every glance she cast at Dylan was filled with tender affection.  
  
In my previous life, when I married into the Stone family, Dylan's older brother had already passed away.  
  
Dylan repeatedly asked me to take special care of Vanessa. I took his words to heart and was wholeheartedly good to her.  
  
I took her out for fun, introduced her to connections, helped expand her business, and whenever I bought something for myself, I always got one for her too.  
  
I even confided in her about Dylan's refusal to touch me.  
  
Back then, she comforted me, gave me advice. And most of my seduction techniques came from her, which made Dylan think I was inherently trashy.  
  
Now I realize how stupid I was in my previous life. I completely missed all those emotions flowing between them.  
  
""It's okay, I don't mind.""  
  
I pretended nothing had happened and left the venue.  
  
Behind me, I could hear Dylan's friends teasing, saying I had always been jealous since childhood and low-class shit.  
  
Before, I would have rushed back to argue with them.  
  
But in this new life, I would never choose to do that again, just wanted to leave.  
  
At the party, Dylan introduced Vanessa to many people, as if they were the couple.  
  
I acted like nothing was wrong and waited idly for the party to end.  
  
Until I passed that room on the first floor again, where soft moans escaped from the half-closed door.  
  
Through the crack, I once again saw Dylan's eyes filled with passion.  
  
In this life, they were moving faster than in the previous one.  
  
Vanessa was already half-undressed, with clothes scattered across the small room.  
  
""Vanessa... I'm so over losing you. Let's be a thing, yeah?""  
  
Amid Vanessa's rapid breathing came soft whimpers.  
  
Just then, Dylan suddenly looked up, and also through the door crack, his eyes met mine.  
  
His vicious gaze contained a warning, like a fierce tiger ready to tear me apart.  
  
I didn't burst in crying and shouting even alerted all the elders like in my previous life.  
  
I just expressionlessly pulled the door closed, then stopped a nearby server:  
  
""This room is a prayer room. I've locked it, so don't go in unless necessary.""  
  
My mind involuntarily recalled the tragic fate of myself and my family. Closing this door seemed to give us a chance at survival.  
  
Having survived my previous fate, I went to the small garden for fresh air. Turning back to look at the scene inside with people toasting and drinking, my heart grew colder.  
  
Although it was our third anniversary celebration, it made no difference whether I was there or not. Everyone, with Dylan's implicit permission, ignored me.  
  
In my previous life, I had been so focused on how to seduce Dylan that I hadn't noticed any of this.  
  
Come back to life, my awareness gradually became clearer, and all the details from my previous life now formed a complete picture.  
  
I laughed bitterly, then heard a teasing voice behind me:  
  
""Your husband's been stolen, and you're still laughing?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I turned around and saw that stunningly handsome face in the darkness, lips curled in a faint smile, arms crossed as he looked at me.  
  
It was Jason Reid, my lifelong rival.  
  
I don't know if it was the heavy night or if the earlier wine had gone to my head.  
  
I moved closer and grabbed Jason's collar, whispering in his ear:  
  
""Hey, Jason, what if I divorce him and we make this official? You and me—what do you say?""  
  
A strong, steady heartbeat fell on my ears.  
  
I don't even remember how I got back to my room. I only know that when I woke up, my head was pounding like a drum.  
  
Looking at the divorce agreement Jason had sent to my phone, I was shocked by what I'd done last night.  
  
""No cap!""  
  
These brief words reminded me of everything about Jason.  
  
The Reid family was the most prominent family in New York City. If I left the Stone family, Jason would be my only choice.  
  
By the time I got dressed and went downstairs, Dylan and Vanessa were already at the breakfast table.  
  
Dylan gave me a cold look and casually mocked:  
  
""On our third anniversary, we couldn't even find you when seeing guests off.""  
  
""Claire, if you don't want to be a Stone daughter-in-law anymore, just say it. Plenty of women would love to take your place.""  
  
Dylan's voice was neither loud nor soft, but his sarcasm was obvious.  
  
In my previous life, I loved Dylan. I was so brainwashed by my upbringing since childhood that I couldn't even like anyone other than him.  
  
But now, such a painful death had completely killed my love for this man I had loved for over twenty years.  
  
""Then I won't be one anymore. Let someone who wants it take the position.""  
  
I glanced lightly at Vanessa.  
  
Today she wore a low-cut sweater, its loose neckline revealing hickeys that even concealer couldn't hide. Anyone with a brain knew she was doing it deliberately.  
  
""I'll sign the divorce agreement and give it to you.""  
  
Dylan's hand holding the fork paused. Looking up at me, his deep eyes filled with disbelief.  
  
After all, I had followed him like a shadow since childhood. Everyone knew I loved him desperately and would marry no one else.  
  
Dylan gave me a death stare, then got up and left.  
  
I carried my coffee to the small garden for breakfast.  
  
Then Vanessa followed me. ""Are you really divorcing Dylan? Claire, did you see what happened last night? I can explain. Dylan and I aren't what you think...""  
  
Vanessa barely spoke a few sentences before her eyes reddened.  
  
I watched her pretend to be pitiful as always and felt extremely impatient. I violently shook off Vanessa's hand.  
  
To my surprise, Vanessa screamed and threw herself against a nearby sculpture.  
  
""Claire Sullivan!""  
  
Coincidentally, Dylan was coming downstairs, ready to leave.  
  
He rushed over to hold Vanessa, pointing at me in rage: ""I knew your kindness to Vanessa was all an act for me! Behind my back, you only bully her! I tell you, this time I won't allow you to hurt her even a little bit!""  
  
Vanessa in his arms was sobbing, gasping for breath, calling Dylan's name.  
  
Dylan grabbed my arm and forced me to apologize to Vanessa:  
  
""Apologize! Otherwise, I'll throw you to the dogs on the back mountain today!""  
  
The back mountain was where Dylan's grandfather kept several Tibetan mastiffs, raised on raw meat and extremely ferocious.  
  
""I'm sorry.""  
  
I just wanted to leave peacefully, without causing any more trouble. So without any defense, I respectfully bowed to Vanessa and apologized.  
  
With no room to make a scene, Dylan could only carry Vanessa into the house, shouting for someone to call a doctor.  
  
A minor injury, causing such a commotion.  
  
I listened to the noise outside and calmly packed my things. Halfway through, there was a knock at the door.  
  
""It's not your fault. Dylan just cares too much about me. I've already talked to him...""  
  
Looking at Vanessa's pretense, I lost patience.  
  
I took the divorce agreement from the table and got straight to the point:  
  
""Vanessa, I don't know if you like Dylan or not. But Dylan likes you. Go to his study and see for yourself.""  
  
""Here's the divorce agreement with my signature. Find a way to get him to sign it. It's good for both of us.""

Buzz... buzz... - You look up; you notice your phone is vibrating. You glance over, reach for it, and slowly unlock it; as you are captivated by the notification, you tap -- it opens the app, lights flashing, reflecting off your face. What is your update? Your stock order is executed! Yes, you're slowly building your portfolio; you will be rich! (Please hold your horses.) You continue tapping around your phone, devouring the information about your stock, clicking on different stocks and news headlines and debating about buying and selling various items in your portfolio. What is lost in this process is the appreciation of how lucky you are. Why? Because you are born in a time where you have access to stable financial institutions that make it easier than it was for your ancestors to find financing for a business and share in the wealth creation process with the general public. So, let's look back at a time when it wasn't possible to move millions of dollars while sitting on your toilet. Our story starts with agriculture. Yes, yes, I know... many of you are shaking your heads. But don't worry, it's not boring! Farming may be overlooked, but it has played a crucial role in human progress, especially during the Agricultural Revolution. During this period, humans transitioned from a migratory hunter-gatherer society to a sprawling, settled civilization. Now that humans couldn’t follow their prey’s migration patterns, they had to find an alternative source of their food. So, humans started developing farming, cultivating and breeding techniques to fill the gap in their food supply. The incentives were simple: if you could concentrate a large number of people, you could distribute tasks and responsibilities more effectively, and if you could produce more food, it would free some in your community to focus on innovations, exploration, and expanding your territory. But producing all that food wasn't easy. It required proper preparation, equipment, and resources. So, what did farmers do? They sought out people willing to trust them and take a risk. In exchange for a share of their future harvest, these early “investors” provided farmers with the means to buy seeds, acquire equipment, and hire labour. This early financing system laid the groundwork for more sophisticated monetary instruments in the centuries to come. The farming lending practices spurred a slow evolution of financial instruments. The next step in developing a financial instrument was the process of securitization, which involves creating a transferable asset. The earliest mentions of securitization can be traced back to Mesopotamia, where merchants and traders utilized promissory notes and early forms of credit to “keep track” of debt. Here, the ideas of interest-bearing loans and the notion that risk should be compensated emerged, allowing civilization to take a step forward toward a more advanced stage. Fun fact: the loans were recorded on cuneiform tablets or on the walls of important buildings. Considering the time context, these ""instruments"" were mostly limited to direct person-to-person transactions and religious lending practices. This limitation didn't allow for greater financing and evolution. If we want to find the root of what we consider exchanges, we will need to fast-forward a bit and take a look at the Roman Empire. Granted, this form of exchanges is still very different from what we are familiar with today. What truly fascinates me is that, even thousands of years after the collapse of the Roman Empire, its legacy continues to bear fruit and is responsible for many elements of modern life, one of which is our financial institutions. Anyway, although Rome did not have stocks as we see them today, it did start allowing the private ownership of business enterprises. In fact, Rome is also credited with being the birthplace of the idea of a corporation. Let's put the need for corporations into context: As the Roman Empire expanded and conquered a considerable part of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, its finances were stretched thin, and the government sought ways to fund soldiers, tax collectors, and building bridges, among other expenses. The Roman Empire ""outsourced"" much of this work to these so-called ""corporations"". These corporations would try to raise capital from the public in exchange for promoting future profits. To do that, corporations issued shares called partes or particulae, which were sold to private investors. Wealthy Romans, including senators and equestrians, invested in these shares to gain returns from lucrative government contracts. The shares were transferable, and records suggest that they were actively traded in informal markets, particularly in the forum and other public spaces where business transactions occurred. Hence, we can see early seeds of what would eventually evolve into modern stock exchanges! Unfortunately, progress stalled after the collapse of the Roman Empire. This fact doesn't mean there was no progression around the world; it is just that the pace of exchange slowed (especially in Europe), and there were no giant leaps in innovation. For instance, in China, the ideas of financial solutions were evolving through merchant financing, the invention of paper money (the first in the world! First backed by silver but then backed by the full faith of the ruling government (does that sound familiar?) in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)), and sophisticated credit. However, they, too, afterward regressed and abandoned such innovation in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). In the Islamic world, innovations in accounting were introduced (some debate that it was introduced in Florance, more in a bit), such as double-entry bookkeeping and mathematical innovation. Though interest was forbidden due to religious principles, profit-sharing models like mudaraba and musharaka thrived, distributing risk and reward in ways that later influenced Western finance. Now, let's return to where we left off in our story: Europe, more specifically, just north of where exchange-related ideas sprouted in Rome. In the 14th-16th centuries, the Italian city-states of Venice, Florence, and Genoa were developing (or using what they learned from Middle Eastern traders) sophisticated accounting, financial, and banking systems. These systems pioneered double-entry bookkeeping (again, it could have been pioneered in the Islamic world), brought banking mainstream, popularized banking systems as replicable systems across the European continent, and enabled trading debt (a breakthrough in Florance!). The Venetian government also issued securities known as prestige to finance war efforts. These securities could be traded on secondary markets, representing an essential precursor to formal stock exchanges. These innovations made northern Italy a vast trading and financial centre. Many took ideas found here to catapult their empire to newfound levels. This was the start of an important time in Europe—the age of exploration! Two empires greatly benefitted from the financial innovation in Italy: the Spanish and Portuguese empires. By the early 16th century, Spain and Portugal were amassing wealth from their voyages and ""trade"" in the Americas and Asia, their treasuries amassing mountains of gold and silver. The Spanish empire had many aspirations at the time, from fighting on their border with the Ottomans, French, and Protestant farmers to living extravagantly with global ambitions. Italian bankers, especially from Genoa, played a key role, lending to the Habsburgs (rulers of the Spanish crown) and managing their debt through bonds and bills of exchange. This demonstrated a very important fact, the Italian system is replicable. Following the royal family's footsteps, Merchants across these empires saw an opportunity. They adopted Italian financial tools such as debt trading, credit instruments, and risk-sharing to fund their trade ventures, from spices to slaves, often independently of royal coffers. As merchant trade grew, the merchant class' incentives shifted towards relocating to a stable commercial hub to concentrate their efforts, a place with enough trade and opportunity to thrive. They found that sweet spot in Antwerp. Located in modern-day Belgium, Antwerp was then part of the Habsburg-controlled Low Countries (the County of Flanders). Its access to the North Sea (with the help of the Scheldt River) made it a crossroads for access to Spain, Portugal, Italy, and northern Europe. Unlike other Habsburg-controlled corners of the empire, Antwerp offered a relatively stable environment where commerce flourished. Here, merchants operated with a degree of autonomy. They didn't flee Spain quite yet (that came later, under Philip II's harsher reign). Still, they gravitated to freer markets rooted in Italian banking traditions, creating fertile ground for financial innovation. In 1531, Antwerp opened the world's first purpose- built exchange (wow, we made it!): the Antwerp Bourse, designed by architect Damien de Waghemakere. This exchange wasn't a stock market as we know it—no company shares were traded here (we're getting close, I promise). Instead, it served as a vibrant venue for trading government debt (Habsburg war bonds), commodity contracts (wool, metals, spices), and bills of exchange. The Antwerp Bourse was supported by Charles V (ruler of the Low Countries), who valued its economic output and created an environment that brought structure to these markets, enforcing rules for formalized trade and fair practices. Merchants from across Europe flocked to this trading paradise. By centralizing commerce under one roof, Antwerp cemented its dominance as the continent's financial hub, outshining even its predecessors. Antwerp's glory, however, was not long-lasting. Its peak in the mid-16th century coincided with growing tensions in the Habsburg realm. Under the new Habsburg king (Philip II), the Spanish crown tightened its control over the Low Countries, which led to a Dutch revolt in 1568 and, subsequently, the fall of Antwerp in



1. Many merchants fled to the north (Amsterdam) and took their practices and lessons with them, plating the foundation of the next evolution. Antwerp's innovations didn't vanish. They migrated to Amsterdam. Merchants consolidation led to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange opening in 1602. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is known to be the first real stock market; it started with the trade of the most important company of the time, the Dutch East India Company (VOC). VOC brought a huge innovation: shares that could always be traded on the exchange without the company's say-so (before this, stakes in trading ventures were usually ended when a ship got back, and the owner would get paid out). Moreover, this permanent capital structure allowed the VOC to grow into the world's first multinational corporation. The Amsterdam Exchange introduced the idea of stock and pioneered the trade of futures, options, and other instruments, mirroring modern exchanges. Even more impressive is that by the early 1800s, speculators could short securities and use margin accounts! Media also evolved to provide price quotations, creating transparency in the marketplace. Yet, these improvements introduced newfound risks. In 1636–1637, Amsterdam was struck with Tulip Mania, history's first major asset bubble. The Dutch began trading tulips as if they were the world's most expensive assets and speculation drove tulip bulb prices sky-high that one flower could fetch generational wealth at the peak, outpacing a skilled craftsman's yearly earnings tenfold. The rise didn't last forever (a very cool time in history, I recommend googling it) when the bubble burst in February 1637, fortunes evaporated (people were stranded with the now worthless flowers), teaching harsh lessons about market psychology that resonate today. Dutch financial power endured through the 17th century, underpinned by a stable currency and innovative banking. However, it didn't last forever. The stock market's history—and the world's financial center—shifted again, partly due to the Anglo-Dutch Wars (1652–1674), which drained Dutch naval supremacy, allowing the British naval to eclipse them and partly due to England's rise as a trade haven with more favourable laws. Merchants began meeting in London's coffee houses, laying the groundwork for a new financial hub. By the late 17th century, Amsterdam's dominance waned, and London emerged as the next great empire's economic heart. You might be thinking London? The London that hosted the capital of the largest empire we have ever seen and the one with that royal family? Precisely. During this time, the British Empire was growing in relevance. Its ""success"" during the Anglo-Dutch Wars and the subsequent defeat of France in the War of the Spanish Succession opened England to inherit the new center of commerce. The British were well positioned. They had plenty of newfound trade routes and the prospect of trade across the Americas. Now that merchants were migrating, you may be curious as to where these merchants met. Business merchants would meet at coffee houses; however, this wasn't the modern-day equivalent of a Starbucks fix. It was a place where deals were struck, rumours spread, and fortunes won and lost over steaming cups. Jonathan's Coffee House, in particular, was the Wall Street of its day. Speaking of the Americas, the Spanish had shown the riches possible in exploration (with Spain filling up their coffers with silver and gold from the Americas), and merchants were looking for the next big opportunity. What do you know, one such opportunity could be ""found"" in the South Sea Company. The South Sea Company was responsible for trade that occurred with the Spanish colonization. It was special because after the government was burdened with debt, it sold the debt in exchange for granting the South Sea company a monopoly on trade with the Spanish colonies in South America – a vast, largely unknown territory that conjured images of endless silver and gold. The South Sea Company wasn't just another stock; it was wrapped in a cloak of nationalistic fervour and the allure of untapped potential. People sold their houses, speculated on their assets, and even took loans from loan sharks for the chance to get a piece of the action (a piece of the company). However, the reality was far less glamorous. Trade with these colonies was limited, and the company's actual profits were meager. Yet, fueled by aggressive promotion, insider trading, and a contagious wave of speculative mania, the price of its shares skyrocketed. People weren't buying based on fundamentals (which were weak); they were buying because the price was going up, expecting it to climb even higher and sell it to the next sucker (the classic ""greater fool"" theory in action). Even Sir Isaac Newton, one of history's greatest minds, lost a fortune in the speculation. He originally invested and made a lot of money when he sold at a price he considered unrealistic. Tempted by the rising price and with the fear of missing out as the stock kept climbing, he plunged back in, staking a future, and unfortunately got burned by the bubble pop. His famous quote afterwards—""I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people""—shows the fundamental challenge that markets have always faced: human psychology often doesn't make sense. The Bank of England started in 1694 and became increasingly important in creating financial stability after the South Sea mess. Unlike earlier institutions, the Bank developed ways to act as a lender of last resort during liquidity crises (much like central banks do today). The London Stock Exchange wasn't formally established until 1801, even after hypertrading took place. This institutionalization brought more regulation and standardized practices, making London the world's financial capital throughout the 19th century (historians accurize its dominance until the end of WW2). Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the newfound nation of the United States was growing as a new business center. In contrast to mainland Britain, the United States and its predecessor the 13 colonies, were spread out over a vast area, which meant merchant hubs were scattered across the eastern coast of the modern-day United States. These merchants operated with a certain degree of decentralization before the inevitable consolidation and pull toward hubs (such as New York, Chicago, and Pittsburgh). Imagine those early days: not grand halls, but rather informal gatherings, deals struck perhaps with a handshake on a dusty corner or within the boisterous confines of a tavern. However, much of the organization was still chaotic, with varying commissions to get deals done and shady dealers with fake credentials running scams. As the number of merchants grew, many became more hesitant; there needed to be a structure and trusted face for these transactions. The most romanticized of these origin stories in creating a system of exchange is the Buttonwood Agreement of 1792. Picture it: twenty-four brokers, under the shade of a buttonwood tree on Wall Street in New York, laying down the rudimentary rules of engagement, setting commission standards and establishing a pecking order. This exchange wasn't the polished marble and hushed tones of later exchanges; it was the raw, foundational moment for what would become the mighty New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). And with this formation, commerce expanded exponentially. Even in their rudimentary forms, these early exchanges laid the groundwork for critical economic functions that endure even today. They established centralized marketplaces where buyers and sellers could efficiently converge, fostering transparency and enabling the crucial price discovery process. Before these organized markets, if you wanted to sell part of a business, you had to find a buyer yourself – a real headache that often led to wildly different prices for the same asset. The market's invisible hand operates most effectively when prices are transparent to all participants. But how did this dusty corner- stop evolve into the glamorous exchange building we are all familiar with today. At the start, when there were limited participants, it was quite straightforward. However, as this street corner became well known and the population expanded, this new exchange venue hit a roadblock. Imagine standing at Times Square or a busy intersection and trying to find someone else. It's tough! So, resourceful brokers had to become clever. They sought out to rent balconies and windows overlooking the street corner and would make buyers and sellers find them! For a time, this worked great; however, as it became more crowded, it became very hard to see who was who in a crowd. The genius solution? Wear colourful blazers and eye-catching hats! It never ceases to amaze me, as human ingenuity is genuinely remarkable. The last evolution before the exchange migrated to a physical location with those polished marble floors was the creation of hand signals. When streets were crowded, signalling what you wanted rather than yelling and hoping your partner could hear what you said properly was easier. This is the era of the 19th-century American market. We must remember that just like the movies of the Wild West, this market, much like the absence of glamour and infrastructure, was the Wild West of exchanges. Regulation? A whisper in the wind. Market manipulation? As common as the midday sun. Names like Jay Gould, Jim Fisk, and Daniel Drew weren't lauded for their ethical prowess; they earned the moniker ""robber barons"" for tactics that would make a modern regulator shudder (even the Wolf of Wall Street has nothing on them). And then there was Cornelius Vanderbilt, a man who famously quipped, ""What do I care about the law? Hain't I got the power?"" – a sentiment that unfortunately echoed in the market's freewheeling nature. Practices like ""corners,"" where a few players would amass enough shares to corner the market and squeeze short sellers into ruinous positions, and ""pools,"" where investors would band together to inflate prices artificially, were commonplace. It was a period where fortunes could be made and lost with breathtaking speed, often divorced from any real underlying value. However, as you may see, there are limits to how much these markets could expand. If you had been burned a few times in the market, you may be wary of it. So, an evolution was necessary for the system to grow, a shock that would force the government to intervene and create the pillars of the modern market. Numerous market manias have gathered the public eye, such as runs on banks in the late 1890s and the market panic of 1908, but the main trigger for the inevitable need for reform came with the exuberant run of the ""Roaring 20s"" (in the 1920s). During this time, ""playing the market"" became ""America's sport,"" with regular people borrowing heavily to buy shares and rising prices with no end. The music was playing; however, once the music stopped...so did the economy. Then came the crash in October 1929. The Great Crash wiped out billions and started the Great Depression. Market values fell by nearly 90% from top to bottom. The severity and length of the economic pain that followed changed Americans' relationship with financial markets and led to big regulatory reforms. The biggest of these was the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934 – the first real attempt to establish a robust regulatory framework for securities markets. This new body was responsible for stopping insider trading (where company insiders used non-public information for their own gain), market manipulation tactics (such as wash sales (selling to yourself) designed to create a false sense of trading activity), and the requirement for public companies to become more transparent (forcing them to provide accurate financial information and creating reporting standards). The reforms and the repositioning of the United States as the financial capital of the world (post World War 2) accelerated the integration of the stock exchanges. The NYSE had established itself as the world's preeminent stock exchange by mid-century, with its trading floor becoming an iconic symbol of American capitalism with the help of new innovations. The telegram (In 1867), along with the growing usage of the stock ticker, allowed stock quotation to be broadcasted across the nation. This invasion democratized trading across the continent. The NASDAQ exchange (1971) was launched as the world's first fully electronic stock market. Here, trades were executed by computers, so there was no trading floor, no shouting brokers, and no coloured jackets – just market makers posting bids and offers via computer terminals. Yet this transition came with its own perils. The reliance on computer execution was one of the causes of the crash on Black Monday in 1987, when markets plummeted over 22.6% in a single day, forcing more market reforms and the introduction of circuit breakers. Electronic exchanges accelerated their dominance in the 90s and 00s, especially after the 9/11 attacks as the vulnerabilities of a single point of exchange was exposed as a financial weakness. Today, most trades occur over these computer networks, executing faster than humans could ever possibly do on their own. This change has given rise to the high- frequency trading industry, where trades happen at the speed of light through fiber optic cables, sometimes with firms competing for offices physically closer to exchanges to shave microseconds off execution times. What took floor brokers minutes can now happen thousands of times per second. The advantages are clear: lower costs, faster execution, and increased liquidity. But like any powerful tool, these systems have brought new concerns about fairness and stability, culminating in events like the 2010 Flash Crash that sent markets plunging temporarily. Today, the exchanges are responsible for over 58,000 companies representing trillions of dollars in market capitalization (NYSE at $25 trillion and NASDAQ with $23 trillion, although these figures change day to day). Many of the exchanges are public companies themselves, worth billions! Nonetheless, it is clear that technology will continue to play a large role in the markets and reshape the exchanges. Perhaps blockchain will further decentralize and bring greater transparency. Artificial intelligence could possibly create new surveillance of the mechanics behind market algorithms. Perhaps even further government involvement will change things. However, one thing is certain: no matter the current form of evolution, as long as human actors are present, the exchanges will be riddled with market panics and foolish optimism, and their essential function—matching buyers with sellers and establishing reliable prices—will remain as relevant tomorrow as it was in the Roman Forum centuries ago.

Original asking price was 28, dealership discounted it to 25,700 a few weeks ago and I was able to get about 1,300-1,400 off the car at the dealership. (These numbers are a rough, not exact). I have not had a car payment in almost 2 years since paying off my 2016 Chevy Cruze. I needed an upgrade solely due to space. I have a daughter currently but would like 2-3 more children. It is a certified used car with a warranty I added on for the transmission and extra non maintenance coverage for 84 months, essentially the lifespan of the vehicle loan. 
My monthly payments will be 493 dollars. After calculating my monthly bills (which I went over several times at the dealership) I will have estimated 313 dollars of wiggle room each month. Probably closer to 213 if you factor in gas. 
I am having major regrets about this purchase. Without the car payment, the extra 493 would likely be spent on extra unnecessary purchases with an addition to a few needed items. 
It just seems very unconventional, almost impossible to live off of only 213 dollars extra. I want to return the car, I am having buyers remorse.

PRE-INTRODUCTION

Hello again. It's lovely to see that I have not lost all of you! This next project was meant as a single short write-up on the great monopolistic business of stock exchanges. To introduce the topic, this crash course of sorts would cover the topics of history, the types of exchanges, the business models, the variety, the regulatory framework, differences around the world, etc. However, as I started putting pen to paper, the piece got very long and gained a life of its own. Therefore, I decided to break the work into multiple pieces instead of narrowing it down and sacrificing valuable explanations for those exploring these topics for the first time. For those already familiar with the topic, feel free to open the section that interests you or await for the next write-up (on a specific exchange coming soon!), For the rest of you, I will try my best not to lose you all. I will try to explain it, bring relatable examples, and keep it shortish. P.S. A full PDF can be found HERE. Sections can be found in the PDF:

INTRODUCTION

I believe we are fortunate to be living in the 21st century with access to capital markets. Every day, there are trillions of dollars worth of transactions that flow through the world's exchanges. Money flows from one pair of hands to another, changing ownership of assets in what is truly the epitome of capitalism: the exchange, the single most influential entry for business. 

These marketplaces sit at the very heart of our economic system. They help capitalism work by connecting those who need capital with those who have it to invest. They fund businesses, allow everybody to participate in the miracle of capitalism, and give everyone a chance at ownership of the best assets humanity has created. 

As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once observed, the stock market has evolved to become a window into the economy itself. This powerful leading indicator reflects not just where we are but where we're collectively heading. It's no coincidence that economists, policymakers, and business leaders observe market movements carefully. The activity on the exchanges illustrates the aggregated opinion of all the participants who make billions of decisions a day. 

Most of us interact with these markets directly or indirectly. For example, our retirement funds are invested in stocks and bonds traded on these exchanges. University endowments, charitable foundations, pension funds, insurance companies – virtually all major financial institutions place significant portions of their capital in markets. There's a deep, fundamental relationship between these exchanges and the broader economy, each factor influencing the other in a complex dance that affects everyone. 

These exchanges are the cornerstones of capitalism, the foundations upon which modern economies are built. Yet, how many of us have ever stopped to think: What is a stock exchange, really? How does it actually work? Do we need it? Who controls it? Does the government influence it? Following this train of thought, let's dive deeper into our curiosity about why we use exchanges at all. How do exchanges enable these massive, complex operations? How do the actual exchanges themselves make money? And did you know that many of these exchange operators are publicly traded companies that you can own? 

Over the next few write-ups, we're going to study the business of exchanges. We will try to build a foundation upon which we can uncover these secrets. We'll examine several of the publicly traded exchange operators and understand whether you should consider these amazing businesses for your own investment portfolio. 

In the CliffsNotes version of this piece, I formulate the opinion that exchanges are fascinating businesses with characteristics Warren Buffett has always loved – wide moats (significant competitive advantage), network effects (think snowball rolling down a hill the bigger you get, the faster you roll), capital-light operations (doesn't need a lot of money to keep business running) and tollbooth-like economics (unavoidable fee collection). Once established, exchanges tend to enjoy natural monopolies or oligopolies, creating enduring competitive advantages. 

Unlike most businesses that must reinvent themselves to stay relevant, stock exchanges have existed for centuries while maintaining the same essential function: efficiently bringing buyers and sellers together. For example, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, would be recognizable in purpose (if not in technology) to a modern trader on the New York Stock Exchange. 

What makes exchanges particularly interesting from an investment perspective is that they combine the stability of essential infrastructure with growth opportunities in new financial products, data services, and geographic expansion. They're positioned at the crossroads of nearly every major economic trend. 

So join me as we explore this business that sits at the very foundation of our capitalist system – the business of making markets. We'll look at how exchanges evolved, how they operate today, how they make money, the regulatory frameworks they navigate, and ultimately, whether they might deserve a place in your portfolio. 

What is a an Exchange? 

At its most basic level, an exchange is a marketplace where securities—stocks, bonds, options, futures, and other financial instruments (more on them in a bit)—are bought and sold. But unlike the farmer's market, where you can see the vegetables and haggle with the seller, exchanges deal in ownership rights that exist primarily as electronic records where you constantly have buyers and sellers exchanging at a price. 

For example, when you see a stock price displayed on your screen, say, Apple (AAPL) at $212.53, what you're actually seeing is the price at which the last recorded public transaction transpired. This ""last price"" is simply a record of what someone was willing to pay and someone else was willing to accept for a share of Apple at a specific moment in time. The other prices you may see are bid and asks; 
 - The bid is the highest price a buyer is currently willing to pay for a share 
 - The ask (or offer) is the lowest price a seller is currently willing to accept 
 - The difference between these two is called the spread 

This spread might be just a penny for highly liquid (high number of transactions in a short time) stocks like Apple. It could be substantial for thinly traded stocks (stocks that change hands rarely). The exchanges maintain an ""order book"" that lists all the bids and asks, creating a marketplace where buyers and sellers meet. 

Major Exchanges Around the World The world's stock exchanges vary enormously in size, with the largest dwarfing the smallest: 

 - New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) - The world's largest exchange by market capitalisation, hosting over 2,300 companies valued at over $25 trillion. 
 - NASDAQ - The second-largest exchange, home to many technology giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. 
 - Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) - The largest in Asia, listing over 3,700 companies. 
 - Shanghai Stock Exchange - China's largest exchange and one of the most restrictive for foreign investors. 
 - Euronext - A pan-European exchange operating markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Oslo, Milan, and Paris. 
 - London Stock Exchange (LSE) - One of Europe's oldest exchanges and a financial center. 
 - Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) - A critical link between mainland China and international investors. 
 - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) - Canada's largest, particularly strong in natural resources and mining. 

There are many others around the globe. Some exchanges focus on commodities, some on bonds, and some are full-fledged ecosystems. 

Types of Exchanges

Exchanges have evolved dramatically over the centuries, but we can broadly categorise modern exchanges into two different types: 

Floor-Based Exchanges - The Farmers' Market of Stocks 

When you think of the stock market with traders running, yelling, and flashing lights as depicted in movies, you are thinking of Floor-Based Exchanges. Floor-based exchanges operate on similar principles as farmers' markets. Picture traders in their colourful jackets, shouting and waving their arms to buy and sell stocks, like farmers bargaining over the price of corn or apples. On a traditional trading floor: 
 - Designated market makers (formerly called specialists) are assigned specific stocks, and the parallel in a farmers' market would be each stall owner. 
 - Floor brokers execute trades on behalf of clients; on a farmers' market, this would be the customers passing the stalls. 
- Open outcry (hand signals and verbal bids) was traditionally used, which is what you are familiar depicted in movies. 

The image of traders in colourful jackets shouting orders, running from one end to the next and chaos on the floor is historical mainly at this point. Even the NYSE (the most famous example of a floor-based exchange) floor is now primarily a television studio with some minimal trading functions rather than the chaotic scenes depicted in movies. The main reason? It's simply more efficient, accurate, reliable, faster and less chaotic to let computers execute the trades. As volumes rose (amount of trades happening) and technology improved, floor traders became obsolete.

Electronic Exchanges - The Amazon.com of Trading

As floor-based exchange became obsolete, computers and algorithms took over the main functions. These exchanges are called electronic exchanges. Think of them like an Amazon.com of the exchange world; every action is done faster than you can snap your fingers. Most modern exchanges are fully electronic, including: 
- NASDAQ - Never had a trading floor, pioneering the electronic model 
- Euronext Operates a fully electronic trading platform 
- Most newer exchanges worldwide - Built on electronic models from inception 

In electronic exchanges, computer systems match buyers and sellers automatically. This fact means unlike on floor-based exchanges where trades could take minutes, they occur in milliseconds. Moreover, you don't need to rely on contacting a trader to place an order; you just need a screen! 

This shift to electronic trading has dramatically increased the speed and volume of transactions while reducing costs. The NYSE might execute over 3 billion shares on a typical day, a volume that would have been unimaginable in the era of purely manual trading. That said, I'll tip my hat to the old days. There's something special about the human touch, the energy of a trading floor in full swing and watching the recording of the chaos on the floor it just makes it feel a lot more real. But when you're handling today's markets, you need something that can keep up. It's like choosing between a horse-drawn carriage and a Ferrari. Both will get you there, but one's a lot quicker and doesn't need a barn. 

Beyond the Mechanics 

While the technical operation of exchanges is fascinating, it's important to remember their fundamental economic role. Exchanges provide: 

 1. Price discovery - Helping determine what assets are truly worth 
 2. Liquidity - Making it possible to convert investments to cash quickly 
 3. Capital formation - Allowing companies to raise money from the public 
 4. Wealth creation and distribution - Enabling ordinary people to own pieces of successful businesses 

When you see a stock price flash across your screen, remember that behind that simple number is an intricate system bringing together buyers and sellers from around the world. This system has evolved over centuries, yet it still serves its core purpose: creating a fair, efficient marketplace where capital can flow to its most productive uses. One key feature that distinguishes exchanges from other trading platforms is the central book—and here's why that matters. 

What Is a Central Book? 

The central book (often called the central limit order book) is a centralized system that records all buy and sell orders for a specific security, like a stock. Picture it as a giant, real- time list, diary, or, more accurately, a ledger: every bid to buy and every offer to sell is logged, and orders are matched based on two simple rules—price and time. The highest bid and lowest ask are collected (see above for definitions) and get priority, and if two orders have the same price, the one placed first goes through. This setup ensures that the exchanges are transparent (everyone sees the same information) and fair (no one jumps the line unfairly). 

Why Does the Central Book Set Exchanges Apart? 

Unlike other trading platforms—say, over-the-counter (OTC) (more on this later) markets, where trades can happen privately between parties (parties agree on a price for a transaction)—stock exchanges with a central book offer a single, unified marketplace. Meaning the exact same ""screen"" for everyone. This difference brings some big advantages: 
 - Better Liquidity: With all buyers and sellers in one place, it's easier to find a match, reducing drastic price swings. 
 - Fairer Prices: Everyone sees the same bids and offers, so there's no room for hidden deals or price discrepancies. 
 - More Efficiency: Thanks to the organized system, trades are executed quickly and at the best available prices. 

This centralized approach is a huge reason why stock exchanges have been the backbone of global trading for centuries. They've fine-tuned the art of transforming the chaos of buying and selling into an orderly, reliable process. In our following sections, we'll explore how these exchanges generate revenue, how they're regulated, and why they might make interesting investment opportunities themselves. 

Types of Instruments 

Now, I am sure many of you are familiar with the variety of instruments you may encounter in a marketplace, but let's humour me for a moment and try to apply these instruments to a real-life example. 

For the purposes of this explanation, let's say we are taking over an old bookstore called Old Books INC (I know, very original name) from a family friend. We bought their business and got 100% ownership! What did we buy? We purchased a small store that sells stationery items (such as paper, pens, ink, pencils, cards) and books. 

Now that we are the proud owner of Old Book INC we have the ambition to build an online retailer to rival Amazon! We have a vision of how we can help develop the business, but we realize we need capital to make that fact a reality. How can we ever raise the necessary capital? 

1. Equity 

Option 1: Sell a Piece of the Business. 

One way you can raise the necessary capital is to sell a piece of your business. You see this on shows like Shark Tank, where business owners offer a piece of their business for cash; for example, ""we are asking for $100,000 for 25% of the business."" This process is the selling of equity in your company. Equity comes from the Latin ""aequitas,"" meaning fairness or equality. In finance, it represents a fair claim to ownership. 

There are a few different ways you can sell equity: 

 - Common Stock: This is the most fundamental form of ownership. If you sold common stock in Old Books INC., buyers would become partial owners with voting rights on major decisions like electing the board of directors. If the bookstore chain becomes profitable, these shareholders might receive dividends – a portion of the profits. If Old Books INC. eventually gets acquired by Barnes & Noble (or Chapters in Canada) for twice its current value, common shareholders would see their investment double. 
 - Preferred Stock: Some investors may want more certainty than common stock offers. You could issue preferred stock that promises a fixed 5% annual dividend, paid before any dividends go to common stockholders. These investors might be sacrificing their voting rights. Still, they get first dibs on any profits distributed and, in case of bankruptcy, would be ahead of common shareholders in any sale distributions. 
 - Warrants: Some investors may be hesitant to invest in you right now; however, they like your ambition and would like the option to invest in you in the future. They can pay a fee and you would issue warrants that give the investor the right to buy additional shares at today's prices anytime in the next five years. If Old Books INC. turns around and the share price triples, these warrants become very valuable. 
 - Rights: If you need a quick capital injection (putting cash into the business) later, you could issue rights to existing shareholders, allowing them to buy additional shares at a 15% discount – rewarding them for their loyalty while raising needed funds. 

Notes: Equity instruments are foundational to stock exchanges, traded on platforms like the NYSE or NASDAQ. 

2. Bonds (Fixed Income) 
Option 2: 

Get a Loan What if you don't want to sell your ownership of Old Book INC? Well, you can always get a loan. You gather your business plans, projections, and bank account information and head to the bank. You sit down with the representative and share your grandiose plans. The representative seems really into it—they give you a big smile, offer you a coffee, and tell you they've got your back. They head upstairs to hash out the final details with their manager. You sit there, proud and happy, your vision inching closer to reality. The representative comes back and says, ""Done deal! We're so excited to help you out—just sign here."" You read over the terms, and the bank offers you a loan with an interest rate of 25% over 5 years! You're shocked. You can't accept this deal—it's simply too much. If you borrow $100,000, you'd have to pay $225,540 by the end of the loan! Dejected, you leave the bank and start thinking of a new plan. You have a solid reputation in the neighbourhood, along with friends and family, so you decide to get a loan from the public —this is a bond. The term ""bond"" comes from the Old English ""band,"" referring to something that binds or connects—in this case, connecting a borrower to a lender through a financial obligation. 

There are a few different types of bonds: 

 - Corporate Bonds: Old Books INC. could issue $1 million (in bonds) with a 6% annual interest rate and 10-year maturity. Your rich uncle buys (lends) you $100,000, receiving $6,000 in interest payments annually, with his principal (the $100,000) returned as a lump sum after 10 years. Unlike equity investors, bondholders don't own part of the business – they're lenders with a fixed claim to interest and principal. 
 - Convertible Bonds: Maybe nobody wants to lend you at a low interest rate as they think it's too risky. To make your bonds more attractive, you might make them convertible – giving bondholders the option to convert their bonds into a predetermined number of shares (stock) instead of receiving their principal back. If Old Books INC. thrives and its stock soars, bondholders could choose to become owners instead of remaining lenders converting their loan into ownership. 
 - Zero-Coupon Bonds: Perhaps you don't want to pay interest yearly because you think you will have more cash later. You might issue zero-coupon bonds that pay no annual interest. Instead, investors buy them at a discount, giving you $600,000 for bonds with a $1 million face value (money returned to the investor once the loan expires), with the difference representing their interest earned. 

Notes: While bonds are primarily traded over-the-counter (OTC), some are listed on stock exchanges. Businesses also often hold government bonds issued by governments (e.g., U.S. treasuries, gilts) or municipal bonds, which are issued by local governments and are usually tax-exempt. This is how Warren Buffett holds cash—instead of letting money sit there, you lend it to the government for a short period to earn interest. It's like a very fancy savings account!

 3. Derivatives 

You've secured your capital and are busy building your business! Inside your bookstore, you add a cozy lounge area, serving warm drinks and baked goods to delight your customers. But as time rolls on and your business expands, you notice something tricky: the prices of goods you rely on—books, paper, flour, coffee—keep bouncing up and down throughout the year. It's a headache trying to charge customers consistent prices when your costs won't stay put. You start wondering if there's a way to lock in the prices you pay to wholesalers for books and paper, or even the flour and coffee you need. Heck, you'd even pay extra for that certainty, just to know your costs ahead of time—all you want is stability. Then your friend pipes up with an idea: derivatives. You hesitate, remembering Warren Buffett's stern warning: ""I view derivatives as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system."" Still, your friend's enthusiasm nudges you to take a closer look. The word ""derivative"" means something drawn from another source—these financial tools get their value from underlying assets. Here are some derivatives you might consider for your business: 

- Options: Imagine buying insurance that gives you the option, but doesn't force you, to buy or sell something at “x” price at a later date. That's an option! Say you're worried about a new book by the highly anticipated author's novel flopping, but you don't want to miss out on potential profits if it's the next Harry Potter. You pay the distributor a small fee for the right to buy copies at $10 each in the future without buying any right now. If the book takes off and the price soars, you cash it, securing them at $10 and selling at a profit. If it's a dud, you walk away with no obligation to buy them. Contracts like these give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a set price before or at expiration. 

- Futures: Similar to options, futures are agreements to buy or sell something at a price locked in today, but here's the catch—you're committed. For example, you want to keep selling coffee at $5 a cup in your lounge, no matter what. So, you buy a futures contract to get coffee beans at $2 per pound in six months. If bean prices drop to $1, you'll pay $2 and miss out on extra profit. But if they shoot up to $4, you're still paying $2, keeping your $5 coffee price steady. It's a trade-off for certainty. 

 -Forwards: Consider these as futures' private cousins—customized deals not traded on public exchanges. You sit down directly with another business, say a local coffee roaster, and agree to buy beans at $2 per pound next year. It's tailored to your needs, but there's no exchange to back it up—just trust between you and them. Similar to futures, but quieter and more personal. 

- Swaps: These are like swapping unpredictability for calm between contracts. Suppose your supplier gives you a rolling credit that is prime (government risk- free rate) + 2%. Another shop in town has a fixed loan at a rate of 5%. You decide you would rather know your expenses than have interest rate risk, so you pay a fee to swap contracts. The other store takes the risk of interest rate jumps, and you get peace of mind (though this is a bit fancy for a small shop and usually happens off-exchange). 

- Contracts for Difference (CFDs): These are more like a bet on price moves without owning anything. Say you think flour prices will rise next month. You agree with a broker to pocket the difference between today's $10 per bag and whatever it hits later—maybe $12—without buying the flour. If you're right, you profit; if not, you pay. It's a gamble, not a staple for running your lounge, but it's out there. 

Notes: Derivatives can tie to commodities (like your coffee and flour), equities (like books), bonds, currencies, or indices. Some, like futures and options, trade on exchanges; others, like forwards and swaps, happen over-the-counter (OTC). They could steady your costs—or, as Buffett warns, explode if mishandled. 1

 4. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Mutual Funds & Indexes 

You've mastered the financial tricks—loans, bonds, derivatives—and poured that know- how into your bookstore and lounge. Hard work pays off: your business blossoms into a regional champion with multiple locations and one step closer to staring down Amazon. As growth kicks in, you take a big leap and launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO), meaning your shares now trade on an exchange. Congrats! Something neat happens next —those shares start changing hands like hotcakes. People notice, buzz builds, and your business's valuation climbs right along with it. Suddenly, you're on the radar of mutual fund managers, your stock gets roped into indices, and it even lands in ETFs. But what are these things, and why do they matter to you? Let's break it down. 

First, Mutual Funds. These are pools of money from many investors. These pools are later managed by professional money managers and their teams (the teams get paid for their services from the pool). Some of these managers might scoop up your shares. There are two flavours: Open-End Funds, where investors buy or sell shares directly from the fund company—not on exchanges (like ordering straight from the factory) and buy sell on the valuation of what is in the basket. Then there are Closed-End Funds, which trade on exchanges like regular stocks, sometimes at a bargain or a premium to their real value (value of the baskets). If a mutual fund manager likes your bookstore's story—steady coffee sales, loyal book buyers—they might grab your stock for their fund, giving you a cash boost and bragging rights. 

Next, Indices. Think of these as scoreboards tracking a bunch of stocks—like the Dow Jones or S&P 500. They don't trade on their own, but they're the backbone for other tools. As your business grows, it might get added to an index, say one for retail or small-cap champs. That's a badge of honour—it means you're a player. Plus, it ties into derivatives (like those index options or futures we talked about) and ETFs (more on this in a second), pulling more eyes your way. 

And then there's Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Picture a basket of goodies—stocks, bonds, whatever—where you buy one share and get a tiny slice of everything inside instead of buying each piece separately. Your stock might end up in one as you grow. Here's what's out there: Equity ETFs track stock indices, like the S&P 500—maybe your shares join the party. Bond ETFs follow fixed-income stuff, less your speed. Commodity ETFs chase gold or oil prices, though coffee-bean ETFs aren't big yet. Sector ETFs zoom in on industries—imagine a ""bookstore and café"" sector with you in it. And Inverse/Leveraged ETFs? They're wild—betting against or juicing up an index's moves, not your usual cup of coffee. 

Notes: ETFs mix stock-like trading (on exchanges) with mutual fund vibes (pooled investments). Mutual funds can be exchange-traded, too, if they're closed-end. Indices? They're the silent engines behind ETFs, futures, and market chatter. Together, they signal your business isn't just a shop anymore—it's a contender. 

 5. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) 

You have come a long way. Your bookstore and lounge empire is now a powerhouse, growing steadily and flush with cash. You are itching to grow to rival the big chains around the country. But there are only so many shops you can open before you hit a wall— so you sit down to scout new opportunities. You start studying other successful chains, and one giant catches your eye: Howard Schultz's Starbucks. Digging into their business, you stumble across the ""Starbucks Effect""—neighbourhood property prices jump when a Starbucks pops up. Curious, you check your own locations. What do you know? Your shops are sparking the same magic. Dollar signs flash in your mind. You could snap up the real estate around your stores and ride that wave—but you don't want to tie up all the precious cash you've earned. So, you hatch a plan: pool some of your money with your investors' and launch a REIT—a Real Estate Investment Trust. Think of a REIT as a stock-like investment that owns a stake in properties or property-related assets. Here's what they look like: 

 - Equity REITs: These own and run income-producing real estate—think strip malls or buildings near your shops, renting out space for steady cash flow. 
 - Mortgage REITs: These focus on lending, investing in mortgages or mortgage- backed securities, earning from interest rather than rent. 
 - Hybrid REITs: A mix of both—owning properties and holding mortgages, blending the best of each world. 

Notes: REITs trade on exchanges like stocks, letting you dip ig into real estate without locking up all your funds. It's a way to grow your empire beyond books and coffee. 

As your bookstore and lounge empire grows, you might stumble across a few other financial tools—fancy stuff I won’t linger on too long. There’s Commodities, like trading gold, oil, or even coffee beans outright (usually through those futures we talked about) or tracking baskets of them via indices. Then there’s Forex, swapping currencies fast with spot trades, or betting on exchange rates with currency futures and options—handy if your coffee supplier’s overseas. And don’t forget Structured Products: things like asset- backed securities (bonds tied to loans), collateralized debt obligations (fancy loan bundles), or equity-linked notes (debt hitched to stock performance). They’re out there, mostly off-exchange, and might cross your path as you scale up—just don’t trip over them! 

Bonus - Depository Receipts 

Hopefully, I haven't lost all of you yet, and you don't feel like all this information is too overbearing. Moreover, I hope you don't fall under the false impression that all these different systems and platforms (that help make today's markets run) are just used to gatekeep it from you and complicate your life. Some of the instruments you can purchase are there to make buying what you are interested in more accessible (of course, a fee is assigned for this convenience). 

For this product, I want you to follow along with a simple thought experiment. For a moment, imagine you are living in a small town in the middle of Canada; you know only English, and your primary source of income is in Canadian dollars. You have become fascinated with buying stock in a South Korean and a Brazilian company. Generally, according to the respective countries' securities laws, you would need to be a resident or have a resident buy stock on your behalf. 

You, living in the middle of Canada, thousands of kilometres away from both Brazil and South Korea, don't know anyone there, can't speak Korean or Portuguese, and have no idea how even to transfer money and convert it to the respective local currencies (Korean won or Brazilian real). How could you possibly buy stock from those countries? Well, like in many things, you can give up and move on... however, you are determined and insist on doing it. Your other option is to hope that the company decides to also list in Canada (being sold in Toronto's stock exchange (TSE) in this case). However, lady luck doesn't shine on you, and that doesn't happen. So you save up, load up Google Translate, pack up your bags, get on a plane, fly, find a broker, try to convert your currency, register with the country, wait, in some cases months, to get approval and then work on reporting income and paying tax on profit in both Canada and South Korea or Brazil... but that's wildly impractical. Is there a better way? Could someone make it easier and help you out? 

Let's look back in history to find inspirations for possible solutions. Hundreds of years ago, as commerce was exploding across the continents, merchants could not carry gold or valuables to trade as they were too heavy or impractical. What ended up happening? They would find custodians (such as banks, merchants, governments, etc.) and get a receipt for the gold/valuables. Money was becoming a transaction medium of promise notes (meaning you would get paid a paper certificate or a claim on a trustee's gold reserves); the same idea can be used here for a depository receipt. 

Think of depository receipts as incorporating what we discussed about ETFs—a one-stock basket with a hedging tool (a tool used to convert your currency—Canadian dollars—to the local currency of where the stock is from) built in. Let's examine the main types: 

ADRs --- (American Depository Receipts) 

ADRs are the most common type of depository receipt, created in 1927 when the American market was looking for ways to invest in foreign companies without the complications of international trading. 

How they work:
 
 1. A U.S. bank (like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of New York Mellon) purchases shares of a foreign company 
 2. These shares are held in custody at a local branch or correspondent bank in the company's home country 
 3. The U.S. bank issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on American exchanges 
 4. The ADRs are priced in dollars and pay dividends in dollars 

Real-life scenario: Say you want to invest in Toyota. Instead of navigating the Tokyo Stock Exchange, you can simply buy Toyota's ADR (ticker: TM) on the New York Stock Exchange. When Toyota pays dividends in yen, the depositary bank converts them to dollars before sending them to ADR holders. One Toyota ADR might represent two actual Toyota shares, depending on how the bank structured the certificate. 

ADRs come in three levels, each with different requirements: 
 - Level I: Traded over-the-counter with minimal SEC reporting requirements 
 - Level II: Listed on major exchanges with more disclosure 
 - Level III: Allows the company to raise capital in the U.S. market with full SEC registration 

CDRs --- (Canadian Depository Receipts) 

CDRs are newer than ADRs, launched in 2021 by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). They follow a similar concept but with a key difference in how they handle currency fluctuations. 

How they work: 
 
 1. CIBC purchases shares of a foreign (often U.S.) company 
 2. These shares are held in custody 
 3. CIBC issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on Canadian exchanges 
 4. The CDRs are priced in Canadian dollars and pay dividends in Canadian dollars 
 5. But here is teh kicker Unlike ADRs, CDRs have a floating conversion ratio that changes daily based on exchange rates 

Real-life scenario: A Canadian investor interested in Apple doesn't want to deal with currency exchange rates or U.S. estate tax issues. Instead of buying Apple shares directly on the NASDAQ, they can purchase Apple CDRs (ticker: AAPL.NE) on the Neo Exchange in Toronto. 

The floating ratio is what makes CDRs unique. If Apple trades at $175 USD and the exchange rate is 1.35 CAD to 1 USD, CIBC might set the ratio so that one CDR represents 1/10 of an Apple share and trades at around $23.63 CAD ($175 × 1.35 ÷ 10). If the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar the next day, the ratio would automatically adjust to maintain the CDR's price in Canadian dollars. This means CDR holders are protected from currency fluctuations - a significant advantage over ADRs, where the conversion rate is fixed when the ADR is created. 

EDRs --- (European Depository Receipts) 

EDRs work similarly to ADRs but are for non-European companies looking to access European capital markets. 

How they work: 
 - A European bank purchases shares of a non-European company 
 - These shares are held in custody 
 - The bank issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on European exchanges 
 - The EDRs are typically priced in euros 

EDRs are less standardized than their American counterparts. While ADRs have been refined over nearly a century with clear SEC guidelines, EDRs operate under various European regulatory frameworks. Some key points about EDRs: 
 - They can be traded on multiple European exchanges simultaneously 
 - They typically follow a fixed ratio model similar to ADRs rather than the floating ratio of CDRs 
 - They're sometimes called Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) when they're designed to be traded on multiple international markets, not just European ones 
 - They often have lighter regulatory requirements than ADRs, making them attractive to companies from emerging markets like Russia and India 

Real-life scenario: A Russian energy company like Gazprom might issue EDRs traded on the London Stock Exchange. This gives European investors a way to invest in Gazprom through a familiar exchange, with transactions and dividends in euros or pounds rather than rubles. It also allows Gazprom to access European capital without having to meet the full listing requirements of European exchanges. So going back to our Canadian investor wanting to buy South Korean and Brazilian stocks depository receipts provide the solution. Instead of dealing with all those barriers, you can simply buy the ADRs, CDRs, or EDRs (depending on what's available) through your local broker, using your Canadian dollars, filing only Canadian taxes, and sleeping well at night knowing you've diversified globally without all the headaches.

House mate keeps rearranging dishwasher after it has already been stacked.,"I’d like to start by saying I am a clean person and particular about keeping the house clean (I don’t expect anyone else to have the exact same standards) however, every time my house mate comes home from work in the evenings, even if the dishwasher has already had dishes put in it. I usually put the coffee mugs in the specific slots designed for handles, it is not out of control that they must go there but the fact that putting them in the slots they are designed for stops them from moving around in the dishwasher and prevents the ceramic from chipping.

I’ll be getting my work clothes ready for the next morning and I can hear clinking and clanging in the kitchen, it’s my house mate. Every night without fail, after dinner will rummage through the dishwasher and move all of the glasses and the coffee mugs into the corners of the dishwasher. I have confronted him and asked him during the flow of general conversation in the kitchen and his response was “I didn’t, I was putting away my dishes” so I then said “that’s interesting because the ones I put in the dishwasher earlier have moved”. He said nothing. 

I can’t help but laugh because I saw him move it all and it’s a very minor inconvenience, but then trying to act like he didn’t do it is strange to me. 

It got so annoying hearing the constant noise every night and from his previous side stepping, I knew he wouldn’t admit to it if I asked a second time so I would peek around the corner when I could hear him doing it so I could then remind him of what the slots in the dishwasher are made for and why I put them there. His reply was “you can fit more in there when you move them”

I can’t help but laugh because I know how minor of an inconvenience it is, but this isn’t the only thing he does. I will clean the house every morning so it’s fresh for the day and ten minutes later I will walk back through an area I have just made nice and he will have opened a drawer ever so slightly, pulled a towel halfway off the towel rail or gone through the kitchen cupboards to move which way the toaster faces and even flips around the cushions on the couch to be facing the wrong way. 

I have approached him multiple times about the situation as coffee mugs keep getting chipped and I keep replacing them with more that get chipped again. He stops doing it for a couple of days but then the cycle continues. 

Am I the asshole if I approach him about this again or should I just let it go and keep replacing the chipped, cracked coffee mugs?",3,1745651321.0,AmItheAsshole,11,1.0,False

This trip report is mostly for myself, but maybe someone might learn from my mistakes as I try to from other people’s trip reports.

I loved Japan, and even spending nearly 3 weeks there I felt I missed out on so much. In reflection, much of that was because of my over-planning at the beginning of the trip, and then the very real experience of doing all those steps!  I ended up booking our next lot of flights a month after returning, haha. 

**Day 1: 29/01 Arrival in Narita**

Original Plan

* Arrive, catch free bus to hotel (Narita Tobu Airport Hotel), repack bags so we could forward our luggage and just keep the hand luggage, organise sending our luggage, pick up Ghibli tickets & WiFi device from hotel

What Happened

* Pretty much happened as planned, Narita airport was easy enough to navigate once we got our bearings. We filled in the immigration card when we got there (tried to do the QR thing, paper was just easier). Also, our first experience of Japan’s Winter cold. Activated esim from Airalo.
* First aid: only upset was that I ripped a nail off before leaving Brisbane. Was lucky that the hotel had a mini-drugstore on site open late so I picked up some antiseptic cream,finger bandages and nail clippers. Nail clippers were amazing, I clipped off the fake nail so it wouldn’t keep catching on things, sprayed antiseptic and bandaged Stumpy up. Also, our first experience of Japan’s Winter cold. 
* Steps: 9,058

**Day 2: 30/01 Narita > Miyajima (big travel day)**

Original Plan

* Shuttle to Narita, catch NEX to Shinagawa, shinkansen to Shin-Osaka, pick up JR passes at Shin-Osaka, shinkansen to Hiroshima, catch ferry to Miyajima, check-in to Ryokan (Miyajima Seaside Hotel) & ride ropeway up Mt Misen if there early enough

What Happened

* Narita - H:11° L:-2°/ Miyajima - H:7° L:4°
* Travel: Overall, went to plan. I added a digital suica to my apple wallet, bsf got a physical suica. Bought our first konbini snacks and vending machine hot drinks (also tried my first drip coffee & hated it). The NEX was meant to take around 45-60 minutes to get to Shinagawa, but there was a delay so it took about 2.5 hours which was not great for our tight schedule. Got to Shin-Osaka, picked up our passes and then reserved seats for Hiroshima. Got to Miyajima Island and the first thing I saw was that the ropeway was closed for maintenance (note: this will be a recurring theme) so that axed that plan. 
* Miyajima Hotel: They shuttled us from the port and we settled in for a traditional kaiseki dinner, which was really fun and interesting, then they turned down our futons and we turned in. View was lovely.
* Steps: 7,893

**Day 3: 31/01 Miyajima > Fukuoka**

Original Plan

* Morning: Breakfast at hotel, ropeway up Mt Misen (if not done the previous day), explore some of the island
* Afternoon: Explore Hiroshima & the memorials
* Evening: Shinkansen to Hakata & check-in to hostel (Fukuoka Hana Hostel)

What Happened

* Miyajima - H:10° L:4°
* I got up to have my first onsen experience at 6am and it was lovely. Traditional breakfast before we went to explore.
* The Island: Beautiful, clean and calm. There were deer and ducks everywhere. We were freezing our bits off so got hot drinks, explored the temple and tried to get our energy up. We passed through Itsukushima Shrine and ended up walking down to the aquarium. We were just in time for the Sea Lion & Seal show, it was super cute! Tried our first claw machine and failed. Stopped for some hand warmers at 7-11 and had to stop the deer from eating our bags. 
* Travelling to Fukuoka: We had no time to explore Hiroshima in the end, just time to get our bags from the hotel, travel back to Hiroshima and then catch the next shinkansen to Hakata. We got to explore Hiroshima station surroundings for a bit though.
* Checked into the hostel and sought out the famous streets of yatai for dinner. Not sure if it’s just because of the cold, but there was only like 3 stalls open. We stopped at the first one as they ushered us in, and had a really nice few bites to eat. 
* Checked out Minotaur (fashion) and our first Don Quijote. Super tired so we didn’t stay out much longer.
* Steps: 23,672

**Day 4: 01/02 Day Trip - Yufuin**

Original Plan

* Yufuin no Mori (booked tickets) to Yufuin, explore, visit a friend in Beppu, maybe see Seven Hells if time 

What Happened

* Fukuoka - H:11° L:5° / Yufuin - H:10° L:6° + so much rain
* High stress this morning as we had to get to Hakata Station and pick up our Yufuin no Mori tickets before we could board. The station was SUPER busy and I genuinely thought we’d miss it, but we got through the line just in time. Turns out the Yufuin no Mori had some sort of maintenance so they substituted it with another train - was very sad, but what can you do.
* It rained all day, but I bought an umbrella back in Fukuoka. Took a walk through the ghibli-esque village but felt no desire to do much shopping, so we went to the Snoopy Cafe for a dry reprieve. Bsf got the curry, I got a dessert, we tried the coffee again and did not like it lol, but we were dry and the food was good. Bsf picked up a Tanto themed umbrella, then we went on our soggy way to Beppu.
* Met up with the friend as planned but didn’t leave the station. It was already late, we were cold and damp, so bought a couple of things from the stores there then trained back to Hakata.
* Steps: 15,546

**Day 5: 02/02 Fukuoka > Kyoto**

Original Plan

* Check out teamLab Forest, visit some parks, shopping at Canal City, Shinkansen to Kyoto, check in to hotel (Sotetsu Fresa Inn Kyoto-Hachijoguchi)

What Happened

* Fukuoka - H:12° L:6° / Kyoto - H:11° L:5°
* First experience catching a bus in Japan, which was exciting! Glade that bothe maps seemed to work well enough. teamLab Forest was interesting, and after a stop at Starbucks we explored Canal City and were blown away by its size. I think we only went to 2 wings? Visited the Doc’s store, Jump Shop and a couple of other places. Regrettably didn’t visit any parks.
* Eventually caught the shinkansen to Kyoto and checked into our next hotel. There was a Family mart right on the corner which we got many a breakfast at.
* Steps: 16,056

**Day 6: 03/02 Kyoto Day Trip - Uji & Kyoto West**

Original Plan

* Start in Uji - Nintendo Museum & exploring
* Kyoto West - Book a Miko experience,  visit Toei Studios, visit Macho Bar

What Happened

* Kyoto - H:11° L:4°
* Most of that stuff didn’t happen. Decided to try the hotel’s breakfast which was buffet style mix of western and traditional. I got a Nintendo Museum booking for 4pm so in the morning we visited Kyoto Takashimaya Shopping Center for Nintendo (bought an AC pouch & booklet), Mandarake and had lunch. Saw some interesting construction practices and cute florists. We then visited the Minotaur store nearby and bsf bought a cool hoodie before heading to Uji. I also think this is the first time we saw some cherry blossoms!
* We got there a little before our session time so went to find something matcha-related. We visited TEA SQUARE MORIHAN Kura Cafe and everything was delicious but SO rich. 
* Nintendo Museum - we had fun, but it was crowded by now. We played with a giant controller and a couple of other games (cafe was closed by the time we finished) before heading back and getting sushi for dinner at the Aeon Mall just outside the station. I didn’t realise we could get our Mii’s on our tickets, that would have been a great little souvenir!
* Steps: 21,757

**Day 7: 04/02 Kyoto Day Trip - Kobe**

Original Plan

* Kewpie Mayo Tour in morning, visit Nunobiki Herb Gardens are for lunch, visit Mosaic ferris wheel
* Dinner reservation at Tor Road Steak Aoyama (7pm)

What Happened

* Kyoto - H:6° L:0°/ Kobe - H:4° L:-2° (FL -7° when snow began)
* Instead of it being a 2 hour trip to Kobe, we managed to get a super express and were there in like 15 minutes so our Kobe exploring started super early. Went to get on the ropeway - closed for maintenance. So no herb garden for us, and we didn’t have our dinner reservation until 7pm. 
* Feeling pretty rundown and miserable today (it was also the coldest day yet, -7 degrees) we didn’t want to go far. We ended up getting crepes at HAHAHA CREPES, then heading to Kobe Harborland mostly to wander for a few hours. I got on the giant ferris wheel, we got some hot drinks and just tried to relax. Ferris Wheel attendant called my Animal Crossing pouch kawaii. 
* It snowed! My first time seeing snow, and it was kinda magical and whimsical. Noticed a significant temp drop right before all the flakes started drifting down.
* Tor Road Steak Aoyama: Our splurge dinner. It was amazing. I booked this about 3 months in advance via facebook. It was delicious, and Chef Shuhei was very entertaining. An intimate dinner with just us and one other group of three. I mistook Shochu for Shoju, which I should have clued in when they asked how I wanted it (soda/straight/water) but I am dumb and asked for it straight. Boy did it just taste like lighter fluid. Didn’t make that mistake again. ¥24,900 for our dinner, drinks and dessert. 
* Steps: 19,335

**Day 8: 05/02 Kyoto Day Trip - Nara & Osaka**

Original Plan

* Explore Osaka - Umeda, Namba + Donki ferris wheel, visit Kaiyukan Aquarium + ferris wheel + Mt Tenpo, maybe check out Osaka bars, then possibly visit Nara if daytime left (wasn’t too interested in the Deer Park)

What Happened

* Kyoto - H:5° L:-2° / Nara - H:5° L:-2° / Osaka - H:5° L:0°
* Changed up plans and decided to visit Nara & Todai-ji temple first. It was beautiful and I’m glad we went. There were deer everywhere, despite the cold it was a sunny day, and then as we were leaving it snowed again! It was 3 degrees, said it felt like -8 degrees which seemed more accurate but it wasn’t as cold as Kobe. Maybe because it wasn’t as windy.
* Visited a Book-Off in Osaka-Namba to check it out, did a bit of window shopping, visited America-mura and actually found this cool alternative clothing store (DIVINER OSAKA) but they only stocked size M and up, so bsf was sad they couldn’t buy what they wanted. 
* Started snowing again briefly and we walked back to Dotonbori, then eventually found lunch at Ramen Zundouya and some strawberry tanghulu. Donki ferris wheel was closed for maintenance.
* Made our way to Kaiyukan Aquarium and by this time it was freezing, darkening, the wind had picked up that we were actively fighting it in some streets that I gave up on Mt Tenpo. Ferris wheel was closed for maintenance but I doubt they would run anyway in the wind. The aquarium was wonderful, I bought a little stamp book and the whale sharks were beautiful. The gift shop here had less variety of merch than the one in Miyajima, which was a surprise. Made our way back to Kyoto and finally tried Japan Macca’s. Interestingly different, and less greasy for sure. 
* Steps: 21,032



**Day 9: 06/02 Kyoto > Nagoya**

Original Plan

* Fushimi Inari, rent bikes to see more shrines, check out Gion district, possibly book a tea experience 
* Forward large luggage on to Tokyo, Shinkansen to Nagoya and check-in to hotel (9h nine hours)

What Happened

* Kyoto - H:5° L:-3° / Nagoya - H:6° L:0°
* We did not do any of these sightseeing things, lol. We were exhausted. We checked out of the hotel and mostly just wandered around. Outside of Kyoto station’s main entrance there were a bunch of school children asking us questions for a school project, then they had a laminated sheet of suggestions. It was really cute, and when we mentioned we wanted to see some One Piece stores they got super excited and told us their favourite characters. Had lunch at Shabu Shabu Tajimaya in the Aeon Mall, then checked out some more stores and the Square Enix pop up store. 
* Caught the shinkansen to Nagoya, checked in to the 9h capsule hotel and retraced our steps to the JR Gate Tower to explore BIC Camera. My feet needed a rest so eventually I just sat and waited for bsf to finish their shopping - they bought new earphones. 
* Steps: 16,759

**Day 10: 07/02 Nagoya (Ghibli Museum) > Hakone (big travel day)**



Original Plan

* Drop luggage at Nagoya station, visit Ghibli Museum, back to Nagoya station, shinkansen to Odawara and use Hakone Freepass for local trains to hotel (Emblem Flow Hakone)

What Happened

* Nagoya - H:7° L:2° / Hakone - H:8° L:3°
* Ghibli day! Dropped carry-on, made our way to Aichi park. I was worried it would be difficult to find but it was fine, signage was great. Another cold, snowy day so it was extra whimsical. We went to Valley of The Witches first, rode the rides, and Howl’s Moving Castle was so beautiful. I wish we could take photos inside. Went to the Grand Warehouse at 11am and it was even busier. The theatre played a super cute film called A Wrestler’s Tail, and we braved the giftshop and bought too much. Lunch at Flying Oven, some more purchases at Witches Coven 13 (no size in the shirt I wanted to buy 🙁) and then a quick trip to the rest of the areas. We wrapped up around closing time anyway and made our way back.
* On our way to Hakone I realised that I miscalculated our transport & transfer times, and that we wouldn’t be getting to our hotel until after 11pm, which thankfully they just left us a key at reception. I really, really enjoyed this hotel and I wish we’d stayed another night. The bedding was great, facilities felt pretty modern and had a nice vibe. 
* Steps: 17,499

**Day 11: 08/02 Hakone > Tokyo Shinjuku**

Original Plan

* Drop luggage at Gora station, complete the Hakone loop (ropeway + pirate ship), visit Hakone Shrine and return, Shinjuku Romancecar to Tokyo and check in to hotel (9h nine hours) in Shinjuku

What Happened

* Hakone - H:8° L:2° / Tokyo- H:9° L:1°
* As above. Had another 6am onsen dip except I fell over in this one. Water was milky white and I missed the step (rip) so had a scrape on my leg which ached in the cold. Dropped our carry-on and headed up. Sounzan station had a wonderful viewpoint with a footbath, and a giftshop. Made note to buy some things on the way back.
* Owakudani to Togendai ropeway was closed for maintenance so we got on a bus instead, where we then caught a pirate ship over to Motohakone-ko. Visited the konbini for snacks and hot drinks, then walked to Hakone shrine - also closed. Still enjoyed the walk and came back, returned to Togendai via pirate ship and the bus back to Owakudani. There was a heap of traffic and took us ages, so lucky our romancecar ticket was for later in the day. 
* We thought the Owakudani Kurotamagokan was displaying signs for a Black Curry lunch, but it was actually only the diy packets for ramen. Went back to Sounzan station and while bsf used the footbath, I revisited the giftshop. So many strawberry scented things! Also some sakura-flavoured fairy floss, and a nice warm kumopan to share on the way down.
* Made all the transfers to eventually catch the Romancecar into Shinjuku. Checked into our next capsule hotel, then decided to get konbini dinner and crash. Some tourists loudly rolled their suitcases into the capsule floor at like 1am and wore their shoes in. 
* Steps: 14,076

**Day 12: 09/02 Shinjuku > Asakusa**

Original Plan

* Explore a bit of Shinjuku, then head to Asakusa and check in to final hotel (APA Kaminarimon Minami) and explore Asakusa

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:11° L:1°
* I don’t know what it was about Shinjuku, but this morning was aggravating. Maybe it was just us. We wanted to find the station we’d eventually leave from to Asakusa, and maps was just confusing and we were hangry by the time we actually found the entrance and nearest coin lockers. I thought people were exaggerating about Shinjuku’s stations but they were not. Walked for a bit and eventually had lunch at Le Salon De Nina’s - it was the first restaurant so far we had to use the pedestal to get a ticket, and some girls already waiting helped us use it when they saw us sit down to wait instead of using it.
* Visited Tower Records, bought some things. There was some in store pop idol performance so it was loud and crowded. Got some matcha lattes at Gap Vintage  before finally heading to Asakusa to check into the last hotel of the trip.
* Decided to check out Harajuku, specifically to see the CTCTYO store in the Laforet building. We also discovered Ai to Kyouki no Market. Lots of different artists, and one cube in particular just had some exquisite jewellery. CTCYO and this market became our favourite stores of the trip. 
* Saw a Lush store nearby. We have Lush in Australia but it was fun to see the difference in product ranges and the staff were so friendly. We met a couple there (one who was in full lolita) and had a lovely chat.
* Steps: 15,005

**Day 13: 10/02 Ghibli Museum**

Original Plan

* Visit Ghibli Museum (10am) and explore local area

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:11° L:0°
* The Ghibli Museum was lovely. Had lunch at the museum which was kind of eh, and the giftshop was jam packed. The film they showed was Mei and the Kittenbus.
* Caught the bus back to Musashino and did some exploring. Bought a pouch and some gacha from Kuusoogai Zakkaten (stationery store), then planned on visiting Kichijoji Petit Mura but somehow ended up in the Tea Stand, so just got a drink there instead. 
* Visited CTCYO again because bsf was getting fomo about items we’d seen previously. Dinner was at a restaurant close to our hotel that we saw a line outside every night - Asakusa Gyukatsu. We waited for over an hour in the cold (and had to listen to tourists complain about the wait - like ok? find somewhere else then) and it was delicious. We felt compelled to eat quickly because of how busy it was, but still amazing.
* Steps: 11,902

**Day 14: 11/02 Yokohama**   


Original Plan

* Visit Yokohama Strawberry Festival & Cup Noodle Factory

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:10° L:1° / Yokohama - H:10° L:2°
* Another super tired day - we went to the Yokohama Strawberry Festival and I was surprised it was a small indoors event. It was of course packed, so really we just got some delicious desserts, some daifuku and gtfo.
* Decided to axe the Cup Noodle Factory and visit Nakano Broadway instead. So much to see! I got some One Piece merch, and could have easily spent more time there. Had dinner at Asakusa Umaimon Aduma, and it was delicious.
* Steps: 10,948

**Day 15: 12/02 Day Trip - Disneyland**

Original Plan

* Visit Disneyland

What Happened

* Tokyo Weather - H:13° L:2°
* Visited Disneyland! My first time ever. It was chill, but very busy. During the day I actually got a little sunburnt on my ears, but at night it was super cold and windy so they cancelled the fireworks. We tried the turkey leg, some other bits, and they were all fine. Went on as many rides as the day allowed, but Beauty and The Beast was my favourite. Was a little stressed booking things with the app but it worked out fine.
* The giftshop at the entrance of the park was wild. I’ve never been to Disneyland so I really wanted a pair of ears - bsf and I got separated practically immediately, and this was the first time I actually got anxious about a crowd. I dread to think what another country’s Disneyland is like. Thankfully, it was calmer in the evening. 
* Lost & Found: Lost my bank card somewhere around 5:30pm, realised within the next hour when I went to use it. I for sure thought it was goners, but I went to L&F and it was there. I told them where I thought I’d lost it (between Pooh’s Hunny Hunt at 4:30ish, then the Castle about 5:30ish), what was on it, and sure enough it was there. The two people in front of me lost their phone and it was there, and a set of ears and *they* were there. Wild but wonderful. 
* Steps: 23,445

**Day 16: 13/02 Akihabara** 

Original Plan

* Explore Akihabara, lunch reservation at Eorzea Cafe (1pm)

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:13° L:4°
* Explored Akihabara, visited some second hand stores and got some doujinshi and trinkets, got lost on the way to Eorzea cafe (maps did something weird) so we got a nice jog in before lunch. Eorzea had some nice lunch items and was very cutely themed. We weren’t ready to head back yet so continued exploring and found the Final Fantasy Cafe & giftshop to look through. 
* Visited Yodobashi Akiba 
* With no actual plan for the afternoon, I finally sat down to figure out what the hell I was going to do about Stumpy. I’m used to salons taking walk-ins back home, but it didn’t seem to work like that. Just outside the station was a Nail Quick atré and managed to get an appointment online for that afternoon. The tech did such a fantastic job. Was literally so relieved and Kaneko was so very patient with me and my questions. Felt nice to have the claws off.
* Steps: 11,650

**Day 17: 14/02 Day Trip - DisneySea**

Original Plan

* Visit DisneySea 

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:12° L:3°
* Visited DisneySea! This park had a much chiller vibe compared to Disneyland, and we finally tried some of the flavoured popcorn. They were sold out of the Small World popcorn buckets so got a Tangled one instead. It was another beautiful but windy day, so they were closing the park early at 6:30pm. I managed to get the Tangled ride. Indiana Jones and the Haunted Mansion were super fun, and Aquatopia we managed to fit in right before close. We were late to our lunch booking at Restaurant Sakura, and I apologised profusely and tried to convey that if there were no spots left we understood but they ushered us in anyway and told us to try and be on time. Could not apologise enough! No fireworks again, which was really my only major disappointment. 
* Steps: 23,925

**Day 18: 15/02 Harajuku + Ginza** 

Original Plan

* Explore Harajuku, then explore Ginza & dinner res at the Vampire Cafe (7:30pm)

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:13° L:6°
* Starbucks visit this morning (like most mornings), but this time they had put out the cherry blossom themed goods! Had a strawberry & sakura soy latte.
* Visited Takeshita St in Harajuku and was underwhelmed. It was crowded and I was hoping to see some great alternative fashion but it was eh. Saw some cool trinkets, OP jackets, and a couple of cool stores we checked out but nothing inherently ‘alternative’ beside like ACDC Rag etc. Definitely some cutesy stores though. 
* Decided to go to Sunshine City to check out the Mugiwara store and Donguri Republic. There was a convention at the same time so there were a bunch of cosplayers. Got my first and only gacha of the trip - a plastic tamagotchi ring. Had a nice lunch here then went back to the hotel.
* Ventured out for our dinner res at The Vampire Cafe in Ginza. It was a fun time, although a one-and-done thing. Food was nice enough and themed on point. ¥21,300 for dinner for two and a few drinks.
* Steps: 15,453

**Day 19: 16/02 Tokyo Flea Market + Tokyo Tower**

Original Plan

* Visit Oi Racecourse Markets, then see Tokyo Tower

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:16° L:8°
* Visited the flea market in hopes of finding some cool trinkets and some fashion items. The fashion didn’t speak to me, except one lady with a gorgeous pink car but when I got closer the style didn’t suit me. But I enjoyed combing through stuff and I got some cute chopstick holders, and bsf got some cool glasses. One of the vendors gave me an old coin as a gift after I bought from him. I overheard another tourist complaining to a shop owner about the conversion fee if she paid by card, and that the shop owner should discount the item because of it… could only roll our eyes at that. 
* Tokyo Tower was crowded but cool to look at. We got lunch in the food court and did some shopping, but it was such a grey day we didn’t go up but took a walk around outside instead. We decided to visit Tokyo Skytree for our evening activity, and got sucked into Tokyo Solamachi beforehand. We’d seen MyFragrance in Kyoto already but decided to make our own fragrance which was fun. Then we went up the tower and spent some viewing time up there, but it was so crowded so we bailed pretty soon after. 
* Went for a walk around Asakusa, and we ended up in Donki for a little look around. Didn’t buy much but I knew I’d be back. Watched a guy in a panda suit wander around and play guitar.
* Steps: 19,087

**Day 20: 17/02 Day Trip - Kamakura & Enoshima Island**

Original Plan

* Visit Hokoku-ji Temple and drink the tea, explore Kamakura, make a ring at Glanta and visit Oxymoron for curry, then visit Enoshima Island for the winter illumination

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:14° L:4° / Kamakura - H:12° L:2° / Enoshima - H:14° L:4° (+ lots of wind, felt way colder than Kamakura)
* Pretty much on par with what we planned. Hokoku-ji was beautiful, and we bought a ticket for the Tea House. I was not strong enough for the drink, and even the sweets didn’t help, but I soldiered on. It was peaceful and tranquil. 
* We went back to Kamakura at this point for some shopping but also checked out Hataage Benzaiten Shrine, which was surrounded by pigeons, ducks, seagulls and catfish. It was such a lovely surprise! We got love fortunes there. Oxymoron for lunch, and then we wandered Komachi-dori St. Found a lovely second-hand kimono shop (Kitano-ya) that bsf bought some hakama from. Decided to skip the Glanta workshop.
* The train to Enoshima was a lovely view. At some point an obaa-chan boarded the train and I offered her my seat. When she got off the train she handed us a box of two packaged cupcakes and thanked us. We got a sunset view of Mt Fuji on the way over to the island.
* The Winter Illuminations were pretty and we had probably the best seafood wafer snack there that we wish we’d eaten more of. Spent a few hours here looking at the illuminations and some cherry blossom trees before finally calling it (too cold and too dark) and making our way back to Asakusa. Lots of drunk tourists on the island when we left, surprisingly. 
* Steps: 16,349

**Day 21: 18/02 Shopping & Souvenirs**

Original Plan

* Hit any last shops for souvenirs etc, pack

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:8° L:2°
* Day: Hit up Starbucks for some sakura themed coffee beans and mugs to take home, then into Harajuku. Tried to find the Mugiwara Store which google said was open, but the Tokyu Plaza Harajuku entrance was closed for maintenance. We gave up and went to Shibuya Parco first to check out the Jump shop, Pokemon store and Nintendo store (in which I spent lots of money on AC things). Had yakiniku for lunch at KINTAN which was fantastic. Then down the street to Hands (also bought many things, mainly stamps). It snowed briefly when we exited. La Foret was open by now so we made our way back there to check out our favourite stores, then back to Lush. Finally we backtracked to Miyashita Park to visit another Minotaur and check out shops.
* Evening: We had shabu shabu at Kobe Beef Daia, and it was such a lovely dinner. They gave us strawberries for dessert on the house, and helped us make origami to stick on the walls. It was an amazing dinner for our last night.
* My night: I braved Donki while bsf went back to the hotel. I was determined to get a bunch of things, so at about 10pm I ventured forth. I spent about an hour looking through different products, translating etc and selecting. Then I lined up for the tax free line and waited for **2 hours** like an idiot with the line barely moving - it was insane. In the end I remembered I have free will and who gives a crap about tax free at this point, so went down a level to the normal checkout where I learned that all of the medicated items I wanted can only be purchased on the previous floor - which was the tax free line. There was no-one manning the medication only counter and no separate lines for non-tax free, so gave up and only purchased the non-medicated stuff. Went back to the hotel and packed.
* Steps: 19,372

**Day 22: 19/02 Last day :(**

Original Plan

* Use hotels transport partner to send our luggage ahead to Narita, get breakfast, then enjoy a few more hours of last-minute shopping

What Happened

* Tokyo - H:8° L:1°
* I bought extra weight for Qantas due to my souvenirs. It was way expensive, so if this were to happen again I’d probably just post stuff home. APA used Airporter which I thought seemed a tad more expensive, but they did allow us to send our luggage same-day to Narita airport which we did. We had a later flight so this helped.
* We had breakfast at COFFEE KAN Asakusa, which was fine. The toast and pancakes were amazing, I only wish the boiled egg I got was warm. Also took some photos outside of the Bandai HO Building. 
* We (me, running off fumes) made our way back to Harajuku for one last look at Laforet and Lush (which turned out great because they had a stock refresh), and tried to find the cute Mugiwara store. Turns out we were looking in the wrong place - Tokyu Plaza Harajuku (which was closed the day before) was different from Tokyu Plaza Omotesando, where the store actually was, duh. We finally found it. 
* Lastly we returned to Akihabara, for a good ol’ nostalgic meal for bsf at Marusho, located in Yodobashi Akiba. Japan Eats actually did a video on this place in Jan, but bsf remembered eating at this place about 10 years ago. It’s changed a bit, but the ramen was still super salty and great. I visited a nearby chemist and picked up all those medicated goods I couldn’t get at Donki the night before.
* It was back to Narita airport by train after that, then the usual process of heading home. The guy at the JAL desk that had our luggage was pretty rude, the only rude person we’d really experienced on the trip. I put my tax-free items in my checked baggage, and just had my passport scanned but they never asked to check it.
* Steps: 17,981



Thoughts:

* Hotels (& other buildings):
   * Temp: Inside buildings really are much warmer inside. I was constantly taking my jumper off, and at night I would sweat my ass off until I acclimated again.
   * My power bank would never charge to full overnight, but it did enough.
   * Some hotels had pyjamas in a OSFA, as a size AU 16-18 I found them uncomfortable to wear. The hotel yukata were fine.
   * TV - we really enjoyed just flicking through channels and watching random programmes and ads when we had our downtime.
* Language - I tried to speak as much Japanese as I could. It was fun, people seemed to understand (or try to) and were so kind and helpful. I do not speak Japanese, I was just doing my best with phrases and context.
* Shoes - I took a pair of Hokas (bought specifically for the trip, not broken in), Reeboks, and some black boots. I wore the Hokas the most, and having another 2 pairs to switch between was great. Bsf is a chunky boots person and lived in them. 
* Clothes - I’m always cold, so I wore fleece thermal lining, my regular clothes, then a puffer most days. On the sunnier days I wore a thinner thermal but still had a puffer jacket. 
* No Pepsi Max anywhere we went :( Coca Cola is king
* Souvenirs - I regret not buying what I wanted in Kyoto and waiting to see what Tokyo had, like from the Nintendo Store. Tokyo was sold out of some of the things I wanted. Also, a lot of stores had city-specific stock.
* Money - I used the digital suica majority of the time (apple wallet, used my UP card to top it up via Apple Pay), and only a few transactions in cash. My UP card had no international conversion fees which was good. Bsf used mostly cash as their BOQ bank card worked only a fraction of the time we were there.
* Data/Power: I was going through at least one charge a day as I was doing majority of the mapping, translating and photo taking. You don’t really need more than one power bank imo. ESim worked fine, so did the Wifi device, and there was also a lot of free wifi around. 



Things I’ll do differently next time:

* Plan out which historical and cultural places to visit instead of winging it. We ended up missing a lot because we were more focused on shopping spots. Also, visit more parks.
* More social/nightlife activities. I was craving more social interaction (outside of my dearest travelling companion) and I think that really affected my mood too. On the flipside, bsf is highly introverted so the lack of small talk was great for them.
* Explore more of the local streets. We stayed in Asakusa for like 10 nights and never even visited Senso-ji temple because it was closed by the time we got back from our days, and just way too many tourists when we would pass it in the mornings. Then it was the end of the trip.
* Spend more than 1 night & day in places so we don’t feel rushed.
* Take less - I was worried about many things so overpacked on thermals, and took 3 power banks - definitely didn’t need as much as I took.
* Just send stuff home via post if necessary. Way cheaper.
* Not jam-pack my backpack for everyday adventures. If I need something, I can buy it while I’m out.
* Shinkansen: For all the shinkansen reservations we had station staff book them (especially with multiple legs and using our passes), but for all the local trains etc we booked them ourselves or used our suica cards.
* Just book a flight in the city you want to start in. The extra money is worth it not to lose half a day to a full day in travel.



Thanks for reading if you did! It was still a great trip but I would do things differently if I could rewind. Next trip is in Autumn and it will be much more relaxed, and I have a bigger bucket list now for future trips. Maybe even a road trip eventually. 😊",3,1745650930.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False

I researched and looked into a few supplements and ordered inositol and L-carnitine, but the most significant change my made was simply in my diet (which everyone says). I haven’t restricted anything but the things I’ve drastically cut down on my consumption of Added sugar, coffee (not caffeine), and Dairy, (specifically cows milk I still have cream and cheese), and processed snacks like crisps-I also never cut down on carbs and made protein a priority. Regular low-impact strength training  also played a huge role, I made it a goal to workout 3x a week since I’m not an athlete anymore plus my NP also said my metabolism is way too low for my age. Once i got my supplements I went straight to taking them. Big mistake. Inositol gave me the worst heartburn and acid reflux I’ve ever had, so I stopped taking it after a week, L-carnitine is fine though and I take it when I remember to. On top of gaining muscle and losing fat with PCOS, I got my period back, once right after the diagnosis and recently on the predicted day! I know it’s different from everyone and hundreds of people have probably tried this, but I just wanted to share what worked for me. 
Basically my key advice is to: 
-have a balance of food-  focus on nourishing your body but your mind as well
-move your body-walking/pilates/weights, anything that works for you and won’t strain your body 
-listen to your body-if you feel like you’re not eating enough eat more, if you feel like you’re exhausted from working out, take a rest day.",2,1745650627.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False
1k86vhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryPolitics/comments/1k86vhf/community_intelligent_democracy_cid_general/,Community Intelligent Democracy (C.I.D) General Information,"Political Structure:
• The system places political participants under the people. The people’s assembly can question the real government at any time and even dismiss them completely.
• The ""shadow"" government, which represents the people, monitors the real government on the same level.

Government Formation:
• The real/IQ government is made up of the most intelligent individuals.
• The ""shadow"" government can hold the real government accountable at any time.

Operation:
• Every two years, IQ tests are held, and the following criteria must be met:

No criminal background.

Must be at least 16 years old.

Mentally stable (calm, without emotional outbursts if their ideas are rejected).

Free from any dependencies (coffee does not count).

Must have citizenship.

Must demonstrate creativity.
• The top 25 individuals who perform best in these tests are selected. The test is completed online and organized by the people’s government. The selected individuals form the real/IQ government. They present well-thought-out ideas to the ""shadow"" government, which then votes on them.
• Each county contributes three representatives to the people's government, who oversee the operations of the real government. If a proposal is presented, the people’s government votes on it. If rejected, the reason must be justified (e.g., too expensive, unnecessary) and returned to the real government for further refinement. If approved by a 2/3 majority, the people’s council is responsible for implementing it, as they are the experts.


State of Emergency:
• In the event of war, an environmental disaster, or an economic crisis, the People’s Council can declare a state of emergency. During this period, decisions made by the real government do not require the approval of the People’s Council but can only be made regarding matters directly related to the emergency. The end of the state of emergency can only be declared by the People’s Council.",1,1745650466.0,ImaginaryPolitics,0,1.0,False

• How old are you? What's your gender?

I’m 17 and I’m Demigirl 🔥

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

Not that I know of. So no!

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I had a little bit, I went to daycare at a church and learned all about it when I was 4 or 5, but it wasn’t ever forced onto me. Neither of my parents are very religious so I’m free from anything. (Agnostic)

• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I don’t have a job currently yet, but if I were to have one I’d be store/shop related. Like a coffee shop or boba shop, and a big big store where I can walk around if I’m bored and I like restocking and organizing things. Plus I’d work somewhere like Ulta or Sephora because of the makeup and skincare products, I am very interested in those types of things.

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I would feel very lonely, if it’s one of those times where I’m very bored and need stimulation it would be like torture. The weekend is the only time I feel free to do what I want and go shopping and chill without being forced to sit in class for 8 hours!

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

When I was younger I’d definitely say more solitude quiet activities like drawing , anything where I could stay inside. And I don’t disagree with that idea, but I’d definitely prefer being able to be WITH people. I like talking, or even listening to people talk. It’s boring without some sort of socializing, even though yes I am socially awkward and anxious. I like art, music and I really like soaps and fragrances right now so shopping and going out have been my favorite things to do.

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I’m not TOO curious, I think. At least nothing philosophical or out worldly, I only care about what’s possible in this world and time. The only times I’m curious and nosy in people’s business is if they’re talking about me, or someone I hate. I don’t want to get myself carried away with ideas and stuff because it’s too much stress for something literally not happening. I like to improvise more, I hate planning and setting limits for myself. I’m NOT philosophical or curious about anything that matters.

• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I don’t like taking on leadership positions… it’s too much pressure honestly. I like when situations are more out of my control and even a little chaotic, as long as I’m not hurt ofc. If I were a leader, I’d be more laid back about it because I hate strict rules and guidelines. Whatever I don’t like, I’ll address accordingly but it’s never that serious.

• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I do like working with my hands, following the next question…

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I AM artistic! I love art and expression like that. I like physical art way more than poetry or any other forms of art. Art I can sense, hear, see, feel is better than anything else. I lowkey hate poetry and art that’s not easy to understand like that, I like making art and finding ways to be creative. Drawing has literally always been my favorite thing to do since elementary school. I also like music, which is an art, but I don’t make any.

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I hate the future, regret the past and enjoy the present. If I think about the future I get anxious and find it hard to move on since it’s so open to change. I don’t mind changing, I just don’t want to be stuck to one future. I want to be anything I want and not limited. If I think about the past, all I feel is regret and sadness, I don’t like thinking about the past very much. Avoid it! The present is so much better and comfortable.

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

If others personally request help then yes I’ll try my best to help them. I do have to be in the right mood though because sometimes it can be annoying and I don’t wanna deal with people whenever I’m not in the right mood. (In a good mood) I’d help because I want to seem competent enough and I want others to think I know better and am very smart and nice. I just want to make good impressions on people, if I can help it. I do feel stingy and annoyed sometimes, and that will reflect if I’m saying stuff like “ask someone else” or “no I don’t know!” Because I’m not in the right mindset to do so.

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Yes? I think everyone does, at least a little bit. I want to hear what people think and what people have to say. I like learning, if it’s something I personally care about or have put importance on knowing, for whatever reason. I think a lot of times I’d like to just sit back and ignore everything but that’s not gonna get me anywhere in life unfortunately. I’d like to know what’s literally going on around me, I don’t like feeling confused or lost, it’s upsetting. When people tell me something, I would like a reason why. Only if it’s something I don’t see a reason doing etc.

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

Important! I like being productive, my dad is way more productive and efficient than my mom and so I look up to him in that way. I want to get things done and done right, cleaning, organizing, fixing stuff, I don’t like just sitting around and letting stuff accumulate. I want to be in control of my life and physical situation, if I can help it, I like taking medicine and seeking help whenever it’s necessary. Tho- Sometimes I can neglect my health to be more convenient for others, I hate being a burden if it’s avoidable. But I will always yearn to do something to fix it, I wanna go out and buy all the things I might need and stuff that will have me feeling physically comfortable. Soap!

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Not really. I allow others to do whatever they want, the only times I feel an urge and sense of entitlement is if I KNOW I can do better and I KNOW others won’t oppose me. I like being in control of myself, I mean i literally have to. When I introduce things to others, I want to be the one who tells them and helps them figure things out because it’s a part of me, it’s special. Others are special to have me since I’m so knowledgeable and helpful, I wish others could see that in me sometimes. I only like you if I’m opening up my interests and trying to understand you!

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

Made a list: Listen to music, shop, clean, buy/look up skincare/bodycare/haircare/makeup/perfume/soaps, draw, daydream, talk online with ppl, learn & read ab typology & psychology, organize Pinterest boards, organize my room making it as comfortable and well put together as possible. I like all these things because it gives me something to do with myself, if I’m not doing something with my hands I feel so bored and incomplete. I started focusing on caring for myself because I’ve realized how much I’ve neglected myself the past few years and I want to undo all the bad habits and ideas others had of me. My mom has noticed and even said how much better I am. ^__^

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

Tactile and visual learning. I learn BEST in places where I feel comfortable, emotionally and physically. I have to like the environment and the people I’m around otherwise I see no point and will give no effort. Unfortunately a lot of my classes aren’t ideal at all and make me feel uncomfortable and sad so I struggle to learn well because of it. I also enjoy environments where I can show off my abilities, if I’m more competent and capable of understanding things better than others I feel confident and determined to do it. It’s a competitive urge within me that I need to fulfill. I prefer classes that involve physical senses and sometimes logic. I learn LEAST in places where I don’t feel confident and actually feel like I’m beneath everyone, or if I hate someone so much I refuse to try anymore or else the hate and anger will consume me.

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I am neutrally strategic. I don’t break things up into manageable tasks, I do whatever I can with whatever energy I have in me and then give up on the rest. I tend to overwork myself at first and then feel there’s no point or motivation in me and slowly or instantly drop it. This shows so much in my school performance, I start off so strong and then I need help at the end to wanna keep going. I like improvising things better, if I have to plan things out or make lists then I feel like I’m not in control of my life? If that makes sense? I like spontaneity and being free, it’s top priority!!!

• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

Every aspiration I have is all personal. I only search to fulfill what I want. I hate professionalism, I hate having to be one thing only, all the time. I want to be freely myself, if I can? I want to do whatever I want, make art, make music, make an impression on people, internet famous, worldwide famous, multi talented being! Even though it’s so unrealistic and I have no idea it’ll ever happen, a girl can still dream yk?

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I fear spiders and scorpions.. ok but more irrationally it’s probably being rejected and not valued. I fear others will hate me, I fear looking bad in front of others, I fear being negatively perceived. I try my best to avoid it, if it’s out of my control, (like people I don’t even know) then obviously I can’t do anything about it. But I try my best to know in my heart that I’m not what others think of me. It’s hard to not fear what others are thinking about and what other intentions are. I hate feeling like others don’t like me. I hate when people don’t like me! I have no idea how I could be dislike, omg so entitled sounding but I’m being fr. I hate when people misjudge and mischaracterize me. I hate when others disappoint me, like they always do. I hate being alone all the time. I hate not knowing anything, not even knowing who I am or what my purpose is. I hate feeling like there’s no more choices anymore and I’m stuck in one place forever. Seggusal topics make me uncomfortable, I don’t know why.

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

I’m very very hyper, more opinionated and loud, excited about everything and I want as much contact with people as possible. Very very sanguine! Others think I’m crazy because I will say whatever I can to get attention. I act like an attention seeker and I’m desperate to be heard and seen. I say things just to say them. I avoid thinking and having any reason, having meaning depletes my energy and fun. I’m anxious af. Jittery and spazzy. I attempt to do my best to look cute/pretty for others because it draws in more attention.

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Very avoidant. I hate attention and I spend a lot of time in bed, trying to conserve energy. I don’t try anymore, my rooms a mess, my hair and appearance is a mess. Depression? I want to sleep and cry. I’m probably mourning yet another failed attempt at making a relationship, since I put in a ton of effort emotionally and physically when trying to connect with people. Just extremely sad, you can guess the rest. 😬 apathetic and bitter.

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I want to be in reality. I like reality, I only daydream if I’m obsessed with someone. I have days where I imagine a whole relationship with somebody because no one ever satisfies me enough! I try my best to stay aware of my surroundings and stuff, though I can occasionally dissociate and detach from who I am because of despair or something. Music also makes me detach from reality, it helps me escape bad feelings. I don’t want to always disappear into my mind, others will always catch me lacking so I gotta stay aware.

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I think about anything and everything. This is a hard question to answer because… it really just depends on the day and mood I’m in. Boring af

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

Takes me a minute. I don’t like making important decisions unless I have been thinking about it for a while and feel like I can sense/feel the right choice. Whenever I make a decision I can oscillate a lot because I’m unsure and insecure of my decision. I find it personally annoying to deal with someone like that, so I try my best to stay calm and focus on what I really feel like is most right. But just know inside I’m constantly questioning my reality and if I made the right choice. I can be like “I don’t know leave me alone!” Tho.

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

I’ve analyzed my emotions for so long, i actually feel sick of them so i don’t even want to process them anymore. They will catch me off guard and i can end up crying randomly, even  seemingly for no reason. But there’s always a reason, it’s just so deep down in doubt and fear and anger , so many other things covering it. It can take minutes or days, just depends on how willing I am to have a mental breakdown in the moment. If I’m somewhere where I don’t want to look crazy, I’ll ignore my emotions and focus on whatever else that brings me more enjoyment. I don’t want to be perceived weak. Even thought I say a lot that I’m sensitive, because I truly am. Emotions are a neutral importance to me. They’re cool but honestly too irrational and confusing. I try to avoid them now.

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

YES. A lot of the time, sometimes it’s too hard to think for myself or to voice my opinions and frustrations. If I have no energy or don’t want ppl to hate me, I’ll just nod my head and agree with what people say just because it’ll make them like me. But if it’s one of those days where I’m just not feeling like it, I might be more inclined to say “no” with no explanation. I’d say this is like me 60% of the time I guess?

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

I do but only humbly. I don’t think I have to follow the rules all the time, I am my own person, I am capable of doing whatever I want. I hate rules so much. They bring me out of control and my comfort. I will eye conflict with neutrality and I’m unamused by the demands of others. No one can truly force or control what I do, that’s fact!

We used to hang out as a group (me, friend1, her boyfriend, frien2). He and I have never gotten along. And both friend1 and friend2 used to laugh it off that i ensure that he'd never hurt her, by giving him a hard time. He's mean and often even jokes about friend2's apperance. Once he took it too far, insulted me and whispered to friend1, ""Should I throw coffee on her face?"" I lashed out, and he started crying non-stop. since then things have been tense and i have asked her to ensure he doesn't hangout with us. Although friend2 keeps in touch and has become close to him now, which makes me feel alienated and left out. 

Recently, we've been playing Among Us (on friend2's request) and he always accuses me, says bad stuff, in return since friend1 doesn't stop him, I reply 2x rudely. Yesterday in class friend1 had an outburst and blamed me and said I am the one who picks on him and my motto is to remove him. I asked friend3 who picks who and she confirmed it's him only.
So yesterday night i stayed completely silent while playing (like pin drop silent) and let him talk bullshit. Later while leaving i calmly, in my most sweetest voice, pointed it out to my friend that he is the one who kept on picking at me and everyone agreed! except friend1 and him ofc. friend1 got mad and left the VC. Since then we haven't talked

Friend2 agrees he’s the problem but won’t speak up in front of friend1, maybe because she doesn't wanna end up in my situation. I don’t want to lose friend1 — she’s my closest friend, i love her more than anything. And we have a very good understanding and equation except when it comes to this.

How do I maintain this friendship without constantly being the bad guy or feeling left out? Please please help",4,1745650287.0,TeenIndia,11,1.0,False

1k86snf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k86snf/do_i_warn_her_about_a_potential_online_stalker/,Do I warn her about a potential online stalker?,"Ok, this is… a little complicated. I hope you have popcorn.

So I (42F) watch an American streamer on Twitch who has an average viewership of about 200. Let’s say her name is Brandy (49F).

Brandy and I are friendly acquaintances. We message a few times a week, and have met up a few times for lunch/coffee, with plans to do so again in the future. We’re not super close, but it’s more than just the standard Twitch parasocial relationship.

Enter Andy (40M), who’s in the UK.

Andy is one of the fanbase, and has no connection with Brandy beyond watching her streams. Andy is neurodivergent, I’m guessing autistic. Andy… is a bit of a problem. He spams the chat with the same questions, regularly shouts to get Brandy’s attention, and is at times inappropriate. His comments and messages to her basically sound like they're the only two in the stream. Andy will go AFK at then come back apologising and saying why he had to leave, things like that. 

However, that’s just in the streams. On social media, it’s even worse.

Andy posts a few times a day, and 90% of his posts, he tags Brandy. Some of them are kinda relevant to something that happened during the stream, but a lot of them are just normal posts that he’s tagging her in. He clearly wants her attention.

Brandy made some throwaway comment about Andy being a ‘puritan’. Andy, for some reason, has taken this as an incredible insult. In an attempt to convince her that he isn’t one, he posted a 2 minute video to his social media, saying he wasn’t a puritan, showing some of his artwork, and asking her for her opinion on his art. Then he added if she didn’t like it, she could eat a pile of shit because she’s not an art critic anyway and knows nothing about it.

He decided this was a hilarious joke, and during the next stream, asked Brandy if she liked eating shit. Brandy didn’t know the context, and told Andy off for saying it. She just thought he was being awkwardly funny (Brandy’s aware that Andy is ND. I mean, we all are, just from his comments in stream). Andy apologised on social media, tagging Brandy, who replied saying he’d crossed a line, but was forgiven.

Andy has been ranting to a mutual friend online about how he’s still pissed off Brandy called him a puritan and he’s going to keep posting and tagging his NSFW art until she concedes. He also basically talks about nothing but Brandy, and is obsessed with her. Like, he has crossed the line from ‘celebrity crush’ to full-on ‘desperately in love’. He joked about trying to (somehow) send her his nudes, but that she might pleasure herself to them (I've seen what Andy looks like, and... no).

Now I’m in an awkward position. Brandy is, as far as I know, unaware of this. Or at least, aware Andy has a thing for her, but not aware of how it’s escalating. Honestly, if they were in the same country, I would send her a message saying to run. Run far, run fast, don’t look back. I’m only hesitating because they’re on opposite sides of the world.

So do I tell Brandy about this guy’s increasing obsession? Or do I wait and see what happens? Andy is on the outs with the mods of the channel for his spamming and inappropriate behaviour, so they might ban him and that could be the end of it. Maybe I should just message the mods of her channel to be aware of what's been going on? I don't know if they'd tell her or not, given it's such a small group.

I’m just not sure what my next steps should be here. I don’t want Brandy to be caught unawares, but I also don’t want to freak her out. This is not the first stalker she’s had, and her last one was in the same country as her. Again, at least this one is on the other side of the world.

Andy has no access to her. He doesn’t know her address, doesn’t have access to Brandy’s DMs, Brandy used to have a mail box but she closed that down, so he can’t harass her through the mail, he only has the streams and social media public tags to contact her.

I could really use some guidance here. Any advice would be great.

And please don’t message me asking for more details about who they are. It ain’t happening.",2,1745650138.0,Advice,5,0.75,False

Hi everyone!

I’m a 20-year-old femboy with a passion for all things creative and intellectual. I’m currently studying literature at Oxford University, which is a dream come true for me. I adore immersing myself in stories, whether it’s classic novels or discovering new narratives. When I’m not buried in books, I also work as a model—an experience that’s been both fun and empowering.

A little about me:
	•	I’m autistic, which is an integral part of who I am and shapes the way I see and experience the world. It means I love diving deep into my interests and can get incredibly enthusiastic about the things I’m passionate about!
	•	My style leans feminine, and I enjoy expressing myself in ways that feel authentic and unique to me.
	•	In my free time, I love gaming, baking, and having meaningful conversations about everything from philosophy to pop culture.

I’m looking for someone who values kindness, open-mindedness, and a bit of nerdy charm. Whether you want to exchange book recommendations, chat over coffee (or virtual coffee), or take long walks while debating the merits of various literary genres, I’d love to meet you!

Feel free to drop me a message if you’re interested in chatting. Let’s see where this might go!",1,1745650039.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best iPhone X cardholder cases offer a blend of protection, functionality, and style. They need to safeguard the phone from drops and scratches while securely holding essential cards.

**Card Capacity and Security:** The ideal case should hold at least two to three cards securely.

Some cases use a sliding mechanism, while others feature a snap-on cover or a tight-fitting pouch. The security of the card storage is paramount to prevent cards from falling out accidentally. Look for cases with features like a locking mechanism or a snug fit to ensure card retention. The material and design of the cardholder should also prevent damage to the cards, such as bending or scratching.

**Material and Durability:** High-quality materials are essential for both the case and the cardholder.

Popular choices include polycarbonate (PC), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and leather. PC offers excellent impact resistance, while TPU provides flexibility and shock absorption. Leather adds a touch of elegance and durability. The case should withstand daily wear and tear, protecting the iPhone X from scratches, bumps, and drops. Reinforced corners and raised edges around the screen and camera offer additional protection.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The case should complement the iPhone X's design without adding excessive bulk.

Slim and minimalist designs are preferred by many users. The availability of various colors and finishes allows users to personalize their phone's appearance. Precise cutouts for ports, buttons, and the camera ensure easy access to all functions. A smooth, comfortable grip is also important for ease of use.

**Wireless Charging Compatibility:** Some cardholder cases can interfere with wireless charging.

It's essential to check if the case is compatible with wireless charging if you frequently use this feature. Cases that are too thick or have metal components in the cardholder area may block the wireless charging signal. Manufacturers often indicate whether their cases support wireless charging.

**Ease of Use and Accessibility:** The case should be easy to install and remove, and the cardholder should allow for quick and convenient access to the cards.

A smooth sliding mechanism or a simple snap-on cover makes accessing cards hassle-free. The design should also allow for easy removal of the cards when needed. The case should not obstruct access to the phone's buttons, ports, or camera.

Key features of the best iPhone X cardholder cases include:
* Secure card storage
* Durable construction
* Slim and stylish design
* Wireless charging compatibility
* Easy access to cards and phone functions

## Core Benefits

An iPhone X cardholder case offers several practical benefits, streamlining your daily life and reducing the need to carry a separate wallet.

**Convenience and Efficiency:** By combining phone protection with card storage, these cases eliminate the need for a separate wallet.

This is especially useful for those who prefer to travel light or frequently use public transportation. Having your essential cards readily available with your phone simplifies transactions and reduces the risk of losing your wallet. Imagine quickly accessing your transit card while commuting or paying for a coffee without fumbling through a bulky wallet.

**Enhanced Security:** Some cardholder cases offer enhanced security features to protect your cards from theft or unauthorized access.

RFID-blocking technology can prevent electronic pickpocketing, safeguarding your credit card information. Secure locking mechanisms or tight-fitting designs ensure that your cards stay in place, even during rigorous activities. This provides peace of mind knowing that your cards are safe and secure.

**Protection and Durability:** These cases provide robust protection for your iPhone X, shielding it from scratches, bumps, and drops.

The added layer of protection extends the lifespan of your phone and reduces the risk of costly repairs. The durable materials used in the construction of the case ensure that it can withstand daily wear and tear, keeping your phone looking new for longer. The raised edges around the screen and camera offer additional protection against scratches and impacts.

**Minimalist Lifestyle:** A cardholder case promotes a minimalist lifestyle by reducing clutter and simplifying your everyday carry.

By carrying only essential cards, you can eliminate the bulk of a traditional wallet and streamline your belongings. This is perfect for those who value simplicity and efficiency. A minimalist setup also encourages you to be more mindful of what you carry, reducing the risk of accumulating unnecessary items.

**Stylish and Functional:** Cardholder cases are available in a variety of styles and designs, allowing you to express your personal taste while adding functionality to your phone.

From sleek and minimalist designs to more elaborate and decorative options, there's a cardholder case to suit every style. The combination of style and functionality makes these cases a practical and fashionable accessory for your iPhone X. Choose a case that reflects your personality and complements your overall look.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about iPhone X cardholder cases:

**Will a cardholder case add significant bulk to my iPhone X?**
  No, many cardholder cases are designed to be slim and lightweight, adding minimal bulk to your phone. Look for cases that are specifically advertised as ""slim"" or ""minimalist"" to ensure a comfortable grip and pocket fit. The thickness of the case will depend on the card capacity and the materials used, but most reputable brands prioritize a streamlined design.

**Are cardholder cases compatible with wireless charging?**
  It depends on the case design and materials. Some cardholder cases, especially those with metal components or thick cardholders, can interfere with wireless charging. Check the product description or manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility with wireless charging if you frequently use this feature. Some cases are specifically designed to work with wireless chargers, even with cards stored inside.

**How secure are the cards in a cardholder case?**
  The security of the cards depends on the design of the cardholder. Look for cases with features like a locking mechanism, a snug fit, or RFID-blocking technology to ensure that your cards are secure and protected from theft or unauthorized access. Read reviews and check for feedback on card retention and security before making a purchase.

**Can the cards damage my iPhone X screen?**
  While it's unlikely, there is a small risk of the cards scratching the back of your iPhone X if they are not held securely in place. Choose a case with a soft lining or a design that keeps the cards slightly elevated from the phone's surface to prevent scratches. Consider using a screen protector for added protection.

1k86lsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifiwriting/comments/1k86lsg/how_does_this_blurb_sound/,How does this blurb sound?,"So, I have been working on a blurb for one of my works, could you tell me what you think? And maybe how I could improve it? 

""The Empire is, and it will always be. Its citizens are brought up to love its walls, and hate what is without. That all who are outside the Empire are subalterns who squander the limited resources of the galactic arm. It is an Empire that enforces itself with fire and steel, but it still calls itself merciful. Yet its citizens believed, because belief was safer than doubt. Yet in their bones, they all knew the truth: the Empire was violent, unjust, and unrelenting. It demanded loyalty, not love. Sacrifice, not justice."" - Anita the Heretic, prior to being executed, 51 PAF

But now, the Empire is gone, its vast machinery broken by rebellion and war, its grip loosened until the distant Periphery slipped free. In its place rose the Union, a coalition of newly liberated vassals and former tributary states, desperate to forge order from the wreckage of four decades of conflict. Yet peace is still not in sight. The very states that proclaim support to the Union whisper of its downfall in the same breath, each scheming to rebuild the Empire in their own image. There are still Imperial remnants about, bitter and ambitious, who wish to carve their own petty kingdoms from the vulnerable and unstable flesh of the Union.

This is the situation Lieutenant Edward Jerrol wakes up to. He is deployed on a peacekeeping (read: shoot anyone acting unfriendly) tour of the Periphery as a drone officer aboard the Light Torchship Thespis.

1k86lhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k86lhj/i_was_right_about_caffeine_pills_vs_coffee/,I was right about caffeine pills vs coffee.,"Recently I posted here saying that caffeine pills are better than coffee. Before you talk about antioxidants, talk about plant defence chemicals, mold and pesticides.

With pills you don't get any of the other bullshit that's in coffee, you don't get the addictive taste and ritual of drinking coffee and it's easier to taper down because the caffeine content can be properly measured.

Usually I drink minumum 1 coffee a day (~100mg caffeine), sometimes I drink 2 or 3 coffees. Even with 1 coffee a day every morning was terrible for me, waking up extremely hard no matter how much I slept + feeling miserable and dry as hell. 

I've been on the caffeine pills for a couple of days (50mg when I wake up) and the benefits in the morning are great. The benefits in the morning are actually the same as when I quit caffeine last year. No matter if I slept 7, 8 or 9 hours, I wake up ready to go. I literally open my eyes and I'm ready to jump out of bed and do something. The need to get myself together when I wake up is gone.

The goal is to taper down to 0mg caffeine but it'll be hard to do as there are some negatives I'm currently experiencing too at 50mg. For example I've noticed that I get tired overall quicker. My legs hurt more like I've walked 10 times the distance I actually did but I'll believe these will go away after some time. Honestly it's worth it to experience the negatives to be able to wake up so fresh.

Coffee (not just caffeine) is literal poison when consumed. Before you laugh when I say ""plant defence chemicals"" that's exactly what caffeine is by the way. The plant didn't develop caffeine for you to get high in the morning, it's a coffee's biochemical weapon that's used to protect itself against insects that want to eat the beans. :)",6,1745649353.0,decaf,10,0.72,False

1k86lbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/1k86lbh/rick_and_battle_bro/,Rick and BATTLE BRO,"TLDR: I told someone I don't like Rick and Morty, it got me into tons of situation



I never asked for this.

All I did was say, “I don’t really like *Rick and Morty*,” during a casual office lunch. That’s it. One sentence. But from that moment on, my life turned into something that felt like it *should* be a *Rick and Morty* episode — ironic, right?

It started small. Greg from accounting furrowed his brow and looked up from his chili.

“You mean you’ve never seen it?” he asked.

“No, I’ve seen it. I just don’t like it,” I said, cutting my sandwich into triangles. “It’s… try-hard smart. Feels like it’s always trying to prove how clever it is.”

Silence. Cold, judgmental silence.

Karen from HR narrowed her eyes. “But the existential themes? The multiverse theory? The dark comedy?”

“Exactly,” I said. “It’s like they Googled ‘nihilism’ once and never shut up about it.”

I thought it was over. Thought they’d forget it. But no. That was Day One of The Great *Rick and Morty* War.

By the next morning, someone had plastered Pickle Rick stickers on my monitor. My coffee mug had been replaced with one that said, “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!” in neon letters. Even worse? Someone put an “I Turned Myself Into a Pickle, Morty!” ringtone on my phone. I couldn’t find out how to turn it off. Every call sounded like a cry for help.

I tried to fight back. Brought in a *BoJack Horseman* mug just to make a point. But the fandom had already sensed blood.

That weekend, I went to a local comic shop just to pick up a gift for my cousin. As soon as I walked in, the cashier spotted me and said, “Aren’t you the guy who hates *Rick and Morty*?”

I blinked. “How do you know that?”

“Greg posted your quote on the company Slack. It went viral in a Reddit thread about ‘normies who don’t get it.’”

I had gone viral for having an opinion.

I tried to ignore it. But the harassment got weird. Like, *weird* weird.

Monday morning, I found a hand-drawn diagram on my desk explaining the philosophical roots of *Rick and Morty* with references to Camus, Einstein, and *SpongeBob SquarePants*. There was a footnote that read: “You’re just not on the right frequency, bro.”

The final straw came when I went on a first date with someone I matched with online. It was going well until she leaned over the table and said, “So... I hear you’re the Rick-hater.”

I nearly choked on my pasta.

She smiled. “My brother’s in your building. Sent me your meme. I thought it was kind of brave.”

“Brave?” I asked, bewildered.

She nodded. “You took on the fandom. Like stepping into Mordor with a wet matchstick.”

I laughed. We actually hit it off. Until dessert.

She asked, “But you’ve seen ‘The Vat of Acid Episode,’ right? That one’s genius.”

“Yeah,” I said, sipping my coffee. “Still didn’t like it.”

Her smile faded. “Oh.”

That was our last date.

Eventually, I tried to go off the grid for a bit — deleted my socials, muted every mention of *Rick and Morty*, even blocked Greg. But like some cursed VHS tape from a horror movie, the show found me. At a concert, the guy next to me had a *Rick and Morty* tattoo on his calf. At the DMV, a toddler shouted “Get Schwifty!” while his mom giggled.

Even my Uber driver once said, “You look like someone who hates *Rick and Morty*.” I asked what that meant, and he shrugged, saying, “Just a vibe.”

It was becoming too much. So I decided to lean in — not give in, just… play along.

I started attending *Rick and Morty* trivia nights. At first I just sat in the back, scowling, but eventually I realized I knew more than I wanted to admit. Against all odds, I started winning. I became “The Anti-Fan.” People loved the irony of a guy who hated the show dominating trivia. It became my brand.

One night, I got invited to a *Rick and Morty*\-themed party. I showed up wearing a plain black hoodie that said, “Still Hate It.” People thought it was hilarious.

Someone introduced me to the host — a tattooed woman with a Morty plushie on one shoulder and a real parrot on the other.

“You’re the guy!” she said. “The hater guy!”

“That’s me,” I sighed.

“You’ve got to meet my brother — he *works* on the show.”

Of course he did.

His name was Evan. He was quiet, thoughtful, and surprisingly normal. He asked me to tell him, in detail, what I didn’t like about the writing. So I did. I ranted for twenty solid minutes about tone, pacing, lazy tropes, and overused emotional whiplash.

And you know what he said?

“Honestly… you’re not wrong.”

We ended up talking for hours. I told him I didn’t *want* to hate the show. I just did. He told me he didn’t want to work on it forever. We exchanged numbers.

A week later, he asked if I wanted to consult on a script — as the “Anti-Rick.” Give notes from a non-fan perspective. Just to challenge the writers. Stir the pot.

Against every bone in my body, I said yes.

Cut to now: I’ve been in two writers’ rooms. I’ve made friends with animators. And somewhere, in a dimension not unlike our own, a version of me is probably a full-time staff writer for a show he once loathed.

But here? I still don’t like it. Not really. I respect it more now. Even laughed at a few newer episodes. But love it? No. It’s not for me.

And that’s okay. Because somehow, hating *Rick and Morty* gave me a weird little side career, a network of bizarre friends, and a spot in a fanbase that mostly wants to kill me — but kind of loves me for it too.

Who knew hate could be so productive?",2,1745649336.0,rickandmorty,1,0.75,False

• How old are you? What's your gender?

I’m 17 and I’m Demigirl 🔥

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

Not that I know of. So no!

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I had a little bit, I went to daycare at a church and learned all about it when I was 4 or 5, but it wasn’t ever forced onto me. Neither of my parents are very religious so I’m free from anything. (Agnostic) 

• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I don’t have a job currently yet, but if I were to have one I’d be store/shop related. Like a coffee shop or boba shop, and a big big store where I can walk around if I’m bored and I like restocking and organizing things. Plus I’d work somewhere like Ulta or Sephora because of the makeup and skincare products, I am very interested in those types of things.

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I would feel very lonely, if it’s one of those times where I’m very bored and need stimulation it would be like torture. The weekend is the only time I feel free to do what I want and go shopping and chill without being forced to sit in class for 8 hours! 

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

When I was younger I’d definitely say more solitude quiet activities like drawing , anything where I could stay inside. And I don’t disagree with that idea, but I’d definitely prefer being able to be WITH people. I like talking, or even listening to people talk. It’s boring without some sort of socializing, even though yes I am socially awkward and anxious. I like art, music and I really like soaps and fragrances right now so shopping and going out have been my favorite things to do.

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I’m not TOO curious, I think. At least nothing philosophical or out worldly, I only care about what’s possible in this world and time. The only times I’m curious and nosy in people’s business is if they’re talking about me, or someone I hate. I don’t want to get myself carried away with ideas and stuff because it’s too much stress for something literally not happening. I like to improvise more, I hate planning and setting limits for myself. I’m NOT philosophical or curious about anything that matters.

• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I don’t like taking on leadership positions… it’s too much pressure honestly. I like when situations are more out of my control and even a little chaotic, as long as I’m not hurt ofc. If I were a leader, I’d be more laid back about it because I hate strict rules and guidelines. Whatever I don’t like, I’ll address accordingly but it’s never that serious.

• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I do like working with my hands, following the next question…

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I AM artistic! I love art and expression like that. I like physical art way more than poetry or any other forms of art. Art I can sense, hear, see, feel is better than anything else. I lowkey hate poetry and art that’s not easy to understand like that, I like making art and finding ways to be creative. Drawing has literally always been my favorite thing to do since elementary school. I also like music, which is an art, but I don’t make any. 

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I hate the future, regret the past and enjoy the present. If I think about the future I get anxious and find it hard to move on since it’s so open to change. I don’t mind changing, I just don’t want to be stuck to one future. I want to be anything I want and not limited. If I think about the past, all I feel is regret and sadness, I don’t like thinking about the past very much. Avoid it! The present is so much better and comfortable.

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

If others personally request help then yes I’ll try my best to help them. I do have to be in the right mood though because sometimes it can be annoying and I don’t wanna deal with people whenever I’m not in the right mood. (In a good mood) I’d help because I want to seem competent enough and I want others to think I know better and am very smart and nice. I just want to make good impressions on people, if I can help it. I do feel stingy and annoyed sometimes, and that will reflect if I’m saying stuff like “ask someone else” or “no I don’t know!” Because I’m not in the right mindset to do so. 

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Yes? I think everyone does, at least a little bit. I want to hear what people think and what people have to say. I like learning, if it’s something I personally care about or have put importance on knowing, for whatever reason. I think a lot of times I’d like to just sit back and ignore everything but that’s not gonna get me anywhere in life unfortunately. I’d like to know what’s literally going on around me, I don’t like feeling confused or lost, it’s upsetting. When people tell me something, I would like a reason why. Only if it’s something I don’t see a reason doing etc. 

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

Important! I like being productive, my dad is way more productive and efficient than my mom and so I look up to him in that way. I want to get things done and done right, cleaning, organizing, fixing stuff, I don’t like just sitting around and letting stuff accumulate. I want to be in control of my life and physical situation, if I can help it, I like taking medicine and seeking help whenever it’s necessary. Tho-
Sometimes I can neglect my health to be more convenient for others, I hate being a burden if it’s avoidable. But I will always yearn to do something to fix it, I wanna go out and buy all the things I might need and stuff that will have me feeling physically comfortable. Soap!

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Not really. I allow others to do whatever they want, the only times I feel an urge and sense of entitlement is if I KNOW I can do better and I KNOW others won’t oppose me. I like being in control of myself, I mean i literally have to. When I introduce things to others, I want to be the one who tells them and helps them figure things out because it’s a part of me, it’s special. Others are special to have me since I’m so knowledgeable and helpful, I wish others could see that in me sometimes. I only like you if I’m opening up my interests and trying to understand you! 

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

Made a list: Listen to music, shop, clean, buy/look up skincare/bodycare/haircare/makeup/perfume/soaps, draw, daydream, talk online with ppl, learn & read ab typology & psychology, organize Pinterest boards, organize my room making it as comfortable and well put together as possible. I like all these things because it gives me something to do with myself, if I’m not doing something with my hands I feel so bored and incomplete. I started focusing on caring for myself because I’ve realized how much I’ve neglected myself the past few years and I want to undo all the bad habits and ideas others had of me. My mom has noticed and even said how much better I am. ^__^

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

Tactile and visual learning. I learn BEST in places where I feel comfortable, emotionally and physically. I have to like the environment and the people I’m around otherwise I see no point and will give no effort. Unfortunately a lot of my classes aren’t ideal at all and make me feel uncomfortable and sad so I struggle to learn well because of it. I also enjoy environments where I can show off my abilities, if I’m more competent and capable of understanding things better than others I feel confident and determined to do it. It’s a competitive urge within me that I need to fulfill. I prefer classes that involve physical senses and sometimes logic. I learn LEAST in places where I don’t feel confident and actually feel like I’m beneath everyone, or if I hate someone so much I refuse to try anymore or else the hate and anger will consume me.

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I am neutrally strategic. I don’t break things up into manageable tasks, I do whatever I can with whatever energy I have in me and then give up on the rest. I tend to overwork myself at first and then feel there’s no point or motivation in me and slowly or instantly drop it. This shows so much in my school performance, I start off so strong and then I need help at the end to wanna keep going. I like improvising things better, if I have to plan things out or make lists then I feel like I’m not in control of my life? If that makes sense? I like spontaneity and being free, it’s top priority!!!

• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

Every aspiration I have is all personal. I only search to fulfill what I want. I hate professionalism, I hate having to be one thing only, all the time. I want to be freely myself, if I can? I want to do whatever I want, make art, make music, make an impression on people, internet famous, worldwide famous, multi talented being! Even though it’s so unrealistic and I have no idea it’ll ever happen, a girl can still dream yk? 

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I fear spiders and scorpions.. ok but more irrationally it’s probably being rejected and not valued. I fear others will hate me, I fear looking bad in front of others, I fear being negatively perceived. I try my best to avoid it, if it’s out of my control, (like people I don’t even know) then obviously I can’t do anything about it. But I try my best to know in my heart that I’m not what others think of me. It’s hard to not fear what others are thinking about and what other intentions are. I hate feeling like others don’t like me. I hate when people don’t like me! I have no idea how I could be dislike, omg so entitled sounding but I’m being fr. I hate when people misjudge and mischaracterize me. I hate when others disappoint me, like they always do. I hate being alone all the time. I hate not knowing anything, not even knowing who I am or what my purpose is. I hate feeling like there’s no more choices anymore and I’m stuck in one place forever. Sexual topics make me uncomfortable, I don’t know why. 

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

I’m very very hyper, more opinionated and loud, excited about everything and I want as much contact with people as possible. Very very sanguine! Others think I’m crazy because I will say whatever I can to get attention. I act like an attention seeker and I’m desperate to be heard and seen. I say things just to say them. I avoid thinking and having any reason, having meaning depletes my energy and fun. I’m anxious af. Jittery and spazzy. I attempt to do my best to look cute/pretty for others because it draws in more attention. 

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Very avoidant. I hate attention and I spend a lot of time in bed, trying to conserve energy. I don’t try anymore, my rooms a mess, my hair and appearance is a mess. Depression? I want to sleep and cry. I’m probably mourning yet another failed attempt at making a relationship, since I put in a ton of effort emotionally and physically when trying to connect with people. Just extremely sad, you can guess the rest. 😬 apathetic and bitter.

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I want to be in reality. I like reality, I only daydream if I’m obsessed with someone. I have days where I imagine a whole relationship with somebody because no one ever satisfies me enough! I try my best to stay aware of my surroundings and stuff, though I can occasionally dissociate and detach from who I am because of despair or something. Music also makes me detach from reality, it helps me escape bad feelings. I don’t want to always disappear into my mind, others will always catch me lacking so I gotta stay aware.

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I think about anything and everything. This is a hard question to answer because… it really just depends on the day and mood I’m in. Boring af

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

Takes me a minute. I don’t like making important decisions unless I have been thinking about it for a while and feel like I can sense/feel the right choice. Whenever I make a decision I can oscillate a lot because I’m unsure and insecure of my decision. I find it personally annoying to deal with someone like that, so I try my best to stay calm and focus on what I really feel like is most right. But just know inside I’m constantly questioning my reality and if I made the right choice. I can be like “I don’t know leave me alone!” Tho.

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

I’ve analyzed my emotions for so long, i actually feel sick of them so i don’t even want to process them anymore. They will catch me off guard and i can end up crying randomly, even  seemingly for no reason. But there’s always a reason, it’s just so deep down in doubt and fear and anger , so many other things covering it. It can take minutes or days, just depends on how willing I am to have a mental breakdown in the moment. If I’m somewhere where I don’t want to look crazy, I’ll ignore my emotions and focus on whatever else that brings me more enjoyment. I don’t want to be perceived weak. Even thought I say a lot that I’m sensitive, because I truly am. Emotions are a neutral importance to me. They’re cool but honestly too irrational and confusing. I try to avoid them now.

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

YES. A lot of the time, sometimes it’s too hard to think for myself or to voice my opinions and frustrations. If I have no energy or don’t want ppl to hate me, I’ll just nod my head and agree with what people say just because it’ll make them like me. But if it’s one of those days where I’m just not feeling like it, I might be more inclined to say “no” with no explanation. I’d say this is like me 60% of the time I guess? 

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

I do but only humbly. I don’t think I have to follow the rules all the time, I am my own person, I am capable of doing whatever I want. I hate rules so much. They bring me out of control and my comfort. I will eye conflict with neutrality and I’m unamused by the demands of others. No one can truly force or control what I do, that’s fact!

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Crude Craft Coffee Bar experience hinges on a few crucial features that set it apart from your average coffee shop. These establishments prioritize quality and craftsmanship above all else.

**Direct-Trade Sourcing:** Crude Craft Coffee Bars champion ethical sourcing, partnering directly with farmers to obtain high-quality beans.

This direct relationship ensures fair compensation for farmers and allows for greater transparency in the bean's journey from farm to cup. By bypassing traditional supply chains, these coffee bars often offer unique and rare varieties of coffee, providing customers with an opportunity to sample beans with distinct origins and flavor profiles. Customers can often learn about the farms and the specific processes used to cultivate the beans, fostering a deeper appreciation for the art of coffee production.

**Minimalist Design:** The aesthetic of a Crude Craft Coffee Bar typically leans towards simplicity and functionality.

Expect clean lines, exposed brick, and a focus on natural light. This minimalist design creates a calming and uncluttered atmosphere, allowing customers to fully focus on the coffee and the experience. The absence of excessive decor is intentional, drawing attention to the craftsmanship of the baristas and the quality of the ingredients. This design philosophy emphasizes the purity and simplicity of the coffee itself.

**Manual Brewing Methods:** These coffee bars often employ manual brewing methods, such as pour-over, French press, or Aeropress, to precisely control the brewing process.

These methods allow baristas to fine-tune variables like water temperature, bloom time, and grind size, resulting in a cup of coffee that highlights the unique characteristics of the beans. The use of manual brewing is a testament to the dedication and skill of the baristas, who act as artisans, crafting each cup with meticulous care.

The quiet, rural town provided the writer, David Wilson the sense of ease he so desperately desired. Emelia Wilson, however, wasn’t partial to the idea of uprooting their life in Bismarck, North Dakota to move into their husband’s late father’s farmhouse. The property had belonged to Teddy Wilson, a heavy smoker until suffering a severe heart attack the year prior. In May of 1972, just days before Elizabeth’s 8th birthday, David had planned a family camping trip. The Wilsons had planned for a week long get away to Wildcat Hills, Nebraska though this trip was cut short only a day later.

Spoken account from Johnathan A. , a friend of the family since they had moved in…

“They left with a trunk full of supplies- about three or four days worth… but they came back just bought’ two in the mornin’. I was sitting on my porch jus’ lissen’n to the critters russlin’ around when i see Dave pull up his driveway. He \[David\] muss’ve left a light on in the house because, i’ve never seen ‘em rush inside like that. His \[David\] wife was followin’ behind him carrying ’lizabeth inna blanket. Strange thashee’ was able to sleep through all that frantic jibber-jabber ‘Meela \[Emilia\] was talking.”

Shortly upon arrival home, Elizabeth had but altogether disappeared, quietly as if her existence was a mere visit to this planet. Mrs. Wilson had thought it best to pull her from Winneborough Elementary and continue her education away from the prying eyes of people. Winneborough, being the small quiet but lively community that Winneborough was, it hadn't taken long for gossip to spread among the townsfolk.  Some had said she had been kidnapped but with heavy assurance from Emilia, that thought had been quickly shot down. When approached one morning, the severely tired looking man, David Wilson, had reportedly been irritated with the mention of his daughter.

Neither David or Emilia Wilson are willing to speak about the events that transpired during the trip. Neighbors frequently visited the Wilson’s, though not knowing the details, had shown concern for Elizabeth. The good people of Winneborough, with all the hospitality of saints, had often expressed worry for the child, under the impression that she had suddenly fallen very ill. Church raffles to raise money, newspaper tabloids begging surrounding areas for prayer, these people had truly cared about the Wilson’s kid. 

Excerpt of the journal of David Wilson

“August 12th 1972,

… From Elizabeth's mouth was a cry like a roaring moped as she screamed out against the dense, warm air of the attic. Tonight marks the third instance of this occurrence…She was weeping in agony as she laid in her own filth while the illness tore at her weak body. The terror she had felt had finally seemed to fold in itself as she lay unconscious but only shortly as moments later she awoke screaming. In the mornings the neighbors ask about her, - drinking my black coffee on the porch as i smoke my cancer stick, in any way they can possibly weasel in the question “how is she” over and over. “How is she” “fine” “if you need anything…” How could anyone possibly help? Get the pope! The Vatican’s tourists not in town but, the circus should swing by in October! That mass in the attic, Emilia lies to herself… that’s not our daughter.”

End of excerpt…

In September of 1983, failed comedian and radio host, Adam Penne, had taken it upon himself “to get answers”. Whether it be his genuine curiosity or his recently failing radio career, Penne had requested a written account from Elizabeth Wilson herself. Adam Penne, the bold risk taker, had believed reading this letter \[live on air\] and talking about the Wilsons incident \[live on air\], would save his career.

Following is the written account from Elizabeth, kept indefinitely at a psychiatric care facility thirty-three miles out from Bismarck, North Dakota as per request from David and Emilia:

“I thought I might forever lay in that field, the gentle grass flowing over my body. Resting in a damp bed of the brush as myself lies weak, bitten in the arm. Nothing but a daze and yet the subtle sound of the wind pushing like waves in the field held my attention like a sort of hypnosis. Besides my body was the animal, lying calmly- a strange sense of calm was mutual between us as if  the beast had been my pet since I was an infant. This intrusion, it meant no harm more than what it had done, in my head i knew that, somehow that was communicated within the air. My father had found me hours later, as the sun began to settle along the hills to take its rest and exit stage. The animal had fled moments prior, hearing the heavy footsteps invading the calm atmosphere it had built around us like a bubble. Upon my arrival to the car, my mother Emilia, was hysterically crying for me. “Elizabeth” had escaped her cries and jumped to the stillness surrounding that dirt road whereas that vanilla-colored Ford Country Squire was parked.  Where the animal had placed its jaws onto me, with its yellowed teeth, it had left my arm a bloody wound. A strip of beef jerky fresh off the counter of the gas station, the kind of ones my father would buy along with his cigarettes.”

Upon reading this letter on his radio show, Adam Penne had captured the publics attention yet again. Successful in his goal to revive his career, he had sky-rocketed into the flourishing money-making sport of paranormal investigation. Within the walls of his studio, he had began to host his weekly ghost stories, captivating the listeners with frequenting guests of all sorts of paranorm. October proved rocky for this self proclaimed ‘radio horror pioneer’ as with the hospitalization  of his most recent guest, Lisa MacFinlay. Lisa MacFinlay, a young American psychic and NYU graduate had been approached by Penne on October 3rd with hopes to recruit her for his On Air Halloween Party. MacFinlay had been hesitant to accept his request but after the gentle push of five hundred dollars, she had been less unenthused. Arriving at the studio on halloween night by means of taxi cab, MacFinlay had reportedly been seen perturbed. By 8:38 at night, Lisa MacFinlay had sat before the microphone adjacent to Adam Penne. 



II



As she sat in the quiet room with the olive colored walls, she had folded her hands nervously on the wooden desk in front of her, noticing the brown ring stains of many past placed coffee cups. At 9 PM, Adam had kicked off his show, with sardonic jokes and commentary on the recent events in Brooklyn. Lisa MacFinlay patiently awaited her introduction ‘Lisa MacFinlay, enter stage left’ she had repeated in her head like a mock mantra. “Now” Penne said “without further ado, our guest for the evening…” Adam had shifted his gaze to the anxious psychic. After a moment of brief silence, MacFinlay sat up straight in her chair as Adam had begun repeatedly pounding his hands upon the desk as a sort of drum roll. “Lisa McEntire, everybody!” Although Penne had worn his sunglasses inside every room of every building, Lisa had felt his eyes stab at her, impatiently waiting for her to speak.

As the night rolled on, MacFinlay grew irritated with the radio host’s constant uninformed opinions on every topic partially discussed. “Now, here is really something…” Penne said addressing the microphone as he slid an envelope across the table. Lisa had felt sudden unease as she stared at the torn open yellow envelope “a real treat for fans of dogs” Penne added obnoxiously. With hesitation, Lisa had picked up the envelope “what signals are you picking up so far?” the radio host asked sarcastically as he smiled widely, his coffee stained teeth shined wetly. Lisa hadn’t responded as she look at the envelope wide-eyed and began to pull out the letter inside, unfolding the letter and placing it neatly upon the stained wood table. The psychic placed her fingers upon the hand written letter and began gently tracing the blue inked words as she murmured to herself. Without looking at the radio host, she asked “the Wilson’s girl?” the radio host’s smile grew “yes ‘the Wilson’s girl’” he added laughing.

The psychics' unease grew as she began feverishly tracing the indentations on the page, not only reading but seeing. With her eyes now shut tightly and the look of distress on her pale freckled face, she began to mumble quietly. Lisa saw Elizabeth as she cried on the field's soft floor, confused and in pain. The bite, the beast, the vanilla-colored Ford, the warm-dense-dim attic. It all flooded over the psychics mind like the paste on paper mâché. “Any signs from the other side?” Penne tossed these words into the air finally anchoring the psychic back to her chair in the olive colored room “She’s not dead, you *know* that.” MacFinlay snipped as she stood up quickly, the chair loudly wailing across the floor as she did. “These are just jokes, folks!” the failing radio host added nervously, with those words uttered Lisa Macfinlay had already scooped up her brown corduroy bag and was making her way to the door ‘Lisa MacFinlay: Exit Stage Right’.

She had heard irritated echoes of words as she slammed the door behind her. Moving along the ugly hallway of the building, the faint rhythmic buzzing of the yellowed lights filling her mind. She now stood in front of the red door at the end of the hall, closing her eyes and turning the knob as she thought *‘five hundred dollars’*. Gently pushing, she had opened the door, the streetlights highlighting the wet road in front of her. The psychic eyed the bar across the street, thought briefly about the cash again and then the neon sign across from her. The sign flickered slowly as the blue  fluorescent outline of the martini drew her in like a moth into the sun. MacFinlays tired eyes stared vacantly as she crossed, her body moving as though she was floating, a specter. The psychic-specter made it only halfway across the street as her ghostly form was illuminated by two bright lights flying towards her.
