1g8abpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeneticCounseling/comments/1g8abpx/desperate_for_a_job_after_graduating/,Desperate for a job after graduating,"   I graduated in May and just passed boards in August. I started applying after I passed thinking the certification would give me competitive advantage, but so far have gotten only rejections. My loan payments will be coming up soon so I need a job asap. I’ve started considering applying to non-GC positions like clinical research coordinator, but I’ve heard they prefer a 2 year commitment which doesn’t seem realistic for me considering I’ll be applying to GC positions while working. I also considered even applying to GCA positions, but have read that that isn’t a great idea either if I don’t plan on staying more than a year because of the extensive training. 
      So many of these clinical non-GC positions seem to require some sort of commitment, but given that I ultimately want to land a GC position, I feel like I’m stuck. I’m so desperate I’ve considered applying to the coffee shop I used to work at, but I’m afraid that will look like I’ve “given up”, or will reflect poorly as a gap in my resume (not to mention the shame that will come with having a masters in genetics while working food service 😩) 
     Does anyone have any advice for what jobs to aim for in the mean time while I continue my GC job search? And during interviews for temporary positions, how can I politely say that I’m not looking to stay any longer than 6 months to a year without ruining my chance of getting an offer?

2 or so months ago something big happened in her life, at the same time she met another man without me knowing and started seeing him behind my back. They screwed and when I tried taking her out for a coffee date she apologized and admitted to being on a date with him which broke my heart. (I only found out about the sleeping later from mutuals)

I lost most of my friends as we were intertwined, she was my best friend and the only person who really got me.

7 weeks of struggles with processing this, not knowing what happened when she had indicated things were good (she was gonna move in with me, she had called me the closest thing she had) and she reaches out to me. To a life partner, told me she didn't wanna jeopardize our situation, etc)
And she reaches out to me offering coffee and closure which I declined. She then tells me she has news that may affect me and would like to call, I decline and say she can txt me, she txts me saying she is now in a relationship with an acquaintance we had met at the same time, mutual friends confirmed he was the guy she was seeing behind my back. 

I sent a scathing txt back saying how worthless she made me feel and that I didn't realize I was worth so little to her, told her she did something terrible and told her not to contact me. She responded with her closure. In summary she said.

* She let it go on for too long and she tried being good enough for me and my fucked expectations

* She was happy to be with me because I didn't physically hurt or rape her but my words made her feel terrible and she got sick of it

* I'm a terrible communicator and too resistant to change, she also admitted to being a terrible communicator 

* I'm autistic and so is she 🤷

* I enjoyed being around her because she understood me and it must be hard not having a best friend anymore

* She doesn't regret what she did but is appalled at how she handled it, knows she has hurt me deeply and will live with it for years

* Don't hate the guy she's seeing, he didn't know what was happening and still doesn't

* Admitted it was a relationship even though it was never official, and she apologizes for not communicating how she felt for who knows how long.

I've taken her words as guidance for how to improve upon myself, I am not perfect and I never realized how my words can hurt people like they did with her. I have been told I don't give enough affirmation and I will work on these things. In saying that, all this closure did was really rile me up, there was no apology for sleeping around behind my back which led to this whole thing ending. Just insults, calling me autistic and abusive. Meanwhile she wanted to move in with me and told me things were great, called me her life partner and stayed over every third or so night to just be with me.

She also told me people have admitted to having crushes on me, called me funny, kind and cute. Which I found patronizing and gross given the context of the conversation. When asked I was told I'm not allowed to know who and got told to do the leg work myself.

I don't know what to do with this, I don't have any questions for her anymore which makes me think this is closure but I'm stuck in a loop of negative thinking, this really reopened what I thought was a healing wound. My only friends to discuss this with are also her friends and they are getting a bit sick of me since she's moved on and so should I, so I turn to reddit for wisdom.",1,1729461644.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Then, they immediately locked the post. By locking it, I’ve been deprived of many expert opinions. So, I’ve decided to share it here on this larger subreddit, **PcBuild**. I hope the admin will approve the post and keep the post unlocked. Thanks in advance.

I purchased a **Zotac RTX 4080 16GB AMP Extreme Airo** from an authorized shop in BD on August 6, 2023. Living in a poor third-world country, buying this GPU wasn’t easy; it cost me **a fortune of $1,572.** Just over a year after buying it, on **October 3, 2024**, I experienced something extremely shocking.

I was simply watching a YouTube video with 5-6 Chrome tabs open when I suddenly heard a ""frrr, frrr, frrr"" noise. When I looked at my PC, to my shock, I saw **actual flames** inside my PC case!

Thankfully, my main power cord was right next to my desk, and I immediately disconnected it. At first, I thought the fire was coming from the PSU (**MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 1000W 80+ Gold**). But when I took a closer look, I found a large soot mark on the glass door of my **Thermaltake View 51 TG case**. I opened the case and discovered that more than **1 cm** of the **GPU’s circuit board** at the edge was severely burnt.

[Can you see that more than 1 cm of the PCB under the metal shield is charred?](https://preview.redd.it/1ycxde2vvyvd1.jpg?width=8000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=416c1b77198be71e23417e2d71aa2c08e1babaab)

I’ve always treated this GPU with great care: **no overclocking, no tweaking, no gaming.** It was primarily used for **light video editing** (FB reels for clients), where the GPU faced minimal pressure. However, I had plans to use this GPU for more graphics-intensive tasks in the future, especially once I had the chance to learn software like Autodesk Maya.

Additionally, my apartment is equipped with an **over-voltage circuit breaker** that trips if the voltage goes above 250V. The weather was completely normal at the time, and I have a **dedicated grounding line** specifically for my PC and its peripherals. 

[The over-voltage circuit breaker typically shows 10-15V higher. At the time of taking the picture, it displayed 243V, but the actual voltage was 228V.](https://preview.redd.it/jwistbx8yyvd1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc9ee1bb36508a3ba97f985726ebdf3c050da1c1)

I regularly monitor my system’s temperature using HWInfo on my Windows 10 taskbar, and my case’s lighting is set up to provide **visual feedback on temperature.** It stays blue when the temperature is between 50-60°C, turns yellow above 70°C, and becomes fully red at 90°C. At the time of the incident, **the case lighting was blue**, which made sense because I wasn’t doing anything intensive, just watching a YouTube video with 5-6 other tabs open.

I live in a two-room apartment alone, where there is **no cooking** (except tea and coffee). I use it mainly as my office and have made sure that **no cockroaches (either American or German), lizards, or mice** can live here. That’s why I have the courage to keep my large PC case on the floor to ensure **maximum airflow.**

So, despite all these precautions, why did my GPU suddenly **catch fire?** What’s worse, had I not been near my PC and quickly disconnected the power cord, the fire could have easily **spread to the rest of the PC and possibly my entire apartment!**

Moreover, if this **sudden fire explosion** from the GPU had occurred on the side where the **motherboard, AIO, RAM, and SSDs** are located, they could have been damaged in a split second before I had a chance to disconnect the power cord!

After doing some research, I learned that the main reason for localized burns on a PCB is component failure. Therefore, it is clear that this life-threatening fire hazard was caused by **Zotac's poor component quality.** I used to be a fan of Zotac because of their futuristic and excellent designs, but no more.

I demand adequate compensation from Zotac for this fire incident. It's unacceptable that **my life and property** were put in **danger** due to their negligence in quality control.",0,1729461587.0,PcBuild,3,0.5,False

Magic and Technology in Fantasy: An OverviewMagitech vs. TechnopathySystems That Fuse Magic and TechnologyThemes Found in Technomagic SystemsExamples of Technomagic in Books, Film, and GamesTechnomagic Systems: Closing Thoughts11 Minute Read

Seemingly as incompatible as oil and water, magic and science have long been at opposite ends of the fantasy versus science fiction binary. Any science fantasy enthusiast who’s spent time with these genres knows this dichotomy to be false, however, and that science and magic can have a beautiful relationship rooted in technology.

We call this marriage **technomagic**.

In this article we will discuss:

* A brief history of technology and magic together in speculative fiction.
* The difference between magitech and technopathy.
* Some magic systems that utilize both.
* Common themes explored in settings with technomagic.
* A few examples of technomagic in literature, gaming, film, and TV.

So, sit back and relax in your [MageHand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand)™ massage chair, strap on your real virtuality headset (please ensure its lightning elemental batteries are fully charged), and fire up your coffee maker crafted by the finest gnomish artificers. We’re plugging into the matrix of technomagic systems.

# Magic and Technology in Fantasy: An Overview

Before we get any further, it’s important to note that technology is a big term on its own. Pencils, paper, boats, and even the wheel were once considered advanced technology and, by definition, remain “technology.”

*Photo: Pexels*

What we’re discussing in this article is **sufficiently advanced technology**. In other words, technology that is considered advanced relative to the setting’s time. For a deeper dive into this subject and tips on crafting your own original technologies, Morgan Biscup has a fantastic piece on writing [believable technologies in fiction](https://blog.vazdimet.com/2022/11/believable-technology.html).

So, can magic and technology play nicely together? Absolutely!

All you need for technomagic is a piece of semi-ubiquitous, advanced technology that utilizes, or is utilized by, some [form of magic](https://www.campfirewriting.com/learn/systems-of-magic). Here are some quick examples:

* Combustion engines powered by captured fire elementals.
* Flintlock rifles carved with runes to help them fire farther and with greater efficiency (or perhaps magically altered gunpowder that fires even when wet).
* Power armor that runs on and can unleash souls of the slain.

One of the earliest examples of technomagic in speculative fiction is found in Robert A. Heinlein’s novella [*Magic, Inc.*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Waldo-Magic-Inc/Robert-A-Heinlein/9781476736358), which takes place in a (then) present-day where, for example, your taxi might be a flying carpet, yet all the other rules of taxis apply (driver, meter, traffic, etc). Since then, the prospect of magic and technology merging has enthralled many science fantasy writers.

# Magitech vs. Technopathy

The two terms are certainly related thematically but ultimately separate in practice.

**Magitech, or magitek**, is sufficiently advanced technology that is inherently magical, fueled by magical elements, and/or produces a magical, or seemingly magical, effect. It requires little-to-no magical training or ability and can be manufactured and distributed as freely as the setting’s resource constraints allow.

**Technopathy, or technomancy**, on the other hand, is the ability or capacity for an individual to communicate with, replicate, manipulate, or otherwise affect technology either inherently or with a spell. Technopaths utilize technology as though it itself is an elemental force like fire or electricity.

# Blurring the Lines Between Magic and Technology

Magitech and technopathy can absolutely be used simultaneously, but they are distinct categories of technology-based magic systems.

In both cases, however, a magic system can also be considered magitech or technopathy if the effect is seemingly magical enough and the technology sufficiently advanced for **our own time period or reality**.

An example of this can be found in the [*Horizon*](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn/) games where mechanized monsters are crafted and animated as if by magic, and technology is advanced far beyond our comprehension. Our hero Aloy can affect both with her [Override](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Override) device, which could be considered a piece of technomantic magitech.

Though the in-world driver behind these phenomena is scientific and technological, with no inherent magic to be seen, the effect is magical to our eyes (and, frankly, to most of the people in that world’s eyes). Therefore, *Horizon’s* identity as magitechnical and technomantic holds true despite not truly being magic by its own internal logic.

*From the cover of book one in Brian McClellan's Powder Mage trilogy, ""Promise of Blood."" (Photo: Orbit Books)*

# The Possible Effects of Magic on Technology

Magic can also affect technology incidentally (see most gunpowder fantasy works, i.e., [Powder Mage Universe](https://www.brianmcclellan.com/powder-mage-universe), [The Shadow Campaigns](https://djangowexler.com/series/the-shadow-campaigns/), and [The Wax and Wayne Series](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistborn_(series))). However, it won’t qualify as magitech or technopathy unless the technology itself is magical or the magic system is solely focused on directly affecting the technology.

For example, in the Powder Mage Universe, there is a class of magic user who can affect black powder—ignite it from afar, or put extra force behind their shot or curve rounds—but the bullets, powder, nor the rifle themselves are magical.

This could, however, be considered technopathy as the magic is solely focused on the chemically explosive black powder as a piece of technology itself.

# Systems That Fuse Magic and Technology

While there are many different manifestations of technomagic systems, a few seem to appear more than others and distinguish themselves as subcategories in their own right. Keep in mind that terminology varies and these are not officially recognized terms by anyone.

# Technorganics

Imagine you could replace any body part with a mechanically enhanced, network-connected, probably superpowered version. This is technorganics.

Often called “cyberkinetics” and those who utilize them “cyborgs,” these technology-enhanced superhumans are often faster, stronger, tougher, and more tuned into their environment thanks to their mechanical implants.

⚠️*Caution: the use of technorganics may cause hallucinations of digital ghosts, sensitivity to electrical surges, feelings of love and affection toward computers, apathy toward biotic life and nature, and complete disassociation from humanity. Ask your doctor if technorganics is right for you.*

The line between magitech, technopathy, and simply advanced technology rooted in theoretical science grows paper thin here. While drilling an energy cannon into your forearm or installing jaw implants that allow you to breathe fire are pretty clearly magitech, a mechanical heart that pumps blood more efficiently and lungs that better distribute oxygen aren’t magical in nature (or that far off).

# Cybermancy

Seeing the cyberscape of ones and zeros as a realm unto itself, cybermancers use their typically innate technopathy to tap into the digital world of computers. Practitioners may not always be cybersorcerers, however, with some using cybernetic implants to plug into the matrix in order to gain control over their perceived environment.

Not dissimilar from the spirit realm found in many high fantasy properties, the digital world has its own ecosystem of computer-generated characters to question and wonky physics to contend with.

Sometimes called [netrunners](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Netrunner) or simply super hackers, it takes a certain mental plasticity and reckless abandon to venture into a space where the consequences of being digitally ripped apart by a binary revenant are as real as taking a bullet in the meatspace.

*Link from Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. (Photo: Nintendo)*

# Magidata

Just as information can be digitized and distributed electronically, data can be shared via arcane devices. Whether brandishing your [Shiekah Slate](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Sheikah_Slate) or accessing [V.A.T.S.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/VATS) through your Pip-Boy, magidata will provide you information about your environment that no real-world technology could have access to.

This kind of technology-based magic system shows up a lot more than you think. Aloy’s [Focus](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Focus), all of Tony Stark’s [J.A.R.V.I.S. and friends](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Stark_Computer_Systems), and most [Pokétech](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex) (clearly the [Pokéball](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball) is using magidata to digitize living creatures and shove them into a convenient container) must utilize digital magic of some sort.

One could argue that magidata makes sense as a form of sufficiently advanced technology in its own contexts. In our world, however, the ability for a computer to display interactable holographic information in midair, or to gauge the exact vitality of a subject limb-by-limb, remains the purview of science fiction and magitech.

# Themes Found in Technomagic Systems

Aside from just being damn good fun, magic is often employed as a way to explore futurisic themes and philosophical questions. Technology-based systems have the benefit of being tethered to items at least tangentially familiar to us, being similar to objects we use in our daily lives. This gives magitech a wide range of subjects to explore that are familiar to a modern audience.

*Photo: Pexels*

# Artificial Intelligence

These days, A.I. is on the tip of everyone’s tongues and at the forefront of so many important conversations. Technomagic systems offer a unique opportunity to explore the capabilities of A.I. while navigating the nature of consciousness itself and whether life can be formed out of this emerging technology.

Perhaps your technomancer has telepathic power over some artificially intelligent entity and must decide if she’ll use this ability to gain greater empathy for potentially a new personhood or compel them to do her bidding. She might wrestle with this problem even as she issues commands and feels their despair.

# Transhumanism

[Transhumanism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/transhumanism) is the “philosophical and scientific movement that advocates the use of current and emerging technologies—such as genetic engineering, cryonics, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology—to augment human capabilities and improve the human condition.”

In speculative fiction, technomagics can be used to explore the good and bad of this concept with biotechnological augmentations, cybernetic brain implants that practically allow technopathy, controlling the artificial minds of artificial intelligences, and so much more.

# Immortality

If safe, efficient mechanical organs are developed that can effectively replace old biotic ones when they fail, it’s plausible that with the right resources, influence, and even infamy, certain individuals could achieve immortality.

This brings with it a dozen interesting questions exploring power with unlimited time, the [benefits of facing death](https://voyagecomics.com/2020/03/13/why-do-we-fear-death-here-are-tolkiens-thoughts/), and even the nature of deity. With enough time, can anyone achieve widespread authority? Does death provide a reason to live? What is a god but a being with great power who never dies?

# Augmented and Virtual Realities

Like artificial intelligence, augmented reality (AR) is a hot topic, especially in the gaming industry. Along with virtual reality (VR), gaming companies have been exploring ways to bring players deeper and deeper into fully immersive gaming experiences.

In a world where technology is or can be manipulated by magic, AR/VR could become anything from straight-up illusion magic to carefully constructed artificial dimensions—a reality that’s [not as far off](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro) as you may think.

Imagine a setting in which vampiric technopaths roam the neon streets at night prowling for VR gamers to enchant. Or where AR goggle lenses are crafted using magical crystals that, by using evocation techniques, allow cybermages to bring their wildest imaginings into reality.

# Examples of Technomagic in Books, Film, and Games

*The Founders trilogy. (Photo: Tor Books)*

# The Founders Trilogy

Essentially a programming language for coding reality, *scriving* plays a vital role in this trilogy by [Robert Jackson Bennett](https://www.campfirewriting.com/learn/interview-robert-jackson-bennett). Two variants play throughout the series: Tevanni and hierophantic commands.

Scrivers from Tevanne work to ""code"" an object to behave contradictory to reality. To do this, a metal plate containing a sequence of sigils must be attached to the object near a lexicon. These are dictionaries of definitions that define what the sigils are actually commanding. Real-life programmers will love this technomagic system as Tevanni scrivers must consider every possible variable for a command to be successful lest the results be deadly (but often spectacular).

Directly altering reality, hirophantic commands don’t require lexicons. Even by normal scriving standards, these commands achieve the impossible (like affecting the human body or time itself). Though rather macabre, hierophantic scriving requires a sacrifice of human time (effectively, a human sacrifice). A hierphant, therefore, is a scriver that has achieved so many sacrifices that they may use these commands, ostensibly, forever.

# Cyberpunk 2077

What can we say about *Cyberpunk 2077*?

It’s got pseudo-magical technorganics in the form of cyberware, their netrunners are essentially gritty technopaths, and sufficiently advanced magitech exists around every neon-clad corner.

The game (and its TTRPG predecessor) explores questions of transhumanism, augmented reality, and immortality through both cybernetically enhanced organ replacement, artificial networks and entities, soul-storing data chips, and raw infamy.

If you want to check out nearly every technomagic trope in the book, this is a one-stop-chopshop stock-loaded with all the chrome you could ever need.

# The Matrix

It’s difficult to describe succinctly just how impactful *The Matrix* has been for technomagical concepts across the spec-fic spectrum. If you want to build a system that employs cybermancy via virtual reality on an epic scale, look no further than Neo and friends for inspiration.

For those who haven’t yet seen this sci-fi staple (the statute of limitation on spoilers is lifted at this point), the Matrix is a massive virtual reality program to keep humans docile and farmable. One individual, Neo, has the ability to see through the program and, eventually, modify it on the fly (i.e. cybermancy).

# Fringe

Fighting science with mad science all while exploring a pseudo-magical alternate universe, the characters in *Fringe* experience a lot that could easily be framed as technomagic.

From time-traveling Faraday cages and dimensional portals to atom-oscillating harmonics and chemically altered, trans-universal children, you’re sure to find plenty of inspiration for your own magic-technology infusions.

# Kubo and the Two Strings

Remember how we said paper was technology? Well, the titular Kubo uses his papyromantic shamisen to create complex and beautiful origami constructs. Early on, he simply uses the instrument to put on magical paper performances. As the film continues, his prowess with the shamisen grows and its powers expand.

Regardless of whether the instrument is magitech or Kubo technopathic, *Kubo and the Two Strings* is a reminder that analog technology can count as technomagic.

Or what a particular coffee is supposed to taste like when home brewing?

Background:  I’m fairly new to brewing my own coffee. Tried a Cemex but recently got a Kalita 185. I also bought my first non grocery store coffee and I’m not sure if I’m even remotely close to what other people taste with this coffee.

The biggest issue here is that I have absolutely no idea what these “flavor notes” actually taste like.  I watched a James Hoffman video on tasting and it corrected my expectations on what “sweet” means in relation to coffee. I was expecting to extract some sort of sweetness in line with a flavored coffee.

But I purchased Onyx Southern Weather and I don’t know if I’m tasting the “juicy citrus finish” or if I’ve butchered the brew and it’s just sour (which I’m not really a fan of, I’d rather it be slightly bitter if anything)?

I have a 1Zepresso hand grinder and have tried a couple different brew methods. One with minimal agitation and one with a lot. I feel like my grind has been on the finer side and since I’m not getting any bitterness I haven’t changed grind settings.

I don’t have any coffee obsessed friends to bounce these questions off of, I went to 1 local shop here around Houston and saw a Kalita, I was going to ask questions but when I brought it up they said they’ve never used it.  There is another shop here that does offer a pour over coffee, but I haven’t been yet.

I know ultimately I should aim for a cup that I think tastes good, but the reviews I saw on southern weather is really making me question if it’s the bean I dislike or me brewing it.  I’ve made decent cups with other beans but I don’t know about the comparative quality to Onyx.",2,1729461350.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

","Posting on one of my rp accounts for anonymity

Just to be clear, I am not looking for any kind of moral judgment for or against me or my ex.  I just want advice on what I should do here.

I was in a relationship with them for 4 years.  I'm asexual and likely demiromantic, they're poly, bi, and hypersexual.  My love languages are quality time and gift giving, his is physical touch which I hate.  I'm convinced we only lasted as long as we did because despite living not too far from each other (within an hour) we were effectively long-distance for a while because of covid, and by the time lockdowns were lifted we'd ended up with a rhythm.

I'm not a touchy-feely or mushy person.  I like being alone.  And since breaking up with him I've genuinely been so much happier.  I don't cover up as much, I actually wear dresses and dress feminine sometimes.  I sometimes wear more suggestive cosplays to conventions.

When we broke up, I basically ghosted them.  I stopped talking to their friends, after we got together to exchange some things I haven't seen him since, and a few months ago after he tried to text me and ask if I was ""ready to try being friends"" I said no and deleted his number.  I don't regret that.

One thing you need to know about this breakup though: it happened months after I realized it was no longer worth it to stay, because I wanted him to be in a better mental state before I left.  He'd been in a pretty bad depression and had only just started therapy when I realized it wasn't worth it.  I wanted them to have a rapport with their therapist, trust them, get back to feeling somewhat normal before I did something like this.  The night I ended it was still painful, but my worst fear didn't come true at least, and they had their friends to help them.

It's been months since I left him.  I'm happier, I moved out of my parent's home, I've got a decent job.  And now an unsaved number wants to meet up for coffee.

And a part of me wants to hurt them and ask ""who is this,"" and finally get the closure of really unloading on them everything they did to me.  But that kind of urge, the fact that when they were upset I would either have an urge to hurt them worse or just feel indifferent to their suffering, that's one of the reasons I left them.

But if I block the number then I'll be slamming the door on any closure I could get.

I'm not going to go with them for coffee.  Any communication will be over text only.  But I don't know if I should even do that much.",1,1729461063.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

I’m only on page 22, but the writing at a structural level is just painful to read. 

Descriptions of locations and character actions are plentiful and wholly unnecessary. Is it supposed to mirror a film script? There’s a reason novels are novels and scripts are scripts. Here’s an example:

> Abel offered him the plate with cookies. He took one cookie and another sip of coffee. He found himself lazily discussing film stars of old with Abel. The director knew everyone. Tristán always relished this kind of talk. The anecdotes and tales of decades past filled him with excitement.

There’s no complex sentence structure, the reader doesn’t need a blow-by-blow of eating cookies and drinking coffee, and why am I being explicitly told Tristán’s feelings about this conversation instead of being immersed in the conversation itself?

This approach would bother me less if the characters or the plot were interesting, but the characters have no mystery because they tell me exactly what they’re feeling and thinking and the plot has no intrigue. So far the plot is that Montserrat needs supplementary income to help her sister with cancer treatment and Tristán is waiting for the phone company to install his phone. This is a horror novel! Where’s the horror atmosphere?

I’m sorry if I’m harping on this book too much for only having read 22 pages, but this is just much lower than my expectations. If you’ve read it, is there any payoff for this style of writing? Do the characters or plot improve?

Is Moreno-Garcia publishing too many books too fast and would benefit from taking more time to revise and edit? I know this could very likely be publisher pressure as well.",6,1729461037.0,Fantasy,0,0.88,False

Dear Ex-Wife, Please Be Mine Again
1: Of Course A Divorce
Christiana’s POV.

The door to the lawyer's office closed behind me with a soft click. I had barely taken a step inside when the man behind the desk looked up from his papers, his expression serious and firm.

""Mrs. Davis, please take a seat. Your husband will join us shortly, but there are matters we need to discuss first,"" he said, gesturing to a chair in front of his imposing mahogany desk.

Curiosity ate at me as I settled into the chair. What could possibly be so urgent that Alex had summoned me here, to a lawyer’s office of all places? I watched the lawyer intently, waiting for him to continue.

He adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. ""Mrs. Davis, your husband, Alex, has proposed a divorce.""

My breath caught in my throat, and I stared at him, stunned. ""Good heavens, a divorce?"" I managed to say, my voice was shaky.

The lawyer nodded, his face was of professional detachment. ""I know this comes as a surprise to you, but that's what Alex wants.""

I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, each beat was of shock and disbelief that coursed through me. Divorce? Alex and I had our problems, sure, but I never imagined it would come to this.

The lawyer continued, detailing Alex's grievances like he was reading from a script. ""He has cited several reasons for this decision. Firstly, he feels there is a disconnection in your communication. He also mentioned disagreements on financial matters and the future direction of your lives together.""

My mind was racing, struggling to process his words. Alex and I had our spats, but were they really enough to end our marriage?

""And finally,"" the lawyer said, looking up to meet my eyes, ""he mentioned the issue of children. You have been unable to conceive after two years of marriage. Alex is a man of considerable wealth, a billionaire, and he desires heirs to continue his legacy.""

A sharp pain pierced my chest, and tears stung my eyes. The lawyer's words felt like daggers, each one driving deeper into my heart. That Alex could sit here and tell this man such intimate, painful details about our lives… It was almost too much to bear.

My hands trembled as I clasped them in my lap. I felt utterly betrayed, hurt beyond measure. The man I loved, the man I thought I knew, had laid bare our most private struggles and used them as reasons to end our marriage.

The lawyer paused, allowing the weight of his words to sink in. I struggled to compose myself, to fight back the tears that threatened to spill over. I couldn't believe it had come to this—my own husband, my Alex, seeking to end our life together because of something as tragic and uncontrollable as infertility.

I sat there, unable to speak, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts and emotions. The future I had envisioned, the love I thought was unbreakable, was crumbling before my eyes. How could he do this to me? To us?

The door to the lawyer's office opened with a quiet creak, and Alex stepped inside. My heart skipped a beat, and I rose from my chair, meeting his gaze with tear-filled eyes.

""A divorce,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""That's what you truly want?""

""Yes,"" Alex replied, his tone devoid of any remorse. He clenched and unclenched his jaw before continuing, ""I can't do it anymore. This whole marriage is suffocating.""

The words hit me like a sledgehammer, and I struggled to remain standing, my heart aching with a pain I had never known. ""There are rumors,"" I began, swallowing hard, ""that you're seeing Bianca Lewis, the celebrity, the fashion icon. Is that true?""

Alex didn't flinch. ""Yes. You and I drifted apart several months ago, although we did get intimate but I was never satisfied. So, I started seeing Bianca, and we've been together for six months. I must say she makes me feel whole.""

It was as if he had punched me in the face. The rumors I had dismissed as baseless were true. Alex had cheated on me. My chest felt like it was about to explode from the overwhelming agony. I had defended him, convinced he would never betray me, but now, hearing it from his own lips, I was shattered.

""How could you do this to me?"" I demanded, my voice breaking. ""I loved you, Alex. I sacrificed everything to be with you. And now you want to leave me?""

Alex's expression remained cold, almost indifferent. ""Don't even think about begging me because once a man has made up his mind, nothing else can change it.""

His words were like daggers, each one slicing deeper into my already wounded heart. The man I thought I knew, the man I had devoted my life to, stood before me as a stranger. The future I had dreamed of was slipping away, replaced by a painful reality I was unprepared to face.

I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and betrayal. This was not how it was supposed to be. The love that had once bound us now lay in ruins. Destroyed by his desire for a divorce to part ways with me.

The lawyer watched silently, his eyes flicking between us. I could feel the walls closing in, the air growing heavy with the finality of Alex's decision.

I wanted to scream, to lash out, to make him see the depth of the pain he was causing. But all I could do was stand there, my heart breaking into pieces.

I took several deep breaths, trying to steady my raging nerves. The air felt thick with tension, but I forced myself to remain calm. Meeting Alex's gaze with a newfound boldness, I said, ""You want a divorce? Fine. I'll give it to you.""

Turning to the lawyer, I held out my hand. ""Give me the documents.""

The lawyer hesitated for a moment, then handed over the papers. I could feel Alex's eyes on me as I signed each page with a steady hand, willing myself not to break down. I would not give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry.

With the final signature in place, I stood up and walked over to Alex, holding the signed documents out to him. ""I've given you what you want.""

Alex took the papers, his expression unreadable. ""You can have the mansion,"" he said after a moment. ""And Davis Enterprises, along with the estate in the Hamptons. Plus, $50 million as compensation for all your suffering throughout the years.""

The words hung in the air, a list of material possessions meant to ease the pain of a broken heart. But they meant nothing to me now.

""I don't want any of it,"" I said, my voice steady and clear. ""Keep your money, your properties, your company. They won't heal the hurt you've caused.""

2: Pain
As I approached our home, my heart sank at the sight of my belongings scattered outside. My clothes, shoes, and personal items were piled haphazardly on the lawn. My stomach churned as I saw Alex's mother, Margret , standing on the porch, ordering the maids and butlers to throw my things out.

Margret never liked me. She always found ways to belittle me and poison Alex against me. Seeing her now, orchestrating my public humiliation, was almost too much to bear.

""Why are you doing this?"" I demanded, stepping forward, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and despair.

Margret's eyes flashed with contempt. Before I could react, she slapped me hard across the cheek. The sting was sharp and immediate, but what hurt more was the malice in her eyes. ""You dare talk? After everything you've put my son through?""

I chuckled bitterly, even as tears filled my eyes. ""I stood by Alex. I defended him, supported him through everything. You know nothing about what we've been through.""

Margret sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. ""Take your things and get the hell out. Barren woman, who knows nothing other than squandering my son's money. Alex already divorced you and he's bringing in someone better.""

The words were like knives, each one cutting deeper than the last. But I forced myself to smile through the tears. ""It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?""

Margret 's face twisted with rage. ""You ungrateful little wretch. You were never good enough for my son. You're a failure as a wife, and you couldn't even give him a child. Now he's found someone worthy of him, someone who isn't a useless drain on his fortune.""

The maids and butlers watched in silence, their eyes filled with pity and discomfort. Margret continued to berate me, each insult cutting deeper than the last. “You think you’re something special? You’re nothing! My son deserves someone who can give him a real family, not a useless woman like you.”

Her harsh words hit me ever harder, with the eyes of the servants on us, witnessing my humiliation. 

""You're a disgrace, Christiana. A parasite who latched onto my son's success. You have no place here. Get out and never come back.""

I stood there, absorbing every harsh word, every insult, but refusing to let her see me break. I knew this was her moment of triumph, the culmination of years of disdain and bitterness. And in that moment, I realized I had to walk away with my head held high, for myself and for the life growing inside me.

“I’m leaving,” I said quietly, gathering what little dignity I had left. “But know this, Margaret. I loved your son with all my heart, and I sacrificed everything for him. One day, he’ll realize the mistake he made. And when that day comes, I hope you can live with yourself.”

With that, I turned and began collecting my things, tears streaming down my face but my mind was already made up. I would rebuild my life, far away from this toxic one.

Margaret's harsh words echoed in my mind, but I couldn't dwell on them. I needed to find a place for my things and figure out my next move. I pulled out my phone and began calling people I thought I could rely on.

""Hi, it's Christiana. I need a place to store some of my things temporarily. Could you help me out?"" I asked, my voice trembling slightly.

There was a pause on the other end before the voice responded, ""I'm really sorry, Christiana, but I can't help you right now. It's... it's complicated.""

My heart sank, but I tried to stay hopeful. I made another call. ""Hey, it's Christiana. I’m in a bit of a situation. Can I bring some of my stuff over?""

""Christiana, I heard about what happened. I don’t think it's a good idea. I’m sorry,"" the response came, tinged with discomfort.

Each call ended the same way, and the realization hit me hard: Alex had already been around, telling everyone his version of the story. In their eyes, I was the villain. No one wanted to help me. 

I tried to access my bank account, hoping to at least get a hotel room for the night. But when I swiped my card at an ATM, the screen flashed, “Transaction declined.” I tried again, and the same message appeared. Panic rising, I logged into my account on my phone, only to see a message: “Account frozen.”

“No, no, no,” I whispered, my hands shaking. Alex had frozen my accounts. He had access to them and now, he had taken everything. I was in pain, with absolutely nothing left. My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice. I had no money, no home, and no one to turn to.

As night fell, I wandered aimlessly through the streets, clutching my bags and hoping to find somewhere safe. The city lights blurred through my tears, and the cold air bit at my skin. I felt utterly lost, each step heavier than the last.

Suddenly, I felt a rough hand grab my arm. “Hey! What’s going on?” I cried out, but another hand yanked my bags away. Panic surged through me as I saw two men running off with everything I had left.

“No! Please, stop! Help!” I screamed, but my cries echoed unanswered through the empty streets. The men disappeared into the night, leaving me with nothing but my purse and phone.

I collapsed onto the pavement, sobbing uncontrollably. My entire world had crumbled, and I was left alone in the darkness. I felt utterly broken, my spirit crushed by the weight of my circumstances.

With trembling hands, I fumbled for my phone in my purse. It was the only lifeline I had left, the only connection to the world outside this nightmare. Through tear-blurred vision, I dialed a number, praying for someone, anyone, t

o answer and offer a tad of hope in this dark hour.

3: Pregnant? Incredulous!
Two weeks had passed since my world had crumbled to dust. My days were now spent scrubbing floors and sweeping at a dingy restaurant, the smell of grease and old food clinging to my clothes. 

My boss, a perpetually sour-faced woman named Karen, took every opportunity to remind me of my fall from grace. We were only two waiters and one was on leave.

""Christiana, get over here and clean this mess!"" Karen barked, pointing to a spill near the kitchen. ""And hurry up! Table three is waiting for their drinks!""

The restaurant was overwhelming, with rowdy customers demanding my attention. I rushed from table to table, my hands red and raw from constant cleaning, trying to keep up with the never-ending stream of orders and complaints.

""Miss! Where's my coffee?"" a gruff man called out, waving his hand impatiently. ""And bring some more napkins while you're at it!""

As I hurried to fulfill the customers' requests, the sound of the television caught my ear. The news anchor's voice cut through the chaos, and my heart sank as I recognized the topic of discussion.

""In today's celebrity news, billionaire Alex Davis has finalized his divorce from his wife Christiana Davis and is now officially with fashion icon Bianca.""

I froze, the tray in my hands trembling. On the screen, images and videos of Alex and Bianca flashed by, the two of them looking every bit the perfect couple. They smiled for the cameras, their hands entwined, their eyes filled with a happiness that felt like a knife twisting in my heart.

The customers around me began to chatter, their voices blending into a cacophony of judgment and gossip.

""Did you hear about Alex Davis? Finally got rid of that wife of his,"" one man said with a laugh. ""Can't blame him, though. She couldn't even give him a kid.""

""Yeah, I heard she was pretty useless,"" another woman chimed in. ""Bianca is a much better match for him. She's gorgeous and successful.""

My face burned with humiliation and pain as I listened to their cruel words. They didn't know they were talking about me, the woman who was serving them. Each comment was like a dagger, cutting deeper into my already shattered heart.

""I feel bad for that ex-wife of his,"" a lone voice spoke up. I turned to see a middle-aged woman shaking her head. ""Imagine how she must feel, seeing her husband move on so quickly. It’s just so sad.""

Karen's shrill voice snapped me back to reality. ""Christiana, stop dawdling and get back to work! Those tables won't serve themselves!""

I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced myself to keep moving. As I continued to serve the oblivious customers, their words echoed in my mind, each one a reminder of my perceived failures and the life I had lost.

The image of Alex and Bianca haunted me, their smiles mocking my misery. How had things gone so wrong? How could the man I had loved so deeply, sacrificed so much for, move on so easily? 

Oh, I almost forgot. She had always been there.

The pain was almost unbearable, but I held myself together, refusing to let them see me break. 

As the night wore on, the news segment continued, detailing the glamorous life Alex and Bianca were now living. I scrubbed the floors harder, trying to erase the hurt with every stroke of the brush. But no amount of scrubbing could cleanse the ache in my heart.

By the time my shift ended, I was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I sank into a chair in the back of the restaurant, the weight of the day pressing down on me. Tears welled up in my eyes, but I blinked them back. I couldn't afford to cry. Not here, not now.

Instead, I took a deep breath and stared at my reflection in the dirty window. I was stronger than this.

No one had come to my aid when I needed it most. Friends turned their backs, and even those I thought I could rely on had chosen sides, believing the lies Alex spread about me. It was Karen, the hot-tempered owner of the small restaurant, who took pity on me. She offered me food and shelter in exchange for my work.

Scrubbing floors and serving unruly customers was a far cry from the life I had known. Each day was a struggle to hold onto my dignity while performing menial tasks, enduring Karen's never-ending criticism, and facing the pitying or judgmental glances of those who had heard the news when they by chance ran into me.

…

One afternoon, after enduring another grueling shift, I found myself staring into the bathroom mirror, my reflection a ghost of the woman I once was. 

My eyes, red and puffy from lack of sleep and constant tears, stared back at me. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit me hard, and I barely made it to the toilet before retching violently. My body trembled, and I felt weak and lightheaded as I sat on the cold tile floor, trying to regain my composure.

Two hours later, I found myself in a sterile doctor's office, the harsh fluorescent lights making everything seem even more surreal. Dr. Patel, a kindly older man with a gentle demeanor, had just returned with the results of my blood test. 

""Ms. Christiana,"" he began, his voice calm but serious, ""you're pregnant.""

The words hung in the air, almost incomprehensible. ""Pregnant?"" I echoed, my voice barely more than a whisper. ""How... how can that be? I was told I couldn't have children.""

Dr. Patel gave me a sympathetic look. ""Sometimes, the body can surprise us. But I assure you, the test is accurate. You're approximately three weeks along.""

I shook my head, struggling to process the information. ""No, there must be some mistake. I was told I was barren. This can't be right."" My hands trembled as I clutched at the chair's armrests, trying to anchor myself in this revelation.

He handed me the test results, the undeniable proof staring up at me in black and white. I traced the words with my finger, still in shock. Pregnant. How could this be?

""You're sure?"" I asked again, my voice breaking. 

Dr. Patel nodded, his expression gentle but firm. ""I'm certain, Ms. Christiana. Congratulations.""

Congratulations? The word felt foreign, almost mocking. I was at a loss for words. Pregnant with Alex's child. The last time we had been intimate was ten days before the divorce. It hadn't been an act of passion or love; it had felt more like a duty to him. He didn't hold me lovingly, didn't kiss me. His mind had clearly been elsewhere. And now, despite everything, I was pregnant?

I left the doctor's office in a daze, the world around me feeling distant and unreal. The irony of the situation was overwhelming. 

Alex had divorced me because I couldn't give him children, and now, he

re I was, carrying his child. The universe had a cruel sense of humor.

4: Meeting Again
The plane's engines hummed softly as I settled into my first-class seat, looking out the window at the clouds. 

Five years had passed since I left this city, heartbroken and destitute. Now, I was returning as a successful businesswoman, the CEO of a thriving empire known nationwide. My brands, ranging from high-end fashion to eco-friendly cosmetics, were household names. The transformation felt surreal.

My personal assistant, Grace, was busy typing away on her laptop a few seats down. Beside her, my security team ensured that everything was in order. They were all part of the group that had become essential in my new life. My success had brought wealth, influence, and an entirely new set of responsibilities.

Among my group, however, the most important were my children. Ethan and Emma, my five-year-old twins, were currently engaged in a heated debate, their voices carrying through the luxurious cabin. They approached me, their faces filled with the intensity of their argument.

""Mom, tell Emma she's wrong!"" Ethan demanded, his blue eyes sparkling with frustration and excitement.

""No, Mom, Ethan is wrong!"" Emma retorted, her hands on her hips and a stubborn pout on her lips.

I couldn't help but smile at their antics. They were both so smart and full of life, each with their own unique personality. Ethan was logical and methodical, while Emma was creative and fiercely independent.

""Okay, okay, calm down,"" I said, holding up my hands. ""What's the argument about this time?""

""Ethan says that the capital of Australia is Canberra, but I said it's Sydney,"" Emma explained, her eyes wide with determination.

I chuckled softly. ""Ethan is right, sweetheart. The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney.""

Emma's face fell, her pout deepening. ""But Sydney is the biggest city. It should be the capital.""

I pulled her close, kissing the top of her head. ""Sometimes the biggest city isn't the capital. It's a bit confusing, but it's a good thing to learn.""

Ethan beamed with pride, while Emma sulked for a moment before finally giving in with a sigh. ""Okay, Ethan, you win.""

""Thanks, Mom,"" Ethan said, giving me a quick hug before running back to his seat, victorious.

Emma lingered, her disappointment still evident. I cupped her cheek, looking into her eyes. ""You know, you were right about Sydney being the biggest city. That's something special too.""

She smiled up at me, her earlier defeat forgotten. ""Thanks, Mom.""

As she scampered back to her seat, I leaned back and took a deep breath. Moments like these reminded me of how far we had come. From the depths of despair to the heights of success, my children were my greatest achievement and my most precious treasure.

Returning to the city I had left behind felt like closing a chapter and beginning a new one. My heart swelled with pride and anticipation. This time, I was not the broken woman who had walked away with nothing. I had everything which made my life whole.

Five years ago, my world had turned upside down. Discovering I was pregnant after Alex left me was both a blessing and a challenge. With no family to turn to—being an orphan meant I was truly alone—I had to muster every ounce of strength I had left.

I saved up what little money I earned from scrubbing floors and sweeping at Karen's restaurant. It was tough work, but Karen's kindness and the roof over my head kept me going. Every night, I counted my savings, dreaming of a better life for my unborn children. I knew staying there was not an option; I needed a fresh start, away from the pain and humiliation of the past.

With enough money saved, I left Karen’s place and moved to a new city, far from the memories that haunted me. I found a small, rundown apartment and started from scratch. My first venture was a tiny boutique—barely more than a closet—where I sold handmade dresses and accessories. The work was grueling, and the profits were meager, but I poured my heart into it.

Pregnancy was no walk in the park, especially without anyone to lean on. I faced the morning sickness, the doctor visits, and the overwhelming fear of the unknown alone. But every kick, every flutter from my babies gave me the strength to keep going. When the time came, I gave birth to Ethan and Emma. They were my miracles, my reason for fighting harder than ever before.

Raising twins on my own was a monumental task. Sleepless nights, endless feedings, and the constant juggle between motherhood and building a business tested me in ways I never imagined. But giving up was never an option. I wanted to prove to myself and to the world that I could rise above the challenges.

The boutique grew slowly but steadily. Word of mouth spread, and soon, my unique designs caught the eye of a few influential people. Orders started pouring in, and I reinvested every penny into expanding my business. I moved into a bigger space, hired staff, and launched my brand nationwide. The trials were many, but so were the triumphs.

Ethan and Emma grew up in the midst of it all, always understanding that their mother was working to create a better life for them. They were my greatest cheerleaders, their laughter and love my daily inspiration.

Now, as I sat on that flight back to the city I had left in shambles, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of pride. I had built an empire from nothing. My brands were synonymous with elegance and innovation, and I had secured a future for my children that I had once only dreamed of.

…

The flight finally landed, and the hum of activity around us grew louder as we prepared to disembark. I straightened my jacket and turned to my team, giving them last-minute instructions.

""Grace, make sure the car service knows we’re on our way. Sam, coordinate with the hotel about our late check-in. Lisa, double-check the kids' bags,"" I said, my voice clear and authoritative.

My personal maid, Lisa, nodded and moved to check Ethan and Emma's bags. The children, bubbling with excitement, were being particularly giggly and playful. Ethan kept trying to tickle Emma, who squealed in delight, her laughter ringing through the cabin.

As we moved through the airport, I kept an eye on them, smiling at their antics. They were truly the light of my life, their joy infectious even in the midst of a hectic schedule. We made our way to the waiting area where our cars were supposed to be, my team forming a protective circle around us.

""Mommy, look! I'm a superhero!"" Ethan shouted, darting ahead with his arms outstretched like an airplane. Emma, not to be outdone, tried to catch up, her little legs pumping furiously.

""Ethan, slow down!"" I called out, but it was too late. In his enthusiasm, Ethan collided with a man surrounded by his own group of P.A.s and bodyguards.

The man looked down at Ethan, who stared up at him with wide eyes, momentarily speechless. I hurried over, my heart racing.

""I'm so sorry,"" I began, but my words trailed off as the man removed his sunglasses and called my name.

""Christiana?""

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. 

There, standing in front of me, was Alexander Davis. My ex-hu

My husband/SIL comes from a pretty well off family and I grew up in somewhat of a middle class working family. We never really struggled but we never had extravagant things either. So obviously, my husband and I have different views on money because of the way we grew up.

So here is the issue. Whenever the my husband, SIL and I go out for dinner, my expectation is that we just pay for our own meals. However, lately my SIL has been doing this weird thing of forgetting her wallet and we are forced to pay for her. It’s getting to the point where I’m suspicious that she’s doing this on purpose. 

She never offers to pay her share back but instead suggests that she will pay for the next dinner… but she never does. I’ve discussed this issue with my husband several times. He thinks it’s annoying too but he ends it with “what’s $50? I’m not going to ask her to pay me back, I can afford it, etc.” He works as a chiropractor and makes decent money, but I’m on EI right now (just for one more month, but it’s still not much) and then after that I don’t get paid for 6 months (decided to extend my leave at work). We also have our son’s big birthday party coming up, a friend’s destination wedding in the new year, and we generally want to save for our mortgage and son’s future. 

Sure it’s $50 this time, but then another time it’s $10, then $40… it really adds up. And not only that, it’s the principle. If this was me, I would be so embarrassed to do this to another person. Seriously - If you keep forgetting your wallet, there are ways around it. there’s Apple Pay, set up reminders, idc just at least try to DO SOMETHING about it. My husband enables this behaviour by not saying anything and it pisses me off. Here are some other examples:

1. We were all about to leave the house for coffee (cousins, the 6 of us) and she announces “I’m not bringing my card, who’s paying” like wtf so rude and off putting. Go get your card and pay for yourself. 
2. We went out to dinner with my sister (is in school, doesn’t have a job) at a restaurant that only takes cash/debit. I reminded her beforehand abt that and when she shows up, she puts on this act that she forgot her wallet. My husband and I only brought enough cash for ourselves so my sister in law went to pay with her debit card for all of us. We told her we would pay her back. SIL asks us if we could etransfer/venmo my sister HER  portion and that she would pay for our next dinner. Why can’t you pay her back yourself???? And then she proceeds to say “who’s counting pennies?” I raised my eyebrow at that comment… cause in this economy?? 

I understand we’re family and we should have each other’s backs but she does this ALL THE TIME. My husband says I shouldn’t be confrontational about it or ruin our relationship over it but I’m at my wits end. She’s already ruining our relationship by doing this.

So WIBTAH if I went against my husbands wishes and said something to her?

Call this a mixture of a vent and an AITA post.
I (25F) have been living out of home for nearly 3 years now. My parents live 5+ hours away from me by car. I moved for my job which could not be done where my parents live.
When I first moved away most of my leave was used going back to visit them and my friends, with only the odd holiday away or weekend away to see friends in other location. Gradually, those visits have been less frequent as I have become more settled in the town that I live in which has meant less trips back to visit them. I also find talking on the phone/texting quite exhausting and don’t feel like I need that constant communication to know I am loved/valued by another person. In saying that my mum does text me A LOT and I usually reply daily if not every second day. I have never felt the need to reply to messages instantly.
Another important fact is that in the past year I also started dating someone, meaning my life had become more intertwined with theirs, I have gone on holidays away with them multiple times this year. This is my first serious relationship and the first serious relationship of any of my siblings or I. My parents have never been big on pushing relationships or talking about relationships in my life. 
In the past couple of weeks I have had a few heated discussions with them. One came off the back of a visit where my partner and I nearly broke up. Everything got resolved and we are happier and better than ever but my parents were present for the emotional rollercoaster of the few days, saw me sad and instantly made my partner the villain in the situation - one which I am happy to admit I made mistakes as well - one which is my partner never felt welcome when my parents were visiting or with me, and that they always felt like they would get in the way.
In a more recent conversation I was told that I was not respecting them because there were times I would fly away on holidays, have a 3-4 hour layover in my parents city and not tell them. This would happen on a work day but I was accused for being disrespectful for not telling them if they wanted to come and meet me at the airport or have coffee. 
There are more examples I can give, but for the sake of not extending the post any further I will leave it here. 
Essentially, I feel like I am in the right to live my life without always having to double check my decisions for their approval. I feel I have kept good contact with them, and in contrast they are constantly trying to keep in contact with me. They often try to force me to extend a weekend away with the excuse of ‘using leave’ or ‘using sick leave’ when there are aspects of my job that are timely and it is also a job which cannot be done remotely.

The end, the apocalypse, the final days of the world as we know it. The coffee’s hot, I sip it slowly and consider my alternatives. The thought of surviving has always been mankind’s highest priority, even if it means that you must obliterate your enemy. An instinct that has led us to this, to the brink of our own annihilation.

A syringe, an inhaler, and a handful of pills, all neatly organized next to my coffee. An assortment of drugs, various substances that I need to live. My kind will not survive the apocalypse, it’s just not possible. Who will produce the drugs? Who can make them at home, and even if they could, would all substances be available? How long can I stock them? Drugs that I need daily, and sometimes twice, how long will it take before I run out? And, what happens when I run out?

The different thoughts pass through my head as I read about prepping. Man will do anything to survive, anything, even if it means spending time in a shelter. Even if it means for all time to come. It makes me think, how long would I survive?

As the doomsday comes closer, I feel no fear. The thought of a swift death, swallowed by the mushroom cloud, seems a lot more pleasant than what to come in the bunker. In the blink of an eye, I will no longer feel the agony that my body treats me to. 

 Prepping, a method of surviving, or a method to prolong my suffering? I imagine the horrors my body will put me through, symptom after symptom, the body’s way of showing that something is wrong. Once I stop medicating, my body will become my enemy. An enemy attacking me from within, with no way of battling it. An enemy worse than the one putting me in the bunker.

About 1.5 months ago, I met a guy (30M) off a dating app. Our connection was pretty instant. I was bowled over by his passionate and caring nature - we went on two dates and were texting and calling almost constantly after that. The chemistry was great. The problem is I was travelling for about 3 weeks after that, but we kept in touch over video calls, and were really excited to see each other when back. He had started talking about a future together and I started getting attached to that idea - though a part of me knew this was a bit too soon and we both agreed we should take time to learn about each other.

It's important to understand that I am not a person who feels romantic/sexual attraction like this usually. I've always been all over the place with being non binary/confused about my orientation, but with him there was a deep sense of attachment and knowing. My body and soul were lit up. I am smiling, sure, confident - not in a giddy way but the calm knowing of being by someone you're meant to be with. I never want to go on another date after this. 

That being said, there were some red flags I had been able to see by this time, but I attributed this to the cons of a passionate personality and he also acknowledged that he had been through pretty traumatizing relationships. Trust was a big issue for him. Though we had not had the chat about exclusivity, he started getting mad if I talked about going to parties and didn't disclose who it was with in detail. Though I resisted at first finding this overbearing, I realized I wanted to make him feel comfortable and build trust so I started communicating more and promised my social scenes would include him and be completely transparent going forward. I could see myself adapt to his needs in the relationship but was a little alarmed that he threatened to break up because he was so triggered - it made me feel shamed/blackmailed though there were no intentions on my part to hookup with anyone and I cried about it and he apologized profusely. I felt on some level that these incidents were rushing things along for me a bit more than I would have liked.

When I came back, he treated me like a princess - picking me up from the airport, feeding me, if I said I needed something he would have it ready. Now comes the second red flag. He assumed we would have sex the moment I returned which I was not ready for. I've had some grief in my past with physical intimacy. I need lots of trust in the other person and emotional closeness + wanted our first time to be special. For him, he later clarified, it has always happened in a flow and women have never pulled the stops at just making out, so he assumed that is what it was.

So I said no sex, though things would get very heated, right before he tried to enter me. This happened 3-4 times in 2 days. He tells me how frustrating it is and I quote ""for guys"" to be stopped at the last moment and that if I wanted to take my time I should just tell him that. In my experience he also starts to be a little cold at this point, which starts to make me feel vulnerable AF. (Eg. Saying I need not pressure myself so much cuz we have time to think about the future- which made me feel he was getting second thoughts though he later clarified he was trying to take pressure off me).

Btw this is the fourth time I'm actually meeting him if we don't count the video calling. I text him I definitely just want to cuddle tonight - no sex - he says of course. I go to his place for the night. Some of his friends and acquaintances are over and I find his behavior a little odd (not introducing me as his gf, looking at me funny when I'm trying to socialize - just no affection).

When lying together that night I have a bad feeling (I acknowledge could be my own fears of abandonment popping their head but there was also a gut instinct that something had changed.) He acknowledges the energy is different too  - and starts to focus on the reasons for our disconnect (eg our diff backgrounds.) Long story short I feel cold lying next to this man. I turn to the side and try to sleep. He then tries to make out and initiate sex. In that moment I feel is the only warmth I'm going to get out of him + maybe it's his love language so I say yes. But at the very moment of him trying to enter me knowing I had said no on text - I kinda snap and say I think you're just trying to get laid with me and the fact that you would even initiate it makes me feel awful.

All this guy has to offer next is the words that I cockblocked him yet again, that he couldn't understand how I was even thinking in that moment and that he thought we were both having fun. He said he couldn't believe how indecisive I was.

I just stare at him. I say I'm going to leave now and try to get a cab. He says if you create a scene it is over and that it is his biggest red flag that someone could take drama from the bedroom outside to the world. (It was 2 am and there's no one outside I am just trying to get home.) So I sit, try to have a conversation, and he says he has nothing to offer - that I seem like such a complicated person, and that it's not like he was trying to force me. 

I know it's impossible for me to stay with him and even for this relationship to continue with such massive red flags. He follows me downstairs to the cab absolutely freaked out in his own way (later he tells me a psycho ex of his would pull everyone in his life into her meltdowns including his office people). I try to save the relationship one last time by saying I could still cancel the cab and that I had some sexual trauma (the first I'm mentioning of it) and he says there's no way we could save things after my behavior which was the ultimate red flag and trumped anything he had done, and that he was going to call the cab himself if I cancelled, and that I could quote ""keep my trauma"" to myself.

Over the next day I am miserable but he doesn't text, I've told my mom/friends about him and they all say I deserve better. I'm also of the mindset at 32 that I am not waiting around anymore for guys to change their mind about me, I'm here to find my person. So I go on a few dates with another man (within 2 days of this), and he's very respectful and caring. I spend Thanksgiving with him and it's very pleasant and cute, but I find myself constantly missing the deep connection I felt with Guy1. Though I haven't focused on it but it genuinely felt like my place in the world was beside him. I felt a new version of myself - affectionate, confident, no longer distracted by doubt. I felt sure he was my person.

Then he texts me. He says he's been miserable, as if a part of him is missing. And I know because it's the way it has felt for me too. I agree to meet him over a coffee for him to clarify things and I am just sitting there smiling that I know deep in my gut I  have met my person. He explains things that were on his mind and that he was so sorry he had not listened to my trauma - talks about that stalker of an ex and that he had been suicidal for a bit cuz of her. He says he wants to give us another shot.

That's when I make the mistake of telling him I need time because I've been on dates with another guy. He asks how they have been, particularly, if we have been physical. I say yes, but it's not the same.

He then proceeds go cold again saying his jealousy, insecurity were insurmountable and that he just couldn't be open minded about me being with someone else. He says I must have not been attached if I could move on so quickly instead of waiting for him. When I tell him I said I couldn't meet him yesterday because I didn't want to cancel the date, he loses it and says it is over, again. So I've been dumped again now.

But I miss him and want advice on whether this is worth investing energy/efforts to get him back.

TLDR- Met a guy who didn't respect my boundaries and got triggered and dumped me for speaking up - then dumped me again after I moved on - is it worth taking the time to get to know each other and amend this as I usually don't feel attachment like this?",1,1729460144.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
1g89qx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g89qx2/bad_birthday/,Bad birthday ,"So today is my birthday, 35th. 

I really like birthdays in general, I always decorate the house when it's someone's birthday, baking cakes, putting in advance a lot of thought what to give as a present, to be really personalized etc.

On my birthdays I always did something nice, even if I was alone I didn't mind just walking in the city, having some coffee and cake, going for good food, visiting some events around or even a little walk in beautiful autumn scenery. 

My husband is also quite aware of this, we are together for 7years now. Most of the time we went for a nice walk somewhere, sightseeing or hiking and nice dinner somewhere, on some occasions just staying home, eating cakes and cooking together, playing some board or card games etc. even few years ago during covid times when we both were sick we managed to have some fun. 
Not this year.
2weeks ago we had the idea to go somewhere in the area and have a nice dinner. I was pretty much looking for it, but unfortunately last week he got sick. 
So today when I was waking up he was already doing something in the kitchen, I was thinking he might be putting up some happy birthday sings or up to something, as I always do for him, bit later I went out, but there was nothing, but him sleeping on the couch. I was like alright, that's fine and let him sleep to rest his flu out. Like an hour later he came back to the bedroom, said a reaally low volume not really enthusiastic happy birthday and was just laying around with his phone. When it came to breakfast, low key I was hoping he offers to make something together, but I just ended up making my own and he making his own. Which was already disappointing and just sad as for years it's never been like that - again, not even when we had covid. After breakfast me cleaning up the mess and then just awkward silence. It was also time to take the dog for a walk, I assumed he doesn't feel like having a walk, and he confirmed so I ended up walking the dog alone for 1.5hours, which wasnt bad with sunny autumn weather, but felt quite lonely tbh, at some point I was even close to cry. 
After arriving home, his parents joined us with a small cake and some presents, it felt nice but somehow felt just weird. Like husband being distant and bored, just physically being there. I understand he is feeling sick, but even the willingness or showcasing some interest or a tiny bit of effort that it's my birthday.   After their parents left (like 20mins later), my husband just layed down on the couch with his phone and not much later fallen asleep. 
For me it was pretty much unclear what's happening, he didn't say a thing, only the night before I wanted to bake a cake he said I should just let myself be surprised tomorrow and saying his mama already baked one so I shouldn't. Honestly after this I thought there is something small might be planned, and was just looking around for the clues or some information, but the surprise was that there was nothing. No movies together,  no games, nothing. Me sitting outside alone or in the bedroom and him just laying around watching videos on his phone.
To be clear, I was not expecting to go for a trip or dinner, I was sure that our plans we had in mind is already off table, but at least some kind words or at least a hug would have been feeling nice. I would have appreciated some straightforward communication, just chillaxing and watching movies together, even he is sleeping though it. Not being left alone clueless. I ended up just crying in my office and he didn't even shown up or look for me for like 3hours, when he did, he was wondering what's my issue as he seriously doesn't understand. When explaining I feel really left alone on birthday and would have appreciated some kindness, it was like he is not even listening, I felt totally gaslighted ""that I have a problem with him being sick"" which is not true, I never pushed or pressured to do anything. It would have been nice just to been celebrated. ",1,1729460142.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

How many of you blend for espresso or buy pre blended beans for espresso. 

And I get it. Research. Play around with with it. And I am. I think I'm going to pid the machine eventually.

Over the last couple of years I've been having a weird thing with my urination. It doesn't happen that often and usually only at home. When I wake up at night or maybe have been sitting for a while and get up to pee, I'll sometimes just pee my pants before I get to the bathroom. It's not like I feel an insane urge and just can't hold it anymore. While I will have a slight urge, it feels manageable, but there's no controlling the pee that will come out. It just flows of its own accord.

I also don't feel like my pelvic floor muscles are even engaging when that happens. It doesn't feel like when you have to pee so badly you clench your pelvic floor and cross your legs. None of that helps. There's no stopping the flow. It never happens at work or when I'm out and about, only at home. I'm wondering if it's because when I'm at home, I wait longer to go, but I don't think so. 

I only have one cup of coffee a day and drink water the rest of the day. No other caffiene. I haven't seen a pelvic floor specialist and haven't discussed it with my doctor, but I will. I'm just curious if anyone else has delt with this and if they found a solution? Pelvic floor exercises? What? I don't think I have an issue with vaginal atrophy, because things seem to be working fine in that area.

This is my story.","Hello! First time posting here! actually I thought that i should do this for a long time now, but since I am home now because of a fever, and I have nothing else to do, i read a lot on this subreddit and thought that I'd share my experience. I would be very happy if you could stay until the end, and i apologize in advance, this is going to be a long post.

  
I met my (20m) first Girlfriend (20f at the time), let's call her Lisa, through my job at a local Bar. she started working there about 2 months after her flatmate in August 2022. I have been working there for a while at the time and was really happy with everything in life at the moment. 

We had a few shifts together and soemtimes she would flirt with me, though i wouldn't realize until weeks after. Everybody at the bar started shipping us but i didn't really think much of it since i have never been the lucky person when it comes to girls. But after a while i really started to develop a crush on her. We sometimes went out to drink coffee and in the last week of October we went costume shopping. She wanted to dress up as a Horse together with me, one of us would be the head and front legs, the other would display the hind legs, and tail (i hope you understand what i mean). I was aware at this point that she had a crush on me, but i denied the costume idea, since i didn't really have the money at the moment. Even though she was a bit dissapointed, she understood and was okay with it.

On Halloween, the whole crew was at the bar, and she was aswell. i was dressed as Elton John in his Iconic Dodgers costume (which I already had at home) and Lisa was Uma Thurman from the movie ""Pulp Ficition"". The evening went by in a rush, with a bit of flirting and gentle touching. When the bar closed at 02.00 AM, everybody was really tired and wanted to go home. Then the  only people remaining were me and her. We decided to go to the club next door, went dancing and after a while we sat down to have a drink and chat. At this point she was a bit tired and laid down on the bench we were sitting on, and i just thought ""fuck it, imma do it."" and leaned over to kiss her. We made out for a while before deciding to go back to her place. We came together 3 days after.

  
Fast forward to April 2024. 

it was the saturday before Easter Sunday, which Lisa would spend at her mom's place, so I wouldn't be able to see her then. I decided to bring her flowers and chocolates, and when she opened the door I immediately realized that something was off. I was trying to brush it off as just her being tired or not in a good mood. I gave her the flowers and chocolates, but she wasn't at all thrilled. We sat down on her bed to cuddle for a while until I asked what was wrong. She repeatedly told me that she doesn't want to talk about it right now, but i really wanted to know because i was starting to get a bad feeling. I started to ask her multiple things what it could be until i had nothing else in mind than ""Are you breaking up with me?"". She said yes. I immediately started to cry my fucking eyes out. Simultaneously to me crying she also started to cry. I started to hyperventilate, she took me in her arms and somehow managed to slow my breathing. We just laid there for a while, both crying, both snotting onto each others shirts, both hugging. After an hour of weeping and otherwise silence, i asked her why. She told me that she just can't really do it anymore. She is studying architecture at university, which is a lot, and she just cannot focus on a relationship and university at the same time and manage to give both things her everything. She was also not happy with my situation. See, i am still living with my parents, while she has moved out in 2021. She understood that my financial situation did not allow me to move out, and that i will as soon as a position opened up at my dream job, to which i managed to pass the month long application process with a number of assessments. She was saying that I sometimes wasn't acting mature enough for my age. Waiting for an opportunity to just come to me instead of taking matters into my own hands (which is true, i have to give her that). And most importantly, she didn't really have the impression, that no matter how much we loved each other, we didn't really share a life. 

After we calmed down for a bit, she asked me if i wanted to spend the night, since it was already dark out. I turned down the offer, saying that I couldn't stay here in good conscience, knowing that in less than 20 hours i would walk out of her door and it would be over. 

I decided to pack my things. We shared a, what we thought would be our last, i love you and i walked out the door. I got a Taxi home, since my face was really swollen from all the crying, and i didn't want anyone to see me like this. on my way home i called my mom, told her all about it, she was sorry. Afterthat i called a close friend of mine, who lives in my area and asked him if he was free tonight since i needed distraction. He obviously heard that i wasn't okay, I explained to him, and he told me to come right away. We spent an hour talking about random stuff and then watched a movie. 

The next day I called Lisa, crying my eyes out on the phone, telling her that i miss her and begging that she would take me back and I would do better. She told me that she already made her decision, and she can't do that, but she agreed to meet me on Tuesday afternoon.

I had two full days to collect my thoughts, because i wanted to talk about it all in a less hectic manner. I got to her place, she made me coffee and we started talking. It didn't take long until we went to her room and started to make out. We slept with each other. We told ourselves that this was only natural since we were still in love and we both were really frustrated with everything happening. After we finished and got dressed again, she asked me if it could be possible for me to consider trying it all again. I told her that I do not think that this is a good idea, since i am pretty sure that nothing about my or her situation would change in the near future, and i was afraid that we would break up once again in a few months. We left the situation as it was.

May 2024

It has been 2 weeks since I'd seen her last, at her place. I was thinking about her constantly, crying, overthinking, should i have said yes to her suggestion? Was it the wrong call to deny the offer? Then one night, i had a nightmare. I was working at the bar, and she suddenly appeared with all her friends. The whole time all i did was fucking up at work, while she and her friends continued to laugh at me and make fun of me. I woke up sweating and crying. I needed to call her to tell her all about it. She told me that it was just a bad dream and she would never do that. And that i should relax. I asked her if I could see her next week to talk to her and also grab my remaining stuff i left at hers and she offered me to meet me on Thursday.

Then, the day before Thursday my nightmare from last week kinda became reality. I was having my shift at the Bar, when suddenly she walked in. We greeted each other with nothing but a hug. it felt so strange. I could feel how i got really nervous and shaky. I had a panic attack. My Boss sent me home after seeing how pale I was and told me to get some rest. Lisa accompanied me on my way to the subway. I asked her if it was still okay if i came tomorrow to which she said yes.

The next day I went to her place, and long story short, we somehow had sex again. Only this time we told each other that we should stop doing that because wver time we part ways after, it feels like a new breakup. Still, we decided that we just wouldn't leave it at that. we decided to keep this all a secret to avoid unnecessary chatter and gossip among our colleagues in order to give our relationship its last and final goodbye.

We somehow kept texting and talking like we used to when we were together. We both really enjoyed that. It was an intimate and familiar feeling, which he had withheld over the past few weeks. We came up with a plan, that on the friday of the following week, i would spend the night at her place, under the condition that her flatmate (who also worked at the bar) would stay the night at her Boyfriend's. We agreed that we would first meet at the Bar, and even though both of us did not have a shift this evening, it wouldn't be suspicious because a colleague of ours would celebrate her birthday that night. didn't really know if it would be possible for me to stay the night because she stopped texting me back for a while. When she then finally arrived she secretly texted me that the plan is going to work. I was beyond Happy. We spent about 2 Hours at the bar, until i i left first, and then waited about 15 minutes around the corner for her to come. When we got to her place we started ripping of each others clothes and probably had the best sex we ever had. Shortly after we fell asleep, in each others arms, like it used to be.

The next day, I stayed at her place until 04:00 PM, and we said that we want to spend a full weekend together for one last time. We obviously couldn't do it at her place, because of her flatmate, so we decided to rent an AirBnB for next weekend, from Thursday to Sunday, in another (very beatiful) part of our hometown.  

When the next and probably our last week together rolled around, I didn't really realize it. It was like nothing ever happened and I was looking forward to the weekend. On tuesday evening I was feeling really really horny. I texted her and tried to somehow steer the conversation into the direction of you know what. She seemed really into it and we continued with our spicy texts. 

The next day she asked if i could come over before i had to go to work. I of course said yes and was happy to see her. We had about 2 hours before i had to leave for work, and she quickly told me that she was still so turned on from last night, that she now wanted the real thing. Safe to say that sex saved my day that wednesday, because I was not at all in the mood for work.

Thursday, End of May 2024 

Our last weekend together. We checked into our AirBnB at around 02:00 PM. Those 4 Days were probably the most beautiful and at the same time sad days i have ever spent in my entire life. I have never felt so close to her before. We went on walks, to the cinema, went out for dinner, did a lot of stuff together that we both knew the other enjoyed. We explored the Area, went out for breakfast, slept together, laughed, talked, cuddled, showered together and did everything that we enjoyed so much over the last years.

On Sunday we parted ways for good. We went out for breakfast one last time. We both ordered our food, and after we finished she took out two sheets of paper and two pens. She wanted us both to write down all the things, we want to be, do or experience in the next few years, and keep that piece of paper, to remind ourselves, that we can do and should do better in life, and that sometimes it just takes time and determination to reach the things we want to accomplish. We both read each others list, then handed it back and packed our things. 

We walked to the train station from which we both had to go in the opposite direction from each other. We shared a final kiss, a final goodbye, and a final I love you. 



Thank you all for reading, there are still some thing i haven't told in this post but i will continue telling the aftermath of this month long breakup another time, because there are still a few things to tell. Thank you for your attention and patience with this long text.

What do I need to do in order to prevent this from happening ever again?,"My (24) boyfriend (26) has bit me (consensually) too hard twice in the past and my instinct was to hit him. I told him I would never do this again, and I did. I don’t know why I resort to violence when I’m harmed but I don’t ever want to hurt the person I’m dating and I am beside myself with guilt and sadness. 

I loathe being tickled because I know I’ll do whatever it takes to get the other person to stop. I told my boyfriend to stop several times but I was laughing so it seemed like I was enjoying it. I don’t think I verbally said “you’re hurting me” which is 100% my fault. I should’ve made it clearer that I was uncomfortable and in pain while he was tickling me so me hitting him caught him off guard and it scared him. He removed himself from the situation and we took time to ourselves. Later on we ended up in his car to continue getting coffee like we had planned on doing before I hit him. He said I am violent and abusive, which is when I lost my cool and yelled at said I’m not abusive, I was acting in self-defense. Things on my end spiraled out of control and I acted like a psychotic bitch. I defended myself and said I would never, EVER think about hurting him out of anger. I would never lay a hand on him, the only reason why I did this was because I was being hurt and I didn’t know what else to do. He said I could’ve pushed him, yelled at him to stop, or pretty much anything else. I agree. 

I’m not a violent person but my boyfriend thinks I am because of this. Now we’re on the verge of breaking up. 

How do I fix this part of me that resorts to hitting? How do I take a step back and realize putting your hands on someone isn’t okay no matter what the situation is? And how do I apologize without crying and using my emotions?

1g89cin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadows_of_Doubt/comments/1g89cin/great_game_dont_give_up_on_it_yet/,Great Game Don't Give Up On It Yet,"TLDR; Try a different approach to your case. Identifiy your leads and follow the trail.

For those who want to give up on this game, I hope this will help you.

I wouldn't give up just yet. You may just need to change your approach. I was almost ready to give up on this game, thinking my first case in sandbox mode didn't generate right or something. What happened was I went to a crime scene for a shooting in an apartment. I checked for all sorts of clues (journal entries, vmail, fingerprints, etc.). I got a potential description of killer from victims journal. Three different fingerprints (the victim, victim's spouse, and 3rd unidentified print), time of death, and cause of death (shot). I initially thought the killer was in the room with the victim at the time of murder. I was checking video cameras, going through the victim's address book, and even searching the victims job records thinking it had to be somebody present in the room connected to that 3rd set of prints, or someone the victim knew or worked with. All dead ends. I even thought it was the spouse at one point. He wrote an email staying he thinks his wife is cheating on him and he wants to kill her, and many witnesses said he was angry in the night of the murder. I tried to arrest him, and failed. For the life of me, I even just started trying to break into different businesses and get fingerprint records to match the third set of prints I found in the room. 

I wanted to give up, but for whatever reason, I thought there had to be something missing. By this point, I had a much better understanding of the mechanics of the game as far as the evidence board goes. I realized I had too much stuff on the board, not realizing your record of each citizen gets updated as you find identifying info on each of them. So I removed redundant info, and simplified my board. Just left location, time of death, cause of death, and the journal description on the board. 

At that point, the murderer struck a second time. Went to that crime scene. Same story as first, no real evidence except some bullet holes and a similar wound on the victim that matched the first. That's when it hit me, maybe I could track down the weapon. Found a black market dealer and discovered the type of ammunition is for a rifle. Realized the killer was killing from long range. So my initial assumption of the killer being in the same room was wrong. Checked sales ledger and got a name which lead me to an apartment. 

The apartment actually happened to be across the street from both victim's apartments with a direct line of sight into each. Apparently, the killer was just shooting his neighbors randomly from his living room apartment, go figure. Anyways, his prints certainly didn't match the third set of prints at the crime scene, but why would they if he never set foot at the actual scene? I was operating under the assumption in the beginning that you will only find prints of the residence and the killer at a crime scene, boy was I wrong. The other thing that lead me to think the killer was in the room was vmails and journals where the victim said she felt like she was being stalked and even gave brief descriptions of the her supposed stalker. I figured if she could describe him, she must have made contact with him at some point.

So, I searched the suspects house, no weapon, but I figured he had it on him. Confident he was my killer, I went to arrest him. Found him at his work place, cuffed him and when I told him he was arrested he basically admitted to the crime saying ""About time"" and ""I did it because for the first time I felt like I had power"". Filled out the case form and submitted it, and case solved. 

Things I Learned from this Case:

1) Don't jump to conclusions, just gather the facts. Just because a set of fingerprints is at a crime scene doesn't mean said person did it. They are only a suspect at best. Just because a suspect fits a description of the killer doesn't mean they are the killer. Just because a suspect appears to be angry, and wrote a angry email to there therapist about how they want to off someone doesn't mean they are the killer.

2) Means, motive, and opportunity. I'm not sure if motive really applies to this game beyond ""I felt like it"" and ""it's been 24 hours, time to murder"", but for certain means and opportunity are important. The killer has to be able to do the crime in game. Whether a stab in the back, or a sniper attack from a hotel room across the street, there is a logic to this game.

3) Identify your leads and simplify your investigation. Your investigation revolves around three things, location, time of death, and cause of death. Investigate those seen arriving or leaving the crime scene, victims address books, victims workplace, and victims residence. Profile, profile, profile! Sometimes the victim will have a journal and or vmail where they give a brief description of the suspect or maybe you'll find a clue in the newspaper. Use this to pick out who to take a closer look at.

4) A clue is just that, a clue. This ties back into number 1, don't assume, just investigate. Footprints, fingerprints, witness testimony, and other evidence can lead to dead ends. Cross it off, and investigate the next thing.

5) Take a coffee break, take up another job, or just turn off the game when you get stuck. Come back with a fresh mind.

6) Have fun! I know procedurally generated stuff can have its issues, but this game works for the most part. Aside from crashes and freezes (which are obvious when it happens), I would say, don't worry too much about whether a case didn't load the right evidence or something. Chances are, you just missed something and need to go back to the drawing board (or case board).",3,1729459077.0,Shadows_of_Doubt,2,0.8,False

Hoping for guidance as I know asking for a diagnosis would be silly. Feeling lost.,"Hi all! I am at a loss at this point. In October 2023 I went off of HBC after having an IUD since October 2017. I have not gotten a period since October 2017. Hormone testing reveals low progesterone, low estrodial, mid testosterone, high dhea. Bloodwork suggests liver/kidney function normal while thyroid function could use some work but nothing crazy low. GI Map back in November 2023 showed not enough healthy bacteria and overgrowth of bad bacteria but nothing again off the charts. Never directly did a breath test for SIBO so that will be my next test. 
Currently experiencing:
- Bloating. Used to be constant after ever meal. Was going days without a BM. Focused on gut health and eliminating UPFs. Eating every 4 hours ~2000 calories. Balancing fiber, fats, protein, carbs.  Now I go daily, but don’t always feel complete. Have to start every morning with warm lemon water/broth/coffee to go. Even with going daily I am still bloating/experiencing gas and feeling discomfort. This is especially after dinner.
- Brain fog. 24/7. Used to be on ADHD meds and sleep meds but went off last year. Now I only take a 15mg medical mary j gummy 1.5 hours before bed.
- Chronic insomnia ^. Since age 8 got put on melatonin. Then moved to harder pharmaceuticals and had been on anxiety, depression, adhd, insomnia meds until last year. Can’t fall asleep without taking something. Wake up constantly and can’t fall back asleep especially in the 2-4am range. 
- OCD/Anxiety/Depression. Pretty self explanatory. OCD is pretty f cking bad. Constant cyclical destructive depressive thoughts.

I worked with a functional doctor/nutritionist until a month ago when my insurance changed so now I am lost. I do castor oil packs nighty before bed, drink RO water w minerals added back in, eat 90/10 whole foods diet, I do drink alcohol 1x/week or every other week, taking GI Defense and binder + multivitamin + omega + mag citrate + mag glycinate + l theanine, have some form of organic tea daily, using organic mold free coffee and drink it after breakfast, working out 3-4x/week with weights, sauna 2-4x/week, walking after meals, etc. So yeah I feel like I am doing most things right and still feel constant bloating/gas, brain fog, insomnia, ocd, depression, anxiety, etc. Everyday feels like a battle and I just want my life back.

1g89arp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnigmaOfMaishulLothli/comments/1g89arp/nil_2/,Nil: 2,"I kept tabs on her—not in any significant way, but just every once in a while, checking on her to see if she needed help or if she was doing well. She had an extremely terse way of texting. I remembered how she'd never been one to reach out, but she also wouldn't refuse someone who reached out to her. And in the end, she was still just the same.

It was difficult. It was so, so difficult because she was just so passive. She didn't share much about her life. At first, I thought it was because she was a private person, but she revealed anything I asked about.

I eventually understood why: to her, nothing in her life was worth mentioning. She was a genius, a prodigy, a mage of incredible talent. But in her mind, she was just... her. Nothing was special about her life. It was simply the way it was.

I had to ask about her job, about her parents, about her hobbies, about her magic. I had to ask because she wouldn't offer it. She didn't consider it a burden and would give honest answers. She just didn't realize I'd want to know.

In a way, she really did just want to sit there, watching the ceiling, waiting for something to happen. Idle, almost rotting away.

I'd invited her out again, this time for coffee. It was never hard to convince her. She just accepted, as she always did.

I wanted to know. I still hadn't asked her about what had happened that night. But it had been months. I thought I'd gotten to know her enough.

""Hey, can I ask you something?"" I started, and she tilted her head slightly.

""What happened, at the convention?"" I didn't say more, but she understood what I meant.

""Oh, that."" She sighed softly, and her face seemed to tighten. ""I fell.""

""You fell."" I repeated back. I didn't understand how that could have happened. She'd been torn apart; her arm had been removed. She was covered in cuts and bruises. How could a mage of her caliber have been injured so severely by a simple fall, even if it was off a building or some other great height?

""I hit a spike on the way down."" Her voice was cold and blunt. She didn't want to talk about this.

""But you could have set up mage armor or featherfall."" It made no sense. She could have done that in an instant, without a focus. It was the first thing they taught you at the academy, for god's sake. How could she have fallen?

""I didn't."" The words were hard. Unyielding.

And that was when I started to realize.

""...Did you know you would survive?"" I asked. ""Did you know you could heal yourself?""

""Probably."" It was an admission, an acknowledgment. I stared at this girl, this young, beautiful, brilliant girl. I looked at the emptiness of her gaze. The lack of purpose. I felt the fear, that fear of her disappearing. The thought that if she had landed on her head, she wouldn't have come back.

""You didn't care,"" I realized.

""I didn't."" Her voice was a knife in my heart. No inflection, no feeling. Just a statement of fact. The sky was blue. The sun would rise in the morning. That day, she did not care if she would have survived the fall.

What could I possibly say to that? How could I possibly respond? This genius mage, this incredible young prodigy, cared so little about her own life that she'd been perfectly willing to die. She hadn't cared whether she survived or not.

It wasn't as if she was suicidal. It wasn't that she wanted to die. It was that, at that moment, she had not wanted to live. Ennui clung to her like a shroud, its reach so extensive that it covered even her own life. The sense that she would simply let the world do as it would, that she would not fight against it, that she would not try to change it. The sense that she had never really wanted anything.

""Have you ever wanted to live?"" I whispered. I was afraid. Afraid that I'd been too late. That the girl in front of me was nothing but an empty shell, waiting for the wind to carry her away.

She tilted her head, staring at me curiously. She looked as if I'd asked something absurd. Something nonsensical. Her stare felt so distant, so disconnected from the world, as if she wasn't even here.

""You've heard of inertia, yes?"" she finally asked, and I nodded. ""That is how I think of life. Life is motion, and it would be difficult to stop that motion.""

Her voice was detached, as if she were discussing the weather. I stared at her, and she smiled, an empty smile without any feeling behind it.

""But does the object care whether it is in motion or not? It resists change, but does that mean it wishes to keep moving? It would be easiest to let the momentum continue, I suppose."" She sounded so... uncaring. Like it didn't matter. ""If a force were to arise that would stop my momentum, I would not resist it.""

That was how she viewed life. It would be inconvenient for it to put in effort. She'd just follow the path wherever it took her. If it killed her, then it did. If it didn't, then it didn't. There was no desire, no want, nothing. Just the path she was on. She had no interest in changing it, in trying to change it.

""Then why do anything?"" It was a morbid thought. If there was nothing she wanted, if there was nothing she cared for, then what was the point? She had no reason to do anything if that were the case. There was no reason to respond to my texts, to come out to get coffee, to talk with me. To even eat or drink.

""I dislike pain. Hunger is pain. Ergo, I must eat to avoid pain,"" she said with a shrug of her shoulders. ""That is why you eat, no? To avoid the sensation of hunger?""

""No."" My voice was flat. ""I eat because it tastes good. I enjoy it.""

""Enjoy."" She said the word, and my heart broke. It wasn't that she said it with disgust or disdain. It wasn't that she was mocking the idea of enjoyment, of happiness. It was like an academic talking about some kind of force that they'd analyzed but never personally interacted with. Something she'd observed but never felt.

I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to reach her. She didn't want anything, so how could I convince her to want to live?

""Do you have any hopes? Anything you want?"" I asked desperately, trying to find something, anything. Something I could cling to that could be the foundation of a desire.

""I do.""

The admission was slow, as if she were admitting some dark secret rather than sharing a simple piece of information.

""What is it?"" I asked, hope rising within me.

""I want to be normal."" Her eyes bored into me, unblinking. ""I want to know what it is like to be able to eat something and feel something other than the cessation of hunger. I want to know what it is to be excited to do something, to want to do something. I want to have a goal, to have something I want to achieve. But how am I supposed to do any of that? How am I supposed to force a feeling?""

Her words were desperate, but her tone barely changed. I could feel a hint of longing, a barest whisper of sadness. But it was lost. Lost in that overwhelming ennui, the emptiness that seemed to fill her soul.

""You, and many others, regard me as some sort of genius. And perhaps I am. It is true that I have great magical aptitude. But what worth is that?"" she asked. ""It is not as if I do anything with my magic. It is simply a tool to reduce pain and inconvenience.""

Her words were not angry, hateful, bitter, or vindictive. To her, they were just simple truths, the way the world was. She might have been speaking of the color of her hair or her height—simple facts.

""I am good at other things, as well. I can draw, I can play instruments, I can sing."" She shook her head slightly. ""But I went to learn magic, because it is what my parents expected. Because it is what they wished, and it would cause difficulties if I refused. I did not want to learn magic, in the same way I do not want to eat food or want to breathe air. I simply did so because it was easier that way.""

I didn't know how to react to this. I didn't know how to respond to such a blunt, such a simple declaration. She'd never wanted to be a mage. She'd gone along with it because her parents had wanted her to. And it wasn't as if there was some burning passion she'd had to forego because of that, some dream she'd had that had been snuffed out.

The only thing she wanted was, paradoxically, to want. To have a dream, to have a desire, to have some goal she wished to achieve.

""I'm sorry,"" she apologized, her head tilting to the side. ""You're probably going to disappear, now that I have revealed all this.""

It hurt. It hurt to hear her say that, so matter of factly, as if it were some simple truth. The sun rose in the east. Birds migrated south in the winter. And now that she'd revealed this, I'd stop talking to her. That was the way of things.

""How could I?"" The question was rhetorical, but the answer was clear. I could. I could leave. I could ignore her. It wouldn't even be difficult, and others before me had obviously done the same. But why would I? ""How could I just... abandon you? Leave you like that?""

""People fear the abnormal, and I am abnormal."" She tapped her head with her fingers. ""I know that. I am not a fool without the ability to read other people. I know how to act normal, and so I do. I have always done my best to act like everyone else to avoid the pain of social rejection. But I am not.""

Her head tilted again, and she looked up, staring at the sky. She didn't seem to be seeing anything in particular. There were no clouds, no birds. Nothing that would draw her eye.

""I do not feel many things."" The words were a confession. A whisper of a secret. A thing she'd always known. ""But I do feel pain. And it hurts to know you will not see me again. But that is the way it is. I am abnormal, so you will reject me.""

She stood, her chair sliding back. She was done with her coffee. She looked down at me, and I saw that same empty smile. The smile of someone who was simply doing what they were supposed to.

""I am sorry I could not maintain the illusion any better. I am tainted by abnormality. But I did my best. I did not lie about anything. It is just the way I am. And I do not know how to not be the way I am. I have never been able to figure it out."" She bowed slightly, in apology or in farewell, and turned away. She began to leave. Her body was relaxed. Calm. She wasn't tense. She wasn't angry. She was simply walking away.

""I...I'm not going to leave."" I stood as well, walking after her. ""I promise. I'm not just going to abandon you.""

She turned, her expression still that faint smile. ""Why not?""

The question was blunt, but it was honest. ""I understand that I must be emotionally exhausting. You need not deal with that. We were not friends to begin with, anyway. Just acquaintances.""

""I'm not going to leave,"" I repeated, my voice firm. My heart was racing, my head was spinning, and I was terrified, but I would not leave her to rot. She was still a person. She still had a dream. A dream she had long given up on, but it was there. She wanted to want.

""That is a stupid decision."" Her voice was calm, but her head was tilted again in that display of curiosity. ""I cannot offer anything to you. I cannot offer emotional support. I cannot offer friendship. I am not a friend.""

""Then why did you agree to come here?"" I demanded, my fists clenching. How could she be like this? Why would she be like this?

""Because it would have been more effort to say no,"" she replied, and it was a knife to my heart. ""Because that is how the world expects me to act. Because that is what you expect me of me.""

I took one step, then another. She watched me, that same curious gaze.

I wrapped my arms around her. I squeezed as hard as I could. She was stiff. Unyielding. But she was still warm, still breathing. Even with that horrible emptiness, that terrible sense of purposelessness, she was still alive.

""Then, please,"" I begged. I was desperate and afraid, but I would try. ""Please, let me be your friend.""

Her hand slowly, awkwardly, came to rest on my back.

""I will not refuse,"" she whispered, her voice a breeze in my ear. It was a small thing, a tiny thing, but it was enough. I would not let her rot. I would be her friend, and I would try.

So if we have all been laughing at her (i'm British) i'm sure other peoples, leaders have also laughed along with us. 

Lets face facts, she got the VP job for 2 reasons, she's black and she is a woman, if she was white and a man she wouldn't have got within a bajillion miles of the most powerful job on the planet and how does she go from a Global laughing stock to being respected and seen as a leader who will do everything to end war (Trump Policy) ban tax on tips (Trump policy), get tougher on the wall and border security (Trump policy) and be anything other than a toothless World leader who can be manipulated as everyone knows Obama will be pulling the strings.

I'm not and never have been racist or a misogenious man, my own children and of mixed heritage but the ONLY reason she got VP was because shes black-ish (lol) and a woman, thats her credentials for the Oval Office.

I’m looking for a woman who would be interested in talking with me each day, getting to know one another, and eventually becoming long term partners if we are compatible. 

I will write here with optimism hoping for something good to happen. I believe these sorts of personal ads are good for gauging compatibility.

As of late I have felt a lot of desire for the company of a woman. I hope this post finds you well.

I’m an immensely cerebral person, I love to write creatively, to listen to music, to consume art, to muse about things on the fringes of human understanding, to ask questions and fuel curiosity, to explore new ideas and perspectives. I’m open minded and empathic.

I love aesthetics, looking at fall colors, beautiful grey clouds and autumnal leaves, beauty is what I love. On that note, this season, the cold air, sleepy coffee. I’m made for October.

I’m a very patient and soft hearted person, I love to be of assistance wherever I can be. I hate seeing others suffering.

I like women who are very bold, assertive, confident, and perverted.

Attraction is important to me so let us please exchange photos.

I am in college studying engineering and near my school I frequent a coffee shop. I am a regular there. I met some cool people there and it’s a nice place to grab a coffee and read. I saw a girl that comes there as well I could say she is also a regular, I see her almost weekly. I am an avid reader and pretty much always reading classic novels drinking a macchiato(a routine that relaxes me). First time I saw her she was reading Jane Austen and she sat next to me, I remember thinking she’s gorgeous and actually reads a classic like me. Ever since then I notice her in the crowd, I am sure there are many regulars there and I don’t know them but her, I NOTICE HER PRESENCE. And I KNOW she notices me too because almost all the time we make eye contact and crack a smile. Sometimes i would be leaving the coffee shop and she would be walking toward it, we would pass each other on the road and I can’t control my smile and she smiles from far away till we pass each other. 
A little background on me, I am relatively new to the country been here since I was 18(no family members at all and only had $45 when I arrived) so It was a struggle to stabilize my living situation and go to school while working and learning new culture. But I am doing well now well acclimated so that’s why I am a little late to college 2nd year undergraduate at 27. It was really difficult to get here and so I HAVE NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND. I’ve had sexual encounters with several women but NEVER a relationship. So I have a certain level of anxiety about it. I am always self conscious about my finances my career and where I should be at 27 etcetera so I never thought about dating someone till I am done developing myself in to the man I want to become.
But, I can’t get her out of my mind. Now whenever I go to the coffee shop I am thinking “I wonder if I see her today” . Recently I was drinking coffee and reading on the patio and she came and sat next to me and she had her mom with her(I know it’s her mom because she called her “mom”). The entire time her mom and her barely said a word to each other. When I stood up to leave both of them were looking at me smiling 🙂. I said “hello” and smiled and left. At this point am feeling STUPID, because I’ve missed soooo many chances to strike up a conversation. I am almost done I promise lol. Now two weeks ago I was leaving the coffee shop she was coming in and I see a guy with her. She looks me dead in the eyes 👀 I didn’t even look at the guy I just smiled and kept walking. The 3 days later I see her there and the guy is sitting with her, and he’s not facing me but she was and we looked at each other a couple of times. When she went to order a coffee she placed an order and turned around and she would look at me. We saw each other today she was by herself didn’t have her book bag or nothing just dressed beautifully and she got her coffee and left. 
I feel like I a dumbass. I feel like a useless idiot. Now I know I am supposed to talk to her I know that. But I don’t know how to go about it. What if I speak to her and all this is just in my head what if she doesn’t even know I exist, like she just looked at me like a random guy. And now she might have a man. Wouldn’t it be weird? How can I go about it. Please help me. I WANT HER.  DID I BLOW IT? 😔😔😔😔😔",1,1729458096.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1g88xba,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1g88xba/80_days_sober_heavy_thinking/,80 days sober. Heavy thinking. ,"80 sober days. Lots of thinking. Maybe looking for advice. Could help someone by reading. 

I am 80 days sober.
 There are several things I want to share. 

      First on my mind right now is. It has been weighing on me more and more. How am I ever going to rebuild and recover from the past actions. I have made such a fool of myself. Never seems possible to have people treat me as anything more than a screw-up looser. Doesn't seem possible to recover from how people see me. 
     Where does my life go from here? I very much want to move far away and start fresh. New job, make new friends ( don't really have any here anyway ). 
      Some people are drinkers because of the social groups they have. Not me. It was just something I did to shut down. I think I drank not to have to be with myself. ( Not sure i much like time with me ) can't say i blame others.
       But where does my life go now? I am looking at the future, and it's a big scary void, a black hole of emptiness. Lots of boredom, or lots of occupying my time with pointless activities. I look at buying crap other people get excited about, but I know myself enough to understand it's not going to matter much in a few weeks.  I've been looking at a motorcycle and making it a kind of hobby. However, I know ultimately it will just be me, spending more time with myself. Same with video gaming. I'm just wasting time. It's kind of still the same as getting drunk. 

 Second. The last 7 to 10 days, I am finally feeling like I have more energy. People will tell you how great they feel not drinking, but 2½ months in., I wasn't feeling much improved from a day after drinking. I never had much for headaches, but I do now. Thankfully, it's getting to be less and less in the last week.
     I also have a little more drive to keep my house tightly. Wash dishes and vacuum. I'm still not good at getting motivated cooking meals and feeding myself. I am reminded of something I heard once about, self improvement being hard because it's boring. In the same way, it's boring to brush your teeth or comb your hair. Their is no adventure in it. No struggle, no excitement, and no way to fuck it up so bad you might die. 
     My acne seems to be subsiding a little bit. Hard to tell because of my work environments being so dirty. Also my digestion is definitely improving in the last 10 days to 2 weeks. So if you are struggling with that you might have a bit of an idea. 
 
      Third.  It's much less of a thought when I am in the grocery store to even think about buying alcohol. I had such a habit it was just something I bought, like eggs, milk, and coffee. At first, it was a place i looked at when in the store. I am not going to claim i don't think about it at all ever. It's just hardly something I am drawn to or give much thought. Where I live it used to require a separate stop at a dedicated liquor store. But now it's in every store right alongside the orange juice. So it had more pull when I shop. 

    So, just some thoughts and an update.  Bit of ranting,

1g88wgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g88wgt/is_it_normal_to_feel_this_way_or_am_i_just/,Is it normal to feel this way or am I just torturing myself?,"So i moved back home in March, started talking to this girl and just to put it out there, she told me she did not have feelings after hanging out for about a month. Nonetheless we continued to hangout but it got progressively more lovey dovey as time went on, i.e cuddling, kissing, sleeping at her place, sex.

She told me every day that she did not want to date me but continued to ask what i was doing and if i wanted to hangout. We start hanging out basically every day at some point, whether it was at either houses or just getting a coffee in the morning. About 3 months go by of that, and she finally said what the hell and we went out to dinner and i made her my girlfriend. The relationship stressed her out, she was drinking more and just seemed extremely anxious all the time. She put it on me like it was my fault because she felt so pressured to make me happy. Which i was so into her so i didn’t see why she felt that way.

We fought all the time, mostly on her part because anything and everything pissed her off. She is one gorgeous woman so i feel like i was blinded by all the red flags because of that. But i got so comfortable with this woman and i opened up, as did she, and now here we are separated for over a month already.

We’ve been texting even though she knows how bad she hurt me. I’ve told her that I’m hurt and i want her back but she just wanted to be friends. I tried so hard to be, but i couldn’t take it. I texted her so many times telling her how i felt which i know was wrong and i was acting in the moment of how i felt. About a week after the breakup, we went to go for a drive and talk and she made it clear that she is already back on Hinge.

I called her yesterday, telling her i miss her and everything and she got sick of it. She blocked me on all social media platforms, including my number. She included ghat she does not hate me, but it became to be too much for her. She included and i quote “i told you i needed space and you wouldn’t give that to me. If you contact me again or message me from someone elses phone, we’re gonna have a big issue because thats harassment.” 

Though the relationship was shaky, we did so much together in a short time. Cider mill in our home town, trip to NYC, she even broke her foot and i was with her at the hospital the whole time. After that i took care of her all the time.

Today is day 1 with no contact at all and i know she went out with her friends last night to bars. The amount of pain i’m feeling is unlike any other. Shortly before the breakup, we were driving and she accidentally slipped up and said “i love you” i looked at her and my eyes widened l. She knew i had caught her saying that and it was the greatest feeling ever. So how can she just get up and leave?

I’m just waiting for her to unblock me and text me but at this point, i don’t think that’ll ever happen again. I try going to the gym, hanging with family and friends, but nothing is helping. I just want her back. 

I have lost myself. I don’t enjoy the things i once did. My parents don’t understand because dating is so different now. I feel like ive been used for my kindness. I never want to love again. I am so tired. I haven’t had more than 4 hours of sleep in weeks. Eating dinner with my parents is even harder. I don’t want to anything with anyone. I need someone to talk to.

Anything helps! ,"Hi all! I am at a loss at this point. In October 2023 I went off of HBC after having an IUD since October 2017. I have not gotten a period since October 2017. Hormone testing reveals low progesterone, low estrodial, mid testosterone, high dhea. Bloodwork suggests liver/kidney function normal while thyroid function could use some work but nothing crazy low. GI Map back in November 2023 showed not enough healthy bacteria and overgrowth of bad bacteria but nothing again off the charts. Never directly did a breath test for SIBO so that will be my next test. 
Currently experiencing:
- Bloating. Used to be constant after ever meal. Was going days without a BM. Focused on gut health and eliminating UPFs. Eating every 4 hours ~2000 calories. Balancing fiber, fats, protein, carbs.  Now I go daily, but don’t always feel complete. Have to start every morning with warm lemon water/broth/coffee to go. Even with going daily I am still bloating/experiencing gas and feeling discomfort. This is especially after dinner.
- Brain fog. 24/7. Used to be on ADHD meds and sleep meds but went off last year. Now I only take a 15mg medical mary j gummy 1.5 hours before bed.
- Chronic insomnia ^. Since age 8 got put on melatonin. Then moved to harder pharmaceuticals and had been on anxiety, depression, adhd, insomnia meds until last year. Can’t fall asleep without taking something. Wake up constantly and can’t fall back asleep especially in the 2-4am range. 
- OCD/Anxiety/Depression. Pretty self explanatory. OCD is pretty f cking bad. Constant cyclical destructive depressive thoughts.

I worked with a functional doctor/nutritionist until a month ago when my insurance changed so now I am lost. I do castor oil packs nighty before bed, drink RO water w minerals added back in, eat 90/10 whole foods diet, I do drink alcohol 1x/week or every other week, taking GI Defense and binder + multivitamin + omega + mag citrate + mag glycinate + l theanine, have some form of organic tea daily, using organic mold free coffee and drink it after breakfast, working out 3-4x/week with weights, sauna 2-4x/week, walking after meals, etc. So yeah I feel like I am doing most things right and still feel constant bloating/gas, brain fog, insomnia, ocd, depression, anxiety, etc. Everyday feels like a battle and I just want my life back.

Initially it was a temporary break, but just over a week ago I made the end final. They decided to go no contact with me a few days after. 

I respected their no contact until they broke it first. We still live in the same apartment. It's not ideal but it's temporary. They were away visiting family and were due back today. When I got back from meeting some friends for coffee they were home. 

They started blowing up my phone with texts begging me to stay with them and try again. I asked them to stop several times and they wouldn't. They said that we could work through things together and that I'm making the wrong choice. I said I'm making the right choice for me and they said I shouldn't trust that judgement. This was a big red flag because part of the abuse was gaslughting me into trusting their judgement and emotions over mine. 

This went back and forth for a while, until I told them they were being unintentionally manipulative by dropping all of this on me. I explained that they could have asked me if I was in a place to hear their feelings but they just dropped them all on me. I said it was selfish. They disagreed and got really upset I said it was unintentionally manipulative. Then they started saying things like ""you treated me bad too but I stayed, that's the difference between us"", and ""oh so I shouldn't share my feelings? I won't apologise for being soft and expressive"". The whole thing fucked with my head. 

I found out from a mutual friend that they left the apartment without me knowing, and are not in hospital in the emergency department staying the night. I feel like they should have told me? I only found out because I asked a friend if they knew where my ex was. I don't know what to do. Obviously my body is screaming at me to go and comfort them because I love them so much. But I know that would be bad for both of us. 

Is this manipulative? Is this genuine? I don't know what to think. ",3,1729457754.0,domesticviolence,2,1.0,False

I've recently moved to Canada (Guelph), after living in the land down under for 6ish years. I primarily work as an audio engineer but also do a bunch of stuff as an audio-visual tech. I do work alot when the times are busy, but it's starting to slow down a bit with the winter approaching and I'd like to make friends with whom I could possibly hang out too.

I enjoy exploring cafes (love a good coffee), dive bars, art galleries and live music. I have a thing for waterfalls and going out to explore the country. 

Low-budget films (with incredible storylines), psycho thriller, biographies capture my attention. I don't read as much as I used to but trying to get back into it. I play soccer a few times a month and have been contemplating climbing. Also, this would be my first white winter and I'm keen beans to try snowboarding.

1g88r5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/throneandliberty/comments/1g88r5r/throne_and_liberty_a_game_review_thats_half/,"Throne and Liberty: A Game Review That's Half Laughter, Half Therapy","Welcome to Throne and Liberty, a game that’s as visually stunning as your ex’s Instagram feed but with enough clunky mechanics to remind you why you should stick to browsing cat videos. Let’s dive into the pixelated world of thrill and frustration—because what’s gaming without a sprinkle of chaos, right?  
  
The Good Stuff (Pros)  
Visuals That Wow: If you’ve ever wanted to feel like you’re frolicking through a digital wonderland, Throne and Liberty delivers. The graphics are breathtaking—think of it as the game equivalent of a fancy artisanal latte. Every environment is beautifully crafted, making you forget that you just spent an hour stuck in a bush trying to find the exit.  
  
Character Customization: Ever wanted to create a character that looks like a warrior but fights like a toddler with a plastic sword? You can! The customization options are so extensive that you might spend more time tweaking your character's jawline than actually playing the game.  
  
Large-Scale PvP: There’s nothing quite like the thrill of watching 500 players try to crush each other like overripe grapes in a giant wine press. The chaos is exhilarating, albeit slightly terrifying. Just don’t expect to be the hero in this cinematic masterpiece—unless you have a death wish.  
  
Progressive Low to Midgame: The early game is like that satisfying first sip of coffee in the morning—great rewards, a sense of growth, and a hope that maybe today you won’t screw it all up. It feels like you’re moving forward, and that’s a refreshing change from staring at your screen wondering why you still don’t have pants.  
  
Fair Upgrading System: Unlike that friend who always takes the last slice of pizza, the weapon, armor, and skill upgrading system is fair and balanced. You actually feel like your efforts matter, which is a delightful surprise in a game that often feels like a hamster wheel.  
  
The Not-So-Good Stuff (Cons)  
Endgame PvE: Time-Gated and Repetitive: Once you hit the endgame, you might feel like you’re trapped in a never-ending episode of a reality show where the only plot twist is more waiting. Time-gated content can feel more tedious than watching paint dry—on a rainy day.  
  
Solo PvP Woes: If you thought playing solo was empowering, think again. Small-scale PvP can feel like bringing a spoon to a knife fight—good luck with that. You might just end up as a statistic in someone else’s highlight reel.  
  
GvG Meaninglessness: Joining a small to mid-sized guild in large-scale GvG is like being the tiny boat in a sea of battleships. You’ll feel more like cannon fodder than a brave warrior. Don’t forget your life jacket!  
  
Top Guilds: The Economy Monopolizers: If you thought capitalism was rough in real life, wait until you see top guilds running the economy like it’s Monopoly night. Getting a seat at the table feels more like a job application—complete with a resume and a cover letter explaining why you’re not a total noob.  
  
Guilds = Job Tasks: Being part of most guilds is less about camaraderie and more about completing daily tasks. Forget about fun; it’s all about checking boxes, meeting quotas, and wishing you had just stayed home.  
  
Daily Activity Requirements: You better be prepared to clock in every day, or you’ll find yourself on the irrelevant bench faster than you can say “pay-to-win.”  
  
RNG is King: In Throne and Liberty, luck is less about fortune and more about how many times you can roll the dice before they start laughing at you. If your luck is worse than a black cat on Friday the 13th, prepare for a long, poor road.  
  
Weapon Class Rerolls: Need a different weapon class? Good luck with that. You might be better off creating an alt character. It’s like playing the lottery, only to realize you just bought a ticket for the wrong game. Theres no way of previewing how a class will play like. So its either hit or miss.  
  
Clunky Movement and Combat: Navigating this game can feel like trying to dance in a phone booth—awkward and utterly frustrating. Especially if you’re a melee class. Seriously, who thought combat on elevated terrain was a good idea when it has not been optimized yet?  
  
Dungeon Mechanics: A Mystery: Ever joined a dungeon and felt like you were the only one who didn’t read the instructions? Good luck with that! The game’s mechanics can be none to so vague that you might as well be trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded and get roasted or expelled from the party if you fail.  
  
External Resources Required: You’ll find yourself searching for guides on YouTube like a lost child in a grocery store. If you don’t, you might just get flamed, roasted or expelled from the party for not knowing or researching anything externally.  
  
Free-to-Play Struggles: If you’re a free-to-play player, expect to feel like a hamster on a wheel, chasing that elusive power. By the time you catch up, the goalposts will have moved, and you’ll be back where you started.  
  
Chasing Power for Whales: While you’re grinding to keep up, it often feels like you’re just fodder for the whales, whose swiping behavior encourages this endless chase for power. It’s like being the sidekick in someone else’s superhero movie—where the hero is too busy swiping to notice you.  
  
In conclusion, Throne and Liberty is a wild ride filled with beauty and frustration, camaraderie and competition. Whether you’re battling it out in PvP or desperately trying to figure out the mechanics of a dungeon, you’ll likely experience a range of emotions—mostly wondering why you signed up for this.

We chat via teams all the time, we don't really have any reason to talk about work so it's not about work stuff, as we work in two unrelated departments. Occasionally I stop by and we talk and chat for what feels like as long as we can both get away with it. We both talk about our personal lives, our hopes, ambitions, weekend plans. Very much business hours only type friendship so far. 

She mentioned that she misses seeing me, after I got stuck unable to stop over at her building for a while. I took that as a sign and asked her to go get coffee, but she said no, she just picked up a drink that morning. I gave it a week and asked again, but she was too busy that day. I left it open ended, to let me know if she wants to grab a cup sometime. Its been a couple weeks, we are still talking regularly, I stopped by her desk and had a great chat this week. I want to ask her again, but I'm worried that I'm coming across too strong if the last 2 times were because she's not interested, and she has just been polite. I don't want to be the guy from the second panel of the HR comic.

And to be honest, if we stay friends, that would be great too. But I want to be the type of friends that can run and grab a decent cup of coffee together. How do I let her know I'm into her, but that I'm ok if it's just friendship, but we gotta take it to the next level, even if the next level is just the local Starbucks.

1g88pm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1g88pm8/80_days_sober_some_heavy_thinking_maybe_looking/,80 days sober. Some heavy thinking. Maybe looking for advice. ,"

I am 80 days sober.
 There are several things I want to share. 

      First on my mind right now is. It has been weighing on me more and more. How am I ever going to rebuild and recover from the past actions. I have made such a fool of myself. Never seems possible to have people treat me as anything more than a screw-up looser. Doesn't seem possible to recover from how people see me. 
     Where does my life go from here? I very much want to move far away and start fresh. New job, make new friends ( don't really have any here anyway ). 
      Some people are drinkers because of the social groups they have. Not me. It was just something I did to shut down. I think I drank not to have to be with myself. ( Not sure i much like time with me ) can't say i blame others.
       But where does my life go now? I am looking at the future, and it's a big scary void, a black hole of emptiness. Lots of boredom, or lots of occupying my time with pointless activities. I look at buying crap other people get excited about, but I know myself enough to understand it's not going to matter much in a few weeks.  I've been looking at a motorcycle and making it a kind of hobby. However, I know ultimately it will just be me, spending more time with myself. Same with video gaming. I'm just wasting time. It's kind of still the same as getting drunk. 
      
    Second. The last 7 to 10 days, I am finally feeling like I have more energy. People will tell you how great they feel not drinking, but 2½ months in., I wasn't feeling much improved from a day after drinking. I never had much for headaches, but I do now. Thankfully, it's getting to be less and less in the last week.
     I also have a little more drive to keep my house tightly. Wash dishes and vacuum. I'm still not good at getting motivated cooking meals and feeding myself. I am reminded of something I heard once about, self improvement being hard because it's boring. In the same way, it's boring to brush your teeth or comb your hair. Their is no adventure in it. No struggle, no excitement, and no way to fuck it up so bad you might die. 
     My acne seems to be subsiding a little bit. Hard to tell because of my work environments being so dirty. Also my digestion is definitely improving in the last 10 days to 2 weeks. So if you are struggling with that you might have a bit of an idea. 
     
     Third. It's much less of a thought when I am in the grocery store to even think about buying alcohol. I had such a habit it was just something I bought, like eggs, milk, and coffee. At first, it was a place i looked at when in the store. I am not going to claim i don't think about it at all ever. It's just hardly something I am drawn to or give much thought. Where I live it used to require a separate stop at a dedicated liquor store. But now it's in every store right alongside the orange juice. So it had more pull when I shop. 

    So, just some thoughts and an update.  Bit of ranting,

I've recently moved to Canada (Guelph), after living in the land down under for 6ish years. I primarily work as an audio engineer but also do a bunch of stuff as an audio-visual tech. I do work alot when the times are busy, but it's starting to slow down a bit with the winter approaching and I'd like to make friends with whom I could possibly hang out too.

I enjoy exploring cafes (love a good coffee), dive bars, art galleries and live music. I have a thing for waterfalls and going out to explore the country. 

Low-budget films (with incredible storylines), psycho thriller, biographies capture my attention. I don't read as much as I used to but trying to get back into it. I play soccer a few times a month and have been contemplating climbing. Also, this would be my first white winter and I'm keen beans to try snowboarding. 

If this sounds like your jam or an invitation to be a friend, say hi.

1g88lfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g88lfl/coffee_shop_crush_please_help/,Coffee shop crush! Please HELP 😔😔😔,"Hello, I am 27(m). I am in college studying engineering and near my school I frequent a coffee shop. I am a regular there. I met some cool people there and it’s a nice place to grab a coffee and read. I saw a girl that comes there as well I could say she is also a regular, I see her almost weekly. I am an avid reader and pretty much always reading classic novels drinking a macchiato(a routine that relaxes me). First time I saw her she was reading Jane Austen and she sat next to me, I remember thinking she’s gorgeous and actually reads a classic like me. Ever since then I notice her in the crowd, I am sure there are many regulars there and I don’t know them but her, I NOTICE HER PRESENCE. And I KNOW she notices me too because almost all the time we make eye contact and crack a smile. Sometimes i would be leaving the coffee shop and she would be walking toward it, we would pass each other on the road and I can’t control my smile and she smiles from far away till we pass each other. 
A little background on me, I am relatively new to the country been here since I was 18(no family members at all and only had $45 when I arrived) so It was a struggle to stabilize my living situation and go to school while working and learning new culture. But I am doing well now well acclimated so that’s why I am a little late to college 2nd year undergraduate at 27. It was really difficult to get here and so I HAVE NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND. I’ve had sexual encounters with several women but NEVER a relationship. So I have a certain level of anxiety about it. I am always self conscious about my finances my career and where I should be at 27 etcetera so I never thought about dating someone till I am done developing myself in to the man I want to become.
But, I can’t get her out of my mind. Now whenever I go to the coffee shop I am thinking “I wonder if I see her today” . Recently I was drinking coffee and reading on the patio and she came and sat next to me and she had her mom with her(I know it’s her mom because she called her “mom”). The entire time her mom and her barely said a word to each other. When I stood up to leave both of them were looking at me smiling 🙂. I said “hello” and smiled and left. At this point am feeling STUPID, because I’ve missed soooo many chances to strike up a conversation. I am almost done I promise lol. Now two weeks ago I was leaving the coffee shop she was coming in and I see a guy with her. She looks me dead in the eyes 👀 I didn’t even look at the guy I just smiled and kept walking. The 3 days later I see her there and the guy is sitting with her, and he’s not facing me but she was and we looked at each other a couple of times. When she went to order a coffee she placed an order and turned around and she would look at me. We saw each other today she was by herself didn’t have her book bag or nothing just dressed beautifully and she got her coffee and left. 
I feel like I a dumbass. I feel like a useless idiot. Now I know I am supposed to talk to her I know that. But I don’t know how to go about it. What if I speak to her and all this is just in my head what if she doesn’t even know I exist, like she just looked at me like a random guy. And now she might have a man. Wouldn’t it be weird? How can I go about it. Please help me. I WANT HER.  DID I BLOW IT? 😔😔😔😔😔",1,1729457085.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1g88l96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1g88l96/my_partner_never_wakes_with_the_kids_and_im/,My partner never wakes with the kids and I’m resenting him for being selfish ,"I’ll start by saying that whilst I don’t love getting up early with the kids, I can be a “morning person” and am ok after 15 mins (and sometimes a coffee). I’m also a fairly light sleeper which really helps to get up for the kids, but it means I struggle to get back to sleep once awake.

My partner, on the other hand, is a deep sleeper and NOT a morning person. I took myself to bed last night at maybe 10 as the baby woke so I put him back to sleep, and my partner said “oh it’s only 10, it’s still early!” He used to stay up until 2/3, but now it’s more like 11.30/12.30. He works from home for himself as a course creator and designer, so his hours don’t have to be 9-5 but he chooses to work those hours (or thereabouts, usually 8-5, the earliest has been 7-4.30). As he’s a deep sleeper, I do all night wakings. We cosleep with our toddler and baby and before anyone comes at me with “you need to stop cosleeping”, it works for me to get as much sleep as possible. 

We recently agreed that I would wake up with the baby and he would wake with the toddler, who tends to wake later. I now sleep in a room with the baby and the toddler and Dad share as they’re deeper sleepers and move around and wake me at night.

Unfortunately, my partner is struggling to wake up in the morning and although the baby usually wakes first, even when our toddler wakes first, Dad doesn’t. 

This morning, baby unceremoniously woke me at 5.45 (normally 6.30/7 which is fine), then toddler woke at 6.15 after baby surprisingly went back to sleep! Yet it’s me who’s been awake since 5.45, Dad just wandered out of bed at 7.25. I’d hoped to sneak back to bed when baby went to sleep but no chance as Dad did not get up with the toddler. He knew I was awake and just kept sleeping.

I’ve tried to be understanding and I’ve been angry and resentful. It’s hard but it’s not like I want to be up early either. Toddler doesn’t nap anymore so there are no breaks for me until both kids are asleep, which is usually 7 but sometimes 8.30/9 if toddler accidentally naps or baby naps late.

So I know I can’t do it for him, but how do people who struggle to wake get up? I hate starting the day angry at my partner. I get my shower in the morning kid free but that’s it as he runs off to work right after. I don’t think it’s fair and we keep fighting about it, but I don’t know what else to do to be less angry about it. ",22,1729457071.0,Parenting,27,0.96,False

This made me think I was having an early on set of dementia or alzhimers so it led me to research what could be the cause of it. I came across the term 'brainfog' which I've never heard before leading me to common causes such as stress down to the conspiracy theorist rabbit hole of  vaccines. 

I eventually found out that it was related to my gluten intolerance which I initially thought only gave me skin issues such as acne breakout and hives...now I've gotta add severe brain fog on that list.

Anyway my question is...if this is common? And if anyone has the same symptoms as I do; what other issues are you having that I can also look out for?

He asked me do you mind if I go hunting if we aren’t going to the festival I said no we already planned it as a family day I just didn’t want you to be stuck in traffic he kept pushing and asking over and over even though I said no. I finally said I don’t care you’re going to do whatever you want anyways. Which he does I’ll say no and he does whatever he wants to and just “deals” with me being upset it happens a lot I usually only say no if it’s last minute or he’s supposed to be watching our children while I have a doctors appointment or we have plans with his family. He’s always grumpy all the time always yelling at our children and throws fits and trys to manipulate me when he does get his way. He doesn’t try and have conversations ever he just gets defensive and picks at my insecurities. I told him that I’m tired of being put last all the time I asked him besides my birthday when have you gone out of your way to do something for me?

When he’s home on weekends he sits on the couch or plays games on his phone while I’m caring for kids making everyone good including him and myself picking up after him I hardly ever get thank yous I never get to relax. Or if we do something on his weekend as a family it ends in him telling because “the kids don’t listen” and everyone’s day is ruined or him completely ignoring the kiddos and leaving it all up to me…then we have had multiple conversations about me needing more help from him so I can get breaks too because I’m in over my head with stress and also want to relax I haven’t had a day without a kid in over a year! He goes hunting 3x a weekend every weekend…and I’m leafy with all the doctors appointments making dentist appointments my appointments (we have a special needs child) so I snapped…I told him I’m tired of feeling like he doesn’t care about me, show me love, and not respecting me as a person. I just feel like a servant and you are there for me when it’s convenient for you…which is not a lot and I’m tired of him always putting his kids last if it’s not what he wants to do… am I overreacting?

1g88ggn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/comments/1g88ggn/books_bones_and_buns_bookshops_and_bonedust_by/,"Books, Bones and Buns: Bookshops and Bonedust by Travis Baldree (a review) ","I just finished the novel B*ookshops & Bonedust* by Travis Baldree. It is the prequel to the equally well-received *Legends & Lattes*, and essentially the second book in this series about Viv’s adventures. I’ve got a few things to say about this book, so saddle up.

This story still follows the adventures of Viv, the thrill-seeking Orc warrior from L&L, but it takes place a few years before the events in that book. Injured in a battle with her team of mercenaries, Viv is left in the tiny seaside town of Murk to recover. In there she discovers a bookshop, and before long, she becomes integrated into the local society, helping out the bookstore owner with her failing business, getting into romantic entanglements, and also being thrown into a mysterious case involving a dangerous enemy….

In the acknowledgments section, Mr. Baldree makes a comment about how the second book is always the hardest to write. In this case, I believe the end result acclaims him greatly. I’d dare to say this book is better than *Legends & Lattes*.

Let us also address the elephant in the room: yes, this story has stakes. Quite a lot of them – but I believe not enough to make the more hardline-cozy readers feel uncomfortable. It follows a different line of storytelling than L&L, but it’s still at heart an extremely cozy tale: all these descriptions of Viv reading or helping fix the bookstore, her walks around Murk, give it an almost Studio Ghibli-esque vibe for me. The supporting characters are also interesting and funny, and the different little mysteries that Viv goes through along the way utterly entertaining.    

What I also really enjoyed was how Baldree incorporated >!excerpts of in-universe novels that Viv read into the story!<. It is not a unique technique, but it gave the story a sense of depth.

The ending, like in L&L could be seen as heartbreaking, and in all honesty, it also made my eyes water a little – >!but the little epilogue really made up for that!<, and I think it will satisfy lovers of the first book.

Just in a personal note now, I’d love to see Mr. Baldree continue this book series, and maybe tie these two first books together: Maybe Viv having to go on a journey away from Thune to find some very specific tea-blends for the coffee shop, and she ends up in a mysterious situation far away, all the while contacting Tandri through letters and sampling tea blends – could call it *Myths and Menageries* or something. Just an idea.

So, I cannot do anything more than just recommend this book and its accompanying sequel – they are cozy, warm and with the possibility of expansion into a multi-part series. So, grab a warm cup of chocolate, sit in your fluffiest armchair and begin reading!

So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 24/F, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Metaphor: ReFantazio the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even enjoy a CoD match or two each day. I'll be buying Black Ops 6 when it drops.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

Honorable mentions: Chili, sushi, Pepsi, coffee, weed, tequila, Holidays, my cat.

1g88ev7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/1g88ev7/what_to_do_when_overwhelm_affects_the_marriage/,What to do when overwhelm affects the marriage,"First post, trying to follow all the rules!   
  
Self: I am 42. Husband is 38. I am not very familiar with RPW but I am not sure where else to ask this. Truthfully I'm coming more from a complementarian Christian perspective but this board seems relevant.   
  
Relationship: My husband and I have been married 7 years, together 9. We share a home and a child. Our bedroom life is less active than we would like, although we believe we have a new babysitter so I hope that will change! (I seem to care more about the issue than he does, but it's hard to tell, he's def a strong-and-silent type.)

Problem: The problem is that I let my husband take on way too much of the childcare and I don't think it's fair to him and it's not consistent with the ways in which I would like to serve him. This issue has been going on almost forever (our child is 6), but I'm only recently acknowledging that it is a problem, rather than just... feeling a mixture of guilt and gratitude that I try to ignore because it's uncomfortable. 

My contribution: I think the basic problem is that my husband is just much better self-regulated than I am. So first of all, I get way too impatient with my son. This makes my husband step in when he senses I'm at my limit--but my limit is way too little! My husband is much much more patient with him, almost endlessly patient. Second of all... We both work full time, and it's probably true that my job is more high-stress than his is, but it's also certainly true that I am MUCH less good at handling stress. He just basically doesn't ever seem to feel overwhelmed, truly almost never, whereas it is common for me.  

He volunteers to take on so much childcare, or if I ask him he will do it too. But it just ends up feeling as though he's constantly serving me in this way whereas I would like to be serving him! Obviously there are other ways of serving and I do a bunch of other things--a lot of the cleaning (that said he does a big clean every week when I take our kid to a far away French class), a lot of the shopping and social organizing, I make his coffee each morning, I try to clean up after him (that said I'm sure he cleans up after me too), I do the large majority of the cooking, and I just try to do things like... If we're all sitting down and my son wants something, I try to be the one who jumps up and gets it. If we need something from upstairs, again, I try to be the one that gets it. But all of those things end up feeling ""little"" when he's doing so much of the childcare, I guess especially because I enjoy the childcare less, in most cases, than I enjoy the other domestic work. But a day like today, I really wanted to be the one to volunteer to take LO to a birthday party, but it filled me with anxiety because I needed the time to do so many other things--which I did (thus the Reddit break)--but did I really need all that time, or again was it just anxiety? 

I know that if I asked it he would say it was okay, but I kind of suspect he resents it, and in any event I certainly want him to have more time to himself on weekends! To do things he wants instead of things a child wants. I have certainly picked up on the fact that my husband gets irritated if he thinks that I am anxious irrationally. (Which is probably a lot of the time, because anxiety is mostly pretty irrational.) 

Thanks. I started writing this thinking the fundamental problem was my job, but now I'm thinking it's more about my lack of coping skills. ",1,1729456592.0,RedPillWives,0,1.0,False

1g88ebq,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1g88ebq/deception_6_its_all_just_physics/,Deception #6 – It’s All Just Physics,"The SEP authors continue with the Stoics and Epicureans. These two introduce the concept of *natural* *law*. The authors point out that the Stoics did **not** take the view that natural law replaced us as the cause of our choices. They provide an example:

*“Chrysippus ably defended this position by contending that your actions are ‘up to you’ when they come about ‘through you’—when the determining factors of your action are not external circumstances compelling you to act as you do but are instead your own choices grounded in your perception of the options before you.”*

So, Chrysippus also defines free choice as the absence of external coercion. Had he taken other undue influences into account, such as mental illness, then he would have echoed the original definition: free will is when we decide for ourselves what we will do, free of coercion and undue influence.

The Epicureans, on the other hand, appear to presage the quantum indeterminacy issue in their “atomism”. The SEP authors note of the Epicureans:

*“They held that all things (human soul included) are constituted by atoms, whose law-governed behavior fixes the behavior of everything made of such atoms. But they rejected determinism by supposing that atoms, though law-governed, are susceptible to slight ‘swerves’ or departures from the usual paths.”*

***Deception #6 – It’s All Just Physics***

Epicurus’s “atomism” introduces the next deceptive suggestion: that the “laws” of physics are sufficient to explain all events. But the laws of physics cannot even explain simple things like why a car stops at a red light. Between the red light hitting the driver’s eyes and his foot pressing the brake pedal, you’ll find the biological *motivation* to survive and the rational *calculation* that the best way to do this is to stop at the light.

The “laws” of physics are never broken, they are just *incomplete*. This event cannot be explained, for example, without referring to the “Laws of Traffic”, which you will not find in any physics textbook. To explain why the car stopped at a red light, you’ll need all three causal mechanisms: physical, biological, and rational.

A bowling ball placed on a slope will always roll downhill, because an inanimate object has no purpose and no reason. But put a squirrel on that same slope and he will go in any direction that he expects will lead to his next acorn. His behavior is not controlled by gravity, but by an innate purpose to survive, thrive, and reproduce. And, if you put humans on the same spot, they will fell trees to build houses, hunt for food, raise families, build a community, and eventually form a nation.

To recap: The behavior of physical objects will vary according to how they are organized. The behavior of inanimate objects is different from the behavior of living organisms. The behavior of intelligent living organisms is different from that of non-intelligent species.

For the sake of determinism, we will assume that each of the three causal mechanisms is perfectly reliable in its own domain. And that every event that ever happens is the necessary result of some specific *combination* of physical, biological, and/or rational causation. The car’s driver, in our example, is a living organism motivated to survive. The intelligent species has created traffic laws to make driving safer. The driver calculates that things will turn out best if he stops at the red light, so he applies the brakes. That explains why the car stopped at the light.

Physics is quite adequate to explain why a cup of water flows downhill. But it has no clue as to why a similar cup water, heated and mixed with a little coffee, hops into a car and goes grocery shopping.",0,1729456553.0,freewill,0,0.5,False

The next day in the afternoon she tells me she just got some bad news about something and she's gonna be MIA for a bit while she deals with it all. I just told her no worries & to deal with her stuff and I'll be here whenever she needs it. It's been 3 weeks now & besides an update on how she's feeling a bit better now I haven't heard a thing.

","I’ve been no contact with my ex for 10 months after an on-and-off situationship that lasted almost five years. It was emotionally draining, and I’ve worked hard to heal. Out of nowhere, she emailed me, saying she’s in town and asked if we could meet up for coffee, claiming she wants to be “friends.”

Her “apology” was the typical “sorry if I ever hurt you” — which to me felt like she was basically refusing to take full accountability for the years of pain she caused. She even asked to meet “one last time,” but we already did that in December 2023, and it was pointless. Tbh, it felt like she wanted to meet me not really for closure, but for her to feel less guilty for hurting me. 

I told her I’m done — no more meeting, no more reconnection. I feel like she’s just trying to ease her own guilt without truly recognizing what she did. But after sending that email and declining her invitation, it’s me that’s now relapsing emotionally, and all those old wounds are resurfacing.

It would come and go, but lately it’s become pretty much constant, having to take around 4 extra strength anti acids per day. I would take like agonizing 3 week breaks to let my body heal, then start drinking again and it wouldn’t take long for a new bleed to begin. Fresh blood is now in my stool often. She (family doctor) has faxed for an upper and lower endoscopy but unfortunately she has no idea when they will call to book it. So it could be months.

And even though this was right in front of me in the toilet it’s basically become an anxiety defense mechanism to ignore health concerns because they never seem to be real. After many Reddit posts trying to rationalize it, even serious alcoholics have said it is not normal to be vomiting blood that much. It’s really hard to not drink booze as it’s such an everyday part of my life. I caved today, and bought “non grain vodka” because I’m an idiot and google said it was basically the best option for your stomach.

1g88azn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g88azn/crush/,crush👀,"so I’m gonna give the whole backstory and let’s have it out. I’m a (f) college student and I’m trying to explore my sexuality. Im definitely bisexual and know I’m attracted to women. I went out with a girl once three years ago but it didn’t work out because I had feelings for my best friend at the time and so I was emotionally unavailable. We never got past the smooching stage, she said she wanted more and I unfortunately wasn’t ready. 

fast forward and I started dating a 28 year old man and never told him about being interested in girls. we were together for a year and then I got out of the relationship with my ex-boyfriend 5 months ago. my gut wouldn’t stop nagging at me until I ended it with him. during my whole relationship with him there were three times where I found myself crushing on girls from my classes. so since being single I told myself I will put myself out there and ask girls out. 

recently I saw one of those girls at a school event. we had a math class together last fall and I always thought she was so cute and smart. I wanted to run into her and spend some more time with her so I went to the math department study room because she is a math major and It’s the only place I could think to find her. I was hoping that I would get her number that way. I was working on a midterm when my math TA came into the room. We talked and I mentioned I wanted to study abroad in Sweden and she told me she knows a math student who just studied abroad in Sweden last spring and it was her, the girl I was hoping to run into in that study room. Let’s call her Gabby. So my TA asked Gabby if it was okay to give me her number so we could arrange a get together to discuss studying abroad in Sweden(though these weren’t my only hopes and intentions). So I texted Gabby and we arranged to get together. we met up at a coffee shop yesterday and I was trying to prolong the conversation as much as possible, she was so kind, and answered everything on my mind, I made it known I’m queer and vice versa (not in a flirtatious context unfortunately). I tried not to be nervous and to hold eye contact but I think I mumbled my words and looked at anything but her a lot when I spoke. although I told myself that if I found myself into her that I would ask her on a date at the end, I couldn’t work up the courage and just awkwardly thanked her and left. I felt like I didn’t want to be to forward especially since her reason for coming to meet me might’ve not been the same as mine. as I left the coffee shop I was freaking out at myself and being hard on myself for just not being brave enough. 

I really do want to see her again. She texted me shortly after we parted ways about a math club and If I would be interested in joining the group. I lit up with excitement and said absolutely and that’s that. I need help as to what to do to progress this further romantically. I’m very new to this and I know to achieve something with Gabby I should be straightforward and make it known I’m interested in her but I don’t know how or when. Should I wait till the next time I run into her(have no idea when that might be) or should I text her and ask her out. Thank you!! ik this was super long lol I appreciate any answer.

I started a new job that's pretty isolating. My apartment got infested with cockroaches (neighbors are hoarders) to the point I had to move out. I can't break the lease because they send a pest control guy even though it doesn't work because they come through the cracks in the walls. I've been living with a friend luckily but my commute has gone from 20 minutes to over an hour. All I do is wake up, go to work, get ready for bed, rinse and repeat.  My job is staring at a computer for 8 hours a day and on the weekend I stare at the computer for another 10 hours doing college. My boyfriend of 4 years went cold on me and broke up shortly after I moved. (He did not live with me). My friends who witnessed it called it abusive. I think he was just being a jerk. He was manipulative, but not abusive. He just became cruel one day. I think he wanted me to break up with him first. I was pretty blindsided, as just a month before he was mentioning ""when we are married"". I'm blocked everywhere, basically ghosted. Thrown away like I never mattered. He took his belongings out of my apartment a few weeks before we broke up, (I didn't know right away because I'm not living there) so I assume he planned in advance. I only found out because I happened to be over there one day. That relationship was pretty much my entire adult life, 19-23. He was the only person I'd been with.

I've not been coping well. I drink and I binge eat and then I starve to make up for the binge eating. I feel like a loser. I wish I could cry but I can't. Just complete Anhedonia now. I tried to go out with friends and did something extremely stupid. My thought process was ""I don't care what happens to me"" and had 6 drinks in one hour after fasting for a day prior. I blacked out and puked my guts out the following day. I don't remember much, just a guy hitting on me and rubbing my back. I did not reciprocate. I got dragged out of the club by the bouncer because I couldn't walk and then a friend carried my unconscious body into the uber. Why did I do something so stupid? I'd feel ashamed if I could feel anything at all. It was not fun. I felt even emptier.

I feel so ugly and so stupid. I go full 24-hour periods without sleeping. I just lay in my bed and freak the fuck out. Then I go to work and take 2 ritalins and drink about 5 coffees to get through. I don't talk to anybody. My coworkers think I'm weird. I google botox groupons in my free time. I hate myself so much. I hate that I'm ugly and I hate that I'm weird. I feel like im too old. I tried to get back on Tinder because I'm so fucking lonely but I deleted it about an hour later because the idea of talking to anybody else made me feel sick. I was walking to the grocery store the other day and an older man in an expensive car pulled up to me and asked if I wanted to go on a date. I explained I wasn't ready as I'd just broken up. He offered me more than my salary to date him. I feel sick to my stomach but his phone number is still in the console of my car. I did everything I was supposed to in my last relationship and still got disposed of. I am disposable and I did it for free. Why not make some money this time. I am poorer than I've ever been. My car is literally ziptied together at places because I cant afford to take it to the mechanic. My ex-boyfriend crashed it. He promised he'd pay but he never followed through on his promises. I don't like where my life is heading and I don't feel like myself.

Nothing feels real. I feel like I'm dreaming. In just a few months everything has changed. New job, new house, no boyfriend. I am falling behind in school.

Add all ingredients to a shaker and stir with plenty of ice. Serve on a tumbler with a fresh ice cube and garnish with coffee beans, cardamom pods or similar.


For the vanilla syrup I simply added a few drops of vanilla extract to simple syrup (water and sugar 1:1) For the cardamom bitters, I crushed 2 cardamom pods, mixed with simple syrup (as above) and let it sit for 30 mins. Coffee bitters I used homeboy. 


Can't remember where did I get this recipe, may have been this sub or a bar, but found it written down without quantities. Hence the name, so if anyone knows its proper name and source please shame me.
There is a lot to unpack in here, lots of strong beautiful flavors fighting together. Like a brawl in a wedding. The herbal of the ""Chartreuse"" and cardamom come first, followed by the bitter coffee. The sweet rum and maraschino is subtle, almost none, but I guess its part of the drink. After a while the herbal flavor comes back. You certainly can skip a few things (maraschino, good quality dark rum for white rum?) but it won't be the same thing.


In my humble opinion Chartreuse is completely overrated. Downvote and carry on but I'll die on this hill until proven wrong. The thing is, in Europe there are plenty of herb liquors that can easily sub the expensive, elusive and famous liquor. Italy, Spain, France, Sweden... In every little village there will be somebody making a herb liquor that, with its differences, can almost match Chartreuse. Availability and price is key I guess.

I am also located in Europe, while he lives in Canada, so after 1 month of dating he went back home. We never stopped communicating, as a matter of fact, we text and call everyday. We openly talked about becoming a couple despite the distance, so we decided to get to know each other better and decide if we're a good fit for each other. We had a lot of mature conversations, both stating that we are over the partying era, that we are focused on our careers, and we are both looking for someone that wants a family and above all - has moral and ethical values.

**But, I started to notice some red flags & now I am afraid I'm starting to see a pattern. I will list the events chronologically:**

1. When I asked about his job on day 1, he said he's an IT, so I immediately assumed an engineer, to which he replied YES. Days later, I actually find out that he is a business analyst, and honestly I am not clear why would someone lie about this. I have no idea why I didn't confront him about it.
2. Ever since he went back to Canada, he's sending me random photos during our daily talks, for example: of his workplace, supermarket, and pretty much of anything he may be doing daily. BUT, I have noticed inconsistencies, for example: he says he's going to the supermarket and sends a photo (which btw is never demanded from my end), then 20 mins later, he sends me a photo of his in his PJs. This has happened several times, but I didn't want to be rude and be like: WOW in 20 mins you got back from the supermarket and managed to get in your PJs again? Another example: he says that he is at work and send a photo of him in an elevator. An hour later, he send another photo of him going to get coffee, but I noticed his shirt was different, so it can't be from the same day. AND ALLEGEDLY, all of the photos are real-time.
3. We do not sext, but once he sent me a nude of him. I immediately noticed that he didn't have the tattoos on, so I asked: ""Is this before the tattoos?"", to which he replied: ""No, this is real-time photo. Thinking of you xx"". But, it's only been a month since he went back to Canada and I just Googled and found out that tattoos (especially his which are 3 big ones and with very dark ink) cannot be removed in less than a year. Also, it says that between treatments, one needs to wait at least 4 weeks, and that is THE TOTAL time he's been back, so there is no way he had more than 1 treatment and completely erase all 3 tattoos from his body. He also noticed that I wasn't responsive to the sexting, so my opinion is that he invented this ridiculous lie, out of fear not to turn out as a perv if he admitted that the boner photo was an old one, and it wasn't because ""he was thinking of me"". Which is silly, because I would never get upset over an old boner photo.
4. He normally asks me a lot of questions (such as where I am, where I go, and who I am with). Although I was aware that this might be a red flag (meaning he's a controlling person), I was honestly more flattered and saw this as he caring. On the other hand, I always try to stay respectful and even tho I ask him a lot of questions about how he is, and how was his day etc, I never demand to know where did he go, who was he with, etc. ---- leading to point 5
5. Last week, he said that he will travel for 7 hours to another town because ""he will spend some time with his brother and ALSO he needs to meet somebody"". Of course, I did not ask who, out of politeness, but I was bothered by his statement, as I perceived it like he shared it with an intention to make me overthink about who he might be meeting. Ofc I do not appreciate this, because making me interested in him in such a toxic way is a NO-NO for me. I'd rather be interested because of healthy reasons. But I didn't say anything again.
6. When he arrived to this other city, he said he was going out to get dinner (on Friday night). After dinner he texted to say he was at home at 2:30 AM and when I asked how was his day, he only said he was TIRED but didn't describe anything. The next day (Saturday) I FINALLY asked where are you now? He did not answer where he was, but he decided to show me a video of the previous night, which was a festival, and it was really wild. He continued to say, he initially wanted to go out for dinner, but his younger brother who allegedly knew some DJ insisted on going, so poor him - decided to go. I do not have problems with someone going out, but it bothers me that he was lying to me. I do not think that someone would travel for 7 h by car in order to casually end up at a festival. This means, he was lying about wanting to focus on things other than parties.

She will sit in a chair right next to the end of the table where im sitting. I've told her about this but sometimes I think its getting worse.

A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/h0HFFpQ)

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - “hey” does not start a conversation. ",0,1729456053.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

For context, Jim and I started talking as SOON as I got out of a 2 year relationship. I never planned on having feelings, I was just looking for a distraction to move past my abusive relationship. Yes I know that’s not healthy but a girl gotta do, what I girl gotta do.  

When we started talking, I was completely transparent with where I was mentally, and that I was not able to be in anything committed. He understood what I was going through and wanted to continue. He started to heal me, being the kindest, most genuine and giving guy I have met in years.  

I was so damaged, that anything physical made me have a panic attack, I couldn’t give him words of affirmation. I essentially only gave friendship. 

Now fast forward, 4 months we finally progressed with meeting the odd family member and being able to be physical without panic. Paired with exclusivity without the label of dating. I still really struggle with giving him words of affirmation and assurance. 

The past month ALL he wants to do is talk about feelings, like once or twice a week. I simply have nothing to say. I don’t want to talk about how much I like him. I don’t want to talk about feeling at all, I simply want to enjoy the progress of what we have made and have fun. I have clear communication this, multiple times. 

Throughout the past month of him talking about feelings, I’ve learnt that he still has a lot of past relationship trauma with his ex cheating on him. I’ve told him before it is not fair for him to put past relationship trauma onto someone new and vice versa. 

I have a handful of guy friends that have clear boundaries. Last night, Jim and I were having a couple drinks and making dinner. I told him my phone password so he could be the DJ. Shortly after I got a Snapchat from a guy friend, Jim decided to open it. It was a semi flirtatious meme. Jim then confronted me and told me that this guy wants to be more than friends and kind of bitched me out. I told Jim that clearly this friend needed a refresher on the boundaries or else I would dispose of him. 

Although he agreed, he just kept talking and talking about it and how he’s been through this so many times. How damaged he was blah blah blah. Mans was practically in tears (I don’t think the drinks were helping lol) 

At this point I was silent just letting him vent because I was so angry! The one time I give him trust, he goes through my phone. I was pissed that he was projecting his past relationship on me. Like broooo you’ve had two plus year to heal, I’ve had 4 months to heal and now I’m getting more emotional baggage put on my shoulders. He didn’t give me a chance to correct the situation. 

He ended up sleeping over because he was too drunk to drive. All he wanted to do was cuddle and stuff. I felt his boner all night and his man sweat all over my freshly washed sheets. I kicked him out in the morning with a coffee and lunch but I’m pissed. I had no words for him beside me thanking him for the gifts and told him I need space.  

Long story short, we leave for Hawaii in a week to a very high end resort for 2 weeks and I don’t know if I wanna go any more. I’m emotionally drained and I’m sick of having deep conversations. But on the other hand, he’s essentially all I’ve ever wanted. I can’t even describe the amount of effort and thought he puts into everything.

I'd also love some good restaurant and coffee shop recommendations if you're local!

A little about me:

Overall I'm pretty mellow and easygoing. I'm definitely more introverted but always down to try new things. Especially new restaurants, coffee shops, and cocktail bars! I get along well with most people and I really love talking to people about things their passionate about!

I have a pretty big variety of interests and hobbies. My main hobby is houseplants and planted aquariums. I'm working on designing a 7 gallon tank now. I have quite a few ideas for it is love to talk about! My goal is one day to have a cool workshop space where I can have all my projects! I also enjoy reading, I recently finished The Midnight Library and I'm working my way through the Game of Thrones books.

I don't play a ton of video games but I do enjoy grand strategy and citybuilders. I mainly watch sci-fi and fantasy TV shows although I'm getting into anime more. I just started the new season of House of the Dragon. I love a good podcast too! I listen to a mix of science, news, and everything in between. My current favorite is Search Engine.

I’m talking no candy bars, cookies, ice cream, that kind of stuff. It was really easy actually, I quit soda 10 or so years ago and that was a breeze. 

I recently gave in and ate a few munchkins and a slice of cheesecake the same day. The next day out of nowhere, I felt extremely depressed. Like, debilitated. I was fighting tears the whole day, couldn’t get motivated to do my hobbies. 

I didn’t make the connection that I hadn’t felt this way since before I quit sugar until hours later. Definitely not giving in again…

“I’m not,” Arthur says, strangled.

“Clearly,” says the stranger in an oddly cheerful tone, and sticks out his hand. “I’m Merlin. I can keep this very short. I’ve spent four years as a barista in another coffee shop, then went to art school, failed utterly and horribly, and now I’m back to being a barista. I’m a hard worker and am immune to people shouting at me, because I’m a starving artist, which means I know how to deal with negative feedback very well. So. That’s me. I didn’t bring a CV, sorry.”

I had stayed up late the previous night due to a nonsensical pursuit of one form or another. My memory fails me now. I walked in well after 8 which was unlike me. There was a fresh pot of coffee steaming proudly, infusing the whole place with the characteristic arabica aroma, pleasant and indifferent, but proudly indulgent. I grabbed a cup and filled it. Over by open bay window, a solo ray of light peeked through, the south easterly orientation only allowing an ever so gradual revelation of light, a quota system if you may. An architectural indulgence or a happy little error. It is my favorite spot.

The place was eerily quiet. And empty. This in itself was extremely peculiar. Mamasan played music from opening to closing. She played everything. From Busta Rhymes to Bach.

Well, after realizing that bantering about the weather with strangers in line to get coffee wasn't working, I decided to give the internet a try, haha.

So, here I am—hoping to click with someone else who enjoys a good laugh, can appreciate a decent pun, and doesn't mind debating the merits of soft vs. crunchy peanut butter (crunchy all the way!). 

**Here's a bit about me:**

* I'm 34, male, single, childfree, and from the Northeast US.
* I work in higher ed, which means I can casually throw around terms like ""pedagogy"" and get paid to make students think I know everything (don’t tell them I don’t!).
* Hiking is my jam. I'm basically a mountain goat in human form (not really), except I come with snacks and a questionable sense of direction. If you're into epic trails and occasional ""oops, wrong way"" moments, we're a match.
* Journaling is my form of therapy. My notebooks are filled with deep thoughts, random doodles, and the occasional grocery list. I like to think of it as a sophisticated form of multitasking (or maybe an old-fashioned way of multitasking—who knows?).
* I love taking drives. There's nothing like the thrill of the open road, especially when my GPS decides to spice things up with surprise scenic routes through the middle of nowhere.
* I savor the little things in life, like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, a well-timed joke, or finding a parking spot right in front of the store. It’s the small victories that count, right?
* I like to think that I'm as down to earth as they come. Literally, I’ve tripped on flat surfaces more times than I’d care to admit. But hey, at least I'm grounded, right?
* I firmly believe tacos are the answer to all of life’s problems. If you think Taco Tuesday should be a daily event, we’ll get along just fine. (Well... not exactly daily, but you get the point).

**What's important to me:**

* ***Someone who has a sense of curiosity about life:*** I'm looking for someone who truly sees the world as a playground of possibilities. If you’re the kind of person who loves learning new things, exploring different perspectives, and embracing the adventure of life, we’re definitely on the same wavelength. I want someone who’s always up for a new experience or discovering something interesting.
* ***Someone who loves day trips:*** I love spontaneous day trips, whether it’s a hike, a visit to a quirky town, or just a scenic drive. I’m hoping to find someone who shares that same enthusiasm for exploring and making the most of every weekend. There’s something special about discovering new places and making memories together, and I’m excited to find a partner who values those adventures as much as I do.
* ***Someone who values authentic conversations and growth:*** Genuine, meaningful conversations are the backbone of any strong relationship. I’m looking for someone who’s open, honest, and values deep discussions about life, dreams, and everything in between. I believe lifelong growth means constantly evolving and supporting each other’s journeys, and I’d like to find someone who shares that belief.
* ***Someone who sees the purpose of self-reflection:***  I’m drawn to those who regularly take the time to look inward and understand themselves better—striving to be the best version of yourself and appreciating the journey of self-discovery.

**And that's a wrap!**

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You now know more about me than most people do after a first date. If you think we’d get along like peanut butter and jelly (or pineapple and pizza if you’re on the right side of history), drop me a message.

If you're struggling with an opener, here are a couple of fun ones (don't worry, I like to think of myself as a great conversationalist, so I can take it from there, haha): 

* If we went hiking together, would you be the snack master or the trail guide?
* Coffee: are you a one-cup wonder or do you need a caffeine IV drip?

Hope this post made you laugh! I look forward to hopefully connecting with someone who loves life, laughter, and a good road trip as much as I do.",1,1729455574.0,cf4cf,0,0.67,False

I am looking for a long term relationship with someone who's interested in thinking of cool ideas and being productive together.

Stuff I like: Arduino/Raspberry Pi, 3D design/printing/CNC, Smart Home/Appliance, etc.

I like thinking about sustainability/energy conservation - Wind turbines, EVs, Motor/generators etc. Also wouldn't mind having an RV living project in the future.

A little about me:

I'm 5'6, about 135lbs, skinny yet muscular. Short brown hair, brown eyes, scruffy beard of varying lengths. I pretty much wear jeans or shorts and a t-shirt everyday, and I'm pretty cute. Ask me for a pic!

I don't really drink aside from a few social beers now and then, 420 is okay, but no cigarettes.. I prefer classic rock music than any music on the radio today, I have a cat, I like coffee, I play guitar, drums, and ukulele, I work on my own car, I'm pretty progressive, non-religious, oh and I hope to have a kid or two someday. (maybe I should've lead with that)

Some stuff I look for in a potential partner:

I like shorter girls with an alternative/tomboy or not as feminine vibe. Someone with liberal views, monogamous, and wants a family. Ideally likes 60's and 70's music. Preferably has or are working towards a degree (not a deal breaker), maybe engineering, CS, or some other STEM major. Preferably ambitious and independent.

Maybe you're just like me and would rather wait to find someone truly compatible than to hook up with just anyone who give us attention. If so, we might be looking for each other!

So if you think we'd get along, message me! =) Send a little intro with your age, location, and your favorite class in school, so I know you read the post.",1,1729455498.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1g87zrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1g87zrl/im_frustrated_with_my_work_crush/,I’m frustrated with my work crush ,"Long story…. But hope you guys can help me understand? Would appreciate some advice. 

He is a work crush. I recently joined the dep and he’s from a different team same department. I see him every day. 

I fell for him HARD! When I seen him. After that I just stare intensely. 

I got the courage to ask him out. He said he was seeing someone else. I think he was in shock, because it was sudden. But now he knows I like him. 

Anyways I’ve been over a month now. I don’t feel like he is with that person or seeing anymore. 

He stares at me back too. Every day when he’s in the office as he sometimes wfh. He has also initiated conversation at the kitchen area with me Untill another colleague butted in…. However that day, he stood next to me, really close in my personal space. He could have moved to the other side of the kitchen unit, or moved away from me. But, it felt so amazing being so close to him, having this intense energy and connection without saying anything to eachother. I definitely know he feels it too. 

I get really shy and nervous around him, tripped up, slipped up, everything. We check eachother out, all the time. He cannot look away, now it’s become really intense…. I want to deepen our connection and idk how to do it, I want to get to know him better too. Make conversation but I get so shy. Because although he never said no to me, I can’t get the confidence to talk to him because it’s still a rejection. 

I am a confident person, very attractive, great fashion style and definitely not out of his league. Normally I would say I’m way better and can do better, but tbh our attraction and looks are on the same wavelength. If I look like Karen Gillian with black hair, he looks like Jamie dornan…. We’re both hot! But, 

I’m fustrated he won’t ask me out….he doesn’t avoid me. When you ask someone out and they realise you like them and they are not interested, they do everything to avoid you. 

He walks past me, he looks at me when he does. When I look at him he looks away, he looks at my screen to find out what music I’m playing, he whistles past me… he stares at me intensely and I do him to. We have awkwardly smiled at eachother. I teams messaged him, to use coffee from his cabinet and he goes it’s fine for me to use his. Then he smiled at me. It’s crazy how much I like him and how flustered I get around him. He’s annoying if he likes me back why won’t he act on it? Argh honestly guys need more fricking confidence! 

Do you guys think he likes me? ",1,1729455495.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1g87ued,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1g87ued/the_endless_road/,The Endless Road,"You ever have one of those moments where you question if what’s happening to you is real? Like, not just a bad dream, but something deeper? Something that makes you wonder if your entire reality is just… wrong?

I don’t tell many people this, but a few months ago, something happened to me. Something I still can’t explain, and the more I try to figure it out, the more lost I feel. Maybe talking about it will help, but honestly, I’m not sure anymore.

It started on a Friday night, late—around 1 AM. I was driving home from a friend’s place. The streets were dead quiet, and I was just listening to the hum of my engine and the occasional static from the radio. It was one of those nights where everything feels surreal, like the world is asleep and you’re the only one left.

I was only a few miles from home when I saw it. A car on the side of the road, hazard lights flashing. It was a dark sedan, looked pretty old, and there was a guy standing next to it, waving me down. I should’ve kept driving. I don’t know why I didn’t. I mean, it was late, middle of nowhere, and something about the way he was waving felt… off. But I pulled over.

The guy looked normal enough, wearing a jacket, jeans, but when I rolled down my window, he just stared at me for a second—like he wasn’t expecting me to stop.

“Everything okay?” I asked.

He blinked, as if coming out of a trance, and nodded. “Yeah, yeah. Uh, my car broke down. Think you could give me a ride to the gas station?”

Now, normally I’m cautious. But something about him made me feel like I had to help. Like there was no other option. So I unlocked the door, and he got in.

We didn’t talk much. He didn’t tell me his name, and I didn’t ask. But after a few minutes, I started feeling… weird. Like I was being watched, but not by him. By something else. I glanced in my rearview mirror, and for a split second, I swear I saw someone in the backseat. Just a shape—barely there, but enough to make my heart race.

I didn’t say anything. I just kept driving.

Then, about five minutes in, the guy turns to me and says, “I’ve been here before.”

“What?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He looked at me, his face completely blank. “This exact drive. This exact moment. You picked me up before.”

I laughed nervously, thinking maybe he was messing with me. “Yeah, I doubt that. Must’ve been someone else.”

He shook his head slowly. “No. It was you. And I’ll prove it.”

That’s when he started describing things. Not just general stuff, but specific details. He knew what I had in my glove compartment—a receipt from a coffee shop I’d been to earlier that day. He described the air freshener hanging from my mirror, the little tear in the fabric of my passenger seat.

I hadn’t shown him any of that. There’s no way he could’ve known.

My stomach was in knots, and I wanted to pull over, kick him out, but something kept me driving. I felt trapped, like no matter what I did, I had to keep going.

Then, he said something that still chills me to the bone. “This is the part where you try to drop me off at the gas station, but you never make it.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked, my voice shaking now. I glanced at the GPS. The gas station was only a mile away. I could see the lights up ahead.

He smiled, this slow, creeping smile that made my skin crawl. “You’ve already done this. Over and over again. Every time you try to get there, something happens. Something stops you. And you end up right back where you started.”

I didn’t believe him. I couldn’t. But when I looked at the road ahead, something changed. The gas station lights flickered, and then… they were gone. The road stretched out endlessly in front of me, no buildings, no signs, just darkness. Like the world had shifted, and I was the only one who noticed.

“I don’t understand,” I muttered, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.

“You’re stuck,” he said softly. “You’ve been stuck for a long time. You just don’t remember.”

I slammed on the brakes, heart pounding, and turned to face him. But he wasn’t there. The passenger seat was empty.

I stared, my breath coming in shallow gasps. How the hell could he have just disappeared? I looked around, frantically searching for any sign of him. But then I noticed something even worse.

The road outside my window… I recognized it. But not from earlier in the night. From last week. Last month. It was the same stretch of road I’d been driving on every Friday for the past few months, on my way home from my friend’s place. Always late at night. Always alone.

I slammed the gas pedal, trying to get back to the city, to any sign of life. But the road just kept stretching on, endlessly. I felt like I was driving for hours, but nothing changed. It was as if the world outside the car didn’t exist anymore—just an infinite loop of the same road, the same dark horizon.

And then my phone buzzed. I fumbled for it, nearly dropping it in my panic. There was a new message from an unknown number. It said:

“Welcome back.”

That’s when I knew. I’d been here before. Just like he said. And I’ll be here again.

So now I’m telling you—whoever’s listening to this—if you ever find yourself driving late at night, and you see someone stranded on the side of the road… don’t stop. Keep going. No matter what you feel, no matter how much you think they need help—don’t stop.

Because once you do… you’re never getting out.",3,1729455114.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False
