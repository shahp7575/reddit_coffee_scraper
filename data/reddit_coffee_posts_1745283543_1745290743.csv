by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the KIA Tigers versus the Samsung Lions‚Äîa matchup as classic as peanut butter and jelly, or in this case, kimchi and rice. The Tigers are eagerly awaiting the return of their prodigal son, Kim Do-young, whose absence has been felt like a missing sock in a laundry load. With the team batting a paltry .239, it's clear they've been swinging more like kittens than Tigers.

Kim's return is expected to inject some much-needed adrenaline into the Tigers' lineup, and not a moment too soon. The Tigers are sitting at 6th place with an 11-12 record, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee. But fear not, Tigers fans, for Kim's return is imminent, and with it, the promise of a revitalized offense.

Now, let's talk odds. The Samsung Lions are the favorites here, with odds of 1.67 at Bovada, while the Tigers are the underdogs at 2.15. Given the Tigers' current form, it's no surprise the Lions are favored. However, if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for underdog stories, placing a bet on the Tigers could be your ticket to glory‚Äîor at least a decent payout.

For those who prefer a more conservative approach, the spread has the Tigers at +1.5 with odds of 1.61. This might be the safer bet if you believe Kim's return will at least keep the game close.

As for the total, the line is set at 11.0, and with Kim's return potentially sparking the Tigers' offense, the ""Over"" at 1.8 might just be the way to go. After all, nothing says ""welcome back"" quite like a high-scoring affair.

In summary, if you're feeling lucky and believe in the power of a comeback, take the Tigers at 2.15. If you're more of a cautious cat, consider the spread or the over. Either way, grab your popcorn, because this game promises to be as thrilling as a K-drama finale.

The entire planet is a living office, populated mostly by clones of intern John Oaf, who has already been dead for 150 years. He was selected as the cloning template because he spilled coffee on the visiting CEO of the time on a branch office world.

His memories were modified to serve as a perfect cookie cutter template for customer service. Clones are used instead of machine intelligences due to costs and the customer demand for a ""human"" element.

All office spaces and cubicles are air conditioned, which supplies aerosolized caffeine to make the Johns more efficient. Johns are given 7 hours of sleep everyday to ensure peak efficiency during the other 17 hours of work. They sleep in pods next to their office spaces, where nitrous oxide is used as a sedative to force them to sleep, even under the effects of caffeine.

During the cloning process, all Johns are implanted with the modified memories and a nutrient and waste tank, removing the need to eat, drink, or take bathroom breaks. The tanks are cleared and refilled each time in the sleeping pods.

Johns vary in lifespan due to variations in the cloning process. Some clones are more stable, resistant to nitrous oxide poisoning and age less, increasing their operational life to a decade or more. Some clones can also become ""disagreeable"". These clones are taken away and dissolved, their organic matter to be recycled into new Johns. The average John has a service life of about 6 years and are all recycled once they are no longer efficient employees.

**The condition:** Everything you eat from here until the end of your life must be from a McDonald's. Everything you drink (aside from a couple of exemptions - see below) must also be from a McDonald's. 

**Additional Details:** You have a free pass to take the McDonald's food anywhere: sports stadiums, movie theaters, other restaurants, airplanes, etc - these establishments will allow you to bring it in with you even if they have policies against such things normally. So if you are having a date with a spouse or friends, you can still go to dinner with them, but you'll need to stop by a McDonald's (or have someone pick it up for you) beforehand and take the food in with you (or, simply not eat).

**Liquids:** Most liquids are included in this rule, with two exceptions: 1) Water and 2) Alcohol-based drinks (beer, wine, spirits, mead, hard seltzers) are exempt from the rule. So you can still get your water from anywhere and you can still consume any alcohol-based drink. But every other liquid: juice, coffee, smoothies, milkshakes, etc must be purchased from a McDonalds. 

**Violation:** If you violate the rule, you will be killed immediately. Say you're at a cocktail party and have a brain fart for a moment, or maybe you had too much to drink, and you decide to take a bite of the food at the party - you will be killed immediately. 

**Things to consider:**

\- In the unlikely event that McDonald's goes out of business in your lifetime, you're SOL and will starve to death.

\- Travel - you will need to ensure that any country you travel to has McDonald's locations that are easily accessible, or just plan on not eating for the entirety of the trip (humans can survive surprisingly long without food, but it will be difficult). 

\- Given that you are now a billionaire, you should have ample resources to have a delivery driver at your disposal 24/7 that can bring you food from McDonald's at any time, no matter where you are (assuming you are close-ish to a McDonald's location)

\- McDonald's has heart-healthy options (ie salads), but there will still be adverse health effects from eating fast food every day - on the other hand, you will have access to the best healthcare money can buy.

So are you taking the $1 Billion and eating McD's for the rest of your life?",4,1745289571.0,hypotheticalsituation,20,0.75,False

1k4vp5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JointPain101/comments/1k4vp5a/how_to_use_avocado_seed_for_joint_pain/,How To Use Avocado Seed For Joint Pain,"How to Use Avocado Seed for Joint Pain: Effective Methods and Benefits
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Joint pain is a common problem affecting millions worldwide, often caused by arthritis, injury, or inflammation. Many people look for natural remedies that provide relief without harsh chemicals or side effects. One surprising yet effective solution comes from an unexpected source: the avocado seed. While most people discard this part of the fruit, avocado seed contains beneficial compounds that can help reduce joint discomfort and improve mobility.

### Why Avocado Seed Helps with Joint Pain

The avocado seed is rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and essential nutrients. These elements work together to fight inflammation and support joint health. Inflammation is a primary cause of pain and stiffness in joints, so reducing it can provide significant relief. Additionally, avocado seeds contain fiber and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and phenolic compounds that promote overall wellbeing and cellular repair.

Scientific studies have shown that extracts from avocado seed can inhibit inflammatory pathways and reduce oxidative stress in the body. Oxidative stress damages joint cartilage and tissues, accelerating joint issues like osteoarthritis. By protecting cells from this damage, avocado seed helps maintain joint structure and function.

### Preparing Avocado Seed for Use

To use avocado seed for joint pain, it needs to be prepared properly to extract the beneficial compounds. Follow these steps to make an effective avocado seed remedy:

1. **Remove and Clean the Seed:** After eating the avocado, take out the seed and wash it thoroughly to remove any fruit residue.
2. **Dry the Seed:** Let the seed dry for a few days in a cool, dry place. This makes it easier to grind.
3. **Remove the Outer Skin:** The seed has a thin brown skin that can be peeled off once dried to improve taste and texture.
4. **Grind into Powder:** Use a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor to crush the dried seed into a fine powder.
 
The powder can be stored in an airtight container for future use.

### Effective Ways to Use Avocado Seed for Joint Relief

There are several ways to incorporate avocado seed into your wellness routine. Here are the most popular and effective methods:

#### 1. Avocado Seed Tea

One of the easiest ways to use avocado seed for joint pain is by brewing a herbal tea. The warm tea helps soothe inflamed joints and lets your body absorb the antioxidants.

- Boil 1 to 2 teaspoons of avocado seed powder in 2 cups of water.
- Simmer for 10-15 minutes, then strain the mixture.
- Drink this tea once or twice daily for best results.
 
#### 2. Avocado Seed Smoothie Booster

Adding avocado seed powder to your smoothie is a nutritious way to support joint health while enjoying your favorite drink.

- Add 1 teaspoon of avocado seed powder to your morning smoothie.
- Blend with fruits, leafy greens, and a liquid base such as almond milk or water.
- Consume regularly to benefit from its anti-inflammatory properties.
 
#### 3. Topical Avocado Seed Paste

For targeted joint pain relief, you can make a paste from avocado seed powder to apply directly on the affected area.

- Mix avocado seed powder with a small amount of water or coconut oil to form a thick paste.
- Gently rub the paste onto painful joints.
- Leave it on for 20-30 minutes and then rinse off.
- Repeat this process 2-3 times a week for noticeable improvements.
 
### Additional Tips to Maximize Benefits

To get the most out of using avocado seed for joint pain, consider combining it with a healthy lifestyle:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help flush toxins and support joint lubrication.
- **Maintain a Balanced Diet:** Include anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric, ginger, fatty fish, and leafy greens.
- **Exercise Regularly:** Low-impact activities such as swimming, walking, or yoga enhance joint mobility and reduce stiffness.
- **Avoid Excessive Strain:** Protect your joints from overuse or injury by using proper posture and supportive footwear.
 
### Precautions When Using Avocado Seed

Although avocado seeds are natural, it‚Äôs important to use them safely:

- **Start Small:** Begin with small amounts to see how your body reacts.
- **Consult a Doctor:** Especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or on medication.
- **Use Clean Seeds:** Always use seeds from ripe, fresh avocados to avoid contaminants.
 
Avocado seed into your joint pain relief regimen can be a simple and cost-effective natural approach. With its rich anti-inflammatory and antioxidant content, this overlooked part of the avocado offers promising benefits. By preparing it correctly and using it consistently, you may experience reduced pain and increased joint comfort over time.

</div>Understanding the Nutritional Components of Avocado Seed That Aid Joint Health
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>The avocado seed, often discarded, is a powerhouse of nutrients that can be surprisingly beneficial for joint health. While many focus on the creamy flesh of the avocado, the seed contains a variety of compounds that may help reduce inflammation and support joint function. Understanding these nutritional components helps you appreciate the potential of avocado seeds in managing joint pain and promoting overall joint wellness.

### Rich in Antioxidants

One of the key reasons avocado seeds support joint health is their high antioxidant content. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals‚Äîunstable molecules that cause oxidative stress and contribute to inflammation in joints. By reducing oxidative damage, antioxidants play a crucial role in decreasing swelling and pain associated with conditions like arthritis.

Avocado seeds contain phenolic compounds and flavonoids, both powerful antioxidants that protect joint tissues from damage. Including these antioxidants in your diet can help slow down joint degeneration and improve mobility.

### Abundant in Fiber

Fiber in avocado seeds is another important component that indirectly benefits joint health. A high-fiber diet supports gut health by promoting a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Research suggests a strong link between gut health and inflammation; when your gut is healthy, the immune system functions better, potentially reducing autoimmune joint conditions.

- **Soluble fiber:** Slows digestion, helping control blood sugar levels, which is important to prevent inflammation spikes.
- **Insoluble fiber:** Aids in regular bowel movements, ensuring toxin elimination and reducing their build-up in joints.
 
Adding avocado seed powder or extracts to your meals can increase your daily fiber intake, supporting your body's natural ability to fight inflammation.

### Beneficial Fatty Acids

While the seed is not as fatty as the avocado flesh, it still contains trace amounts of healthy fats like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). These fats help reduce inflammation in the body, which directly benefits joints. MUFAs contribute to lowering levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, thereby easing joint pain and stiffness.

Regular consumption of nutrients from avocado seeds alongside whole avocado can provide a balanced intake of anti-inflammatory fats and essential nutrients for joint care.

### Presence of Essential Micronutrients

Micronutrients such as magnesium, calcium, and potassium present in avocado seeds are essential for maintaining healthy joints and bones. Here's why they matter:

- **Magnesium:** Plays a key role in muscle relaxation and reducing cramps around the joints.
- **Calcium:** Important for maintaining strong bones that support joints.
- **Potassium:** Helps regulate fluid balance and prevent joint swelling.
 
By incorporating avocado seed into your routine, you naturally boost your intake of these minerals, assisting in joint strength and flexibility.

### Anti-inflammatory Plant Compounds

Avocado seeds are rich in unique plant compounds such as tannins and alkaloids, which have natural anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds help reduce joint inflammation by inhibiting enzymes that contribute to swelling and pain. Their natural origin means fewer side effects compared to synthetic medications.

Using avocado seed extracts or powders can be a safe, complementary approach to managing inflammation from joint disorders such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

### How to Utilize Avocado Seed for Joint Health

To benefit from the nutritional components of avocado seed, here are some practical ways to use it:

- **Dry and grind:** Remove the seed, dry it thoroughly, and grind into powder. This powder can be added to smoothies, soups, or teas.
- **Make tea:** Boil crushed avocado seeds in water for 10-15 minutes. Strain and drink the tea daily to receive anti-inflammatory benefits.
- **Use in supplements:** Some companies produce avocado seed extract supplements specifically aimed at supporting joint health.
 
When incorporating avocado seed into your diet, start with small amounts to assess tolerance. Always consult with a healthcare provider if you have any underlying health conditions or are on medication.

Understanding the nutritional richness of avocado seeds reveals why they can be a valuable natural aid for joint health. Their antioxidant, fiber, fatty acid, mineral, and anti-inflammatory properties collectively work to reduce joint pain and improve mobility‚Äîmaking avocado seed a worthy addition to your joint care regimen.

</div>### Conclusion

Using avocado seed for joint pain offers a natural and accessible way to support your joint health. By incorporating methods like making avocado seed powder or a soothing tea, you can tap into the seed‚Äôs anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These methods are simple to prepare and can be easily included in your daily routine, providing relief from stiffness and discomfort associated with joint pain.

The key to avocado seed‚Äôs effectiveness lies in its rich nutritional profile. It contains compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and dietary fiber, which work together to reduce inflammation and protect the cartilage that cushions your joints. These nutrients help improve mobility and may contribute to long-term joint health by slowing down the wear and tear caused by conditions like arthritis.

When you choose to use avocado seed as a natural remedy, you are opting for a holistic approach that complements traditional treatments. As with any health practice, consistency matters, so regular use can enhance the benefits and support your overall joint well-being. Always remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially if you have existing health conditions.

By utilizing the avocado seed‚Äôs powerful nutrients and easy-to-follow preparation methods, you give yourself a natural edge in managing joint pain. This simple addition to your wellness routine could help reduce discomfort and improve the quality of your movements, letting you enjoy daily activities with greater ease and comfort.",1,1745289304.0,JointPain101,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs gonna be largely obvious to you if you already now why AI agents are much more capable than Zapier.

You need a perfect cup of coffee‚Äîright now. Do you press a pod machine or call a 20‚Äëyear barista who can craft anything from a warehouse of beans and syrups? Today‚Äôs automation developers face the same choice.

Zapier and the like are so huge and dominant in the RPA/automation industry because they absolutely nailed deterministic workflows‚Äîvery well defined workflows with if-then logic. Sure they can inject some reasoning into those workflows by putting an LLM at some point to pick between branches of a decision tree or produce a ""tailored"" output like a personalized email. However, there's still a world of automation that's untouched and hence the hundreds of millions of people doing routine office work: the world of dynamic workflows.

Dynamic workflows require creativity and reasoning such that when given a set of inputs and a broadly defined objective, they require using whatever relevant tools available in the digital world‚Äîincluding making several decisions about the best way to achieve said objective along the way. This requires research, synthesizing ideas, adapting to new information, and the ability to use different software tools/applications on a computer/the internet. This is territory Zapier and co can never dream of touching with their current set of technologies. This is where AI comes in.

LLMs are gaining increasingly ridiculous amounts of intelligence, but they don't have the tooling to interact with software systems/applications in real world. That's why MCP (Model context protocol, an emerging spec that lets LLMs call app‚Äëlevel actions) is so hot these days. MCP gives LLMs some tooling to interact with whichever software applications support these MCP integrations. Essentially a Zapier-like framework but on steroids. The real question is what would it look like if AI could go even further?

Top tier automation means interacting with all the software systems/applications in the accessible digital world the same way a human could, but being able to operate 24/7¬†x¬†365 with zero loss in focus or efficiency. The final prerequisite is the intelligence/alignment needs to be up to par. This notion currently leads the R&D race among big AI labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance, etc. to produce AI that can use computers like we can: Computer-Use Agents.

OpenAI's computer-use/Anthropic's computer-use are a solid proof of concept but they fall short due to hallucinations or getting confused by unexpected pop-ups/complex screens. However, if they continue to iterate and improve in intelligence, we're talking about unprecedented quantities of human capital replacement. A highly intelligent technology capable of booting up a computer and having access to all the software/applications/information available to us throughout the internet is the first step to producing next level human-replacing automations.

Although these computer use models are not the best right now, there's probably already a solid set of use cases in which they are very much production ready. It's only a matter of time before people figure out how to channel this new AI breakthrough into multi-industry changing technologies. After a couple iterations of high magnitude improvements to these models, say hello to a brand new world where developers can easily build huge teams of veteran baristas with unlimited access to the best beans and syrups.",1,1745288913.0,ComputerAgents,0,1.0,False
1k4vke2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k4vke2/aio_gf_went_on_coffee_date_with_guy_friend/,"AIO ? GF went on coffee ""date"" with guy friend","Hey everyone ! I never thought i would ever do a post on this sub reddit since so far i always manged on my own by talking to my partner and having and open minded conversation but i really need a third opionon on this so see if im either just overreacting/overthinking this whole thing. (Sorry for some grammar mistakes im advance, english is not my first language)

So a bit of back story: I (28) have been with my girlfriend (24) for a bit over 1 year. Everything has been going great and we both harmonize really well. She had previous situationships but acccodring to her im her first real boyfriend. I on the other hand had a few serious releationship before her, including one where i got cheated on. I was 19 when this happend and even though it was nothing major and i didnd get any ""trauma from it, it still made me a bit wary of certain things.

We both meet at eachother at my old working place, she was a cook and i was working at the front (yes i know very clich√©). Working in a male dominated business and her being an attractive woman its not umsual for her to get hit on often. I trust my girlfriend and in my opinion i dont see any harm in a little bit of banter between the opposite sex or her having several guy friends, as long as it stays in line and i expext her to be open about it, meaning its ok to meet other guys or have other guy friends but i expext her to be open and honest about them. So here come the problem where im not quite sure what to do with myself. 

She uses Snapchat, which i admit i have some wierd feelings about but that might just be me being old and out of date. Early on the in the relationship i ""caught"" her sending a dude selfie while she was at my house and she was only wearing a towel after the shower. I instantyl confronted her and told her that im not okey with that, she apologized and i do believe her that it was more of a in the moment snap and it wasnt ment to be seductive. However what bothered me more about this situation is not the picture itself but that she mentioned a name which i have never heard before. As mentioned im fine her having guy friends but i think its fair that i at least know a little bit who they are or know their name. That whole situation passed with no harsh feelings since people do make mistakes and im not perfect either.

I have to add our releationship is otherwise going great. I really do believe thay she loves me and i love her as well but small things like that snapchat situation and other smaller things sometimes just leave a bit of a bitter taste.

Fast forward to yesterday, we had a random conversation where i said something about about trust and for some reason that made her confess that about two weeks ago she went to grab a drink with a guy, who she worked with and when she was on the way home he texted her saying something along the lines of ""if she didnt have a bf, he would have definitely asked her out and tried something"" he deleted the message but my gf saw it and responded saying that because of that she cant be friends with him.
My problem here is not that she went out to drink something with another dude but again that it is name which i have never heaerd before as well as that she didnt tell me when this happened. Additonally she didnt block him even after him.confessing this but only did so when he started liking vacation picture of her and i, since she said she found it creepy that he only likes picture where im on it. 

When she told me this yesterday i didnt really say much since i was kinda caught off guard, i managed to say that she knows where her boundaries are and i expexct her to follow those but didnt investiagte anyfurther but went for long walk instead. I am going to talk her again today about but wanted to hear your guyses opinion/input as well first.

My approach would have been as follows: i go talk her today mentioning the conversation from yesterday and explaining my point of view first that because of my history of beint cheated on i might be a little bit senstive with those kind of topics. I would explain how i wished she would have told me instantly when it happened and i want to know her thought process of only blocking him later even after he confessee ""his love"". 

My question to you guys and girls is, when youre reading this do you see an insecure guy who just needs to get more confident with himself and get over it since nothing really happened and i do admit i sometimes have a hard time getting over those things or would you also confront her about it and if yes in the same way or would you add something ? I dont want to bring up old situations up in the conversation susch as early snapcbat ""incident"" since i think it would be unfair including something we both agreeed on we talked about and put behind us.

I dont want to forbid her having guy friend and i dont want to forbide her using snapchat or whatver she chooses to use but i does always leave a wierd feeling when i see her use the app if that makes sense.... i want to just have a normal releationship without those weird thoughts in the back of my head but im also aware that this requires work from my side as well.

I know it always difficult giving an opinion from such a small text but i hope ill get some good inputs how to approach the situation or if im overreacting how i can managed to handle my feelings better.",3,1745288908.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Howdy! I'm looking for real, honest, open, emotionally connected friendships. I kind of resent small talk, but understand that it's necessary. Conversation has to flow but we gotta share the effort here.

I‚Äôm 27 (as of the day you're probably seeing this), huge lesbian, very neurodivergent, and a little too poetic for my own good.

**The surface-level stuff:**

I love my morning coffee outside, soaking in nature in pretty places, niche Pinterest boards, themed playlists, and absurd memes. Bonus points if you love yelling about and analyzing art and media. Music, movies, and video games are my major hobbies. Usually obscure bands, horror, and Warframe/Pokemon respectively. You can usually find me hanging around r/LetGirlsHaveFun and r/SillyGirlClub. Often called multifaceted and you'll never find me stuck in one box. Variety is the spice of life kinda gal.
Self-identified stoner, but cutting back (2 weeks off as of today!)((ok I smoked today but it's my birthday!!)). 

**The deep stuff:**

Working hard to try to improve my mental health and feel more present. I‚Äôve got a lot of feelings, but also always trying to be silly and light-hearted. I feel things very deeply and always have something bubbling under the surface. If you're someone who gets that, we might vibe. I'm loyal like it‚Äôs my job, but also really avoidant and will probably ghost you at LEAST once, especially when I have 34 people to dm (working hard to do better at this too). I don‚Äôt really know how to be anything but sincere, even when I‚Äôm anxious or avoidant or scared.

I enjoy hanging out with him and don‚Äôt want to cut him off if he just wants friendship‚Äî but I was also so heartbroken by him and am worried these ongoing interactions will just give me hope.

Hi, everyone from the channel. My name is Lu√≠s‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôd rather not reveal my full name. I‚Äôve been a subscriber for a while, and today I decided to share a story that still gives me chills every time I think about it. I‚Äôm a registered nurse now and currently work at a private hospital that‚Äôs part of a big network in my city. But back in 2014, I was just a nursing technician. I had just finished my vocational course, full of hope, resume in hand, walking all over town, dropping off paper wherever I could‚Äîclinics, private hospitals, tiny corner offices.

When I got a call for a temporary position at Santa Efig√™nia Public Hospital, I almost cried. It was an emergency contract, nothing solid, but with the night shift bonus, it was enough to pay rent on the small room I shared with a friend, buy food, and hold out until something better came along.

I started on a Monday in May. They put me on the 11 PM to 7 AM shift‚Äîthe dreaded overnight. I was what they called a support tech, the go-to guy for everything. I‚Äôd run from one floor to another with medications, adjust oxygen levels, help transfer patients, change IV bags, check vitals‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt stop. The hospital was old, built with 70s concrete, but it was still standing thanks to a handful of professionals who worked miracles with what little they had.

The first few nights were exhausting, but uneventful. Nights in a hospital are long. You start recognizing the sounds: the beeping of heart monitors, the echo of footsteps on cold tile floors, the muffled snores of patients in the hall. Sometimes the silence is so loud it feels like it‚Äôs screaming. And like every old building, Santa Efig√™nia had its creepy spots‚Äîcreaky doors, flickering lights, footsteps where no one‚Äôs walking. You just learn to ignore it. Comes with the job.

But since my first night, something bothered me: the annex.
Behind the main hospital, separated by a covered walkway, was a smaller building. A two-story annex that used to house the old men‚Äôs ward, some observation beds, and the old pharmacy. All of that is now on the hospital‚Äôs top floor. The annex had been shut down for about two years after a fire. No one went in there anymore. The gate was sealed with a thick chain and two heavy padlocks. The sign, already faded by rain and time, read: ‚ÄúANNEX ‚Äì CLOSED OFF.‚Äù

It was weird thinking that, in a public hospital where space is always tight, a whole wing had been abandoned for so long.
But even closed off, it never felt truly deactivated.
At night, especially after 3 AM, it was common to hear creaking noises from that side. The janitor said it was the concrete settling. But I‚Äôd passed by and heard something else: a bed being dragged, a nurse call bell going off‚Äîother sounds.

One night, as I walked in for another shift, I looked at the rusted iron door of the annex and got the strange feeling something was behind it. It gave me chills.
In the main ward, the system showed all beds‚Äîoccupied, free, being cleaned, etc.
And that night, at exactly 3:13 AM, a new admission popped up:

Jo√£o Elias de Almeida ‚Äì Bed 313.
But our hospital didn‚Äôt have a bed 313. The last one was 309.

I deleted the name. Thought it was a system glitch.
But the next night, same time, it came back.
I took out my phone, snapped a photo of the screen, and went straight to the night supervisor. She looked at it and took a deep breath.

‚ÄúJust let it go, Lu√≠s. It‚Äôs happened before.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already filed reports with I.T.‚Ä¶ they say it‚Äôs an old bug. A database issue. Sometimes it pulls data from wings that don‚Äôt exist anymore. Just an old echo in the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know who Jo√£o Elias de Almeida is?‚Äù I asked.

She looked at me. Took a while to answer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a public hospital, kid... what do you think?‚Äù

The third time it happened, the intercom rang. It was the front desk extension. But the screen said: EXTENSION 313.

I answered. Silence. Then‚Äîlabored breathing, like someone out of breath. I hung up immediately.

Next shift, while sipping weak coffee in the cafeteria, old Mr. Silvio‚Äîthe night security guard‚Äîstarted talking to me. He caught me staring at the hospital floor plan on the tiled wall.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre curious about the annex, huh?‚Äù he asked, straight to the point.

I nodded, a bit sheepishly. He sighed.

‚ÄúThat place caught fire one night two years ago. Started on the top floor, the men‚Äôs ward. They said it was an electrical short in one of the rooms, but no one really believes that. Two patients died. And the weird thing‚Ä¶ was the condition of the bodies.‚Äù

Silvio looked down, as if reliving the moment. Then continued:

‚ÄúI was here that night. One of the first on the scene when the alarm went off. The smell of smoke was intense. The fire had already taken most of the men‚Äôs ward. The extinguishers weren‚Äôt enough. Firefighters arrived quickly, managed to get almost everyone out. All but two patients.‚Äù

He paused, gripping his paper cup tightly.

‚ÄúWhen the firefighters found the bodies‚Ä¶ one of them was untouched. The bed was intact. No soot, no burns. Not even the sheet was scorched. But the smell‚Ä¶ it was like burnt death. Like the fire had happened inside him.‚Äù

I tried to laugh, call it an urban legend, but I choked when I heard the name of the dead: Jo√£o Elias de Almeida.

Silvio squinted, like he was watching the scene all over again. His cup trembled, spilling coffee over the sides. He didn‚Äôt even notice.

‚ÄúI saw him,‚Äù he whispered, like afraid someone else might hear. ‚ÄúNot back then. Months later. Maybe five months after the fire.‚Äù

I sat up straighter, trying to act skeptical. But my skin was crawling.

‚ÄúI was walking down the main hallway, coming back from X-ray. Another quiet night. Just the hum of the A/C. Then I saw someone walking slowly, his back to me. Wearing a hospital gown, thinning hair. Barefoot. Looked lost.‚Äù

Silvio looked sideways, like watching the hallway again.

‚ÄúI called out. ‚ÄòSir, are you okay?‚Äô Nothing. He just kept walking. But the way he moved... it was weird, like his feet touched the floor but didn‚Äôt really step. Like he was gliding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou followed him?‚Äù I asked.

He nodded.

‚ÄúWhen I turned the corner, he was gone. But the floor was stained. Like someone had just come from a coal furnace. Footprints. And they ended in the middle of the hallway. Just stopped. And that smell‚Äî‚Äù he wrinkled his nose, ‚Äúthe same as during the fire. Smoke and burnt flesh.‚Äù

I stayed quiet, a bitter taste rising in my throat. Silvio set his cup down, like he‚Äôd said what he needed to.

One time, I saw it with my own eyes.
It was a night like any other. The system beeped. ‚ÄúBED 313‚Äù lit up on the screen. And I decided to go to the annex.

I left my station, walked down the cold corridor. Outside, the sky was clear, no wind. But the hall to the annex felt freezing.
The gate was ajar. The chain on the floor. No padlock.
I pushed it open slowly. The building was fully lit inside. Like it was working. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The hallways were clean, like freshly mopped. The smell‚Ä¶ that old hospital smell.

The annex elevator was working. The panel lit up. I went up to the top floor.
The doors opened with a dry clack.

In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed with a sheet over it. I walked toward it. My whole body shook with each step.

On the ID tag, it read:
BED 313
The sheet moved. Like someone was breathing underneath it.

With a trembling hand, I pulled it off in one go.
No one there. But the mattress was sunken, like someone had been lying there.

Footprints on the floor led to the wall. And vanished.

I ran to the elevator. It wouldn‚Äôt move.
I was stuck there for almost ten minutes. The bed stood between me and the stairs. I didn‚Äôt dare cross.

When I finally made it down, I went straight to the main ward. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my badge, and quit right there, hands still shaking.
The supervisor didn‚Äôt even ask why. She just looked at me and nodded‚Äîlike she already knew.

In the following days, I tried to forget. Told myself it was exhaustion, lack of sleep, the pressure of night shifts. But something kept bothering me, nagging in the back of my mind: what really happened in that hospital all those years ago?

I did some digging on my own. Looked through public archives and found an old newspaper article.
The fire at the hospital killed two men.
One of them was Jo√£o Elias de Almeida.
The other‚Ä¶ was Silvio da Costa.

I just stared at the screen for a few minutes. Same face. Even the badge was visible, pinned to the burned uniform in the photo. Same security outfit. Same tired eyes.

I had spent months talking to a ghost.
A dead man.
A lingering echo of what remained in that old wing of the hospital.",3,1745287387.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

\- I'm a rock/heavy metal head... any good nigh bar of this style?

\- Any good/basic words/phrases to learn in Polish?  
\- Something I should consider, like places to avoid because insecurity or not tourist friendly if is the case?  (Probably I would end walking alone at night lol)  
\- Do I need something for public transport, or can I just pay in cash/debit card?

I'm going to be on the 1st of August, Warsaw Uprising, where should I definitely go on this day?  
Is there an oficial/safe site to buy the tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau?

Thanks, and see you soon Warsaw!!

Edit: Thanks for those who replied so far. Just to clarify, I'm aware Auschwitz-Birkenau is like 1 day trip and not close to Warsaw, still I'm planning on getting a tour there so any info about is appreciated. ",1,1745287261.0,warsaw,4,1.0,False

You start recognizing the sounds: the beeping of heart monitors, the echo of footsteps on cold tile floors, the muffled snores of patients in the hall. Sometimes the silence is so loud it feels like it‚Äôs screaming. And like every old building, Santa Efig√™nia had its creepy spots‚Äîcreaky doors, flickering lights, footsteps where no one‚Äôs walking. You just learn to ignore it. Comes with the job.

But since my first night, something bothered me: the annex.
Behind the main hospital, separated by a covered walkway, was a smaller building. A two-story annex that used to house the old men‚Äôs ward, some observation beds, and the old pharmacy. All of that is now on the hospital‚Äôs top floor. The annex had been shut down for about two years after a fire. No one went in there anymore. The gate was sealed with a thick chain and two heavy padlocks. The sign, already faded by rain and time, read: ‚ÄúANNEX ‚Äì CLOSED OFF.‚Äù

It was weird thinking that, in a public hospital where space is always tight, a whole wing had been abandoned for so long.
But even closed off, it never felt truly deactivated.
At night, especially after 3 AM, it was common to hear creaking noises from that side. The janitor said it was the concrete settling. But I‚Äôd passed by and heard something else: a bed being dragged, a nurse call bell going off‚Äîother sounds.

One night, as I walked in for another shift, I looked at the rusted iron door of the annex and got the strange feeling something was behind it. It gave me chills.
In the main ward, the system showed all beds‚Äîoccupied, free, being cleaned, etc.
And that night, at exactly 3:13 AM, a new admission popped up:

Jo√£o Elias de Almeida ‚Äì Bed 313.
But our hospital didn‚Äôt have a bed 313. The last one was 309.

I deleted the name. Thought it was a system glitch.
But the next night, same time, it came back.
I took out my phone, snapped a photo of the screen, and went straight to the night supervisor. She looked at it and took a deep breath.

‚ÄúJust let it go, Lu√≠s. It‚Äôs happened before.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already filed reports with I.T.‚Ä¶ they say it‚Äôs an old bug. A database issue. Sometimes it pulls data from wings that don‚Äôt exist anymore. Just an old echo in the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know who Jo√£o Elias de Almeida is?‚Äù I asked.

She looked at me. Took a while to answer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a public hospital, kid... what do you think?‚Äù

The third time it happened, the intercom rang. It was the front desk extension. But the screen said: EXTENSION 313.

I answered. Silence. Then‚Äîlabored breathing, like someone out of breath. I hung up immediately.

Next shift, while sipping weak coffee in the cafeteria, old Mr. Silvio‚Äîthe night security guard‚Äîstarted talking to me. He caught me staring at the hospital floor plan on the tiled wall.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre curious about the annex, huh?‚Äù he asked, straight to the point.

I nodded, a bit sheepishly. He sighed.

‚ÄúThat place caught fire one night two years ago. Started on the top floor, the men‚Äôs ward. They said it was an electrical short in one of the rooms, but no one really believes that. Two patients died. And the weird thing‚Ä¶ was the condition of the bodies.‚Äù

Silvio looked down, as if reliving the moment. Then continued:

‚ÄúI was here that night. One of the first on the scene when the alarm went off. The smell of smoke was intense. The fire had already taken most of the men‚Äôs ward. The extinguishers weren‚Äôt enough. Firefighters arrived quickly, managed to get almost everyone out. All but two patients.‚Äù

He paused, gripping his paper cup tightly.

‚ÄúWhen the firefighters found the bodies‚Ä¶ one of them was untouched. The bed was intact. No soot, no burns. Not even the sheet was scorched. But the smell‚Ä¶ it was like burnt death. Like the fire had happened inside him.‚Äù

I tried to laugh, call it an urban legend, but I choked when I heard the name of the dead: Jo√£o Elias de Almeida.

Silvio squinted, like he was watching the scene all over again. His cup trembled, spilling coffee over the sides. He didn‚Äôt even notice.

‚ÄúI saw him,‚Äù he whispered, like afraid someone else might hear. ‚ÄúNot back then. Months later. Maybe five months after the fire.‚Äù

I sat up straighter, trying to act skeptical. But my skin was crawling.

‚ÄúI was walking down the main hallway, coming back from X-ray. Another quiet night. Just the hum of the A/C. Then I saw someone walking slowly, his back to me. Wearing a hospital gown, thinning hair. Barefoot. Looked lost.‚Äù

Silvio looked sideways, like watching the hallway again.

‚ÄúI called out. ‚ÄòSir, are you okay?‚Äô Nothing. He just kept walking. But the way he moved... it was weird, like his feet touched the floor but didn‚Äôt really step. Like he was gliding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou followed him?‚Äù I asked.

He nodded.

‚ÄúWhen I turned the corner, he was gone. But the floor was stained. Like someone had just come from a coal furnace. Footprints. And they ended in the middle of the hallway. Just stopped. And that smell‚Äî‚Äù he wrinkled his nose, ‚Äúthe same as during the fire. Smoke and burnt flesh.‚Äù

I stayed quiet, a bitter taste rising in my throat. Silvio set his cup down, like he‚Äôd said what he needed to.

One time, I saw it with my own eyes.
It was a night like any other. The system beeped. ‚ÄúBED 313‚Äù lit up on the screen. And I decided to go to the annex.

I left my station, walked down the cold corridor. Outside, the sky was clear, no wind. But the hall to the annex felt freezing.
The gate was ajar. The chain on the floor. No padlock.
I pushed it open slowly. The building was fully lit inside. Like it was working. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The hallways were clean, like freshly mopped. The smell‚Ä¶ that old hospital smell.

The annex elevator was working. The panel lit up. I went up to the top floor.
The doors opened with a dry clack.

In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed with a sheet over it. I walked toward it. My whole body shook with each step.

On the ID tag, it read:
BED 313
The sheet moved. Like someone was breathing underneath it.

With a trembling hand, I pulled it off in one go.
No one there. But the mattress was sunken, like someone had been lying there.

Footprints on the floor led to the wall. And vanished.

I ran to the elevator. It wouldn‚Äôt move.
I was stuck there for almost ten minutes. The bed stood between me and the stairs. I didn‚Äôt dare cross.

When I finally made it down, I went straight to the main ward. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my badge, and quit right there, hands still shaking.
The supervisor didn‚Äôt even ask why. She just looked at me and nodded‚Äîlike she already knew.

In the following days, I tried to forget. Told myself it was exhaustion, lack of sleep, the pressure of night shifts. But something kept bothering me, nagging in the back of my mind: what really happened in that hospital all those years ago?

I did some digging on my own. Looked through public archives and found an old newspaper article.
The fire at the hospital killed two men.
One of them was Jo√£o Elias de Almeida.
The other‚Ä¶ was Silvio da Costa.

I just stared at the screen for a few minutes. Same face. Even the badge was visible, pinned to the burned uniform in the photo. Same security outfit. Same tired eyes.

I had spent months talking to a ghost.
A dead man.

Peeling Back the Truth of Chiquita Bananas

What could kill more people than the Revolutionary War, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the Genocide on Gaza, and the Chernobyl Disaster? A banana company. From the 19th century to the present day, United Fruit Company ‚Äìknown today as Chiquita Bananas‚Äì has reigned terror upon Latin America. Not-so-humbly beginning as a railroad monopoly in Costa Rica, the fruit hurricane continued its expansion into most of Latin America, ending up with political power, and worse, the motive to keep it. United Fruit Company mutated Latin America and its people through its unethical workplace conditions and treatment of unions, its coup of Guatemala and the subsequent Guatemalan Genocide, and its long-lasting environmental and economic impact.

How does one of Guatemala‚Äôs highest-paying jobs turn into a worker's worst nightmare? UFCo started as a new hope for many Latin Americans, being the highest-paying work of its kind. Soon, many of the workers realized the money might not be worth it. ‚ÄúUnited Fruit Company was known for its cruelty in the workplace and the racist social order they perpetuated ‚Ä¶ they continue many of the same practices of political and social manipulation as their parent company once did.‚Äù(Morey, 2014) UFCo‚Äôs management was nothing but wealthy Americans who sat around and did nothing besides mocking their workers. UFCo‚Äôs management was not the only thing that began to drive employees away. The ideal banana climate is hot, humid, and lower to sea level. This sent employees running toward the arid coffee plantations in the same area. Not only this, but this climate was an accelerator for malaria, contributing to the dwindling numbers of employees. The remaining ones were sick of the conditions and began to unionize and demand better treatment.¬†

When these unions arose, United Fruit Company responded with violence. The protests, gatherings, and demands became a personal attack on UFCo. Little did all of the protestors know, UFCo already had the territorial, political, and military advantage. This led to the events of December 5th, 1928.¬†

‚ÄúProtest started due to the indirect hiring of workers on the part of the company, which decreased costs greatly by not paying legal labour benefits by using sub-contractors‚Ä¶ This situation caused great losses to all economic sectors, especially to commerce. Almost $30.000 were the average daily loss suffered by the department, which means that on the average, the month-cost of the conflict reached $1.000.000‚Ä¶ Events reached their peak in Ci√©naga. The workers had concentrated for a pacific demonstration in the evening of the 5^(th) of December. The Governor Nu√±ez Roca decreed the dispersion of the demonstration. The workers did not receive this well; they declared that authorities had taken this decision with the support of the UFC and the militaries without the presence of workers' representatives‚Ä¶ The army gave the strikers 15 minutes to disperse and the workers' answer was the massive agitation of the Colombian flags and shouts related to the workers movement. The army responded with drumbeats and the menace to repel the strikers. Three bugle warnings were given, but nevertheless the strikers remained in their positions. A deep silence reigned in the square and the menace of the army became an unfortunate reality when the shout ""Shoot"" was uttered. Rifles and machine guns were discharged against the defenceless and unarmed demonstrators. In minutes the ground of the square was tinted with blood.‚Äù (Caro et al).

Death tolls for the massacre now referred to as the Banana Massacre range from 40 all the way to over 2000 deaths. This would not be the deadliest event involving UFCo. Instead, it set a trend of UFCo responding to any minor threat with full-scale attacks, and more importantly, convincing others to help them. UFCo finally felt its true power over the people of the countries it resided in.

UFCo had become a power-hungry machine, shutting down anything or anybody that dared to stand up against it. UFCo had acquired the not-so-loving nickname ‚ÄòEl Pulpo‚Äô (Spanish for ‚Äòthe octopus‚Äô) by locals for how it had its hand in everything in the region. During the height of the Cold War, Guatemala‚Äôs government began to impose restrictions on UFCo and attempted to lessen its political power. UFCo was not happy about this, and using the US‚Äô fear of communism, asked them for help with the ‚Äòcommunism‚Äô in Guatemala. Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, they launched what is now known as Operation ‚ÄúPBSuccess‚Äù. ‚ÄúOn June 27, 1954, democratically elected Guatemalan president Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n was deposed in a CIA-sponsored coup to protect the profits of the United Fruit Company. √Årbenz was replaced by decades of brutal U.S.-backed regimes who committed widespread torture and genocide.‚Äù (Gonzalez, 135). Backed by the CIA, UFCo decimated Guatemala‚Äôs governmental system in the span of just a few days. Of course, the new leader gave UFCo all of its land back, and did much, much worse.

The new authoritarian leader, Carlos Castilla Armas, along with the US and UFCo appointed militia caused a Civil War within Guatemala, and what is now known as the Silent Holocaust. Unreported, undocumented, and unpublicized, over 200,000 Maya Guatemalans were slaughtered. ‚ÄúCivil war existed in Guatemala since the early 1960s due to inequalities existing in the economic and political life. In the 1970s, the Maya began participating in protests against the repressive government, demanding greater equality and inclusion of the Mayan language and culture. In 1980, the Guatemalan army instituted ‚ÄúOperation Sophia,‚Äù which aimed at ending insurgent guerrilla warfare by destroying the civilian base in which they hid. This program specifically targeted the Mayan population, who were believed to be supporting the guerilla movement.‚Äù (Holocaust Museum Houston). While UFCo was not the one directly doing the killing, the blood rests on their hands. Their greed led to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives. In the present day, the Silent Holocaust is not taught, talked about, or showcased at all. The US, CIA, and all of those involved in the coup and Silent Holocaust (UFCo members included) were never tried for their crimes, with only the main ringleaders ever seeing justice.¬†

Man would not be the only thing to feel UFCo‚Äôs wrath. Earth suffered the consequences of a monopoly built on greed and suffering. The effects of the millions of acres occupied by UFCo‚Äôs plantations, which mowed down native trees and animals, and the use of pesticides are still being felt today. ‚ÄúBoth his work and leisure activities allude to some of the ways in which the ecological ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù of twentieth-century North American consumers extended beyond the nation's borders: not only did United Fruit clear forests, drain wetlands and expose tens of thousands of people to pesticides, but its middle-class North American employees introduced exotic species of fish into the ecosystem in their spare time.‚Äù (Soluri). Banana companies in general produce about 324 grams to 1,124 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of bananas (Carbon Footprint). 50 billion metric tons of bananas are produced in one year. The output of carbon is astonishing. The rainforests of Central America also faced near deforestation with the amount of trees mowed down in such a short period of time. The soil in some parts of Central America will take decades to be good for harvesting again due to the abuse it was put through.

UFCo was greedy in every sense of the word. Possibly, the only positive impact they had on the area they inhabited was economically. ‚ÄúWe started out thinking that the company had a detrimental effect, influenced not only by Gabriel G√°rc√≠a M√°rquez, but also the Costa Rican classic, *Mamita Yunai*.¬† We gradually began to find that areas under United Fruit‚Äôs influence were actually more prosperous. These initial findings were met with skepticism by the researchers, who suspected that the aggregated nature of their data might have skewed the results. In pursuit of more granular data, we obtained geo-referenced census block data, allowing for precise measurement at nearly the household level. Upon reanalysis, the results consistently showed that households within UFCo areas were indeed better off.‚Äù (Harvesting History). The income that UFCo made created better housing, income rates, and healthcare in the areas it worked. The GDP of all of the countries it used skyrocketed, and made them the flourishing economic landscapes they are today. Banana plantations still exist in much of Central America, and are still one of the best income generators in these countries.

United Fruit Company decimated Central America through its blatant disregard of workers' rights, the taking of and following the Guatemalan Coup/Genocide, and had a lasting impact on the modern-day environment and economy. Through their ruthless work policies and subsequent killings of protesters, UFCo began as a company not to be messed with. They furthered this with the overtaking of an entire country and genocide simply for capital gain. The environmental, economic, and physical landscape of Central America will never truly escape UFCo‚Äôs actions. Neither will the over 200,000 victims of the Silent Holocaust. Neither will the families that were displaced. Rebranded as Chiquita Bananas, the company makes $3.1 billion each year. This money perpetuates the cycle of using the countries the company has exploited for nearly a century unpunished. These bananas are grown with blood. These bananas are grown with years of suffering and the lives of innocents.

Tagline: I‚Äôll let you in, but I‚Äôm watching you.¬†

Starting Tone: demonic, taunting, gleefully mean

Setting; SFX: the woods during a night storm; wind rustling through the trees, birds cawing ominously, rain, and thunder.

Word Count: 2,735; \~26 - 28 minutes

\[We hear the sounds of the listener sprinting through the woods in fear: the wind rushing past the ears, rapid footsteps, branches snapping, etc.\]¬†



(*Distorted, ethereally phasing in and out, untethered to a physical body*) Not that way, little mouse.¬†



Not that way either\~



Now you‚Äôre going the opposite way. You‚Äôll never get back to your campsite at this rate. Why don‚Äôt you just stop running, take a rest, and sit? Just sit and stop all this hassle and let me catch you.¬†



\[You laugh.\]



What language! Aren‚Äôt you tired yet, mouse? Haven‚Äôt you run off all that energy and adrenaline yet?



(*Sharp*) As if I didn‚Äôt hear you the first time.



\[The running sounds stop, and we hear a *thunk* of the listener tripping.\]



(*Mocking*) You hurt my feelings, so I hurt you\~ Maybe now you‚Äôll watch your mouth‚Ä¶ Or maybe you‚Äôll let this game come to an end. That looks like it hurts. Can you walk anymore, let alone run, while bleeding like that?



\[The running continues, stilted and slower.\]¬†



(*Weirdly excited*) How persistent. How cute. How foolish. Do you think there‚Äôs any getting away from me, little mouse, now that I know the scent of your blood, now that the soil of my forest knows its taste? How do you think this is going to end? Where do you think you could go?¬†



Bold of you to assume I‚Äôm not already there, that I don‚Äôt hold dominion over hell as well. But fine, have it your way. Run around blindly in my little maze; you‚Äôll tire before daylight can save you.¬†



\[The sounds of the woods get louder, perhaps frighteningly loud, as the listener runs. This continues for a bit, long enough to denote hopelessness and panic, and then we hear the footsteps slow to a stop. Then we can hear vigorous knocking as the listener bangs on a door.\]



(*Muffled, angry*) I‚Äôm coming, I‚Äôm coming! Who the fuck is it?



\[The door is pulled open, and we hear the *click* of a gun hammer being cocked.\]



(*Unmuffled*) Do you know what fucking time it is?? How fucking crazy you sound, banging on doors and screaming about the dark? You‚Äôre lucky I didn‚Äôt shoot first, ask questions later.



I don‚Äôt have to do shit! Why the fuck would I let you into my home? What the fuck are you doing here, this far from the campground, this late? I don‚Äôt have any valuables here, and I‚Äôm obviously armed, so if you‚Äôre looking to rob me, you‚Äôre shit out of luck.¬†



\[You pause, considering them, before grunting.\]¬†



(*Reluctant*) If I let you in, it‚Äôs only till morning.¬†



You try anything, I shoot you.¬†



I‚Äôm going to check you for weapons and shoot you if I find any.¬†



\[Another pause, another grunt.\]



‚Ä¶Fine, come in. *Slowly*.



\[The door slams shut, and we don‚Äôt hear the outside anymore but the faint crackling of a fire.\]



(*Less angry, more taciturn*) I‚Äôm going to need to go spread your legs and hold out your arms. You‚Äôre not carrying anything?¬†



\[We hear some rustling and *thumps* of you searching the listener.\]¬†



Can‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôre hiding much in the ragged, torn up shit you‚Äôve got on. Where the fuck are your shoes? Your jacket?¬†



\[You sigh, almost reluctant, and we hear the *click* of releasing the gun hammer and maybe a *rustle* to indicate the gun being put away.\]¬†



Alright, you can put your hands down and relax. I don‚Äôt believe that the- the darkness and the night are haunting you or whatever, but I do believe you‚Äôre afraid of something out there. Did someone‚Ä¶ hurt you? The scrapes and cuts mostly look like you took a tumble in the brambles, but‚Ä¶



(*Concerned*) Okay‚Ä¶ Let me get a look at you. You don‚Äôt smell like booze, your pupils are normal. You don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre on anything.¬†



(*Sharp*) Well, sorry. When a bloodied, barefoot stranger shows up on my doorstep at fuck o‚Äôclock at night, talking about shadow people and monsters, it‚Äôs not unfair to assume they‚Äôre high out of their mind.¬†



\[You sigh again, taking a deep breath.\]¬†



Sorry‚Ä¶ Genuinely sorry. That wasn‚Äôt kind or necessary. You think something‚Äôs chasing you, and it‚Äôs not getting you in here, alright?



You said something about it‚Ä¶ them being the dark. I‚Äôve got plenty of light in here. Why don‚Äôt we move closer to the fire? You might feel safer there and better. You‚Äôre cold to the touch, so hypothermia might be a concern.



\[We hear footsteps and the sound of the fire gets louder as you usher the speaker towards the fire and move about, getting things.\]¬†



Take a seat; let me grab you a drink and the first aid kit.¬†



(*Muffled*) Have you eaten? Do you eat meat? I can make you a sandwich.¬†



(*Unmuffled*) I suppose that‚Äôs fair; it looks like you‚Äôve been through a lot. At some point tonight, I *will* need you to eat something though. I‚Äôm going to look at your injuries now.¬†¬†



Did that hurt?



What about this?¬†



Hm, I think your ankle might be twisted. You‚Äôll want to keep sitting, let the swelling come down, and then we can reevaluate tomorrow. Hydrating would help; you should drink your water.¬†



Is something wrong?¬†



(*Gentler*) Give it here.¬†



\[You take a big *gulp* of their water.\]¬†



Not drugged, not poisoned, nothing like that. Just tap water. When I get you more, I‚Äôll bring a pitcher, and I‚Äôll drink from that too.¬†



Good, thank you. While you do that, I‚Äôm going to disinfect these cuts on your legs and feet. I‚Äôd say you should let me know if it hurts, but I already know it‚Äôs going to, and you should too.¬†



No getting around it. I already think you‚Äôre hallucinating or having a psychotic break or something, and getting an infection won‚Äôt help.¬†



Talk me through it then. Tell me what happened.¬†



Really. Talking will keep your mind off the sting and pain, help you get your thoughts together. Where are you from? Are you camping in the area?¬†



(*Angry but like a concerned angry*) That site is almost five miles away. How long have you been running around in the dark?



Jesus. What compelled you to leave your phone, your tent, your flashlight, your *shoes*? What made you think that was a good idea?¬†



\[You pause and then laugh, startled and almost light, breaking the tension.\]



You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre right, that wasn‚Äôt fair of me. Sometimes you gotta piss in the middle of night, and you get turned around. That‚Äôs happened to me more than I‚Äôd like to admit, though I‚Äôve never ended up so far from my tent and so worse for the wear. What can you tell me about what got you so lost? I know you said it looked like ‚Äúthe darkness and the night‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt think you want me radio-ing the rangers in the morning and saying ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôve got someone here who says they were chased by Batman.‚Äù¬†



Sorry, that was a joke. I was trying to put you at ease. Even if I don‚Äôt agree you saw what you think you saw, it matters to me that you‚Äôre scared, and I‚Äôll make sure it doesn‚Äôt get you.¬†



Scout‚Äôs honor.¬†



For thirteen, illustrious years, and I‚Äôve got the badges somewhere around here to prove it. My first-aid skills might also speak for themselves. Can you flex your legs and feet for me?



How does that feel? Better?



Good, you‚Äôre starting to look better too. You‚Äôre still shaking though, so excuse me‚Ä¶¬†



\[We hear a *sssshf* of you taking a heavy blanket and putting it across the listener‚Äôs lap.\]



There, keeping warm will help your circulation, help the swelling go down, and keep the shock and hypothermia away. Do you want something hot to drink? I have tea, coffee‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd offer you a hot toddy if I didn‚Äôt think it might do more harm than good.¬†



Sure. Sure, I can just stay with you. We can stay up til dawn if that‚Äôs what you need to feel safe.¬†



(*Light*) Well, I‚Äôm sure as hell not going to sleep if you aren‚Äôt. You could still be trying to rob me for all I know, getting my guard down. If we‚Äôre both staying up, we might as well do it together, by the fire.¬†



\[We hear a rustling as you sit on the couch next to them, getting comfortable.\]



So what brings you out to these parts? I‚Äôm sorry, but this whole situation you‚Äôve found yourself in makes me think you don‚Äôt find yourself in the great outdoors often.¬†



\[You pause for a moment to judgmentally stare at the listener.\]



Mhm. New to the area?¬†



Yeah, I thought so. New to camping?¬†



Yeah, I gathered that.¬†



(*Approving*) Hmm, makes sense, and that‚Äôs good. Someone who didn‚Äôt have as much experience hiking would have frozen or fallen off a cliff or worse, so at least you have that going for you.¬†



As long as I can remember, in these very woods, as soon as I could walk. I took some of my first steps out that door, so yeah, I have some experience camping and hiking.¬†



(*Warm*) I love it- not just because I‚Äôve always lived here but because the forest is a good home. There‚Äôs nothing like trees and dew being all you smell when you open your window in the morning‚Ä¶ or when unzip your tent, for that matter.¬†



\[You laugh.\]



Yeah, I can understand why this might have given you a good impression, sure. There‚Äôs some scary things out there, but it‚Äôs nice. You get used to it, you learn to live with them.¬†



Sure, coyotes, bears, wolves, oh my. I‚Äôve been all over the place, in all their home turfs, and they become a lot less of a threat when you realize they don‚Äôt want to mess with people, that they‚Äôre probably more scared of you than you are of them.¬†



Maybe even what you heard, whatever that was. I mean, who‚Äôs not scared of a shivering, bedraggled camper in their pajamas? I‚Äôm shaking in my boots.¬†



Aw jeez, I was kidding, but you *are* shivering still. Do you want me to grab you some of my clothes? They won‚Äôt fit you properly, but they‚Äôll be dry and not torn to hell.¬†



Of course, I can stay here‚Ä¶¬†



\[You pause a moment and grunt.\]¬†



(*Gruff, almost bashful*) If you‚Äôre cold and you don‚Äôt want me to get you something dry to wear‚Ä¶¬†



\[You sigh.\]¬†



I feel obligated to offer sharing body heat.¬†



You don‚Äôt have to look so appalled. As cliche as it is, it‚Äôs a valid way to conserve warmth and calm down the nervous system. Being held makes people feel better.¬†



Obviously with your clothes on! I didn‚Äôt bring you inside and sit you by the fire just to creep on you and put you in a different danger.¬†



Scout‚Äôs honor.¬†



However you‚Äôre most comfortable.¬†



\[We hear some *rustling* as you move around on the couch.\]



Sitting next to you works better than nothing. Let me get this blanket around both of us‚Ä¶ and my arm around your back. There. Are you comfortable? Or at least, not freezing to death?¬†



Good. Other than that, you should take some deep breaths. You were real hopped up in adrenaline before; breathing deep and getting more oxygen into your system will help the come down.¬†



\[You chuckle.\]



(*Friendly, conversational*) Close, an EMT, a former one anyway. Not nearly as much schooling or training, but I‚Äôm good in a pinch.



On the job, no, I‚Äôve seen much weirder than this. Off the job‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve still seen weirder actually. You and your spontaneous sprint through the forest don‚Äôt even break the top three.¬†



Yeah, I thought it would.¬†



Now? Now I write. I write, I cook, I hike‚Ä¶ I occasionally open my door for strangers in the middle of the night. I keep busy.¬†



\[You chuckle.\]



I do. I do think I‚Äôm funny, and I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs nice to have another person around to appreciate it, even under these circumstances.¬†



(*Soft*) Not really‚Ä¶ only sometimes. I like being on my own; it‚Äôs peaceful. Plus, I don‚Äôt usually feel lonely out here, not with the trees, the animals. Mother Nature keeps me company, I guess you could say.¬†



(*Blunt, joking*) You‚Äôre forgiven.



\[You laugh warmly.\]



(*Almost sweet*) Kidding, obviously. You‚Äôre not intruding, and even if you were, I‚Äôm glad you darkened my doorstep instead of getting more lost out there.¬†



(*Agreeing*) But you‚Äôre not. Hell, you‚Äôre welcome to come back if you lay off the screaming and banging on my door‚Ä¶ and if you wear shoes next time. I mean it about the shoes. We have centipedes and ticks in these parts; you don‚Äôt wanna fuck with those.¬†



I‚Äôll slam the door in your face.¬†



Please do. Any‚Äôll do, though I‚Äôve gotta imagine you‚Äôve got hiking boots back at that tent of yours.¬†



Hopefully not. I promise these woods are usually‚Ä¶ well, I don‚Äôt want to say safe, because nature is going to do what nature does. But it‚Äôs beautiful around here and usually nice and quiet. I‚Äôll have to show you around sometime; you just need a good tour guide, that‚Äôs all.¬†



I‚Äôve been your personal host, nurse and heater, so might as well add ‚Äútour guide‚Äù to the list. I‚Äôd even be willing to add ‚Äúchef‚Äù onto there if you‚Äôre up to eat something.



(*Teasing*) If you think this is a date, you‚Äôve got more problems than your fucked up sense of direction and whatever‚Äôs out there.



\[You laugh.\]



(*Tentative, intimate as if snuggling closer*) No, when I take you out on a date, you‚Äôll know.¬†



Because I won‚Äôt just show you the forest; I‚Äôll take you to my favorite spot, my best kept secret.¬†

Mhmm. About a mile east of here, off the path, is this beautiful clearing, a little clear oasis hiding in the trees. There‚Äôs even a babbling brook; it could not *be* more picturesque and romantic. We could fish there, swim, bring a picnic‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the perfect place for stargazing.¬†



That‚Äôs the move; that‚Äôs the best way to really appreciate the forest, to be out there with nothing but yourself, the moon, the sky, the stars, and the quiet. If you lay back in the grass long enough, all the world falls away, and you can hear everything like the fish swimming, the trees breathing‚Ä¶ the smallest mouse lost in the grass.¬†



\[We hear a shuffling as the listener pulls away from you with a jerk.\]



(*Startled, confused*) Hey, hey! What‚Äôs wrong? I‚Äôm sorry, was that too much? I-¬†



The door is right over there; we would have heard if something came in. You‚Äôre safe now. Whatever was outside-¬†



What? What do you-



\[We hear the metallic sound of a gun being pulled out of its holster and the hammer being cocked.\]



(*On edge, measured*) Hey. Hey. I get that you‚Äôre going through something right now. I get that you‚Äôre scared, but you need to watch where you point that thing. Do you know how to use a handgun? You could hurt me; you could hurt yourself. Let‚Äôs be-



\[We hear the metallic sounds of the listener pulling the trigger and silence as the empty gun doesn‚Äôt fire. We pause for a beat for the listener to realize how fucked they are and for you to delight in it. You laugh, gleeful and slightly demented.\]



(*Taunting*) Performance issues; I‚Äôm told they‚Äôre quite common among your kind. I‚Äôd offer you another shot if bullets had any effect on me and not just the skin costume I‚Äôve borrowed.¬†



Oh yes, there‚Äôs a very real, very dead EMT in the master bedroom. That‚Äôs their gun you just stole, which is poor guest etiquette I might add.¬†



\[We hear the clatter of the listener dropping the gun and the rustle of them slowly getting up off the couch and backing away from you.\]¬†



What a silly question, how did I get here. I was always here. Before this house, before these trees, before the magma beneath our feet, I was here. I laid claim to this place and all within its bounds‚Ä¶ and that includes you, little mouse.



\[We hear footsteps as the listener starts to run, and you laugh, evilly.\]



(*As if playing a game of tag*) Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Ready or not, here I come.¬†

How the ""Fix My Marriage System"" Can Restore Connection and Communication
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Marriage often goes through ups and downs, and when challenges grow, couples may feel distant or misunderstood. The ""Fix My Marriage System"" offers a powerful, structured approach to help partners rebuild their connection and improve communication. Unlike quick fixes or vague advice, this system uses proven techniques designed to create real, lasting change in relationships.

At its core, the system focuses on restoring understanding between partners. When communication breaks down, couples can feel trapped in cycles of argument or silence. This system introduces simple yet effective communication tools that encourage honest sharing without blame or criticism. By creating a safe environment to express feelings and hear each other‚Äôs perspective, partners begin to reconnect on a deeper emotional level.

### Key Features That Renew Emotional Bonds

The system works through several stages to help couples rediscover their bond:

- **Active Listening Exercises:** These practices encourage couples to truly listen and validate each other's feelings. This reduces misunderstandings and builds empathy.
- **Daily Connection Rituals:** Small routines like sharing gratitude or spending focused time together can restore emotional intimacy, often lost amid busy schedules and stress.
- **Conflict Resolution Strategies:** Couples learn techniques for addressing disagreements calmly, avoiding blame, and finding solutions together.
- **Rebuilding Trust Actions:** Trust is foundational in marriage. The system guides couples through exercises that promote transparency and accountability.
 
These features are designed not just for immediate relief but to create sustainable improvements. When couples consistently apply these principles, they often notice an increase in emotional closeness and a decrease in conflict frequency.

### Improving Communication Through Structure and Support

One of the biggest hurdles in troubled marriages is a lack of effective communication. Sometimes, couples feel stuck because they don‚Äôt know how to talk through their issues without escalating tension. The ""Fix My Marriage System"" provides a clear framework for communication that keeps discussions productive and respectful.

The system often includes guided conversations, where partners are encouraged to take turns talking and listening. This method helps slow down the conversation, allowing both people to really absorb what is being said. It also minimizes interruptions and defensiveness, which are common roadblocks.

Additionally, the program typically offers worksheets or prompts that help couples explore what really matters to them beneath the surface of everyday disagreements. This reflective process uncovers underlying needs and desires, promoting better understanding.

### Why Consistency Makes a Difference

One of the strengths of this system is encouraging regular practice of its strategies. Transformation doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but by committing to daily or weekly exercises, couples gradually rewire their interaction patterns.

Consistency helps build new habits centered on kindness, patience, and openness. Over time, these habits become the default way partners relate to each other. This process not only heals past wounds but also strengthens the marriage against future challenges.

### A Personalized Approach Tailored to Your Relationship

Every marriage is unique, so the ""Fix My Marriage System"" often allows for customization based on your specific needs and issues. Whether you struggle with communication, trust, emotional intimacy, or all of these areas, the system can adapt its tools to fit your situation.

Because it empowers couples to take ownership of their relationship restoration, this approach can be more effective and long-lasting than one-size-fits-all solutions. You learn practical skills to maintain a healthy relationship even after using the program.

### Steps to Get Started and Keep Moving Forward

If you‚Äôre eager to restore the connection and communication within your marriage, consider these initial steps:

- Commit to working on the relationship together, with both partners actively involved.
- Set aside regular time, free from distractions, to practice the system‚Äôs exercises.
- Be patient and gentle with each other, recognizing that change takes time.
- Use the system‚Äôs tools consistently to shift negative patterns into positive ones.
- Celebrate small victories to build momentum and motivation.
 
By embracing this structured yet flexible system, you can transform your marriage from a place of frustration or distance into a source of love, respect, and ongoing joy. The key is a willingness to communicate openly and consistently rebuild your connection step by step.

If you‚Äôre ready to take action and bring positive change to your marriage, the ‚ÄúFix My Marriage System‚Äù offers a hopeful and practical path forward. Repairing your relationship is possible when both partners are equipped with the right tools and are committed to growing together.

</div>Practical Steps to Strengthen Your Relationship Beyond Quick Fixes
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Building Lasting Connections Through Intentional Actions

When faced with challenges in a marriage, it‚Äôs tempting to look for quick fixes that promise immediate relief. However, true strength in a relationship comes from consistent, thoughtful effort rather than momentary solutions. Focusing on practical steps that foster trust, communication, and empathy can create a solid foundation that lasts a lifetime.

### Open Communication: The Heartbeat of Healthy Relationships

Communication goes beyond just talking. It means actively listening and understanding your partner‚Äôs feelings without rushing to judgment or solutions. When you create safe spaces to share concerns honestly, you build emotional intimacy and respect. Here are some key practices to improve communication:

- **Practice active listening:** Give your full attention when your partner speaks. Nodding, maintaining eye contact, and reflecting back what you heard validates their perspective.
- **Avoid blame and criticism:** Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to express how you feel rather than condemning your partner‚Äôs actions. For example, say ‚ÄúI feel hurt when‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou always‚Ä¶‚Äù
- **Schedule regular check-ins:** Set aside time weekly to discuss feelings and any concerns. This keeps small problems from turning into bigger conflicts.

### Rekindling Emotional and Physical Connection

Over time, many couples drift apart because they focus too much on routine and external stresses. Rekindling the emotional and physical bond is essential for deepening love and satisfaction. Try incorporating small but meaningful gestures into your daily routine:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- **Express gratitude daily:** Saying ""thank you"" for even small acts fosters appreciation and positive feelings.
- **Engage in shared hobbies:** Find activities you both enjoy, whether it‚Äôs cooking, hiking, or a creative project that encourages teamwork and fun.
- **Prioritize physical touch:** Hugs, holding hands, or a gentle touch can release oxytocin, helping you both feel more connected and secure.

### Addressing Conflict as an Opportunity for Growth

Conflict is inevitable in any relationship, but how you handle disagreements can either strengthen or weaken your bond. Viewing conflict as a chance to learn about each other and grow together shifts your mindset from adversaries to partners solving problems. Consider these strategies:

- **Stay calm and take breaks:** If emotions run high, pause and come back to the conversation once both parties are calmer.
- **Focus on the issue, not the person:** Attack the problem, not your partner‚Äôs character.
- **Seek compromises:** Aim for solutions that respect both partner‚Äôs needs rather than winning the argument.

### Investing Time and Effort Deliberately

Consistency is more powerful than grand gestures. Setting aside quality time regularly can nurture your relationship in lasting ways. This means more than just being physically present‚Äîit involves meaningful engagement. Some suggestions include:

- **Plan regular date nights:** Make time for experiences outside of your routine to reconnect emotionally.
- **Create rituals or traditions:** Whether it‚Äôs a weekend walk or a morning coffee date, rituals help reinforce your bond.
- **Support each other‚Äôs goals:** Encourage personal growth and celebrate achievements together.

### Seeking Help When Needed Demonstrates Strength

Sometimes, the issues in a marriage benefit from outside support. Seeking counseling or attending workshops can provide tools that you might not discover on your own. It‚Äôs important to view professional help as a proactive, positive step‚Äînot a sign of failure. Many couples find that guided conversations help them unlock communication blocks and understand deeper emotional needs.

### Long-Term Commitment to Growth

Fixing a marriage isn‚Äôt a one-time event; it‚Äôs an ongoing journey. Couples who prioritize nurturing their relationship through practical, everyday actions tend to build happier, more resilient partnerships. By focusing on understanding, empathy, and shared goals, you create a marriage that thrives through life‚Äôs ups and downs. Remember, the most meaningful changes happen when you commit to a system of care, respect, and love every day.

Parody of Gloria Gaynor‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Will Survive‚Äù
By Absolutely Nobody In Particular

[Verse 1]
At first I was afraid, I was mortified
DRP‚Äôs a maze and half the rules ain‚Äôt clarified
I spent so many nights just refreshing Teams and threads
Now I know‚Ä¶ the guidance lives on Reddit instead

And so I‚Äôm here‚Äîno clear plan in sight
Just waiting on an ‚Äúassignment‚Äù while my badge still shows me white
They said, ‚ÄúReturn to office!‚Äù Fine‚Äî
But every meeting room‚Äôs a cubicle line
And bandwidth‚Äôs tight so shut your cam‚Äîmakes perfect sense, right?

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I scroll‚Äîthrough ‚ÄúTips & Tricks‚Äù with glee
‚ÄúStay off news and social sites‚Äù‚Äîexcept where leadership tweets policy
Doug‚Äôs on X, Musk boosts the thread
But I get flagged for what I read?
Oh no, not I‚Äîwe know how to tread

[Chorus]
We will survive!
We‚Äôll keep Teams chats alive while we watch our roles die
We‚Äôve got DRP to weigh, but the leave won‚Äôt start for days
So we survive‚Äîwe will survive‚Äîhey hey

[Verse 2]
Takes all the strength I‚Äôve got not to scream aloud
When Braverman says Reddit‚Äôs false‚Äîbut it‚Äôs better than the crowd
There‚Äôs a rumor flyin‚Äô loose, that they're tracking IP logs
To catch us workin' from home in fuzzy socks and hooded togs

But we keep rollin'‚ÄîNTEs unite!
The first to face the RIF but still we‚Äôre showing up to fight
PIs can't run their trials
Without our docs and grant denials
But we‚Äôre still ‚Äúnot essential‚Äù in these budget-bending files

[Pre-Chorus]
So now we mock‚Äîin snark and DMs sly
We‚Äôve got RTO but no chairs and a printer that just won‚Äôt comply
We apply by April‚Äôs end
To maybe RIF-dodging suspend
And maybe get paid through September, amen

[Chorus]
We will survive!
With our coffee and our memes and morale barely alive
We‚Äôve got dashboards to review, even if the funds fell through
We will survive‚Äîwe will survive!

[Bridge/Breakdown]
Cubicles replaced our space
And strategy‚Äôs lost without a trace
‚ÄúHold the line,‚Äù they say with pride
But folks are leaving nationwide...

Some have options, some have kids
Some are hanging on by bids
Some are tired, some stay loud‚Äî
But all of us? We make it proud

[Final Chorus]
We will survive!
Even when the outlook's bleak, we won‚Äôt say goodbye
They can freeze us out today, but we‚Äôll still find a way
We will survive‚Äîwe will survive!",8,1745286419.0,VHA_Human_Resources,0,0.83,False

# Who Is Yevgeniya (Gigi) Davarashvili & What‚Äôs the Hype?

If you‚Äôve been scouring the internet for *the* course to kick off your freelance design career, you‚Äôve probably stumbled upon the **‚ÄúYevgeniya (Gigi) Davarashvili - Flux Academy - Design Career Kickstarter Bundle.‚Äù** And for good reason. Gigi isn‚Äôt just a talented designer ‚Äì she‚Äôs a strategist, educator, and all-around badass who knows how to make design *sell*. Based in Switzerland, she ditched the corporate world (Marketing Director in London, no less) to go freelance back in 2016. Now she‚Äôs teaching creatives how to do the same ‚Äì with way less trial and error.

# What‚Äôs Inside the Design Career Kickstarter Bundle?

Let‚Äôs break it down: this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwatch a bunch of videos and hope for the best‚Äù kind of deal. The course, officially called **Freelance Ignite**, is packed with action steps, templates, scripts, and Gigi‚Äôs no-fluff coaching. Over 4 weeks, she walks you through building your foundation, finding clients (without relying on Upwork), mastering outreach, selling your services without awkwardness, and turning one-off projects into consistent income.

You‚Äôre not just learning *what* to do. You‚Äôre handed the actual tools ‚Äî email templates, outreach scripts, client contracts, and proposals that Gigi *actually uses*. Huge time saver.

# When & Where Should You Start?

Right now. Seriously. If you‚Äôre still waiting for the ‚Äúperfect moment‚Äù to begin freelancing, spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not coming. This course is for designers at the *very beginning* of their freelance journey ‚Äî especially if you have no paying clients yet. Everything is delivered online, so you can start from anywhere, whether you‚Äôre in your pajamas in a coffee shop or on your lunch break at your day job.

# Why This Bundle Is Different (And Actually Works)

Most freelance advice online is vague or outdated. But **Yevgeniya (Gigi) Davarashvili - Flux Academy - Design Career Kickstarter Bundle** feels different because it‚Äôs *real-world tested*. Gigi isn‚Äôt preaching from a pedestal ‚Äî she‚Äôs lived this journey. Plus, her teaching style is friendly, clear, and honestly, kinda fun.

What sets this course apart is how *practical* it is. Week by week, you‚Äôre guided through client outreach, pricing, branding, and mindset shifts that actually matter. Gigi even teaches a clever ‚Äúghost page‚Äù strategy and how to use Google Maps and Loom to get new clients. Smart, right?

# Who‚Äôs It For?

This course is *perfect* for you if:

* You‚Äôre lost on how to get your first client.
* You hate selling yourself (but want to get better at it).
* You want to freelance *before* quitting your job.
* You have skills, but no clue how to package them or price them.

Even if you‚Äôve done a few gigs here and there, you‚Äôll probably still find gold here ‚Äî especially if you want to level up and start earning more consistently.

# How Will It Help You Grow?

You‚Äôll walk away with more than just knowledge ‚Äî you‚Äôll have a *plan.* You‚Äôll know where to find clients, how to message them, how to close the deal, and how to deliver like a pro. Most importantly, you‚Äôll feel confident in your value as a designer. That mindset shift alone is worth the price.

**Final Thoughts:**  
The **‚ÄúYevgeniya (Gigi) Davarashvili - Flux Academy - Design Career Kickstarter Bundle‚Äù** isn‚Äôt just another course. It‚Äôs like a freelance design bootcamp that helps you cut months off your learning curve. Whether you‚Äôre a total newbie or feeling stuck in your freelance grind, this could be the rocket fuel your career needs.",1,1745286307.0,SdorLearning,1,1.0,False
1k4upd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1k4upd6/my_journey_with_this_disease/,My journey with this disease,"I have had LPR for 30 years. I‚Äôve seen GI docs, surgeons, specialists, shrinks‚Ä¶. you name it. 9 EGDS (one last week), 7 manometries, multiple upper endoscopies, barium swallow with and without contrast, esophageal pH monitoring, impedance pH monitoring, upper GIs, allergy tests and specialized esophageal manometry. I‚Äôve even had an mri of my stomach. Some say the surgery will help me, some say it won‚Äôt.

I have moderate dysphasia so I‚Äôm off of surgery for now but not ruling it completely out. There are two medications currently showing signs of strengthening the LES but waiting on the FDA for approval. You can Google it. One is an HIV drug. I‚Äôm hoping I can hold out.

Things that have really helped my symptoms:

Seeing a dietitian. She was a game changer. We all know to eat small meals and slow down but she said smaller meals every 1.5 hours. When I stick to it, it works. Don‚Äôt let the stomach get empty. Make it work.

Cut out the biggies COMPLETELY! Alcohol, garlic, tomato, chocolate, citrus, onions‚Ä¶ and keep a journal. Not everyone is the same. Bananas wreck me.

Don‚Äôt eat 3-4 hours before bed. It takes that long to digest. However, according to my dietitian, who was correct, an empty stomach is just as bad. Acid build up relaxes the LES.

For me, sleeping on my left side helps WAY more than a wedge or elevated bed. I bought a double wedged pillow for side sleepers. It was a game changer. Sleeping on your left side keeps the LES below the esophagus. Again, not everyone is the same but it‚Äôs science.

Follow Dr Molloy Pelletier on YouTube. She‚Äôs not only very informative but it‚Äôs cathartic too. Helps me not feel alone and she turned me on to Reflux Raft and Refux Gourmet. I do better on Gourmet.

Cut out or cut way down on sugar. Sugar attaches to the esophagus and can cause some fungal growth. It‚Äôs happened to me a couple times. Plus it‚Äôs just bad for Gerd.

I take DGL, L-Theanine, papaya and gasx. Not going to swear by them but my symptoms have been decreased by 75%.

I‚Äôm on omeprazole but again, to each their own.

Chamomile tea helps me but ginger tea wrecks me. Try to figure out which one helps. But no green tea or coffee.

Probiotics, vitamin B12 and D.

The most difficult thing by FAR is stress and anxiety. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. This is the one thing I have not mastered. I feel it‚Äôs the last thing for me to beat this. I‚Äôve tried every single anti anxiety med over 20 years with no luck. Exercise, diaphragm breathing and mindfulness do help but not a cure for me. Seeing my 5th psychiatrist.

I‚Äôm in and out in 9.5 ph water. Not sure if it helps or hurts.

Rinse your mouth out every morning and clean your tongue. Then drink warm water to wash down the acid.

Only drink water but not with meals. It fills your stomach. Stay hydrated. NO DAIRY

If you have IBS I strongly suggest a low fodmap diet. It cured my Ibs. Chronic IBS causes bile reflux which essentially is the same as acid reflux.

Buy small spray bottles on Amazon and fill with water and baking soda. Spray in mouth and nostrils. Helps with larynx, nose and throat. Trust me. 

Gaviscon, tums, aloe Vera‚Ä¶. does help but don‚Äôt over do it 

My worst trigger is over eating. It‚Äôs taken me 15 years to finally manage this. I still slip up and suffer but don‚Äôt over eat!

Living with Gerd/LPR sucks, no other way to put it. Listen to your doctor AND do your own research. The surgery is nothing to take lightly but some people have no choice and have no regrets.

Hope my long post helps.

PS: Get a good GI doc and stick with them. Try not to freak out about cancer like I do. The statistics are low. Pray and breathe through it.

PPS: change your mind set. Instead of focusing on what you CANT do, focus on what you CAN do. I used to love to go out and eat and drink but became a hermit for 5 years. Going out is not as fun for me now, but I‚Äôm forcing it. Yes it sucks to watch people eat burgers and drink beer but I bring snacks and drink water. I listen to the bands and force myself to laugh. It‚Äôs better than staying home and feeling sorry for myself. ",8,1745286278.0,LPR,2,1.0,False

I had set it up in July - had a side ‚Äúfull‚Äù so started working on the other side. Unfortunately my mom got really sick a couple weeks later and I was traveling out of state to take care of and kind of left it. By the time she passed away we were well into fall and I‚Äôm in zone 5a. So I just went out and started turning again. It‚Äôs got a lot of clumps (which I read how to fix).  I went in and added some banana peels and coffee grounds to each side. I added some paper to the newest side. I also took a few clumps and they‚Äôre not overly wet but it feels like mud cakes. I made the mistake of adding more water though. So now I‚Äôm confused on how to fix and here are my questions:
1 - should I marry the two sides so I can start a new side?
2 - is there anything I can put in to start heating it up?
3 - should I empty it into a bucket find a few earthworms to add in and let them do the rest of the work?
4 - I saw someone mention opening the lid and letting it dry it out a bit - but it‚Äôs still spring here. 

I was hoping to use it with some of my spring plantings.  Any help and ideas you can give would be greatly appreciated.",0,1745286193.0,composting,0,0.5,False

I really thought today would be my last day. I stayed up all night giving myself the perfect ending by watching films I‚Äôve wanted to watch, and my favorite ones too, I was weirdly calm, I kept telling myself I would die this day and it‚Äôs time to off myself. I felt so ready and prepared. When it became the afternoon I went out and enjoyed my ‚Äúlast‚Äù day on earth. I tried coffee for the first time, unfortunately didn‚Äôt like it, went to the park to admire the view one last time, allowed myself to have some ice cream, listening to my favorite music, I was doing what I wanted for the last time. When I was ready I walked up the stairs of the garage park, went to the edge of the five story garage park, I had planned this for about a week. I looked around my city one last time and looked down at my death.

 I was so ready, prepared myself the whole day, but my body just wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. I tried to jump, nothing, I even got a running but stopped  myself. I was gonna try again and keep on trying without coming back down until the worker of the parking garage came up and said people aren‚Äôt allowed up here which I wasn‚Äôt aware of, so I ended up going down without killing myself, wouldn‚Äôt even consider that shit an attempt if I never actually jumped, I felt so embarrassed and cowardly I couldn‚Äôt pull through. I decided if I can‚Äôt kill myself today I‚Äôll just buy some numbing cream so I can cut myself deeper with less pain. I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, I‚Äôve been struggling with no apparent cause. I had told myself everyone I knew would be fine without me and move on eventually. I struggle with body image and insecurities and my mind is just always negative, I can‚Äôt even stare at my reflection for long periods of time anymore.

My main symptoms are acne, excess hair and irregular/missing periods. I see an acupuncturist once a week, drink spearmint tea daily, bumped up my protein intake, tried inositol for 8 months+, cut out dairy, switched from coffee to matcha and while my acne has gotten a little better I still can't manage to get my period back. 

Throughout this journey I also developed anxiety & panic attacks. I think it stemmed from not being in control of my own body and general health anxiety -- specifically related to blood sugar/passing out. I started lexapro which helped my panic attacks a lot, but the few times I get them now I'm still not sure if it's a panic attack or low blood sugar. I get so stressed about it that I've stopped socially drinking on the weekends because they seem to happen more/get worse after a night of going out (I'm in my mid twenties so that makes me sad). I've been to multiple gynos and an endocrinologist and they all offer me birth control which I dont want to take, but I finally agreed to getting a prescription for metformin. I'm still not fully convinced if it's something I want to try especially because I'm afraid it will feed into my anxiety more by possibly lowering my blood sugar + the rare interaction it has with alcohol freaks me outtt.

### Understanding Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Benefits

Adaptogenic mushrooms have been prized for centuries for their ability to help the body manage stress, boost immunity, and improve overall well-being. Unlike regular mushrooms, adaptogens work by supporting the body's natural balance and resilience against physical and mental stressors. Popular varieties like reishi, chaga, lion‚Äôs mane, and cordyceps each offer unique benefits that can enhance cognitive function, increase energy levels, and promote restful sleep.

These natural powerhouses into your daily routine is a fantastic way to elevate your health in a holistic manner. However, to truly experience their benefits, consistency and thoughtful integration into your daily habits are key.

### Start Your Day with a Mindful Mushroom Ritual

The morning sets the tone for the entire day. By including adaptogenic mushrooms in your early routine, you can support focus and calmness, which helps you tackle daily demands with a clearer mind.

- **Mushroom Tea or Coffee:** Begin with a warm cup infused with powdered adaptogenic mushrooms. Lion‚Äôs mane and cordyceps work especially well in coffee, offering a natural energy boost without jitters.
- **Simple Supplements:** For convenience, capsules or tinctures can be taken with your breakfast. Take time to breathe deeply and set your intentions while you consume your mushroom-based supplement.

Integrate this step into your morning ritual to foster a sense of calm and alertness that can last throughout your day.

### Midday Enhancements to Sustain Energy and Focus

The afternoon slump is no match for adaptogenic mushrooms. They can help maintain balanced energy and reduce mental fatigue when work or life demands are high.

- **Power Snack:** Add a powdered adaptogenic mushroom blend like reishi and chaga to your midday smoothie or juice. This is a natural way to nourish your body while supporting your immune system.
- **Mindful Break:** Take a brief pause to sip on mushroom tea. Use this moment to practice breathing exercises or meditate for a few minutes, enhancing the adaptogen‚Äôs calming effects.

These small, intentional pauses enriched with adaptogens can significantly improve your afternoon productivity and emotional resilience.

### Evening Rituals to Support Relaxation and Recovery

As the day winds down, your body needs to shift gears toward rest and recovery. Adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi provide relaxing, restorative properties promoting better sleep and reduced anxiety.

- **Nighttime Beverage:** Prepare a warm cup of reishi tea before bed. This not only helps you unwind but may support your body‚Äôs ability to repair and rejuvenate overnight.
- **Incorporate into Meals:** Try cooking soups or stews with dried chaga or other adaptogenic mushrooms. The natural compounds work gently to balance hormones and reduce inflammation.

Including these habits fosters a peaceful environment for your body to heal and prepare for the next day.

### Tips for Seamlessly Adding Adaptogenic Mushrooms to Your Daily Life

Consistent use is how adaptogenic mushrooms unlock their full potential. Here are simple strategies that make inclusions easy and effective:

- **Choose Quality Products:** Opt for reputable brands that use organic, sustainably harvested mushrooms. This ensures potency and safety.
- **Start Small:** Begin with lower doses to observe how your body responds. Gradually increase to your desired dose without rushing.
- **Create Habit Triggers:** Pair your mushroom intake with existing routines like brushing teeth or meal times to build a natural habit loop.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Adaptogens support balance differently for everyone. Adjust timing and type of mushroom based on your energy patterns and needs.

By planning your daily routine with intention and care, integrating adaptogenic mushrooms becomes a natural extension of your lifestyle rather than an added chore.

### Maximizing Benefits with Lifestyle Choices

While adaptogenic mushrooms provide powerful support, their effects are amplified when paired with healthy lifestyle practices. Maintaining balanced nutrition, staying hydrated, and getting regular physical activity complement the mushrooms‚Äô adaptive qualities. Managing stress through mindfulness, journaling, or gentle yoga further enhances your overall well-being.

When you commit to a holistic approach, adaptogenic mushrooms serve as foundational allies in building resilience and enhancing vitality day by day.

The Science Behind Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Role in Stress Management
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Adaptogenic mushrooms have gained significant attention for their natural ability to help the body handle stress and promote overall well-being. These unique fungi are more than just a health trend; they are backed by scientific studies highlighting their role in stress management and resilience enhancement.

### What Makes Adaptogenic Mushrooms Unique?

Adaptogens are substances that support the body's ability to adapt to physical, emotional, and environmental stressors. Adaptogenic mushrooms belong to this group because they contain bioactive compounds that modulate the stress response system. Unlike stimulants, which provide a temporary energy boost, adaptogenic mushrooms work more subtly by balancing bodily systems to reduce stress impacts without causing jitters or crashes.

### Key Mushrooms Known for Stress Relief

Several types of mushrooms have been extensively studied for their adaptogenic properties:

- **Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum):** Known as the ""mushroom of immortality,"" Reishi has long been used in traditional medicine for its calming effects and ability to promote restful sleep, which is crucial for managing stress.
- **Ashwagandha-in-Mushroom Form:** While Ashwagandha is a herb, some mushroom blends integrate similar stress-relieving compounds, influencing cortisol levels.
- **Chaga (Inonotus obliquus):** Rich in antioxidants, Chaga helps reduce inflammation and oxidative stress‚Äîa common trigger for chronic stress issues.
- **Cordyceps (Cordyceps militaris):** Often used to enhance stamina and energy, Cordyceps helps combat fatigue linked to prolonged stress.
- **Lion‚Äôs Mane (Hericium erinaceus):** Beyond stress relief, Lion‚Äôs Mane promotes cognitive function and mental clarity, helping you stay sharp even during stressful periods.
 
### How Adaptogenic Mushrooms Work on Stress Hormones

One of the primary ways adaptogenic mushrooms manage stress is through influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This system regulates the body's hormonal response to stress, particularly the release of cortisol, the main stress hormone. High cortisol levels over time can lead to a range of health problems, including anxiety, insomnia, and weakened immunity.

Studies demonstrate that compounds in these mushrooms can help normalize cortisol secretion, preventing excessive spikes and promoting a balanced response to stress. This modulation helps maintain energy levels and mood, even when life‚Äôs challenges become overwhelming.

### Bioactive Compounds Behind the Benefits

The effectiveness of adaptogenic mushrooms is due to their rich content of polysaccharides, triterpenoids, and antioxidants. These components work together to:

- Reduce inflammation in the body, which often increases during stress.
- Support immune function, protecting the body from stress-induced illness.
- Protect brain cells from damage, promoting mental resilience.
- Enhance energy production at the cellular level, combating fatigue.
 
### Scientific Research Supporting the Use of Adaptogenic Mushrooms

Multiple scientific studies have revealed promising results regarding the stress-relieving properties of these mushrooms:

- A clinical trial showed that participants taking Reishi mushroom extract experienced reduced anxiety and improvements in sleep quality.
- Research on Lion‚Äôs Mane suggests it stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF), which supports brain regeneration and cognitive function under stress.
- Studies on Cordyceps report increased stamina and reduced fatigue markers, which can support recovery during stressful periods.
 
While more extensive human trials are needed to fully confirm these benefits, the existing evidence paints a compelling picture of adaptogenic mushrooms as powerful allies in natural stress management.

### Adaptogenic Mushrooms into Your Wellness Routine

To leverage the stress-busting benefits of these mushrooms, you can include them in various ways:

- **Powdered extracts:** Mix mushroom powders into smoothies, teas, or coffee for an easy daily boost.
- **Capsules or tablets:** These are convenient for consistent dosing and are often standardized for active compounds.
- **Functional mushroom beverages:** Ready-to-drink drinks with adaptogens are becoming popular for on-the-go stress support.
 
Starting with a low dose and gradually increasing ensures better tolerance and allows you to experience their subtle but lasting effects on stress reduction.

### Considerations and Safety

Adaptogenic mushrooms are generally safe for most people, but it‚Äôs wise to consult with a healthcare provider, especially if you‚Äôre pregnant, nursing, or have underlying health conditions. Quality matters, so choose reputable sources that test for purity and contaminants.

When used consistently, adaptogenic mushrooms can effectively complement lifestyle changes such as mindfulness, exercise, and balanced nutrition to build a robust defense against chronic stress.

</div>### Conclusion

Creating a daily routine that includes adaptogenic mushrooms offers a powerful way to support your overall well-being and manage stress more effectively. These natural fungi have been celebrated for their ability to help the body adapt to physical and emotional challenges, fostering balance and resilience. By thoughtfully integrating them into your daily habits‚Äîwhether through morning teas, smoothies, or supplements‚Äîyou give yourself a consistent boost that nurtures mental clarity and reduces the impact of everyday stressors.

The science behind adaptogenic mushrooms reveals how compounds like beta-glucans and antioxidants work to regulate your body‚Äôs stress response. This means they don‚Äôt just mask symptoms but actively support your nervous and immune systems. Understanding this helps you appreciate why a routine centered on these mushrooms can improve focus, mood, and energy levels over time. Making adaptogenic mushrooms a regular part of your day isn‚Äôt just about following a trend; it‚Äôs about reshaping how your body handles stress for a healthier, more balanced life.

By choosing to adopt this approach, you take a simple yet meaningful step toward enhancing your resilience and supporting long-term health. The key lies in consistency and mindful use, which together can create a foundation for wellness that lasts. As you grow more familiar with how adaptogenic mushrooms impact your body and mind, you can fine-tune your routine to match your unique needs, making each day more centered and calm.

1k4ug9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1k4ug9r/everything_went_horribly_wrong/,Everything Went Horribly Wrong,"Jake stared at his phone in disbelief. Another day, another sea of red. The S&P 500 down nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq taking an even worse beating. His retirement account was down 30% in just three months.

""What's wrong, honey?"" asked his wife Sarah, peering over his shoulder.

""Everything,"" Jake muttered. ""Absolutely everything.""

=== =====

It had all started so promisingly. The economy handed over in January was the envy of the world‚Äîlow unemployment, steadily decreasing inflation, and markets at all-time highs. America's economic recovery had been faster and stronger than any other nation's.

Then came the tariffs.

At first, they seemed like just another campaign promise being fulfilled. A bit of tough talk for the base. Everyone assumed there was some grand strategy‚Äîart of the deal and all that. The first wave hit China. Then Europe. Then Japan. Then everyone.

""What exactly do you want from us?"" the Japanese trade delegation had reportedly asked during negotiations in Washington.

""What are you offering?"" came the reply.

""Well, what is it that you want?""

Silence. They didn't know.

The Japanese delegation left without a deal.

=== =====

By April, the markets had fallen off a cliff. The dollar was cratering as a reserve currency. Gold soared. Everyone was scrambling for safety.

""Dad, what's happening?"" asked Jake's college-aged daughter on their weekly call. ""My professor says this is worse than 2008.""

""I wish I knew,"" Jake replied. ""All I know is someone with no coherent vision or plan is torpedoing everything.""

That afternoon, Jake's company announced layoffs. Twenty percent of the workforce, effective immediately. Manufacturing costs had skyrocketed due to tariffs on components they needed from overseas.

Sarah's job was affected too. Her tech company's stock had plummeted 40%, forcing a hiring freeze and project cancellations. The IPO they'd been counting on was indefinitely postponed.

=== =====

""Remember when we used to warn the world about China?"" Jake's coworker Tom remarked as they cleared out their desks. ""Now China is warning everyone about us.""
Jake thought about his 401(k), the college fund for his youngest, the mortgage that suddenly felt much heavier.

""You know what's crazy?"" Tom continued. ""None of this had to happen. There was no pandemic, no natural disaster. Just one man's decisions.""

That evening, as Jake scrolled through social media, he saw people debating whether to call it a recession yet. The more academic types were using phrases like ""voluntary surrender of superpower status"" and ""self-inflicted economic wound.""

A notification pinged on his phone. Another all-caps message from the President blaming the Federal Reserve Chair for not cutting rates.

""How would rate cuts even help when tariffs are causing inflation?"" Sarah asked, reading over his shoulder.

Jake just shook his head. ""It's like watching someone set fire to their house and then blaming the fire department for not using enough water.""

=== =====

Two weeks later, Jake still hadn't found new work. The severance was decent, but watching the markets continue to crater each day was psychologically destroying. Everything they'd built over decades was evaporating.

""I heard the Japanese Prime Minister said they won't just keep conceding in tariff talks,"" Sarah said, reading the news over breakfast. ""And now India has added more tariffs on steel. It's like everyone's racing backward.""

""The dildo of consequences arrives, coated in superglue and broken glass,"" Jake quoted from a finance forum he'd been following.

Sarah nearly spit out her coffee. ""That's... graphic.""

""But accurate,"" Jake replied.

His phone buzzed. A former colleague who'd moved to Europe last year was messaging:

""People here are dumbfounded. They almost feel sorry for us. Almost.""

Jake put down his phone and looked at Sarah. ""How did we get here? Just three months ago, we were on top of the world.""

Sarah reached for his hand across the breakfast table. ""I don't know. But maybe we should start thinking about how to weather what's coming. It feels like we're just at the beginning.""
Jake nodded solemnly. ""I'm afraid you're right. This isn't ending anytime soon.""

My name is Kait.  I‚Äôm currently 18, turning 19 in early June, and feel as though I lack an outside-of-work-or-online social life.  All of my current friends from high school are wonderful‚Äî However, everybody EXCEPT for me in this group seems to never care for a social life outside of playing games online or calling.  Everyone that I know is very kind, but they refuse to go anywhere (not even to a coffee shop once in a while, to the mall, or anything casual that would involve going outside).   I‚Äôve managed to get some of them to go to the odd concert with me, or to go to a baseball game with me, but it‚Äôs a once-every-few-months ordeal.  I‚Äôm tired of only having friends that refuse to leave the house, and are perfectly fine with never socializing beyond a screen.  I‚Äôll always be close to this group, since I respect and love them as people, but would love another group of friends who still love playing games and whatever, but also love going out and regularly doing other things outside.

I don‚Äôt care for drinking, partying, etc‚Ä¶ Even when I‚Äôm of legal age in less than 2 months, I doubt that I‚Äôll spend most of my time in bars, night clubs, or drinking parties.  I don‚Äôt hate it, and drink on occasions with family, but don‚Äôt care to ‚Äòget wasted‚Äô, do drugs (the only exception being üçÉ‚Äî and, even then, I don‚Äôt want to smoke it (only ever took gummies and hate smoking) or do it to a point where I‚Äôm absolutely out of my mind), or drink on a regular basis.  Wouldn‚Äôt mind the odd fun club night when I‚Äôm legal, but don‚Äôt care for people who only enjoy going places to get drunk and stoned.

I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äògrandma hobbies‚Äô and artistic + writing sort of person, and would love friends with similar interests.  Gaming is still cool, of course (especially people who like the odd session of Minecraft, Roblox, Stardew Valley, Gartic Phone, Nintendo games, etc.), but preferably people who also love OTHER hobbies, such as creative writing, artistic stuff (painting, drawing, music, makeup, etc.), thrifting, and just exploring cool things/going to fun things in and around Toronto.  Random, but I‚Äôm also a big retro (70s-80s-90s) buff.  Not a dealbreaker for me if my friends don‚Äôt care for that stuff, but it is and would be a plus.  LOL!

This isn‚Äôt an offer‚Äî like, I‚Äôm not looking to meet with random people who respond to this post‚Äî however, I am asking if anyone can tell me‚Ä¶ **What social groups, clubs, etc. can I join in either Toronto or around Pickering-Ajax-Whitby that fit my interests, and would give me a chance to regularly meet more people who feel like I do?**  Not looking for dating-related events, but would consider dating a guy (I‚Äôm straight LOL) if we met and really bonded in that way.  Not specifically looking for it, though‚Äî mainly looking for some good, fun friends.

I‚Äôve tried Googling, and have signed up for Meetup, but just feel like I don‚Äôt know where to start or where to look to find the best, most legitimate, and least sketchy options.  Thank you for reading my Ted Talk!

It been nearly two years since my dad passed away and 17 years since my mom. I miss them both terribly and don't have much in the way of a support system. No husband, no children and two older siblings, one of whom has completely ignored me and the other who has been verbally and emotionally abusive to the point where I no longer wish to be around her.

Beyond that, the friends I have are few and far between. I'm so tired of always being the one to reach out and getting little to no response. No one ever bothers to check in on me and when I reach out, I either get no response or they're always too busy or flaking out on plans.  I don't even want to talk about anything grief-related.

I just want to not be lonely and to have other people to spend time with. It could be as simple as a walk or a quick cup of coffee, but no one ever is available or responsive.

The kind where you don‚Äôt really want to talk, but you also don‚Äôt want to stay in the same room with your thoughts.

So I went to a rooftop caf√©.  
No one to meet. No plan. Just me and the open sky above a city that never pauses.

The place was softly lit, and the music‚Äîoh, the music‚Äîfelt like it knew exactly how to hold space for my heart. Not loud. Not sad. Just‚Ä¶ aesthetic. Thoughtful. Like someone whispering, *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone, even in your solitude.‚Äù*

I sat there with a warm cup of coffee, watching the city glow beneath me, headlights dancing like stars on the move. I didn‚Äôt scroll, I didn‚Äôt write, I didn‚Äôt even think much. I just let the moment happen.

And strangely, I started to feel better, not fixed, but softer.  
More held. More okay with being not okay.

We often talk about self-care as if it were a checklist. But sometimes, it‚Äôs just showing up for yourself in small ways ‚Äî a quiet corner, a hot drink, and music that speaks the language of your soul.

1k4u2b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteNerds/comments/1k4u2b7/dishwasher_repairs_london_common_problems_when_to/,Dishwasher Repairs London: Common Problems & When to Call the Experts,"A dishwasher is one of those appliances you don‚Äôt fully appreciate until it stops working. One day, it‚Äôs quietly humming along, saving you from endless scrubbing‚Äîthe next, it‚Äôs leaking, refusing to drain, or just sitting there like a fancy cupboard. If you‚Äôre in London and your dishwasher‚Äôs acting up, you‚Äôre not alone. The good news? Most issues have straightforward fixes‚Äîor at least, they do when you know who to call.

**The Usual Suspects: Common Dishwasher Problems**

First, let‚Äôs talk about the classics. If your dishwasher‚Äôs not cleaning properly, chances are it's clogged filters or a worn-out spray arm. Food debris builds up over time, and if you‚Äôre not giving it a quick rinse now and then, you might end up with half-washed plates and a lingering smell. A simple clean might do the trick, but if the problem persists, it could be a pump issue‚Äîsomething best left to the pros.

Then there‚Äôs the dreaded leak. A small puddle under the machine might just be a loose hose, but if water‚Äôs pooling fast, you‚Äôll want to shut it off and get help before your kitchen turns into a paddling pool. And what about when it won‚Äôt start at all? Could be a tripped circuit, a faulty door latch, or‚Äîworst-case scenario‚Äîan internal electrical fault. If you‚Äôve checked the basics (yes, even the plug) and it‚Äôs still dead, it‚Äôs time to bring in the experts.

**When to DIY and When to Dial for Help**

Some problems are easy enough to tackle yourself. A blocked filter? Grab a brush and give it a scrub. Strange noises? Maybe a spoon‚Äôs escaped into the wrong corner. But if you‚Äôre facing mysterious error codes, major leaks, or a dishwasher that‚Äôs just given up the ghost, trying to fix it yourself could make things worse and more expensive. That‚Äôs where [dishwasher repairs London](https://elserve.co.uk/) specialists like ELSERVE come in. They‚Äôve seen it all‚Äîfrom stubborn limescale build-up in hard water areas to complex motor failures. And because they‚Äôre local, they can often get to you the same day, saving you from a mountain of dirty dishes.

**Why Quick Repairs Beat Waiting It Out**

Ignoring a faulty dishwasher rarely ends well. What starts as a minor annoyance can turn into a full breakdown‚Äîor worse, water damage. And let‚Äôs be honest, nobody wants to hand-wash a week‚Äôs worth of plates while waiting for a replacement. For reliable [appliance repairs London](https://elserve.co.uk/) homeowners trust, companies like ELSERVE offer fixed-rate pricing, no hidden fees, and same-day service. Plus, their team knows the quirks of different brands, so whether it‚Äôs a Bosch, Samsung, or an older model, they‚Äôll diagnose the issue fast.

**Don‚Äôt Let a Broken Dishwasher Ruin Your Routine**

A dishwasher on the fritz is more than an inconvenience‚Äîit‚Äôs a daily disruption. But with the right help, you can get back to letting the machine do the dirty work. If your dishwasher‚Äôs misbehaving, sometimes the smartest move is to call in the experts, grab a coffee, and let them handle the rest. If you are in need of a repair, ELSERVE‚Äôs team is just a call away. Nobody needs to face a kitchen crisis alone.",1,1745284316.0,WriteNerds,0,1.0,False

I am going to be in London for 5 days next month and am trying to plan my itinerary. Would appreciate any feedback/suggestions - none of this is confirmed yet but would like to confirm it ASAP and book anything that needs prior booking! Thanks all :)

For reference, I am a morning person, enjoy museums and walking, and am looking to explore as much as I reasonably can. There are some things I don't think I care to go inside of and have noted those (try to convince me otherwise?). Will also be exploring alone so will be able to go according to my own pace. Food/drink is not a concern as I have a lot of options in different areas. 

  
Day 1: Sunday in Kensington (some places close early on Sunday)

* Arriving to my hotel in Kensington around 10am
* Grabbing coffee nearby
* Kensington Palace and Gardens
* Victoria and Albert Museum
* Harrods and grabbing food
* Hyde Park and Holland Park

Day 2: Monday in Westminster/Covent Garden

* Breakfast
* Walking to Buckingham Palace, Palace of Westminster, Big Ben, London Eye (not going inside any, just seeing; Buckingham Palace tickets not avail for my dates unfortunately)
* Southbank Book Market and Waterloo Bridge
* Lunch nearby
* Victoria Embankment Gardens
* National Gallery and Trafalgar Square
* Shops: ex. Maison Assouline, Fortnum and Mason, Waterstones
* Exploring the area and dinner nearby

Day 3: Tuesday in Marylebone and surroundings

* Breakfast
* British Museum at opening
* Wallace Collection
* Lunch
* Stores in Marylebone (ex. Daunt Books and Selfridges)
* Dinner: Mayfair Chippy

Wednesday and Thursday: heading to Manchester Wed morning and returning Thurs late afternoon

* Returning to hotel in Victoria, London - will spend evening walking around and grab dinner nearby

Day 4: Friday in Greenwich

* Grab breakfast/coffee then take boat to Greenwich
* Spend the day in Greenwich: Market, Old Royal Navy College, Park, Observatory
* Potentially heading up to see Canary Wharf (is this worth it?)

Day 5: Saturday in Notting Hill and East London. I don't have a huge interest in each and the things I want to do in each seem like they would not take up a whole day, so combining them made sense to me? I realize they're on opposite ends and would take around 45-1hr to get to the other side! Would appreciate feedback on if this day makes sense/is reasonable or if I should move things around!

* Breakfast and coffee in Notting Hill
* Bookshop and Portobello Market (want this on a Saturday for the full experience)
* Snack then head to East London
* Brick Lane Market; Classic Football Shirts
* Tower Bridge (not inside)
* Borough Market for late lunch
* Then walking around: Millennium Bridge, St Paul's (not inside), Leadenhall Market
* Sky Garden or Horizon 22 for sunset if I get tickets

My name is Kait.  I‚Äôm currently 18, turning 19 in early June, and feel as though I lack an outside-of-work-or-online social life.  All of my current friends from high school are wonderful‚Äî However, everybody EXCEPT for me in this group seems to never care for a social life outside of playing games online or calling.  Everyone that I know is very kind, but they refuse to go anywhere (not even to a coffee shop once in a while, to the mall, or anything casual that would involve going outside).   I‚Äôve managed to get some of them to go to the odd concert with me, or to go to a baseball game with me, but it‚Äôs a once-every-few-months ordeal.  I‚Äôm tired of only having friends that refuse to leave the house, and are perfectly fine with never socializing beyond a screen.  I‚Äôll always be close to this group, since I respect and love them as people, but would love another group of friends who still love playing games and whatever, but also love going out and regularly doing other things outside.

I don‚Äôt care for drinking, partying, etc‚Ä¶ Even when I‚Äôm of legal age in less than 2 months, I doubt that I‚Äôll spend most of my time in bars, night clubs, or drinking parties.  I don‚Äôt hate it, and drink on occasions with family, but don‚Äôt care to ‚Äòget wasted‚Äô, do drugs (the only exception being üçÉ‚Äî and, even then, I don‚Äôt want to smoke it (only ever took gummies and hate smoking) or do it to a point where I‚Äôm absolutely out of my mind), or drink on a regular basis.  Wouldn‚Äôt mind the odd fun club night when I‚Äôm legal, but don‚Äôt care for people who only enjoy going places to get drunk and stoned.

I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äògrandma hobbies‚Äô and artistic + writing sort of person, and would love friends with similar interests.  Gaming is still cool, of course (especially people who like the odd session of Minecraft, Roblox, Stardew Valley, Gartic Phone, Nintendo games, etc.), but preferably people who also love OTHER hobbies, such as creative writing, artistic stuff (painting, drawing, music, makeup, etc.), thrifting, and just exploring cool things/going to fun things in and around Toronto.  Random, but I‚Äôm also a big retro (70s-80s-90s) buff.  Not a dealbreaker for me if my friends don‚Äôt care for that stuff, but it is and would be a plus.  LOL!

This isn‚Äôt an offer‚Äî like, I‚Äôm not looking to meet with random people who respond to this post‚Äî however, I am asking if anyone can tell me‚Ä¶ **What social groups, clubs, etc. can I join in either Toronto or around Pickering-Ajax-Whitby that fit my interests, and would give me a chance to regularly meet more people who feel like I do?**  Not looking for dating-related events, but would consider dating a guy (I‚Äôm straight LOL) if we met and really bonded in that way.  Not specifically looking for it, though‚Äî mainly looking for some good, fun friends.

I‚Äôve tried Googling, and have signed up for Meetup, but just feel like I don‚Äôt know where to start or where to look to find the best, most legitimate, and least sketchy options.

After my husband graduated high school and prior to him joining the military, his family went on a cruise. While on the cruise, he became close friends with a girl. Now, my husband has gravitated towards females his entire life, but it was clear that he became emotionally attached to her. They allegedly promised to always be there for the other when needed and they shared some really deep conversations on the cruise. As you can imagine, I was a very jealous teenage girl. He reassured me that it was nothing more and eventually I forgot about her. 

Fast forward 6 years later, and I‚Äôm on Facebook on our computer looking something up for my MIL. I swear I‚Äôm on my account (considering my husband and I have almost all of the same friends since we went to the same high school and now have each others family) and I go to check the notification on the messages. I see the girl from the cruise on there and I immediately realize that I‚Äôm on his account. At this point, I‚Äôm going to look anyway because I find this very odd. Basically, while our kids and I were away visiting family in another state, he was trying to contact her to tell her that he has these massive feelings for her. Eventually, he was successful. Apparently, these feelings for her would pop up every three-ish months for six years. While we were dating, engaged, married, and I gave birth to two kids, he was wondering ‚Äúwhat could‚Äôve been‚Äù. He even eventually told me that he made a choice to stay with me while on the cruise. Apparently he was thinking about jumping ship (not literally) and going out with her. 

It‚Äôs been 3 years since I found out about these reoccurring feelings, but I‚Äôm only just now fully processing it all in therapy. When we first talked about it, he said how he didn‚Äôt tell me because it didn‚Äôt affect our relationship at all and he never stopped putting me first. Eventually as I kept talking about it and processing it, he‚Äôd say how I‚Äôd just have to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù, ‚Äúthese are your emotions to deal with‚Äù, or my favorite: ‚Äútrust your fucking husband‚Äù. Now that I‚Äôm processing this professionally and I‚Äôm considering divorce, he‚Äôs being sympathetic and overly apologetic for the way he‚Äôs handled this. Is it bad that I feel like it‚Äôs too late for this? I get he‚Äôs trying, but I needed this years ago. 

To add to it, he also had a work crush at our last duty station that he confessed his attraction to. He says these things are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúuncontrollable‚Äù. Before dating me, apparently he would break up with his girlfriends over the summer just in case he found someone else. He also has anger issues. He‚Äôll throw things in my direction (but not *at me* ‚Ä¶ his words), punch holes in the wall of every place we‚Äôve lived but our current one, break stuff (ex: iPad, coffee table, white board), and say very nasty things to me. 

He wants to work this out. He‚Äôs agreed to go to therapy and I guess he‚Äôs reading some book about helping your spouse through your affair, but ugh.

I started mixing black coffee with a bit of ginger powder and cinnamon just for taste and health benefits, but after a few tries, I realized it had an unexpected side effect: significantly better control, focus, and a relaxed feeling down there during both solo and partnered sessions.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve consistently experienced:

Improved focus and mental presence

Less tension and sensitivity in the pelvic area

Greater emotional control‚Äîless urgency or racing thoughts

Longer-lasting sessions, with more awareness and ease during edging

Time to orgasm increased upwards of 20 minutes, both solo and with a partner, with consistent control throughout


Ratio (what works for me):

1 cup of black coffee (no sugar or cream)

1 teaspoon of ginger powder

1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder


I mix it well and drink it warm. I also strain the mixture through a sieve to avoid any ginger or cinnamon particles. Sometimes I feel the effects within an hour, but even after 2‚Äì3 hours, it still works. I've found that the effects are more noticeable if I use it consistently.

What really elevates it is combining the blend with the right techniques:

The start-and-stop method (edging)

Slow, deep breathing through the mouth‚Äîinhale calmly, and exhale longer and steadily to keep the body relaxed and in control


I once tried adding turmeric to this mix, thinking it might enhance things‚Äîbut for me, it actually dulled the effect. So I scrapped that and stuck with the original trio.

I‚Äôd love to know if anyone else has tried this or something similar‚Äîand whether it works for you as well! Happy to share more or answer questions if you‚Äôre curious.
