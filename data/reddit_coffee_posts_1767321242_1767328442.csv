As my title goes, finally decided to put myself again this year for a “date with purpose” 😅 It feels like this past months, I feel like an option to people I get to mingle with and because hindi talaga ako napupursue 😆 lagi tayong nasa friendzone na lang. So finally, I am putting myself out there again.

😬 What you initially need to know about me :

I am… a Gemini pero Introvert (medyo may times late ako magreply kasi madami ganap) and minsan matagal ako sumagot ha.

From QC - Northern chapter HAHA.

A plus size morena tita - need to mention this para di tayo nagsasayang ng time when physical matters

I am a certified furmom of 1 needy 3yr old pogi na pug.

2024 was a tough year to me so I am still recovering from all the emotional, financial and everything that I have lost in 2024, broke and broken but lumalaban na ng patas sa buhay. 2025, medyo nakuha ko na ang groove.

I enjoy long drives na ako ang driver naman.

I am a Coffee and beer drinker

Oh I prefer chats over call (again minsan matagal ako sumagot)

✌️ What I hope you are?

Conversationalist : Please be decent, I don't reply sa mga medyo pahook-up na banat kasi it's not my thing. I like to connect first.

A decent person who at least is a responsible son or brother. Bonus if furdad ka rin HEHE.

I hope may mag magtiyaga sa kasabawan ko at times and for not being consistent in replying kasi problem ko yan.

So let's see if this time i'll find that person na for the nth time!  :) If not then keri lang! ss ko lang to as proof that I have tried to socialized for the nth time!",1,1767328186.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

(with kids),"When is it ok to be open to dating after divorce? My three-year-long divorce was final last year, and I’ve started really enjoying life again. I haven’t been on a date in the time since I filed for divorce three years ago. 

For a while, I'd thought about messaging a guy I dated in high school who moved out of state. I really like him and was sad when he moved. He moved back a few years ago and I've been curious to see how he's been doing. Today, I decided just to send him a message asking how he is.  He got back and said he's well and asked me the same. That's it. I was just curious and figured, why not?

But I mentioned it to mom, and she said  it’s too soon. I just messaged him that’s it. I might get coffee to catch up if we've been messaging long enough, but I'm not thinking about a relationship. I don't ever want to rush it. She also said she would worry about how it would impact my kids. We're not getting married! It's just a message and a possible coffee date. She also said she worries my ex would find out and then take it out on our kids. I can't make every decision in my personal life based on what he might do.

Now, I'm not sure. I feel very good in my life and don't want to shut myself off from ever even going on a simple date.  I'd never want to jeopardize the well being of my kids. I wouldn't even get serious with anyone easily. I just don't see how just a casual message is an issue. Was I wrong to start being open to dating again? ",1,1767328111.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to be more intentional about where I spend my money lately, especially with cafés. I really want to support places that are actually local, community-driven, and not quietly backed by massive wealth or corporate interests.

For a while, I really enjoyed Fenyk Coffee & Social. On the surface, it felt like one of those rare spots that values community, creativity, and small-business culture. I liked spending time there and wanted to believe in what they stood for.

Over time though, I personally became uncomfortable with how the business is run and who’s actually behind it. Without getting into drama, it started to feel less like a grassroots café and more like another example of branding “local” while operating with priorities that don’t align with that image. It was disappointing, especially when you realize how common this is becoming.

This is my first time visiting. My plan is to start and end in London for my return flight home, and I’d love some help deciding on things to do in London that makes sense in terms of flow, energy, and time.

Lodging plans are very flexible this far out, so suggestions are welcome. I want lodging when I first arrive in London to be lower-cost (like a hostel or B&B), and my final days in London to be at a nice, mid-range hotel. It will be the only hotel I stay at during my trip, and I’d like it to be somewhere historic and unique as a treat to myself, not at a modern chain hotel.

I imagine the first few days I’ll have the highest energy (also jet lag), and my final days of traveling I’ll prefer more relaxing, cozy, possibly indulgent activities. I don’t need any day-trip recommendations; I’m traveling quite a bit the rest of my trip and have limited full days in London. I like exploring neighborhoods, history, art, music, food, cute shops, coffee and tea, books, and architecture. Planning to walk and use public transport. 

Here’s my schedule:

Day 2: Arrival in London. Flight lands at about 14:30 at LHR. Check into Palmers Lodge Swiss Cottage hostel. 

Day 3-4: Full days in London.

Day 5: In London until 12:00, then leaving for Bath. 

\--

Day 23: Arrive back in London about 17:00-21:00. Check into Limehouse Library Hotel. 

Day 24: Full day in London.

Day 25: Flight home leaves about 17:30 from LHR.

For years I tried to brute-force discipline. Wake at 5am. Gym daily. No alcohol. Track everything.

It worked in bursts. Then it collapsed. Then guilt. Then another attempt.

What finally broke the cycle was adding one thing: three written questions every morning. Not goals. Not affirmations. Just questions like:

* ""What am I avoiding today?""
* ""Where am I confusing motion with progress?""
* ""What would I do if I stopped trying to prove something?""

Answering in writing: before coffee, before the day starts, this became the anchor that held everything else in place.

Why it works (I think):

The gym isn't the keystone habit. The journal is. If I write in the morning, I go to the gym. If I go to the gym, I don't drink. If I don't drink, I sleep well. If I sleep well, I write the next morning.

Miss the journal? The whole chain wobbles.

It used to be a lunch bag and three bags of coffee (one of which was a Blue Mountain blend) for ¥2000. To me, that was a great deal. However, it's been ¥3000 these past two years, so it's getting to the point of being not worth it for me, especially not waking up early to trek down to the nearest Kaldi. I'm not a big fan of their New Years blend and dark roasts anyway, so that leaves the Blue Mountain blend. Plus, it's a much better deal when they do customer appreciation week and their coffee is half off, so I stocked up last time they had one. I do get use out of the tote bag, though, so I bought one off Mercari. Figured it's win-win, someone gets their coffee, and I get the tote bag off them for ¥400. 

Mr. Donuts used to essentially pay for itself, ¥2000 for 20 donuts and goods, ¥3000 for 30 donuts and goods, etc... Don't know if it does anymore, though. Plus, they didn't do a Pokémon collaboration lucky bag this year. 

St. Marcs caught my wife's eye for the goods, but there's none near us. I did mention, since we don't really eat there, why not just buy the goods off Mercari, let the person who bought it use the coupons.

I got a crown 2 years ago on a tooth with an old filling and a chip on it. Dentist recommended a crown instead of a filling. I opted for a gold crown since it seemed better than porcelain. I also got a night mouth guard from the dentist.

The cold sensitivity never went away, but it was very transient, so I wasn't concerned about it. If I chewed too much on that side of my mouth, I would have some mild pain. Then about 30-45 days ago, I had too much coffee and ended up clenching quite a bit. Afterwards, there was a persistent dull, throbbing pain in that tooth. The pain isn't always there, but I feel it at least several times a day. Always dull, and the pain is radiating more than before. Since then, I've been solely chewing on the pain-free side of my mouth, watching my coffee intake, etc.

The waiting period on my dental insurance ends on July 1. What are the odds this problem isn't too serious, and I can hold off until then? Even if I can make it, will waiting drastically increase the likelihood of a much more intensive/expensive treatment? Do I likely need a root canal? Can the gold crown be re-used?

I am looking for some advice as I cannot share this with anyone in my friend group and it’s causing me a lot of anxiety.

I [27F] have been very close friends with Spencer [28M] for over 7 years now. We have never dated or hooked up, we have the typical best girl-boy friend duo. Over the years, we have what I perceive as few flirty moments, but nothing has ever crossed a line. I’ve had few boyfriends over the years, he has not had anything serious. I care about him deeply and consider him one of the most important people in my life.

I occasionally will have feelings for Spencer. But I don’t date potential. He’s a great person but he’s pretty inexperienced when it comes relationships from what I have observed, such as being selfless sometimes. Something as small as only getting coffee for himself versus offering to grab one too has been an issue recently. That even his mom acknowledged is an issue. I am not 100% certain on his feelings for me because I’m not mind reader, but I do feel like there are moments. But because of all of this I’ve stayed in the friendship lane.

We recently went on a 3.5 week trip together, which is the longest trip we both have ever done outside of our family trips. It was great. We had few hiccups but we communicated them. Nothing romantic happened, but there were moments again. Everyone assumed we were together, but we didn’t necessarily go super out of the way to deny it as it got repetitive. 

After we got back, things felt a little quieter but it’s the holidays and we were both busy.

Spencer has a close friend named Eric [27M]. I’ve met Eric few times now, and a few weeks before the trip we all hung out. Eric asked me how I wasn’t dating anyone and what are my expectations for a man. There was a bit of unexpected chemistry there. But what stood out to me was that Eric was pushing the idea of Spencer and I dating. It was pretty explicitly. To the point that Spencer got upset when he heard my requirements, as he doesn’t meet the career one. I clocked it as him potentially liking me but I moved on.

Anyways Spencer and I got back from trip, his friend Eric set a time to grab drinks, but Spencer couldn’t make it. Eric and I met though, and this man again was pushing the idea of Spencer and I being together, but also flirting with me. He kept asking if I found Spencer attractive, that I need to give more signals, make Spencer feel confident etc. I explained to him I do enjoy the relationship I have with Spencer, but he must be the one to initiate something and also that I don’t think time is right.

Anyways, Eric wanted to go to a concert, so we decided to go together. Spencer was invited but couldn’t make it. At this concert, we had quite a bit of drinks and we started to dance and kiss after Eric made the move. After that night, I asked him to not say anything.

The next day I had crippling anxiety, but my sister and best friend reassured me that at the end of the day I’m single. I still felt bad but that was true. 

Following day after that, Eric asked me what my NYE plans were, and we end up going to an event together. I had no other plans and I was down for the plot. Spencer also did not want to go out. So Eric and I went out and same thing, only this time it felt like we were crossing line more.  

Today I am struggling with how to move from this. Eric doesn’t even live here, so I’m not too worried. I think I’m more worried about how this will affect my relationship with Spencer.

I don’t know what Spencer feels and at this moment he knows nothing. My biggest fear is I just ruined the potential of us trying to be together. But I seriously just lost myself in the moment.

I don’t have romantic feelings for Eric. What I’m struggling with is the fear that this could affect my friendship with Spencer if it ever comes out. Eric agreed to keep things private, but I can’t fully control that.

Spencer and I were never dating, never exclusive, and he’s had years to express interest if he wanted to. At the same time, I would be devastated to lose him as a friend, and I’m second guessing whether I handled this poorly or if I’m holding myself to expectations that were never clearly defined.

Any perspective on how to move forward, especially from people who’ve navigated messy friend group dynamics would really help.

TLDR: I have a close friendship with someone I care about, but we’ve never dated. I recently made out with someone in his circle and now I’m unsure how to handle the friendship moving forward.

[$1000],"I'm a pure beginner with 0 experience in coffee making and I'm keen on buying machine to start. I do not mind having a more complicated machine as long as I'm able to make some damn good coffee to impress my partner. We both enjoy milk based coffee and my family enjoys a good Americano/espresso.

Here comes the issue. My family are less interested in going through the trouble of learning the entire full process of making a good cup of coffee whereas I'm willing to learn all the complicated stuff to impress my partner.

So, here's my question. Do I go with a 2-in-1 to allow my family to have a bit of a convenience in single dosing/tampering or do I buy separate machines and prep things before hand to let them have an ease?  
Is there a huge difference in terms of consistency and taste between a 2-in-1 compared to separate machines? My aim is not a perfect cup of coffee but rather just a consistent good cup of coffee that's able to match or be better than most cafes out there.

If it's a 2-in-1 I'm looking at Breville Barista Express +  
If it's a separate one I'm looking at Breville Bambino and Varia v3 Grinder/DF64

If there's any suggestions in different machines, I'm more than happy to check it out in terms of the differences and learn more as well.

I'm new here so please do educate me in the differences. Appreciate all the kind insights and responses. Thank you.

Today I am struggling with how to move from this. Eric doesn’t even live here, so I’m not too worried. I think I’m more worried about how this will affect my relationship with Spencer.

I don’t know what Spencer feels and at this moment he knows nothing. My biggest fear is I just ruined the potential of us trying to be together. But I seriously just lost myself in the moment.

I don’t have romantic feelings for Eric. What I’m struggling with is the fear that this could affect my friendship with Spencer if it ever comes out. Eric agreed to keep things private, but I can’t fully control that.

Spencer and I were never dating, never exclusive, and he’s had years to express interest if he wanted to. At the same time, I would be devastated to lose him as a friend, and I’m second guessing whether I handled this poorly or if I’m holding myself to expectations that were never clearly defined.

I’m trying to figure out:
1. Whether I should say anything to Spencer or let things be?
2. How to move on from this?

Any perspective on how to move forward, especially from people who’ve navigated messy friend group dynamics would really help.

TLDR: I have a close friendship with someone I care about, but we’ve never dated. I recently made out with someone in his circle and now I’m unsure how to handle the friendship moving forward.

I don’t really know why I’m posting this now.

It’s 2:18 AM, and I keep checking my hallway even though I know there’s nothing there. I’ve checked it so many times tonight that the carpet has started to feel unfamiliar under my feet.

This started a few weeks ago, and at first it was nothing.

I live alone in a small apartment on the third floor. Thin walls. Old building. You hear things. Pipes. Footsteps that aren’t really footsteps. I’ve lived here long enough to know the difference.

Or at least I thought I did.

The first thing I noticed was my phone.

I woke up one morning to a missed call from my own number. No voicemail. Just one missed call at 3:12 AM. I assumed it was a glitch. I’ve had weirder bugs happen after updates. I deleted it and forgot about it before my coffee was done.

Two nights later, it happened again.

Same time. 3:12 AM. Same thing. Missed call. My number.

I checked my call history more carefully that time. No outgoing call. Just an incoming one that didn’t make sense.

I told myself it was nothing. Phones do stupid things.

That night, though, I woke up exactly at 3:12.

No alarm. No noise. Just awake.

My phone was on my nightstand, screen dark. The room felt… off. Not cold or anything dramatic. Just quiet in a way that felt deliberate, like someone had turned the volume of the world all the way down.

I lay there for a minute, listening.

Then I heard it.

Breathing.

Not loud. Not exaggerated. Just slow, steady breathing.

I held my own breath without realizing it. The sound didn’t change. It wasn’t coming from the hallway. It wasn’t right next to me either.

It sounded like it was coming from the phone.

I reached for it and the sound stopped immediately.

The screen lit up.

No missed call. No notification.

I didn’t sleep after that.

The next day, I checked my carbon monoxide detector. It was fine. I texted my sister about it, half-joking. She told me I was probably stressed and needed sleep. She wasn’t wrong about the sleep part.

Things stayed normal for a while after that. Almost two weeks. I convinced myself I’d imagined the breathing. Sleep paralysis, maybe. I’d read enough threads to diagnose myself.

Then I came home early from work one afternoon.

My apartment door was unlocked.

I’m careful about that stuff. Almost obsessive. I stood there for a long time before going in, listening for movement. Nothing. Everything inside looked exactly the same.

Except my bedroom door was open.

I always close it when I leave. I don’t know why. Habit, I guess.

I checked my phone records. No calls. No messages. Nothing strange.

That night, I didn’t put my phone on the nightstand. I left it charging in the kitchen.

I woke up at 3:12 anyway.

This time, the breathing was closer.

It was coming from inside the room.

I sat up slowly, heart pounding so hard I was sure it would drown everything else out. The room was dark, but not pitch black. Streetlight through the blinds. Enough to see shapes.

The closet door was open.

It hadn’t been when I went to bed.

The breathing was coming from there.

I didn’t move. I didn’t scream. I didn’t even think, really. I just listened.

After maybe a minute, it stopped.

The silence afterward was worse.

I slept on the couch with the lights on for the next few nights. Nothing happened. No calls. No breathing. I started to feel stupid again. Paranoid.

That’s when I made the mistake of checking my phone backups.

I don’t know what I expected to find. Proof that I was losing it, maybe.

Instead, I found audio files.

Short recordings. Less than a minute each. Automatically saved. Dated nights I was asleep.

The first one was just static and movement. Fabric shifting. A faint hum, like the room tone of my apartment.

Then I heard myself breathing.

Slow. Deep. Asleep.

I almost closed the app then. I wish I had.

In the background, behind my breathing, there was another sound.

Someone else, breathing slightly out of sync with me.

Closer to the microphone.

The last recording was from two nights ago.

I don’t remember making it.

At the end of that one, the breathing stops.

Then a whisper, so quiet I had to replay it with headphones.

It says my name.

Not spoken like someone calling out.

Spoken like someone checking.

Tonight, at 3:12, my phone rang.

Not from my number.

From a blocked one.

I didn’t answer.

It rang until it stopped on its own.

Now I’m sitting on my bed, typing this, trying not to look at the closet.

Because a minute ago, my phone vibrated.

No call.

Just a notification from my voice recorder.

A new file.

1q1okn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1q1okn3/where_should_we_go/,Where should we go?,"My wife and I [37m/f] from Denver plan on booking a trip June 10th-14th direct flight cancun. We go every 6 months and try a new resort each time. My wife normally books for us but I want to surprise her with a graduation present. Our budget would be 1200/pp flexible one day 11th-15th. Somewhere close to airport max 40 min.We normally book on cheap caribbean or americanforcestravel.

Hotel access on a Waterfront beach. We normally upgrade rooms or try to be in preferred club but would be willing to have a standard room at a nicer resort.
Great room A/c is a must, we can't sleep without it. Why we would upgrade rooms, an outdoor shower (idk, we love them) preferred club (private pool section, upgraded drinks, included upgraded room service, beach view.

We typically stick to ourselves and like to relax and enjoy our vacation together. we like a mix of pools and ocean. won't be doing any excursions or traveling from the resort. We wake up late 8-9am and go to bed after the resort night shows 10-11pm. Not big drinkers but appreciate good cocktails and breakfast mimosas and typically drink our max by dinner, so night scene is not big on our list. We do love coffee and tea options all through the day! We love to explore and walk around every inch of a resort and resorts next to them but wouldn't  like a ton of people packed in, we haven't stayed in one of those mega resorts. We dont mind a ton of animals and nature paths on a huge sized resort though. 

The beach/ocean snorkeling on site is a must [we do not mind seaweed and smell but focus on access to great snorkeling.
We love to move around in pools from family pools to private adult only quiet pools. 
We love to night swim so if any resorts have a 24 hour bar pool that stays open a bonus! 

Food wise we are not picky. We loved the Preferred club morning breakfast on the beach type of places like princess riveria, or dreams sapphire. We love tacos and if a place has good tacos we usually skip out on dinner and eat those. We liked the steakhouse, Asian, Mediterranean,  hibachi and stay away from everything else like Mexican and Italian food. Lunch buffet option would be nice. We usually are stuffed from breakfast and busy from the day we just eat dinner. *Smoothie bar/ice cream bonus! This resort doesn't have to be adult only romantic type, we usually do that in November. *Bonus a cigar friendly place i smoke 1 per day!

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

1q1oj8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegaslocals/comments/1q1oj8y/has_anyone_checked_out_nowhere_at_fontainebleau/,Has anyone checked out Nowhere at Fontainebleau yet? Actually impressed.,"So I finally got around to checking out Nowhere, that speakeasy-style jazz lounge on Level 2 at Fontainebleau, and honestly? It's not what I expected from a Strip property.

First off, it's actually chill. No EDM blasting your eardrums, no bachelorette parties screaming over bottle service. Just live jazz Thursday through Sunday (8pm-midnight weeknights, 9pm-1am weekends), solid cocktails, and an atmosphere where you can actually have a conversation.

# The Good Stuff

The live music is legit. They rotate different acts—saw Jennifer Keith Sextet when I went and they were fantastic. Not just background noise, actual talented musicians who know what they're doing. The room's intimate enough that it feels special without being cramped.

Cocktails are pricey (it's Fontainebleau, so yeah), but they're actually well-made. The bartenders know their stuff and aren't just following a recipe book. Got an espresso martini that was perfectly balanced, and my friend's Millionaire's Row was creative without being gimmicky.

Unexpected bonus: there's a pool table and some other random games tucked in different rooms. Makes it feel less formal and more like somewhere you'd actually want to hang out versus just pose for photos.

Oh, and if you eat or drink there, you get complimentary valet. Small thing but appreciated when you're not trying to deal with Fontainebleau's massive parking structure.

# The Reality Check

**Dress code is enforced.** They're serious about the ""trendy and fashionable attire"" thing. So don't show up in shorts and sneakers thinking you'll talk your way in—you won't. It's Vegas, we all have something decent in our closets, just plan accordingly.

Cover charge varies depending on the night and performer, so check ahead if that matters to you.

It's still a tourist spot, so expect some people taking 47 selfies and groups that don't know jazz etiquette. But it's not as bad as you'd think for a Strip venue.

# Worth It for Locals?

If you're tired of the same Henderson bars or hitting up Arts District for the millionth time, yeah, it's a solid option. Good for dates, small groups, or just when you want to feel fancy without the full Strip nightclub insanity.

They're open 6pm-late daily (also do coffee service Friday-Sunday mornings 7am-noon if you're into that). Located at 2777 S Las Vegas Blvd, Level 2.

Anyone else been? Curious what nights have the best performers or if there are any locals nights/deals I'm missing.",6,1767326528.0,vegaslocals,3,0.8,False
1q1ohgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_scottjohnday/comments/1q1ohgp/rf_blind_date/,[RF]  Blind Date,"BLIND DATE     
         

Blane Collins was in his senior year of college and had never been on a date before. He had always been a big boy who was teased a lot. He did not have a lot of self confidence. Actually he didn't have any. Here he was in his senior year of college and still never had a date. One of his classmates thought it would be a great joke to set him up on a blind date with someone that was in one of the classmates other classes. What he didn't tell Blane was that Cindy was heavy. As she had topped 250 pounds a while ago and was still climbing. If he had been told, it wouldn't have made any difference. He was heavy and his entire family was heavy. His mother loved to cook these extravagant meals followed by rich desserts. You couldn't be thin in her house.
      
When Blane called they had trouble finding a time that was good for both of them. Both were reluctant to meet in person and were avoiding it. They wound up talking on the phone for a couple of months before they were able to work up the courage to meet each other in person. Blane loved talking with Cindy. She had a really sweet voice and he could tell she was a very kind person. She was smart but wasn't sure what she was going to do after graduation. She was thinking about teaching. She would have to wait and see.
      
When they finally met, it was at a small restaurant that was popular with the students. When they met, Cindy felt like she was seen for the first time. Not judged for her appearance but seen and accepted for who she was. The restaurant was busy so they were able to talk for several minutes while waiting for a table, then they were seated. It was then that tragedy struck. The chair Cindy was offered was broken. It had been set aside to be repaired, but someone had brought it back out to the dining room. When Cindy sat on it, it collapsed. Blane helped her to her feet and rushed to find the server to get another chair for her. As she was standing there shaken, several people were openly pointing and laughing. Cindy ran out the door in tears. Blane tried calling her to explain that the chair had been broken and should have never been there but she never answered any of his calls or responded to any of his messages. Blane looked for her at graduation, but she was not there. He felt totally lost. The first girl that he had made a connection with and this happens. Maybe he was supposed to be single for his entire life.
     What Blane didn't know was that this event triggered a mental breakdown with Cindy. She couldn't face anyone and arranged to have her diploma mailed to her citing a family emergency that needed to be cared for. 

She started an intensive psychiatric treatment. It took a lot of work on her part but started to realize that any time she had anything happen in her life, she had been given food to soothe it. Her mother had always been told that the more plump the child was, the healthier the child was. She could still hear her mother always saying “A skinny child is a sick child.” When she was a child and had a bump while playing, she was given sugary treats to make her feel better. When someone would be mean to her, more treats. Any time she was stressed or hurt, she was taught to turn to food. 

She had never been taught how to address the problem she was facing. So she would eat whatever whenever anything stressed her and would gain more weight which caused more stress and the cycle continued. She joined a support program that helped her not only control her eating, but also control the emotions that were causing the binge eating. They celebrated with her when she dropped below 250 for the first time in such a long time. Not just for the weight loss, but because each of them understood the effort and the progress she had made in changing thinking and patterns. 

Cindy stuck with it until she finally reached a sustainable 150 pounds. She had gone from 294 to 150. Half of her body weight was gone. She never realized how sick and exhausted she had always felt. She now realized she was literally eating herself to death. She still had to resist the urge to eat whenever she was stressed but now it was manageable. Now the challenge was maintaining a balance. Eating healthy but not too much or too little.
     
Blane had tried to find out what happened to Cindy, but could never find her. He finally gave up when it was time for him to start law school. Law school was an intense time for Blane and he had to focus on that. Eventually he started not thinking about Cindy all the time. Occasionally he would think of her with longing but he was focused on law school now.
      
Blane's roommate in law school was raised completely different from how Blane grew up as far as food. Only natural organic foods were allowed in his house, along with lots of exercise. Blane had to quickly admit that his roommate was more alert and could study longer and had an easier time than he was.
    
The roommate looked at the food that Blane was eating and pointed out what was in it. He challenged Blane to eat the same things as he did for a month with no cheating. If Blane couldn't feel a difference, he wouldn't mention it again. At the end of the month Blane had to admit that he had more energy and had better mental clarity. After the thirty day trial period, the next time Blane ate something that he used to eat all the time, it made him sick. He had to admit his roommate was on to something. The roommate later told Blane the reason that he challenged him was the smell of the food Blane was cooking caused him to want to vomit.
      
Not only was Blake doing better at school, but he also trimmed down. He would always be a big man but he was no longer obese. His clothes fit better and he had a lot more confidence in himself. He started to have girls flirting with him but he was too focused on finishing law school to pay attention to them. 
     
After passing the bar, Blane started with the District Attorney’s Office as his first job. He started helping with preparing cases to be prosecuted. Then he was given his first case to prosecute. It seemed like a simple case. A young man went on a crime spree robbing several places. There was video footage of him, his DNA was found at each scene, his cell phone data showed him at each scene at the time of each crime, and the weapon was on him when he was arrested. A simple open and shut case. The detectives did their job thoroughly. The young man was offered a generous plea deal. But he was from a family that had quite a bit of money so they hired a high priced attorney. One of the best in town. Blane actually learned a lot from this attorney.
      
The first thing the attorney did was have the defendant refuse the plea deal and to go with a jury trial. He then started filing motions and Blake had to provide a response for each one. Then he started to file for continuances. He tried to get a dismissal which the judge denied. When he tried to get another continuance, the judge told him flatly that he had more than enough time to prepare and the trial was going to start on this date. There would be no more delays. Did he understand?
     
When the trial started the defense attorney objected to everything to see if he could get grounds for an appeal. Any witness or expert, the attorney grilled them. He questioned their recollection and how far away they were at the time. He questioned the experts on their qualifications, their methods, if they were sure they tested the right samples. Some started to falter, but most stood firm. Blane had spent time with each one to prepare them, explaining what the line of questioning would be and the manner they would be asked. He was so glad that he took the time to work with them. Most seemed to be unfazed by the hostility and gave convincing testimony. When it came time for his concluding argument, Blane tried to focus on the jury trying to read them. There was one juror that was focused intently on him with a puzzled look. He couldn't understand what she was thinking. She looked vaguely familiar like he had seen her somewhere before but wasn't sure.
     
She had pretty eyes and a beautiful smile and was very attractive. He was sure that he would have remembered her. He watched her as the jury left the courtroom. The jury announced they had a verdict after an hour. Guilty on all charges. Blane breathed a huge sigh of relief. Actually this was the first time he had been able to breathe since the trial started. He had to be on his toes the entire time to make sure the victims received justice.

During the sentencing the defendant's mother made a passionate plea for mercy. How he had always been a good boy that just got in with the wrong crowd. The principal from his high school testified how the boy had been in trouble the entire time he was at school. He showed no respect for any student or staff. He was not surprised at what happened. He was actually expecting worse. The victims testified how their lives had been impacted, not only financially but also mentally. 

The judge looked at the defendant and told him that he had not seen even a glimmer of remorse from the defendant the entire trial. He had seen nothing but contempt and disrespect. The judge then gave his sentence. lt was three times what he had been offered in the plea agreement plus ordered to pay restitution to the victims. The defendant was defiant down to the end, yelling obscenities and flipping off everyone, even his mother, as he was led out.
    
Blane had to take a couple of days to recover from that trial. It did teach him that you can never assume it is going to be an easy case, you can never over prepare. Even his boss was impressed by how he handled the case. If he had known that it was going to be that involved he would have put one of the most experienced attorneys on it. But it turned out well.
      
About a month after the trial Blane received a phone call at work. It was a female voice that started off hesitantly, “I'm not sure if this is appropriate or not because I was on the jury at the trial. I looked up your profile on the DA’s website and saw that we attended the same college. I think we went out on a date once.”
      
Blane caught his breath. He knew who it was as he only had one date the entire time he had been in school. He was trying to figure out which juror she was. It had to be the cute girl that was looking at him so intently.
      
Cindy continued “This is Cindy Baker. I just wanted to thank you for all you did for me back in college. You were the only one that accepted me for who I was and that was a turning point in my life. It helped me more than you will ever know.”

The first thing asked her was about her health. She didn't look the same as she did. Was it because of a health issue? She looked healthy but a lot of times you can't tell. She assured him that her health was good. That she was sorry about not returning all his calls at that time but she was just overwhelmed by everything. She had to get away for a while, and when she tried to reach out, she couldn't find him. It wasn't until the end of the trial that she thought she recognized him when he was so focused on the jury. It was the look she recognized. He asked if she would like to catch up sometime. They arranged to get coffee on Saturday.
     
It was an interesting meeting for both of them. They both were extremely nervous not really knowing what to expect. Once they started talking, it was like it was when they were in college. The conservation flowed easily. They wanted to know if the other was involved in a relationship and it turned out they were both still single. Cindy said that when she was heavy, he was the only one that would even talk to her. Now she couldn't trust that the men would accept her if she were still heavy. When she would be on a date and point out a girl that was not as heavy as she had been and ask if they would ever date someone that was heavy like that, they would make a face and say no way. Some would even make jokes about the poor girl's weight. She didn't find them funny at all.
     
When she asked about him, he said that he only had one date the entire time in school. Cindy gasped and said “I'm so sorry. Your one date turned into such a disaster!” He assured her that for him it wasn't so bad. It turned out that the chair was broken and had been pulled but one of the staff didn't realize why and put it back in the dining room. He had looked for her so he could tell her, then he started law school and had to really focus to get through it. When he started law school, he changed his phone carrier and got a new phone, but in the process he got a new number. Maybe they could try again and he would make sure to try the chair first himself. They both laughed.
    
They spent the rest of the day together mostly just talking. Cindy told him that she had become a counselor working with mostly young people that are struggling with emotional issues. It was fulfilling because she could relate with them and not judge them as some counselors did. There was something about seeing the change when a child realizes that there isn't anything wrong with them.
     
It was getting late so they said good night. Blake asked if she would like to get together again next weekend and she said “Of course”. They exchanged numbers then Blake gave her a quick kiss then he was gone. It was almost like it was when they were in college, except now it wasn't a blind date, they were going into this with their eyes wide open.

Our backyard garden is my place. My controlled little rectangle of earth. It’s the one thing in my life that’s always behaved the way it’s supposed to.

Until two days ago.

I noticed the bush at dusk.

It wasn’t subtle or small and was growing where my marigolds had been yesterday, hunkered in the corner nearest the fence like an animal that had crawled in to die. 

The bush was low and thorny. Its leaves were glossy like they’d been lacquered. The berries were clustered in heavy, swollen bunches, dark as bruises. Almost black… until the last slice of sunlight hit them, and they flashed a wet, deep red, the color of fresh-opened meat.

I stood there with my watering can tilted, and I remember thinking, very calmly: That isn’t mine.
I didn’t plant it, I don’t plant bushes. I plant vegetables and flowers and the occasional herb I swear I’ll use in meals and then forget until it bolts and turns bitter.

My brain tried to be reasonable. Birds drop seeds, squirrels bury things, and wind carries spores. All the everyday explanations that wrap the unknown in something domesticated.

Still, the air around it felt… wrong. Not like “fear striking wrong.” But like when my body rejects the smell of spoiled milk.

I told myself I’d deal with it in the morning.

That night, I dreamed my garden was underwater. The lettuce fronds waved like drowned hair. The carrots were pale fingers reaching upward and in the corner, where the bush crouched, something pulsed—slow, patient—like a heart.

I woke up with dirt under my fingernails.

I scrubbed them raw and told myself it was just stress.

Josh took the next day off work. Which was rare enough that it should’ve been a gift, but it immediately turned into one of those non-helpful days where someone who doesn’t know your system tries to improve it.

He came out in an old t-shirt, coffee in hand, squinting at the beds. “Okay,” he said, rubbing his hands together. “Tell me what I can do, Captain Garden.”

I was halfway through explaining which weeds to pull when he stopped and pointed. “What’s that?”

The bush seemed even bigger in daylight, like it had stretched overnight. The thorns were thin and pale, almost translucent, and when the wind moved them they made a sound like someone combing through wet hair.

“I don’t know,” I said. I kept my voice light, because Josh can turn anything into a joke if he senses fear. “It wasn’t there, and I didn’t plant it. Maybe a bird—”
“A bird planted an entire bush?” He leaned closer, amused. “Abbie, come on.”

“Josh.” My stomach knotted. “Don’t touch it.”

He looked back at me with that familiar grin, the one that’s always gotten him in trouble. “It’s a berry bush. Relax.”

“It’s not like any berry bush I’ve ever seen.”

“That’s because you only grow, what, kale and sadness?” He crouched. The berries hung close together, heavy enough to pull the stems down. A few had split, oozing dark juice that dried in glossy streaks along the bark like varnished blood.

Josh reached for one. I grabbed his wrist before he could pluck it.

“Josh. Please. We don’t know what that is.”

He didn’t yank away. He just looked at my hand on his, then up at me, softening. “Okay, Okay,” He waited until I loosened my grip. “I’m not gonna eat the weird murder berry, Abby.”

The moment I released him, he popped one free with his thumbnail and held it up, poised between finger and thumb.

He did it like it was a magic trick. Like he couldn’t help himself.

“Josh.” My voice came out sharper than I meant it. “Don’t.”
He smiled—still playful, still Josh—but there was something underneath it, like a kid daring himself. “If I die,” he said, “tell the kids I loved them and that I regret nothing.”

“Josh—”

He ate it.

Not just a nibble but he chewed it, slow and almost thoughtful. Juice ran over his lower lip, so dark it looked black until the sun caught it and turned it red.
For a second, I saw his throat work as he swallowed, and the skin over his Adam’s apple moved like something shifting under it.

He made a face. “Tastes like—” he coughed once, as if surprised. “Like dirt and… mint?”

“Spit it out!” I said, but it was already gone.

He straightened, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and shrugged. “See? I’m Fine. I’m invincible.”
He said it like the moment was done. Like my anxiety was silly.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to make him go inside and drink water and call poison control.

Instead, he coughed again.

Harder this time.

He turned away, hacking into his elbow like a polite person. The sound was wet, wrong, deep in his chest. He bent over, shoulders shaking.

“Josh?” I stepped toward him.

He coughed and something fluttered out of his mouth and landed on the soil.

A leaf fragment.

Not like a bit of salad. Like a crisp piece torn from a plant, the vein pattern is clearly visible. It lay there shining with saliva.

Josh cleared his throat, grimaced, and waved a hand. “Ugh. Probably from yesterday. When I mowed. Must’ve breathed it in.”

“That—” I stared at the leaf like it might move. “That’s not—”

“It’s fine,” he said too quickly. “Quit looking at me like that.”

He straightened fully and smiled again.

And then I saw his eyes.

Josh has always had that gray-blue gaze that looks like storm clouds trying to decide whether to rain. I’ve stared into those eyes during fights, during make-up, during the quiet exhaustion of parenthood. I know his face the way you know your own hands.

His irises were not a gray-blue anymore.

They were dark red.

Not bloodshot, not irritated, but red. A saturated, velvety crimson that matched the berries like they’d taken a sample and dyed him from the inside out. Against the white of his eyes, it looked impossibly wrong, like someone had swapped out his irises while I blinked.

He blinked slowly, and for a heartbeat I thought his pupils were slit. Catlike.

Then they were round again.

“Josh.” My voice dropped to a whisper. “Your eyes.”
He rubbed them with his palms. When he lowered his hands, the red was still there. He looked at my face and his smile faltered.

“What?” he said, a quick edge of irritation. “What are you doing?”

“I’m not doing anything,” I said. “Your eyes—”

He walked past me toward the house. “Maybe it’s the sun. Maybe it’s allergies. Jesus, Abbie, do you want me to panic? Because you’re acting like you want me to panic.”

“Josh—” I followed him, heart thudding, but he was already inside. The screen door slammed hard enough to rattle.

I stood alone in the garden.

The bush shivered.

But there was no wind, no sound of branches against branches, just the smallest tremor, like a creature settling into a deeper crouch.

I went to pull it out.

I swear I did.

I grabbed my gloves, and  my shovel. I told myself I was overreacting and that I’d feel stupid about everything later. I dug a circle around the base, shoved the spade down hard.

The soil resisted in a way soil shouldn’t. Not packed-hard, not root-tangled. It resisted like pushing into dense meat.

My shovel hit something that thunked, not like stone, more like cartilage.

I pushed again.

The ground gave out a little, and a smell rose up. Warm, and sweet, like rotting fruit and iron. Like a butcher shop with flowers in the window.

The bush didn’t have a root ball.

It had something like a spine.

Ridged, pale, and would flex when I pried.

I jerked back so fast I fell onto my butt in the dirt.
The bush’s leaves rustled. The berries trembled in their clusters as if laughing silently.

I left the shovel in the ground and ran inside.

Josh was in the kitchen, hands braced on the counter, breathing like he’d climbed stairs too fast. Henry sat at the table with his cereal, spoon paused halfway to his mouth, watching his dad like he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to be worried.

Courtney stood in the doorway filming on her phone.
“Dad’s being weird,” she said flatly, like she was narrating a nature documentary. “He keeps coughing up salad.”

“Courtney!” I snapped. “Stop.”

Josh coughed again, and this time it wasn’t a leaf fragment.

It was a whole leaf.

Green, slick with saliva. It slapped onto the counter and stuck there, trembling at the edge like it was still attached to something.

Henry made a small, strangled sound and started to cry.

Josh’s shoulders shook as he tried to swallow back the cough. His throat bulged and the muscles there rippled like a snake moving under skin.

His mouth opened and something pushed out.
At first, I thought it was his tongue swollen, lolling forward. Then I realized it wasn’t flesh at all.

It was a stem.

Pale, wet, forcing its way between his lips, splitting the corner of his mouth. Josh’s lips tore. A bright bead of blood appeared, then another, then it ran down his chin.

The stem kept coming.

It forked at the tip, two tiny leaves unfurling as if tasting air. It moved with slow, curious intent, like a blind insect.

Josh’s eyes—those berry-red irises—rolled toward me.

I will never forget the look on his face. Not terror, exactly. Not pain, though there was plenty of that. It was confusion, the pure shock of betrayal by your own body. Like he couldn’t find the rules anymore.
I moved without thinking. I grabbed a dish towel and yanked.

The stem resisted, anchored somewhere deep in his throat. When I pulled harder, Josh gagged, and the stem slid out another inch—then two—accompanied by a wet sound that made my stomach flip.

There was no end to it.

The towel grew slick with spit and blood and a juice that stained it dark red.

Courtney screamed and her phone clattered to the floor and kept filming, the camera pointing at the ceiling, capturing only sound and the swinging light fixture.

Henry bolted from the table, sobbing, and ran upstairs.

Josh’s hands fluttered toward my wrists as if to stop me, then dropped. His body convulsed. His chest heaved like something inside was trying to breathe through him.

His skin, along his neck and collarbone, began to bulge in small moving lumps, traveling upward like roots searching for sunlight.

“Abbie—” he tried to say, but his voice came out as a rasp, shredded by leaves.

And then—God, I don’t even know how to write this—his teeth began to loosen.

Not all at once. One, then another, wiggling like baby teeth. His gums darkened, turning the color of the berries. When he coughed, a tooth popped free and bounced on the tile.

His mouth filled with something green.
I let go of the stem and stumbled backward, hitting the fridge.

Josh collapsed to his knees, hands clawing at his own throat. The bulges under his skin pushed and rearranged, shaping him from the inside, making the outline of his jaw wrong, too angular, too… wooden.
His eyes fixed on me.

And for a second, through all of it, I saw Josh. My Josh. My husband who always warmed his hands on the mug before he drank. My husband who cried when Henry was born even though he swore he wouldn’t. My husband who thought he was invincible.
His lips trembled, and I thought he was going to beg for me.

Instead, he smiled.

The stem between his lips blossomed.

Tiny, perfect leaves unfurled right there in his mouth like a bouquet being offered.

A new sound filled the kitchen—soft, rhythmic.
Not his breathing.

Not the kids crying.

A slow thump… thump… thump that seemed to come from the walls.

From the floor.

From the direction of the garden.

Josh’s chest rose, but not with air. With pressure, like something was inflating him. His ribs expanded outward, skin stretching tight. Underneath, the lumps moved in coordinated waves.

Then his sternum split.

I don’t mean metaphorically. I mean his chest opened with a wet crack, like a melon splitting under a knife. Blood sprayed, hot and bright, across the cabinets and my face, speckling my lips with iron.

Inside him was not a heart.

Inside him was a cluster of pale roots twisted around something dark and pulsing.

A berry cluster.

Nestled in his ribcage like it belonged there.

Josh’s mouth opened wider than it should have. The corners tore. The stem and leaves pushed out, and behind them, a thick vine forced its way up, slick with gore, dragging pieces of tissue with it like decorations.

It wrapped around the countertop, then the chair, then my wrist.

It was warm.

It tightened, gentle at first, almost affectionate. Like a hand.

I screamed and yanked away. The vine snapped back and slapped the floor, leaving a smear of blood that looked like a brushstroke.

Josh—whatever Josh was—tilted his head toward the back door. Toward the garden. Toward the bush.

And I understood, with awful clarity, that it wasn’t just growing in my yard.

It was growing through my home.

Courtney was shouting my name from somewhere behind me, but her voice sounded far away, muffled, like I was underwater. The thumping grew louder, synced now with the way the vine inside Josh pulsed.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

Like a heartbeat.

Like the garden from my dream.

I ran upstairs to Henry. I found him in his room, hiding in the closet with his cool rocks clutched to his chest like they could protect him. His face was wet and red.
“Mom?” he whispered. “Is Dad—”

“We’re leaving,” I said. I scooped him up, even though he’s too big now, even though my arms shook. “Get Courtney, and your shoes. Now.”

We flew down the stairs.

The kitchen was… changed.

The vine had spread. It crawled along the cabinets, over the sink, across the tile in branching tendrils. Leaves sprouted wherever it touched, unfurling fast like time-lapse footage. The air was thick with that warm-sweet rot smell, the kind of smell that tells you something has died and is being repurposed.

Josh’s body was slumped against the counter like a discarded husk. His chest was open. The berry cluster inside him pulsed wetly, glossy as an organ.
But his face—His face was turning gray. Not dead-gray. Bark-gray. The skin at his temples cracked in thin lines.

His mouth still smiled.

Courtney was at the base of the stairs, shaking, eyes wide, phone forgotten. “Mom,” she said, voice breaking. “It’s in the hallway.”

She wasn’t wrong.

A vine was creeping along the baseboard, slow but determined, like it had all the time in the world. It brushed the family photos on the wall and left behind a stain the color of wine.

The front door was right there.

We could’ve made it.

We should’ve made it.

And then Henry started coughing.

One small cough. Then another.

Wet.

He clapped his hands over his mouth, eyes huge.
When he pulled them away, there was something green on his palm.

A leaf fragment.

My mind did that horrible thing where it tries to deny what it’s seeing by finding a technicality. He probably breathed it in. He was in the garden yesterday. He was…

Then I looked at his eyes.

Still brown. Still Henry.

But the whites had tiny red threads in them, delicate as the veins in leaves.

Courtney made a sound like she’d been punched.

I grabbed both kids and shoved them toward the front door. My fingers fumbled with the lock. The vine in the hallway twitched like it noticed us.

The thumping came again, louder, and this time the walls seemed to respond.

The house creaked.

Not like settling. Like stretching.

The doorknob turned easily and the door swung open.

on the porch, in the space where our welcome mat should’ve been, there was a patch of soil.

Freshly turned and damp.

And from it—already pushing up, already unfurling glossy lacquered leaves—was a small, thorny shoot.
A berry bush. New, perfect, like a seedling speed-running its way into existence.

Courtney started sobbing.

Henry coughed again, and this time, the leaf fragment wasn’t a fragment. It was a small leaf, whole, trembling like it wanted to clap.

I slammed the door shut and leaned my back against it, heart hammering.

The vine in the hallway began to move faster, as if encouraged.

Somewhere behind us, in the kitchen, the berry cluster inside my husband’s broken chest pulsed in time with the thumping of my walls.

And from the garden, through the glass of the back door, I could see the original bush trembling—shivering in a wind that didn’t exist—berries swelling, darkening, ripening as if fed by something inside the house.

My house.

My family.

I don’t know if it was ever my garden.

I’m writing this from the upstairs bathroom with Henry and Courtney wedged beside me, knees to chest, the door locked even though I can already see thin green tendrils slipping under the crack like curious fingers.

Henry’s coughing has stopped for now. He keeps swallowing hard like his throat is itchy.

Courtney keeps whispering that she can hear Dad calling her name.

I can hear something too.

A sound from the walls. A slow, wet shifting, like roots rubbing against wood.

And beneath it all, constant now, patient as a clock:
Thump… thump… thump.

Tiny, perfect leaves unfurled right there in his mouth like a bouquet being offered.

A new sound filled the kitchen—soft, rhythmic.
Not his breathing.

Not the kids crying.

A slow thump… thump… thump that seemed to come from the walls.

From the floor.

From the direction of the garden.

Josh’s chest rose, but not with air. With pressure, like something was inflating him. His ribs expanded outward, skin stretching tight. Underneath, the lumps moved in coordinated waves.

Then his sternum split.

I don’t mean metaphorically. I mean his chest opened with a wet crack, like a melon splitting under a knife. Blood sprayed, hot and bright, across the cabinets and my face, speckling my lips with iron.

Nestled in his ribcage like it belonged there.

The air was thick with that warm-sweet rot smell, the kind of smell that tells you something has died and is being repurposed.

Josh’s body was slumped against the counter like a discarded husk. His chest was open. The berry cluster inside him pulsed wetly, glossy as an organ.
But his face—His face was turning gray. Not dead-gray. Bark-gray. The skin at his temples cracked in thin lines.

His mouth still smiled.

Courtney was at the base of the stairs, shaking, eyes wide, phone forgotten. “Mom,” she said, voice breaking. “It’s in the hallway.”

She wasn’t wrong.

A vine was creeping along the baseboard, slow but determined, like it had all the time in the world. It brushed the family photos on the wall and left behind a stain the color of wine.

The front door was right there.

We could’ve made it.

We should’ve made it.

And then Henry started coughing.

One small cough. Then another.

Wet.

He clapped his hands over his mouth, eyes huge.
When he pulled them away, there was something green on his palm.

A leaf fragment.

My mind did that horrible thing where it tries to deny what it’s seeing by finding a technicality. He probably breathed it in. He was in the garden yesterday. He was…

Then I looked at his eyes.

Still brown. Still Henry.

But the whites had tiny red threads in them, delicate as the veins in leaves.

Courtney made a sound like she’d been punched.

I grabbed both kids and shoved them toward the front door. My fingers fumbled with the lock. The vine in the hallway twitched like it noticed us.

The thumping came again, louder, and this time the walls seemed to respond.

The house creaked.

Not like settling. Like stretching.

The doorknob turned easily and the door swung open.

on the porch, in the space where our welcome mat should’ve been, there was a patch of soil.

Freshly turned and damp.

And from it—already pushing up, already unfurling glossy lacquered leaves—was a small, thorny shoot.
A berry bush. New, perfect, like a seedling speed-running its way into existence.

Courtney started sobbing.

Henry coughed again, and this time, the leaf fragment wasn’t a fragment. It was a small leaf, whole, trembling like it wanted to clap.

I slammed the door shut and leaned my back against it, heart hammering.

The vine in the hallway began to move faster, as if encouraged.

Somewhere behind us, in the kitchen, the berry cluster inside my husband’s broken chest pulsed in time with the thumping of my walls.

And from the garden, through the glass of the back door, I could see the original bush trembling—shivering in a wind that didn’t exist—berries swelling, darkening, ripening as if fed by something inside the house.

My house.

My family.

I don’t know if it was ever my garden.

I’m writing this from the upstairs bathroom with Henry and Courtney wedged beside me, knees to chest, the door locked even though I can already see thin green tendrils slipping under the crack like curious fingers.

Henry’s coughing has stopped for now. He keeps swallowing hard like his throat is itchy.

Courtney keeps whispering that she can hear Dad calling her name.

I can hear something too.

A sound from the walls. A slow, wet shifting, like roots rubbing against wood.

And beneath it all, constant now, patient as a clock:
Thump… thump… thump.

[**AI Commodities Analyst**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/commodities-analyst) delivers institutional-grade market intelligence across energy, metals, and agricultural commodities in seconds. While traditional commodity research requires piecing together data from dozens of sources—EIA reports, USDA WASDE releases, CFTC positioning data, and macro indicators—this AI synthesizes everything into unified, actionable analysis.

✅ Real-time supply/demand fundamental analysis  
  
✅ COT positioning and market structure insights  
  
✅ Macro context integration (dollar, rates, China demand)  
  
✅ Technical levels with invalidation conditions  
  
✅ Seasonal pattern awareness across all commodity sectors

With global commodity markets entering 2026 at a critical inflection point—[energy prices projected to fall 10%](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/developmenttalk/the-commodity-markets-outlook-in-eight-charts2), gold targeting [$4,500-$4,900](https://www.investing.com/analysis/golds-2026-outlook-scenarios-breakout-zones-that-could-trigger-next-major-move-200672438), and copper facing [structural deficits](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/commodities/copper-outlook)—investors need comprehensive analysis that connects the dots across fundamentals, positioning, and macro forces.

# Quick Answer: What Is AI Commodities Analyst?

[**AI Commodities Analyst**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/commodities-analyst) **is an institutional-grade research tool that synthesizes supply/demand fundamentals, technical analysis, positioning data, and macro context into unified commodity market intelligence.**

Unlike fragmented research that separates fundamental and technical analysis, this AI integrates all dimensions—from EIA inventory reports and USDA WASDE data to CFTC COT positioning and dollar/rates correlations—delivering the comprehensive view that professional trading desks use.

**Key capabilities:**

* Comprehensive energy analysis (crude oil, natural gas, refined products)
* Precious and industrial metals coverage (gold, silver, copper, aluminum)
* Agricultural market intelligence (grains, softs, livestock)
* Real-time positioning and market structure assessment
* Macro environment integration and seasonal pattern awareness

# The Problem: Commodity Analysis Is Fragmented and Time-Intensive

Commodity markets are uniquely complex. Unlike equities, where earnings and cash flow dominate, commodities require tracking physical supply/demand balances, inventory levels, production disruptions, weather patterns, geopolitical developments, and positioning data—simultaneously.

>

# Data Overload Without Synthesis

Commodity investors face a fragmented research landscape:

* **Energy:** EIA weekly petroleum status, natural gas storage reports, OPEC+ production decisions, refinery utilization data
* **Metals:** LME warehouse stocks, COMEX positioning, central bank gold purchases, China PMI data
* **Agriculture:** USDA WASDE reports, crop progress updates, export sales, weather forecasts across multiple growing regions
* **Positioning:** Weekly CFTC COT reports requiring interpretation of commercial vs. speculative positioning

Each data source provides a piece of the puzzle, but synthesizing them into actionable intelligence requires expertise most investors lack.

# Timing Sensitivity Creates Urgency

Commodity markets move on scheduled data releases with predictable timing:

|Day|Report|Commodities Affected|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Wednesday 10:30 ET|EIA Petroleum Status|Crude oil, gasoline, distillates|
|Thursday 10:30 ET|Natural Gas Storage|Natural gas|
|Friday 3:30 ET|COT Report|All futures markets|
|Monthly (varies)|WASDE Report|Grains, oilseeds, livestock|

Missing the context around these releases—or misinterpreting positioning data—can mean entering crowded trades at exactly the wrong time.

# Macro Context Often Ignored

>

Most commodity analysis treats each market in isolation. But commodities don't exist in a vacuum:

* **Dollar strength/weakness** affects all USD-priced commodities
* **Real interest rates** drive gold's opportunity cost
* **China's economic trajectory** determines marginal demand for industrial metals
* **Global growth expectations** shape energy consumption forecasts

Without integrating macro context, even accurate fundamental analysis can lead to poorly-timed decisions.

# The Solution: Unified Commodity Intelligence in Seconds

[**AI Commodities Analyst**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/commodities-analyst) eliminates the fragmentation problem by synthesizing all relevant data streams into cohesive, actionable analysis. The approach mirrors professional commodity trading desks while remaining accessible to individual investors.



|Traditional Approach|AI Commodities Analyst|
|:-|:-|
|Hours gathering data from multiple sources|Instant synthesis of EIA, USDA, CFTC, and macro data|
|Separate fundamental and technical analysis|Integrated view connecting supply/demand with price levels|
|Positioning data requires manual interpretation|COT analysis with crowded trade identification|
|Macro context often overlooked|Dollar, rates, and China demand automatically incorporated|
|Seasonal patterns require historical research|Built-in seasonal awareness across all commodity sectors|

# Institutional-Grade Fundamental Framework

The AI applies a rigorous supply/demand framework specific to each commodity category:

**Energy (Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Refined Products):**

* Inventory tracking via EIA Weekly Petroleum Status
* Production monitoring including U.S. shale output and OPEC+ quotas
* Demand indicators: refinery utilization, implied demand, seasonal patterns
* Spread analysis: crack spreads, calendar spreads, Brent-WTI differential

**Precious Metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium):**

* Macro drivers: real interest rates, dollar strength, inflation expectations
* Investment flows: ETF holdings, central bank buying/selling
* Physical demand: jewelry (India, China), industrial applications

**Industrial Metals (Copper, Aluminum, Zinc, Nickel):**

* Inventory levels: LME warehouse stocks, SHFE stocks
* China demand indicators: PMI data, property sector activity
* Supply disruption monitoring: mine outages, smelter curtailments

**Agriculture (Grains, Softs, Livestock):**

* USDA data integration: WASDE, crop progress, export sales
* Weather impact assessment across key growing regions
* Stocks-to-use ratio analysis for supply tightness signals

# Market Structure and Positioning Analysis

Understanding *who* is positioned *where* separates professional analysis from amateur guesswork:

>

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/commodities-analyst) interprets CFTC Commitments of Traders data to identify:

* **Extreme speculative positioning** signaling potential long liquidation or short squeeze risk
* **Commercial positioning divergence** from price as potential inflection signals
* **Contango vs. backwardation** indicating storage costs or supply tightness
* **Open interest trends** confirming or questioning price moves

# How It Works: From Question to Actionable Intelligence

Using [AI Commodities Analyst](https://www.jenova.ai/a/commodities-analyst) requires no specialized knowledge of data sources or analytical frameworks. Simply ask your question in natural language.

**Step 1: Ask Your Question**

Query the AI with any commodity-related question:

* ""What's the outlook for crude oil heading into Q1 2026?""
* ""Is gold positioning getting crowded?""
* ""How does the corn supply/demand balance look after the December WASDE?""
* ""What's driving copper prices and where are the key levels?""

**Step 2: Receive Integrated Analysis**

The AI automatically:

* Searches relevant official data sources (EIA, USDA, CFTC, LME)
* Incorporates current positioning context
* Considers macro environment (dollar, rates, growth expectations)
* Notes seasonal patterns applicable to the timeframe
* Identifies upcoming catalysts and data releases

**Step 3: Get Actionable Synthesis**

Every analysis concludes with clear implications:

* Directional view supported by confluence of signals
* Key price levels for support and resistance
* Catalysts that could confirm or invalidate the thesis
* Explicit timeframe applicability (near-term, medium-term, long-term)

**Step 4: Export and Track**

Generate PDF reports, export key levels to CSV, or set calendar reminders for upcoming data releases—all within the same conversation.

# 2026 Market Context: Why Comprehensive Analysis Matters Now

The commodity landscape entering 2026 presents exceptional complexity, making integrated analysis more valuable than ever.

# 📊 Energy: Supply Surplus Meets Geopolitical Risk

>

Energy markets face a bearish fundamental backdrop:

* OPEC+ rapidly ramping output as policy shifts
* Non-OPEC supply growing [three times faster than demand](https://www.ig.com/en/news-and-trade-ideas/commodities-market-outlook-for-2026-251212)
* Global oil market projected to be in large surplus

Yet geopolitical risks—from Middle East tensions to Russia-Ukraine developments—could trigger sharp volatility. [AI Commodities Analyst](https://www.jenova.ai/a/commodities-analyst) tracks both the fundamental surplus and the risk premium, helping investors navigate the tension.

# 💰 Precious Metals: Structural Demand Meets Rate Uncertainty

Gold delivered a [striking rally of more than 70% in 2025](https://www.investing.com/analysis/golds-2026-outlook-scenarios-breakout-zones-that-could-trigger-next-major-move-200672438), far exceeding the 27% gain recorded in 2024. The drivers remain intact:

* **Central bank demand:** Record purchases as countries diversify reserves
* **Real rate trajectory:** Fed policy expectations favor lower opportunity costs
* **Dollar weakness:** Structural support for USD-priced commodities
* **Geopolitical hedging:** Persistent uncertainty driving safe-haven flows

Major banks forecast gold in the [$4,500-$4,700 range for 2026](https://www.ig.com/en/news-and-trade-ideas/commodities-market-outlook-for-2026-251212), with upside toward $5,000 if macro conditions persist. Silver, after breaking above $55, has entered [price-discovery territory](https://www.ig.com/en/news-and-trade-ideas/commodities-market-outlook-for-2026-251212) with targets beyond $65.

# 🔧 Industrial Metals: Tight Supply Meets Demand Uncertainty

Copper presents the most complex setup:

>

Key dynamics:

* Year-long disruptions at Grasberg, Kamoa-Kakula, and El Teniente
* [730,000-830,000 tonnes of ""economically trapped"" copper in US warehouses](https://www.mining.com/coppers-tight-supply-and-tariff-risks-set-for-a-volatile-2026/) ahead of potential tariffs
* AI and data center demand adding [\~110 kmt of incremental demand in 2026](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/commodities/copper-outlook)
* Chinese demand softening as stimulus effects wane

# 🌾 Agriculture: Stabilization After Volatility

The [December 2025 USDA WASDE report](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde1225.pdf) showed:

* Bullish corn outlook with raised exports to record 3.2 billion bushels
* Neutral soybean projections with unchanged supply/use estimates
* Ample global grain supplies keeping prices relatively stable

Agricultural markets have entered a period of relative stability after early-2020s volatility, though coffee prices spiked on weather concerns and trade tensions remain a wildcard.

1q1o91c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1o91c,How I would remake Friday the 13th,"This is the first part of a new series of posts I'm going to do over in r/slasherfilms . In the comment section of one of my posts someone started talking about remakes and how some of them are good but most of them are pointless and didn't need to happen. And the conversation led to me mentioning that I could start a series of posts talking about how I would do remakes if I had the opportunities and that's exactly what I'm doing this is the first part. Because it's about Friday the 13th I decided to post it here in r/fridaythe13th as well as r/slasherfilms. But the rest of these posts are only going to be on r/slasherfilms so if you want to keep up with this series keep up with my post over there if you can.

How I would remake Friday the 13th? Well if it's an actual remake and not a reboot or reimagining then it's going to have to be Pamela as the Killer not Jason. Now I love Friday the 13th all the movies. And although I can admit they're not perfect I still love them so I still love Friday the 13th Part 1 but if the whole point of a remake is to do it better or at least try to do it better here's how I would do it better.

The whole movie Is framed as a who done it Mystery They never reveal the killer Until the end That's not how who done its are supposed to work. So you could say Friday the 13th Part 1 as a whodunit movie is terrible in that regard. So how I would do it instead of having Pamela show up at the end she's going to be there from the get-go working as the cook either they will only call her the Cook or just call her Pam instead of Pamela and they will never mention the last name Voorhees throughout the whole movie until near the end when she reveals that she is Jason's mother. Or option number two she takes on a fake name when she gets rehired on so they don't know that she's Mrs Voorhees until she reveals it. Although if she knew the Christie's back in the day they would see right through that so either for this new film continuity it's new people trying to reopen the camp instead of the original owners or I just won't use the change my name option.

Next is how we deal with Jason in the movie. In the original film they never intended for him to actually secretly still be alive so in the second film when they imply he never drowned or somehow came back from the dead and saw his mom killed that night it feels like an ass pull. So how about during the final scene when she's about to get her head cut off we actually do see Jason in the background watching from just far enough away that he's too far away to stop it before it happens and obscured enough to wear you won't see him at first you may have to brighten up the film to see him. And we will have a scene where the investigators get Pamela's body but her head is missing implying Jason took it. We can still have the jump scare Jason dream sequence at the end but it'll be clear that it's just a hallucination or dream because we will see adult Jason taking his mom's head. And this last part is optional but I think the opening of part 2 should be like a after credit scene at the end of part one where he kills Alice.

Lastly miscellaneous things that could be changed. Some shots and scenes go on longer than necessary such as the making coffee scene near the end we don't need to see every step of that. So anything that feels like it's dragging trim it down and either don't have a snake killing scene or use a fake snake that was messed up what they did. And lastly either don't have stuff like the Native American headdress scene from the original which would be considered offensive nowadays but the movie was made in the 80s so it was a different time. Either have it take place in modern day which feels wrong I feel like that movie should always take place in 1980 or 1979. Or have it still take place in 1980 but just don't have offensive stuff there. Or last option have a disclaimer that says this film takes place in this time period this stuff was normal back then don't get offended.

And that's how I would remake Friday the 13th. What do y'all think? What do y'all think about remakes in general and what do y'all think about this idea for a possible Friday the 13th remake?",2,1767325680.0,slasherfilms,3,1.0,False

1q1o5nf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1o5nf,How I would remake Friday the 13th.,"This is the first part of a new series of posts I'm going to do over in r/slasherfilms . In the comment section of one of my posts someone started talking about remakes and how some of them are good but most of them are pointless and didn't need to happen. And the conversation led to me mentioning that I could start a series of posts talking about how I would do remakes if I had the opportunities and that's exactly what I'm doing this is the first part. Because it's about Friday the 13th I decided to post it here in r/fridaythe13th as well as r/slasherfilms. But the rest of these posts are only going to be on r/slasherfilms so if you want to keep up with this series keep up with my post over there if you can.

How I would remake Friday the 13th? Well if it's an actual remake and not a reboot or reimagining then it's going to have to be Pamela as the Killer not Jason. Now I love Friday the 13th all the movies. And although I can admit they're not perfect I still love them so I still love Friday the 13th Part 1 but if the whole point of a remake is to do it better or at least try to do it better here's how I would do it better.

The whole movie Is framed as a who done it Mystery They never reveal the killer Until the end That's not how who done its are supposed to work. So you could say Friday the 13th Part 1 as a whodunit movie is terrible in that regard. So how I would do it instead of having Pamela show up at the end she's going to be there from the get-go working as the cook either they will only call her the Cook or just call her Pam instead of Pamela and they will never mention the last name Voorhees throughout the whole movie until near the end when she reveals that she is Jason's mother. Or option number two she takes on a fake name when she gets rehired on so they don't know that she's Mrs Voorhees until she reveals it. Although if she knew the Christie's back in the day they would see right through that so either for this new film continuity it's new people trying to reopen the camp instead of the original owners or I just won't use the change my name option.

Next is how we deal with Jason in the movie. In the original film they never intended for him to actually secretly still be alive so in the second film when they imply he never drowned or somehow came back from the dead and saw his mom killed that night it feels like an ass pull. So how about during the final scene when she's about to get her head cut off we actually do see Jason in the background watching from just far enough away that he's too far away to stop it before it happens and obscured enough to wear you won't see him at first you may have to brighten up the film to see him. And we will have a scene where the investigators get Pamela's body but her head is missing implying Jason took it. We can still have the jump scare Jason dream sequence at the end but it'll be clear that it's just a hallucination or dream because we will see adult Jason taking his mom's head. And this last part is optional but I think the opening of part 2 should be like a after credit scene at the end of part one where he kills Alice.

Lastly miscellaneous things that could be changed. Some shots and scenes go on longer than necessary such as the making coffee scene near the end we don't need to see every step of that. So anything that feels like it's dragging trim it down and either don't have a snake killing scene or use a fake snake that was messed up what they did. And lastly either don't have stuff like the Native American headdress scene from the original which would be considered offensive nowadays but the movie was made in the 80s so it was a different time. Either have it take place in modern day which feels wrong I feel like that movie should always take place in 1980 or 1979. Or have it still take place in 1980 but just don't have offensive stuff there. Or last option have a disclaimer that says this film takes place in this time period this stuff was normal back then don't get offended.

And that's how I would remake Friday the 13th. What do y'all think? What do y'all think about remakes in general and what do y'all think about this idea for a possible Friday the 13th remake?",3,1767325415.0,fridaythe13th,0,1.0,False

My mother and older sister have battled anorexia my whole life. I’m 30 now, working, “adulting” in a fairly normal capacity…I gained quite a bit of weight following a car accident in 2021 and lost a ton in the last year. I’m quite possibly thinner than I was through college, etc. I know I don’t have a “normal” relationship with food, I have a high demand job and I drink coffee with only a bit of creamer in it ALL day (lots of caffeine) and I will count or restrict on what I eat for dinner (it’s the only meal). However, on holidays or when socializing, etc. If I’m out or at events I will eat what others are eating, and if I want something I have it (granted I feel guilt for it later). But in talking to my friend and complaining about feeling fat or gross or hating that I have no self control or I’m weak when I do eat and don’t count or pay attention, she mentions that she thinks I have an ED. My question is, how did you know? On some level my mind is at the “I’m a rational adult” phase of “if I’m aware that my habits are not exactly normal” and I don’t full on restrict like a teenager refusing to eat food their parents put in front of them, and I’ve never “needed” a program or anything, how can it be an ED?

1q1o2j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1q1o2j0/im_new_here_please_bear_with_me/,"I’m new here, please bear with me.","3 month or so lurker, a bit new to this - let me explain. 

In 2018 I was diagnosed with a meningioma in the back of my head (left side) near base. The tumor ended up being just short of a cutie tangerine. 

I had the tumor removed and went back to work exactly 4 weeks post surgery. Something I’m proud of. After surgery I did 6 weeks of radiation. Tumor free after the clean up radiation. 

About 3 years post surgery I had my first aura. At the time I had no idea what the F it was. I would have them and they would leave me with awful headaches. Sometimes for days and I was diagnosed with migraines. 

Spent a few years chasing the migraine train and would commonly have 2 aura episodes in Fall and Spring each year since. 

Each time I’d have my aura episode - I eventually learned that if I treated it with migraine medicine and immediately laying down and shutting eyes for a few hours I’d sorta beat them (sometimes). 

Then there would be the bad times. Most times I wouldn’t beat them. I’d be left with headaches for days and I’d need a migraine cocktail that would break up my headaches - but I’d be left with one thing. I couldn’t read. 

I’d be left without the ability to read or understand works being read. It would usually last about 2 weeks. I’d wake up each day and grab the remote to turn the TV on hoping I could read the news. It was the grossest feeling. 

This past Feb I had another incident of Aura. This time they came and went for days. Each time with a headache. Since I was becoming less responsive my wife took me to the ER. 

At the ER, I had a seizure. The first that we are aware of. They admitted me and hooked me up to brain scan machines for days. I had a few more seizures while in hospital. 

I was paired with a great neurologist that diagnosed my seizures and put me on lacsomide (100/100) and I had felt great up until 12/2. On 12/2 I was just making coffee like I do every day and I had an Aura. 

No one was home so called wife with Siri and my FIL came over to fine me unresponsive and called 911. He witnessed seizure and I went to ER. They let me go about 90 minutes later. 

I’ve since been moved to 100/150 and there was a bit of adjustment for me. I’m feeling pretty good now. What I’m trying to figure out is what is my trigger?  Will I ever be seizure free?  Have others had a history like me and have gone seizure free?  

My last episode left me with near crippling anxiety afterward. Just waiting for the next one.

I’m wondering if it would be appropriate to ask more firmly to be paid back, or if I should continue to be quiet about it or even just forget about it and move on with life. 

Back in september he needed his oil changed, I offered to change it for him that upcoming weekend when I had the time, but he was leaving out of town the next day and wanted to have it done that day so he didn’t burn his oil on the drive. He needed the money for the oil change, so I gave him the hundred, and he said “I promise I’ll pay you back.” and thanked me for saving his ass. When our friend group has outings that require tickets, I’ll usually get them all, and then have everyone pay me back. That way we can all sit together, and I give them until the time of the event to pay me back for it. We’ve been to 2 concerts as a group, and I haven’t been paid for those tickets. Everyone else didn’t have a problem with it though. He felt bad he didn’t have the money at the time, but I didn’t want the ticket to go to waste, nor did I want him to feel excluded so I told him it was fine to come anyway, just pay me back. We have another group event coming up. I’ve received everyone’s payment in a timely manner, except for his. We’re at the point now where he owes me a solid 450 dollars. This may seem small to some, or large to some. We’re both college students, so I imagine some of you know what the college kid budget was like. I’ve done things like buy coffee or lunch, and i’m someone where i don’t worry about that too much. But he made a comment today on how he felt bad for me buying coffee, because he knew he still owed me money. 

So at what point do I ask for it back? Or do I just assume I’m not getting it, cut my losses and move on. If i’m asking for it back, I’m struggling with how to ask. I don’t want to seem rude or self centered, but I also can’t keep doing this either.

I decided to indulge for the holidays knowing it would be my last chance for a while. That's when I got pregnant.,"This is all very, very anecdotal but I wanted to share. I will post my full story soon along with updates.

Like it says in the title, in 2025 I did everything I could to be healthy to conceive. It was going to be my last try before getting assistance be that medicated, IUI, IVF, whatever.

I was diligent with vitamins and supplements, I was getting proper nutrition always and lost weight, I stayed away from caffeine and alcohol, everything they tell you to do when you're trying to conceive with endo. The plan was if this didn't work then I would procure better, more expensive insurance and begin fertility treatments in 2026. At this point I have been trying to conceive every cycle for 3 years with one ectopic pregnancy about 6 months in.

So December 2025 is here and no luck still. My partner and I are taking time off for the holidays so I decide during that two-week break I'm going to let loose and consume whatever I want.

I ovulated December 17, vacation began December 19 (sex on -3 & 0 DPO). I stopped taking my supplements - partly laziness and partly because they don't go well with alcohol - and I binge drank at least five times and had drinks almost every day. Smoked weed all the time drank lots of coffee, ate like crap, basically no exercise, you get it.

NYE came yesterday and I feel hungover as expected. I always feel like shit anyway, especially in the mornings. My period was one day late which isn't unusual, but I've also been cramping for days very much expecting blood each time but never seeing any. I figure I better take a test and move on with my life when it's negative, as usual.

Nope, solid positive. Much darker today and way darker than the ectopic was at this point.

Time will tell what actually happens here but come on life, wtf? Fertility is so hard for me because it's so insanely unpredictable and uncontrollable. Work hard at something for years and when you don't try it happens. I'm glad (and nervous) but fuck. I'm sure being healthy this year didn't hurt but I firmly believe it's mostly just luck.",4,1767324903.0,TTCEndo,1,1.0,False
1q1nzeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1q1nzeg/help_with_navigating_a_return_home/,Help with navigating a return home,"Re-posting with more details. 

I left my husband two months ago for what was supposed to be a one month break. I extended it to 2 months, and I was supposed to go home Monday. But I just extended it to 3 months because I felt nervous about coming home. I don’t feel ready for it. I thought we could start slow with coffee dates or something. I was going to stay away but he offered to leave and let me move back home. 

The break was because he got violent a few times. He stopped being violent but I got into hypervigilence where I was always scanning his moods. His anger really scares me or if I don’t know what mood he’s in. I couldn’t sleep, eat, or barely function. I’m pregnant and I want baby to be healthy. So I left.

The break was for him to take anger management and me individual therapy. I thought it will make the hypervigilence go away. But I still feel anxious and I want him to be in therapy a little longer before I go home.

I’ve been across the country and I’m flying back home on Monday. My husband is supposed to leave the house so I can move back in. We have been keeping in touch by phone and text. But ever since I extended the break again, he hasn’t been responding to my texts. He did it last week after my nephew died and I texted him the obituary. When he didn’t respond, I was panicking started spiralling until I ended up calling him. He acted like nothing is wrong.

Now he’s doing it again and I feel like he’s trying to manipulate me. I texted him happy new year 10.5 hrs ago and he hasn’t responded. He usually responds to my texts right away. I have been spiralling. I wonder if he’s doing it on purpose. Because last time he didn’t answer me, I called him. And also told him I’m having second thoughts about the additional month break. So maybe this is to get me to call. He’s been looking at my Instagram stories so I know he’s ignoring me. 

I’m trying not to call him but it’s hard. I just want the tension to stop. I’ve been sleeping just to get through the pain. But when I wake up and check my texts and don’t see a response, It hurts. It feels intentional.

I have to fly home Monday. I’ve been couch surfing for months. I haven’t had any prenatal healthcare. Being away from home has also re-triggered an eating disorder. I’ve lost my autonomy and control. So I think I need to be in my home with my cats and my things.

I’m worried about Monday. Do I just not talk to him at all and just show up at home? He knows when my flight is coming so he should be gone. But there’s a chance he’s there - I told him the other day I was having second thoughts but it was a bad time for him to talk. But now I feel his anger from across the country and I’m worried about what he will do with that resentment. Even if things are good at first, it will come up eventually.

Entry 8 

August 31st. 

“Can you stop reading that GOD awful self-help book already!” The gambler blurted out, directed at the African American man. “I’m so tired of hearing about it all!” 

“Let me read in peace please” was his response.  

“Constant! Louder and louder! Your terrible books, the girl's stupid home, the woman's annoying family!” the gambler pointed a moving excusatory finger at each of them “I’ve had enough! And don’t even get me started on this senile old man, always thinking about the stupid fucking sunflowers!” His anger now directed at the most fragile one in the group. The Singaporean sat at the table, staring at nothing. Some more yelling was done before he struck the innocent man, nothing too harsh, just a smack behind the head. We called security to calm the situation down. 

This is how the conflicts began, or something like this anyway. The point is the old man shut down mentally and refused to speak. We did multiple checks on the man, and he was physically healthy, but something wasn’t right mentally. We couldn't get in contact with any of his family, so he stayed in our care. The gambler kept starting fights, nothing extreme, but eventually causing security to step in every now and then. The large dark man that once stood tall and confident had shrunk to a mouse that only read. The two women in the room were inseparable. They huddled together constantly and sometimes whispered reassurance to each other. Clearly these people were miserable, and the effects of whatever happened to them were causing complications. And yet they stayed. Some refused the idea of leaving, the gambler for one kept raving about getting his money, some just seemed to stay because the others did. We kept them there and watched them.  

The morale in the office wasn’t good. At work and in our quarters, we were often silent, lost in our work or our own thoughts. Sometimes me and Craig would confine in each other, questioning our life choices, sometimes laughing about it. I believe the girls did the same thing. Sometimes I’d talk to Gabriella. Sweet conversations about our innocent youths.  

“As I said, I was always a science nerd, so it makes sense I ended up in a place like this. But you? How does a sporty outdoors man like yourself wind up in this spot? I mean, what happened to all the camping and rock climbing you spoke so fondly of?” She asked with a giggle. That kind of positivity hadn’t been seen in these rooms for a long time. 

“Oh, come on. That was a lifetime ago.” I responded. 

“College was a lifetime ago? It feels like yesterday for me. How old are you Mr. Miller?”  

I was so caught up with her soft sweetness I had forgotten of our age gap. The realization admittedly shocked me; I paused while taking a sip of my coffee. 

“I’m sorry Mr. Miller, how rude of me.” She said, face blushed bright pink. 

“No, no. It’s alright. I’m 50.” If I had to say a guess of her age, I'd say Gabreilla was around early 30’s. If I was willing to admit I stalked her file, I’d say she was exactly 28 as of 5 months ago. Believe it or not watching crazy people all day every day gets boring so sometimes you gotta fill the gaps between disturbing incidents with finding out the details of your coworkers. Don't judge me. Anyway, after that the joyful conversation turned awkward, so she returned to her work, and I returned to my second cup of coffee. 

 To be honest, I think we were scared, although we didn’t admit it. Scared for these people and for ourselves. We would try to busy ourselves with work and idle conversation, but at one point or another we aways had to come back and address the elephant in the room. This is roughly when my nightmares started, so even in sleep, I could not rest. 

I would dream of them. They took me to a shore in the middle of the night, strange moons hung above. They were talking to me all at once, different things but occasionally their sentences would align in a few words or phrases. They blamed me. For their situations, before the experiment, and after. Somehow it was all my fault. They'd surround me and the noise would strain my ears even if I tried to cover them.  Eventually the stress and pressure would wake me up. We all had nightmares from time to time, us and the subjects. It was normal.

Entry 9 

I saw her outside my window two nights ago.  

I collapsed on the ground at who knows what time, not asleep but not awake. My knees just seemed to have given up just as much as I had. It’d be hypocritical of me to force them up and continue my binge drinking into the night. So, on the floor I stayed. Until a sobering knock had risen me from my state. Just one swift knock, not even at my door, I don’t know where it came from. I steadied myself, eyes darting around the dimly lit space, the air thick with the stench of alcohol. I stood in the center of my room and listened, liquid confidence preparing me to strike at anything, hands open and at the ready, like a drunken fool. The knock was sharp, deliberate, and it still echoed in my mind, as if it had come from all around me. I couldn’t place it. Not the door, not the walls - just the sound, lingering.  

My breath was slow and heavy as I slowly shambled to the window and peered through the blinds. On the second floor of my motel, I got a clear view of the cold street below, flickering with moths and broken streetlamps. Among the noisy visage of the night I noticed a static outline, barely visible through the blinking lamp above. I focused and strained until a figure emerged from this shape. Curves and long, dark hair. Another knock, its origin still in question, rattled throughout my room, making me flinch. Yet it could not drag my attention away from her for long. Across the street, almost entirely adjacent to my room, motionless, she stood. My gaze fixed on her, following the contour of her body, desperately attempting to define some detail. 

Suddenly another knock came and with it a snap of her neck as she tilted her head. She was looking directly at me. I didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. The streetlight flickered again, casting her face into brief, haunting clarity. Pale skin, dark eyes that seemed to pierce right through me, like she knew my every thought, every secret. It's Gabriella. There she was under the light of a streetlamp, her long brunette hair slouched down and covered some of her face, but I still knew it was her, unmistakably so.  

A coward I am, of course, I shut the blinds, slid down the wall and sat on my ass until it left, or I passed out. 

 

 

 

\*\*03/16/25\*\* 

Entry 10  

Around late September is when I no longer could consider them human.  

They’d often say things simultaneously which caused them to cut each other off and start and stop sentences. Any form of out loud communication was a frustrating mess. Until they stopped speaking all together. A confused chaos slowly dying down into silence. Silence for us, however, I’m sure the storm of voices continued beyond the veil of their minds. 

Their undesirable financial situations taken advantage of as we dangle a paycheck in front of them, just so we could do as we please to them, their bodies, and their minds. 

One day I just stared at them with pity and anxiety. As close to the window as I could get, I focused on these poor people and couldn’t help but think that they were eerie. The deepest point of the uncanny valley, the thalweg of it. “For some reason,” I thought. “Maybe it’s the look in their eyes, I don’t know, I just don't think they’re human anymore.” 

“But we are human.” They spoke in monotoned unison. Just as I processed what they had said, I noticed that they had all stopped and begun staring through the one-sided glass. No, not just past the glass, but at me. Each test subject was staring directly into my eyes! Panic and fear instantly formed within me. My palms moistened and I froze. As did the observing room.  Even more eyes had befallen upon me, I was surrounded by puzzled expressions. I was the center of everyone's attention. They answered me. 

“What was that about?” Craig directed his question at me. They looked over at Craig. Our microphone was certainly off, yet even if it was on that doesn’t explain how they answered me. This wasn’t right. I thought they were only supposed to connect with each other. I didn’t sign up for this. 

“Arthur?” Alexa was just as confused. I turned to them and refused to live in denial. 

“They read my thoughts.” I confessed. We could do nothing but write an incident report, continue our notes, and follow up with more tests. We tried to get them to do it again, but they were mostly unresponsive. 

It was around this time they started sleeping together. They pushed a few of their beds together and packed in like sardines. Soon to be like tuna. They sometimes kissed each other and murmured together. 

Days later, without further incident, I awoke from one of my usual nightmares. In the dead of night, I approached the monitoring system. Splayed out on a few monitors I watched them sleep. I wish I had just stayed in bed, at least then maybe I would've been able to sleep that night. They weren’t asleep, just pretending to be. Through the white noise of our speakers, barely picked up by the microphones in their room, the test subjects hummed together once again. 

“You harbor a great guilt, Mr. Miller.” 

I went to bed and begged and pleaded to some higher being that I could just fall asleep and forget all of this. Sleep did not come. 

The following day I buried these memories and tried to find solace in idle small talk about anything else. Craig somehow looked and acted even more like a corpse than before, Alexa made it very clear that she did not want to speak to me, so I approached Gabriella. She was deep in her notes once again. I’ve noticed Gabriella’s once pristine notes now lie in ruin. Barely legible chicken scratches cover the pages. Her beautiful hair is now tangled and knotted. She smells. As I greet her, she slams her book shut and nervously replies   

“M-Mr. Miller? Hello! Sorry I was just...” she was frazzled. Something was different about her, more than the obvious, something within. “Yesterday, they spoke to you... have you ever spoken back?” What could she possibly mean by this? The subjects, the look in her eyes, I wanted no part in it.   

“No.” is all I said, before leaving and getting back to work. 

All they do anymore is sit together, silent. They wear each other's clothes, sometimes they don't wear anything. They eat each other's food, occasionally “baby birding” food to each other, as Gabriella put it. Soon we will contact whoever is closest to these people and let them know that they will not be coming back. We inform subjects not to allow any of their points of contact to know what they are doing or why they are missing. If things go wrong, they’re death is made to look like an accident, they’re chosen points of contact get notified of this first. It's rare, but such cases do happen. This will be one such case. They knew what they were signing up for. They are beyond help. 

Looking at them makes my head hurt. 

 

\*\*03/19/25 - 0950\*\* 

Entry 11 ?

It was the 20\^(th) of November. 1832hrs. 

The Heartful crescendo of a symphony meant to grace the chests of those in need of their fight or flight instincts drummed through my body, circulating adrenaline to each end of my being. Caused by a site that no human has come across before. My gut retched as evil began to form before me. 

The test subjects curled forward and began screaming. It started as a slow groan but only continued to get louder and louder... 

 

\*The letter belonged to Gabriella; the cleanliness of her handwriting is unmistakable.  It’s a far cry from the mess of a page I’d last seen her scribble out. I finally had the courage to tear open and examine the innards of what had caused me so much anxiety and fear ever since I found it. It hurts my head to read. Flashes of everything come and go.

“What's the matter?! What do you feel?!” Craig barked at the microphone. Their only response was further agonizing screams. Slowly, they began to slug to each other, tearing off their clothes. Throats were audibly carving as their mournful wails slowly synchronized in dreadful harmony. They came together in a sweaty embrace. I could notice melting skin sticking and stretching out to hold the hands of the others, warmly longing and sinking into a sickening fusion. They broke their bones just to get closer, flesh tore, eyes popped and melted. Biting and clawing at each other, fingering and digging into their wounds. They spat and drooled and cried and bled. I don't know how, but they truly began to melt. A slow, horrific process where we could do nothing but observe. They pushed each other in, like clothes in an already full suitcase, any piece hanging out angrily shoved back in. By the time security showed up to try and pull them apart it seemed it was too late, the task impossible. Only Alexa had the confidence to lurch her food from her stomach onto the floor, the rest of us suspended in fear. The guards slowly backed away, looking to us for an explanation...

Eventually it seemed their enfoldment had ceased. They were molding each other into one; their skulls were formed atop one another unevenly, layered like conjoined quintuplets. The details of their faces were lost. Not a single eye survived the merge, yet each of their jaws did, although broken and shifted in wrong directions, their rows of fangs hiding behind one another, like a human shark. So large and dark and terrible, a night sky, each star a jutting tooth. Surrounding this void was what looked like an old, healed burn victim's skin, impossibly pale and desperately latching onto its now thickened cranium. There were two slits in the middle, a remnant, or perhaps an imitation, of a nose. It had no ears, at least none that would work. Some vague shapes of ears could be found around its head and neck, but they did not have any holes. Yet it still had some very small orifices scattered around its face. Maybe some sort of attempt at an evolutionary necessity to allow its skin to breathe. It had wet greasy strands of hair, although not many, as most were ripped out in clumps during their combination. If you look closely, you can tell that patches of flesh have molded over the top of a lot of their locks, like mounds of gum stuck on a woman's head. Its thick neck fumbled and folded into its enlarged body, which was thick, yellow, and mutilated, undulating and writhing, getting used to its new form. A fat mass of limbs of varying sizes. It had a main pair of arms and legs, the rest of their limbs were scattered and mostly engulfed. A finger here, a toe there, its left arm was a combination of two, seemingly the two younger males. A hand could be seen wrapped around its own neck, still twitching every now and then. Some hands and feet had extra digits, some had fewer. Some digits had nails, some didn’t, some had several. It sat there and breathed, chest heaving and falling, at first in jerks and spasm, but it soon found its rhythm...

\*I don’t even know who’s left. Fuck, for all I know there isn’t anyone who hasn’t been intertwined in that mental spider web. Knots and kinks and tangles of thoughts and people. It’s got Gabreilla, I know that much...\* 

 

 

 

Stillness and mouths agape on our side of the glass. As if Medusa herself had laid her wicked curse upon all that observed this horrific scene. The fear and confusion crippled us. Alexa cried in her puddle of vomit. At this instance I knew this was not the work of science nor any righteous god. Before we knew what to do with ourselves, it spoke. Through its terrible jaws and the flaws that come with a new body it found its voice, through wheezes into splatters into groans into words, words that clawed and shambled out of the deepest part of its gullet.  

“We. Are. one.” 

Lives upon lives, uprooted and entangled together creating a mind-numbing brew of consciousness. 

For a long time, it allowed us to study and contemplate what we would do next. Dozens of minutes of pointless deliberation until ultimately it decided it was done. We heard it again, but it did not speak. At first, it shared its pleasure and its understanding. It liked its news form. The presence of each other as one. They now knew themselves and were free from judgment. They had knowledge like no other, a swirling delicious concoction of bliss, and they gave us a taste. It was disgusting. Having this perverted creature wriggle its way into my mind. I felt violated. Next, it showed us the flaw of individuality. Our flaws... 

 

 

\*I don’t know what it wants. I don't know why it showed us those things. Maybe I’ll try to find out...\* 

 

 

We saw Gabriella Anderson, looking at Arthur. At night she would think about him privately. She would then cry after. 

We saw Alexa Petrov driving, drinking. She hit a man. No one knew. She saw the funeral from a distance. A father. 

Craig Boris, disdain, regret. Arguing with his wife, Mitchelle Geneviève. Loving his wife. He blamed himself for her passing. He never wanted to be a father, and he told her so. 

Arthur Miller, sleeping with Mitchelle Geneviève...

1q1npfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q1npfw/my_27f_unintentional_resentment_of_my_partner_27m/,"My (27F) unintentional resentment of my partner (27M) made him leave me, but what else am I missing?","Advice? Feedback? Words of encouragement? Please be kind, he only broke up with me 3 days ago :( 

TLDR: Together 3.5 years, very happy until we moved in together 1 year ago. After that our dynamic changed, he felt things were off, and he broke up with me 3 days ago. I realised I built resentment towards him from me doing most of the housework and mental load, which hurt my mood and our connection. He acknowledged this but thinks there are other issues too. I’m heartbroken, want another chance, and am trying to understand what else I might be missing (the issues he speaks of) and how to improve.

My (27F) partner (27M) and I were together for 3.5 years, living together for 13 months. Our relationship was fantastic the first 2.5 years before we moved in together. Before we moved in together we were seeing each other on the weekends and a couple of times throughout the week. We were in love and ridiculously in sync and in tune with each others thoughts, feelings, wants and needs. Our emotional and physical connection was great. Like most relationships, we had occasional little arguments, but ultimately it was a very happy and healthy relationship. I truly believe that he was (still is) my person. I couldn't imagine myself with anyone else. I love and care for him so much and he is my best friend. 

When we moved in together 13 months ago it was okay at first, but then the dynamic began to change. 

He has recently broken up with me (3 days ago) due to something along the lines of our relationship not being the same as it used to be, him feeling different and saying the relationship feels off to him and not right. I am to blame for this. I know that I am the one who has changed since we moved in together, though I didn't mean to. 

He first told me about his ""off"" feelings about 6 months ago and that he wanted a break. I begged him to stay (he did) and told him that I would try my best to work on myself and address my issues. 

Part of his feelings were to do with the fact that he felt like I was always mad or frustrated or unhappy with him (though I always reassured him that I was never mad at him and that I loved him). He also felt like I wasn't as interested (in him and having meaningful conversations with him) as I used to be. And I think he felt like my mood/vibe wasn't very good and that sometimes I was on my phone too much (contributing to the ""uninterested"" point). 

I agreed that my mood, which always used to be happy around him, had lowered. I felt more negative as a person in general. I do think that I spent time on my phone when I should have been connecting with him, however excluding weekends, night time during the week was usually the only time I had to catch up on socials, and it really helped me decompress after work. I think I did appear a bit uninterested when he was trying to talk to me when I was invested in scrolling, but in those moments I was just trying to relax after work. I never scrolled for THAT long and we would usually chat later and eat dinner together then watch something together. I didn't think just relaxing on the couch with my phone for an hour or so was that bad, and it's not like I didn't talk to him at all. He would show interest in me, but I cannot say that I felt a whole lot of loving from him myself whilst he was feeling this way about our relationship (understandably I guess). 

So anyway, I tried to work on myself. I made an effort to go on my phone less. I tried to stop nagging him as much about the house work (a big contribution to my mood/frustration). I tried to be more positive. I made an effort to have more meaningful conversations with him and show more interest in him, what he was doing, what he was watching, etc. We started date nights again for a little bit but it didn't last very long (always me having to organise it). I don't think much really changed (I wasn't actually very sure on what I needed to work on for myself or how) and I still didn't feel much loving from him (as he didn't from me I guess, even though I've never loved anyone so much in my life). 

About one month ago I came to the realisation that I had been resenting him, and I believe it is because ever since we moved in together, I was the one doing almost everything around the house. Is that a stupid? Please tell me if that is stupid. 

Before we lived together, I lived alone and he with other male friends. Their cleaning standards were beyond low. But perhaps mine were also just too high (my mum was a clean freak). Throughout the first half of living together I tried to ask him to help more around the house, as it naturally ended up falling on me. He would help when asked, but I had to specifically ask him to do each specific task, as he very rarely took initiative to see what needed to be done and just do it. Even though he would mostly do what I asked, I hated the fact that I always had to even ask him! It made me feel like a nagging bitch :( Why couldn't he just see that the shower had mould in it and clean it? Why couldn't he see the dirt on the floor and vacuum it? Why did I specifically have to say ""hey, you left coffee grounds all over the bench, can you please wipe it?"", otherwise it would never be wiped. 

I tried just doing things myself without asking him, but it felt so unfair. We both work full time and I would get home from work and have to prepare dinner, maybe do a load of washing etc. eat dinner, then still do personal things such as shower etc. before I could FINALLY relax after work (sometimes also trying to squeeze in some exercise too). I feel like by the time I had done everything that needed to be done, I'd only have a few hours to spend with him before I had to go to bed, which sucked (but is the reality I guess). I would often try to stay up late with him just to get as much time with him as I could, even though I had to get up at 6am the next day for work (we didn't see each other in the mornings on weekdays, as I got up before him) and was often tired. Whereas he would finish work (work from home 5 days a week mind you) and get to relax right after, often having a nap immediately after work. It made me feel really alone, unappreciated and overwhelmed that I would have to get home and do all these things mostly by myself (including carrying the mental load of it all) whilst he didn't, and I guess it eventually made me resentful of him, though I still loved him with all my heart. 

I suppose my moment of realisation (that I was resenting him because of this unfairness and that's what I think was contributing to my poor mood, constant frustration, stress etc.) came at the wrong time. I wanted to explore this ""issue"" I had discovered a bit more before speaking to him about it, but December is a busy time, and before I could fully comprehend my feelings and this realisation I had finally had to share it with him, he broke up with me because it wasn't working. 

He left to stay at his mum's. The following day he came over to get some things and we sat down and I told him all about my realisation and why I think I'm feeling and acting the way I am towards him. He was very receptive. He said that makes sense, and he apologised for not stepping up and helping me as much as he should have, especially with the invisible tasks that go unnoticed like planning, remembering and organising. He also said this isn't the only issue though - which I guess might be true, but I also feel like this has had a very significant impact on me and I really believe a lot of our other problems stem from this one (though he isn't so sure). 

I told him that it was difficult for me to relax and feel at peace in our shared space if it was messy or cluttered or the washing was piling up etc. (a me issue, I know). And that I thought the issues we were having (me being negative, a poor connection, etc.) were a symptom of this one much bigger issue (me feeling unsupported). I said how could I feel warm and playful and loving and affectionate towards him, like I used to before we lived together, when I felt like I was getting no support from him? I said as the resentment built, it became so hard for me to feel openly loving and light and upbeat and positive with him, and I know he felt that, and he felt like he wasn't loved and he pulled away, and then I felt like I wasn't loved, and then the cycle continued. I also acknowledged that it was unfair on him my standards were high (in comparison to his that is - my house isn't THAT clean and I'm not OCD about it or anything). 

Anyway, I wish I had recognised the issue sooner. I wish I communicated it better and sooner. I wish I didn't let the resentment grow. I think sometimes, especially later on, I wanted so badly for us to be okay that I suppressed myself because I didn't want it to turn into an argument or make things worse. I did briefly bring the issue up about a month ago (especially the whole mental load part and that I also like to have time for myself after work and I need more help sometimes) but I didn't get to speak about it as much as I wanted to and I was very worried about nagging him or pushing him further away. Then we got very busy (December is crazy) and I didn't get around to having the conversation again. 

I told him that I loved him at least once a day every single day, always the one to say it first. There was never any lying or cheating or intentionally hurting each other. In probably the last 6 months, I was always the one to initiate any physical affection. He would cuddle and kiss when I initiated, but I don't really think I can remember when he last approached me to even cuddle me first (when he wasn't drunk), even though he knows my love language is physical touch. I think he said once, when the issue first got spoken about, that he struggled to show me affection etc. because of the feelings he was having about everything being off and my mood towards him etc., which was fair I guess. 

I want him back so badly. I am desperate to try again. I asked him to try again now that I KNOW what the issue is and we actually have something SPECIFIC to work from this time, instead of me just feeling like there was something wrong with me in a super vague way, which was so devastatingly confusing for me. I honestly believe we’d be approaching it differently this time and together as a team, instead of me just trying to fix myself on my own. I could lower my standards and he could raise his slightly and we could implement some practical things to help us (e.g, get a cleaner in once a week, meal delivery (I do 99% of the cooking), a proper chore system, etc.). I also told him we could do couples therapy (he already sees a psych for himself) to get some professional help (which I am very keen to do). 

I haven't heard back from him since asking for another chance. I'm currently trying to give him space, which is hard, and is going to remain hard as we rent a place together, but he's currently staying at his mum's. I feel so heartbroken and so much grief and sadness. I couldn't bring myself to eat anything the first 24 hours. I can't believe he has left me and that I have probably lost my true love and my best friend. I feel so sick about it and I can't stop crying :( I feel so much guilt and regret. I am so upset at myself that I have probably ruined the best thing that has ever happened to me over fucking chores!?

But at the same time, I am trying to look deeper at what went wrong and how I can fix myself to be better in case he comes back to me. Based on what happened and what went wrong, I'm going to do the following: 
- I intend to get therapy for the first time in my life (though I'm quite nervous about it)
- I have started meditating (for my stress and mood)
- I'm going to try Reiki for the first time (to calm my nervous system down or something and help with the stress I feel)
- I know I need to work on my communication skills but not quite sure how yet 

As I said, I don't think he thinks the resentment from the uneven load sharing (and the issues that stemmed from that) is the only issue, so what else is then? Yes our dynamic changed but WHY if not that? The load sharing thing happened as soon as we moved in together and it's the only thing I can think of that really changed compared to when we weren't living together. So what else am I missing? :(",2,1767324097.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I am 71 years old and have been writing a memoir about my years as a traveling salesman in the 1970s and 80s, a job that no longer exists in the same form and which I thought might be interesting to document for younger generations.

The writing itself was enjoyable and I looked forward to it every morning with my coffee. The technical aspects of publishing were considerably less so and I will admit I got quite frustrated at times. I spent several weeks trying to understand how to get ISBN for my book, what the difference between print and ebook formatting is, how distribution actually works, and a dozen other questions that nobody seemed to answer in plain English.

My daughter eventually convinced me to stop torturing myself with the technical details and just work with a publisher who could handle it. After researching several options I chose palmetto and honestly it was the right decision for me. They registered the ISBN under my name so I still own it, handled all the copyright paperwork, formatted both the print and ebook versions, and set up distribution to Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers. I simply reviewed and approved things as we went along which was much more manageable than trying to learn it all myself.

The entire process took about four months and my book is now available wherever books are sold. I have ordered several cases of copies to give to family and old colleagues. For anyone else who finds the technical side overwhelming I would encourage you to get help rather than struggling through it alone, there is no shame in admitting you would rather focus on the writing and let professionals handle the rest.",1,1767323520.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False

A bit about me: I love a lot of different music (think metal/classical/chillstep/lofi/k-rap/etc), cooking gourmet meals for others, writing and reading poetry, sci-fi/fantasy books, queer literature, nature walks, coffee and tea (it's an obsession tbh), TV shows (the good place/schitts creek/owl house/etc), movies, TTRPG, animals of all shapes and sizes, LEGO, and just wiggling badly to music with my amazing partner and petting our dog Boba.

I really am looking for something to potentially become a close friendship/best friend if we really hit it off and you stick around.

1q1ngbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1q1ngbg/you_fall_to_the_level_of_your_environment/,You fall to the level of your environment,"We need to talk about why ""just have more willpower"" is terrible advice. I recently discovered research on environment design, and it completely changed how I think about habit formation. It explained exactly why I can't resist eating chips when they're visible on the counter, but have no cravings when they're hidden in a cabinet.

If you feel like you're constantly fighting against your own actions despite your best intentions, read this.

1. The Visibility Effect (Why willpower always fails)

The research I found explained that environment design isn't just helpful for habit change; it's the primary driver.

Every object in your visual field creates a psychological ""pull"" on your attention and behavior. The more visible something is, the more likely you are to engage with it. The problem is that most of us default-design our spaces for convenience rather than for our goals.

When your environment is working against your intentions:

Your willpower depletes rapidly throughout the day.

Your best-laid plans crumble in the face of visible temptations.

Your goals feel impossibly difficult despite your genuine desire to achieve them.

You aren't just ""undisciplined."" You have created an environment that makes bad habits easy and good habits difficult.

2. The Path of Least Resistance

Beyond the visual cues, there is the friction factor. The harsh reality is: ""Humans will nearly always choose the option with the least resistance, regardless of their stated values.""

We say we want to read more, but leave books on shelves while keeping our phones in our pockets. We claim we want to eat healthier, but store vegetables in crisper drawers while keeping snacks at eye level.

This constant battle against your own environment drains the mental energy you need to actually work toward meaningful change.

3. How to ""Design, Don't Decide"" (The Fix)

The only sustainable way forward is to redesign your environment. The goal is to shift from a Willpower Mindset to a Design Mindset. Here is the protocol I'm using to reshape my behavior without relying on motivation:

Phase 1: Friction Audit  
You need to identify where your environment is working against you.

The Rule: Analyze how many steps it takes to perform both good and bad habits in your current setup.

The Goal: Recognize that your ""choices"" are largely determined by the paths of least resistance in your environment.

Phase 2: The ""20-Second Rule""  
Make bad habits take 20 seconds longer and good habits 20 seconds faster.

Put the TV remote in a drawer rather than on the coffee table.

Set out workout clothes the night before.

Pre-cut vegetables and place them at eye level in the fridge.

The Shift: Even tiny amounts of added friction dramatically change behavior patterns.

Phase 3: Prime Your Spaces  
Your environment should trigger the right behaviors automatically.

Create activity zones (reading chair with no devices allowed, dedicated workout corner).

Use visual cues (water bottle on desk, fruit bowl on counter).

Remove competing stimuli (no TV in bedroom, no phone during meals).

Treat your environment like a behavior programming system. You wouldn't expect software to run without the right code; don't expect your habits to change without the right cues.",3,1767323378.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

Robot mops have become game-changers for people who want clean floors without the hassle.

**What Makes a Robot Mop Perfect for Small Spaces?**

You need a robot mop that can navigate tight corners and fit under furniture. The best models for apartments are compact, quiet, and smart enough to avoid getting stuck between your couch and coffee table.

**Key Features to Look For**

When choosing a robot mop for your apartment, focus on these important features:

- **Slim design** - Look for models under 3 inches tall that can slide under beds and sofas
- **Smart navigation** - Advanced sensors help avoid furniture and clean efficiently 
- **Quiet operation** - Your neighbors will thank you for choosing a quiet robot mop
- **Good battery life** - Should clean your entire apartment on one charge
- **Easy maintenance** - Simple water tank refilling and pad cleaning

**Top Robot Mop Options**

Several robot mops work great in small apartments. The iRobot Braava series excels at wet and dry mopping in compact spaces. The Roborock models offer excellent navigation and can handle both vacuuming and mopping.

For budget-conscious renters, basic mopping robots still do a solid job on hard floors. They might not have all the smart features, but they'll keep your floors clean.

You can check out some of the best-rated options at [this helpful comparison page](https://athomewave.com/robot-mop) that shows different models and their features.

**Making the Right Choice**

Consider your apartment's layout when picking a robot mop. If you have lots of furniture, prioritize navigation features. For studio apartments, a basic model might work just fine.

Most robot mops handle tile, hardwood, and laminate floors well. They're not meant for deep carpet cleaning, but they're perfect for the hard surfaces common in apartments.

**Getting Started**

Once you choose your robot mop, setup is usually straightforward. Clear the floor of small items, fill the water tank, and let it map your space. Most models learn your apartment's layout after a few cleaning cycles.

I had 1 cavity at 16 yo during my first pregnancy. I didn’t have any cavities for 11 years after that. Have always had great dental health and go every 6 months, was always complimented on my perfect teeth and no issues. I then was pregnant with my second child at 27 yo and also moved to another area and switched dentists. Starting in 2023 every single year, sometimes every 6 months, I have had cavities to be filled. Just 2 weeks ago I went (mind you I already had 2 fillings this summer) and was told I had 2 superficial cavities and 2 deeper ones between molars. On top of that last week I noticed my front tooth is chipped and it had to have happened within the last 7 days.

It literally feels like my teeth are falling apart when I do everything I should. I could blame pregnancy but like when do the cavities end? When I had an appointment during my pregnancy I had no cavities or gum issues, this all started postpartum. I did breastfeed for 21 months but I’m now 3 yrs postpartum and have really dove into caring for my teeth like never before when the cavities just kept coming but it hasn’t seemed to stop it. I also vaped disposable vapes (went through 1 every 3 weeks) for about a year but I quit vaping 8 months ago. I do whiten my teeth but usually just a few times a month with gel and a light. My teeth aren’t super sensitive. 

My kids and bf also go to this dentist (granted it is a chain office) and none of the have had any cavities diagnosed… but my kids have Medicaid and my bf is uninsured so I’m the only one with a commercial plan through my work. I don’t know if this would cause over diagnosing. I’m genuinely considering getting my dental records and taking a day to go 2.5 hrs to my old dentist to have him look and/or do any work. 

Things I do for oral health:

Brush 2x a day with electric toothbrush, floss last (coat it in toothpaste), use a water pick first, alternate flouride and hydroxyapatite toothpaste, MI paste a couple times a week at night. I don’t drink soft drinks or coffee regularly, maybe a sweet drink other than water 2-3 times a week max but I don’t have anything daily. I chew xylitol gum and drink water regularly each day. Just started using a mouth guard because I grind my teeth and I’m worried that’s what chipped my front tooth. I take a multivitamin but just started taking additional D3+K2 to help with calcium absorption. My most recent visit I paid OOP for flouride treatment that I requested.

I recently got a Jura E4 and I have been using medium roast beans on the ""normal"" setting (2 of 3 beans lit up on the machine). The default setting for coffee dispenses 120mL which is about half (just volume wise) of what I would have with a vertuo pod (230mL). To make up for this, I brew two coffees on my E4 and that fills up one of my coffee mugs.

I was talking to a family member about this and they were surprised at how much coffee I was drinking. They seemed to suggest that because I was brewing 2 coffees to fill up one cup it was twice the intensity of what I was previously drinking with a cup of nespresso. 

I understand there are a lot of variables at play here...but can someone help guide me into how I may figure out what my ""coffee"" intake is and how I can better understand how much I am consuming?

But in 2.5 when they split up the different combat groups, I was hoping we actually get to play as the different teams so I can feel more involved in the grand battle and they actually did! I feel it pulled off the pacing and emotional investment of a finale battle much better than 1.4.

**Yixuan:** I know Yixuan is a lot more divisive than Miyabi in terms of Void Hunter-tiers, but I really feel they did so much more and worked a lot harder to make me like Yixuan - Miyabi is lovable pretty much from the start - she was already hyped, very appealing personality and combat, she was in the Beta so matches everyone's first impression of the ZZZ aesthetic - but IMO over Year 2, Yixuan feels like a lot more of a nuanced and layered character & has a lot more of a relationship with the Proxy which I've grown to appreciate.

I was definitely on the Yixuan skeptic train from the start because of her outfit and ""magic-y"" powers, but the devs really persisted in working twice as hard to make Yixuan likeable and I really warmed up to her, even ended up liking her more than Miyabi. By that point, I was willing to handwave whatever explanations they have for her going missing the same way nobody really questions in comic books why Superman doesn't solve everyone's problems - at some point you just gotta play along and accept there's a tightrope to walk between having her be relevant enough as a big player yet not too omnipresent in the story.

**Waifei Peninsula:** While I'm not the hugest fan of Waifei and the general ""obligatory Chinese region"" gacha trend, I warmed up to it over time after knowing it was more into the ""Hong Kong martial arts movie"" theme than wuxia fantasy, and especially since the game still adds entire new regions like Fantasy Resort and exploration zones, Spook Shack and Krampus in general really endeared me to 2.x and reassured me that the character designs were still going to hit well. Even with more divisive designs like Yidhari and Lucia, I still could enjoy Yidhari's story and Lucia's EP ended up being my absolute favourite so far.

**General:** I do really think the devs took the ""we miss the urban aesthetic"" critiques to heart from a lot of the new features added lately. The customisable Functions menu reminds me of old Walkman-era players and Windows Media Player skins which is awesome. While I still wish Inter-Knot scrolling came back, the player guild Outpost feature definitely scratches that Inter-Knot itch *while* making it suitably meta by having actual players be involved instead of pregenerated NPC posts, which I found to be a satisfyingly creative way to address it.

# Story & Theme

Maybe I'm a sucker for sappy stories, but I really enjoyed this patch's story. I don't even think it made me as emotional as other Hoyo story arcs or was as satisfying as other arcs, but just experiencing it made me really appreciative of the writing. I might just be the super easily impressed kind of reader.

I know it's a common complaint that ""all the characters have a dead relative/were a soldier or experiment"", but one thing I always appreciated in ZZZ is how singularly it unifies its cast to its themes and central event: the Hollow disaster. I feel the importance of the Hollow disaster because nearly no character is completely untouched by it. I picture it like a post-World War II story where every character was alive to have fought in it, or knows someone who did. Many would be ex-military. Many would have lost someone in the war. It'd be odd not to meet someone who wasn't affected.

Yes, some of the backstories are somewhat repetitive in terms of origin, but I always enjoyed how the game explored the specifics of how those characters were affected by loss and how they dealt with it. Just because millions died in a war from bombings or in the trenches, completely identical to each other, doesn't mean each of their stories and the people connected to those lost lives were identical.

I always appreciated that ZZZ didn't just use its post-apocalypse setting as a cool backdrop for action scenes, but actually explored the trauma of a society that nearly survived extinction, yet still thrives and remains vibrant in spite of its suffering. The fact every character has lost someone or something to this world makes the world feel ever-present, and the characters a concrete part of its history.

2.5's story really put that to the forefront, with how much it emphasizes even the littlest things like enjoying the five senses, or the kindness of a chance childhood meeting. So much of it grapples with the ideas of ""is it better to suffer and survive, than to be perpetually safe from harm?"" and ""is life worth living even if one day it all is destroyed or forgotten?"" that I find really compelling and I love how ZZZ always put the emotional core and its characters at the centre of these questions. People often call this type of story ""Hopepunk"" and even if it can be repetitive, I always respect how ZZZ always engages and explores its central themes of hope and moving forward without fail.

I myself do miss the less supernatural, more underground Proxy plotline back when they were still maintaining their secret identities, but the fact their story still maintains the same central thread of the siblings trying to clear their mentor's name and how they're still coping with the effects of her loss and her actions has still kept me invested.

# Optimistic Thoughts

At this point, I've come to accept ZZZ's jank and mishaps in hindsight, whether it's mysterious delays or mismatched voicelines or unfortunate banner timings or the odd underwhelming character design, because 2.5 has really shown me that the ZZZ is a passion project, its devs really, *really* care about their game and are doing their best to figure it out, even if they can't please every single player in existence immediately. It feels less like the typical Hoyo screw I'm used to by now and more like growing pains of a game trying to define its place year by year in a constantly changing landscape.

I feel like complaining about black screen text or an image using posed 3D models instead of being drawn from scratch feel like such tiny, pointless nitpicks at this point, because the sheer amount of content delivered in 2.5 (along with how much of it is aimed towards directly improving on either player experience or iterating on previous shortfalls) really showed me the *hundreds* of plates the ZZZ team has to spin to even make this game worth playing daily, let alone satisfying.

Of course there's still things worthy of critique - this patch still has the obvious ""the new NPC introduced this patch who's kind of an asshole is secretly a villain"" trope, and I'll keep sending feedback about the pointless dialogue choices or other things that deserve critique or are worthy of review.

But I still got a satisfying story and an improved game experience out of it.  The amount of things I enjoyed this patch really put into perspective for me how trivial most (though not all) of my gripes were in the grand scheme of things. If losing a 4th animation in character select meant they cooked something even better in the long run, then fine. I'll still earnestly wish some things stay like more coffee options or better noodle shop, but I'm not gonna lose my head and cry ZZZ has ""lost its way or identity"" over it.

Because at this point the devs have enough of my trust that if they're not fixing it *now*, they're probably workshopping a better option for later. *Maybe* one day ZZZ will be such a cash cow that they won't care anymore, but since that's not the case yet, I'll continue enjoying it and greet the game's future with optimism and a level of trust.

\---

(For some optional, semi-related context, I was a fan of a animated show called RWBY for over 10 years, which had very similar tropes with ZZZ (post-apocalypse anime with a fantasy urban aesthetic and fighting monsters with cool weapons). RWBY had a ton of passion and earnest creativity starting out that ZZZ shares, but it *really* fumbled itself over the years in a way when I, as a longtime fan, could plainly feel its creators *did not* give a shit about critique or improving its story.

I mention this because that experience made me *hyper* aware of when something really has no clue what its identity is and doesn't care as long as fans keep showing up, vs. something that's still growing into itself and actively tries to improve, and I think ZZZ is squarely in the latter.)",15,1767322680.0,ZZZ_Official,2,0.86,False
1q1n6wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PayForResultsSEO/comments/1q1n6wd/stop_chasing_da_why_link_relevance_is_the_real/,Stop Chasing DA: Why Link Relevance is the Real SEO Ranking Factor,"# Stop Chasing DA: Why Link Relevance is the Real SEO Ranking Factor

For years, the SEO industry has been locked in a numbers game. Agencies sell links based on Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR), and business owners buy them, convinced that a higher number equals a better ranking. It is a comforting metric—a single, quantifiable score that supposedly tells you how ""powerful"" a website is.

But there is a problem with this approach. You can spend thousands of dollars acquiring high-DA backlinks and see absolutely no movement in your search engine rankings. Worse, you might see a decline.

This happens because you are optimizing for a third-party metric, not for Google. Google’s algorithms have evolved far beyond simple vote-counting. Today, the search engine prioritizes context and intent. A link from a massive news aggregator might look good on a spreadsheet, but if it has nothing to do with your industry, it is effectively noise.

To build a sustainable link building strategy that actually drives traffic and revenue, you need to stop obsessing over power and start prioritizing connection. It is time to understand why link relevance matters more than domain metrics.

# The Domain Authority Myth: Proxies Are Not Ranking Factors

Before we dissect relevance, we have to dismantle the pedestal we’ve put Domain Authority on. Metrics like DA (Moz), DR (Ahrefs), or TF (Majestic) are proprietary scores created by software companies. They are useful comparative tools, but they are not used by Google.

Google has explicitly stated that they do not use Domain Authority as a ranking signal. When you prioritize a link solely because it has a DA of 60+, you are chasing a ghost.

# Why the obsession persists

If Google doesn't use these metrics, why does the industry rely on them? The answer is convenience.

* **Sales:** It is easier to sell a ""DA 50 Link"" for $300 than it is to explain the nuanced value of a niche blog post.
* **Reporting:** It looks impressive to show a client a graph of rising average DA.
* **Laziness:** Analyzing relevance requires human judgment; analyzing DA requires a script.

However, high metrics often mask low quality. A site can inflate its DA through spammy link networks or by publishing thousands of pages of low-quality content to capture stray keywords. A link from such a site, despite its high ""score,"" offers zero value to your SEO performance.

# Understanding Link Relevance in the Age of Semantic Search

Google’s goal is to organize the world's information. To do this, it needs to understand the relationships between entities (things, people, places, and concepts).

When a website links to you, it is essentially voting for your content. But in modern SEO, not all votes are equal. Google analyzes the *thematic relationship* between the linking page and the target page. This is link relevance SEO in action.

If you run a specialized coffee roasting business, a link from a massive, generalist technology blog (even one with high metrics) is confusing. Why is a tech site vouching for coffee beans? The connection is weak.

Conversely, a link from a small, dedicated barista blog with a lower DA is incredibly powerful. It tells Google: ""Experts in the coffee industry trust this roaster."" This reinforces your topical authority and helps Google understand exactly where you fit in the knowledge graph.

# The three layers of relevance

To evaluate backlink relevance effectively, you should look at three distinct layers:

1. **Domain Relevance:** Is the overall theme of the website aligned with yours? (e.g., A fitness site linking to a supplement store).
2. **Page Relevance:** Is the specific article linking to you about a related topic? (e.g., An article about ""Best Post-Workout Recovery"" linking to your protein powder).
3. **Link Relevance:** Does the anchor text and the surrounding text make sense? (e.g., The link appears naturally within a sentence discussing nutrition).

# The David vs. Goliath Scenario: Low Metrics vs. High Relevance

Let’s look at a practical example of why metrics can be misleading and why a relevance-first approach wins.

Imagine you are doing SEO for a boutique agency that sells **accounting software for small businesses**. You have the budget for one high-quality link placement.

**Option A: The High-Metric Generalist**

* **Site:** A generic ""Lifestyle and News"" portal.
* **Metrics:** DA 75, Traffic 500k/month.
* **Content:** The link is placed in an article titled ""10 Tips for a Better Work-Life Balance.""
* **Context:** The mention is vague: ""Use tools to save time, like this accounting software.""

**Option B: The Low-Metric Specialist**

* **Site:** A niche blog dedicated to ""Fintech for Startups.""
* **Metrics:** DA 25, Traffic 5k/month.
* **Content:** The link is placed in a deep-dive review titled ""The Best Accounting Tools for Bootstrapped Startups in 2024.""
* **Context:** The link is a specific recommendation for your software's invoicing feature.

# The Winner? Option B.

Despite Option A having ""better"" metrics, Option B is the superior link for several reasons:

1. **Audience Alignment:** The readers of the Fintech blog are actually looking for accounting software. The readers of the lifestyle blog are not. Option B will drive *referral traffic* that actually converts.
2. **Semantic Signal:** Google associates the Fintech blog with terms like ""finance,"" ""SaaS,"" and ""invoicing."" A link from there transfers that topical relevance to your site.
3. **Sustainability:** Option A looks like a paid placement (a ""guest post farm""). Option B looks like a genuine editorial citation.

By choosing Option B, you are building quality backlinks that contribute to your site’s expertise, rather than just inflating a vanity metric.

# Contextual Backlinks: It’s Not Just Who, But Where

Relevance isn't just about the domain; it is about the placement. This is where the concept of **contextual backlinks** becomes vital.

A link buried in the footer or the sidebar is generally ignored by search engines. These are often site-wide links that offer little semantic value. Similarly, a link in an ""Author Bio"" box is clearly self-promotional and carries less weight.

The gold standard is a link embedded within the main body content of a relevant paragraph. Google uses natural language processing (NLP) to read the words *surrounding* your link.

If the text around your link discusses ""tax automation,"" ""IRS compliance,"" and ""financial reporting,"" and then links to your accounting software, those surrounding keywords act as clues. They tell Google exactly what your page is about. This context amplifies the power of the link, regardless of the Domain Authority of the host site.

# Risk Reduction: Relevance as a Shield

There is another massive advantage to prioritizing relevance over metrics: security.

Google’s spam filters (like Penguin and subsequent ""SpamBrain"" updates) are constantly hunting for manipulative link patterns. One of the easiest patterns for AI to spot is a lack of relevance. When a gambling site links to a bakery, or a fashion blog links to an industrial roof repair company, it raises an immediate red flag. These connections do not happen in nature. They only happen when money changes hands.

By focusing on link relevance SEO, you are naturally insulating your website from penalties. When you secure links from industry-adjacent sites, you are mimicking natural growth.

* It makes sense for a wedding photographer to link to a florist.
* It makes sense for a software developer to link to a web host.
* It makes sense for a mechanic to link to an auto parts manufacturer.

These links are defensible. If a manual reviewer from Google were to look at your backlink profile, they would see a logical ecosystem of professional connections, not a random assortment of high-DA unrelated domains.

# How to Pivot Your Link Building Strategy

Moving away from the comfort of DA scores requires a shift in mindset. You need to start evaluating opportunities based on topical alignment. Here is how to refine your link building strategy to focus on quality backlinks:

# 1. Analyze the ""Neighborhood""

Before pursuing a link, look at who else the site links to. Do they link to reputable sites in your niche? Or do they link to essay writing services, casinos, and crypto schemes? A site with a ""bad neighborhood"" is toxic, regardless of its DA.

# 2. Check for Topical Authority

Does the site have a clear focus? A site that covers tech, health, travel, finance, and pets is usually a ""content farm"" designed to sell links. A site that covers *only* sustainable travel is an authority. Aim for the specialists.

# 3. Prioritize Traffic Over Metrics

If you must look at a metric, look at organic traffic (using tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs). If a site has a DA of 60 but zero organic traffic from Google, it means Google has penalized or ignored that site. A link from a site Google ignores is worthless. A site with legitimate traffic—even if the DA is low—is a site Google trusts.

# 4. The ""Referral Test""

Ask yourself: ""If Google didn't exist, would I still want this link?""  
If the answer is yes because it would bring potential customers to your site, then it is a highly relevant link. If the answer is no, you are likely just chasing metrics.

# Relevance is the Future of Authority

We are moving toward a web where authority is not a singular score, but a relative concept. You can be an authority on ""vegan leather boots"" without being an authority on ""leather care"" generally. Google wants to rank the most relevant expert for the specific query.

When you prioritize relevance, you are feeding Google exactly what it wants: clear signals about who you are, what you do, and who trusts you.

High DA links are expensive, risky, and often ineffective. Relevant links are authentic, defensible, and drive real growth. Stop worrying about the metrics on a third-party toolbar and start building a network of meaningful connections within your industry. That is how you win in modern SEO.

# FAQ: Link Relevance and Metrics

# Is Domain Authority important for SEO?

Domain Authority (DA) itself is not a Google ranking factor. It is a metric developed by Moz to predict how well a website will rank. While it correlates with ranking potential, improving your DA score does not directly improve your Google rankings. You should view it as a comparative benchmark, not a KPI.

# Are low-DA backlinks worth anything?

Yes, absolutely. A backlink from a low-DA site can be incredibly valuable if it is highly relevant to your niche. If the linking site has real traffic and is topically aligned with your content, it passes ""topical authority"" to your site. Often, a DA 20 link from a strict competitor or niche partner is worth more than a DA 60 link from a generic news site.

# How do I evaluate backlink relevance?

To evaluate relevance, look at the content surrounding the link. Does the article topic match your page's topic? Does the website's general audience overlap with your target audience? If the transition from their site to yours feels natural and helpful to a reader, the link is likely relevant.

# Can irrelevant links hurt SEO?

Yes. A large volume of irrelevant links can signal to Google that you are engaging in manipulative link building schemes. This can lead to algorithmic devaluation (where the links are simply ignored) or, in severe cases, manual penalties that remove your site from search results. It confuses Google regarding what your site is actually about.

I have personally always used Hario filters and manipulated agitation to control draw down time and avoid clogs.

For context, my baseline recipe for dialing in is 16g beans, 250g water, 205F water, grind size on the medium-coarse end for pourover. I always start by trying a 50g bloom for 30-45 seconds then slowly pour in the remaining water in a single pour, usually giving about a 2:10-2:50 total draw down depending on the coffee.

From here under extraction is an easy fix: just increase the amount of separate pours, pour more aggressively, or add some swirling to increase agitation and slow down the draw.

If it is over extracted and bitter then I pull out my ""ligma spoon"" and pour the water onto the spoon close to the water surface or even slightly under it to break the waters fall, causing the least amount of agitation possible. Doing this I can reduce the draw time of my second (first excluding bloom) pour (200g) down to 45 seconds if I want. If this is to fast then I can add as much agitation as needed by swirling or stirring.

**So by controlling agitation like this and leaving all other parameters alone I can reliably make total brew time range from 1:15 to 4:00+ minutes**, including a 30 second bloom in each time.

1q1my5y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1my5y,"Week 1: New Year, New Recipe - Chiffon Cake with Tea Infused Whipped Cream","Happy New Year 🎊  I baked this plain chiffon cake (with apple tea, plum barley tea, and cinnamon puer infused whipped creams to pair) on the 31st and tasted it just after midnight, so truly a new year‘s new recipe 🎆

This is my first cake in over ten years! I first tried to bake one in… 2011, I believe? Just a plain yellow cake, but wasn’t patient enough to let it cool for the multiple hours it needed, so it stuck to the pan and I made trifle instead. Told myself that cakes weren’t for me, apparently!

Recently I was thinking about my time in Japan and these little chiffon cakes I’d get from the mall by the train station. After a rabbit hole of research, it seems the company doesn’t exist anymore. Their chiffon cake was so light but still had a nice chew, and they paired them with fresh whipped cream that sometimes had flavor infused into it. The best was the black tea flavor, I think about it all the time!

I finally decided that if I’d never get those cakes again, I may as well finally try and make my own, using my vast collection of Japanese teas. I was despairing over what pan to buy when one basically fell into my lap at an antique store, so for New Years, I swallowed my cake fears and tried it out, using this recipe: [https://int.japanesetaste.com/blogs/japanese-taste-recipes/how-to-make-a-light-fluffy-chiffon-cake-japanese-style-chiffon-cake-recipe](https://int.japanesetaste.com/blogs/japanese-taste-recipes/how-to-make-a-light-fluffy-chiffon-cake-japanese-style-chiffon-cake-recipe)

I was a bit afraid of leaving it in too long and drying it out, but when I took it out I thought the top looked a bit pale and I do believe it is slightly underdone along the top and center (just looks a bit more dense). But!! I let it cool for many hours before successfully releasing it and I’m extremely happy it turned out as well as it did! Getting over my cake traumas finally. I also wonder if I should’ve tried to get more of the larger air bubbles out before baking? I was afraid of knocking too much air out of the meringue though, I do live in a very humid place so I wanted to be very gentle with it. I’ve never made a meringue before and had a moment of despair before it finally came together.

The whipped creams were their own battle - I should’ve made more of each flavor, I think the tiny batches I did worked against me, and one of them I accidentally turned into a (very delicious) butter, but the tea infusions tasted very good! The apple black tea is probably my favorite, the cinnamon puer is a close second (but its the one that turned to butter…), and the plum barley ended up tasting actually rather like coffee (in a good way!). I’ll definitely experiment more with these and I’m sure the cream infusion process will get easier.

I hope everyone’s enjoying their new bakes 🫶 I just learned about this sub last week and it seemed like a good way to grow my skills to participate this year as best I can! Already have a few ideas lined up for the next few weeks. ",12,1767321979.0,52weeksofbaking,1,1.0,False

She turns her head to or spits a LOT of things out now that she used to gobble up, like squash, sweet potato, yogurt, corn. She won’t eat much at all unless it’s from my plate, which was never a thing until now. To get her to eat breakfast I have to sit with her at coffee table and feed her with my fork from my plate. She won’t do it herself anymore. At dinner she will take food from my plate and spit it out or throw it on the floor over and over. I usually offer what we eat for breakfast and dinner with a safe food on the plate but her safe foods are dwindling and inconsistent. 
  
I’m having a hard time not getting frustrated. Any tips? Or is this just something I should expect now that she’s really entering toddlerhood and I just need to adjust my expectations?

(32F) I live in East Van and I am looking for folks who also live in the East Van area to connect with this Sat Jan 3rd and Wed Jan 7th and do some journalling/discussion surrounding topics of identity. 

I’m interested in social justice advocacy of the BIPOC & 2SLGBTQIA+ community, mental health, intersectionality, therapy and decolonized self-development. I would love to connect with more individuals to chat about these topics/have meaningful convos to feel more connected.

These are some ideas of journal prompts I was thinking we could pick and choose from and journal/chat about: 

* When have you felt the most authentic and what allowed that part of you to come forward? 
* Describe a time you felt a strong sense of belonging in a group. What was happening, and what made you feel that way?
* How have gender stereotypes impacted the way you move through the world? Are there any ways you challenge gender stereotypes in your day to day life?
* How do your intersecting identities (eg: race, gender, ability, sexuality, etc.) influence your world view? 
* What assumptions do people often make about you/your personality and how accurate or inaccurate are they? 

If this is something you are interested in, send me a DM with

* Your name
* Pronouns
* Age
* Area you live in 

And I’ll send you the time and location of the meet-ups. Hope to see you there and looking forward to connecting soon! ",1,1767321592.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,0.67,False

Note, not everyone’s side effects may be the same. I started 150 mg 12/1.

First week: The first day I took it at 7:30am as advised and had intense anxiety at work that lasted until 5pm. I only drank half a cup of coffee and dumped the rest I was so jittery. I decided to cut off coffee to prevent it from happening again.

Day 2-5: I was nervous every morning taking it, but determined that I’m taking the right steps to fight my depression and give this a real shot. Took it and still had some anxiety, but not as intense as the first day. I also started to have very weird vivid dreams that felt real as if I was never fully asleep. These dreams would wake me up around 4am and unable to go back to sleep. I felt exhausted, but when I took the pill at 7am would have a ton of energy and be productive at work despite only 4-5 hours of sleep. 

Day 6-7: anxiety began to settle, I attributed it to me cutting out all coffee/caffeine etc. I also noticed that I had higher executive functioning at work and felt more calm. I had more control of my thoughts and rumination time was slowing down. I could pull myself out quicker vs spiraling for hours. I also noticed that I didn’t have the desire to drink wine after work anymore or to turn for it when stressful events happened.

Day 8-12: anxiety spiked slightly, but not as bad as those first 3 days. My partner said I was far more productive and I did feel more motivated to cook when I got home from work vs doom scroll on the couch. Could have been placebo, but I was starting to feel more like myself for the first time in years in terms of productivity and no longer numb. The lack of sleep did continue along with vivid dreams, but I also got another weird side effect - night sweats. I was sweating like I never have before and would wake up from nightmares drenched in sweat. Ladies, my breasts were also super sore for a few days. I wasn’t sure if this was related but searched this sub and some people have experienced this. 

Day 12-15: The vivid dreams continued and night sweats. Anxiety way down, almost none except situational anxiety (presenting at work). The vivid dreams and night sweats continued. I was now feeling exhausted on the 4-5 hours of sleep nightly and taking the pill in the morning no longer gave me that stimulant feeling. I had an appointment with my doctor on the 15th and she prescribed be Seroquel. 

Day 15-20: Night sweats stopped, not sure if it was due to the seroquel and no longer having dreams where I still felt awake OR my body was now getting more used to the bupropion. Anxiety completely gone, rumination controllable, no more doom scrolling on the couch for hours and I felt social again! Started to call and check on my friends and family more, my social battery had been down all year where this was previously touch for me. I also was recently promoted and now have a team, it helped me be more present and show up for them more.
I did feel more irritable than normal and had a short fuse, especially for drivers or people doing dumb things at the grocery store or work. 

Day 20-25: I felt in control of my thoughts and emotions for the first time in years. The numbness was finally fading. Seroquel makes me too groggy though and it’s super tough to get up in the morning. Luckily I was off work for the holidays so could sleep in later. I started splitting and taking half, but still quite groggy in the morning. I’ve never had so much trouble getting up. I go back to work soon - not sure if I’ll continue taking it. I may ask the doctor for something else as a sleep aid. I started coffee again, but half decaf to get me going in the morning. Tried full caffeine on day 25, it’s no longer impacting me like it did in the beginning? I also no longer have the stimulant effect in the mornings, maybe my honeymoon period is over. I miss it already and get what everyone was talking about on this sub now. 

Day 25-30: irritability is finally fading, it’s been a life changing experience for me and I am hoping it continues to help me over the next few months. Majority of negative side effects are gone, I just need to figure out the sleeping part. My dog had to have emergency surgery and I would have normally spiraled, but I was calm and felt in control. My social battery is still way up, executive function up at work, I also read 4 books this month. I asked my partner what he has noticed and he said 1. I’m no longer on the couch for hours sad 2. I’m more in control of my anxiety when we leave the house 3. I seem happier and finally present . For me personally, it’s been life changing because I no longer numb and feel life again vs going through the motions. I am noticing the small things that make life beautiful again. I’m not putting myself down or tough on myself when I make mistakes and give myself grace. I hope this continues, happy to report back of anyone is interested. This is my month one reflection, also if anyone has tips on sleep - I’ll take them!

I hope this helps anyone that may be going through their first month! ",5,1767321575.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

Had no idea how I was going to haul it off so I called some junk removal guy. Then I didn’t want to waste the trip and started the Great Unfuckening. I got a trash bag of clutter out of my dresser, one from underneath my kitchen sink, and one from my linen closet. Full bags! I moved a skinny table from my dining room into the living room, and realized it was so cramped in there! I took all the extra furniture from my spare room (my kitty likes to get away from my dog and so he kind of hangs out in there most of the time and it turned into a cat hair maze) and donated some of it and took what I wanted to save out to my storage shed. Since the room was so empty I gave it a good clean, got him an extra litter box because I thought it would be nice for him to have more options, and moved an extra loveseat out of the living room into there and now he has an “apartment” to hang out in with all his cat things. I even found a small air purifier that I wasn’t using and gave that to him. 

Moving the love seat opened up the living room a ton! I feel so much less claustrophobic. Yesterday I did dishes and laundry all day, got them all put away. I deep cleaned the bathroom and tossed a bag full of empties. I have three large bulk size trash bags of clutter/garbage sitting out on my porch that I believe contains the very last bit of stuff that needed to go. This is the last messy room! I’m going to set a timer and see if I can do a final push to finish! The living room is a struggle for me for some reason, it’s not as bad as the kitchen but since my entryway is there everything gets “dumped” so to speak, and the dog hangs out there a lot and gets things all hairy. 

I need to
- Vacuum
- Put the blue bag in my car for shopping
Straighten the couch covers and pillows 
- pick up the dog puzzle 
- unpack and put away the clothes in the gym bag 
- Put the big box in my car because it needs to go to work with me
- take the water and flower seeds out to the shed
- find homes for things on the coffee table (mostly photos) 
- dust the trinket shelves on the back wall 

Wish me luck! I wish I had photos of before I did the other rooms! I can’t wait for the junk guy to come and take the piles away! ",32,1767321487.0,ufyh,5,0.98,False

1q1mpju,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1q1mpju/earlystage_coffee_business_shipping_uncertainty/,"Early-stage coffee business: shipping uncertainty, scaling decisions, and selling challenges","I run a very small roasted coffee business (whole bean and ground). It’s early-stage and currently operates on a made-to-order basis — no inventory yet.

My main operational challenge right now is shipping:
- Couriers require final weight and box dimensions to quote accurately.
- My supplier only confirms those after production.
- This makes pricing, margins, and customer quotes difficult to lock down.

On top of that, I have a non-sales-oriented profile. I’m introverted and struggle with traditional outbound selling or direct customer approaches. This affects:
- How I acquire customers
- How aggressively I can push sales
- Which growth strategies are realistically sustainable for me

Because of this, I’m considering whether it makes sense to:
- Invest in an industrial grinder and handle grinding + packaging in-house to standardize weights and shipping, or
- Stay made-to-order longer and focus on systems or channels that reduce the need for direct selling.

Sales are modest, margins are thin, and I can invest — but I want to avoid premature scaling or investing in the wrong bottleneck.

Looking for practical guidance:
- How did you handle shipping before having inventory?
- When did you know it was time to bring packaging in-house?
- Are there sales or growth strategies that work better for founders who aren’t strong at direct selling?",1,1767321311.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False
