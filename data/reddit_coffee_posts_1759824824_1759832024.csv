1o0ap7x,https://i.redd.it/nvfziolmzntf1.jpeg,Secret to healthy lips that most people miss," Have you ever noticed that after a long walk, a coffee break outdoors, or even just a few minutes in the sun, your lips start feeling tight and dry, and your first instinct is to lick them? That little lick gives an instant relief, but almost immediately, the dryness comes back stronger.
Over the years, I’ve seen countless patients fall into this exact cycle. Constantly licking the lips actually strips away their natural moisture, making them even more dehydrated. Some even notice that repeated dryness and irritation slowly darken their lips over time.
The solution to their problem is simple, which I suggested to them is brightening lip balm with SPF 50+. The usage of this will do more than just hydration. This will protect their lips from sun damage, which can contribute to both darkening and premature aging. With regular use, it keeps lips soft, restores their natural tone, and, most importantly, breaks the cycle of dryness that makes you instinctively reach for that lick.
It’s a small daily step, but it can make a real difference. Over time, your lips will start to stay healthier, smoother, and protected, no matter how much time you spend in the sun.

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I just want to know the perspective of other men on why my ex keeps on doing this.

I had an ex for 4 years. The relationship was so damn toxic, at umalis na talaga ako kasi di ko na kinaya yung bigat. Di ko siya maaasahan in critical moments, and more than a decade na rin siyang walang maayos na finances. He's already 32 (I'm 27), but di ko pa rin maaasahan. Binuhat ko siya financially for more than a year in my last hope na makakasecure siya ng maayos na trabaho. He quit after 5 months dahil lang daw naiistress siya, which made me feel invalidated kasi I've been stressed both in career and personal life, pero I pushed through while ang dali lang niya magquit sa trabaho.

When we broke up, he had the usual lovebombing para lang balikan ko siya, which is di ko kinagat kasi the lovebombing cannot make the 4 years of stress and toxicity go away. Plus, he owed me 30k, which I could've used for my medical needs but chose to invest in him and gave him a chance. Ni hindi man lang siya nakafeel ng sense of urgency despite seeing me desperately needing it.

To the post-breakup abuse, it includes looking for reasons to contact me kahit na clear na sinabi kong ayoko. He also spreaded lies on social media na ako raw yung di makamove on, na assuming daw ako kasi yung pakikipagcommunicate niya is wanting to be friends lang daw sa akin at hindi pagbabalikan, high maintenance daw ako (which is true, but I'm the one paying for all of it so idk what he's complaining about). What's worse is that he spreaded lies about how I'm the reason he's broke. Ang sinabi niyang reason is pinilit ko raw siya maging employee lang, when he could've earned more as a businessman. The truth is, I believed in him for 3 years and it yielded no results. I only asked him to work in corporate for the meantime para lang may funds siya for daily needs and his business in the future.

Aside from that, he also read my emails without my consent. Context is, last year nadepress siya sa work. Though I feel bitter about it, I decided to set it aside and support him instead. I subscribed to Netflix and logged it in on his laptop, which is connected sa email ko.

His reason was bullshit. Naglilinis lang daw siya ng laptop at nakita na nakalog in pa raw email ko. Imbes na maging decent person siya and log it off, he proceeded to go through my emails, and even got a hold of my boyfriend's passport.

To mess with me, he created a dummy account using my boyfriend's identity. All hell broke loose. I am considering of filing a case against him. Umabot kami sa point na nadamay na parents namin, at binaliktad niya yung story sa parents niya, making it seem like ako yung toxic, that's why nasabihan ako ng mama niya na ""buti nalang nakita namin yung tunay mong ugali bago kayo ikasal.""

After that incident, natahimik naman. I thought that's the end of it. But this morning, nagmessage ulit siya, inviting me for a coffee. I already blocked his numbers and forgot this one. Marami siyang numbers and all of them aren't saved, kaya di ko matandaan which is which.

I immediately blocked him. I'm so curious bakit ganon ang takbo ng isip niya. After everything, he's acting all friendly. I already followed everyone's advice na di siya pansinin, but he seems persistent. No matter what I do, nothing seems to work, and he would always bother me.

He knows how to fuck me up mentally and emotionally because he has known me for 5 years now. I feel powerless because I'm not the type of a person who manipulates others. I'm the ""wearing my heart on my sleeves"" kind of person, kaya di ko talaga alam ano yung depensa ko dito.

I'm also planning to change my phone number after I settled everything, to make sure there's zero contact na. I still feel anxious dahil I don't know what he saved from my email, the possible identity theft na magagawa niya sa boyfriend ko for having his passport, and I just feel like he'd never stop until makuha niya yung gusto niya. I've considered suicide multiple times na because I cannot handle work stress and the stress I got from him. I just feel like understanding how he thinks will help me know what I can do to completely make him stop.",0,1759831745.0,AskPinoyMen,0,0.5,False

What’s the feature:  50+ scenarios: from “Hey, I want a latte” to “Tell me about yourself in an interview”.  Speak out loud, and the AI flows naturally like a real person. Instant tips on pronunciation, flow, and intonation.  Replay any fail without the fear of “what’s wrong with you?”

So far I’ve “ordered coffee,” “booked a hostel,” and nearly forgot it was AI, not a human. Bottom line: if you want chill live convo practice with zero stress, this is a win.

Dear people of San Diego,

I am a 36 year old dude from Frankfurt, Germany. I was born & raised here and even though i've been to some places in europe, i was never able to make my dream of visiting the US come true - it always seemed too expensive and flying overseas is something else than driving to Italy or taking a plane to London.

I grew up in a pretty rough environment with a single mom so spending much money on vacation was never possible when i was younger. But as some of you might know, we had and still have many active US Army over here in germany and especially in the western parts (Frankfurt, Hanau, Wiesbaden, ..) americans have always been present. This made me come in contact with americans all through out my life, my closest friend to this day is an american as well. This and of course the Hollywood & Music influence always made me want to visit your beautiful country one day.

Ive been working a pretty good job for the past years so i was able to save up some money. Also i met a girl last year and made her my girlfriend. Her Dad, who she unfortunately never had close contact with, was an american soldier as well. It was also her dream to visit the US one day.

Long story short: we found a nice offer and booked 2 weeks in California & Nevada in July, this trip now took place from September 18th - October 3rd. It was AWESOME. 

We started off in San Francisco, then went to L.A. before heading out to Vegas. Every city had many nice, but also some not so nice parts to it, as one can imagine given the size and the usual problems that come with it. Vegas is something totally different than everything i've experienced before in a city, San Francisco has a beautiful park, i only knew the Golden Gate Bridge from movies and the open Drug influence was quite similar to our Situation in Frankfurt, but still a beautiful city. Before we went to San Diego i told my girlfriend that i could really imagine living in L.A. as it has everything and more... but then... then we went to Diego for the last 4 days of our trip and boy, it was BEAUTIFUL. 

Now, we didnt have the best location for our hotel as it was located right next to a big Main street and right between other hotels, Fast Food joints and more (we're pretty much into healthy living so we never went to any Fast Food Chain and even worked out a couple of times in LA and San Diego)

But let me tell you: San Diego is an amazing city. Every Interaction we had with your neighbors was kind, we were able to work out at a very nice gym and everytime i had any kind of question to locals they were super friendly, even though our english - while still really good - didnt sound like we were locals ourselves :) i went to a gun range and it was surprising to me how unproblematic it was for us as foreigners to be able to shoot some guns (i dont mean this in any kind of negative way, i know its a sensitive topic and i respect every opinion, but it was something i always wanted to do. We have gun Ranges as well, but they are way more strict as to who is allowed in and waaaay more expensive) the instructors were cool and in the booth next to mine i even met a guy from Frankfurt. Its a small world, i guess.

We also went to Mission Beach and it was a dream. The weather was beautiful and i was able to swim in the ocean for a while. 

The last day of our trip we were in Balboa Park and it was a very cool & interesting conclusion to our trip. We went in some of the museums and an exhibit about Cannibalism and had some nice coffee in the park as well. Speaking of coffee: there is a Café in a plant nursery. Ive never seen something like that, its a great business Idea and it was packed when we first went there.

On the way home i told my girl to forget what i said about L.A. while i still like the city, now my favorite city in the US is CLEARLY San Diego. I know i havent seen a small fraction of your country yet but in my heart i know that San Diego would be the perfect city for us to raise our future kids in. Dont get me wrong: i love my city, i have my roots here and i never thought i could leave it for good. And i also know as a tourist spending a couple of days in a city doesnt give you all the clues about it, but the vibe, the scenery, the stores, the food and the people, everything was amazing.

So sorry for the long post, it wasnt planned that way. All i wanted to do is to thank you for your hospitality and remind you of the fact you live in a very nice place. If any of you ever finds theirselves out here in Frankfurt, hit me up. I would love to be as good as a host as you all were to us!

Do you ever feel a little lost in the world? Like everything is moving faster than it needs to? I do sometimes. Lately I’ve realised how much it helps to slow down and just talk with someone steady. Someone who listens, who makes things feel a bit simpler when life starts to blur.

Because I don’t know if you’re like me, but the world can feel heavy at times. All the noise, the pressure to shine brighter, to move faster. And underneath all of that, I think most of us are just hoping to feel safe and seen by someone kind.

I’ve always believed that the best connections are simple. Two people who can talk about anything or nothing. Who can share a quiet moment without needing to fill it. Who leave each other feeling a little lighter, even if it’s just through words on a screen.

I like gentle things. Slow afternoons. A good cup of coffee. Music that fits the mood. Writing helps me make sense of it all. It makes me notice the small things most people rush past. The way light moves through a window. The pause before someone smiles. The quiet details that make an ordinary life feel full.

I’m based in Sydney and I lean toward the calm side of things. I enjoy comics, anime, and manga because they often capture humanity in surprising ways. I like finding new shows, new music, and just feeling at ease in good company.

I’m not looking for anything intense or complicated. Just a genuine chat. A space to talk about the day, a thought that’s been sitting quietly in your mind, or something that made you smile. Sometimes that’s all it takes to make life feel a little softer.

I’m in the city now and then, so if a natural rhythm builds between us, maybe a coffee one day. But if it stays here, that’s perfectly fine too. Sometimes just knowing a thoughtful person is out there is enough.

If any of this feels familiar, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me what’s been bringing you a little peace lately.

And if I could offer one small reminder, it would be this. In the middle of all the noise and expectation, you’re already doing so much better than you think.",1,1759831366.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

It’s like I get a big knot in my stomach and I would rather have  something easy to swallow which is a drink. Such as a coffee, smoothie or tea. 

I can’t speak to anyone about this because there aren’t many supportive people in my life. Toxic family! Woo hoo. That only focus conversations about weight! (Sarcasm) 

But i’m in uni and I need energy because my battery is LOW at the end of the day. And I need to be able to concentrate but I don’t want to eat around others or eat solid foods. So I just have coffee! 

So yeah, any advice would be appreciated. And I understand if this post is not allowed and will be taken down. If that is the case, could you tell me where I can go or post it?

1o0agzu,https://i.redd.it/u66jl7g9xntf1.png,Hermes Buyers' Dirty Secret - Why Even the Wealthy Choose Reps!,"Working in this field for many years, I've met hundreds of people who can afford an original Hermes, not just ""scrape together"" but buy it as easily as you buy coffee every morning. But they consciously buy quality reps and at first this shocked me. After all, we're not talking about poor students, but people with incomes in the millions.

One acquaintance from Monaco has a collection of original Birkins worth more than 500,000. At home. And she wears reps on the street. ""Why risk a bag worth 50,000 while traveling or in daily life?"" she says. The logic is ironclad.

Another case - a businessman from Dubai. Bought his wife an original Birkin for 35,000, she wore it for a month and put it in the closet. Too afraid to damage it, scratch it, it could be stolen. Then he bought a quality rep for 2,500 - she wears it every day and is happy.

It's not about money, but practicality. When you can afford anything, you start thinking differently. 30,000 for a bag you're afraid to use or $2,000 for a copy you live with peacefully?

The wealthy count money better than the poor. They understand that overpaying 15 times doesn't give 15 times quality improvement. The last 20% of quality costs 80% of the price - this is an unreasonable investment if the bag is for use, not for storage.

Status? In their circles everyone knows everyone has money for the original. Wearing a rep isn't a sign of poverty, but a sign of intelligence. ""I'm rich enough not to overpay"" - that's the real flex.

I met a surgeon who earns 800,000 a year. Wears a Birkin rep to work. ""My hands are in blood every day, am I going to stain the original?"" Bought a quality copy for 2,000 and is satisfied.

An investor from London said a phrase that explains everything: ""I buy original Hermes as assets, they sit in a safe and grow in value. And I buy reps for life. Different goals - different tools.""

Many wealthy people have 1-2 originals for special occasions and several quality reps for everyday life. This isn't greed, it's common sense.

A woman who manages a family business with 50 million turnover explained it like this: ""My original Birkin costs 40,000. I wear a rep for 2,500. I invest the 37,500 difference in business and earn more. Visually no one can tell the difference, and I get income.""

A traveler with a private jet told me: ""I fly to Europe for weekends - I take reps. I don't want customs problems, don't want to carry documents for 100,000 worth of bags, don't want to worry if they lose my luggage.""

A gallery owner in New York keeps originals as part of her art collection. Buys rare pieces at auctions. But every day she wears a rep. ""Originals for the soul and investments, reps for life.""

Most interesting - some wealthy people specifically wear reps to not attract attention. In certain neighborhoods it's unsafe to walk with an original Hermes. A rep gives the needed style without risk.

A doctor told how a colleague lost an original Kelly worth 25,000 in the hospital. Someone stole it from the break room. Since then she only wears reps to work.

This doesn't mean originals are bad. They're beautiful, they're art, investment, history. But for many wealthy people a quality rep is a reasonable choice for everyday life.

The luxury industry doesn't talk about this out loud, but knows it. Why do you think the rep market is growing even when the economy is fine? Because even those who can afford the original choose practicality.",1,1759831071.0,Bebebai,0,1.0,False

I generally have 4-5 close non romantic relationships in my life which are emotionally close. I’ve had a few guy friends who i thought of dating but never worked out because of individual careers. Wanted to date them since i heavily prioritise emotional compatibility.

Now my only option left is dating new people. Often I’ve observed that I’m a good listener and make people at ease whenever I interact with them. However earlier I did not reveal a lot about myself initially unless specifically asked. With therapy I’ve been feeling bold enough to finally start expressing myself more.

Now when it comes to dating I feel like I’m still at a point where I’m interacting with people and they are very willing to share a lot but when it comes to listening, it just comes to me struggling to bring forward my points.

For example, yesterday with this guy, i was expressing how pissed I am that I have to work for almost 24 hours while being on my period on an upcoming work day. We have been on 3 dates earlier. The guys response was well that’s okay but since on the said day I am in the city, you should take out time for coffee.

I expected him to empathise or atleast say well that sucks before moving on. Am I expecting too much? Since this is the first time I’m expressing myself as it is without filters, it’s a bit confusing for me.

I had found a SD on a dating app  around June/ julyish and we hit it off well, and he started to promise me a lot, paying my tuition, buying me a car ect. I was really skeptical of him but we FaceTimed and he eased it a bit. we went and grabbed some coffee to get to know each other then we started to set expectations. we both agreed it would be non monogamous, Mutual relationship, I wasn’t looking to get married or have kids and he said he was ok with that, which made sense because that’s what his profile said as well. Fast forward a month and he’s telling me he wants to Mary me, have me drop out and move in with him so I wouldn’t have to work, and he even told me to stop my birth control so he could “knock me up”. I stood my ground on my boundaries and he told me that it was a fantasy and that “we’ll see when we get there” then a month later he’s talking to me like that again and threatened to stop my allowance if I didn’t stop my birth control, I absolutely lost it and told him that’s it’s every obvious that you want something different from me and that there are plenty of other sb that are looking for what you want, but you know that I don’t want that and I’m no longer gonna waste energy on someone who isn’t on the same wavelength. It’s just baffling how he switched up and basically wanted a trad wife, and I’m so happy that I ended that relationship. I’ve decided that I’m done with dating apps afterwords and plan on using dedicated sites now that I feel like I can catch and liar from a mile away.

Trilogy Metals [welcomed](https://trilogymetals.com/news-and-media/news/trilogy-metals-applauds-president-trumps-decision-to-grant-permits-for-the-ambler-access-project-to-enable-the-development-of/) Trump’s decision to grant permits to enable the development of critical minerals in Alaska, saying the Ambler mining district is “home to some of the world’s richest known copper-dominant polymetallic deposits.”

The company said in a statement that Trump’s order, which reverses the Biden administration’s rejection of the Ambler Road project, “reflects a renewed federal commitment to responsible resource development in Alaska and highlights the Ambler Road as critical infrastructure under federal policy.”

It added that the move would help to secure domestic supply chains for minerals including copper, cobalt, zinc and lead, highlighting the importance of these resources in energy infrastructure, defense technologies and manufacturing.

Opponents to the long-debated Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road through the Alaskan wilderness, have said it will harm landscapes that support local communities and wildlife.

# Oct. 6th, 2025~Washington Joins London In A Race For Greenland's Minerals

[Washington Joins London In A Race For Greenland's Minerals - Critical Metals (NASDAQ:CRML) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/25/10/48036691/washington-joins-london-in-a-race-for-greenlands-minerals)

The Trump administration is in talks to take a stake in **Critical Metals Corp** (NASDAQ:[CRML](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CRML)), which would give it a direct interest in Greenland’s largest [rare earth deposit](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities), the **Tanbreez** project.

Four people familiar with the discussions told Reuters that the administration is considering converting a $50 million Defense Production Act grant into an equity investment, marking a potential new front in Washington’s push to secure critical mineral supply chains.

# Something went wrong.

“Hundreds of companies are approaching us trying to get the administration to invest in their critical minerals projects,” a senior Trump administration official said. “There is absolutely nothing close with this company at this time,” the official added, emphasizing that discussions remain preliminary.

Following [stakes](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/25/09/47872716/trumps-mineral-gambit-after-lithium-americas-these-names-could-be-next) in **Lithium Americas** (NYSE:[LAC](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/LAC)) and **MP Materials** (NYSE:[MP](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MP)), such an investment would be the next step for the White House, as it seeks to reduce reliance on Chinese-controlled production and processing.

The Tanbreez deposit, situated in southern Greenland near the town of **Narsaq**, contains approximately 45 million tons of rare-earth-bearing rock. These materials are essential for various technologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, advanced defense systems, and semiconductor components.

President **Donald Trump** has [expressed interest in Greenland](https://europeancapitalinsights.substack.com/p/trump-wants-to-buy-greenland-for) on multiple occasions, famously floating the idea of purchasing the island in 2019 and again earlier this year. While the proposal was widely dismissed, the U.S. has continued to court Greenlandic officials, including through visits by Vice President **JD Vance** earlier this year.

Critical Metals purchased Tanbreez last year for $5 million in cash and $211 million in stock, following the successful encouragement of U.S. officials to the previous owner to reject a higher bid from a Chinese buyer. The mine’s development cost is estimated at $290 million, with initial production targeted for 2026.

Once operational, it could produce around 85,000 tons of rare earth concentrate annually, alongside smaller but strategically essential quantities of gallium and tantalum, both minerals that China has recently imposed export restrictions on.

The Trump administration began talks with the firm about six weeks ago, evaluating the conversion of the $50 million grant into equity. As of Friday’s close, Critical Metals had a market cap of around $787 million, which would translate to about a 6.3% stake in the company, although the final structure remains uncertain. The discussions are separate from a proposed $120 million loan package under consideration by the U.S. Export-Import Bank to fund early-stage development work at Tanbreez.

The interest in Greenland’s resources is a global matter. Britain has also been deepening its engagement with Greenland. Politico [reported](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-greenland-critical-minerals-deal-partnership/) that the UK government reopened free talks with the island, seeking closer cooperation on critical minerals. British companies hold roughly one-third of Greenland’s mining licenses.

**Momentum narrative:**

* **Munich** → **Washington hand-off** is *ceremonial and catalytic*. Mark Smith while attending the Munich event publicly called Elk Creek a **“U.S. National Security Asset,”** **a phrase that now justifies Pentagon-level sourcing authority under the 2024 NDAA.**
* **The J.P. Morgan Forum** is the *policy-capital bridge*: EXIM, DFC, and DoD liaisons attend. Expect subtle signaling—phrases like “strategic alignment,” “domestic independence,” or “pilot alloy qualification”—to light the fuse.

*NioCorp also to present at the Critical Minerals Forum Summit in Washington, D.C. on October 8, 2025 at 11:05 AM ET*

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (October 2, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**“) (**Nasdaq: NB**), is pleased to announce that Executive Chairman and CEO Mark Smith will participate in the J.P. Morgan Export & Agency Finance Forum on October 8, 2025 at the Place Vendôme in Paris, France.

Mr. Smith will take part in the *Resources: Onshoring the Value Chain* roundtable at 11:45 a.m. local time, joining other executives and industry leaders to discuss strategies for strengthening U.S. supply chains. He will highlight the [**Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project**](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)’s potential to help reshore U.S. production of certain critical minerals, specifically niobium, scandium, titanium, and potentially magnetic rare earth elements.

# Tomorrow ~ Washington, D.C. Takes the Baton — JP Morgan Critical Minerals Forum (Oct 8)

**IMHO -** Washington now takes the helm! Tomorrow on **October 8, 2025 (11:05 AM ET)**, NioCorp CEO **Mark Smith** steps onto the stage at **J.P. Morgan’s Export Agency Finance Forum** — the exact arena where **policy meets capital**. The hand-off from Munich to D.C. is both **ceremonial and catalytic**: in Germany, Smith made headlines by declaring **Elk Creek a “U.S. National Security Asset,”** underscoring its central role in restoring domestic control over critical mineral supply chains.

Following a **huge surge Friday Oct. 3, 2025** and early Monday acceleration toward **$9**, markets are clearly front-running the next phase. Institutional desks and defense-industry insiders alike are tracking the trifecta ahead — **mid-October drill data**, the **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)**, and **scandium alloy validation under DoD oversight**. Every lever is being primed.

**⚙️ The Four-Metal Convergence — America’s New Industrial Backbone**

NioCorp’s alignment with U.S. industrial and defense strategy is now unmistakable:

* **Niobium** — the backbone of hypersonic alloys and superconducting magnets; an irreplaceable input for next-gen defense metallurgy.
* **Titanium & TiCl₄** — the domestic reboot of the jet-age supply chain, from engine housings to armor coatings.
* **Scandium & Sc-Al Alloys** — the **Gen VI leap**: ultra-light, ultra-strong alloys redefining fighters, drones, and orbital systems. The **DoD demonstration milestone in November** will mark the **first U.S.-sourced scandium metal of the century.**
* **REEs (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb)** — the permanent-magnet feedstock powering the **F-35**, naval propulsion, and EV platforms.

All four are embedded in **DOE, USGS, and 2024 NDAA** critical-mineral frameworks — unlocking **funding mandates, stockpile authorizations, and long-term sourcing guarantees.** This is the **titanium playbook reborn** — the same model that built an entire industry from scratch in the 1950s, now re-applied to scandium, niobium, and REEs.

**🔥 Q4 Ignition Sequence — Policy • Geology • Finance Converge**

The ignition stack is now fully synchronized. **EXIM and DFC funding frameworks** are aligning with **DoD equity positioning, Maxim’s $12 target, and prime-contractor offtake interest.** Mid-October drill results are expected to confirm **resource expansion toward 1,000,000 tonnes TREO**, feeding into the **Q4 DFS** that finalizes **capex, opex, NPV, and RailVeyor efficiencies.** Meanwhile, **Apex’s land expansion beside Elk Creek** cements district-scale validation — where deep geology meets deep capital.

With **scandium alloy demonstration imminent** and **policy alignment locked in**, NioCorp’s **Elk Creek Project** now stands as the **control node of America’s critical-minerals reboot.** As Washington convenes under **J.P. Morgan’s** banner, the message is unmistakable:

# Elk Creek as a “U.S. National Security Asset"" moment has arrived — and the ignition window is wide open. 🛰️⚡

Viktorija’s concept was simple yet heartfelt: To capture that nostalgic, handmade Christmas spirit from our childhoods, when evenings were spent at the kitchen table cutting paper snowflakes and making garlands, our fingers sticky with glue but our hearts full of joy.

Each illustration was first drawn by hand, then brought to life using a Risograph, a retro-printing technique that combines the charm of screen printing with the mechanical soul of an 80s copy machine.

She seems very upset and agitated when we go to visit. She has started to do a thing where she writes a list for my husband and I when we come visit as we like to help her on weekends with tasks. It's been getting harder as she seems hyper fixated on small things that she can be very stubborn about  but she's also forgetting some things we've done, I think.

For example she bought a shower curtain liner not long ago ago. (Maybe 2 visit ago?!) and helped her install it. This weekend when we went over she had bought another one and wants it on, but we had just replaced the other one and I don't think she remembers. She just says it has soap on the bottom and wants the new one on..

She has a keurig coffee maker and the light for descaling is on. We've done the descaling process on it twice but for whatever reason the descaling light won't stop blinking so she thinks something is wrong. We tried explaining we fixed it already 

So she went out and bought some huge bottle of descaling solution and says she is going to do this (this takes hours, we've done it). We tried to explain that it's just the light but she keeps insisting it needs to be done...

She was complaining her lamp lightbulb broke as it only clicks between 2 light settings and its supposed to be a tri lightbulb. She wanted us to do a separate trip to find a new lightbulb and drive her there. We ended up finding she had a spare lightbulb so we fixed it. She now says that she wants us to switch her 2 lamps because one is brighter than the other one

We try to do what we can.. When we visit. We are helping where we can. I guess I'm just venting. She also has a daughter who lives close and cut her off because her mother annoys her (she can be rude and say things that are quite insulting due to the cognitive issues she's having). 

At this point sometimes I'm wondering if we just buy MIL a whole new keurig (she doesn't have much money, we're tight on money too.) it wouldn't really fix the problem as she would just find another problem..

With the things she fixates on... Sometimes we try to change the subject etc. She's started writing things down, I think so she remembers all these things she needs fixing and she kind of fixates on that

She calls my husband every single night. One night he was tired and went to bed and she had a big fit, leaving several voicemails then calling me too. She gets upset and starts crying. Sometimes we need a night off and have just sent a text saying we are tired and will call the next day. It's getting to be a lot..

We planned a casual day out — met around 2pm, wandered around some shops, grabbed lunch, had coffee, and he dropped me home around 6:30pm.

He came across confident and relaxed, but in a grounded way. At one point, we had a staring competition at a red light — he stared into my eyes and laughed when I didn’t break eye contact, saying, “Wow, you’ve got such a serious face. That’s how I want you to be when other guys try to approach you.” While walking, he subtly guided me with his hand on my back or arm, opened doors, just little things that made him seem attentive. He was playful too, joking things like, “Next time I’m doing your makeup.”

When we sat down to eat, I noticed he went quiet for a bit — kind of looked deep in thought and avoided eye contact. Then, after we finished, he told me he had something important he hadn’t mentioned before… and that’s when he said he has two kids. I was shocked and didn’t really know how to respond at first. He explained he hadn’t told me earlier because he didn’t want to risk me not meeting him and seeing past it. It took me a moment to process, but I respected that he told me face-to-face instead of hiding it.

At the end of the date, he hugged me and said, “I’ll see you soon — you better not be talking to any other guys,” and also mentioned that he really enjoyed himself. It genuinely felt like he meant it.

Now it’s the next morning (around 10am) and… nothing. No text, no “had a good time,” nothing. I’m trying not to spiral or overthink it, but I keep wondering if I should just wait for him to reach out or text him first.

Do I wait out or take the first step? What if he wasn’t into me?

TL;DR: Went on a great first date with a guy I’ve been talking to, he was flirty and attentive, dropped a bombshell that he has two kids, hugged me goodbye, and now it’s the next morning and I haven’t heard from him.

My sister (27F) and I are really close. We see each other once or twice a week, sometimes for coffee, sometimes just to walk our dogs together. My boyfriend, who I’ve been dating for a little over a year, thinks it’s “too much.”

He said he doesn’t understand how two adult women can spend that much time together, and that it makes him feel “left out” when I’d rather do things with her. For example, last weekend he invited me to a brewery event with his friends, but I had already promised my sister we’d go thrift shopping. He got moody the entire night and said I was “choosing her over him.”

The thing is… my sister has been in my life forever. She’s my best friend, and I don’t see anything wrong with wanting to spend time with her. My boyfriend says he feels like he’ll always be in second place and that he shouldn’t have to “compete with my sister.”

I really do like him and want this relationship to work, but this feels like such a weird thing for him to be jealous over. Is this something I should be concerned about long-term?",6,1759829665.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

How do I deal with my mom? I'm a female in my early 20's. I've noticed na very conditional yung pagmamahal ng mom ko sakin. When I have money, she's very sweet towards me. Pag wala naman, she is very passive aggressive and sobrang insensitive. I've been unemployed for 2 months na po, (ofc still trying hard to secure a new job) and she has been constantly talking about me to other people, telling very exaggerated statements na wala akong plano sa buhay at wala akong purpose along with other actual nastier insults. Sometimes naririnig ko siya openly laughing after mocking me. Mind you, before I lost my job I was always very generous to her, I would treat her to spa days and pay for whatever she wanted to get done sa salon. I would take her out to eat frequently. I would pay the bills. Pag kailangan niya nang extra money I would hand her more than what she needed. I do freelance work, when the money is good, it's really good, ofc there are times na walang available projects and there would be windows where wala akong income for a few weeks. Within those weeks, it's like may switch na pumapalong and suddenly walang pake yung mom ko. When I get projects again, babalik siya in being the sweet and loving mom. This has been the longest that I've been unemployed and sobrang down ako sa sarili ko. Ever since I been broke my mom started hiding food from me. At first I knew it was petty pero ngayon it has really started to make me depressed. Outside of the mandatory lunch and dinner, I don't eat anything else dahil she makes me feel like wala akong karapatan kumain. Whether it would be coffee or snacks, tinatago niya. Masakit. I noticed that pumayat ako and I don't mind that part. I don't crave for food anymore kasi I can’t afford it for now. Alam ko temporary lang to na phase sa buhay ko and I won’t be down forever pero knowing na ganito yung mom ko makes me so sad and demotivated. I know myself pero her words are starting to make me feel like maybe tama siya in saying wala akong kwenta. I've never been the confrontational type, ayaw ko nang any form of argument. Pero sometimes I feel like sasabog na ako. I don't know what to do.

1o09zp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1o09zp3/how_to_connect_nordvpn_on_iphone/,How To Connect NordVPN On iPhone,"Checking your email at a coffee shop. Banking on airport WiFi. Browsing on the train. Your iPhone connects to dozens of networks every week—and each one is a potential security risk. Without protection, anyone on the same network can potentially monitor your traffic, steal your data, or track your online activities.

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making it virtually impossible for snoopers to see what you're doing online. But if you've never set up a VPN before, the process might seem intimidating. Don't worry—connecting NordVPN on your iPhone takes just a few minutes, and this guide will walk you through every step.

# Why Use NordVPN on Your iPhone?

Before we dive into the setup process, let's quickly cover why protecting your iPhone with a VPN matters:

**Public WiFi is inherently insecure.** When you connect to public networks, cybercriminals can intercept your data using techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks. A VPN encrypts all your traffic, making it unreadable to anyone trying to snoop.

**Your ISP tracks your browsing activity.** Internet service providers can see every website you visit and may sell this data to advertisers. With NordVPN active, your ISP only sees encrypted data—they can't monitor which sites you're accessing.

**Geo-restrictions limit your content access.** Many streaming services and websites restrict content based on your location. By connecting to NordVPN's 7,000+ servers across 165 countries, you can access content from different regions securely.

**Mobile devices are increasingly targeted.** According to recent cybersecurity reports, mobile malware attacks increased by 54% in 2024. NordVPN's Threat Protection feature blocks malicious websites and ads before they can harm your device.

# What You Need Before You Start

Before connecting NordVPN on your iPhone, make sure you have:

* **An iPhone running iOS 16.0 or later** \- You can check your iOS version by going to Settings > General > About
* **An active NordVPN subscription** \- If you haven't subscribed yet, you can sign up through the NordVPN website
* **A stable internet connection** \- Connect to WiFi or cellular data before setting up the VPN
* **App Store access** \- You'll need to download the official NordVPN app (free download, subscription required to use)

# How To Connect NordVPN on iPhone: Step-by-Step Guide

# Step 1: Download NordVPN from the App Store

**Open the App Store** on your iPhone and tap the search icon at the bottom of the screen. Type ""NordVPN"" in the search bar and tap the official NordVPN app (look for the shield icon and ""Nordvpn S.A."" as the developer).

**Tap ""Get""** or the cloud download icon if you've downloaded it before. You may need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or your Apple ID password. The app is free to download, though you'll need a subscription to actually use it.

**Important note:** In some countries with VPN restrictions, NordVPN may not appear in the App Store. If this happens, you'll need to create a new Apple ID registered in a country without VPN restrictions (such as the United States) to download the app.

# Step 2: Sign In or Create an Account

Once the download completes, **tap ""Open""** to launch the NordVPN app for the first time.

The app will ask if you want to register a new account or log in. If you already purchased a NordVPN subscription, **tap ""Log in""** at the bottom of the screen. If you haven't subscribed yet, **tap ""Sign up""** to create a new account—you can complete the subscription process directly through the app.

**Enter your credentials** carefully. Your username is typically the email address you used to sign up, though NordVPN also provides special service credentials for manual setups. If you're unsure of your login details, you can find them in your Nord Account dashboard at my.nordaccount.com.

# Step 3: Grant VPN Profile Permissions

This is the most important step where many users get confused. When you first try to connect to NordVPN, iOS will display a permission request asking to **""Add VPN Configurations.""**

**This is completely normal and necessary.** iOS requires explicit permission before any VPN app can create the encrypted tunnel that protects your data. Without this permission, the VPN simply cannot function.

**Tap ""Allow""** when the prompt appears. Depending on your iPhone's security settings, you may need to:

* Enter your device passcode
* Authenticate with Touch ID (if you have an iPhone with a home button)
* Authenticate with Face ID (if you have a newer iPhone)

This permission only needs to be granted once. After this initial setup, NordVPN can connect automatically without requiring additional approval.

# Step 4: Connect to a Server

Now you're ready to protect your connection. NordVPN offers two ways to connect:

**Quick Connect (Recommended for Beginners)**

The simplest method is to **tap the large ""Quick Connect"" button** on the main screen. NordVPN's algorithm will automatically select the fastest available server based on your current location and network conditions. This typically takes 3-5 seconds.

You'll know you're connected when:

* The button changes to ""Disconnect""
* A small VPN icon appears in your iPhone's status bar at the top of the screen
* The app displays ""You are protected"" with the server location

**Manual Server Selection (For Specific Needs)**

If you need to connect to a specific country (for example, to access content from a particular region), **tap the country list** at the bottom of the app. You can:

* **Browse by region** \- Scroll through the alphabetical list of countries
* **Use the search bar** \- Type the country name to quickly find it
* **View server details** \- Some countries have multiple cities available; tap the arrow next to a country to see all options

**Tap any server** to connect. NordVPN will switch your connection to that location within seconds.

# Step 5: Verify Your Connection

After connecting, it's good practice to verify your VPN is actually working properly. Here's how:

**Check your IP address.** While still connected to NordVPN, open Safari and visit a site like whatismyipaddress.com or ipleak.net. The displayed IP address should match the server location you connected to—not your real IP address or location.

**Look for the VPN status icon.** Check the top of your iPhone screen. You should see a small ""VPN"" indicator next to your cellular signal or WiFi icon. This confirms iOS recognizes an active VPN connection.

**Test the Kill Switch (Advanced).** NordVPN's Kill Switch prevents data leaks if your VPN connection drops. To enable it, open the NordVPN app, tap the profile icon, go to Settings, and toggle on ""Kill Switch"" under VPN Connection settings.

# How To Customize Your NordVPN Settings

NordVPN offers several settings that can enhance your iPhone experience:

**Auto-Connect**

Navigate to **Settings > VPN Connection > Auto-connect** to set NordVPN to automatically connect when you join specific networks. This is especially useful for automatically protecting your connection on public WiFi networks.

**Protocol Selection**

Go to **Settings > VPN Connection > Protocol** to choose your connection protocol:

* **NordLynx (Recommended)** \- NordVPN's proprietary protocol based on WireGuard. Provides the fastest speeds while maintaining strong security.
* **OpenVPN (UDP)** \- Good balance of speed and security. UDP is faster but occasionally less reliable.
* **OpenVPN (TCP)** \- More stable than UDP but slightly slower. Best for unstable networks.
* **IKEv2/IPSec** \- Fast and stable, good for mobile devices that frequently switch networks.

For most users, NordLynx provides the best experience on iPhone.

**Threat Protection**

**Tap Settings > Threat Protection** to enable this feature, which blocks malicious websites, ads, and trackers. Note that Threat Protection only works when the VPN is actively connected.

**Siri Shortcuts**

NordVPN supports Siri integration. Go to **Settings > Siri Shortcuts** to create custom voice commands like ""Hey Siri, turn on my VPN"" for hands-free protection.

# Common Connection Issues and How To Fix Them

Even with a straightforward setup, you might encounter some issues. Here are the most common problems and their solutions:

# ""Connection Failed"" or ""Connecting Takes Too Long""

**Try these fixes in order:**

1. **Force close and relaunch the app.** Swipe up from the bottom of your screen (or double-click the home button on older iPhones), swipe up on the NordVPN app to close it completely, then reopen it from your home screen.
2. **Try a different server.** The server you're attempting to connect to might be experiencing issues. Manually select a different country or use Quick Connect to let the app choose an alternative.
3. **Switch protocols.** Go to Settings > Protocol and try connecting with each available protocol. Different networks work better with different protocols.
4. **Check your internet connection.** Disconnect from the VPN and try loading a website in Safari. If pages won't load, the issue is with your internet connection, not NordVPN.

# Authentication Failed or Login Issues

If you're getting authentication errors:

1. **Verify your credentials are correct.** Double-check for typos, especially if you're copy-pasting. Make sure caps lock isn't accidentally enabled.
2. **Reset your password.** Visit the NordVPN website to reset your password if you've forgotten it or suspect it might be incorrect.
3. **Check your subscription status.** Log into your Nord Account at my.nordaccount.com to ensure your subscription is active and hasn't expired.

# Connection Keeps Dropping

Frequent disconnections are frustrating but usually fixable:

1. **Enable the Kill Switch.** This ensures your data stays protected even if the VPN connection drops temporarily. Go to Settings > VPN Connection > Kill Switch.
2. **Disable iCloud Private Relay.** Apple's Private Relay feature can conflict with VPN connections. Go to your iPhone Settings > \[Your Name\] > iCloud > Private Relay and turn it off.
3. **Reset network settings.** If other solutions don't work, go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings. **Warning:** This will delete saved WiFi passwords, so make sure you have them saved elsewhere.
4. **Update iOS and the app.** Make sure you're running the latest version of both iOS and the NordVPN app. Updates often include bug fixes for connection issues.

# Can't Find NordVPN in the App Store

If the NordVPN app doesn't appear in your App Store:

1. **Your region may restrict VPN apps.** Some countries block VPN apps from appearing in their App Stores. You'll need to create a new Apple ID registered in a country without restrictions.
2. **Sign out of your current Apple ID** in the App Store, then sign in with the new ID to access and download NordVPN.
3. **After installation, you can switch back** to your original Apple ID—the app will remain installed and functional.

# Slow Connection Speeds

VPNs add a small amount of overhead due to encryption, but significant slowdowns aren't normal:

1. **Connect to a nearby server.** The farther away the server, the higher the latency. Choose a server close to your physical location for the best speeds.
2. **Use NordLynx protocol.** This protocol is optimized for speed. Go to Settings > Protocol and select NordLynx.
3. **Check for server congestion.** During peak hours, popular servers may slow down. Try connecting to a different server in the same country.
4. **Test your base connection speed.** Disconnect the VPN and run a speed test. If your regular connection is slow, the VPN won't make it faster—it can only work with the speed your ISP provides.

# Best Practices for Using NordVPN on iPhone

To get the most out of NordVPN while maintaining optimal iPhone performance:

**Enable Auto-Connect for Untrusted Networks**

Set up Auto-Connect to automatically protect you on public WiFi. This way, you'll never accidentally expose your data at coffee shops, hotels, or airports. You can configure specific networks to always trigger the VPN.

**Keep Your App Updated**

NordVPN regularly releases updates with security improvements, new features, and bug fixes. Enable automatic updates in the App Store settings to always have the latest version.

**Use Split Tunneling When Needed**

Note that as of 2025, iOS doesn't support split tunneling (the ability to route some apps through the VPN while others use your regular connection). This is an iOS limitation, not a NordVPN one. Android users have this feature, but iPhone users must route all traffic through the VPN when connected.

**Monitor Your Battery Life**

VPNs require some additional processing power for encryption, which can impact battery life. If battery drain becomes noticeable:

* Disconnect when you don't need protection (like when you're at home on your trusted network)
* Use the NordLynx protocol, which is more battery-efficient than older protocols
* Consider carrying a portable charger if you need all-day VPN protection

**Don't Use Multiple VPNs Simultaneously**

Running two VPN apps at once will cause conflicts and connection failures. If you have other VPN apps installed, make sure only NordVPN is active when you want to use it.

# Advanced Features Worth Exploring

Once you're comfortable with basic usage, NordVPN offers several advanced features:

**Dark Web Monitor**

This feature scans dark web databases to check if your email addresses or credentials have been compromised in data breaches. You can enable it in the app settings.

**Meshnet**

Create secure connections between your devices or share files securely with trusted contacts. This feature essentially creates your own private network using NordVPN's infrastructure.

**CyberSec/Threat Protection**

Blocks dangerous websites, malware, and intrusive ads automatically. Especially useful for preventing accidental clicks on malicious links.

# When You Might Need Manual Configuration

The NordVPN app handles everything automatically for most users. However, in rare cases, you might need to set up a manual VPN connection:

* **The app isn't working properly** despite troubleshooting
* **You're using a very old iOS version** that isn't supported by the current app
* **You want to use specific advanced configurations** not available in the app

For manual setup using IKEv2/IPSec or OpenVPN, NordVPN provides detailed guides in their support section at support.nordvpn.com. These methods require more technical knowledge and don't include convenient features like Quick Connect or the Kill Switch.

# Understanding What Your VPN Does (and Doesn't Do)

It's important to have realistic expectations about VPN protection:

**What NordVPN Does:**

* Encrypts your internet traffic so ISPs and network administrators can't see your browsing
* Masks your real IP address with the VPN server's IP address
* Protects your data on public WiFi networks
* Helps prevent ISP throttling based on activity
* Blocks malicious websites and ads (with Threat Protection enabled)

**What NordVPN Doesn't Do:**

* Make you completely anonymous online (websites you log into still know who you are)
* Protect you from malware already on your device
* Allow you to download copyrighted content illegally
* Guarantee 100% security (no security measure is foolproof)

# Conclusion: Your iPhone Deserves Better Protection

Setting up NordVPN on your iPhone takes less than five minutes but provides ongoing protection for all your mobile internet activity. Whether you're checking email at Starbucks, shopping online at the airport, or streaming content at home, your encrypted connection keeps your data private and secure.

The process is straightforward: download the app, sign in, grant VPN permissions, and connect. If you encounter issues, the troubleshooting steps in this guide should resolve most common problems quickly.

**Take action now:** If you haven't already, download NordVPN from the App Store and follow the steps in this guide to set it up. Your digital privacy is too important to leave unprotected.

For additional help, NordVPN offers 24/7 customer support through live chat at support.nordvpn.com. Their support team can assist with any issues not covered in this guide or provide personalized troubleshooting for complex problems.

I (26M) just really need to get this off my chest, and maybe someone here can say something that helps. For context: I have extremely low self-esteem and social anxiety.

Last Sunday, after she had asked me several times over the past two years, I met up with an old ex-girlfriend from about ten years ago. We went for coffee to talk a bit and catch up on what’s happened in our lives since we last spoke.
That alone was already a huge challenge for me.

But in the end, the whole conversation turned into a long monologue about how she’s currently exploring her sexuality and how many men she’s been seeing lately.

I honestly don’t judge her at all — I’m happy she’s living her life in a way that makes her feel good. But I can’t help comparing myself to her so intensely that it actually makes me feel sick.

In the past ten years, nothing noteworthy has really happened in my life, except for a relationship with an asexual woman. But it’s not just about sex — it’s that, in general, my life has been standing still because I’ve been stuck in my comfort zone for so long.

I know it’s toxic to compare myself to others, but I do it automatically, and I can’t seem to stop. It’s exhausting. I can’t focus on work, I’ve stopped going to the gym, I have no appetite, and I constantly feel nauseous from all the overthinking.

Now this ex wants to build a friendship again and keeps texting me more and more. It just makes me feel bad, but I don’t want to tell her to stop opening up to me — she clearly enjoys talking, and it feels selfish to shut that down just because I can’t handle it.

Even if I did set that boundary, it wouldn’t really fix the problem, because I should be learning to deal with situations like this instead of always retreating whenever I feel uncomfortable.

To make things worse, that same asexual ex invited me to her birthday this weekend — there will be lots of people I don’t know. I want to go because I’d like to see her again, but I’m already terrified. I’m scared it’ll trigger me even worse than the meetup on Sunday did, because I dont know on what terms we would even be if we met.
And since it’s far away and I’d have to stay overnight, there’s no easy escape.

Sorry for the long post, but I just feel so hopeless and worthless right now.

1o09nqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1o09nqy/find_out_if_mac_lustre_lipstick_hug_me_truly/,Find Out If MAC Lustre Lipstick Hug Me Truly Flatters Everyone,"Testing out the MAC TRTAZ11A lipstick has been quite an interesting experience. Known as the Lustre Lipstick in the shade ""HUG ME,"" it promised a neutral flesh pink color with a lustrous sheen. Having used it daily for several weeks, I can confidently say there’s a lot to unpack, from its versatility to a few minor quirks.

**Packaging and Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek, iconic design of the lipstick tube. M.A.C. always nails sophisticated minimalism, and this product is no exception. It feels premium in my hand, with just the right weight to make it feel sturdy but not bulky. The simple black and silver combination screams elegance without trying too hard. It fits neatly in my makeup pouch without any concerns about the cap coming off and causing mid-day horror stories. Plus, the compact size ensures portability, something I absolutely look for in any lip product.  

**Color and Finish**  
The color is what really made this a standout for me. Neutral flesh pink sounds simple, but it's actually quite nuanced. On my lips, it created this “my lips but better” effect, a polished, natural look that works perfectly for office days and casual outings. The Lustre finish adds just a hint of sheen, striking a balance between matte and glossy. It’s subtle, not shiny, making it sophisticated and understated while still adding a touch of glamour.  

[Check MAC TRTAZ11A price on Amazon.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b00l6ku1f2/)

**Ease of Application and Texture**  
Let’s talk application. The creamy texture glides on beautifully, and it doesn’t tug or drag on the lips. The formula is easy to layer, but even one swipe delivers decent pigmentation. On days when I’m rushing out the door, this lipstick proves to be a no-fuss addition to my routine. I’ve also layered it over lip liner for a more defined look, and it performed consistently well.  

**Wearability and Comfort**  
Comfort is where this lipstick scores some major points. Unlike some lipsticks that leave my lips feeling dry or tight after a few hours, this one keeps them feeling hydrated, almost balm-like. That said, it’s not entirely transfer-proof. You’ll notice traces on your coffee mug, but it fades gracefully and leaves behind a soft tint. The staying power isn’t long-lasting, averaging around three to four hours without touch-ups. For someone like me who doesn’t mind reapplying, that’s not a dealbreaker.  

**Good Aspects**  
- The universally flattering pink shade works well on multiple skin tones.  
- Creamy and lightweight texture is super comfortable for daily wear.  
- Lustre finish elevates the look without being overly dramatic.  
- Versatile enough to pair with casual, professional, or formal makeup looks.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited staying power means frequent touch-ups are necessary.  
- It’s not transfer-proof, which some may find inconvenient.  
- A bigger color payoff might appeal to those who prefer bold lipsticks.  

**Product Rivals**  
When comparing this lipstick to some of its competitors, such as the Maybelline Color Sensational series or the Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Volupté Shine, the MAC TRTAZ11A strikes a balance between high-end and everyday usability. The YSL Rouge offers a more luxurious feel and packaging, while the Maybelline lipsticks are more budget-friendly but less refined in shade versatility. The Lustre finish is where this MAC lipstick truly shines, as it offers a more sophisticated sheen that stands out compared to the sometimes overly glossy finishes of similar products.  

**Value for Money**  
While this lipstick leans toward the pricier side, it does bring quality and sophistication, justifying the cost for someone who values a polished, neutral look. It serves as a versatile day-to-night option, saving you the trouble of switching lip colors throughout the day. If you’re into investing in makeup that feels luxurious yet practical, this lipstick fits the bill. For those who prioritize affordability, however, options like Revlon or L’Oréal might be more inviting.

One night during finals week, I was “studying” - which in my case meant staring at my laptop, surrounded by three empty coffee mugs, and convincing myself that reorganizing my desk counted as productivity.

I ordered from a roaster on the 1st, and were delivered on the 4th. On all the bags it has stamped with a future roast date (6th). 
One actually has 5th and restamped ontop 6th.

I queried twice different formats to the roaster regarding the query of why there's a future roast date, of which I was met with response.

""we had an error with the date stamps on the 4th. the correct date is the 1st (we pack orders the day they're ordered) but production team stamped the bags as 6th""

My concern is if issue was the 4th, the bags got delivered on the 4th, and I ordered the 1st so it shouldn't of ever been part of the date stamps issue firstly, secondly as stated you put a mistake for 6th which is a week later but on one the bags you've doubled stamp mistaked 5th then re stamped ontop 6th.

Not because I didn’t enjoy late-night pizza or pretending to follow my econ professor’s TED Talk impersonations but because I was finally going to start adulting. No more living off instant noodles and group projects. I was ready to earn, save, and build my own little empire.

Then reality hit me like a student loan statement: furniture costs money. A lot of it.  
And if you’re furnishing your first place, it’s easy to end up with an empty room, a sad futon, and a milk crate “coffee table.”

So, in the spirit of saving you from repeating my mistakes, here’s how to furnish your entire apartment *like an adult on a budget*.

# The Kitchen

Let’s be honest most first apartments come with exactly one thing in the kitchen: regret. But you’ll need a few basics to survive.

# Pots & Pans

Skip the fancy 10-piece sets. You only need:

* 1 small pot
* 1 medium pot
* 1 large pot
* 2 nonstick pans (small + medium)

If you buy these secondhand or from Walmart/IKEA, expect to spend around **$40–$50 total**.

# Dishes & Utensils

Start minimal:

* 4 plates
* 4 bowls
* 4 glasses
* 4 mugs
* Basic silverware set

Grab a few kitchen tools (spatula, ladle, can opener) from the dollar store.  
**Total: \~$35–$40**

# The Extras (Optional)

* Coffee maker or kettle: \~$25
* Strainer, chopping board, and storage jars: \~$15

**Kitchen Total: \~$100**

# The Bathroom

This one’s easy. It’s not glamorous, but it needs to function.

* Towels: $25
* Shower curtain + rings: $10
* Trash can: $10
* Toilet brush + plunger: $20
* Bathmat: $15

**Bathroom Total: \~$80**

# The Living Room

This is where your friends will silently judge your furniture choices. Let’s make it look decent.

* Couch or loveseat: $150
* Coffee table: $30
* Two end tables: $40
* Two lamps: $30
* Dining table (seats 4): $120
* TV stand: $40
* TV (32–40” smart): $250

You can easily find used couches and tables on Facebook Marketplace or thrift stores.  
**Living Room Total: \~$660**

# The Bedroom

AKA the room where comfort actually matters.

* Memory foam mattress (queen): $300
* Bed frame: $70
* Two nightstands: $100
* Dresser: $80

If your parents have old furniture, grab it. They’ll probably be thrilled to get rid of it.  
**Bedroom Total: \~$550**

# The Office (if you’re lucky enough to have space)

Working from home? You’ll need a few basics.

* Desk: $60
* Chair: $40
* Printer (optional): $100

**Office Total: \~$200**

# Decor (aka “Stuff That Makes It Look Like You Tried”)

This is the part that transforms your apartment from “guy-who-just-moved-in” to “functional adult.”

* Wall art or prints: $30
* Small decor/plants: $50
* Picture frames: $20

Thrift stores and clearance bins are gold mines for this stuff.  
**Decor Total: \~$100**

# The Final Bill

|Room|Estimated Total|
|:-|:-|
|Kitchen|$100|
|Bathroom|$80|
|Living Room|$660|
|Bedroom|$550|
|Office|$200|
|Decor|$100|
|**Grand Total**|**≈ $1,690**|

Yep around **$1,700** to furnish an entire one-bedroom apartment. And honestly, that’s not bad when one designer couch can cost more than your whole setup.

# What I Learned the Hard Way

1. **Used ≠ Gross.** Thrift stores, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace are full of good stuff if you take five minutes to inspect it.
2. **Ask family first.** Parents love when you “help them declutter.” Translation: free furniture.
3. **Buy in phases.** You don’t need everything day one. Get the essentials first.
4. **Prioritize comfort.** You can survive with a cheap coffee table, but not a bad mattress.
5. **Budget for surprises.** Something *always* breaks, doesn’t fit, or needs replacing.",1,1759827914.0,CheapButGood,0,1.0,False

1o09mij,https://www.reddit.com/r/PilipinasVolleyball/comments/1o09mij/another_brewing_war_between_pvl_and_pnvf/,Another brewing war between PVL and PNVF,"Just when fans, teams and foreign reinforcements were set for an explosive edition of the Premier Volleyball League (PVL) Reinforced Conference, the league has been forced to keep its guest players off the court – all due to the Philippine National Volleyball Federation’s refusal to endorse the International Transfer Certificates (ITCs) required for foreign imports to compete.

In a statement, PVL organizer Sports Vision expressed its deep frustration over what it described as “unprofessional” and “obstructionist” behavior by the national federation. Despite the timely submission of all documentation, including signed clearances from the players, their respective federations and PVL clubs, the PNVF has withheld the final endorsement necessary for the foreign athletes to take the floor.

“The PVL regrets to inform the public that the foreign guest players will not be permitted to participate in the ongoing season-ending conference until their ITCs are duly approved,” said Sports Vision.

This delay not only disrupts the tournament's competitive integrity but also jeopardizes the careers and contracts of professional players who traveled to the Philippines in good faith. The PVL stressed that it remains committed to following international volleyball protocols and upholding the integrity of the sport, even as the impasse places both players and fans in limbo.

“We respectfully urge the PNVF to expedite the signing process to prevent further disruption to the tournament,” the statement added.

But sources close to the situation reveal that the impasse is far from procedural. According to insiders, the PNVF is leveraging the ITC approval as a bargaining chip to force the PVL to adjust its conference schedule, allegedly to accommodate national team preparations for the upcoming Southeast Asian Games in Thailand.

The PNVF reportedly demanded that the Reinforced Conference end by Nov. 16, despite the PVL having already structured the tournament to run until Nov. 27, including the finals. PVL officials said they had previously adjusted their calendar to support the national program – even moving the conference to begin after the national team's commitments were scheduled to end by September 30.

“Preparations have been made in good faith based on the schedule given to us. But then, at the last minute, the PNVF changed the terms,” said a league official.
“Is the PVL composed only of players in the national team? What happens to the rest of Philippine volleyball – to its growth, to its fans, to the professional clubs – if all PNVF programs are implemented unilaterally and disruptively?”

The fallout from the ITC issue has forced the PVL to launch its Reinforced Conference with an all-Filipino lineup, robbing fans of the spectacle of top-notch imports – a hallmark of the reinforced format.

Opening-day matches at the Ynares Center in Montalban featured ZUS Coffee versus Akari and Capital1 squaring off with Choco Mucho, with all-Pinoy rosters in play.

League officials and stakeholders are now openly questioning the effectiveness and motives of the PNVF, accusing it of prioritizing political control over the development of the sport. While the federation is tasked with advancing Philippine volleyball, critics say its recent actions have instead alienated stakeholders, stunted progress and undermined professional league operations.

“What real contribution has the PNVF made to the growth of volleyball in the country? Aside from asserting authority and taking credit for the achievements of others, what lasting legacy are they building?” another official asked.

The standoff has once again highlighted a deepening rift between the sport’s governing body and its most successful professsional league – a clash that continues to divide volleyball fans and threatens to derail the sport’s momentum in the Philippines.

As of press time, the PNVF has yet to release an official statement explaining its refusal to endorse the ITCs.

Funny enough, I’ve realized that sometimes the simplest things — like a great pair of warm, high-quality socks — can mean a lot. My parents love spending winter evenings by the fireplace, so cozy socks might actually be perfect!

I’m also thinking about pairing them with something small but meaningful — maybe a handwritten note, a favorite coffee blend, or a framed family photo. It doesn’t have to be expensive, just genuine.

What about you all? Have you ever gifted something simple, like socks, that turned out to be surprisingly appreciated? Would love to hear creative twists or sentimental ideas that made your parents’ holidays special!",1,1759827400.0,NewsUpdatesbyRedditor,1,1.0,False

1o09eia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o09eia,What is this bump on roof of mouth? please help,"Hi there, made a throwaway for this cause it feels like a very vulnerable thing to share. Does anyone know what this is or what I should do. 

I do not drink or smoke
Did used to smoke- now occasionally vape (bad I know) 
Drink a lot of tea and coffee 
Am autistic with severe sensory issues 
Have very little experience with dentists as my parents couldn’t afford+didn’t care to take me as a kid and the few times I have been it’s been too overwhelming to handle (even just leaving the house is a huge struggle currently)

This bump appeared about 10 hours ago which I know isn’t very long, but it’s now the morning and I couldn’t sleep at all (literally zero hours of sleep) there is no pain, but I am extremely impacted by change, particularly in sensations and when it’s my body I can’t take time away to recover (hope that makes sense)

I did email my old dentist which I last saw 2 years ago (had a support worker help me book an appointment but my support worker and occupational therapist both quit around the same time and I’ve been in some weird limbo for a while now where I am waiting for more support so I can access things like the dentist, doctor, etc. (This is hard to explain but hope that makes sense) Not even sure if Im still registered with that dentist or not

Im going to be honest, I don’t brush, floss or use mouthwash as often as I should and don’t really take the best care of myself in general. I’m working on improving that but I’m basically just trying to survive each day at the moment.

Basically, this really worries me because
1. Even if it’s a small thing that means nothing, I know this will impact me a lot (already has in the short time it’s been here, not sure I’ll be able to eat, sleep or drink)
2. If it’s serious, I don’t know how to access support. I’m glad I emailed my old dentist, but I’m basically house bound at the moment and don’t know what my options are. I guess I’ll find out 

Because of this, I’m desperately seeking help online cause I’m scared. Sorry, hope that’s alright. I know that understanding what’s going on whether good news or bad will at least help to calm me down because the uncertainty adds to the overwhelm

Shared my autism cause it’s relevant, most people don’t really understand it but I did my best to explain. Im not exaggerating when I’m talking about sensory issues. Please try and understand if possible. 

Thank you for reading, I’d really appreciate any advice or information or even just comfort over this. ",1,1759826959.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

It was one of those mornings where everything felt off — I had a flat tire earlier, spilled coffee on my shirt, and was running late for a client meeting. My patience was thin, and honestly, I just wanted the day to be over.

In front of me was an elderly man, probably in his late 70s, counting change to pay for his coffee and a small sandwich. He was short by about **$5** and looked embarrassed, mumbling something about his “card not working again.”

Normally, I might’ve just waited impatiently, but for some reason that morning — maybe because *my* day already sucked — I handed the cashier my card and said, *“Just add it to mine.”*

The man turned around, surprised, and said, *“Are you sure?”* I just smiled and nodded.

He didn’t just say “thank you.” He reached into his jacket, took out a small coin — a dull silver coin with the words “Lucky Peace Dollar” engraved on it — and handed it to me.

He said, *“My wife gave me this in 1973. She told me it would always remind me that good people exist. I want you to have it.”*

I didn’t know what to say. I tried to give it back, but he refused. He just smiled and said, *“You’ll know when it’s time to pass it on.”*

That coin now sits in my car dashboard. And every time I look at it, I remember — you never know whose bad day you’re turning around with something as small as $5.

1o09cck,https://www.reddit.com/r/RichtechRobotics/comments/1o09cck/the_capybara_report/,The Capybara report,"Hi all,

You might have hard of the Capybara report about RR. Having no clue whether it has substance, I asked Chatgpt Pro to do a ""deep research"" on it. The Chatgpt report is long and nothing original, everyone can get it form Chatgpt, but for the sake of discussion I will copy here below Chatgpt's conclusions. Any thoughts? I am a RR investor myself and I never ignore information sources about the investments I do.

***Conclusion

This investigation finds that many of Capybara Research’s critiques of RR Richtech Robotics are grounded in publicly available evidence. Financial statements confirm stagnant revenue and widening losses, while company announcements about partnerships often involve non‑binding agreements with minimal commitments. The company’s reliance on Chinese suppliers and the similarity of its robots to existing Chinese products suggest that its technology may not be as proprietary as portrayed. Some allegations, particularly those concerning embezzlement or money laundering, lack evidence and should be treated with caution. Overall, investors should critically assess Richtech’s claims, especially around major partnerships and proprietary technology, before making decisions.

In summary, the report confirms Capybara’s key claim that Richtech’s explosive stock rally is not supported by fundamentals. SEC filings reveal revenues slightly declining to US$3.6 million while losses balloon to over US$12 million because administrative costs tripled
sec.gov
. This undercuts the notion that the business is rapidly growing. It also shows the company relies heavily on third-party suppliers, with a non-robotic artificial plant manufacturer and Chinese robotics firm UFactory providing most components
sec.gov
.

The report also finds evidence that some of Richtech’s robots may be rebranded products similar to Pudu’s BellaBot and OrionStar’s Coffee Master
resdiary.com
restauranttechnologynews.com
. While Richtech claims domestic assembly, the similarity and supply chain dependence suggest limited proprietary technology. Allegations of embezzlement could not be substantiated, but the report confirms that major partnerships—such as the Walmart/ Ghost Kitchens deal and a master services agreement with a top retailer—are non-binding and carry no guaranteed revenue
sec.gov
globenewswire.com
. Therefore, Capybara’s accusations of overstated partnerships and customer base are well-supported, whereas its more severe claims about wrongdoing lack public evidence.***",0,1759826737.0,RichtechRobotics,4,0.33,False

Long post ahead 🤷🏻‍♀️ Maganda ito promise. Pang MMK/Magpakailanman. 

Oct 2024 - Ended a 4 year on/off long distance relationship - more of an off relationship than in a relationship. Been on the rocks since 2023. We just needed proper closure. Decision was mutual. 

May 2025 - Girls’ night out. Barkada were pushing me to try dating apps. They even paid for premium memberships. Okay. Let’s try it for a month. Registered to Tinder, Bumble and FB Dating.

May 21 - Met this guy in FB dating - 6 yrs younger (btw 36 here✨) - let’s call him MHN as he introduced himself - a self proclaimed Buddhist (you’ll know later on why), single as he said. Talked over the phone, videocalls, chats - almost everyday with the bare minimum good morning and good night messages. It was fun. Will not lie, but yes I missed reading those chats. But this guy was too fast, like he was in a rush with being in a relationship. 

May 24 - At 3am, made a poem for me. Maybe if I’m on my 20s I’d be head over heels for him - you know, the typical KILIG moment. But since I’ve been on all kinds of relationship, “too good to be true” might be the proper feeling towards it — Copied and pasted each line of the poem, searched in Google, asked ChatGPT for originality of the poem - yes TAMANG HINALA. However, everything seemed legit. Added me on FB and IG. Profiles were both in-synced. Sent me family pictures — ofc I checked on his FB album, same people, PASSED being his family members except for one (later guys, later😎). 

May 25 - Dropped the L word during our convo. Asked him why - he said, “ayaw ko na patagalin, doon din naman pupunta”. It was only our 4th day talking. Possible? For me, NO. For him, YES. Been hearing and reading his ILOVEYOUs all the time. MAHAL KITA most of the time. Even called me, LOVE/MAHAL. Called his attention several times but he just won’t stop. All right — let’s give him the benefit of the doubt. Did I say it back? NO 😅 But that didn’t affect him. Although it was a one-sided feeling that time. This went on for a month. Syempre babae pa rin ako, so medyo may kaunting investment na rin bilang consistent naman sya. But still didn’t call him Love/Mahal and haven’t dropped the L word yet. 

Last week of June - My feelings for him grew a little stronger but I am holding back myself not to show it. I had to because I have to protect my heart. And maybe I hold back myself because we indeed, had an argument about something (too personal to share, sorry ✌🏼). Ang ending, he ghosted me from June 29 - second week of July. YES. You read that right, the guy went MIA. Never read my messages, never replied. Not a single message. And yes, TANGA kasi I didn’t block him. I just unfriended him on FB and unfollowed him on IG. Kept myself busy and distracted. 

July 2 - Went back to dating apps (regular nalang, hindi na premium hehe). Swipe here & there then boom - the MIA guy showed up surprisingly. That was the time na I said, okay - thank you, next. So continued using the dating apps. Met a guy, went on a date but ended up wanting to only be FUBUs - so X. Met another guy, coffee date - FUBU again so X. Another guy, Jollibee date, but then again looking for just FWB so XXX. I was dating once-twice a week. Oh my goodness. These guys are unbelievable. If any of you sees me on any dating apps, I am looking for a real lifetime partner. 36 na ako guys, I don’t have time to play your games. Jusko gusto ko ng pamilya, yung totoong pamilya. FYI lang. Hahaha. 

Last week of July - The typhoon series. Baha almost everywhere. And then this guy who ghosted me suddenly sent me a message saying “ingat ka, malakas ulan, bumabaha” something like that. After one month na hindi nagparamdam, biglang susulpot. So I had to ask - What happened before? Why did he suddenly disappear? Because I believed that I deserved an explanation kahit wala kaming label. Pero wala, the cat got his tongue. “Natakot ako sayo” - Yan lang nasabi nya. “Naduwag ako harapin ka” - Dagdag mo pa ito. He said he didn’t know how to approach me, how to explain himself. And accdg to him, he keeps on thinking about me and wondering how am I doing and if may babalikan pa sya. Nag explain naman sya pero too lame for an excuse talaga. Some days I will reply, some days I won’t. I had to play hard to get para alam ko kung totoo na ba ito na hinahabol ako or naglalaro nanaman si loko. Consistency is the key as people would say. Hala ka, consistent nanaman siya. Hanggang he had me replying all the time again. Oo na sorry na po — bilang the marupok in me kicked-in once again. Welcomed him back with open arms pa ngani - yung parang walang nangyari. Baka kasi nga I’ve fallen for him na nga talaga. So ayun, hanggang August tuloy tuloy nanaman ang chats, calls, videocalls until the Contractors/Floodcontrol issue popped up. Btw, he said he was a civil engineer pala so parang affected din daw sya sa mga bigayan and all. So he had to lie low muna kasi nga super major issue nun lalo sa Senate. Uwi daw muna sya sa Dasma where his parents are staying. But we never stopped exchanging messages and calls. 

August 26 - I finally gave in. He was totally shocked when I dropped the L word. Haha inlove na si tita ninyo. Naks may lovelife na. I thought? Akala ko nga I will be able to say “and the rest was history”. But now I AM TELLING HIS STORY. Pero before yun, syempre inlove inlove muna kami. Naging regular yung pagsabi ng ILOVEYOU. Mas madalas sa palagi yung convo. Pagbigyan niyo na si auntie nyo kasi hanggang September 25 nalang ito. Hehe. So August 26 - September 21, we were more than okay, we were good. 

September 21 - THE RALLY. He said he participated that day. He even shared an FB story. Ofc naniwala ako. At 7pm kauuwi lang daw nya and pagod sya, masakit ang paa. I did not ask him anything. All I said was “Pahinga ka na, kwentuhan mo ako bukas”. 

September 22 - NOT A SINGLE WORD FROM HIM. 

September 23 - “Mahal…” is all he can say. Told him “Akala ko nasa rally ka pa”. Then the argument began again. He kept saying sorry. Too much happenings daw since the rally. Daming ganap. All sorts of excuses. Okay sige. 

September 24 - I told him I’ll give him space and time. Ayusin nya yung mga kailangan nyang gawin the come back to me. Yes sinabi ko yan. Ayoko na makipagusap kasi magaaway lang kami. 

September 25 - “Babawi ako mahal. Promise. Mahal kita. Miss na miss kita.” Ang tanong ko lang, kung babalik pa ba sya at kung may hihintayin pa ba ako.” He said “Babalik ako mahal. Maguusap pa tayo.” —————— END OF CONVERSATION FOREVER. 

I was broken. I was mad and in pain. But all this girl can do was wait and hold unto his words. I gave it some thought. Reflections and realizations. That’s the time I told myself, I could only give him 1 week. It’s now or never after that 1 week. So technically, that was last October 2. 

October 2 - At 9pm while watching Tempest in Disney +, I had this heavy burden on my chest. I was agitated. I thought kasi Oct 2 na, kapag hindi nagparamdam wala na. As simple as that. But the heavy feeling kept on going. I even experienced skipped heartbeats. Nakakatakot. Last time I felt that was when I caught my first boyfriend cheating on me. Same feeling. Literally. Parang something’s pulling me closer to my phone and do some research. Ganun! Ladies, you know what I mean. You know when you have these “instincts”. Maniwala talaga tayo doon. Yun na yun. I was on my phone from 10pm-11pm. It took me 1 hour to unveil the truth and to unmask this guys true identity. I guess I have to shift careers now. Who wants to be my client? 😬

Google, Facebook, Instagram - I SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR EXISTING. The so-called MHN as he said was non-existing. It was a dummy account for cheating! He is AM**, not an engineer but a business consultant, not a Buddhist but a Catholic, not single but married for 4 years now (to his childhood sweetheart), not only he is married but he is also a father of 2 boys. They are 4 siblings. Remember what I said from what happened last May 24, the photo he sent me as his family members were legit except for one person - who happens to be his wife which he first claimed to be his sister. But okay, I think it counts - wife, so family member. Okay. Yung nagsabi sya na he’ll stay with his parents muna before the rally, it was because they opened their new business. The dates were there. Everything was there sa mga posts. Pero alam niyo what hurt me the most? I saw his post last August 26 - welcoming the arrival of his baby boy. It was the same date I decided to drop the L word for him. It was that time that I felt I had to tell him how I felt about him. Natulala na lang ako dun sa post nya. Dinaig ng 6.9 magnitude earthquake yung pagyanig sa buong pagkatao ko. So emote muna ako for a while. Then when I was myself again, check ko yung convo, delete photos (more of selfies), delete message about my home address and mobile number. I messaged him — cursed him, swear at him and told him wag sana sya makarma lalo his kids. Then deleted the whole convo and blocked him.

Masakit lalo what I showed him was a genuine kind of love na hindi ko naibigay ng buo sa last partner ko dahil LDR. I trusted him. Never a single doubt after I said I love him. Pero ganito ang balik saken. 2 days ako hindi makabangon sa bed. Parang latang-lata ako. I couldn’t sleep. At work, I was lost. Tulala. Ngayon, paano ka pa magmamahal? Paano mo pa ibibigay yung buong puso mo kung niloko ka ng harapan? 

I shared this story para aware kayo ladies and gents, na pwedeng mainlove in a short span of time kung talagang totoong mahal mo yung tao. Pero remember it comes with risks — too much risks. I’ve learned my lesson. Sana wag mangyari sa inyo lalo if you are on dating apps. Hanggang kaya nyo kilalanin yung tao, walang mawawala sa inyo. Kesa yung akala niyong kilala niyo na pero ibang tao pala — mas malaki ang mawawala sa inyo. YOURSELF, YOUR SANITY AND YOUR SELF VALUE. 

So eto na nga ang tanong ko for the win — WILL IT BE OK TO MESSAGE THE WIFE AND WARN HER ABOUT HER HUSBAND’S DIRTY LITTLE DEEDS? I need your thoughts on this please. 🙂 Thank you for taking time to read my story. 

PS. Wala palang nangyari samin. Hindi pinahintulutan ni Lord dahil palagi akong on my period everytime mapapagusapan. Haha. Amen!

On our first date, I was so nervous. I saw him walking down toward me, and damn, he looked so good. At the same time, I was scared because of the age gap 20f and 35m. He gave me a hug and walked me to his car. We talked about childhood, art, growing up, different cities, we laughed a lot. He got me this coffee he loved and wanted me to try, then we walked through a vintage store. That whole day just stuck with me, it felt real.

On our second date, we hung out at his place before dinner. We ended up having sex, and honestly, I was trying so hard not to get attached. But after that, he was living rent-free in my mind. It was my first time, and I didn’t imagine it happening with someone I couldn’t really have. I liked it, but part of me also regretted it because I knew he wasn’t in a place for anything serious. He told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship because he just got out of one. That hurt, and I felt a little used, even though deep down, I knew he didn’t mean to hurt me.

I decided to step back and told him I needed space because he was still healing. We stopped talking for a couple of weeks. Then I texted him again, asking if we could hang out one last time. He said yes.

When he picked me up, we both laughed about how I “left like I was looking for a husband right away.” He rubbed my thigh and said he was surprised, but happy when I texted. He apologized for not being consistent and said he knew it was my first time being that intimate with someone. Then he started asking about my life, catching up, asking if I’d been with anyone else since.

Later that day, when we were sitting and talking, he told me, “your voice is so soft and calm, but the things you’re saying are heavy.” It caught me off guard because no one’s ever said something like that to me before. Out of nowhere, he told me to stand up and just hugged me, no reason, just silence and a long hug. I’ll never forget that.

That night we got intimate again, twice actually, and it just felt peaceful, not rushed or meaningless. Before I left, he showed me some old photos on his fridge from when he was in high school, and I told him he looked so good, that I’d actually date someone like that. He laughed and said “seriously?” I said “yeah.”

Now it’s been a month, and I still think about him. The little things,how he’d look at me, how he held my thighs while driving, how he kissed me good morning, how he remembered I couldn’t finish my food on our second date. He even gave me his hat to keep, just because he wanted me to have it and I have no idea why.

He recently removed me on Instagram, and I don’t know why, but that one hurt. I thought maybe we’d stay in touch, maybe hang out again someday. I know he’s older and still healing, and maybe I was just part of that process for him. But damn, I miss the feeling of being seen like that.

I don’t know if this was love, attachment, or just two people who needed comfort at the same time. But it felt real. And I hate that I can’t stop replaying it in my head.",3,1759826123.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

She has a co worker that she talks about constantly, multiple times a day, what this person likes, mentions when something reminds them of her, and even seemed jealous and maybe bitter that this co worker might have feelings for someone else, and was recently upset they were talking to them more than her at work. This co worker has invited my gf for a ""art day"" at her house (okay..) but otherwise we've only ever hung out all together in a group. Once we went to lunch and they sat next to each other and this co worker had her arm behind my girlfriend and it made me so uncomfortable. We then got coffee after and they were so caught up in their conversation that they walked together way ahead of me and the other girl we were with waited for me and walked for me. If we weren't dating I'd accuse her of having a big crush, it doesn't help that this co worker is 100% her type, and that I'm not her usual type (they're more masc and I'm more femme)

But the thing is, I know my girlfriend loves me, I can't imagine her ever cheating on me, but it's still obvious she likes receiving attention from others even when in a committed relationship. I'm not sure if I would ever feel fully comfortable seriously dating someone who is like that. 

She even brought up to me when we were first met about how she thought she was poly, but she came to the conclusion that she was too possessive and jealous herself to be poly.

While there are plenty of friendly and welcoming places, I haven’t found one that’s queer-owned or clearly centered around queer people and community. Alpharetta just doesn’t seem to have that kind of space.
Does anyone know of a queer-owned coffee shop nearby—or even in a surrounding area—that really feels like a home for the LGBTQ+ community? I’d love to support a space where queerness isn’t just accepted, but celebrated.",0,1759825018.0,alpharetta,0,0.38,False

Solo South Korea Adventure Loading (F47 + 3rd time in SK),"So here’s the scoop: after two amazing family trips to Seoul, I’m finally heading back — this time alone! It’s been almost seven years since I’ve had a break from being a mom, school and work, and I fully intend to make this trip unforgettable. Think: five days in Seoul, five in Busan, and maybe one stop in between to surprise even myself.

I already LOVE Korea — the food, the coffee culture (yes, I’ll happily walk an extra mile for a tiny café tucked in a side street), the history, the whole thing. But this time I want to see it with fresh eyes:

☕ Neighborhood coffee shops that feel like secrets (also all the pastries, please).
🍲 A food tour or cooking class that’s unique
👗 Good, indie Korean fashion/clothing store
🎨 Traditional crafts workshops — something hands-on and meaningful to bring home
🍶 Maybe a soju tasting. Or a K-pop dance class 😆 

💃 And yes, at least one bar where impossibly handsome Korean guys dance — for the research, obviously (thanks Instagram algorithm showing me very nice looking Korean dancers and also…husband approved 😂).

Also! Best clinic/treatment/spa recommendations for this 40 something exhausted mom will be so gratefully welcomed. 

I’ll be based in Gangnam in Seoul and Marine City in Busan. I plan to explore on foot and via public transport (nothing beats the Korean subway system and I truly love the buses, too) and wander off the beaten path just enough to find the kind of places that stay with you long after you’ve flown home. 

Is baseball still in season? 

Any can’t-miss gems for someone blending curiosity, culture, food, and a tiny dash of wild freedom? I want this trip to be magical in every sense of the word.

Thanks in advance! 감사합니다",3,1759824985.0,koreatravel,1,0.81,False

I'm hoping that someone has the knowledge or similar experience and can help me with what to do. 

I'm a 32 year old female. For a few years I've had occasional night sweats and palpitations during sleep. Recently they were getting more frequent and I've struggled a lot with fatigue. 

I was reading the book Good Energy and it suggested using a CGM as blood sugar fluctuations can cause similar issues. I put in one of my husband's (he's type 1 diabetic) Dexcom one plus and went to bed. 

That night my night sweats and the CGM showed I had several ""hypos"" with my blood sugars dropping into the low and very low range (between 2.3 -3.9) intermittently and coming back up in between. I thought it might be a fluke or some issue with the sensor at the time, but over the next ten days I noticed on the senor that it would shoot up to 9-10 after most meals or coffees. But there were only a couple of low readings moments before it would come back up but I didn't have night sweats in this time period. 

I also have always been a hangry person, with shaking, dizziness, irritability if I don't eat some times. 

I went to the GP and showed her my readings and discussed my symptoms. I had blood tests and a OGTT. During the OGTT at 1 hour I was seeing readings of 10.9 on Dexcom but the results of the blood test at that time was 5.8, and then 2 hours I was seeing around 7.5 on the Dexcom, but the blood test was 3.6. 

The blood test results came back (posted at end), and I met with the GP and she said everything looked healthy and had I considered anxiety. 

While I had the CGM in I followed the advice of the glucose goddess and started to flatten my curves and was having stable nights and days. My mood and fatigue have been improved. 

Then I changed sensor, and that night had sweats and low and very low readings. I thought again it might be a sensor error as it was the first night and maybe it was calibrating. Then the next day (despite the diet change) the CGM readings were going up to 8-9 after eating again. The next night I had minor night sweats and the CGM showed multiple lows and very lows and another rollercoaster of a day the next day. 

I'm so confused as how I feel seems to be represented by the CGM but everything was fine on the blood test. I am currently around ovulation and I don't know how much hormones interplay into it all. Any advice or experience would be amazing.
