I’m looking for some advice here as a first line (well, second after google) of help.

Short backstory, I left my appartment for the holidays and just came back. While I was away, I emptied the tank of my machine (to avoid mold or weird growth), shut off electricity and left. This morning when I wanted to have my espresso, the machine made some weird noise and the water didn’t come out. The noise is the same it makes when the tank empties midway, so I assumed it had some air in the system and this was confirmed (I believe) after some google search, and I found a video of a guy priming the machine to get the air out.

I have tried to do so, but it doesn’t seem to be working, like the machine makes the same noise and if I open the frother (to bypass the valve that pressurizes the steam to brew the coffee), it just doesn’t do anything, and after a short while (5s) it stops.

I tried it for a bit until I noticed that it was getting hot (probably from trying to warm up the water), so I stopped and tried again two hours later (once it cooled down). Now, the first time I tried to, some water came out of the frother (the color was as if there was some leftover grounds that stained it, which is odd since there’s no coffee in there), but now water doesn’t come off anymore (so I’m back as I was before). It feels to me like the machine does indeed need priming, but I am not sure if I’m doing it right? Granted the machine is also 5-6 years old (so no warranty), but it was working perfectly before I left, so I don’t think it’s broken. Any advice or anything I’m missing? I’m hoping to get an espresso on monday before work, else my mood will certainly be not optimal hahaha",1,1736604342.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

At a coffee shop in a Texas town, local laws prohibit serving alcohol, beer, or caffeinated drinks to visibly pregnant women to reduce the risk of disabilities in newborns, such as fetal alcohol syndrome. These laws were implemented because abortion is not widely permitted in the town, and the government aims to lower disability rates while also supporting children with disabilities. Businesses and employees are legally protected from lawsuits if they refuse to serve these drinks, but employees can face personal fines or job loss for violations.

In this scenario, Serena, a barista who is four months pregnant and a single parent, denies Karen, a visibly pregnant customer, caffeinated coffee due to these laws and company policy. Serena does serve Karen's partner, Kevin, his coffee since he is not pregnant. Karen becomes upset, accuses Serena of discrimination, and demands to speak to a manager. Karen claims the denial is unfair, despite the town’s laws clearly allowing it.

Serena risks severe consequences, including personal fines and job loss, if she serves Karen the coffee. Karen and Kevin escalate the situation by yelling, threatening a lawsuit, and trying to have Serena fired. How would you respond?

[This is the verbal version for those who don't want to read.](https://voca.ro/11HTdT3C2Mxf)

Originally, this question was meant to be posed as ""What would you do as a bystander who's been to this bar frequently, so you know the rules and regulations?"" Type question and Kevin and Karen are new to the town so they don't know the regulations.

1hywhyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectingDFW/comments/1hywhyd/jake_and_the_jeep/,Jake and the Jeep,"Officer Jake Malone leaned back in his patrol car, staring out at the empty streets of the city. The hum of the engine was the only sound, the air thick with the usual tension of another long, exhausting shift. At 42, Jake had given the city everything he had. Twelve years on the force had chipped away at him, one brutal day after another. He’d seen too many crimes, too much heartbreak, and worse—he’d seen the people he cared about burn out, just like him. There wasn’t much left of the guy who used to be eager to put on the badge. Now, it felt like every day was just the same old grind.

He flicked the radio off and rubbed his eyes. The weight of his uniform, the smell of stale coffee and regret, all of it had started to feel suffocating. He needed a change. A break. Something to remind him that life wasn’t just about putting out fires and chasing after people who didn’t want to be caught.

Jake’s eyes drifted toward the street ahead. And then he saw it—parked outside [Clay Cooley Chrysler Dodge Jeep](https://www.claycooleycjd.com/) in Irving, like a beacon calling to him.

A 2025 [Jeep Gladiator](https://www.claycooleycjd.com/inventory/new/jeep/gladiator). But this wasn’t just any Gladiator. This one was decked out—mud tires, a lift kit, LED light bars glowing even in the daylight, and a custom paint job that screamed adventure. It was like the Jeep had been built with a purpose, with a promise of something more than the rigid confines of his daily routine.

Jake couldn’t help himself. He pulled into the lot, the engine of his patrol car almost apologetically quiet compared to the rumbling power of the Gladiator. As he got out of the car, he could feel the difference in the air. This wasn’t a police department parking lot, and it sure as hell wasn’t his usual beat. It felt like the start of something new.

The sales associate, a young guy with a wide smile and a handshake that could’ve come from a guy selling dreams, approached him. “You looking for something specific, officer?”

Jake glanced back at the Jeep, his fingers brushing against the cold metal of the Gladiator’s hood. “I don’t know, maybe. I’ve been driving the same old car for years. I’m thinking it might be time for something... different.”

“You came to the right place,” the associate said, leading him around the Gladiator. “This baby’s got everything you need to get out there, go off-road, and really live.”

Jake’s eyes sparkled, not at the sales pitch, but at the idea. For the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel like he was locked into his life. He could see himself behind the wheel of this thing, not chasing criminals or pulling over speeders but driving—anywhere. Everywhere.

“You know,” Jake said slowly, “I’ve been a cop for over a decade. You could say I’m... burnt out. I’m looking for a break. Something to remind me why I’m doing this job, something to get me out of the grind. And this Jeep… it might be just the thing.”

The associate grinned, sensing Jake’s shift in energy. “This Jeep’s not just a truck. It’s an invitation. An invitation to do something spontaneous, to take a road that isn’t planned, to wake up in the morning and go wherever the road leads you. No maps, no GPS, just you and the open world.”

Jake felt the weight of those words. He’d spent too many years following orders, sticking to a path that was laid out for him. Maybe it was time to take the wheel, not just of a car, but of his own life.

Before he knew it, Jake was sitting behind the wheel of the 2025 Jeep Gladiator, his fingers wrapping around the leather steering wheel. The power was right there at his fingertips. The thought of taking this beast off-road, exploring places he’d never dared to go before, stirred something in him. Something he hadn’t felt in years.

“Let’s see what this thing can really do,” Jake muttered to himself, a spark of excitement flickering in his chest.

By the end of the afternoon, he was signing the papers. The weight on his shoulders lifted as he realized that this Jeep wasn’t just a car—it was the key to unlocking a new chapter in his life. A life where the only sirens he’d hear would be from the adventure, not the emergency calls.

In the weeks that followed, Jake traded in his badge for a different kind of adventure. The Jeep took him on dirt roads, through rocky trails, and to places that made him feel like he was alive again. He found himself waking up early, not to catch a criminal, but to chase the sunrise from the top of a mountain or take a detour down a trail he’d never seen before.

He didn’t stop being a cop, but something inside him shifted. He learned that life didn’t have to be just about following orders or doing what was expected. It was about finding those moments of freedom—the ones where you could just drive and be.

And all it took was a chance encounter with a 2025 Jeep Gladiator to remind him that sometimes the best decisions in life are the ones that come when you’re least expecting them.",1,1736604135.0,ConnectingDFW,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1736604083.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

Now I don't have the devastating insomnia that some of you do, but everyday I would be tired from crappy sleep. I'd wake up too early, hard time falling asleep, ruminating thoughts, racing heart, just unable to RELAX. 

This terrible feeling would continue during the day even in my exhaustion. I could rarely even nap anymore to relieve the fatigue. 

Then I discovered the Ray Peat diet. Counter to everything I've been doing and eating in the name of health for the last 20 years I finally embraced sugar and the change in my disposition was immediate. 

I slept HARD for the first time in a year. I am able to nap again and best of all I feel so much less stressed. 

I'm a woman and naturally for the last 20 years i've been on a low carb diet in an effort to maintain my figure. I honestly think I've been slowly destroying my stress response, nervous system and thyroid all this time.

Now I can't say I'm totally cured, but my GOD I feel SO MUCH BETTER. I can relax and have a deep restorative sleep again. I thought those days for me were over.

I promise I'm not selling the diet, I couldn't care less really I just thought to share my experience in case someone else desperate for change wants to look into it and give it a shot. 

My diet now consists mostly of fruit, sugar, coffee (with sugar), coconut oil, honey, marmalade, orange juice, milk, eggs, chicken, gelatinous meat, some cheese, and well cooked vegetables. I'm still tweaking things and learning but I'm so happy about the change in my sleep and over all energy levels. 

If you are desperate give it a try for just a week and see if anything changes! I wish you all healing.

But when I got home, I felt my Next Level Hoop paper and I could consistently tell a difference.

Anyways, I don't have a Pulsar so maybe this is already documented in their manual.   ",1,1736603646.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1hywagg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hywagg,2024 highlights - gear,"During the course of the year, I managed to get some new gear to level up my home brewing experience.

**Kruve - EQ Glassware**

* I like both Excite and Inspire.
* I appreciate the single walled drinking section and double walled holding section.
* I landed up using the Inspire the most but still pull out the Excite every so often.
* To get the full experience of the vessels, fill volume is about 150ml, but you can push it to 200ml as a max fill.

**Tens Hundreds Thousands coffee - dosing tray**

* Solid build, feels good.
* Way nicer to use than the 'Tupperware' container I was using to dose in before.

**Loveramics - 220ml Classic Colour Changing Cupping Bowls**

* I opted for the 'classic' over the 'modern' due to volume. 220ml makes more sense than 200ml for a quick and easy cupping of 12grams coffee to 200grams water.
* I had originally expected the whole bowl to change colour but it's only the bottom section that changes colour.
* The default colour is also not a pure black when cool or at room temperature, it's a bit of a dark grey.
* Super fun to use and much more comfortable than using normal coffee mugs for a cupping.

**Loveramics - 250ml Embossed Tasting Cup**

* I was originally going to opt for the 150ml but landed up ordering 250ml and it was the right decision.
* It gets a bit hot if you pour fresh coffee straight into the cup but cools down quick enough. It can be uncomfortable if you don't have a table or surface to leave the cup on while it's cooling down.
* Very nice to drink out of. Excellent for chilling on the couch and drinking some of your favourite brew.
* This has become my 'after work' cup.

**Orea - Brewer Porcelain**

* It feels great.
* I like that it's quite unusual, just one big hole.
* It definitely took me a few attempts to get used to but now I like brewing with it.

With my first few attempts, the flow/draw down rate was just so much faster than what I am used to (coming from Chemex & V60), I actually landed up running the coffee through the bed twice to ensure it was not under extracted.

I tried a couple of large (for this brewer) batches of 40 grams and I think it's just a bit too much coffee for the brewer.\
I found the sweet spot for me is 18 to 20 grams coffee but it comfortably handles 30 grams.\
If I had taken the time to read the guidelines on the website in advance, I'd have seen they recommend 12 to 28 grams, so there you go. LOL.\

**Orea - Sense Carafe (300ml)**

* It looks and feels great.
* It's quite a bit thicker than the Sense glass, in a good way.
* It pours really well - I was concerned it might drip but the spout seems to be super sharp.
* I enjoy using this for when I brew a medium batch that won't all fit in my cup at once.
* This to me is very much a nice to have Carafe and less of a 'need' carafe. A 600ml Timemore Coffee Server is definitely more of a workhorse than this.

**Orea - Sense Glass (Large - 275ml)**

* Looks cool. Feels a bit odd - I'm not 100% sure how I am meant to be holding and drinking out of it.
* Oddness aside, I like it.
* I'd say this is something you would use for 'critical drinking' and trying to dig into the complexitities of a coffee, and less so for just chilling and enjoying the coffee for that I'd rather recommend the Loveramics tasting cup.

**Orea - Sense Cup (Small 175ml - porcelain)**

* Looks and feels great. I really like it.
* Nice to use in conjunction with the Sense Carafe for sipping on (or sharing) small brews of rare coffee, the type that they sell in a test tubes.
* Not something I would recommend as a sit and chill on the couch cup.

**Sibarist - Booster**

* It doesn't fit as snuggly into the Orea porcelain as I had imagined it would.
* I like it and use it most of the time.

---

I haven't had a chance to do any comparative brewing between Sibarist and the normal Hario V60 paper so that'll need to happen in 2025.\
The long stirrers (generic brand off Amazon) are nice for stiring an Aeropress; I don't use them as much as I thought I would.\

I’ve already been to the Vet about 3-4 times regarding this and I am starting to get desperate on whether or not I should worry.

My golden retriever (M, 3) has brownish-black wax in his right ear, and has had for a while. It fills up pretty quickly, usually two-three days after cleaning. It doesn’t really have the coffee ground aspect of ear mites and it’s not smelly either (unless you stick it really really close to your nose and even then it’s rather faint)

He scratches his ear from time to time but there is no change in his behaviour.
First I was given ear drops (Canaural) and then when it didn’t work I was given pills (Prednidale) that I had to give him for about three weeks while reducing the dose as we go and cleaning his ear every two days.

I have done this, but after stopping the treatment it was back exactly as before and I’m starting to suspect I only thought it was better cause I was cleaning his ears too often for the build up to happen. 

I have already paid around £300 on this and I don’t want to go to them again to be given something that won’t work.

Could it be that my dog just has an ear that’s more sensitive? He did get a spikelet in that ear when he was younger but the vet (a different one cause we moved since then) had taken it out and didn’t signal anything. ",1,1736603187.0,AskVet,3,1.0,False
1hyw6hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbiangang/comments/1hyw6hw/my_ex_reached_out_but_im_not_sure_if_they_want_to/,My ex reached out but I'm not sure if they want to get back together,"So, my ex (we're both 21) reached out to me like 3 weeks ago after over 3 years no contact (we were close friends before, and briefly after, we were a couple), and on Tuesday we went to a coffee shop and spent the day catching up. This whole thing has made me realise that I'm still in love with them, even though I've thought for a long time that I was over them. In the two weeks before that, I hadn't really talked to them much over text unless they initiated a conversation, which they did a couple times, and to arrange when we were meeting. Since then, we've had two long conversations, one on Wednesday and one on Thursday, both of which I initiated. With everything that's happened, including a pretty lengthy apology from them, I'm confident they've matured past the stuff that made them a not-so-great partner back then, and I've matured a lot too and apologised to them for stuff.

So after all this, I'm sure I want to try and get back together, but I dont know if they feel the same. It's probably important to mention that not long before we went no contact, I asked them if they wanted to try getting together again, and they said they weren't looking for that at the moment, but this was in September 2021, so obviously a long time ago, especially when we're both young. Also we're both single, which I should probably make clear.

One of my friends (none of them know my ex) says hes pretty confident they want to get back together, but my other friends say it could really go either way. I do have some reasons to think they might want to, but none of them are at all conclusive and could just be friendly. For one, during our text conversations they're always quick to reply and the conversations go on for hours (all of them have only ended when one of us went to bed) and they put a lot of effort in, giving detailed replies and taking a clear interest in talking to me and hearing about the things I have to say. However, since we met up they haven't initiated any of the conversations, I initiated both of them, and I thought I'd let them initiate the next one, but they haven't yet, and it's now the second day since we've texted. My friends say that's nothing to worry about if the conversations themselves are so good with them always taking an interest, putting in effort, and replying quickly, and that some people just don't initiate text conversations much, but idk.  
  
In person and over text, theyre even interested in my nerdy hyperfixation (I have autism and I'm confident they're at least some sort of neurodivergent, in a very similar way to me) which is the American Civil War (we live in Scotland so it has almost no direct relevance to us) and on Thursday when talking they even brought up a Civil War movie I'd mentioned on Tuesday and said they really want to watch it. I take the same level of interest in their hyperfixations, even though they're not stuff I would usually find interesting. When it's them telling me about it, I want to learn every little detail about yugioh or critical role or any other random thing. We joked about indoctrinating each other into our interests and saying that if it worked too well we'll end up just swapping interests entirely. We also make fun of each other in a lighthearted way, for example them saying how distinctive my style is and saying it makes me like a real life cartoon character (in a nice way, not a mean way) and me saying similar things to them. We have very silly and goofy conversations, making dumb little jokes that end up as running bits (the most recent spinning off a joke they made about me getting my brain swapped while on holiday) and just in general I'm much more silly when I'm talking to them than I usually am, and they're very silly talking to me as well (tho idk if they talk to other people like that, I haven't been with them in a group setting in years).  
  
In person they always laugh at every dumb little joke I make, and they smile a lot. Quite a number of times while hanging out and chatting on Tuesday, we would both fall silent and for a second or two they'd just be looking into my eyes smiling, until one of us broke it off. Idk if it means anything, but it certainly made me feel very intense things.

I know the only way to find out for sure is to ask them, and I will, I was just wondering what people here thought about the whole situation since it's causing me a lot of stress and hope and worries at the same time.

1hyw6hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActualLesbiansOver25/comments/1hyw6hl/decided_to_share_this_wild_date/,Decided to share this wild date,"Okay so I had the weirdest ""date"" recently, and the more I think about it, the more I'm just amused by how bad it was. I don't even regret going, because it makes me laugh.
 
Backstory (can skip): So I had a first date with this lady and that was fine, im late 20s and she's mid 30s. We just met for coffee, chatted, no kiss or anything at the end,  but it all seemed fine. I drove to meet her for that date. She asks me on a second one, but then never gives me an address and ghosts me from the night before the date. I double checked but she didn't get back to me until after the date time, she said she was very ill, and is super apologetic and asks me for a makeup date. So I accepted that at face value. She continues to barely talk to me until the date, but then really wants me to come. 

Actual date story: She invited me to her house for dinner. I turn up, and it's her, her male housemate, and a friend of his. Weird. We all sit on the couch, and she proceeds to ignore me for the rest of the night. She is asking her housemate what music he wants to listen to, she is making fun of him for his awful music taste. She asks me once if I like the music and I said no, I also think it's awful. She continues to put on this music for him that she hates all night. She's asking him what food he wants delivered. Her hosuemate actually is trying to be a good host to me (not his responsibility) and is asking me what music or food I would like, but she's ignoring everything I say. She was briefly interested when the topic of breast implants came up and I said I had them, but that was it. She was also instigating in-jokes i couldnt participate in and showing her hosuemate something on her phone they were talking about secretly. It seemed like she was taking any action to exclude me. I decided to just try to have a fun time anyway, I drink wine, I chat to her friends, they seemed to genuinely like me. Eventually, she disappears. After 20-30mins, I realise she is not coming back. She has left me in a strange house with 2 men I don't know (they were perfectly polite and I never felt unsafe, this is just weird though). I end up wandering through her dark house to find her in her room. She's laying in bed and says she's going to sleep, but I can stay up drinking with her housemate if i want. And then sleep over. Um?? 
I declined, she offered multiple times for me to stay. But I have no interest in continuing this, and definitely not sleeping together if that's what she meant, it takes a lot more to get me into bed than this. She asked me if I'm coming over on Thursday for a BBQ with her friends again. I said yes because I just wanted to leave.
I go home. Next morning she sends me a good morning text and I told her I don't want to pursue anything and that going to bed without a word and leaving me to search through her house to find her is wild. She said no worries, she felt the same. 
I'm pretty sure she did not feel the same because I did not have 2 people at our date and I did not leave her with them 😂",3,1736603120.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,2,1.0,False

I recently moved back to Westchester and it’s been disappointing to discover some of the places I got food at for years ended up increasing their prices by a lot. One Italian pizzeria I went to is now charging 15-16 dollars for a sandwich. I used to pay like 10-12 dollars the most a few years ago. Another place where I used to get really good panini combos now charging 16-17 dollars whereas a few years ago it was like 11-12. One of my favorite breakfast spots now charges 13-14 dollars for a small iced coffee and a breakfast sandwich. I used to be able to get a large iced coffee and a breakfast sandwich for like 8-10 dollars. One breakfast spot changed its menus twice in one month to increase its prices. 

Maybe I am reading this wrong but I know the economy is bad and things are getting expensive but does anyone else feel people are price gouging and charging more than they should on specific things? Like overpricing? Also, the current times feel weird like there’s a card fee everywhere I go now. You can’t openly use the restroom unless you are a paying customer. If you try to get breakfast after 11 some places charge a fee. I ended up searching around and finding places that were dramatically much cheaper than where my favorite spots were. It’s sad to not go to my regular spots but it shocks me how much people have been increasing their prices so much to the point it’s driving away loyal customers.

**9 AM - 5 PM:** Work. Technically. But really, I’m daydreaming about the next EGOCON. Last year, we partied hard, learned a ton, and walked away with the $EGO cap. This year? I’m hoping for a hoodie...

**8 PM:** Dinner. Trying to explain to my friends why $EGO is about to change crypto forever. “Imagine booking a luxury hotel with Hotel.io while farming rewards on Swene.io.” They’re confused. I’m smug.

**9:30 PM:** Evening updates. The app is launching soon, and the Telegram is buzzing with theories. Will it manage staking? Track rewards? Summon a gecko to motivate you during dips? No one knows, but we’re all hyped.

**11 PM:** Lying in bed, picturing myself at the next EGOCON, wearing exclusive merch, and celebrating $EGO’s latest milestones. Sleep? Overrated. Gecko dreams? Priceless.

Context: I have a family cabin that's quite remote. It's self sufficient (solar, water, etc), and prepped about 50lbs of food as a test. Pretty much just staples (rice/beans/powdered milk/lentils/pasta/instant coffee/etc). They're stored in mylar bags with o2 absorbers in 2 bins out of sunlight. No canned goods or liquids as they would 100% explode (have forgotten to bring some beer home and came back in spring to find it as such). Just did this last summer as a fun hobby outside of my home preps which are more carefully planned.

During the winter the temperature can drop to -30c (-22f) and in the summer it can go to 30c (86f+). Curious what thoughts are on how they may fare over a 5-10 year period and advice on best practice(s). Maybe it's entirely untenable/silly - which I won't be offended by if that's the reasonable consensus.

**Side note** This is a great community and this is my first post. Mostly prep for Tuesday with some other possibly unnecessary indulgences that I think are neat (gas masks, ammo stockpile, various guns, MH/lifeboat biscuits,  waterbob, etc) or will add to my regular camping gear. Another thread talked about pests as an issue and it dawned on me that my *plastic* (facepalm) bins may well just be well stocked homes for the mice we clear out each spring. It's possible I just set up a winter buffet for critters, lol. Live 'n learn.

To those that have helped, supported, and stuck around, thank you.

To those that I’ve hurt, left behind, and disappointed, I am truly sorry. I’m getting the help I need and am growing from that person I once was. 

I’d make a couple changes, but ultimately every experience good and bad made me into who I am today. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.

Cantermagne: i think you just want the coffee beans. remember, there isnt a lot of trees at this island, but you may grind your farming till max. But caution! This island allows looting, so it is advisable to ensure your weapon at the bank or if you are broke, just store it in the bank.

Stonemore: you went to this island for mining right? Well technically gregory mineshaft is a great mine but im not sure about today cuz i haven't been in that island for a long time. Remember this advice! Get warm gear, have a lantern and a torch, 6 logs or 3 logs 1 campfire stand and a grill or pot for warmth and food. 

This island also allows looting and combats, but recently, not a lot of combats have been happening around in that island lately. Also ensure your weapons and have a lot of money because you wont know when you will be attacked.

Rupert: this is a great island but freezing.. so warm gear, lantern and torch a house for you to live in for warmth and make sure you insure your weapons. 
Remember! Have a house near St Paul Plains or at the River of St Paul (i dont remember the name) so you can just reset from anywhere and be at st paul anytime you want. This island is well popukated by brits, colonists (99.98% of you), and france ,so its better to keep an eye out for bounties, treasure hunts and attacks happening. If you encounter an attack, do not join them as you will be targeted by colonists and other factions.


Ellesmere: Finally.. a deathwish island. You think you can survive? Hell, just by having the warmest gear of 2023 will not even give +5 warmth. Remember, this island is dangerous, as it has no banks, and the most useful safezone is at Ellesmere village. It is advisable to bring you gear, weapons and bandage. You dont want to live here, because your weapon's insurance is not permanent. It is advisable to explore this island for grinding only. 

Note for Stonemore and Ellesmere:
Just because there is barely any people in those islands, does not mean you are entirely safe. People will become competitive for resources and land. So it is advisable to ignore people who are trying to do the samw thing as you. Do not try to sabotage them, if they sabotage you, try to fight back but dont go to thwir house and loot everything, remember you went to the islands stated above for grinding only. 

Note for Cantermagne: it is recommended to have a farmhouse so you can do contracts for farming and get coffee beans and get money. It worked for me and in the span of 1-2 months, my farming went from apprentice to expert. And i have around 4000 pounds. 

General advice:
- every contracts has a time limit of 30 minutes so when farming contract, mining, leatherworking, have a house for each contract depending on your island e.g farmhouse in cantermagne. The purpose for that statement is to store for future contracts so you dont have to be very busy getting the materials again and again.

- You may trust people, but do not trust them entirely, this happened to me everytime. I gave them everything they need, ammo, food, pelts. But they repay me by killing me and looting my house.

- STAY AWAY FROM CERTAIN NATIVES! They will attack a house in their sight because of invasion of land. But, if a native is friendly, be on high alert as they can attack any moment.

- at least bring 50-75 pounds to ellesmere. Remember, people dont know accounting so its advisable to bring your pounds and spend them wisely and have just enough for you to return to your homeland.

- Make sure you bring extra ammunition. Just having one pouch is not enough because sometimes when hunting, we miss our target. So it is advisable to bring at least 3-5 pouches. It is also recommended to have some extra ammunition and extra weapons in your house incase your weapon got looted and/or depleted of ammunition.

I sleep on damn adjustable bed (I hate it so much, I would have never bought this thing if I didn’t have GERD) with my upper body raised. I still get severe heartburn as soon as I go to “lay down”. 

My gum hurts so bad, and my once healthy good teeth are ruined even though I brush my teeth twice a day and floss daily (never missed a day). 

I have never been overweight. Im actually underweight (it’s genetic, but it has gotten even harder to gain weight with so many digestive issues). 

I don’t like to use the word “hate”, but I seriously HATE this horrible miserable mean disease. 

I want to be able to enjoy eating and sleep comfortably on a regular mattress. Curl up in a blanket on cold days and fall asleep in my warm bed.

My husband has had a severe episode of allergies and eczema recently so he got a appointment with a primary care doctor

Background: my husband has had severe allergies and asthma since he was a kid. He reacted to everything on his skin prick test as a teenager and always has to take clearitin or use his rescue inhaler. Over the past year he developed eczema and it got very severe, he had red sleeves and weeping and crusting. It spread all over his face and to all of his creases. We finally moved out of a house that had 3 large pet birds and he's progressively been getting a lot better.

He went to a primary care doctor for a referral to an allergist but they said they wanted to do tests first. They did a blood panel and a blood allergy panel. He came back at 100+ level 6 allergies to dust and animal dander, his IGE percentage was 12,400. Off the charts. We had been moved out of the house for about 4 weeks when his labs were taken. 

He has a follow up soon but the lab screwed up and listed him as female so his quest test results aren't as great as they looked at first. Besides his insane allergies and IGE the rest of his labs came back normal except I have some questions about these results 

27 male 
WBC 7.0 thousand/uL
RBC 4.76 million/uL
hemoglobin 14.7 g/dL
hemocrit 45.2%
mcv 95fl
mch 30.9 pg

rdw 12.3%
platelet count 352

basonophils 42 cells/ul
total iron 70 mcg/dl
iron binding capacity 349 mcg/dl 
transferrin saturation percent 20%
ferritin 103ng/ml


Are these results normal? Some are on the very low end of normal and I'm worried about him. The lab website says everything is normal but is it? I should mention we work nights and he took these labs at what would be 10pm for us and they were fasted. He also doesn't eat much but he drinks cups and cups of coffee. Please advise thank you.

I wanted to thank you for taking me along on that trip. After sitting alone for so long, I never imagined I’d get out to the lake one more time.

I was just going through my photos, and I still cannot get over how “picture perfect” (pun intended)  the entire trip was. Do you know what my favorite day was? The one when you caught that musky with your dad and Tommy. 

It had been a day full of sun, fun, and unfortunately, not a lot of fish thus far. No matter though. As the sun rose over the lake that day, I felt your familiar grip once again, steadying me as I focused on the reflection of water and smiles. It had been years since I’d been part of a story like this. The boys spent their day in and out of the lake, learning to use the paddle boat, strengthening their swim stroke whenever they fell out or jumped out – there seemed to be a mix of both. I watched through my lens as Nick’s face lit up, the reflection of the water sparkling behind him. My shutter clicked just in time to catch the bullfrog in his hands and the mischief in his eyes.

That evening, the sun had begun its slow return towards the horizon. Night lasted forever up North, and it allowed for additional hours together, in different combinations of me, your family, and your parents. As a last minute decision, you grabbed me, along with Tommy, and convinced your dad that you should go out and cast for something big.

You told us it had been years – literally – since you casted on a musky rod. And, if you were honest, you were really just going to give Tommy some alone time with his Papa, and let Papa try to catch a fish. Your dad found the perfect bay, and there was just enough breeze to keep the bugs away, as the drift was set. It truly was a picturesque evening, and the spot couldn’t have been better. 

Tommy was preoccupied with searching the surroundings and preparing his pole. With the boat drifting perfectly, you picked up an old lure and cast your line. Suddenly, you felt it—a tug that brought you back to endless days in boats with your dad. And just like that, the two of you danced through the familiar rhythm of reeling in a musky.

“I think I have something,” you said quietly. 

“Log? Rock?” your dad said. 

“No, it’s a fish – a big one.”

The dance had begun. It was choreographed, and one you had practiced many times before. While your dad fretted about not having the correct net, or a gaf, or anything, really to get in a large fish, you began to narrate what you were doing, what Tommy should be doing, and what you needed from your dad in a calm, low voice. 

I do have to say, while I have seen many a landing of a fish, this was one was perfect. As the fish came towards the surface, all three of your faces looked over the boat at a 42 inch musky, which cooperated as best they could, and allowed you to gently bring it in.

“Majestic,” you and your dad uttered in unison. 

The fish was taken off the lure, and released. 

But, not before Tommy got me out to take some pictures. Yes, there are some of his feet. One of your backside. But after you navigated over poles, boxes, and snacks to the front of the boat, the pictures he captured on me that day were the best I’ve seen. The backdrop, the fish – but most importantly, and my favorite – the smiles. As you and your dad worked together to land the fish, I stayed steady with Tommy, recording the teamwork, the excitement, and that one complete moment when all three of you leaned over to admire the musky as it returned to the water.

In that action, I was taken back to those trips you used to take me on when it was just you and your dad. Now, you had added someone new to the tribe. Tommy had been practicing his photography. A natural observer, he had a talent, and I appreciated his desire to have a record of this time. I’ve loved the time and dedication he’s given to capturing the sunrises and sunsets, his grandma on the dock with Lucas. You and Travis having coffee first thing in the morning. There have been bugs, and birds. Fish and worms. Images of the home, and endless photos of the shore.

He reminds me a lot of you. Tommy was so careful with me, his small hands adjusting my settings as he framed each shot. I could tell he was trying to capture the way he saw the world—just like you used to when you were his age.

I can only see the world in fragments, frozen in time, but those fragments are where life’s magic lives.

Thank you for bringing me along—it was just what I needed. Once, I was alive with purpose, capturing your stories and moments of joy. I know I’m not sleek like the phones everyone uses now, but there’s something special about my focus: capturing the moment, undistracted. I know I’ll go back to the drawer once the newness fades—it's what happens to all of us. But the images I hold now, and the way Tommy laughed while flipping through them on the ride back, reminded me of my worth.

After all these years, I didn’t expect to be brought back to life. But on this trip, I became a keeper of your family’s memories once more. When you powered me down and placed me in my case, I felt full—not of battery, but of joy. Thank you for reminding me of the beauty a simple click can preserve. Until next time, send my love to your family—and to Tommy, for giving this old camera a second chance.",1,1736601654.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

1hyvmzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1hyvmzj/shards_of_earth_recommended/,Shards of Earth - recommended,"An excellent read. Recommended.  Good characters. Interesting story.  Some new  enough ideas that I didn’t feel it was the same old recycled pulp. 

I just finished Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky.  

Like many of you, I’d (a while ago) finished all the Culture books, read Hyperion, Revelation Space, The Salvagers, Continuance, Dune books (even some his son wrote), Altered Carbon, Wool, 3 Body, Ringworld, Murderbot, and a lot more— just illustrating that I read the usual suspects and like them all (if Keyser Soze was in space I’d read that too). 

My kindred Reddit print sci-fi’ers recommended Children of Earth but I couldn’t find it on any of my eLibraries linked to Libby, not even print versions (or gasp, audio). All check out for months. 

But Shards of Earth was there so I grabbed it. Gobbled it up.  

There are other more in depth write ups on Reddit or good reads but I just wanted to add the basics:  enjoyable characters. Cool premise. Neat aliens. Cool monster antagonist. Great mega monster alien doing interesting destructive things that form cool visuals in your own mind’s eye. 

Some of the dialogue was annoying, that’s unavoidable. Most of it was not.  Some of it was a bit whiney. Most was not. There was enough cool action, cool, punchy sci fi weapons, enough battle scenes without just being fights for the sake of action.  I liked the thought of a post Earth human civilization and the fractions that formed. I liked the rather thinly veiled questioning gender/sex norms - reasonable and not overtly in your face to make a point - I found it fun and added a lot to the story.  I was happy as it unfolded and pleased with the build up to the end and even the last page (which I just read moments ago) left me smiling.  

Off to find the next one (Eyes of the Void) - hoping Libby comes through, but if it’s checked out I finally snagged a copy of the first Bobiverse so I’ll be all set for this snowy, cold day and my huge press of coffee.

Losing my partner was devastating, but it was the ripple effects that truly shattered me. The home we built together was gone, the plans we’d made erased. I walked out of that courthouse with just a suitcase, and it hit me like a punch to the chest I had nowhere to go.

At first, I tried to lean on friends. A couch here, a spare room there. But people don’t realize how quickly sympathy runs dry. They expect you to bounce back, to have a plan, to figure it out. But I didn’t have a plan. All I had were sleepless nights and the growing weight of shame on my shoulders.

The first night I spent on the street was a kind of heartbreak I didn’t know existed. Sitting on a cold bench, clutching my suitcase, I felt like a ghost in my own life. Every sound startled me. The cold seeped into my bones, but the shame burned hotter. I kept asking myself, How did it come to this?

Days blurred together. I wandered the city, searching for warmth, for shelter, for a meal when I could muster the courage to ask. Every time someone’s eyes slid past me as if I didn’t exist, it chipped away at my spirit. And the ones who did see me? Some looked with pity, others with disgust. Both stung in different ways.

I spent a lot of time walking, trying to escape the thoughts that haunted me. At first, I was consumed by anger at my ex for leaving, at myself for failing, at the universe for abandoning me. But after a while, even anger couldn’t sustain me. What was left was a deep, aching sadness.

One day, I caught my reflection in a coffee shop window. My clothes were worn, my face was pale and lined with exhaustion, and I barely recognized myself. For a moment, I saw myself the way the world probably did: broken, defeated. But then, something shifted. I noticed the glint of determination in my own eyes, a stubborn refusal to disappear entirely.

That moment didn’t fix everything, but it planted a seed. I realized that as long as I was still here, I had the power to fight, to claw my way back. Slowly, painfully, I started to piece myself together.

It’s not an easy road. Some days feel impossible. But I’ve learned that rock bottom isn’t the end it’s where you decide whether to give up or rebuild. And while I might not have much right now, I have myself. That’s enough to start. I’m learning to see myself, even when the world doesn’t.

This isn’t the life I imagined, but it’s still my life. And I’m determined to make it something worth living again.",39,1736601280.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

So, I've decided to build myself a bike on my own.I really like the colorway and design of the ""Standert"" steel frame bikes, but I'm not willing to pay that price for a steel frame.

She was the first one to offer coffee to the wildcard trio while others laughed but half the time she's just crying as if her daily soap hasn't stopped. She only fights people on their tone not being respectful enough, not on actual muddas, isn't close friends with anyone. Rajat too isn't but he's at least interesting to watch. No, I don't support him and his criminal activities, before y'all start. 
She wore western before but in the house she's this epitome of sati savitri naari. Her clothes are her choice but this feels inauthentic to me. And her mom saying ki ""andhe ladke se bhi shadi kra denge to kuch nhi bolegi ye"" really ticked me off.
Anyways, I only wish the best to her, especially after her mother's that statement and she's much more likable than Eisha but that's like the bottom mark. Why do we love her like we did DV?

1hyv58k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1hyv58k/memory_lane_a_crossroads_of_time_and_tec_written/,"Memory lane, a crossroads of time and tec Written by Geo","I remember back when times were both simpler and more complicated at the same time! Youngsters these days don't know how easy they have it!

Take my old rotary phone, for instance. That beautiful cream-colored piece of engineering sat on my desk like a faithful friend, its coiled cord stretched and kinked from years of pacing while talking. Sometimes I'd catch myself tracing my fingers along its smooth plastic surface, worn to a soft sheen from countless conversations. The satisfying weight of the handset, the way it cradled perfectly between my shoulder and ear – they just don't make phones like that anymore.

Living in small-town America meant some things changed slower than others. When most families were switching to touch-tone phones, my parents stubbornly kept our pulse-based rotary, claiming it had ""character."" They weren't entirely wrong. Sure, it was a pain when you had to navigate automated systems (""Press 1 for English"" was more like ""Wait helplessly for a human operator""), but there was something special about being one of the last houses in town with that mechanical connection to the past.

Dialing was a ritual all on its own. You'd slip your finger into the cool plastic hole, drag the heavy rotor around until it hit the metal stop, and then let go and wait for the round dial to circle back, like a stargate searching for the next chevron to lock in place. That mechanical whirr as the dial spun back was like music, the gentle clicking of gears beneath the surface telling you that yes, your number was being sent out into the world. You couldn't rush it – you had to wait for the full rotation before dialing the next digit. But that was okay. We had time back then, or at least we thought we did.

It's December 31st, 1999, and I'm trying to coordinate my Y2K party. Each phone call is an adventure in patience. *Click-whirr-click* Seven digits, each one a small eternity! I'm calling Sarah for the third time today because our last conversation got cut off by static as it was its habit to do so after a morning rain, and it was quite a substantial one this time! Through the crackling line, I could swear I heard fragments of Mrs. Henderson's bridge club gossip bleeding through – something about her daughter's new boyfriend with the motorcycle.

""Katalina?"" Sarah's voice finally comes through. ""I was just about to call you! Did you hear about Jenny? Her car broke down, and she's worried about getting to your place tonight.""

I cradle the phone closer, twirling the spiral cord around my finger until it turns pink. ""She can't miss it! This is literally the party of the century!"" I laugh at my own joke, but there's a nervous edge to it. The Y2K bug has everyone on edge, even those of us trying to play it cool.

My eyes drift to my computer, my faithful Pentium II running Windows 98. Winamp is minimized but still faithful, my carefully curated playlist waiting for tonight, just like Jenny! The dancing llama visualizer has been hypnotizing me all morning as I test the tracks. Will it all crash at midnight? Will every computer in the world just... die?! The rational part of my brain says no, but there's still that nagging... what-if?!

Earlier this morning, I'd performed my daily ritual of powering up that beige tower. The moment you pressed the power button, you were greeted with that distinct mechanical whine of the hard drive spinning up, like a tiny jet engine coming to life. The fan would kick in with its familiar whoosh, and then came the series of beeps – the computer's way of saying ""Good morning, I'm checking if all my parts are still here."" The monitor would flicker to life with that high-pitched frequency only CRT displays could produce, and Windows 98 would slowly paint itself across the screen, one element at a time. The startup sound would play through my cream-colored computer speakers – that triumphant little melody that meant you were ready to face the digital world.

I've spent weeks downloading songs from Napster, each one taking AGES through my dial-up connection. That familiar series of electronic screeches and beeps haunts my dreams now – the sound of the internet coming to life through phone lines that were never meant to carry so much information. If the Y2K bug wipes my hard drive, I'll lose everything. Including my precious collection of Third Eye Blind and Smashing Pumpkins tracks.

The phone rings again – that bold, mechanical bell that demands attention. It's not like today's customizable ringtones; this sound meant business. My heart does a little jump, like it always does. Who could it be? In 1999, every ring was a mystery, a potential adventure. No caller ID to spoil the surprise.

It's my best friend Maria, calling from her new Nokia cell phone at the grocery store. The connection isn't perfect – cell coverage in our town is still spotty at best – but there's something magical about hearing her voice coming through without any wires. ""They're out of cheese balls!"" she announces, crisis mode fully activated. ""And the lines are insane. Everyone's stocking up like it's the apocalypse!""

The irony isn't lost on me – here she is, using space-age technology to tell me about cheese balls, while I'm receiving the news through a phone that's older than I am. This is 1999 in a nutshell: one foot in the future, one in the past, and nobody quite sure which way to lean.

Organizing this party has been like trying to orchestrate a circus using two tin cans and a string. Half my friends have cell phones that only work if they stand on one foot facing east, while the other half are still leaving messages on my parents' answering machine. Yesterday, I had to explain to my mom why she shouldn't record over my party planning messages with her grocery list... AGAIN!

I've created three different versions of my party planning list: one on my computer (backed up twice on floppy disks, because I'm not taking any chances), one in my Lisa Frank notebook (complete with rainbow dolphin stickers), and one on our family's magnetic kitchen whiteboard. The last one was a mistake – my dad kept adding his own items. Apparently, he thinks we need emergency flares and canned beans at my New Year's party. Thanks Daaad!

The Y2K preparations have taken on a life of their own. My tech-savvy friend Kevin (who recently got his A+ certification and won't let anyone forget it) keeps sending me increasingly paranoid emails about protecting my computer. His latest suggestion was to wrap my entire PC in aluminum foil ""just in case."" I told him if he shows up to my party wearing a tinfoil hat, he's not getting any of the Dunkaroos I specially ordered.

Speaking of special orders, I've created a system of backup plans for the party music. Plan A is my carefully curated Winamp playlist. Plan B is a stack of CDs arranged in perfect playing order. Plan C is my old boombox with a collection of carefully crafted mix tapes. Plan D... involves my little sister's toy karaoke machine, and a promise that I'll let her sing ""Genie in a Bottle"" exactly ONCE, if all other music options fail!  God help us if we get to Plan D.

The phone rings again, and I dive for it, nearly knocking over my precarious tower of backup supplies. Dad's Y2K paranoia has spread beyond the kitchen whiteboard – we now have enough batteries to power a small city and more bottled water than a Costco. I had to move three cases of canned soup just to make space for the party snacks.

""Hello?"" I cradle the handset while untangling myself from the cord – a daily yoga routine I never asked for.

It's Jenny again, but this time she's calling from her dad's new cell phone. The connection makes her sound like she's speaking from inside a submarine. ""Kat? *static* ...bring the... *crackle* ...and should I... *buzz* ...midnight?""

""Jenny? JENNY?"" I'm practically shouting into the receiver. ""You're breaking up! Did you say something about midnight?""

The line goes dead. I stare at the phone, contemplating the irony of how sending a simple text message is still the stuff of science fiction for most of us, while simultaneously preparing for the potential digital apocalypse. I'll have to call her back, but first, I need to let the dial settle from my last attempt. I swear I can hear it mocking me with its slow, deliberate return to zero.

My computer chirps – another ICQ message. Probably Kevin with more suggestions about protective measures for my electronic equipment. Last time it was a lengthy dissertation about the importance of printing out my entire hard drive ""just in case."" I'm starting to think he doesn't understand how paper or computers work.

The real kicker is trying to explain all this to my grandmother, who's convinced that Y2K means her microwave will gain consciousness and try to take over the world. I didn't have the heart to tell her that if any appliance in her kitchen was going to become sentient, it would definitely be her passive-aggressive coffee maker. That thing has had an attitude since 1987.

I finally manage to get through to Jenny using the elaborate ""call her home phone, then her dad's cell phone, then her neighbor's house if all else fails"" protocol we've established. She's bringing her brother's Sony Discman as emergency backup for Plan C (the mix tapes), but she's worried because it's been acting up lately. ""It only skips every third song now,"" she assures me, as if this is a vast improvement. At this rate, Plan D's karaoke machine is looking less like a nightmare and more like an inevitability.

My computer chooses this exact moment to make that dreaded sound – the one that means Windows 98 is having an existential crisis! The screen freezes, and I watch in horror as my carefully organized playlist vanishes into the digital void. I resist the urge to cry or throw something, mainly because Dad has already hidden anything throwable ""in preparation for Y2K-related civil unrest."" Instead, I do what any tech-savvy teenager would do: I blow on the keyboard like it's a Nintendo cartridge and restart the system.

The familiar startup sound plays, but something's different. The desktop icons have rearranged themselves into what looks like a smiley face. I didn't even know they could do that. Kevin would probably say it's a sign of the coming technopocalypse, but I choose to take it as Windows trying to be encouraging. ""Thanks, little buddy,"" I mutter, patting the monitor like a pet. The screen promptly goes blue.

While waiting for the second restart of the day, I decide to check our party supplies. The phone rings just as I'm halfway through counting paper cups. It's Maria again, this time calling from a payphone because her Nokia ran out of battery. ""There's no cheese balls anywhere!"" she reports, panic rising in her voice. ""But I found something better – you know those new Bugles chips? They're like tiny edible party horns!""

""Perfect!"" I exclaim, adding 'Bugles' to my Lisa Frank notebook with a glitter pen that's seen better days. ""Did you get the-"" The line crackles ominously, and suddenly I'm hearing what sounds like a crossed connection to someone's weather report. ""-batteries?"" I finish, mostly for my own benefit.

My computer finally whirs back to life, but now Winamp is convinced all my music files are actually text documents. I click on ""All Star"" by Smash Mouth, and somehow end up opening a Word document containing nothing but the letter 'Q' repeated for seventeen pages. Kevin would definitely have a theory about this.

Speaking of Kevin, he just ICQ'd me his latest Y2K survival tip: apparently, we should all synchronize our watches to ""atomic time"" to prevent temporal anomalies at midnight. When I point out that none of us own atomic watches, he suggests we use the speaking clock as a reference. I don't have the heart to tell him that our rotary phone can't do touch-tone dialing, so we can't even access the speaking clock. He's probably already building a sundial in his backyard just in case, I told myself, to which I hear my dad from behind me somewhere: ""Brilliant idea Katalina! Why didn't I think of that first?! On it as soon as the ground dries up!"" I sighed! I need to be more careful and stop adding fuel to his paranoia-fueled fire.

Mom pokes her head into my room, looking concerned. ""Honey, your father is installing a hand-crank generator in the garage. Should we be worried about the party lights?"" Behind her, I hear Dad shouting something about electromagnetic pulses and disco balls. I make a mental note to hide the blender – last week he tried to convert it into an emergency radio.

The phone rings again. This time it's Sarah, calling from her new cellular phone that's approximately the size and weight of a brick. ""You'll never believe this,"" she says, her voice cutting in and out, ""but Jenny's stuck at – *static* – because her car's computer thinks it's already – *crackle* – January 1st, 1900!"" It's funny how on a phone with a round dial I can swear her voice sounds like it's coming through in squares! It must be the bits from the cell phone part of the conversation.

""Her car has a computer?"" I ask, baffled. My own car still has a manual choke and occasionally needs to be sweet-talked into starting.

""Yeah, it's super high-tech!"" Sarah's voice fades in and out like a radio station you can almost tune in. ""The dealer said it's – *buzz* – millennium compliant, but – *static* – something about the flux capacitor...""

I'm pretty sure cars don't have flux capacitors, but before I can point this out, there's a loud pop on the line and Sarah's voice is replaced by what sounds like someone's grandmother reading out a recipe for pound cake.

My computer beeps again – another ICQ message, this time from someone claiming to be Jenny, but the screen name is just a random string of numbers. The message reads: ""Help! Car possessed by Y2K bug! Dashboard claims it's 1900! Dad says horses were more reliable!"" I'm about to respond when my screen flickers and ICQ decides to change its language settings to what I think might be Finnish.

From downstairs, I hear the distinctive opening notes of ""Genie in a Bottle"" for what must be the hundredth time today. My sister Amy's voice follows, slightly off-key but making up for it with enthusiasm. ""MY BODY'S SAYING LET'S GO!"" she belts out, followed by what sounds like choreographed jumping. Mom's crystal figurines rattle ominously on their shelf. If the Y2K bug doesn't take us out, Amy's rehearsals just might.

""Amy!"" I shout down the stairs, ""Maybe save some of that energy for tonight?""

""I NEED TO PRACTICE!"" she yells back, ""THIS IS MY MOMENT!""

My computer makes that wheezing sound again, and I decide it's time for desperate measures. I launch the antivirus software Dad insisted on installing – it's some obscure program he found while deep-diving into Y2K preparation forums. The scan crawls along at the speed of continental drift, but eventually it finds something: apparently, we've been infected by ""Y2KREADY.exe,"" a suspicious file that came attached to an email about ""GUARANTEED MILLENNIUM BUG PROTECTION!!!"" 

A quick check of the email history reveals Dad's been downloading ""survival guides"" from someone claiming to be a ""former NASA engineer turned digital prophet."" Great. No wonder my computer's been acting like it's possessed – it's probably full of prepper malware.

While the antivirus does its thing and a defrag runs (watching those little blocks arrange themselves is oddly soothing), the doorbell starts ringing. The early guests have arrived, each bringing their own blend of excitement and Y2K anxiety. Kevin shows up first, proudly sporting what he calls a ""static-discharge prevention bracelet"" but what looks suspiciously like aluminum foil wrapped around his wrist. He's followed by Maria, triumphantly clutching bags of Bugles and wearing a t-shirt that reads ""Party Like It's 1999 (While You Still Can).""

Jenny finally arrives, after her dad managed to convince her car it wasn't actually in the Victorian era. Sarah comes bearing three different types of batteries ""just in case,"" and my computer chooses this exact moment to finish its defrag with a triumphant chime. The desktop icons are back to normal, Winamp is playing my carefully curated playlist (waiting for tonight, just like Jenny!), and even the dancing llama seems to have an extra spring in its step.

As more friends filter in, the house fills with the sound of multiple technological eras colliding – cell phones with their various musical chirps, the dignified ring of our rotary phone, the whir of my newly-cleaned computer, and yes, the opening notes of ""Genie in a Bottle"" as Amy prepares for her potential Plan D moment. Dad's doing one final check of his Y2K supplies in the garage, Mom's pretending not to notice that someone brought a bag of cheese balls despite the apparent nationwide shortage, and through it all, our faithful old cream-colored rotary phone sits on my desk, ready to dial us into whatever the new millennium might bring.

Looking back now, it's funny how we survived that night. The computers didn't crash, the world didn't end, and yes, Amy did end up performing ""Genie in a Bottle"" – though not because of technical failure, but because we all actually wanted to hear it. Even Dad had to admit, as midnight came and went with nothing more catastrophic than Kevin's static-prevention bracelet getting caught in Maria's hair, that maybe the world wasn't ending after all.
My old rotary phone still sits in my parents' attic, wrapped carefully in bubble wrap like a technological time capsule. Sometimes when I visit, I find myself reaching out to touch its cream-colored surface, remembering the weight of the handset, the sound of the dial's return, the way it connected us all despite its mechanical limitations. In today's world of instant messages, I miss that moment of anticipation between dialing and connection, that brief space where possibility lived in the ring of a bell.
Sure, we have it easier now. No more waiting for the dial to spin back, no more static on the line after a rain, no more crossed connections giving us accidental glimpses into strangers' lives. But sometimes, I wonder if we lost something too – that patience, that sense of mechanical wonder, that feeling of triumph when you finally got through to someone after trying three different phone numbers and two different technologies.
At least we have the memories: of a New Year's Eve spent between two centuries, of friends gathered around a computer that refused to die, of a rotary phone that kept spinning us forward into the future, one digit at a time. And somewhere, I'm pretty sure, Dad's sundial is still standing in the backyard, ready for the next time technology decides to test us.

Obviously putting together a fit like this made me feel like a million dollars unfortunately the locals at Starbucks instantly knew what was up. 

As I walked into the store a young child, couldn’t have been more than 3 stood up and yelled “look at that badge lmao” I couldn’t believe it. His mom screamed those were his first words. He wouldn’t stop pointing to the badge on the arm sleeve. I honestly thought it was Ok but if a baby can legit check it from 20 yards I’m not sure anymore. 

After that this dad wearing Nike monarchs came up to me and said who am I fooling with those pants, he said “you know that rep shit doesn’t have gore tex right? Good luck when you’re stuck in an avalanche pal”. He then walked off laughing with his Americano hot. 

At this point I wanted to kill myself but the community wasn’t done. Some girl with blue hair came over and told me the suede brushing on my Travis reps were wrong. She said “maybe if you had brushed it properly with a suede oil everyone here might not know you’re a broke b*tch” 

Everyone including the barista burst out laughing, I had to leave without ordering a coffee.

I decided that we sterilize (not using hydrogen peroxide or anything stupid), trim (as best as we could without hurting him) and bandage his neck so he could at least get by for the night since everywhere was closed and took him to the vet the very next day. His procedure went well and he had pretty much gotten over the anaesthesia by the time we got home (10 mins from the Vet).

1hyuxg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1hyuxg4/i_am_done_with_everything/,I am done with everything ,"Apologies for the long post.

I don’t even know where to even get started. I had a major quarrel/argument with my mom, dad and younger brother on separate occasions all within the first few days of the year 2025 because everyone likes to use my stuff but nobody bothers to return it the same way and there’s the usual “you don’t do anything around the house”, “you are not at all helping us with anything” drama.

My school friend group has completely broken up due to some post-trip money disputes. We went on a 2 week vacation in December as it’s been a while since we went somewhere. 

My family and I moved away after my high school in 2016 so I thought this might be a good opportunity to reconnect with them as I don't have friends where I currently live so that was the only social circle I had. I used to sometimes meet with my school friends but it was just for a dinner to catch up.

I am getting a cold shoulder from the people I hangout with in the office because I declined their trip invitation to go to the above school friends trip. Except for the standup calls I am getting ignored and talked over, it’s like talking to a wall. I can literally hear them passing jokes and comments about me behind my back.

The one colleague who I thought was a good friend resigned and has also been ignoring me ever since I came back after the new years.This one indeed hurt me as I was the last one to know and that too I overheard it from someone. We used to share everything with each other and she was someone whom I would have loved to stay friends with and keep in touch even after the office. I thought the feelings were mutual. She was not in the trip fiasco so that couldn’t be the reason.

These are just the main events, it’s been like every step I take comes back to bite me in the b*tt one way or another. Like I wore new shoes and stepped on the poo, on the very first day. I decided to wear white shirt and got curry spilled on me. The coffee machine ran out of coffee and milk just as it was my turn to get the coffee….LITERALLY EVERYBODY ELSE GOT THEIR COFFEE BUT ME and this happened twice in the same day.

I cannot explain this but it’s been like a series of small bad things happening one after the other that has just infuriated me, sometimes I literally feel like someone is deliberately trying to make stuff hard for me on purpose for the sh1ts and giggles. At this point I feel even if I breathe wrong something bad will happen to me.

I could scratch a lottery ticket and my prize amount will be negative.

I haven’t spoken to anyone about this because there’s no one left to talk to who will understand, be it home or office. Things were already not running great prior to these events but now it’s gotten worse starting this year. I don’t know if I got that dawg in me to get through this and even if I do I don’t think the dawg is gonna survive till March at this rate.

I have never felt so alone in a room full of people that I know.

Heck now that I think about it I feel like I've never been actually loved or accepted by anyone in my life ever. I don't know what is wrong with me. Sometimes my anxiety spikes so high that I have to force myself to breathe harder. I think I'm done with everyone and everything.",1,1736598751.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Vardagar: enklare events som att Lära sig och lagar mat tillsammans, tävla i olika TV spel, workshops, hobby testa-på sessioner och liknande. Från början 2-3 events per vecka, resten av tiden kan man när som helst komma förbi, hänga dricka kaffe, umgås etc. 

Helger och Högtider: Större events, fester och firande, som halloween fest, midsommarfirande etc.

Hello everyone! 

Stockholm is full of newly moved-in, lonely and bored people - that's my theory anyway! I'm thinking of maybe starting a social club, like a ""Fritis"" for adults - where, for a monthly fee, you get access to a common space where different types of events will be organized: 

Weekdays: simpler events such as Learning and cooking together, competing in various TV games, workshops, hobby try-on sessions and the like. From the beginning, 2-3 events per week, the rest of the time you can drop by at any time, hang out, drinking coffee, socializing etc. 

Weekends and Holidays: Larger events, parties and celebrations, such as Halloween parties, Midsummer celebrations, etc. 

Location would be in central Stockholm

Question one: Would YOU be interested in something like that? In that case, which events would be most appealing? 

Question 2: How much would you be willing to pay per month for such a membership?

1hyuu0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1hyuu0u/landlord_has_breached_tenancy_how_do_i_take_legal/,Landlord has breached tenancy. How do I take legal action? ENGLAND,"Hello everyone. I’m currently renting a room out by way of universal credit. I signed an assured short hold tenancy 2 weeks ago. Since I’ve been here, I’ve had multiple issues that I have informed the landlord of, however he hasn’t fixed any of these issues and I am now suffering for it. 

When I moved in I noticed there was no heating in my room or the rest of the house. The coldest room is the bathroom. I can quite literally see my own breath in there and I’ve been avoiding showering (which is not ideal for me as my mental and physical health suffers if I cannot bathe adequately everyday) because of this. I asked my landlord how to work the heating. He did not respond for 3 days. When he did respond by text, he stated that he would come over the day after to fix it. When he came over, he then told me a different story and said that he would bring a maintenance man over to fix the problem in a weeks time. It has now been a week and this did not happen. they provided me with a very small plug in heater, but it barely does anything since it’s not a fan heater. It’s one of those mini portable heaters that looks like a mini radiator, but it’s very small.

 The landlords wife lives here in the property but she is not signed as my landlord on the contract. Last night I plugged in a fan heater that I borrowed from a friend because I am so unbearably cold that I cannot sleep at all and I have to wear multiple layers just to get to sleep. At 4am the landlords wife knocked on my door and asked if I’m using a fan heater, to which I said yes because I’m so unbearably cold it’s starting to make me feel unwell and I can’t sleep. She then proceeded to ask me not to use that and to use the original one they provided me with! She said that she can track how much the electricity is used and that she tops up the meter herself, and that this is costing her £10 a day which I felt might have been an over exaggeration? I then asked her to ask her husband (the landlord) to fix the heating if this is a big issue. I could barely sleep after this. I also looked up the minimum measurement requirement to rent a room out and it stated that this was 6.51square meters. I found a floor plan of this property online and sadly came to realise that my room falls under this. It is 5.02 square meters! No wonder I’ve been struggling to live in here. 

I’m also struggling and living out of suitcases as I have nowhere to store my clothes. I was told I’d be provided with a closet but this has not been provided at all. When I’ve tried to dry my laundry, this has become an issue because I’ve been hanging it out in the conservatory, however it is old in there so there is no proper insulation. This means that even after 2 days of my clothes hanging out to dry, they are still soaking and they smell of damp! 

This morning when I went downstairs to make a coffee, the landlords wife came out and apologised for her behaviour towards me last night and stated that she was sorry for her frustration towards me. She said that she can give me an electric blanket which means I won’t ever have to put the heating on in general. I stated that this is all good and well however what do I do about the other rooms in the house that I have a right to use, which are not being heated? And she just shrugged and said that she’d ask her husband about it. I said that I have a health condition which means my joints become unbearably painful and that I’ve had to go to the doctors recently because the cold is making it worse. That I had a flare up last night which is why I had to use the fan heater. She then proceeded to say that she still doesn’t want me to use the fan heater because of how expensive it is and she was tracking the electricity use last night when I was using it, and that she’s had to top the meter up out of her own pocket?! 

The landlord also informed me the other day that he would like me to book his booking.com guests in and out. He did not ask me to do this, in fact he practically ordered me to do so. 

Not only this, but my landlord admitted in writing to not putting my deposit in a TDP which I am absolutely livid about. I am in a very vulnerable position financially and health wise, so I’m going to have to move into a friends for the time being as I can’t afford to find somewhere else to live without getting my deposit and my first months rent back. I’m aware that I might have to take this to a small claims court, but where do I start and how do I begin this process with no money to my name? 

I am absolutely freezing cold and it’s minus 3 degrees outside, so to be told that I’m not allowed to use my fan heater which was quite literally my saving grace is abhorrent to me. I feel so hopeless and I just don’t know what to do. I have sent a message to my landlord about the conversation I had with his wife, outlining the fact that she informed me that in August, her husband told the builders not to replace the wiring in the radiator in my room because he didn’t plan to rent this box room out to anyone. Yet he rented it out to me, and still hasn’t fixed the issue?! So they had months to get this sorted and still didn’t do anything about it. I have tried to put the heating on myself and have recorded myself trying to work the thermostat, but it does not respond when I press any of the buttons and it just states “fault - 815” on it. Clearly the landlords don’t want me using the thermostat. 

If anyone could offer me advice with all of this context considered, I would be so grateful. Thankfully I do have evidence of these issues recorded in writing and some in photos. 

What steps do I have to take next? Thank you. ",4,1736598394.0,LegalAdviceUK,20,0.7,False
1hyutwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hyutwg/36m_4_months_out_of_an_abusive_relationship/,36m - 4 months out of an abusive relationship,"Hi All, 

Never thought I’d be on here posting but here’s my story. I’m a white 36 year old male in the US. 2 years ago when I was 34 I hit a rough patch in life where I was starting to have some health signs from years of high functioning alcoholism and got into $40k of debt from gambling on high risk stocks with borrowed money. Luckily I have a remote job that pays $100k so I still had a way to survive and turn it around. 

I started going to AA meetings, working out at the gym, and came up with a plan to build up my 401k so that I could pay off my debt. It was time of personal improvement and really addressing what had led to my alcoholism and decisions to take reckless financial risk instead of advancing my career more. I actually ended up getting into great shape and my outlook on life became healthier. 

About 5 months into my sobriety I started dating a Korean American woman who was 33. She was really beautiful, smart, educated and came from a somewhat wealthy family where all of the kids had gone to top colleges. She was leaving a $200k+ salaried job to start her own startup company. When we met it was awesome. We went on some cool trips together and had a really great chemistry and intellectual connection. A lot of women are judgmental that I live in a small studio apartment and that I’m not in a higher achieving career. But this woman fully embraced me. Early on we had some really cool experiences together. 

But there were some early red flags. She moved into my small studio apartment right away and never wanted to be a part. Suddenly we were locked at the hip and had almost no lives of our own. Then she started to show signs of extreme jealousy toward other women. 

Very early on before we were even official I told her that I had been dealing with feelings of sadness about my ex girlfriend from years ago. Also, before we were official I hung out one night with a female neighbor of mine who I had once made out with drunkenly years prior but had just become friends with. During that hang out all I talked about to the female neighbor was how much I really liked my soon to be new girlfriend. When my new girlfriend found out about these things she became very hostile and they became never ending topics of her jealousy. 

My best friends do an annual camping trip. Within two months of dating, I wanted to bring my new girlfriend to this trip. After I’d invited her, I found out that a girl I had hooked up with years prior, who never went on this annual trip, was going. I told my new girlfriend about this and asked her over and over again if she wanted us to cancel attending. But she assured me that she wanted to go and it wouldn’t be a problem. At the trip, the girl walked up and gave me a basic hug, and also interacted with me very briefly (like 20 seconds of interaction) around the campfire with 15 other people present. I thought this stuff wasn’t a big deal. Well, for the next year this became a topic of my new girlfriend’s obsession. She said that by interacting with my the other girl showed me special attention and that I disrespected my new girlfriend by not acknowledging her feelings. For the next several weeks all I heard were theories from my new girlfriend about why I probably have feelings for the other woman from my past. The constant negativity in my studio apartment stressed me out so much that I ended up drinking and breaking my nearly 8 months of sobriety from alcohol. 

Then things kept getting worse. My new girlfriend and I had a strong intellectual connection and we really opened up to each other about our pasts and had a lot of deep meaningful conversations. She took on a new $200k + year job, was finishing her masters and also working on her startup company, all in my studio apartment. Admittedly I sort of used her as a therapist and stayed up late talking every night for a couple of weeks or so. I’m sure she was exhausted and drained to be fair. One night she snapped on me and pinched me so hard that it left a mark on my arm and hurt. A year later she claimed that early in the relationship I kept her up for four weeks in a row using her as a therapist and that I manipulated her telling her that if she didn’t listen to me then she doesn’t love me. I think she is exaggerating some of this as she turned out to be very manipulative. Two days after the pinching incident I yelled at her and told her to never physically abuse me again. 

Months 2-6 of our relationship were really tough and she proceeds to be more physically abusive. She would constantly have jealous outbursts about other women that were completely irrational. She constantly accused me of checking out other women when I really wasn’t. We would be at the gym and she would come up to me and say she isn’t going to stand there while I smile at other women, then storm out of the gym. I wasn’t smiling at any women. 

She claimed that all of the women who worked at the front desk at the gym were sluts who wanted me. She didn’t like when I went on solo walks in my neighborhood because a lot of women in their 20’s live in my neighborhood and she thought that I would be checking them out. I once had to get up at a restaurant to go talk to the waitress about the bill and my ex girlfriend flipped out and said I was in love with the waitress. 

She had a friend who I had never even seen before. Like not even a picture. And she said that I was going to be in love with that friend if I ever met that friend. She put this on me hard for days. Like she was treating me as though I was already guilty of being in love with her friend when I hadn’t even met the friend. 

Eventually she wanted me to stop going to AA meetings because of a girl at the meetings who gave people hugs including me.

These are only a few examples. There are many more. 

One night I went out with my male friends and my phone died and I came back to my apartment later than I said I would. My ex smacked me in the head. Another time I forgot I was supposed to meet her at a store down the street after I went somewhere and I  walked home thinking she was still at my apartment. When she saw me she stomped on my bare feet with her shoes. Then she slapped me on another occasion when we were verbally arguing. 

Then there was all the breaking stuff. She found out my shoes were given to me by and ex and she took scissors and chopped the laces. Another time she broke my flower pot. Another time she broke my $200 headphones. Another time she broke my tv. Another time she broke my laptop. Another time she took a box of my family photos and threw it to the ground. Then, she found out I had a yoga mat from a previous ex, and she tore it in half. She apologized and replaced all of these things. 

A friend of mine who is a medical doctor and a very respectable guy/family man is a movie fan. He always recommends movies for me and other friends. He recommended an award winning movie for me to watch, so I suggested to my ex we should watch it one day. Well, in the movie one of the characters is a 45 year old man dating a teenage girl. It’s just a movie. The whole point of the movie it to show that he is predatory. And again, it’s a god damn movie. Well, my ex flipped the hell out. She started to conclude that my doctor friend must be sick in his head to recommend this movie and that maybe there is something wrong with me where I want to be like that 45 year old character one day when I am 45. I tried to explain this to my ex but she couldn’t see reasonably. And I had to deal with her basically accusing me of wanting to be like the guy in the movie. 

The relationship was fear based. When I told my ex that we should have some space, maybe for a week and she could go home it turned into a crazy event. She picked up a big knife and proceeded to stab holes in my leather couch. 

But not only was she capable of violence, she knew how to project and turn things around on me. One day I was at the counter cutting food with a knife. I was preparing food for us. While I was doing this my ex started in again about how I’m in love with some other woman. I couldn’t take it anymore and I yelled at her. I can’t remember what I said but it was normal yelling stuff. Like I was reacting. Well, days later she turned it around and said that I was yelling “with a knife in my hand” and that she was basically scared. But the reality was that I happened to be preparing food when this happened. 

These are only some examples of the crazy stuff I dealt with from her guys. It was tough. I was trying to break up with her for a long time but I was fear based. 

Her sister is 2 years younger than her, also 30’s and has had a boyfriend for 7 years. Well it turns out that the sister is the SAME way as my ex. When we were all together the 4 of us had a deep conversation about our similar relationship dynamics. Both sisters admitted that they have jealousy issues when it comes to other women, and that their Korean parents were always together growing up so they don’t ever want to be a part from their boyfriends, to the point of codependency. They admitted that they had issues. My ex had admitted her wrongs to me in the past as well. That same week, the sister and the boyfriend were at a coffee shop and the sister thought another girl checked out the boyfriend. He ended up being in trouble with her over this for the rest of the day. The sister had also been violent to the boyfriend to the point that he said he was “traumatized”. The boyfriend is also a white guy. The sister once slapped the boyfriend in the face and there was some “other stuff” she had done that they didn’t go into detail about. When I was alone with him he vented to me that he has thought about trying to get out of the relationship and that he feels trapped because when he goes to hang out with his friend the sister would block him from leaving. But he felt like there was nothing he could do because he’s a man and she’s a small woman and he’s afraid that he could get in trouble legally if he tried to physically move her out of the way. When his father died he took on a “man of the family” role to look after his younger sisters. His girlfriend (my ex’s sister) didn’t like that because she said he was starting to treat his sisters like girlfriends. Totally crazy controlling stuff.

So there was a family dynamic there. My ex and her sister’s parents had purchased two houses for the sister and the boyfriend, so I think he felt financially trapped. My ex’s parents wanted to buy her a house and she offered for us to have the house together. 

Anyway, outside of my ex’s abusive ways, there was some good stuff in the relationship. She reconnected me with my day who I hadn’t spoken to after a decade due to a falling out. And now he and I are spending time together regularly. She also understood my complicated background and did a lot of other good things. 

But her craziness was too much for me. I agreed to go to therapy with her and that backfired. She went from apologetic for all she has done to blaming me for a lot of it and saying that me keeping her up all night venting to her for weeks early in our relationship led to her pinching me and that I’m the psychological abuser. But she didn’t address the other instances of violence against me. 

She said that me venting to her all the time about my problems was the same as her putting all this stuff on me about other women. I tried to tell her that the difference was my stuff wasn’t about her and her stuff was always a rage against me. But she didn’t see the difference. 

She didn’t want me to hang out with one of my male AA friends and play sports together because he was a single father and had a bachelor personality and she said I would become like him if I spent time around him. 

I drank very heavily on and off for the final year of the relationship. The relationship lasted less than a year and a half. 

By the end I was so emotionally drained and terrified of her, and felt like I didn’t know how to get her away from me. I ended up gambling most of my $25k 401k saving away on stocks, in an effort to get some money so that I could have some financial mobility but I lost it. I started having some bad symptoms from alcoholism again.

She said she had a connection for me to get a much higher paying job and she put a resume together for me and tried to set me up with that professional connection. But, at that point I was so burned out and just wanted to get her away from me.
At the end I was begging her to get out of my apartment. I felt like she 

My ex had a high paying job but also wealthy parents. She paid for a lot of things like it was no big deal and paid for us to travel internationally together. But she didn’t fully understand what it’s like being in my position with much less in terms of financial support bases. Sometimes she did seem to understand. 

I finally got the therapist guy she had hired for us to see to help me break up with her in the most stable way possible. After that she came and got her stuff and acted stable. But for three weeks after the break up she texted me telling me I was a user and and abuser. 

I do miss her sometimes because outside of all of the crazy stuff I described, there was a really really really good connection there. But unfortunately, the crazy stuff is part of who she is. And it ruined the potential. 

She had previously dated a doctor who she said punched her and raped her. And she reported him to this to the police. Then the guy who she dated after that (the guy right before me), who was a lawyer had cheated on her and another girl (was dating her and another girl at the same time). She said he texted her around the time we were breaking up, and it made her remember a traumatic event she had compartmentalized, that a sexual act he did with her was non consensual. So she went to the police and reported him for rape as well. So she’s reported the last two boyfriends before me for rape and filed restraining orders against them. 

Anyway, that’s all. I am now getting sober again and considering filing for bankruptcy because I’m in a worse financial spot than I was when I met her. She tore down my whole structure. Lesson here, don’t let a woman move in with you too fast and don’t let anyone tell you what to do or control your life. 

Within 5 months of dating she was bullying me about a plan to start having kids within a year. When I told her I wanted to use protection (condoms) again, she would get really nasty with me and act like I was a bad guy. lol. 

I’ve looked online and her business appears to be going well. I’m actually happy for her and hope that she can resolve her issues.

And that’s all. That’s my vent. Thanks for reading. ",3,1736598382.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I woke up a bit grumpy so decided to order breakfast from McDonald’s. Time passed (quite a while, tbh, making me more grumpy), and I finally got an alert that the driver was near. I then got a message, ""I've Arrived.""

I looked out and saw a car in the car park. I replied to the message with the route to my door (which is in my delivery instructions on the app). They played dumb and said that they didn’t know the way. I described in more detail based on where I could see their car and asked if they could please deliver it. They insisted that I go meet them. I insisted that they deliver it as I wasn’t fully dressed (it’s very cold outside, I wasn’t wearing socks and shoes). They insisted that I go to meet them. I pointed out that I had selected delivery to the door in the app. They just... sat in the car for a bit longer, canceled the automatic phone call that Uber attempts before it even rang on my phone, marked the food as delivered, and drove off.

I assumed that, as delivering food was literally their job and that I had selected for the food to be delivered to my door, that their job was to deliver the food to my door. That made them very unprofessional, and in my grumpty state I also assumed that I would get a refund. Well, Uber declined a refund as the driver had waited for the allowed time.

Probably my fault for not reading the fine print (who does), but I really couldn’t be bothered. I ordered food to avoid leaving my flat. 

I’m mildly out of pocket, but actually more pissed off about how ordering something for delivery doesn’t actually mean delivery.

I’d try to raise a payment dispute with the payment provider. The one in question is generally quite good at taking the side of the consumer. It’s probably my fault for assuming I’d be protected by the Consumer Rights Act / Breach of Contract rules, but frankly I'm less sure now. I can’t be bothered with that hassle over a sausage egg McMuffin, a couple of hashbrowns, and a coffee. If I did raise one, they'd probably delete/blacklist my Uber account.

The moral of the story is probably not to use Uber.",20,1736597776.0,mildlyinfuriating,19,0.76,False

I would appreciate your help dialing in this coffee:

Roast date: 20.12.2024
Roast: Very light (onmi-roast)
Basket: High extraction basket
Weight in: 14,9 g
Weight out: approx. 38 g
Machine: Profitec Go
Grinder: Eureka Mignon Single Dose
Extracting temperatures: Tried with 93 °C and 95 °C.

I have a lot of experience with this equipment, and even with light roast usually have no issues.

It was difficult to dial in from the beginning. Issues: Had to go really fine to get to 30 seconds extraction time; secondary issue is I had to reduce the dosage - usually for this basket and very light roast I use about 15,3 grams, but in this case had to go down to 14,9 grams which is unusual.

No taste no aroma. It is like an infused piece of wood. It shall be very acidic and fruity.

Options are: extracting more (something like 42 grams out?), and/or increasing the temperature?

What are your thoughts?

Many thanks in advance for your support.

Can you suggest me a few options for a budget up to 350$. I have seen people recomending DF54, and the Breville Smart Grind. Which one is best for the money?",1,1736597533.0,espresso,0,0.67,False

I know men and women go through this. I have been on bumble for a year now and have had very little conversations with women on bumble. I get lot's of matches but most of them expire after 24 hours because they will not talk back. The few that have i had a great back and forth with one and invited her out to a coffee date. She ended up standing me up and blocked me on everything. The other few i talked to got sexual very fast early in the conversation. As a man who is looking for a serious relationship and wanting a family one day i got one night stand red flags all over them. That's all i have had in a year's time and so far this year is not off to a great start. Had 5 matches yesterday and they are about to expire. I always start the conversation with something witty and based on their profile. I hope my luck changes but everyone please do not under estimate if you can find a man or woman who actually talks back, has a good back and forth with you and seems like they are not looking to just get in your pants.",5,1736597398.0,Bumble,2,1.0,False
