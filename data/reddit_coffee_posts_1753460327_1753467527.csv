After going live, I received an email from them stating that the book had some issues with the title beeing too similar with other works on the platform or something related to my name. I said ro myself it's fishy, but ok. I cooperated with the support team sending even a photo of my government issued ID and screenshots of my work and the whole process it was made. They did not accept and I said then delete the book from the platform, the support told me that they can only block the title and I agreed and asked if it would cause any fhrther problems and they said no, that it will be ok. I said to myself that it was an odd situation and maybe I missed something and they know better since I was a beginner back then. A month later, my second book was finished (a romance novel as the first one), I uploaded the book and it was a success, it remained up and ready to be discovered. Made a website, added the KDP link to my books (I was planning to upload more, I was pretty confident that this is just the beginning of something beautiful)   promoted the second book on social media, everything was going great until monday when I received the disturbing email which stated ,,misleading metadata"" and from here it begins the true horror story. Immediatly I responded and provided evidence of originality, proof of website ownership and even screenshots from the previous cases but I kept receiving the same answer that the decision is final and I will not be able to make an account ever again. I sent another email stating again the facts as they were, sent the same proofs again, received the same email stating that account closure is final. Now, I sent them again an email asking for a reevaluation by a real human and not a bot, and let's see if they will answer. I have other works of mine published on other platforms as well, and never had any issues with anything I uploaded until I decided to upload to Amazon as well. So, how come other books on other platforms, written by me word by word, had no issues and when I put another book on Amazon suddenly nothing is good about it? I have to mention that I started my writing carreer when I was in the university, writing each morning a page or two while drinking coffee and the ideas piled up and got outlines as well. But only two years ago I started to publish for real. At this point I am not even know what will happen next, but I made up my mind and I will not be uploading any other books on KDP even if Jeff himself comes to my door to beg me to upload a book on their platform. I will keep publishing on the other platforms and build my carrer as an author outside their platform. 
I just wanted to share this story for other authors to be warned that even if you are correct as myself and do everything as they said, your account is in danger. So, be carefull out there and be aware of what are signing up for. KDP is a jungle and there are rules that can change over night. As far as I'm concerned, I will tell this story whenever I will have the chance. I am angry and dissapointed at this point, but here we are. ",1,1753467362.0,KDPclosedmyaccount,0,1.0,False

My original post:  
  
""Already seen a couple of posts on Ryan and Haleys unhealthy diet, but wanted to expand on this - their breakfast every day basically consists of cheesy and bacon McGriddles and loads of sugary iced coffees (vanilla and cookie dough), they drink soda pop instead of water all day, lunch is usually either pizza, burger, fries or hotdog (bought or frozen) and dinner consists of joyride, popcorn, potato chips, candy, ordered or canned foods in variation.   
  
***To me, this contradicts the mission statement of joyride, when Ryan as the frontfacing figure eats insanely processed, unhealthy junkfood all day every day. It seems disingenuous and makes kind of a joke out of the conviction behind the candy, which is why I'm so confused they are broadcasting it like this.***  
  
People have argued Ryan and Haley are still young and work out, but that doesn't change that there are still close to no nutrients in what they consume, they still need to be fueled with *something*, Apart from the argument how millions of kids are watching this and hopefully don't get inspired by it. I understand healthy options are harder to come by on a roadtrip, but it's still up to you if you broadcast your junkfood consumption as excessively, as Ryan did.  
  
***Their diet also has a significant impact on their focus, attention, sleep and energy, things you'd think are crucial for a series that mainly takes place on the road, regarding safety and sustainability.***

My second criticism would be the constant Mr.Beast glazing, that later turned into roasting. It's like Ryan knows Beast sits on a ton of money and wants him to get to donate more by glazing him, and given he hasn't reacted ever since, then turned to roasting to maybe ""challenge"" it out of him - just to still be met with silence. I think it just paints perfectly who Beast is:   
  
***He wanted to be the first one to donate to the series, because it benefited his first-at-everything image, look at me, the high baller! But since then ghosted it (no matter how hard Ryan pushed Feastables or mentions Beast in every second video) because he didn't care to begin with.***   
  
It's just increasingly hard to watch Ryan fight for a narcissists attention in all ways he can think of, although that dude already got what he wanted.""",1,1753467312.0,mrbeastsnark,0,1.0,False

*Where the Pirates‚Äô offense is slower than a snail on a coffee break, and the Diamondbacks‚Äô pitching is tighter than a single‚Äôs dance floor at a wedding.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Why Arizona‚Äôs Pitching Looks Like a Fort Knox Vault

The Arizona Diamondbacks (-132) are favored to win this matchup, and the math backs it up. With Ryne Nelson on the mound‚Äî8 of his last 11 starts have allowed **one or fewer runs**‚Äîthe Diamondbacks‚Äô pitching staff is as reliable as a Swiss watch. Nelson‚Äôs ERA this season? Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs not the kind of number you want to see on a speeding ticket. Meanwhile, the Pirates‚Äô offense is so anemic they‚Äôd struggle to score against a **team of kindergarten dodgeball players**. Pittsburgh averages just **3.4 runs per game**, last in MLB, and their home-run total (or lack thereof) could power a wind turbine.

The totals line sits at **8.5/9.0 runs**, with the under priced attractively. Arizona‚Äôs pitchers (hello, 2.63 ERA from Merrill Kelly in July) and the Pirates‚Äô feeble bats make this a **screaming under bet**. Imagine a game where the combined score is lower than the number of errors both teams committed last week. It‚Äôs not a stretch.

### 2. Digest the News: Pirates‚Äô ‚ÄúSweep‚Äù of the Tigers Was a Fluke (Probably)

Yes, the Pirates just swept the Tigers‚Äîa team that‚Äôs basically the Cleveland Browns of baseball. But let‚Äôs not confuse a **sudden burst of luck** with a blueprint for success. Detroit‚Äôs pitching staff is so bad, they‚Äôd probably lose to a team of retirees with a slide rule. The Diamondbacks? They‚Äôve won 50% of games when favored this season, and their offense slugs at a **.446 clip**, second in MLB. Players like Eugenio Su√°rez and Josh Naylor are hitting like they‚Äôre in a video game on ‚ÄúGod Mode,‚Äù while Geraldo Perdomo‚Äôs defense is so smooth, it makes a greased-up otter look clumsy.

On the flip side, Pittsburgh‚Äôs ‚Äústars‚Äù are‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not. Oneil Cruz‚Äôs power is fun

The sunset cut slip thin across the horizon before I took my last exit. Nothing in the world rests on the eyes like the gold made over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I‚Äôve been driving for fourteen hours, and though I‚Äôve had a few stops for gas, food, and coffee, this is the first actual stretch of rest I‚Äôve been afforded. You can call me Red, my car is an abused Nissan Cube , her name is Darla. We live together. I‚Äôve been homeless for six years now.

Despite how bad it might seem living the way I do. I‚Äôm not all gloom and misery. Life is simple, I drive places, I make money to get gas, and then I drive to more places. I‚Äôve seen more countryside than most folks dream about. I‚Äôve been on more roads than anyone I‚Äôve ever heard of. The only thing I worry about is the closest pit-stop.

I‚Äôve got Freedom from everything I could ever worry about. Jean Paul Sartre said we‚Äôre all doomed to be free. I disagree, I think the real doom is knowing you¬†*could be*¬†free, and knowing you‚Äôll never take the chance. Don‚Äôt like your job? Quit. Don‚Äôt like your family? Leave. Don‚Äôt like your friends? Stop seeing them. You don‚Äôt wanna live with the consequences of those choices? Don‚Äôt make em.

Some nights pass quickly, Others nights aren‚Äôt as easy. Though I chose to live this way, the primal jelly inside my skull, the Part of me as old as stone, weeps like a sickly child for company. Humans are social animals after all. I hate those nights. To put my head at ease, I play a game with other drivers.

Only on the lonely roads. I‚Äôll find myself a car, and I‚Äôll trail behind them. I don‚Äôt ride their ass or anything, I just stay by them. They have no idea where I‚Äôm going, they have no reason to fear me, they have nothing to say. When you‚Äôre flying down Route-66 for three hours at four in the morning, having a car to drive with lets it all melt into halcyon road trips. A few hours in, they always peel away and then I‚Äôm alone, the jelly in my head is satisfied.

Sometimes I run into someone else doing the same. A car as rough as mine, a driver as tired as me, and trailing along as we both wait to go our separate ways. Whenever I run into a person like this, I do my best to follow their road as long as I can. This is a connection that means more to me. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm not the only ghost on the road. My life might sound a bit strange to people not in my place, though my place is a strange one to be.

Recently, I ran into a ghost who felt like a mirror on wheels. They drove a Black 1970 Ford pickup which wore its age like a whore wears perfume. The car felt like part of the road, and as I trailed behind I started to lose track of the hours. It felt different than the other people I‚Äôve seen. Once Darla needed fuel, I pulled away so I could get her what she needed. I figured this shadow of mine would want their privacy back. Although to my surprise the Ford followed.¬†

What was odd, was that at first I didn‚Äôt feel uneasy about it. The roads were kind, the weather still. Stars poured out across the night, our tires sung an empty song to the endless desert all around us. After a while I felt at home, and that‚Äôs when it terrified me. I felt a shackle snap shut around my throat. For a moment I felt like I had a brother again. With a lonely Gas Stop in the distance, I resolved to leave this Stranger, to forget this feeling.

I had walked into this nowhere Gas Station, the place reeking of cleaning chemicals and stale air. Crowded Aluminum Isles packed to bursting with fossilized candies, off brand Beef Jerky, toiletries, and Cough Medicine. The Clerk was a woman in her fifties. Hair like dry white grass, skin like tissue stained by time. Her Sun-bleached uniform told of decades in the same place. She drank black coffee from a Styrofoam cup. The lines on her face dug in like canyons, cracked beside eyes mourning a life she could have had. She reminded me of my Mother.

She politely pretended not to watch as I roamed the isles, gathering what I needed. Bottled water, jerky, crackers, instant coffee, razors, shaving cream, batteries, duct tape, pliers, pills for caffeine, and sleep. Even with her in the room, I finally felt alone again.

‚Äú30 on 5.‚Äù I grunted, placing my items on the counter. I didn‚Äôt want to speak, my throat was dry.

She looked at me with those sad eyes, and smiled. ‚ÄúGot everythin‚Äô ya need hun?‚Äù her voice was milk-candy, and cold hands.

I couldn‚Äôt muster much of a smile. I just nodded as pleasantly as I could. After the Driver followed me, I was here to forget. Part of me felt like I should help her, get some of the sadness out of her eyes somehow. Maybe a kind word, a smile, something? She told me what I owed.

‚ÄúYou have a nice day now darlin‚Äô.‚Äù she smiled, and sipped her coffee.

I went back to my Darla, content to get back on the road. Before I got to her door, the smell of leather and whiskey hit the back of my throat like buckshot.

‚ÄúHeya Tex, nice drivin‚Äô back there.‚Äù said the man ‚ÄúFancy we getting‚Äô to the same spot. Lass at the counter looks half dead tho, she any help?‚Äù

For a moment I thought he was in my head. He was layers of fine denim worn down by decades of use. Dark as a shadow, and slim as a knife. His face was a road map written by tobacco stains and bad choices. He had a voice like cigar smoke, and with that Black Ford behind him; I knew who he was right away. The Driver found me again.

I couldn't move as His eyes cut through me, they were a shade of ice. Two frozen mountaintops far into a valley I'd never want to visit. His stare nailed my tongue to the roof of my mouth, though the jelly in my head pried it loose.

¬† ‚ÄúYep‚Äù I said, my throat dry, my voice disused.

‚ÄúGood to hear, damn it‚Äôs been what, twelve hours since my last stop?‚Äù his accent was thick with brambles and hickory. ‚ÄúWhere you headed there Tex?‚Äù

‚ÄúNowhere.‚Äù I replied. The Jelly was feasting on this, Something about this man was lighting torches of the past in my head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm headed past Nowhere myself, you lookin‚Äô fer company? Since we‚Äôre both goin‚Äô the same way figured I‚Äôd ask.‚Äù his voice became a shot of whiskey. It went down just as well.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù was all I could manage. That word slipped out of me, because under his teeth, inside his tongue, I could hear my older brother. The last time I had seen him was at his funeral. He was wearing all black too.

‚ÄúWell alright then! Lemme go check in the pit, grab some grub, and get in the ol‚Äô beater. I‚Äôll follow yer‚Äô lead.‚Äù The Driver sauntered through the Nowhere Station like a cowboy into a silent movie.

As I fed Darla, I sat in a stunned silence. I felt violated, I felt lost. What part of my head is so fragile that it broke so easily. It was years since the Funeral. It has been over a decade since Family rang in me as anything other than regret. In the quiet pump of the gas, I heard my Father, in the stillness of the air I heard my Mother. In my breathing, was their violence. I thought I would never think of them again.

The Driver was still inside, I could see him through the window. He spoke to the sad-eyed cashier, and for an instant made eye contact with me over her shoulder. It felt like a Rattlesnake at my feet. He smiled like a razor-blade, and waved. I raised a hand, and waved back. Darla finished eating, I put the pump away. My hands began shaking. I drove away without a word. I did not wait for this shadow of a man to leave the building.

I told myself I was seeing things, that it was exhaustion clouding my vision. I knew there were only two people in that building. There were three cars in the lot. One for the Cashier, one for the Driver, one for me. I knew this as sure as I knew the sound of tires on asphalt. But in that moment when the Driver smiled, just over his shoulder, I saw my brother staring back at me.

I drove quiet, I focused on the wheel in my hands. I felt like a man falling off a building, trying to argue the ground out of the way. After two more hours, I decided to rest. I decided to leave the Man in Black behind me.

Another day dawned in gold through Darla‚Äôs windshield. The Sleep crusted in my eyes was blinked away through dry coughs, and gulps of water. I brushed my teeth, stepped onto the side of the road, pissed into the dirt, and was ready to drive again. I had gone north the whole of yesterday, up into the redwoods. Those trees were monolithic things. They might as well be ageless. Towering signposts to the past. They grew taller, and more vibrant than any other tree I have ever seen.

As I pulled back onto the road, Darla and I had peace again. I went through Jerky, listened to the Radio prattle on about the latest news, the traffic ahead, and the weather to come. Winding through the mountains, I saw car after car parked to admire the wilderness. People walking through Footpaths doing the same thing I am, looking for places in between their responsibilities.

People come to nature for freedom. They walk through the woods, light campfires, all to forget the places they left. The irony is their homes are no less natural than the woods. People pretend that humans aren‚Äôt nature‚Äù, but we are. No human building is different from a beaver dam. No cellphone is different than a whale song.

Humans make up rules, and gods, and stories to create something that comes out of nothing to save us from our freedom. Without these ideas, people have to face that just like any Lion starving because it can‚Äôt catch a gazelle, or any deer eaten by a pack of wolves, nothing comes out of the sky to stop it. Everything on earth is free, we only trick ourselves into thinking we aren‚Äôt. When I saw a familiar Black Ford in my rear-view mirror, I was reminded of that reality.

While I do my best to vanish into the road, The Driver following me might as well have put the sun on my back. His car reeked of timeless demands for attention. Everyone we passed looked. Everyone waved, everyone could tell he was following me. He drove in sync, never too close. He followed me for six hours, I did my best not to panic.

I told him I was going nowhere. He told me the same. There was nowhere I could stop which he couldn‚Äôt stop at too. He stuck through every red light, every turn, every detour. As time passed with the Driver behind me, his presence brought back memories. My brother teaching me to drive, my first car, the first girl I kissed. The first person I left on the side of the road. As the miles of memories piled up, I found myself as the child in my Father‚Äôs back seat.

Even alone with my Darla, I began to hear my parents argue. A memory so vivid I could taste the fear in my mouth. Each curse, each strike, each moment of fear tangible. Alone in the care of two people who knew nothing about care. The dull thud of my Father‚Äôs fist on the back of my Mother‚Äôs head. I could smell the rain on the road, feel the biting winter through the cracked windshields.

Beyond my memories rain began to pour. Darla provided a clear windshield, though couldn‚Äôt hide the shadow-car behind me. I hit a pothole, and in the noise I heard the cracking thump of my Mother‚Äôs face into the hood of my Father‚Äôs Volkswagen. The sound of her choking as his hands gripped around her throat.

Time passed overhead, the gauges on my dashboard and the weight of my eyelids began to beg for peace. The sound of childhood began to ring louder and louder. No matter the music I put on, no matter the places I drove; the Driver‚Äôs presence dragged every moment of my life back to me. The blur of tears obscured the road, Darla couldn‚Äôt clear my vision. My older brother's voice rang in my head as he held a knife to my Father‚Äôs throat.

‚ÄúTouch her again, and I‚Äôll fucking kill you.‚Äù he was 13, I was 9. That was the day I learned how free we really are.

I pulled off to a rest station. Parking spaces, faded signs, fetid toilets, and rotten showers. It was a crypt for the American Dream, a good place to bury these memories. Dutifully, the Ford pulled in as well. It parked with a modest distance, and the Driver got out. A cigarette in hand, he leaned on his hood and brought smoke to the air around him. I caught my breath as the Driver watched Darla and I.

Darla was warm, though I needed air to wash out all the dread in me. As I opened the door, the moist cold rushed at me like a bitter hug. The strike of it shook my senses back. I reached out my limbs to bring them back to life, and readied to cut ways with this mystery man. The downpour had started in earnest now, puddles underfoot forming a shallow lake. Even in the shadows, the smoke, and the rain, I could see the Driver‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúBout time you stopped Tex! Wheew, you weren‚Äôt kiddin‚Äô bout nowhere.‚Äù He called across the rain.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù I said as I called back as I closed the distance between us.

‚ÄúWe bout there yet? Or we getting some sleep before the next stretch?‚Äù a dry chuckle cracked through his words.

‚Äúwhy are you following me?‚Äù I asked, I wanted to get through this.

He smiled.

‚ÄúI was waiting‚Äô fer you to ask me that.‚Äù his voice put the rattlesnake at my feet again ‚ÄúI wanted to know why¬†*you*¬†were following¬†*me.*‚Äù Then his words made the snake bite.

‚ÄúYou noticed.‚Äù I tried to sound sure of myself, though the venom in his words already had me.

‚ÄúHard not to, yer car ain‚Äôt exactly subtle.‚Äù he nodded towards where I was parked. ‚ÄúHow long you been out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúLong enough to know I like to be left alone.‚Äù I replied, as I moved between the Driver and Darla.

‚ÄúWell then you ain‚Äôt been out long enough, you drive like a stalker.‚Äù He tossed his cig, and lit another.

I wasn‚Äôt going to argue, I just wanted him to go away. I had no idea what to say, how to handle this. It was years since I was last in a place like this, years since I left my Mother behind. Left everything behind. I was rusty, before I could say anything, he spoke again.

‚ÄúYa don‚Äôt want me to follow ya? Fine, I‚Äôll be on my way. S‚Äôjust when I noticed you, I felt like you might¬†*need*¬†someone to drive along with.‚Äù He offered me a smoke.

Without thinking I took it. He handed me a lighter, we both smoked in silence for a time. As we did I could feel the turn of the earth under my feet.

‚ÄúI appreciate it, and yes sometimes I just need friends on the road.‚Äù I finished smoking, threw the butt away, and began to walk back to Darla. ‚ÄúThanks for the smoke, but I prefer more anonymous company. I‚Äôm leavin‚Äô. Don‚Äôt fuckin‚Äô follow me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell Yer welcome Tex! thanks for the miles.‚Äù The Driver stood there, His eyes still fixed.

When I got behind the wheel, I realized why the Driver‚Äôs eyes bore through me. Why did his voice put such fear in my veins? I pulled out from the rest stop, and went along to find a better place to sleep. When I think back to the night My Father left, It‚Äôs not the screaming, the tears, the threats, or even the rain I remember most. It‚Äôs my Father‚Äôs eyes. The way he looked at me as I curled into myself in the back seat. The way he looked at me with his eldest son holding a knife to his throat. The way we locked eyes before he walked out into the night. The Driver, with all his mystery, all the smoke, all the miles on his face had those same eyes.

I got my silence back after a while. I spent time winding through the mountains, looping back into the Redwoods again, and again. Any back road I could find, any isolation from the world I could afford myself. Even in my freedom, the meeting with that man made me feel naked. I‚Äôm no longer afraid of the freedom I have. I haven‚Äôt been for years. The only thing that scares me, is the freedom other people hold. Nature is fair, you either are or you aren‚Äôt. You are safe, or you are not. You are hungry, or you are sated. You are alive, or you are dead.

The road, for all I talk about the freedom it has, does come with rules. Speed limits, traffic laws, parking restrictions. It‚Äôs an extension of Humans nature into Nature. It‚Äôs freedom with training wheels. I forget that from time to time. I glorify my disconnection from it all, but I‚Äôve still got Darla. I‚Äôve still got the road. I wanted to shake off the night, to shake off the Driver. So I found a mountain trail made of dirt. I found somewhere more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù than ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù. The search brought comfort, reassurance.

In the early house of the night I found myself on the dirt I was hunting for. A shoulder I could rest on. Trees enveloping me away from anything that could chain me to the past. As the rain let up, I was comfortably alone again. Darla kept me safe, old blankets kept me warm. I was eager to get the night behind me, and move on to another place ahead. As I thought of places to get next as everything went blissfully black.

I don‚Äôt know how many hours later, I woke up. A pure still dark mixed with the sound of branches in the wind was everything. I felt confused, it was still night, the stress of everything must have made me sleep like shit. I reached for the wheel, but found nothing. I figured I must‚Äôve just been confused. That‚Äôs when I realized I was unexpectedly cold. I began to notice how different the air felt around me. Then I saw it, Darla‚Äôs doors were open, and I was yards away on the ground.

My eyes widened as I began to adjust to the dark. My legs were jelly as I rose to my feet. Fear ate at my stomach as blood rushed through me. Slowly, I walked towards Darla. The Driver and Passenger door were wide open, she was still off. I scrambled to the driver's seat, and shut the doors as fast as I could. I checked the back seat. I locked every door. My heart thundered in my chest, Darla‚Äôs engine roared to life to match it. Although before I could drive away, I saw it.

Darla‚Äôs headlights cut the dark ahead of me, and there he was. Between the Redwoods, towering into the night sky, The Driver stood in front of his car. Parked just at the edge of the shoulder, He puffed his cigarette, and smiled.

‚ÄúHeya Tex.‚Äù he said, somehow clear as day.

I fled from everything. I drove as far, and as fast as I could. I didn‚Äôt pay attention to which state I ended up in, I didn‚Äôt care about where I was going. All I could do was peer over my shoulder begging for the man in black to not appear.

1m96jnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/thecranberries/comments/1m96jnr/the_cranberries_best_era/,The Cranberries' best era?,"I discovered The Cranberries when I was 15. That was in 2004. They were the first band I discovered ""on my own""; I hadn't really been listening to music intentionally before; I just listened to whatever music was on in the background. The Cranberries were a huge discovery for me and a gateway to some other similar bands that are still some of my top 10 favorite bands (The Sundays and Sixpence None The Richer, to name two). I loved all their music, except for 'Wake up and smell the coffee'.

In the years since then, I've re-evaluated their albums and came to the conclusion that they - for me personally - lost their magic after the 90s. Both 'Everybody else is doing it...' and 'No need to argue' are stellar albums. I think of those two albums as masterpieces. Back then (and now still) I do really like 'To the faithful departed' and 'Bury the hatchet'; both those albums have some amazing songs on them, that still hold up today.

But I really feel like the band lost something after that. 'Wake up and smell the coffee' didn't do anything for me and I remember how disappointed I was when 'Roses' was released. 'Roses' was supposed to be a return to the sound of their debut album, but I just don't hear it. The songs sound so lame and genetic to me. And wtf with 'Schizophrenic playboy'? That's just awful. And though I think it was nice for fans after Dolores had passed and though they did a good job with the material they had (unfinished songs, unfinished demos, unfinished vocals), 'In the end' is just too repetitive for me to enjoy.

I always wondered... What if the band took a break after 'No need to argue'? It's a known fact Dolores was depressed when they were recording their third album, 'To the faithful departed'. She was depressed, she battled with anorexia,... I feel like, if the band took a break they would have found their spark again. Maybe their third album would have sounded a lot different. Less harsh. Though I've always liked their third and fourth album, I feel like that was some breaking point for them. I wish they had taken some time off.

What is your most avorite and least favorite Cranberries era? Do you enjoy their output after the 90s?

I was so, so sad when Dolores died. Her and the band were my musical awakening when I was a teen. But realizing I would never hear new music by The Cranberries, made me realize they hadn't released anything I actually liked after'Bury the hatchet'.",1,1753467155.0,thecranberries,2,1.0,False

I had a lot of boundaries and restrictions and was not allowed a social life. Whilst I was cool for her to do whatever she wanted and trusted her. Only complaint I had besides the abuse was her financial decisions. But damn apparently you‚Äôre a control freak for offering to help her budget.

Hi all,

I play table tennis three days a week and on weekends, usually for about two hours each day. My coach trains me with both single-ball and multi-ball sessions, along with footwork drills. However, I'm having trouble managing my energy and get tired easily‚ÄîI lose all my energy in a short time. I'm usually in air-conditioned environments, so I tend to sweat a lot.

Does anyone have ideas or suggestions about what I should eat before playing table tennis?

Every day I currently have:
- Black coffee with no sugar
- Mixed nuts
- Red banana

Note: I had a double lung transplant in 2018 and am leading a healthy life with no issues. I chose table tennis as a physical activity to stay fit and am enjoying learning it as a hobby.

1m96hel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m96hel/she_stuns_the_world_summary_review_and_reading/,"She Stuns the World: Summary, Review and Reading Link Available","Late at night in a dimly lit bar, a wealthy young man clad in designer threads slid a document across the table to Athena Donovan.

""I'm engaged to the Kennedy's daughter. You're not their flesh and blood, so I need you to sign off on ending our engagement,"" he stated matter-of-factly.

""But hey, we could still mess around, right?"" he added, his voice dripping with nonchalance.

Athena, dressed in a light blue linen dress, sat opposite him. Her long black hair fell over her shoulders, her skin porcelain-smooth, and her eyes gleamed with a quiet fire.

As she watched him flaunt his riches, she couldn't help but think, 'Is this guy for real?'

He pushed another document her way along with a key card and car keys. ""This is for a property transfer. Live in the apartment for five years, and it's yours. Oh, and that brand-new Maserati downstairs? It's yours too if you sign these.""

Athena chuckled softly and then did the math. 'Five years as his side piece for a 600-grand apartment and a sports car worth 400 grand? That's barely 200 grand a year√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùless than 20 thousand dollars a month. And he expects gratitude for his 'generosity'?'

Her gaze unnerved him. He grabbed a wine glass, sipping a 2,000-dollar mouthful of wine, before continuing. ""Look, I get it, you're a proud woman. Signing this might sting a bit.""

""But let's be real√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùyour folks are broke. Five brothers, all cramped in some tiny house in the old quarter,"" he pressed. ""Trust me, you wouldn't last a day in their shoes. Take the flat and the car. You're gonna need them.""

Athena shot him a brief, scornful smirk, then leaned in to swiftly sign the documents.

Lucas Harper's grandiose promises, made during their courtship, now seemed laughable and vile, especially after his rush to call off their engagement upon learning she wasn't a true Kennedy.

Sickened by his charade, Athena was ready to bolt after just a short while.

Caught by her smile, Lucas leaned in, his face alight with desperation. ""Athena, I really give a damn about you. I can set you up for life if you just stick with me,"" he said, his voice thick with passion as he licked his dry lips.

""If you wanna have kids, I can look after them too. But they won't carry the Harper name,"" he added, clearly lost in his delusions.

Athena finished signing, tucked a copy into her bag, and stood. ""Mr. Harper, thanks for calling off the engagement. Goodbye,"" she said, turning to leave.

Lucas froze, then snapped back to reality as she started to walk away. ""Athena, you better learn your damn place!"" he yelled, rushing over and grabbing her arm.

""I'm the heir to the richest family in Kitmore City, not to mention handsome, generous, and a top grad from an elite foreign school. I've had women throwing themselves at me since I was a kid,"" Lucas boasted arrogantly. ""You should be grateful I'm even considering keeping you, you gold-digging impostor! If you walk out now, you'll regret it!""

Athena struggled briefly, then swiftly broke free. She flipped him off and spat at him before striding away.

Lucas clenched his fists, trembling with rage. ""Stop her!"" he bellowed.

Lucas had been pursuing Athena for three years but had never even held her hand.

'I can't just let her slip away,' he thought desperately. 'I need to spend one night with her, get it on tape, and show I'm still the most eligible bachelor in Kitmore City.'

His entourage, keen to impress, quickly blocked Athena's way, smirking. ""Athena, Mr. Harper has bent over backward for you. How can you be so cold and just leave?"" one sneered.

""If you're ditching him, at least throw the guy a bone. Show some damn appreciation for all he's done,"" another piped up.

Athena kept her cool, then glanced over their shoulders with a smirk. ""Matthew, you made it!""

# 2. Chapter 2

Hearing the name, Lucas and his cronies turned in shock.

Rumors had been flying that Matthew Graham, heir to the Graham family, had sneaked into Kitmore City. Every big shot in town, including their families, was scrambling for an intro.

But when they spun around, there was no sign of Matthew√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùjust the usual crowd. The elusive Matthew seemed nowhere in sight.

Lucas whipped back around to Athena. ""Where's Matthew Graham? Are you lying..."" he started, but trailed off as he realized Athena had used their distraction to slip away.

""Go! Downstairs, now! We've got to catch her!"" he ordered his group.

They muscled through the crowd and sprinted to the elevator, hitting the building's lobby in seconds, only to see Athena's modest black car pulling away.

""Athena, you can't run from me!"" Lucas screamed, chasing after her. He was left coughing in a cloud of dust as her car tore down the street. Furious, he wiped his face and glared at the fading taillights.

""After her!"" he roared between coughs before jumping into his Maserati to give chase.

Half an hour later, Lucas was still desperately combing the streets for Athena.

Meanwhile, Athena had already arrived back at the Kennedy family villa. After parking her car, she made a call. ""Blacklist the Harper family immediately,"" she instructed coldly.

""No invitations to any Vission Group events, no sales of Vission Group products, and bar them from entering any Vission Group properties."" With that, she ended the call and calmly walked through the villa's front door.

When Athena finally arrived, it was twelve minutes past midnight. Despite the Kennedys' reputation for living a healthy, disciplined lifestyle, the grand crystal chandelier was still casting a bright light across the living room.

As she stepped inside, she spotted Isaac Kennedy lounging on the large leather sofa, dressed in silk pajamas. His eyes were closed, seemingly at rest, and a stack of documents lay on the coffee table in front of him.

It was clear he'd been waiting for her. The moment he heard the door, he opened his eyes and asked with a concerned look, ""Athena Donovan, why are you back so late? Did something happen?""

Athena, wearing a polite smile, pretended not to notice his formal tone. ""Nothing too serious. I just signed the breakup agreement with Lucas. It's official√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwe're done.""

Isaac rarely called her by her full name, which made Athena wonder if he was subtly reminding her of her place in the family.

At her words, Isaac visibly relaxed, a slight smile curling at the corner of his mouth before he quickly composed himself again. ""Are you upset with us for not stepping in to save your engagement?""

""No,"" Athena replied sincerely, shaking her head slightly. ""I never had feelings for Lucas. If you hadn't forced me into this engagement a month ago, I wouldn't have even considered him.""

Back then, her grandmother had been critically ill, requiring a nearly impossible surgery. Since Athena was still a minor, she couldn't legally sign the consent forms. The Kennedys had taken advantage of the situation, using their signature as leverage to force her into the engagement.

Athena could've arranged the surgery secretly, but she hadn't seen the point in going through all the trouble. She knew she could end things with Lucas anytime, so she went along with the engagement without a fuss.

Isaac looked uncomfortable as he addressed the matter. After clearing his throat awkwardly, he said, ""I'm glad you don't hold it against us.""

""Please, have a seat. There's something we need to discuss,"" he added, motioning to the chair next to him.

# 3. Chapter 3

Athena sat gracefully on the edge of the sofa, her posture upright and poised, hands neatly folded in her lap.

Isaac said slowly, ""You'll be meeting your biological parents tomorrow. I've arranged for a driver to take you there, and there are gifts prepared for them.

""It's been years since you've seen your family, so make sure to spend time with them, get settled. Don't worry about anything here.""

Athena nodded, understanding. ""Thank you.""

Isaac gestured to the property transfer agreement lying on the coffee table. ""This house is a farewell gift from your mother and me. It's not brand new, but it's been kept up well and fully furnished. I hope it'll be suitable for you.""

Athena had already glanced over the agreement. The house was her childhood home, a small, worn-down apartment barely fit for living.

The Kennedys had held onto it, hoping for a payout from demolition or as a place for elderly relatives. Now, they were offering it to her as a symbolic gesture since neither of those plans had panned out.

She smiled politely. ""Thank you, Dad. But please keep the house for now. I'll let you know if I need it.""

A flicker of displeasure crossed Isaac's face, and his tone cooled. ""Fine. If you ever change your mind, just call Elias. He'll handle everything right away.""

Athena nodded again to show she understood.

After a brief pause, Isaac continued, ""Tomorrow's gonna be busy. I've asked Mia to pack your things. Get some rest tonight, and leave early tomorrow so you don't keep your parents waiting.""

Athena wasn't sure if her biological parents were as eager as the Kennedys to see her go, but she could tell Isaac and his wife certainly were.

Standing up, she said politely, ""Thank you, Dad. I'll go get some rest.""

Her gentle demeanor and compliance seemed to please Isaac. He sighed, feigning regret. ""Athena, you're a good girl. If my long-lost son didn't already have a girlfriend, I would've loved to see you as my daughter-in-law.""

Athena fought back the urge to thank him for sparing her from that fate. Remembering that Isaac hadn't been entirely unkind over the years, she offered a simple goodnight and made her way upstairs.

Isaac watched her go, a mixture of guilt and reluctance in his gaze. He was surprised by how obedient she remained, even as she was about to leave.

He hoped to wrap up this matter quickly so his real children could finally move in. With that thought, he put the papers away, turned off the lights, and headed upstairs.

In the master bedroom, Regina Kennedy paced nervously in her luxurious silk robe. When Isaac walked in, she immediately asked, ""So, what did Athena say?""

""She didn't make a fuss,"" Isaac replied, brushing it off. ""She turned down the house, said she'd ask for it if she ever needed it.""

Regina was taken aback. ""That old house might be a bit rundown, but it's still worth something. I think she just thinks it's beneath her. How greedy!""

Isaac frowned. ""I don't think Athena's like that.""

Regina shot him a sharp look. ""We're living in a villa worth over 60 million dollars. You think she's gonna settle for a house that's barely worth 200 grand?""

She then raised her hand, showing off her diamond ring. ""Do you know where I found this Vission diamond ring?""

""No,"" Isaac said with a sigh of relief. ""But thank God you found it. That would've been a hell of a loss.""

""Mia found it stuffed in Athena's clothes while packing,"" Regina said coldly. ""We always kept this ring locked up in our room. And guess who took it? Athena. That ungrateful little thief.""

""I bet she's just waiting for an excuse to squeeze more out of us in the future,"" Regina continued with a hard edge in her voice. ""We need to protect what's ours√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùfor our own kids. We can't give her another damn thing.""

# 4. Chapter 4

Isaac shook his head, disappointment clear in his eyes. ""Was all that obedient, considerate behavior just a damn act?""

""Absolutely,"" Regina scoffed, her expression twisted with disdain. The affection she once had for the girl she called her daughter had long since vanished.

She added, ""When Zoe was here two days ago, she couldn't stop admiring this diamond ring. I was planning to give it to her once she and Andrew got engaged. Who would've guessed Athena would swipe it right from under our noses?""

""Maybe you didn't know, but Zoe and Athena went to school together√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùfrom elementary all the way to high school. Zoe told me Athena was popular with the boys, and they used to shower her with expensive gifts. She never hesitated to accept them√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù""

""Let's not dig into this."" Isaac cut her off, unwilling to tarnish the memory of the girl they had once cherished.

""She's leaving soon. We raised her; we should just let it go,"" Isaac said, trying to push past the bitterness.

""I'm warning you,"" Regina said sternly. ""Don't give her a damn cent. Poor people are like bottomless pits. The moment they get a taste of easy money, they'll keep coming back for more. We can't let that happen.""

Isaac nodded. ""Don't worry. I'll keep it cordial, but she won't see a dime from me.""

As the couple schemed to keep Athena away, she stood in her almost empty room, staring at her packed luggage, nearly laughing.

Five suitcases were stacked by the door√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùtwo filled with clothes, one with shoes, another with bags, and the last one with skincare products and jewelry, none of it worth more than five figures. All the really expensive stuff was gone, but she didn't care.

She grabbed a few clothes and her tablet, packing them into a smaller bag. Scribbling a note, she read it aloud to herself, ""I'm gone. Don't worry, and don't miss me!"" She placed the note on her desk and quietly slipped out of the room.

Athena left behind everything the Kennedy family had ever given her. As she made her way through the dark, empty living room, she placed her keys and house card on the cabinet by the door.

Without a second glance, she stepped outside and headed toward her modest black car√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe one she bought with her own money, not a penny from the Kennedys.

Once inside the car, Athena pulled out her phone and dialed a number. When the call connected, she said, ""As of now, cancel all contracts with the Kennedy Group.""

There was a moment of stunned silence before the phone erupted with excited cheers. ""Finally! You're done being their doormat!""

Athena chuckled softly. ""I'm sorry for the trouble I caused. But starting today, I'm officially out of that family. They're no longer our problem.""

# 5. Chapter 5

Laughter rang out on the other end of the line. ""Everyone's here! Come celebrate with us!""

The sound of laughter and cheers poured through the phone, flooding Athena's ears.

The noise grew louder. ""Hell yeah! Congrats on making the right call and cutting ties with the Kennedy Group! First thing tomorrow, I'll contact them and terminate all their partnerships with Vission Group.""

""Even if they come begging, we're not backing down,"" they added, their excitement clear.

Athena grimaced at the noise, rubbing her temples. ""I'm driving. Let's talk later,"" she said, putting the car in gear.

She had no idea that, across the street from the villa, an SUV was parked under the trees, lying in wait like a predator, silently watching her every move. It was Matthew.

Moments after she drove off, Matthew in the SUV issued a curt order. ""Follow that car. Keep out of sight.""

""Yes, sir,"" his secretary Louis Connor replied, smoothly tailing Athena's car from a safe distance, confident she wouldn't notice.

After a while, curiosity got the better of Louis. He glanced into the rearview mirror and asked, ""Mr. Graham, you came back home and flew all the way to Kitmore City. I remember your goal is to meet Isaac in person and check out how he snagged Vission Group's exclusive West End distribution rights.

""But as soon as that girl showed up, you switched your focus to her. Are you interested in her?""

Inwardly, he mused, 'If Mr. Graham ever showed interest in a woman√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùhell, whether she's eighteen or thirty-eight√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄùI'd be so damn grateful. I'd probably sing hallelujahs.'

Matthew stayed silent, arms crossed, eyes closed, completely unfazed by the question.

But Louis, persistent as ever, couldn't let it go. ""She used to be the Kennedy family's golden girl. Now, she's changed her name to Athena Donovan. Two weeks ago, she took the SAT; last week she found out she wasn't Isaac's biological daughter, and today, she's supposed to meet her real family.

""From what I've heard, she's well-behaved, educated, and pretty low-key. Other than being drop-dead gorgeous and a top student, there's nothing else that stands out. So, why the sudden interest?""

Matthew remained silent, only fueling Louis's curiosity.

He said, ""I don't mean to be nosy, but the Kennedy Group's exclusive distribution deal with Vission Group is about to expire.

""If we don't lock it down now, we'll have to wait another three years. And we can't delay Lucy's treatment any longer. We need to find Dr. Annie through the Kennedys.""

Finally, Matthew spoke, his voice cold. ""You've been with me for years, and you still don't see what makes her different?""

Louis blinked in surprise, taking a moment to realize Matthew was talking about Athena. He replayed her actions in his mind, trying to figure out what might make her stand out. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't pinpoint anything and had to admit defeat.

""Besides her looks, I don't see anything special. Please, enlighten me,"" Louis said, a hint of curiosity creeping into his voice.",1,1753467007.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

The man I was supposed to marry.

Groveling at my feet, tangled in his own damn pants as he fumbles to cover himself. His face is pale, his hair disheveled, his lips‚Äîthose same lips that whispered loving words into my ears‚Äîswollen from kissing someone else.

A woman‚Äîa stranger‚Äîlays half-naked on the bed behind him, the silk sheets tangled around her body as she scrambles away like a cornered animal. Her eyes dart to mine in wide-eyed panic before she clutches the blanket to her chest and bolts toward the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

Coward.

Dmitri stares up at me, panic laced in his voice. ""Elena‚Äîit's not what it looks like.""

A hollow laugh escapes me. Cold. Emotionless. Clearly the laugh of a woman who has lost everything.

I take a step closer, my heels clicking against the polished hardwood floor. I feel detached from my own body, as if I'm watching this play out from somewhere far, far away.

""Don't touch me.""

My voice is sharper than I intend, but the thought of his hands on me now makes my skin crawl.

His face twists, desperation seeping into his features. ""It was a mistake! I wasn‚Äôt thinking‚Äî""

I scoff, my arms folding tightly over my chest. ""Oh? Your dick just happened to slip into her?""

Dmitri flinches. ""Elena‚Äî""

""Shut up.""

My breath is ragged. My vision blurs, but I refuse to cry. I refuse to break down in front of him.

I should be screaming. I should be throwing things, clawing at him, making him bleed the way he's just made me bleed. But I can't. I'm too numb.

Too shattered.

A part of me‚Äîa stupid, naive, pathetic part‚Äîwants him to fight for me.

To drop to his knees. To beg. To convince me that this isn‚Äôt real, that this is just some nightmare I‚Äôll wake up from.

But I don't wake up.

I just stand there, breathing in the reality of it all.

""You said you loved me.""

Dmitri swallows hard. ""I do.""

My laugh is bitter. ""You have a funny way of showing it.""

Silence.

Maybe if this was the past me. Even the ‚Äòme‚Äô from yesterday, I would have screamed. I would have cursed him out. But now? I was already exhausted. Half my world had already shattered this morning.

So, instead, I inhale sharply and turn on my heel, my heart pounding against my ribs.

I need to leave.

Now.

""Elena, wait!"" Dmitri grabs my wrist, his grip desperate, but I rip myself free with such force that he stumbles back.

The love I had for him dies in that moment.

I don‚Äôt even look back as I walk away. Leaving our apartment. I walk in a daze, my mind completely lost to mourning my step-father, mourning the marriage life that I knew wouldn‚Äôt happen anymore.

My parent‚Äôs house is dark when I step inside.

The funeral was in the morning. It felt like a lifetime ago. And now, it‚Äôs night.

Everything feels different. Colder. Like the walls know what I‚Äôve seen tonight, know that I am no longer the same woman who left this house earlier.

I swallow the lump in my throat and walk deeper inside, my heels clicking against the wooden floor.

""Mom?"" I call softly.

She must be sleeping. I had left her resting in her bedroom when I went to see Dmitri. God, I wish I hadn‚Äôt gone.

I wipe at my eyes, barely aware of the way my body shakes. The exhaustion crashes into me like a freight train.

One step. Then another.

I reach the kitchen, my fingers gripping the doorframe, ready to head upstairs‚Äî

Then I see her.

A choked gasp rips from my throat.

My mother.

She‚Äôs on the floor.

""Mom?"" My voice trembles.

She doesn‚Äôt move.

The room spins. My breath catches. No. No, no, no.

I stumble forward, collapsing onto my knees beside her. My hands shake violently as I reach for her, pressing my fingers to her neck, checking for breath, for warmth, for anything‚Äî

She‚Äôs burning.

Her skin is clammy, her forehead damp. And there‚Äîlittle red splotches marring her arm.

Burns.

What happened?

""Mom!"" I shake her. Hard. ""Mom, wake up! Please!""

She doesn‚Äôt stir.

The air leaves my lungs.

No. No. NO.

Please, God. Not her. Not her too.

My pulse roars in my ears, drowning everything else out as I grab my phone, my fingers fumbling, my vision blurring.

My heart slams against my ribs.

My throat tightens.

Tears blind me.

But there‚Äôs no time to panic.

I dial.

The ringing feels endless.

Then‚Äî

‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

I swallow a sob.

""My mother‚Äîshe‚Äôs unconscious. Please. Please hurry.""

The operator starts talking, but I can barely hear.

I press my forehead to my mother‚Äôs, my body trembling.

‚ÄúStay with me,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúPlease, Mom. Stay with me.‚Äù

# Chapter 2

Elena‚Äôs POV:

The sterile white halls of the emergency ward felt like they were closing in on me, the scent of antiseptic and fear thick in the air.

My mother was wheeled in on a gurney, nurses shouting to each other in rushed, clipped voices as the emergency room doors swung open, then slammed shut, sealing her away from me.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my pulse a frantic drum against my ribs.

What do I do? What do I do?

My hands trembled as I pressed them to my face, trying to steady my breath, but it was impossible. She was fine this morning. Weak, but alive. And now she was in there, fighting for her life.

A nurse approached, her expression gentle. ""Miss Kovalyova?""

I turned, my throat too tight to respond.

""The doctor will speak with you shortly.""

I nodded numbly, my nails digging into my palms.

Minutes stretched into eternity. I had no idea how long I stood there, my body tense and aching.

Then the doors swung open again, and a doctor stepped out, his face strained.

I rushed forward. ‚ÄúIs she okay?‚Äù

The doctor exhaled. ""Your mother suffered a severe cardiac episode due to prolonged stress and underlying conditions. We need to perform an emergency bypass surgery to prevent further damage.""

My breath caught. ""Okay,"" I said, too quickly. ""Then do it.""

His face hardened. ""The procedure costs fifty eight thousand dollars here.""

The number hit me like a punch to the gut.

A sharp ringing filled my ears as my mind tried to process it. Fifty thousand dollars?!

I didn't have that kind of money.

Hell, I barely had enough to cover next month‚Äôs rent. We were already in deep shit with our previous debt.

""You'll need to secure the payment within the next twenty-four hours so we can proceed,"" the doctor continued, oblivious to the way my world was crumbling beneath my feet.

""Twenty-four hours?"" My voice came out hollow.

""Yes. If we delay any longer, her condition may worsen beyond what surgery can fix.""

I stared at him. Twenty-four hours. Fifty eight thousand dollars.

""Do you have insurance?"" the doctor asked, his voice impassive, like this was just another conversation for him.

""No."" My voice broke on the word.

""Family who can assist?""

I wanted to laugh. What family?

He sighed, pushing his glasses up his nose. ""I suggest you find a solution quickly. We will keep her stable for now, but time is of the essence."" With that, he nodded and disappeared down the hallway, leaving me standing in the wreckage of my life.

I stumbled backward onto one of the plastic chairs in the waiting area, my vision swimming.

I was alone.

There was no one I could call, no one I could ask.

And for one horrifying second, my mind drifted to Dmitri.

Dmitri Vetrov. My ex-fianc√©.

Rich. Powerful. The youngest son of a multimillionaire. He could write a check for fifty thousand dollars without blinking.

Would he help me?

My stomach curled in disgust at the thought.

I could see it now. His smug, self-satisfied smirk. The condescending tilt of his head as he crossed his arms and leaned back, acting as if I owed him something for his generosity after how I had left him begging on his knees just a while ago.

No.

If my mother found out I had lowered myself to begging my cheating ex for money, she wouldn‚Äôt accept it. She would rather die than have me throw away my dignity for her.

And I wasn‚Äôt sure I could survive begging Dmitri either.

Then who?

My nails dug into my knees, my breath coming in short gasps. What do I do? What do I do?

And then‚Äî

A familiar name echoed from a nearby television.

I lifted my head.

The hospital‚Äôs mounted TV was tuned into a business channel, the news anchor‚Äôs voice crisp and professional.

‚Äú‚ÄîVetrov Enterprises, owned by billionaire Nikolai Vetrov, announced a record-breaking deal today‚Äî‚Äù

Nikolai Vetrov.

The camera shifted to a man in his mid-thirties, dressed in a sharp black suit, his jawline like it was carved from stone. His dark brown hair gelled back to perfection.

His cold, calculating dark eyes scanned the reporters, his smile hiding something dangerous.

The most eligible bachelor in the whole of Alderidge.

Nikolai Vetrov.

Dmitri‚Äôs older stepbrother.

And the man who hated Dmitri with every fiber of his being.

The memory surfaced before I could stop it.

Dmitri‚Äôs twenty-fifth birthday. Six months ago.

A lavish party was held in a massive ballroom, filled with people who definitely didn‚Äôt belong in my world. I was from a lower class family, attending college with a scholarship.

However, I had become Dmitri‚Äôs girlfriend and after four years, for the first time he had invited me to such an occasion. Introducing me to others like I was a trophy. I had actually been extremely happy that day.

Because that was also the day Dmitri had proposed to me.

I had just left the restroom, smoothing out my dress, when I nearly collided with Nikolai Vetrov.

He had been leaning against the hallway wall, one hand in his pocket, a cigarette between his fingers. His onyx brown eyes swept over me, slow and deliberate.

Then he exhaled, releasing a cloud of smoke. ""My condolences.""

I frowned. ""Excuse me?""

""Your mind is sharp,"" he murmured, voice low, slightly slurred from alcohol. ""But your taste in men is absolutely tragic.""

I had been dumbfounded.

Like, who says that about their own brother?

It was the first time I truly realized Nikolai didn‚Äôt just dislike Dmitri like a lot of siblings do. He despised him.

""You have such a smart little mind,"" he mused, ""but it‚Äôs wasted on a man like him.""

I scoffed. ""And what makes you say that?""

Nikolai took another drag from his cigarette, exhaling slowly as he looked out into the city through the massive floor to ceiling windows in front of us.

""He isn‚Äôt exactly husband material.""

I let out a sharp laugh. ""Oh? And what do you think makes a man husband material?"" It had truly been funny to me, that a ‚Äòman‚Äô was telling me what ‚Äòhusband material‚Äô was supposed to be.

But I didn‚Äôt defend Dmitri, I noticed the venom in Nikolai‚Äôs tone and knew it would be useless. I didn‚Äôt want to pick a fight with someone like him either.

His gaze darkened, piercing straight into my soul.

""He sucks at cooking.""

My brows lifted. ""Seriously?""

""You laugh, but a man who can‚Äôt even take care of himself can‚Äôt take care of you either.""

I rolled my eyes. ""It‚Äôs fine. I can cook and I‚Äôm used to taking care of myself.""

Nikolai‚Äôs lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk.

""He‚Äôs shit with money. Spends it like water.""

""He‚Äôs rich. Why does it matter?""

His gaze sharpened. ""Are you marrying him for money, then?""

I met his stare and tilted my head. ""What if I am?"" Of course I wasn‚Äôt. I hadn‚Äôt taken a dime from Dmitri. Not that I was against being treated like a princess. I was just not used to being indebted to anyone like this, it made my skin itch.

However, instead of getting offended, Nikolai looked‚Ä¶ satisfied. He straightened, flicking ash from his cigarette.

""Good,"" he said.

I frowned. That‚Äôs it?

He studied me for a long moment, then murmured, ""I‚Äôm richer than him, you know.""

I blinked.

""What does that have to do with me?""

Nikolai shrugged. Then he walked away.

Only later on had I realized what he meant when he had said the last line, but I had tossed it to the back of my mind and assumed he was testing me for his little brother.

That memory burned in my mind as I stared at his face on the TV screen.

Nikolai Vetrov was richer than Dmitri.

More powerful. More ruthless. And he hated his stepbrother.

I sucked in a sharp breath.

An idea began to take shape‚Äîinsane, desperate, but my only option.

I needed money.

I wanted power.

And there was a man who had both.

I needed Nikolai Vetrov.

# Chapter 3

Elena‚Äôs POV:

If I was wrong about Nikolai Vetrov‚Äôs intentions, the worst that could happen was that I would embarrass myself. That was nothing compared to what was at stake. But if I didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äîif I didn‚Äôt at least try to ask for his help‚Äîand my mother‚Äôs condition worsened, or worse‚Ä¶

I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life.

I exhaled sharply, forcing my shaky legs to push me upright.

That‚Äôs it then.

I had made my choice.

Pulling out my phone, I searched for the address of Vetrov Enterprises. I had been there once or twice before, back when Dmitri would take me out for lunch at one of the high-end restaurants near his brother‚Äôs office. But I didn‚Äôt remember the exact address.

At least I knew Nikolai wasn‚Äôt out of the country.

I glanced down at my outfit‚Äîa simple black dress, the same one I had worn earlier at my dad‚Äôs funeral. My hair was still tied into a low bun, strands falling loose from hours of exhaustion.

I looked like a grieving woman.

Which, in many ways, I was.

I was mourning the death of my father, the life I thought I would have, the man I thought loved me and the security I had believed in.

Now, I had nothing.

Except for this one insane, desperate plan.

‚Äî 30 minutes later ‚Äî

The towering glass building of Vetrov Enterprises loomed before me, its sharp edges piercing the dawn sky.

The city was still asleep, the streets nearly deserted, but this place‚Äîthis empire Nikolai built with his own hands‚Äîwas already awake at four o'clock in the morning.

A few luxury cars lined the private parking area, their sleek exteriors gleaming under the streetlights.

I inhaled deeply, steeling myself.

I knew I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to see him right away. CEOs don‚Äôt stroll into work at four in the morning. But I had no choice. I would leave my number with the receptionist and pray that Nikolai would agree to meet me.

There was no way I could ask Dmitri for his brother‚Äôs number.

Not when I was about to do this.

I pushed through the heavy glass doors and stepped into the lobby.

The receptionist at the front desk‚Äîa well-dressed woman in her late twenties‚Äî looked up from her computer screen, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me.

‚ÄúAre you Miss Elena?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúYou know me?‚Äù

She hesitated, then nodded. ‚ÄúAh, yes. Sir told me to send you up.‚Äù

My heart stopped.

What?

I stared at her, my pulse hammering in my ears. Had he‚Ä¶ anticipated my arrival?

No. That wasn‚Äôt possible.

How would he know?

My hands curled into fists, my heartbeat racing.

The receptionist smiled and handed me a key card. ‚ÄúTake the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor. He‚Äôs expecting you.‚Äù

I nodded slowly, forcing myself to act normal as I took the card and walked toward the elevator.

My mind was spiraling.

Was this just a coincidence? Had he expected me to come?

Or‚Ä¶ had he known all along that this day would come? No‚Ä¶that didn‚Äôt make sense. How would he know that I needed money for my mother‚Äôs bypass in advance?

There was another more plausible reason that swirled in my mind‚Ä¶was he somehow stalking me?

I swallowed hard, shaking off the thought as I stepped into the empty elevator.

That was ridiculous though. Why would someone like him have a need to do that?

The moment the doors slid shut, I let out a shaky breath and pressed my back against the cold metal wall.

Calm down. Keep it together.

I tapped the key card against the panel. The elevator hummed to life, carrying me higher and higher.

Maybe it was just my imagination or nervousness but the air felt thinner the closer I got.

Twenty-fifth floor.

Twenty-sixth.

Twenty-seventh.

A soft chime echoed, and the doors glided open.

There was only one office here.

A massive, double-door entrance at the end of the dimly lit hallway.

And sitting just outside it, a man‚Äîhis posture straight as he typed away at his laptop. Nikolai‚Äôs secretary?

As soon as he saw me, he stood up and gestured toward the doors.

‚ÄúSir is waiting for you, Miss Kovalyova.‚Äù He smiled and moved to open the door for me.

I nodded, thanking him as I stepped inside, my gaze immediately landing on the man behind the desk.

Nikolai Vetrov sat in his massive leather chair, flipping through a file as if he hadn‚Äôt just called me here before I even made the decision to come.

His dark eyes flicked up from his papers, locking onto me.

The man was unfairly attractive.

He looked unbothered, composed. His expensive suit was perfectly fitted, the top button of his shirt undone, revealing a glimpse of tattoos peeking from his collar.

The picture-perfect CEO.

And I was standing frozen in front of him.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he said smoothly, his voice deep.

The last time we had talked, I had drank alcohol so it hadn‚Äôt felt like this, and before that, the couple of times we ran into each other we hadn‚Äôt conversed at all.

I took a breath, forcing down my nerves. ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave a seat.‚Äù

I did, trying to keep my posture straight and confident despite the storm raging inside me.

‚ÄúTea or coffee?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNeither. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

Nikolai frowned slightly before picking up the telecom. ‚ÄúSend in a pumpkin spice latte.‚Äù

My body went rigid.

How‚Ä¶ did he know my favorite drink?

He leaned back, watching me with something close to amusement. ""Don't think too much. Dmitri talks a lot about you.""

My stomach tightened.

Hearing my ex-fianc√©‚Äôs name out loud felt like a punch to the ribs. But I refused to show it.

Instead, I kept my gaze trained on Nikolai. ‚ÄúYou know what he did, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

He smirked.

""I warned you, didn't I? He isn't husband material.""

I clenched my fists ignoring his remark for now. ‚ÄúWhy do you hate Dmitri?‚Äù

His smirk didn‚Äôt fade. ""Hate? No, I don't hate him. But I dislike him.""

I narrowed my eyes.

""He's spoiled. Daddy‚Äôs little treasure. He‚Äôs never suffered a day in his life. Never had to fight for anything. He thinks with his head, but not the one on his shoulders.""

Nikolai motioned toward his crotch.

I bit down on my tongue, feeling the urge to refute him.

But could I?

I had seen it with my own two eyes.

Dmitri was exactly what Nikolai described.

""After all,"" Nikolai continued, ""if he had any brains, he wouldn‚Äôt have fumbled someone like you.""

A sharp, hot sensation crawled up my spine.

This was it. This was my opening.

I lifted my chin. ""I have an offer for you.""

His eyes flickered with interest.

""Marry me. Give me enough money to save my mother. In return, I‚Äôll give you a wife on paper. And a way to make your little brother a laughing stock.""

For the first time, Nikolai froze.

I watched as he leaned back, studying me. Then, his lips curled.

""You're pretty straightforward. I expected you to take more time to come around.""

My fingers dug into my lap. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for that. My mother needs emergency Bypass surgery. Are you willing to help me or not?‚Äù

I was probably glaring at him now.

A moment of silence stretched between us.

Then‚Äî

""If I say no‚Ä¶ will you go back and ask Dmitri for money?""

A wry smile spread across my face.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt the only member of the Vetrov family I can go to, you know,‚Äù I said, my voice laced with something dangerous. ‚ÄúAfter all, I know Daddy Vetrov has certain tendencies toward girls half his age.‚Äù

I was pushing my limits.

But I had a hunch.

A dangerous, reckless hunch.

That Nikolai Vetrov was interested in me.

# Chapter 4

Elena‚Äôs POV:

As expected, Nikolai Vetrov went rigid.

His sharp, composed expression didn‚Äôt falter, but something in his posture shifted. His dark eyes locked onto mine, piercing, calculating‚Äîassessing me.

Then, he stood up. Slowly.

‚ÄúYou really are something, you know that?‚Äù His voice was smooth, almost amused, but there was an underlying challenge in his tone.

‚ÄúFine then.‚Äù He leaned against his desk, arms crossed. ‚ÄúBut tell me, Elena‚Äîwhat else are you willing to give? Because making Dmitri a laughingstock? That‚Äôs not difficult for me.‚Äù

He smirked. ‚ÄúI could do that without marrying you.‚Äù

He was right. He truly didn‚Äôt need me for that.

Like‚Ä¶there are rugs, everywhere. She has a closet full of them that she rotates. The home has PVC planks made to look like hardwood flooring and she has two dogs - one of which likes to victimize the dining room rug, if you know what I mean.

My mother has had ten surgeries on her back and hips; suffice it to say everything from bra strap to knees is some version of metal, or being held on by it. She also has osteoperosis that is mitigated by medication but has resulted in broken bones. She has fallen before.

My father is in his early eighties. He is mobile and extremely healthy, and I do not worry about him as much when it comes to mobility, but with his age, I am concerned.

Yesterday, my mother slipped and tweaked her hip something fierce on the dining room rug, a rug that when she purchased and laid down was already too slippery for the floor. I (43F) told her that this rug was dangerous and needs to either go out on the deck (she wanted an easily cleanable rug because of the dogs) or it gets returned to the store. No, she doubled down, put rug grippers on and as I told her, they did not work and so she slipped and hurt herself. She is refusing medical care and has left the house though I believe with her medical history and the recent operation on that hip, she should be seen.

I am at my wits‚Äô end with the fucking rugs. Statistics show that the number one reason for falls in seniors is rugs, and this is not the first time that there has been a rug related incident where there has been a near-miss with falling or tripping.

WIBTA if I removed all rugs except the living room rug (weighed down by couches on corners and coffee table in the middle), and the rugs (also secure) in the entrances, plus remove the rug collection so that they don‚Äôt make their way out? Both of them can drive and hold their own finances, but I am over the rugs and the danger they pose, and am willing to go behind her back and get doctor and sibling involved (though sibling lives in another state) to accomplish this.

tl;dr: Mother is mobility impaired. Insists on rugs. Seniors are prone to falls because of rugs, mother had a slip and near fall because of rug, is a fall risk, am I asshole for forcibly removing all rugs and getting sibling and doctor involved if need be?",2,1753466860.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,0,1.0,False

My best friend is getting married. Afterward, they‚Äôre going to Hawaii for their honeymoon. Hawaii, the place I‚Äôd dreamed of going to with my best friend. I‚Äôd saved up for years for that trip, but now it all seems pointless.Heartbroken and disappointed, I went to a club, where I danced like crazy, drank eagerly, and chatted with strangers. That night, I slept with a handsome stranger.For over twenty years, my eyes had only ever been on my best friend, Jake. I‚Äôd never cared about, dated, or even thought of being with anyone else.I quickly pushed down my shock and panic‚Äîat least until I saw him again at my best friend‚Äôs wedding. That mysterious, handsome man I‚Äôd spent the night with. I was stunned, but even more so when I realized who he was: my best friend‚Äôs older brother, Alex!I knew Jake had a brother, nine years older than us. Other than that, I knew nothing about him. But that night he told me his name was Xan!I quickly pulled him into a guest room, and the second I shut the door, I demanded, ‚ÄúYou lied to me!‚Äù pointing to his name.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Compared to my anger, he was completely calm, even holding a drink in his hand.

**Chapter 1 - Joey**

I know exactly when it happened. When my heart shattered into a million pieces. When my best friend, the man I was secretly in love with, got down on one knee in the middle of the restaurant, surrounded by our friends and proposed‚Äîto a woman he‚Äôd been seeing for only a couple months.‚ÄúI tell you, Joey.‚Äù Jake had mumbled three nights earlier, snuggled up on the couch, with me. ‚ÄúI think Phoebe might be the one.‚ÄùYeah? If she was the one, then where was she? Not there, with us, watching horror movies and eating trashy food, wrapped up under a blanket. Not falling asleep against Jake‚Äôs shoulder, being completely serene in his arms.So, if she wasn‚Äôt there, doing those things with him‚Ä¶ why did she get to wake up next to Jake? Why did she deserve the huge, almost 2-carat diamond ring his grandmother had given him? Why did she deserve to wear the beautiful ivory wedding dress, handed down through Jake‚Äôs family for the last seventy years?My lip had trembled as Phoebe, as fake as could be, had gushed and squealed, nodding as if her head was on a spring. Seeing Jake grin and stand, putting the ring on her finger; had made me realize I had never been an option for him.I‚Äôd had my heart set on being with Jake but obviously, I‚Äôd just taken too long in making my move and someone else had taken up the spot I had quietly and secretly reserved.I had been cordial to them; wishing them luck, telling Jake I was happy for him. I could see he didn‚Äôt believe me but didn‚Äôt say anything. I didn‚Äôt stay long after the proposal and the friendship between Jake and I pretty much died.The wedding was set for only a month later.A month. Way to absolutely destroy my heart.Jake had all but avoided me for the first three weeks, claiming Phoebe had him running around like a chicken with its head cut off, chasing wedding supplies he could only get from certain places.I googled it‚Ä¶ the stuff she was searching for, was cheap and could be bought on eBay for under a hundred dollars. I knew what she was up to. She had him running around, so he had less time with me, and I had less time to talk him out of it, because she knew I didn‚Äôt like her gold-digging rear.It was no secret Jake was a high-paid businessman and had properties which bought in a tidy sum every month. But none of that had ever interested me. I only wanted Jake, because I was in love with him and had been, since we‚Äôd been ten.Now, only a week out from the wedding, I was sitting here, staring at the ugliest dress in the world, while Jake sat on the sofa opposite, staring at the floor, and Phoebe stood over me, tapping her foot on the ground impatiently.‚ÄúObviously we‚Äôre going to have to get the straps reinforced to compensate for your larger‚Äî‚Äù I glared at Phoebe who in return frowned, biting her lip so she didn‚Äôt say anything snarky to me. ‚ÄúAnd it might be a good idea to watch what you eat for the next week. Maybe head to the gym? Sauna? You wouldn‚Äôt want something to happen to the dress and you pop a seam, because you‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúPhoebe, enough.‚ÄùI blinked as I looked over at Jake, seeing the flush to his cheeks. He didn‚Äôt look at me, as he ran his hand through his hair, hair which had been cut shorter. No doubt Phoebe‚Äôs doing, and it only accentuated Jake‚Äôs larger than average forehead. Something he‚Äôd always been conscious of.Phoebe stomped her foot a little, as her tone changed from the snappy one, she‚Äôd just been speaking to me in, to a whine. ‚ÄúWhat Jakey? I told you; she just doesn‚Äôt fit into the bridal party. She is not the right size, or coloring. She‚Äôs too pale and to‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúPhoebe, Jolene is my best friend, she will be in the main party, or there will be no wedding.‚Äù A glimmer of hope sparked in me, this might be the fight they needed, for Jake to realize he was making a mistake. Jake looked up at Phoebe, not even glancing in my direction. ‚ÄúBut if you like, at the reception, we can sit her at the table with your aunt? Instead of up with us.‚ÄùThat little glimmer went poof! with his words.I closed my eyes, as Phoebe sighed. ‚ÄúOkay, I guess I can deal with that.‚ÄùI put the lid on the box on my lap and slid it to the seat next to me and folded my hands in my lap, as Jake stood and hugged his fianc√©e, who giggled. I hated it when they kissed and hugged in front of me, it made me only more aware of the inadequacies I had as a partner for Jake and Phoebe loved to rub it in too. Giving me sideways glares as she kissed the man I had set my heart on.‚ÄúThen that‚Äôs settled.‚Äù I looked up at Jake, who had his arm around Phoebe‚Äôs shoulders, grinning from ear to ear, as Phoebe melded against him. Just another blatant show he was off limits. ‚ÄúJoey, we‚Äôll keep the dress with us, until Saturday. You‚Äôre going to look great in it.‚ÄùPhoebe scooped up the dress, as if it was a baby and flicked her hair, looking at Jake. ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôll go wait in the car. Don‚Äôt take too long. We have that dinner reservation at eight.‚ÄùJake nodded, kissing Phoebe again and as she turned to my front door, she glared at me.All I wanted, was to jump to my feet, crash tackle the person and break something squishy.Preferably her nose.Let‚Äôs see her be the beautiful bride then‚Ä¶‚ÄúJoey.‚Äù I turned my head, looking at Jake, as he crouched in front of me. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚ÄùNo‚Ä¶ no I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm in love‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt voice my emotions to Jake, instead I lowered my gaze from his and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, just tired. I‚Äôve been doing back-to-back shifts at the hospital, to get time off for my vacation.‚ÄùThe moment Jake and Phoebe announced their wedding would only be a month after their engagement, I had booked a week off, to go to Hawaii. I‚Äôd always wanted to go and had one day hoped to go with Jake. I‚Äôd been squirreling money away for it since I had started working at the hospital. I had enough for me to go for a week. So that‚Äôs where I was going, in the hopes of forgetting what had happened.‚ÄúOh, you got time booked off?‚Äù‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm going to go and spend a week in Hawaii.‚Äù I grinned and Jake‚Äôs face reddened.‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ well, we might see you there.‚ÄùI blinked and the smile fell from my lips. ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?‚ÄùHis face reddened further, and he turned his head away. ‚ÄúPhoebe has always wanted to go to Hawaii‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúWell, enjoy.‚Äù I spat, sinking back into the sofa, folding my arms over my body. ‚ÄúNow, you better go, before she starts beeping the horn like an impatient dog.‚ÄùJake‚Äôs gaze snapped to mine, and I caught the first glimpse of anger aimed at me in the thirteen years we‚Äôd been friends. It left quickly and he stood, leaving my tiny bungalow, slamming the door behind him.‚ÄúOh my gosh.‚Äù I lifted my hands and buried my face in them, trying to hold off the sobbing, until I heard Jake‚Äôs car leave. The sound of the vehicle pulling out of my driveway had my stomach dropping to the floor and I cried until my body hurt.Of all the places they had to pick for a honeymoon, it had to be Hawaii.My dream destination.I‚Äôd only ever dreamed of going there and now I could afford to; the experience was about to be ruined, because they would be there too.Reaching to the side, I picked up my phone and bought up the airline‚Äôs number. Dialing it, I waited for it to connect. Once the woman had said hello to her, I bunkered down for what I knew would be a marathon in trying to get my money back.

**Chapter 2** \- AlexOf all the people I knew, who I thought would get married‚Ä¶, my little brother Jake, was at the bottom of the list. The whiny, self-absorbed little twat was under do not answer on my contact list and the last time I‚Äôd spoken to him, I walked away with blood on my [hands.Now](http://hands.Now), staring at the gaudy wedding invitation sitting on my desk, I wondered if he‚Äôd sent it, or if this was what my mom had been talking about when she said she wanted us to talk again.I glanced again at the name scrawled in fancy lettering alongside my brother‚Äôs.‚ÄúPhoebe Fitzgerald?‚ÄùWhy did that name sound so familiar?I leaned back in my chair, wracking my brain. Phoebe‚Ä¶Phoebe‚Ä¶‚ÄúNo way‚Ä¶‚Äù Leaning forward, I opened my laptop and opened Facebook, scrolling through my brother‚Äôs friends list until I found her. ‚ÄúWhat the hell. Phoebe Fitzgerald‚Ä¶ Fee Fee. The woman of the school. Well, I hope you know what you‚Äôre doing, little bro, because that girl is nasty‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúWho‚Äôs nasty?‚ÄùStanding six-foot-three with change, and taking up most of the doorway, was my right-hand man and best friend, Oliver. ‚ÄúYou remember Fee Fee?‚Äù‚ÄúPhoebe Fitzgerald? The one you didn‚Äôt want to go anywhere near. Fee Fee Forget it if you want to keep your pecker clean? Didn't she get along well with half the football team?""‚ÄúYep, that one.‚Äù I chuckled, putting down the lid of my laptop. I picked up the invitation and held it out to the big man. ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre about to become related.‚Äù‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding me.‚Äù Oliver crossed the room and plucked the invitation out of my hand, peering at it. ‚ÄúWell, I can't believe it. Little boy bastard is getting hitched, and to someone older than him too‚Ä¶ Good luck there, buddy.‚ÄùOliver and Jake had never really gotten along. Not since Jake had slept with Oliver‚Äôs kid sister, after prom in high school and broken her heart. He had a string of broken girls tagging behind him and my mind suddenly went to Joey. ‚ÄúOh my gosh‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Ollie asked, tossing the invite back to the desk.‚ÄúJoey.‚Äù‚ÄúJake's best friend?""I nodded. I could only imagine what the wedding would be doing to her brain. She‚Äôd always been in love with Jake. Everyone could see it‚Ä¶ bar him. Now, with Jake marrying someone else, Joey would be heartbroken to say the least.She had never been Jake‚Äôs type‚Ä¶ hell, I didn‚Äôt even think she‚Äôd be anyone‚Äôs type.Chubby would have been a nice word to use. The kid‚Äîand I hadn‚Äôt seen her since she was thirteen‚Äî had been almost seventy pounds heavier than she should have been and sported the worst acne I had ever seen on someone in my life. Coupled with braces and brown hair, she was not a popular kid.‚ÄúYou think she‚Äôll be, okay?‚ÄùI shrugged, leaning back in my chair. ""Doubt it, but what can I do? She's Jake's best friend, and I am in his eyes, public enemy number one. So, I can't do it."" Letting my anger wash over me, I finally opened my eyes and looked at Ollie.He was peering at me, jaw twitching. It made a vein at the side of his head pulse, and I raised an eyebrow at the kid I‚Äôd grown up with, the man who had gone with me, when I‚Äôd left Miami. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù‚ÄúTo that person‚Äôs wedding. You‚Äôre going, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù My gaze moved to the wall behind Ollie, and he sighed. ‚ÄúFor god‚Äôs sake. You know that is the stupidest idea in the world, right? You broke his nose, last time you saw him.‚Äù‚ÄúThat was ten years ago, Oliver.‚Äù‚ÄúTime doesn‚Äôt heal all wounds, Alexander.‚Äù Ollie spat back, crossing his eyes as he said my name. ‚ÄúI know even if I was invited, which I ain‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt go, because of what he did to my sister. You shouldn‚Äôt be going, because of what happened with Joey.‚ÄùThe man in front of me was turning an interesting shade of red and I had to calm him down, before he had a heart attack and his wife, Jade, came after me. ‚ÄúRelax, Ollie, I‚Äôm not going there to make up with him. I am going there to see my parents.‚ÄùOliver raised an eyebrow.‚ÄúSo, when is it again?‚Äù Ollie picked up the invitation and frowned. ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶ next weekend. So, I take it our fishing trip is out of the question.‚Äù‚ÄúIs that the same weekend?‚Äù I grinned and Ollie flicked the invitation at me, hitting me in the body with it.‚ÄúYou right know it is, wanker. We‚Äôve been planning it for months. I finally got away from Jade and the baby for two days, and you‚Äôre going to flake on me to attend the wedding of the brother you can‚Äôt stand.‚Äù‚ÄúI told you; I‚Äôm doing this for the olds. I haven‚Äôt seen them in almost three years.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd whose fault is that? Huh? You‚Äôre so snowed under with these business proposals and keeping up the tough guy image in the clan, you haven‚Äôt had time to think of the people who are the most important to you. Your parents.‚Äù‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fine.‚Äù I muttered, knowing Ollie had a point. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been sending them money.‚Äù‚ÄúUh huh‚Ä¶ money that‚Äôs probably paying for that little brat‚Äôs big day.‚ÄùI had thought of that.If Mom and Dad didn‚Äôt need money, most of it would have been funneled into Jake‚Äôs pockets, as an allowance. But I had done what any respecting oldest child had done and made sure his parents were taken care of.‚ÄúDoes Yuka know you‚Äôre going?‚ÄùMy mind snapped back to the room I was sitting in, and I frowned, lifting my gaze to the picture on the wall, above the small bar in my office.Yuka Takada had been like a father to me. He‚Äôd taken Ollie and I in, when we‚Äôd left Miami. Giving us a chance in his business to earn some good coin, and a reputation which followed us, no matter where we went. We moved all the way to New York to work for him and he‚Äôd been nothing but supportive. ‚ÄúNo, I wasn‚Äôt going to tell him, until I got back.‚Äù‚ÄúThink that‚Äôs wise? You‚Äôll be in Yamota‚Äôs territory, and you know you need permission to be there. If one of his clan saw you, the next time we saw you, you‚Äôd be in a body bag.‚Äù Oliver grimaced, as he leaned back in the chair., ‚ÄúLook, I love you man. Like a brother. But‚Ä¶ If Yuka found out you went there without permission, even if it‚Äôs for your kid brother‚Äôs wedding, even I couldn‚Äôt keep you safe from him; and I‚Äôm his son-in-law. And that‚Äôs if you made it out of Miami alive‚Ä¶‚ÄùOliver had a point. Even with his marriage to Yuka‚Äôs only daughter, Jade, he‚Äôd never have a say about what would happen to me. If Yuka found out I went against clan protocol and entered a territory which we didn‚Äôt control, without his permission‚Ä¶ I shuddered with the thought.‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll clear it with him.‚Äù‚ÄúThe sooner the better. He needs a chance to ring Yamoto and let him know what‚Äôs going to happen. That it‚Äôs not a takeover attempt, or a scouting mission. That you‚Äôre just there for that little brat‚Äôs big day and then you‚Äôll high tail it back to New York.‚ÄùI nodded and Ollie stood, adjusting the jacket which hid his huge frame. ‚ÄúAre you coming to the club tonight?‚Äù‚ÄúNah, not tonight.‚Äù I leaned back, watching Ollie fidget with the watch on his wrist, something he did, when he was stressed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ring Yuka and see if he‚Äôs free for a meeting.‚Äù‚ÄúThis late at night?‚Äù Ollie looked down at his watch. ‚ÄúYou might be lucky. Mama Takada will have headed to her Mahjong game. Yuka should be in his office for at least another hour. But you should already know that.‚Äù‚ÄúThanks, man.‚ÄùOllie nodded and left my office, closing the door behind him as he did. I picked up the invitation off my lap, where it had fallen and dropped it back to the desk. I would need at least four days' leave.Because of clan meetings and setting up security for while I was gone, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get to Miami until Thursday. The wedding was Saturday, and I would have to be back on a plane Sunday morning, because of time-sensitive meetings on Monday. ‚ÄúWhat the hell.‚ÄùSighing, I reached out and picked up the office phone and dialed 1, before leaning back in the chair and waited for my boss to answer.

**Chapter 3** \- JoeyIt'd taken me almost an hour to get through to a person to get a refund. Then another hour of trying to convince them I couldn't make it to Hawaii. I had to incur late cancelation charges, but in the end, I had managed to get my money back.Now, I sat on the sofa of my tiny apartment, on the verge of tears.I had cried so much in the last couple months, I knew if I kept trying to, eventually I'd cry blood.Jake and I had known each other since we were kids. Almost fifteen years. I'd been by his side the whole time, and he'd been my rock. He'd protected me and made my schooling life easier, and for him to just move on like he had... I just struggled to understand what I had done wrong.My phone buzzed across the coffee table, and I leaned forward, picking it up, smiling at the happy face flashing on the screen.Holding the device to my ear, I held back tears. ""Hey, papa bear.""""Hey, there's my Roo.""Roo... it had been my father's nickname for me since I was five and had seen a kangaroo at a zoo and refused to move around the world without jumping like one for weeks. ""Where are you?""""Cyprus."" My father had decided after my mom had passed a few years ago, to travel. He was still reasonably young, and I was happy for him. But at moments like this, I missed him. ""I've sent you another package.""""Papa, you don't have to keep sending me things.""""Yes, I do. I want to make you happy. Especially at the moment."" there was a pause. Dad had been furious when he found out Jake was marrying someone else. He'd all but expected Jake and I to get together, since we'd been friends for so long. ""How are you doing?""""Terrible. I just had to cancel my trip to Hawaii.""""What? Why?"" Dad asked. ""You've been saving for that trip for years.""""Yeah, tell me about it. One guess on where they're going for their honeymoon... at the same time as me...""""Oh, Roo."" I could hear my dad's heart breaking all the way from the Mediterranean. ""That is unfair.""""Oh, and I got shown my bridesmaid dress today. It's pale, milky snot green.""""You know how hard it is for me not to get on a flight back and sock the pair of them? Seriously. That boy has rocks in his head. He always has.""I giggled and leaned back on the sofa. ""Yeah, he's not the brightest star in the sky.""""You'll find someone who is the brightest star, and he's going to outshine the dim light that boy is giving off.""I whole belly laughed this time. I gave my dad one thing; he knew how to make me laugh. ""Papa, jeez. I thought you liked Jake.""""I did. Until he broke my Roo's heart. Now if I see him, I'd probably run him over.""""Stop."" I cackled and sighed, wiping the tears from my eyes. ""One good thing I guess, at least I won't have to stress too much about impressing him anymore.""I'd been doing that for so long, I was actually scared about the thought of having a life without Jake. He'd been such a big part of my world, I was worried what my world was going to look like now, without him in it.""You're going to be fine, Jolene. You're strong, like your momma was. You're going to shine so bright; he's going to wonder why the hell he decided to go for someone like Phoebe.""""I'd like to hope so, Papa."" I leaned my head back on the sofa and stared at the glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. ""Enough talking about Jake, where are you off to next?""As my dad rambled about his adventures and where he was headed to in the next leg of his trip, I got up and pottered around the apartment, making sure my daily chores were done, before I headed to bed.""Anyway, I better let you go, Roo, it's getting late there, and I don't want to keep you up any longer.""""Ok Papa. I love you.""""Love you too. night Roo."" my dad hung up and I held the phone to my lips for a minute, before placing it on the coffee table. Turning away, I headed toward the bathroom, when it buzzed again.Sighing, I went back to it and picked it up.Jake's face was on the screen, and I frowned, tempted not to answer it. but in the end, I did. ""Hey, Jake.""""Hey, Thursday night, Phoebe and her friends are heading out for her hen's night. I managed to convince her to take you.""Oh eww... I didn't want to go out with Phoebe and her fake friends.""Really? I was hoping for a quiet night.""""Well, I want you to go. It'll be good for you guys to hang out and smooth things over."" There was not a single sliver of compassion in his voice. It was an ultimatum and I felt like telling him to shove it up his rear. But in the end, I sighed and closed my eyes, pinching the bridge of my nose.""Fine. What time?""""They will pick you up at seven.""""Uh huh.""""This is going to be good, Joey. You and Phoebe are going to become great friends. I'll chat to you later.""The phone clicked and I almost threw it across the room in anger.This was not going to be a good thing; this was going to be a disaster waiting to happen.And when it did happen, I hoped to hell it would kick Jake where it really hurt.

**Chapter 4** \- Alex‚ÄúAlexander, you are staying late tonight. I thought you would have left with Oliver to the club.""I pinched the bridge of my nose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to disturb you, Yuka-San. Is there a chance of coming to see you?‚Äù‚ÄúNow?‚Äù‚ÄúOnly if you have the time, sir.‚Äù‚ÄúOf course, Alex. Pearl is still in reception. I‚Äôll let her know you‚Äôre on your way.‚Äù‚ÄúThank you, sir, I will be prompt.‚Äù I placed the phone back in its cradle and stood, shutting down my laptop and locking it away in my drawer. While I knew no one in my office would be so bold to take it, there had been a string of break-ins in the district lately, targeting clan businesses. I didn‚Äôt want to take chances. Not when I was one of the heads of security of the Takada Clan. I‚Äôd pick it back up and take it home with me, on the way out.Picking up my jacket, I pulled it on, pocketing the invitation, while I walked out of my office and headed for the main elevator in the lobby.Stepping into the elevators, I pressed the button for the top floor and rode up.The doors slid open, and I stepped out into a larger, more opulent version of my own office.An older woman with a fierce scowl and a large string of pearls around her neck, stood only a few feet in front of me, hands wedged firmly on her hips, making me stop in my tracks. I blinked, then smiled my most charming smile, bowing. ‚ÄúHello, Pearl.‚ÄùYuka‚Äôs personal assistant of more than forty years narrowed her gaze at me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you hello Pearl me, young man. Why the hell are you still in this building? Why aren‚Äôt you at home, with a pretty wife and child? Oh, that‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre too stubborn, too pig-headed and too into clan business to have the time to find someone who will put up with you.‚Äù‚ÄúOh, ouch, Pearl.‚Äù I chuckled, clutching at my body. ‚ÄúYou wound me with your callousness. Besides, I‚Äôve told you, when you give me permission to take out your useless husband, then I will have the girl of my dreams.‚ÄùPearl rolled her eyes and shook her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always sickly sweet with your compliments to me, Alexander.‚Äù‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I winked, planting a quick kiss on her wrinkled cheek. ‚ÄúYuka said I would be by tonight?‚Äù‚ÄúYes. He did. And while you‚Äôre in there with him, you can both go over the new security reports.‚Äù Pearl turned back to her desk, waddling to it and I followed her. ‚ÄúI would have had them sent up to Suki in the morning, but when I heard, you were coming to see Yuka, I thought I‚Äôd just give them straight to you.‚Äù‚ÄúThank you, Pearl.‚Äù I took the folders from her and smiled. ‚ÄúYou have a good evening and let me know when you want your husband sorted.‚ÄùPearl‚Äôs face flushed red, and she giggled. ‚ÄúI think the sake is going to sort him out for me, Alexander.‚ÄùPearl gathered her handbag and coat, and I walked her to the elevators, bidding her farewell. When the doors had closed, I turned and wandered to the large gold door to the left of the reception desk and pushed through it. Traveling the long hallway, I stopped at the end and knocked on the red wood of Yuka‚Äôs office door.‚ÄúCome!‚ÄùPushing open the door, I stepped only two feet into the office, leaving enough room for the doors to close behind me and stopped, my gaze averted to the floor, as per clan protocol, hands rigid by my sides and bowed. ‚ÄúYuka-san.‚Äù‚ÄúAh, Alex, come, do sit down.‚ÄùI lifted my head and walked to the chair being offered and sat in it, placing the folder on my lap, and finally lifted my gaze to Yuka [Takada.By](http://Takada.By) all appearances, Yuka looked to be in his mid-late forties. With jet black hair and a complexion as smooth and supple of a man much younger than him. But the fine lines around his eyes and the wisdom in his gaze showed he was in fact pushing sixty-eight this year.‚ÄúNot quite as prompt as normal, Alex.‚Äù Yuka chuckled.I smiled. ‚ÄúSorry, sir. I was chatting to my future wife.‚ÄùYuka‚Äôs laughter reverberated around the room, a hearty chuckle which I was one of the only ones to have ever heard. ‚ÄúYou know, you would be in trouble if Pearl‚Äôs husband heard you speak to his wife, like you do.‚Äù‚ÄúIf he crawled out of the sake bottle long enough.‚Äù I replied, with a wry chuckle and Yuka nodded.‚ÄúVery true.‚Äù Yuka leaned back in his chair, hands sleeping in front of him. ‚ÄúNow what is so urgent that you must come to me at this time of night? When you could be at the club with my son-in-law.‚Äù‚ÄúYou know sir, I only leave the office, once you have, and you are here late tonight also, so here, is where I am.‚Äù It was a protocol I had implemented myself, after an attempt on Yuka‚Äôs life, when the last head of security had left for the night. I had been promoted the following day and the other clan member was cleaning toilets at Ollie‚Äôs club. ‚ÄúBut I do come to ask of a small favor.‚ÄùIgnoring the folders on my lap, I pulled the invitation from my pocket and offered it to him with both hands, bowing my head.Yuka took the invitation, looked at it and frowned. ‚ÄúAh, so the little brother you told me you do not like, has asked you to come home for his wedding.‚Äù‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd you want my permission?‚ÄùI lifted my head and looked at him. ‚ÄúIt is Yamota territory, and I know while we have a truce with them at the moment, it is fragile, and I do not want to upset it.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd with you being the head of my security, Yamota may see it as an incursion, or scouting mission.‚Äù Yuka stroked his chin, holding the invitation in one hand as he did.‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Yuka returned the invitation, and I pocketed it again. I watched him for a moment, before he leaned forward and picked up the phone. I lowered my gaze as he punched in a number and waited. ‚ÄúSana, it is Yuka Takada.‚ÄùI bit the inside of my cheek, in anticipation. This could go two ways.‚ÄúI have a small favor to ask.‚Äù I closed my eyes, hoping to hell that Yamota was in a good mood. I didn‚Äôt want to go to my brother‚Äôs wedding, but I did want to go home and see my parents. Even to do that, I would need permission not only from Yuka, but also the man on the other end of the line. ‚ÄúMy head of security is needing to come into your territory for‚Äî‚ÄùThere was a pause, and I lifted my head. Yuka raised an eyebrow, and I held up four fingers.‚ÄúFour days. His kid brother is getting married on Saturday and he is wanting to see family, while he is in Miami. He will be leaving to come back to New York on Sunday.‚ÄùYuka listened as Yamota responded and he nodded. ‚ÄúYes. Alexander Kazumi. That‚Äôs right.‚ÄùI grimaced.Yamota knew who I was. Well, being the head of security for the Takada clan would get your name out there.‚ÄúYes, I understand. Yes, and a bottle of Sake? Of course. Any brand in particular?‚Äù Yuka‚Äôs eyebrow rose. ‚ÄúHokusetsu daiginjo YK35 shizukuzake titanium gold?‚ÄùDouble trouble. That sake was almost sixteen hundred US dollars.‚ÄúThank you, Sana-San. I will.‚ÄùYuka put the phone back into its cradle and looked at me. I lowered my gaze, frowning. ‚ÄúTakada-San, it is too high of a price to‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúSh.‚Äù I closed my eyes. ‚ÄúIt is nothing, Alex. You know I value family above everything else, and since I have none of my own, I have come to see Oliver and you as sons.‚ÄùI lifted my head and looked at the man, who smiled and stood. ‚ÄúCome, let me show you something.‚ÄùI followed Yuka to a door on the left of his office and into another room. My stomach dropped to my feet as I stared at the walls lined with alcohol.Yuka moved to one side, picking up a bottle and turning to me. ‚ÄúI have three of these, just sitting here. I prefer Kikusui Daiginjo Shukondeinoshiro Kamutachi. I am just waiting on this year‚Äôs batch to be ready.‚ÄùHe handed me the heavy bottle and I looked down at it. The container which held the sake was made of pure titanium, with a slight pearlescent shimmer to it. I looked at Yuka and bowed. ‚ÄúYou honor me with this gift to give to Yamota.‚Äù‚ÄúPsh.‚Äù Yuka said, ushering me out of his personal cellar and back into the warmer office. ‚ÄúYamota owes me a favor anyway. This is just an add on to that. He knows that. This is just a peace offering, so you can attend your brother‚Äôs wedding.‚ÄùI nodded and returned to my seat, placing the bottle gently on the floor next to me and picked up the folders I‚Äôd placed on the desk, when I‚Äôd stood up.Yuka sat in his chair and looked at me. ‚ÄúBut you must go and deliver it to him in person, Alex. Which means your tattoos must be completely covered. Head to toe, carry your ID, but go in with no weapons. I do not want one of his underlings mistaking you for an insurgent. I‚Äôd like you to come back to New York in one piece.‚ÄùI nodded. I‚Äôd been into a rival clan‚Äôs territory unarmed before and I could tell you, it was one of the most terrifying things I‚Äôd done. To know you were surrounded by men who at any other time would be glad to put a bullet between your eyes, or a knife to your heart, was one of the most sobering things I‚Äôd ever done. ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù‚ÄúGood. Now, what are the folders in your hand?‚ÄùI smiled and opened them, and we delved into a more mundane clan agenda.

**Chapter 5** \- JoeyThe night was cold and the smell of the little back alley we were in, was making me nauseous; but here I was, standing in the cold, waiting, while Phoebe and her posse of copycat bridesmaids, squared up to the bouncer of the club, she was trying to get us into.‚ÄúDo you have any idea who I am?‚ÄùI rolled my eyes and put my hand to my face in embarrassment, as Phoebe stomped her foot, demanding the bouncer let us in. The line behind us was starting to back up and the patrons waiting to get into the club after us, were starting to get rowdy. I couldn't understand why she wanted to get into this one in particular. It didn't seem like such a hot spot. It looked dark and gritty and to be honest, dirty and dangerous. I never thought someone who seemed so posh, as Phoebe did, would want to go in there.I personally would have rather go to a restaurant and have a nice meal, before heading home and going to bed. But this seemed to be Phoebe's thing.Whatever. When we finally made it into the club, I would squish my larger frame into the smallest corner I could find, and probably hiss at anyone who tried to come near me. I did not like being put into situations I didn't want to be in.The huge bouncer stood fast, arms crossing over his body as he stared down at the woman in front of him. He had a couple more standing behind him, for backup if needed, but I didn't think he'd have too much trouble with Phoebe and her brat pack. ""I don't give a stuff who you are, you're not getting in, by skipping the queue. Go to the back of the line and wait, like everyone else.""I didn‚Äôt understand how Phoebe could think her tactics could work on someone who could fold her in half and stuff her into a trashcan.Sighing, I looked at the bouncer who was quickly losing his patience with the mouthy blonde in front of him. If she kept it up, she would be finding herself if not in a trash can, then at least in the gutter on her rear. Then I would have no choice but to take a photo and keep it for future moments of depression, when I would need a pick me up. I might even frame it and put it on the wall as my one consolation from this whole difficult chapter of my life.Phoebe‚Äôs friends finally managed to pull her away, much to her disgust and I stepped to the side, letting other patrons come to the door. The bouncer let them in, which only seemed to fuel Phoebe's indignation and her screeching could probably be heard from the other side of town.Who did she think she was? The Queen? I could only imagine what type of life my best friend was about to be married in to. The woman Jake was marrying was a narcissist. She wanted things her way, or there would be hell to pay. What kind of life was Jake going to have, with her by his side? She'd probably work him into the ground and then what? That was if they stayed married. She also seemed like the kind of woman to marry, stay for a few months, then run.I hoped my best friend had a good pre-nup.Why had I agreed to come to this? When Phoebe and her friends had turned up to pick me up, she had been on the phone with Jake, complaining about having to take me with them.On speaker phone...Jake had told her to give me a break, that it would be good for me, and I had almost beamed with pride at him standing up for me, until he had said that I had no other friends.That was a lie. I had‚ÄîMy mind drew a blank and I frowned.He was right.Well, Jolene Brewster. After this, you need to pull up your big-girl panties and make some new friends. You can‚Äôt rely on being around Jake anymore, especially now he was going to be married to the world‚Äôs biggest asshole woman. This was going to be the turning point in your life and you were going to make it on your own.I should have chucked on my big girl panties an hour ago and told her I wasn't going with them. That would have suited us all well. Phoebe could have told Jake I went, and we could have had the first civil interaction. I would have been able to stay at home and brood on the fact that my best friend was a rear.Sighing, I ignored the women who were still making a scene off to the side and turned back to the club. The neon signs were buzzing, and the sound of the music thumping from the club was starting to drill into my head. I really didn't want to go in there. My gaze moved to the bouncer, who smiled and winked at me, lifting the rope a little. I blinked and pointed to myself, and he nodded, tilting his head toward the club.He was going to let me in?I pointed back to Phoebe and her friends, and he shook his head, pointing at me, mouthing 'You only'.I looked back to Phoebe, who was now complaining loudly and threatening to call her father to come and deal with the bouncer and I knew, even though I didn't want to go into the club, if I didn't go in by myself, I would be doomed to have the crappiest night of my life and I would resent Jake and Phoebe even more than I did.Grinning, I nodded and scuttled toward the rope, ducking under the bouncer‚Äôs arm and just as the rope came down, I heard Phoebe screech break out into the night. ‚ÄúJolene! Where are you going? Hey! Let us in too! We‚Äôre with her!‚ÄùI ignored her, knowing I had scored a little win and almost danced my way into the club. This was going to be the best night of my life. I could feel it in my bones.

1m96ce1,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1m96ce1/10_work_from_home_apps_i_use_daily/,10 Work From Home Apps I Use Daily,"I've been working from home for more than 3 years now. I've tried a ton of different apps. I thought I'd share the list of tools I actually use every day:

1. PDFMaster. for Mac by this tech company called Cisdem: My mornings usually start with coffee and going through some important PDF my team sends. Client report, contract, whatever. God, I used to hate dealing with PDFs. Such a pain in the ass until I found this tool. It allows me to fix text right in the document or edit whatever I want without all that conversion nonsense. I use it for:
   * Fixing typos right in the PDF
   * Filling out those annoying forms
   * Converting stuff to Word when clients need edits
   * Making old scanned crap actually searchable
   * Blocking out personal info before sharing
   * Shrinking huge files so they don't bounce from email
   * Using the AI when I'm feeling lazy and need a summary
2. Slack: After dealing with the all the documents, I check Slack. All our team discussion and documentation happens here instead of sending multiple emails. I share my finding from those PDFs or check what's the update with ongoing projects. Just helps me get on the same page with everyone.
3. Notion: Once I am update about what's going on with the team, I switch to Notion. This is where I plan what I'm actually doing today. Got pages for everything - project stuff, random notes from calls, personal to-dos. I like that I can make it super simple some days and crazy detailed when projects get messy.
4. Google Drive: All my actual work files sit in Drive. As I check things off in Notion, I'm constantly digging through folders here. I've lost too many files over the years to trust my local storage. Plus I can grab anything from my phone when I'm not at my desk.
5. Loom: When I need to explain something but really don't want another Zoom call on my calendar, I use Loom. Just record my screen, talk through what I'm showing, send the link. Done. Especially useful for giving feedback on designs or walking through a bug I found. People watch when they have time, and I don't have to find 30 minutes where everyone's free.
6. Canva: I'm terrible at design. Like, genuinely bad. But sometimes I need to make something that doesn't look like complete trash. Canva saves me. Grab template, change words, switch colors, done. Takes me minutes to make something decent enough for internal presentations or reports.
7. Zapier: Zapier handles all the stupid repetitive stuff I hate doing. It just connects my apps and makes them do things automatically. Like when someone fills out our intake form, it creates the client folder, adds them to our email list, and notifies the team without me lifting a finger. I set it up once and forgot about it.
8. Toggl Track: To keep a track of how I'm spending my day, I use Toggl Track. Dead simple time tracker. At the end of the week, I can see exactly where my hours went. Really opened my eyes to how much time I waste on certain clients or projects. Makes it obvious when I need to raise rates or drop time-sucking work.
9. Obsidian: When I need to think through something complex, I open Obsidian. It's for taking notes that link together like your brain actually works. This is where the messy thinking happens - connecting ideas, saving research, working through problems. It's weird at first but now I can't go back to regular notes apps. Too limiting.
10. 1Password: I use 1Password to manage all my passwords. I'm terrible with passwords - used to use the same one everywhere. Now I only remember one master password and it handles the rest. Simple tool that's probably saved me from identity theft multiple times.

That's my setup. Each tool has its job, and together they keep my days from falling apart. Maybe some will work for you too.",1,1753466682.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

Java is a specific color variation within Horween‚Äôs waxed flesh lineup‚Äîa deep, rich brown reminiscent of coffee‚Äîused by Truman Boot Co. It falls under the broader ‚Äúbrown waxed flesh‚Äù category but stands out with its thicker wax coating and glossier sheen, especially under light. Parkhurst‚Äôs Brown Waxed Flesh, by contrast, has a more muted, matte finish and a subtler surface texture that reveals itself with wear.

While the base tannage comes from the same source, these two interpretations bring out very different characteristics. Truman‚Äôs build leans into the bold with a chunky cap toe and more aggressive silhouette, while Parkhurst keeps it classic with a plain toe stitchdown that feels clean and versatile. It‚Äôs a great example of how two brands can take the same leather and end up with boots that wear‚Äîand feel‚Äîcompletely different. Anyone else have both and notice the same thing?

1m968v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m968v7/a_seminal_event_that_happened_a_long_time_ago/,A seminal event that happened a long time ago,"Fair warning: there is a description of a fatal car accident here and apologies, this is a long one and I didn't re-read it.

18 years ago, I was in my early 20s and I worked for a company that did inventory at large box stores. The summer of 2007 we spent about 3 months traveling across a few provinces doing a 4 stores a week. There were 8 or so vans and each van always traveled together. Normally when we finished a store, each van would leave for the next location as the members of the van were done. Some people stayed a little longer, some left a little sooner. 

This particular day we were in a fairly small town, about 170 km down a secondary highway. The stores started early. The first people showed up around 6am and most everyone else around 7 or so. The store went well and the first vans started leaving around 4pm on a 3 and half hour drive to the next place. There were 4 or 5 vans left ahead and 3 or so still after us but after we grabbed some coffees we were on our way. 

The road out, as mentioned, was about 170km long and aside from a couple roads off of it, is pretty well barren with lots or small lakes and little to no cell reception. There are long gradual turns and small hills the road rises and falls through. At the halfway mark of the highway we came over a little hill to cars stopping in front of us. 4 or 5 cars in front of us there had just been an accident and there was a vehicle overturned in the middle of the road. I was in the front passenger seat and as we stopped, the person driving and I jumped out and started walking up the road towards the accident. 

The vehicle and rolled into the opposite lane, hit the gravel on the opposite shoulder and rolled, flipping several times and coming to a rest on its side in the middle of the road. As we walked up there were items strewn along the side of the road and the first thing that caught my eye was a couple rolls of blue stickies. These were rolls or blue stickers we used to mark the end of each shelf as we did inventory and every one of us always carried at least a roll of them on our belts. The van that crashed was one of ours and those were our co-workers up ahead. 

I remember the sinking feeling at the time and I remember the feeling i had of being scared to go up closer in case I saw something I wouldn't be able to unsee. Looking at the people who were traveling with me, I knew none of them were up to it so I went. There were already probably 10 or 15 people there from the cars in front of us and I could see someone getting helped out of the overturned van. 

As I got closer there was a body laying face down in the road probably 20 feet before the van. As I got closer I saw one of their shoes was missing and there was a big hole in the heel of their sock. There was someone leaning down over them checking for a pulse. There apparently was none and I realized the van had rolled over them and they were gone. At the van there were three people who had been traveling in this who were being helped. Two were sitting down and people were comforting them and checking them over. One had an obvious hand injury but the other seemed fine. The third was just walking around, seemingly oblivious to everything going on around them. All three obviously in shock. A further 50 feet down the road there was another body laying on the pavement. Someone was walking back towards me and they said, ""I was in the car behind, I saw him get ejected and fly through the air."" There were a couple people beside the body but I could tell by their demeanor, he was definitely gone as well. I didn't know it at the time but there was a sixth person. They had also been ejected but landed on the slope of the ditch but despite having a broken hip and several other injuries, would survive.

There was nothing I could do up there at the accident site. There were plenty of people there already and at the time, I didn't have any first aid training so I went back towards my car mates and told them what was going on; that there were fatalities, which van it was, and that everyone was in hand. They were all visibly upset, some crying, some just looking.
It had been 5 minutes or so since the accident and it would be another 45 minutes before the ambulances would show up. 

I knew there was at least three more van loads of people we worked with headed our way. I walked back and as each van showed up I told them what had happened and what I knew. The last van was pulling a trailer and held the manager of our team and some other people in charge.

Eventually the police and ambulances showed up, the police closed the highway and after the ambulances left and the bodies had been removed we needed to head back from where we had come. The highway was to remain closed for several more hours for accident investigation. 

At this point, it had been hours, a heavy fog had rolled in and it had gotten cold. The manager asked me if i could drive their van, pulling the trailer back because they were afraid to. I did, and we made our way back. By the time I got to a hotel room it was close to midnight. 

The next morning everyone was still upset. Some of the survivors had been released from the hospital. The guy with the broken hip had been airlifted to a trauma center I think. I don't remember if it was that day or the next but at some point I was asked if I would be willing to go and get people's personal effects from the vehicle which the police had at a garage to check for mechanical issues. I agreed to go along with an older lady who worked with us. The simple fact was no one else looked up to doing it. 

The van was heavily damaged. All the windows were either cracked or totally smashed. The roof was partially caved in and all sides and corners were broken. There was a little bit of blood in the car but not much. We took the bags that were there. Anything that was loose had been ejected during the accident so there wasn't much besides the bags. 

A few days later we drove with the survivors back to meet up with the rest of our group. I won't get into that but they weren't happy to see all of us. 

The girl who was driving had fallen asleep at the wheel. Unfortunately, everyone else in the van had as well, including the three who were ejected who had taken off their seat belts to be more comfortable. The passenger woke up as they hit the gravel on the opposite shoulder and in the panic to swerve back over, rolled the van.

Today I drove over that section of highway for the first time in a long time and it made me think of that day and of Shane and Richard. Richard was a new father so I guess his kid is an adult now. 

The thing I realized about myself that day is that I'm calmer in those situations than I expected and less affected by them than I had feared. Just wanted to share it. ",1,1753466463.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

It's always the basics we overlook.

Let me share what I see over and over again:

The Big Three Performance Destroyers

First up - Images that are way too massive

You know that feeling when you upload a 5MB hero image straight from your camera? Yeah, that's why mobile users hit the back button before your page even loads.

What actually works: Convert everything to WebP and lazy load anything below the fold. I had one client whose homepage went from ""grab a coffee while it loads"" to ""boom, it's there"" just by doing this properly.

Second - JavaScript packages you're barely using

We've all done it - imported an entire library just to use one tiny function. It's like buying a whole toolbox when you only need a screwdriver.

The fix that actually matters: Set up tree shaking and only load heavy components when users actually need them. One site I worked on improved their Core Web Vitals by 40% just by cleaning up unused JavaScript.

Third - CSS frameworks eating your bandwidth

Loading all of Bootstrap or Tailwind when you're using maybe 5% of it? That's like packing your entire wardrobe for a weekend trip.

What makes the difference: Use PurgeCSS or extract only the critical styles you actually need. I've seen CSS files go from 200KB+ down to 20KB without losing any functionality.

My Quick ""Is My Site Slow?"" Checklist

If any of these are yes, fix them first. You'll probably solve your speed issues right there.

Tools That Don't Waste Your Time

Lighthouse - Gives you the full picture without the fluff

Bundle Analyzer - Shows you exactly what's bloating your JavaScript

Chrome DevTools Coverage - Highlights unused CSS and JS so you know what to cut

Let's Talk Real Experiences

What's the most ridiculous performance issue you've stumbled across? I once found a site loading a 10MB image for a 50px favicon. No joke.

Got any tools or tricks that saved your sanity? Always looking for new ways to speed up the debugging process.

How do you usually tackle performance problems? Do you have a go-to workflow, or do you just dive in and see what happens?

Don't overthink it. Most slow websites aren't slow because of complex technical issues - they're slow because someone forgot to optimize the basics. Fix the obvious stuff first, and you will solve most problems without breaking a sweat.",0,1753466445.0,webdev,2,0.4,False

(Quick Intro) So¬† I‚Äôm a (38 M)¬† who's going to celebrate the third anniversary coming out as Goth this year! For so long I have been trying to find my own identity. I came out gay a long time ago but came out publicly back in 2013, but have been empty because I had yet found myself for lack of a better word. It was at a friend‚Äôs birthday party we went to a goth bar, to show support I dressed up and when I saw myself in the mirror It was like that moment in the 2006¬† film ‚Äú Memoirs of a geisha when the main character saw herself dressed up in a mirror for the first time‚Äù¬† The night after I felt incomplete.¬†

I realized unconsciously I had been since high school from 15 I wore black clothes and felt connected to alternative group the small goth community of teens that went to our school, I was shy so never hung out with them but I loved the music they listened to and would sit nearby and draw while secretly enjoying it because I knew if I tried playing that type of music at home I would get in trouble. My grandmother never knew this but eventually¬† would make me buy clothes with more color claiming I had way too many black shirts, and pants so I was eventually forced to wear colors.¬†¬†

Years later after that Birthday event¬† and learning more about the goth community¬† and feeling a strong connection I made a decision and threw out all these nasty Grandpa¬† knitted vests and colorful button downs in exchange for clothes that didn't make me 20 years older and matched my aesthetic. I put on my makeup and black lipstick and I‚Äôve been doing it for years‚Ä¶ However,¬† the story I'm sharing today happened before the Gay Goth Cinderella.¬†

It started right around quarantine had finally ended and our apartment building allowed guests to enter and visit.¬† I‚Äôm not into the relationship thing due to trauma but I sought out Fwb Im also not comfortable making the first approach so it hasn't been easy to meet people unless introduced or they make the approach first so I tried to reach out to people from an app (yes¬† I know bad Idea)¬† I found someone let‚Äôs call him Ted, who was very nice and a gentlemen and older then me seeking younger.¬† At the time my profile photo and my appearance was simple and boring¬† and we‚Äôll leave it there. This guy wanted to meet up. I chose a coffee place, we chatted, got to know each other,¬† and eventually hooked up for¬† hang outs and sex.¬† ¬† However¬† Ted would ask me strange questions after I shared Tibet's of my past.

They started out simple like, Are you in Nursing, are you a caregiver,¬† do you have caregiving skills,¬† but then got deeper from asking me if I‚Äôm good at house keeping,¬† cleaning,¬† and things people normally ask a caregiver, maid or house cleaner. ¬† Ted hang outs soon began to become non existent but with the occasional¬† text message that only seem to pop up on holidays like new years, Valentine's, St Patrick's day, memorial day etc, I would reach out but I never would get¬† response and if I did it was for a message that happened 6 months ago.

When we did chat he would say how he missed hanging out, his hip hasn‚Äôt been doing good so he‚Äôs been working out wanting to get in shape for me, he then asked questions on what I've been doing and when I mention hangouts with friends his reaction when they were male friends was very interrogative,¬† the kind only those in a relationship suspecting their partner is cheating interrogative.

Ted and I as far as I knew were a Fwb¬† we weren't in a committed relationship and if he thought we were, that‚Äôs news to me since he spoke of his other fwb when we were together and never hinted he wanted to graduate from that which sadly wouldn't happen since I wasn't ready for anything serious.¬†

I've a female friend will call them Clayton¬† full female just a boy‚Äôs name whenever I spoke of hangouts with Clayton Ted would get defensive once again the overboard jealous boyfriend type of behavior and I would have to remind them Clayton was a girl just had a boy‚Äôs name, They would immediately get sweet again but inquire if I was still single.¬† 6-7 times which I confirmed.¬†

When Ted tells me he‚Äôs getting into shape etc for me and he‚Äôs also working on getting surgery for his hip I wish him luck he set he text me soon, soon was once again during¬† days with holidays and when I tried to inquire how he was etc no answer, ever when I texted him things, again no answer. I figured he was no longer interested in hangout or hooking up which was fine because¬† it wasn't anything serious and I was also sensing red flags and predicted the following was either going to happen.¬† He was either going to want this to be a cemented relationship, OR¬† was going to be asked to be a caregiver for this said surgery under the guise of a hook up, or he was going for all the above. ¬† Because our last conversations had either been caregiving questions, cleaning skills,¬† promises to hangout and then radio silence.

(quick back story)¬† Before anyone asks why he was asking about cleaning and caregiving questions here is the answer.¬† My grandmother developed dementia and had to be taken care of. I had to shut down my mini self built business of selling my art for a little extra money to help her out because her two daughters that I nicknamed the Nazi aunts wanted to throw her into a shady¬† senior living home for the elderly.¬† I was 23 at the time and had to be in a way a parent to my grandmother and endure ridiculement by the aunts who didn't do an ounce of help¬† just criticise,¬† do smear campaigns¬† etc.¬† It was hard work but I did it because I loved my grandmother and did what I could to my best ability but was blamed for everything when she passed away.¬† I told Ted this when he asked about my family and why I didn't stay in contact with them and henceforth that‚Äôs where the questions he asked started.¬†

¬†I ended up staying with my sister and her full grown son who were all lazy b@stards who never cleaned up after themselves and I was the one who did most of the cleaning and when I did I got verbally and sometimes physically abused if I didn't clean their 6 months old dishes that they dirtied themselves. I‚Äôd clean my dishes but not there's any whenever they caught me doing it tell me how to wash then get¬† p\*ssed when I said I'm not washing your dishes just the plate and utensils I ate from.¬† As soon as I¬† found a place and moved out (escape is a better word) I told myself I'd never¬† do this cr@p again!¬†

I made it clear in the beginning to Ted¬† when he asked I would be no one‚Äôs caregiver , house cleaner,¬† or special Butt wiper. I've sacrificed and taken care of people half my life with nothing in return but abuse and being blamed for not contributing or doing things correctly.¬† I will not be doing it again

June 2025¬† I get a message from Ted apologizing for not¬† reaching out for so long. He tells me he misses my bootie, wants to meet once a week and in early July is having surgery and would appreciate it if I could take care of him and his house etc. ¬† At this time I am trying to move out of the insane area.¬† Even if I wasn't busy I wouldn't because I made it clear I don't do that! ¬† I knew this was going to happen so I told him the following: I can't. I'm sorry but I told you I‚Äôm not a care giver or a house keeper.¬†¬†

Ted wasn‚Äôt happy, He accused me of seeing someone else¬† that he thought we had a thing for. I reminded him it was a FWB that what he had been seeking and that‚Äôs what I¬† had been seeking he never told me he wanted to pursue anything other than a FWB.¬† it was on the verge of getting heated so I blocked his number, he¬† then found my fbook and tried to send a friend request. I blocked him there, he tried my Instagram, blocked him there.¬† He tried wishing me a happy 4th on the old site I met him on, Guess what?¬† I blocked him there too!¬†

So in conclusion¬† AITA for reminding him we were never in a relationship and saying no to being his house keeper or caregiver?¬†

1m966n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1m966n5/does_the_soyajoy_g5_milk_maker_deliver_on/,Does the SoyaJoy G5 Milk Maker Deliver on Versatility and Quality?,"The SoyaJoy G5 caught my attention as someone who drinks more plant-based milk than most people guzzle coffee. Having tested it daily for a couple of weeks, I found this device to be a fascinating mix of convenience, thoughtful features, and occasional quirks. Designed to handle everything from soy milk to almond milk and even soups, this machine boasts a self-cleaning function and multiple user-friendly options. Naturally, I dove right into all its capabilities. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve discovered along the way.

**Design and Build Quality**

This milk maker feels sturdy right out of the box. The 1.6L stainless-steel cooking chamber initially grabbed my attention, as it promised durability and an easy-to-clean surface. Unlike cheaper plastic alternatives, the stainless-steel finish doesn‚Äôt just serve an aesthetic purpose; it‚Äôs a lifesaver when working with varying temperatures. Coupled with its insulating plastic exterior, the machine stays cool during operation, even when it‚Äôs working on hot blends. The white finish is sleek and blends well with most modern kitchens, but at a weight of 7.12 pounds, moving it isn‚Äôt the easiest task. I‚Äôd call it countertop-friendly, provided you don‚Äôt stash it away after every use.

**Ease of Use**

Using the machine doesn‚Äôt require a PhD in kitchen appliances‚Äîeverything is straightforward, thanks to the push-button controls and the new LED display. Whether I wanted a quick batch of oat milk or decided to experiment with quinoa milk, the operation was seamless. The intelligent sensors kept things fuss-free. I didn‚Äôt experience boil-overs thanks to the water-level and dual boil-over sensors, which let me multitask while the SoyaJoy G5 handled the rest.

**Advantages**

- The LED display with a timer makes operations clear and transparent.  
- Intelligent sensors take care of temperature control, ensuring mess-free and efficient processing.  
- The patented Precision Grinding Funnel enhances the consistency of your milk, providing smoother and richer results.  
- Designed to work with both soaked and dry beans, offering flexibility depending on how much prep time I had.  

[Check SoyaJoy G5 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b089r6ggll/)

**Performance and Applications**

Performance is where this thing really shines. The SoyaJoy G5 isn‚Äôt just a plant-based milk maker; it also serves up pureed soups, porridges, hot cocoa, and raw blends. The raw milk program caught my attention because it preserves nutrients by skipping the heating process. Whether it‚Äôs almond milk, soy milk, or even cashew milk, the Precision Grinding Funnel ensures ingredients are processed thoroughly‚Äîno grainy textures, just silky smooth beverages.

However, the standout feature for me was how it handled soups. My butternut squash soup turned out perfectly blended and heated evenly, making prep as simple as hitting a button. It‚Äôs a game-changer for busy folks who don‚Äôt want to spend hours in the kitchen.

**Negatives**

- At 9x10.5x15 inches, it‚Äôs not the most compact appliance for smaller kitchens.  
- While the advertised self-cleaning function works well, there were times it didn‚Äôt clear up stubborn bits entirely.  
- There‚Äôs no dedicated program for flavored milk‚Äîadding ingredients like vanilla or dates sometimes required a manual stir.  

**Competing Brands**

While the SoyaJoy G5 has plenty of great points, there are other devices in the same price spectrum worth considering. A popular rival, the NutraMilk Nut Processor, offers a more significant emphasis on high-speed blending, but it lacks the versatility of tackling cooked soups or porridge. Another alternative, the Almond Cow, specializes in plant-based milk but doesn‚Äôt quite reach the same silky richness SoyaJoy achieves with its Precision Grinding Funnel. The trade-off for these other devices is often simplicity over functionality; the G5 wins when you want an all-in-one performer.

**Worth Every Penny**

Is the SoyaJoy G5 worth the investment? For a multi-functional milk maker that promises long-term durability, the price point feels justified. While some single-task devices may cost slightly less, they rarely offer the same combination of versatility and reliability. It‚Äôs a wise choice for plant-based enthusiasts who don‚Äôt mind paying for quality and thoughtful design. Still, if you‚Äôre only interested in making occasional plant milk, there might be less expensive alternatives elsewhere.

1m966e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/1m966e0/love_letter_to_portland_fuck_livenation/,Love Letter to Portland (Fuck Livenation),"Dear Portland,

I love you, but lately, you confuse me. I know neither of us is as young or as cool as we thought we used to be, but we still care about the same things, don‚Äôt we? We still value the same things, right?

I remember we used to go for walks and we'd stop in a quaint coffee shop, just watching the wonderfully weird people pass by the window on their way to do something we were sure was too cool for us to even know about. Or we‚Äôd see the guy at ""Live at Five"" with the fancy suit on and think, ""Woah, that‚Äôs a real grown-up."" Well, I‚Äôm probably the same age as that real grown-up now, and I own one suit, but it has a stain from sitting in something weird.

Why am I telling you this? I don‚Äôt know, but Fuck LiveNation.

I get the appeal, I really do. You look at a project that promises to give you 44 million dollars a year, and you think, ""Wow, no one has ever loved me like that before."" But you‚Äôre wrong. You‚Äôve been loved like that, right under your nose, for decades. You just never valued it. Sure, you‚Äôd write about it in your brochures, along with talking about our amazing independent restaurant scene.

Remember in 2006 when Hooters wanted to come in and you put a moratorium on the project, then changed the zoning so they couldn‚Äôt cheapen the food scene? That was great. You used to really stand for something.

But I guess I wonder, what‚Äôs changed?  
Is it me?  
Is it my friends?  
Or is it you?

I mean, my friends all moved out of town because they just couldn‚Äôt afford you anymore, so it can‚Äôt be them. You said it was all in the name of progress, and I believed you. I didn‚Äôt agree, but I trusted your judgment. It can‚Äôt be me. I‚Äôve been nice to you. I‚Äôve paid my taxes, supported your businesses, and generally tried to make you a better place in whatever ways I can.  
It must be you.

Where was I going with this?  
Oh right, Fuck LiveNation.

Your current involvement with LiveNation is really at odds with who I thought you were. When I met you, we were both a little rough around the edges, figuring out who we were. But one thing was for sure, we had character. You even named a whole district after how artsy you thought you were.

Venues came and went, but they always lived or died by the work that the community put in to them. Sometimes they died because you let the rich people who bought condos downtown tell you it was too loud, but that‚Äôs another story not worth relitigating (we‚Äôll always have The Ale House).

You seem to be going all in with LiveNation, but do you really know them? You know they‚Äôre being sued by the federal government and forty state attorneys general, right? They‚Äôre being sued for doing exactly what we‚Äôre all afraid they‚Äôre going to do here.

I know they said they won‚Äôt do that here, but you believed them? I thought you were smarter than that. Even the Trump administration is smarter than that. They‚Äôre still suing them, despite LiveNation putting Trump cronies on their board and bribing them with 500,000 dollars for their little inauguration party.

But whatever. You can‚Äôt say no to something just because of politics. I get it.

But will you at least think of the other businesses that will be affected by this? All those businesses that made this the kind of place they want to exploit?

Before handing over a set of keys to our cultural identity, just think about who got you here. Think about the businesses that give back to the community because they care about the community, even though you dont really give back to them.

You love talking about the arts, and with good reason, it's incredible, but you do know that you provide less funding for the arts than any other similarly sized city in the Northeast, right?

Getting back to the district you named for the arts, it seems like there‚Äôs been a lot of talk lately about how many of the stores there are closing, leaving vacancies. Can you imagine what it will be like when empty storefronts become empty performance halls and theaters?

Doesn‚Äôt really sound like much of an arts district anymore, does it?

Some people call what we‚Äôre talking about ""the Walmart effect."" And while this is similar, Walmart just has just that, an effect. LiveNation has intention, and their intention is to consolidate your little artsy things into several caverns of unrelenting consumerism.

Did you know they even own the company that puts the water in the cans you buy for seven dollars to feel better about not buying a fourteen dollar PBR? I know you‚Äôll just say they‚Äôre good businessmen, but the government calls them a criminal enterprise (their words, not mine).

In any case, I know we can work this out. I think maybe you just need to take some time and really think about this. I‚Äôm here for you if you have any questions.

I still think you‚Äôre great.  
You maybe just forgot where you came from a little bit.  
We all need a reminder sometimes.

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a S√ºper Lig showdown that‚Äôs less ‚Äúepic rivalry‚Äù and more ‚ÄúGalatasaray flexing their bank account while Gaziantep hopes for a miracle.‚Äù The stage is set for August 8, 2025, as Galatasaray, the Istanbul giants, trek to Gaziantep to kick off their title defense. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Turkish timekeeper and the humor of a stadium announcer who‚Äôs had one too many *simit* sandwiches.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Galatasaray‚Äôs Implied Probability Feels Like a Tax Audit

The numbers don‚Äôt lie (well, bookmakers do, but let‚Äôs pretend they don‚Äôt). Galatasaray is a **71-72% favorite** to win, per the consensus odds (-1.25 spread, decimal 1.38-1.40). That‚Äôs the statistical equivalent of ordering a *kuru fasulye* and getting a side of ‚Äúobvious.‚Äù Gaziantep? They‚Äôre priced at **15-19%**, which is about the same chance as me understanding why someone would pay ‚Ç¨10 for a stadium hot dog. The draw? A **21-22%** shot‚Äîperfect for fans who enjoy watching two teams play chess with a football.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: Galatasaray‚Äôs -1.25 spread means they‚Äôre expected to win by *more than a goal and a half*. If you‚Äôre betting on them, you‚Äôre not just picking the better team‚Äîyou‚Äôre betting they‚Äôll perform like a Turkish coffee shop in rush hour (i.e., *very* efficient).

---

### Friendly Frenzy: Galatasaray‚Äôs Prep Games Were a Cooking Show

Galatasaray‚Äôs pre-season has been a culinary metaphor waiting to happen. They‚Äôve ‚Äúwhipped up‚Äù a 5-2, 2-1, and 3-1 in friendlies‚Äîthink of it as a *manti* dumpling: tasty, but not exactly a Michelin star. Their offense? A food processor. Their defense? A sieve that‚Äôs been sieved by √úmraniyespor, Admira Wacker, and Cagliari.

Meanwhile, Gaziantep‚Äôs news is‚Ä¶ spa

1m963z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahInfluencerDrama/comments/1m963z0/kennedy_a_question_for_the_culture/,Kennedy- a question for the culture,"All speculation, but consider this: 

1. Who has more to lose? Who commands the massive social platform, the loyal fanbase, the PR team, and, of course, the money?

2. Nearly two weeks ago, rumors gained traction. Who blew the whistle? Zach, with his unfollowing. Reddit corroborated stories of alleged her mistreatment of Zach. Her neurotic tendencies. Kennedy‚Äôs response? Silence. Photos stayed pinned. Follows remained. Comments hinting at divorce? Wiped.

3. Then Zach filed. Kennedy? Still silent. Until, conveniently, a Reddit post alleged ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù with only Zach handing a coffee to a blonde in his backseat as evidence. Cue the perfect narrative shift. 

4. Suddenly, Kennedy breaks her silence. No need to conceal the truth, just pivot. Post to a Madison Beer tiktok sound and let the fanbase rewrite the rumours. Her team surely knows nothing rallies a female audience like the ‚Äúscorned woman.‚Äù Notice her statement never explicitly mentions infidelity or abuse. She can‚Äôt risk defamation or breaching any divorce non-disparagement. But the connotation seems deliberate, and the burden of proof far heavier.

5. Amuse me: have you ever actually met Kennedy? Are her videos littered with friends? She seemingly only had Zach and blood. Everyone else? A parasocial shadow or, perhaps, mere acquaintance at best. 

6. Kennedy needs control like oxygen. She's smart. Probably calculated. The saccharine voice, the hand gestures‚Ä¶a curated persona. An amalgamation of the Kieser-esque influencer and media training.

7. But, sometimes, the cracks show. Look closer. Notice the snappy replies, the flickers of irritation, the frantic deletion of comments.

8. Now, amuse me once more: if Zach truly cheated, and she holds all the power, why would she leave the house she bought? Had he truly cheated, why not kick him out? Had that truly been the case, to maintain control, to garner public sympathy, she would have filed first, without hesitation. Any PR team would advise that, right? No two-week silence. No scrambling. He blindsided her. She‚Äôs embarrassed. Maybe, for the first time, she lost control.

9. The cheating rumor offered the perfect loophole to reclaim control. To spin the narrative. To save face.

10. In the end, those in power write the history books. So, a question for the culture: can you read between the lines?

Well, a month ago a new guy started delivering and he was totally my type. Single, bald, well groomed beard and mustache, great smile, dimples, around 5' 9"" and full bodied. If I had to guess, I'd say 210, but evenly distributed. 

I was his last delivery today, so I invited him in for coffee, but he was on his way to watch his grandson for the afternoon and asked if I'd like to get together for lunch tomorrow. I said yes, so fingers crossed.

He's really attractive and he smelled delicious. He's the first guy I've imagined having sex with in almost two years and it feels good to know my desire is as strong as ever.

I‚Äôm almost a year into my job (won‚Äôt get specific but I work in a lab) and my lab is post docs and post baccs. I was hired as a biologist, I‚Äôm pretty young (early 20s) and got my bachelors in biology and have plenty of experience from my previous jobs.

I have some post docs who think highly of themselves and are always rude or belittling the post baccs. Is this some sort of hierarchy or what? I‚Äôm always kind to them and help them if they need it cause that‚Äôs what I was hired for. It got so bad that some of the post baccs left cause they felt useless at their position or were looked down upon by the post docs. It was honestly really sad and I‚Äôm pretty sure my boss favors the post docs cause there was some post baccs expressing frustration but nothing was done. I was told by the post baccs if it wasn‚Äôt for me they would have left earlier and that I was the only person nice to them. 

Sadly I am only left with the post docs and it‚Äôs been an experience lol. They are belittling me by making me do mundane tasks they can easily do. They would rather mess up their study than have me assist or do it entirely. They are constantly whispering about me. There‚Äôs one that when they email me they downplay (if that‚Äôs the right word?) my position/title! She‚Äôll call me a technician when I was hired and my title is biologist. They talk to me in small simple terms. 

Since we have so many empty desks now they have all moved to one side together and I‚Äôm on my own side, but really I don‚Äôt care. I like my space and set it up the way I want it, so I wasn‚Äôt moving. One of them was whispering to someone from another lab today about me. Keep in mind these people are late 30s, some married‚Ä¶.

I do my scheduled hours and will stick around if someone needs me. I come in early to do my work and everyone strolls in later than me so I leave earlier‚Ä¶but that seems to be an issue if I‚Äôm not leaving at the same time as them‚Ä¶.they claim I do nothing but that‚Äôs cause I get everything done before everyone gets in! And they‚Äôll get upset with me if they ask me for help but it‚Äôs the day of and it‚Äôs at 6pm on a weekend‚Ä¶.and I‚Äôll say no to ask the other scientist who‚Äôs here later. One of them has been delaying a project our boss has been demanding for months now and last time I saw her when I was getting coffee at the building, she was in the library just playing candy crush‚Ä¶.and saw her a couple other times doing that. 

It‚Äôs just frustrating working with people who think they are above me/micromanage. I know I‚Äôm younger but I went to college and got my degree. I secured a position at a reputable lab and then moved to this lab. Lately I have just been annoyed by how they treat me. Frankly I could care less if I‚Äôm not invited to happy hour cause these are not people I would want to be around! I have a social life outside of work and good friends. I do my job go to the gym go home and hang with my cats

1m95v6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m95v6t/i_am_the_messenger_by_markus_zusak_read_online/,I Am the Messenger by Markus Zusak Read online Free,"My full name's Ed Kennedy. I'm nineteen. I'm an underage cabdriver. I'm typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city--not a whole lot of prospects or possibility. That aside, I read more books than I should, and I'm decidedly crap at sex and doing my taxes. Nice to meet you.) ""Well, shut up, Ed!"" the gunman screams. Marv smirks. ""Or I'll come over there and shoot the arse off you!""  
  
¬† It's like being in school again and your sadistic math teacher's barking orders at you from the front of the room, even though he couldn't care less and he's waiting for the bell so he can go home and drink beer and get fat in front of the telly.  
  
¬† I look at Marv. I want to kill him. ""You're twenty years old, for Christ's sake. Are you trying to get us killed?""  
  
¬† ""Shut up, Ed!"" The gunman's voice is louder this time.  
  
¬† I whisper even quieter. ""If I get shot, I'm blaming you. You know that, don't you?""  
  
¬† ""I said shut up, Ed!""  
  
¬† ""Everything's just a big joke, isn't it, Marv?""  
  
¬† ""Right, that's it."" The gunm  
an forgets about the woman behind the counter and marches over to us, fed up as all buggery. When he arrives we all look up at him.  
  
¬† Marv.  
  
¬† Audrey.  
  
¬† Me.  
  
¬† And all the other hopeless articles like us sprawled out on the floor.  
  
¬† The end of the gun touches the bridge of my nose. It makes it itchy. I don't scratch it.  
  
¬† The gunman looks back and forth between Marv and me. Through the stocking on his face I can see his ginger whiskers and acne scars. His eyes are small and he has big ears. He's most likely robbing the bank as a payback on the world for winning the ugliness prize at his local fete three years running.  
  
¬† ""So which one of you's Ed?""  
  
¬† ""Him,"" I answer, pointing to Marv.  
  
¬† ""Oh no you don't,"" Marv counters, and I can tell by the look on his face that he isn't as afraid as he should be. He knows we'd both be dead by now if this gunman was the real thing. He looks up at the stocking-faced man and says, ""Hang on a sec...."" He scratches his jawline. ""You look familiar.""  
  
¬† ""Okay,"" I admit, ""I'm Ed."" But the gunman's too busy listening to what Marv has to say for himself.  
  
¬† ""Marv,"" I whisper loudly, ""shut up.""  
  
¬† ""Shut up, Marv,"" says Audrey.  
  
¬† ""Shut up, Marv!"" calls Ritchie from across the room.  
  
¬† ""Who the hell are you?"" the gunman calls across to Ritchie. He turns to find out where the voice came from.  
  
¬† ""I'm Ritchie.""  
  
¬† ""Well, shut yourself up, Ritchie! Don't you start!""  
  
¬† ""No worries,"" returns the voice. ""Thanks a lot."" All my friends seem to be smart arses. Don't ask me why. Like many things, it is what it is.  
  
¬† In any case, the gunman starts to seethe. It seems to come pouring from his skin, right through the stocking on his face. ""I'm completely bloody sick of this,"" he growls. His voice burns from his lips.  
  
¬† It doesn't shut Marv up, though.  
  
¬† ""I think,"" he continues, ""we might've gone to school together or something like that, you know?""  
  
¬† ""You want to die,"" the gunman says nervously, still seething, ""don't you?""  
  
¬† ""Well, actually,"" Marv explains, ""I just want you to pay the parking fine for my car. It's in a fifteen-minute zone outside. You're holding me up here.""  
  
¬† ""Damn right I am!"" He points the gun.  
  
¬† ""There's no need to be that hostile.""  
  
¬† Oh God, I think. Marv's gone now. He's about to get shot in the throat.  
  
¬† The gunman looks out the glass doors of the bank, trying to figure out which car belongs to Marv. ""Which one is it?"" he inquires--politely enough, I must say.  
  
¬† ""The light blue Falcon there.""  
  
¬† ""That piece of shit? I wouldn't piss on it, let alone pay a fine on it.""  
  
¬† ""Now hang on a second."" Marv's getting all offended again. ""Since you're holding up the bank, the least you can do is pay my parking fine, don't you think?""  
  
¬† Meanwhile.  
  
¬† The money's ready at the counter and Misha, the poor behind-the-counter girl, calls out. The gunman turns and heads back for it.  
  
¬† ""Hurry up, bitch,"" he barks at her as she hands it over. I assume this is the mandatory tone for a holdup. He's seen the appropriate movies, all right. Soon he's on his way back to us, money in hand.  
  
¬† ""You!"" he screams at me. He's found new courage now that he's got the money. He's about to hit me with his gun when something catches his attention outside.  
  
¬† He looks closer.  
  
¬† Out the glass doors of the bank.  
  
¬† A slab of sweat falls from his throat.  
  
¬† He breathes hard.  
  
¬† His thoughts churn, and...  
  
¬† He goes off.  
  
¬† ""No!""  
  
¬† The police are outside, but they have no idea what's happening in the bank. Word hasn't made it to the street yet. They're telling someone in a gold Torana to stop double-parking outside the bakery across the road. The car moves on and so do the cops, and the useless gunman is left holding the bag of money. His ride's gone.  
  
¬† An idea hits him.  
  
¬† He turns again.  
  
¬† Back to us.  
  
¬† ""You,"" he orders Marv. ""Give us your keys.""  
  
¬† ""What?""  
  
¬† ""You heard me.""  
  
¬† ""It's an antique, that car!""  
  
¬† ""It's a piece of shit, Marv,"" I abuse him. ""Now give him the keys or I'll kill you myself!""  
  
¬† With a disgruntled look on his face, Marv reaches into his pocket and pulls out his car keys.  
  
¬† ""Be gentle,"" he begs.  
  
¬† ""Blow me,"" the gunman replies.  
  
¬† ""There's no need for that!"" Ritchie yells from under the Lego table.  
  
¬† ""Shut up, you!"" the gunman yells back, and he's off.  
  
¬† His only problem is the fact that Marv's car has about a 5 percent chance of starting first time round.  
  
¬† The gunman bursts through the doors of the bank and is on his way toward the road. He stumbles and drops the gun near the entrance but decides to keep going without it. All in a second, I can see the panic on his face as he decides whether to pick it up again or go on. There's no time, so he leaves it and continues running.  
  
¬† As we all get to our knees to watch him, we see him approaching the car.  
  
¬† ""Watch this."" Marv begins to laugh. Audrey, Marv, and I all watch, and Ritchie's on his way over to us.  
  
¬† Outside, the gunman stops and tries to work out which key opens the car. That's when we all crack up laughing at the incompetence of him.  
  
¬† He eventually gets in and tries to start the car countless times, but it never kicks over.  
  
¬† Then.  
  
¬† For some reason I'll never understand.  
  
¬† I run out, picking up the gun along the way. When I cross the road, I lock eyes with the gunman. He attempts to get out of the car, but it's too late now for that.  
  
¬† I'm standing at the Ford's window.  
  
¬† I have the gun pointed at his eyes.  
  
¬† He stops.  
  
¬† We both do.  
  
¬† He tries to get out and run, and I swear I have no idea I'm firing the gun until I've stepped toward him and hear the glass shatter.  
  
¬† ""What are you doing?"" Marv cries out in pain from the other side of the street. His world is crumbling. ""That's my car you're shooting!""  
  
¬† Sirens arrive.  
  
¬† The gunman falls to his knees.  
  
¬† He says, ""I'm such an idiot.""  
  
¬† I can only agree.  
  
¬† For a moment, I look down and pity him because I realize that I'm quite possibly looking at the most hapless man on earth. First of all, he robs a bank with unutterably stupid people like Marv and me inside it. Then his getaway car vanishes. Then, when he's onto a good thing because he knows how to get his hands on a different car, it's the most pathetic car in the Southern Hemisphere. In a way, I feel sorry for him. Imagine it--the humiliation.  
  
¬† As the cops put the handcuffs on him and lead him away, I say to Marv, ""Now do you see?"" I continue on and become more forceful. Louder. ""Do you see? This only goes to show the patheticness""--I point to it--""of this car."" I pause a moment to let him think it over. ""If it was even half decent, this bloke would've got away now, wouldn't he?""  
  
¬† Marv admits it. ""I guess.""  
  
¬† It's actually hard to tell if he would have preferred the gunman to get away simply to prove his car isn't so useless.  
  
¬† There's glass on the road and all over the seats of the car. I try to figure out which is more shattered--the window or Marv's face.  
  
¬† ""Hey,"" I say, ""sorry about the window, okay?""  
  
¬† ""Forget it,"" Marv answers.  
  
¬† The gun feels warm and sticky, like melting chocolate in my hand.  
  
¬† Some more cops arrive to ask questions.  
  
¬† We go down to the police station and they ask us about the robbery, what happened, and how I managed to get my hands on the gun.  
  
¬† ""He just dropped it?""  
  
¬† ""That's what I told you, didn't I?""  
  
¬† ""Look, son,"" the cop says. He looks up from his papers. ""There's no need to get shirty with me."" He's got a beer gut and a graying mustache. Why do so many cops feel the need to own a mustache?  
  
¬† ""Shirty?"" I ask.  
  
¬† ""Yes, shirty.""  
  
¬† Shirty.  
  
¬†  
I quite like that word.  
  
¬† ""Sorry,"" I tell him. ""He just dropped it on his way out, and I picked it up as I went to chase him. That's all. He was a complete shocker, all right?""  
  
¬† ""Right.""  
  
¬† We're in there for quite a while. The only time the beer-gutted cop becomes unsettled is when Marv keeps asking for compensation on his car.  
  
¬† ""The blue Falcon?"" the cop asks.  
  
¬† ""That's the one.""  
  
¬† ""To be blunt, son--that car's an absolute outrage. It's disgraceful.""  
  
¬† ""I told you,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""It doesn't even have a hand brake, for Christ's sake.""  
  
¬† ""So?""  
  
¬† ""So you're lucky we're not fining you for it--it's unroadworthy.""  
  
¬† ""Thanks a lot.""  
  
¬† The cop smiles. ""My pleasure.""  
  
¬† ""And let me give you some advice.""  
  
¬† We're almost out the door when we realize the cop still isn't finished. He calls us back, or at least he calls Marv.  
  
¬† ""Yeah?"" Marv replies.  
  
¬† ""Why don't you get a new car, son?""  
  
¬† Marv looks seriously at the man. ""I have my reasons.""  
  
¬† ""What--no money?""  
  
¬† ""Oh, I've got money all right. I do work, you know."" He even manages to sound sanctimonious. ""I just have other priorities."" He smiles now, as only someone who's proud of a car like that could possibly manage. ""That--and I love my car.""  
  
¬† ""Fair enough,"" the cop concludes. ""Goodbye.""  
  
¬† ""What priorities have you, of all people, got?"" I ask Marv on the other side of the door.  
  
¬† Marv looks straight ahead blankly.  
  
¬† ""Just shut up, Ed,"" he says. ""You might be a hero to most people today, but to me you're just the dirty prick who put a bullet in my window.""  
  
¬† ""You want me to pay for it?""  
  
¬† Marv allows me another smile. ""No.""  
  
¬† To be quite honest, that's a relief. I'd rather die than put a solitary cent into that Falcon.  
  
¬† When we walk out of the police station, Audrey and Ritchie are waiting for us, but they're not alone. There are media people there as well, and a whole load of photos are taken.  
  
¬† ""That's him!"" someone calls, and before I can argue, the whole crowd is in my face, asking questions. I answer as fast as I can, explaining again what happened. The town I live in isn't small, and there are radio, TV, and newspaper people, all of whom will be presenting stories and writing articles for the next day.  
  
¬† I imagine the headlines.  
  
¬† Something like ""Taxi Driver Turns to Hero"" would be nice, but they'll probably print something like ""Local Deadbeat Makes Good."" Marv will get a good laugh out of that one.  
  
¬† After maybe ten minutes of questions, the crowd disperses and we walk back to our parking spot. The Falcon's got a nice big ticket slapped on the windscreen, under the wiper.  
  
¬† ""Bastards,"" Audrey states as Marv rips it off and reads it. We were in the bank in the first place so Marv could deposit his paycheck. He can use it for the fine now.  
¬†We attempt to wipe the glass off the seats and get in. Marv turns the key about eight times. It won't start.  
  
¬† ""Brilliant,"" he says.  
  
¬† ""Typical,"" replies Ritchie.  
  
¬† Audrey and I say nothing.  
  
¬† Audrey steers and the rest of us push. We take it back to my place since it's closest to town.  
  
¬† A few days later I'll get the first message.  
  
¬† It changes everything.  
  
¬† I'll tell you a bit about my life.  
  
¬† I play cards at least a few nights a week.  
  
¬† It's what we do.  
  
¬† We play a game called Annoyance, which isn't particularly hard and is the only game we all enjoy without arguing too much.  
  
¬† There's Marv, who never shuts up, sitting there trying to smoke cigars and simultaneously enjoy it.  
  
¬† There's Ritchie, who's always quiet, sporting his laughable tattoo on his right arm. He sips on his longneck beer from start to finish and touches the whiskers that seem glued in patches on his man-boyish face.  
  
¬† There's Audrey. Audrey always sits opposite me, no matter where we play. She has yellow hair, wiry legs, the most beautiful crooked smile in the world, and lovely hips, and she watches a lot of movies. She also works as a cabdriver.  
  
¬† Then there's me.  
  
¬† Before I even mention me, I should tell you some other facts: 1. At nineteen, Bob Dylan was a seasoned performer in Greenwich Village, New York.  
  
¬† 2. Salvador Dali had already produced several outstanding artworks of paint and rebellion by the time he was nineteen.  
  
¬† 3. Joan of Arc was the most wanted woman in the world at nineteen, having created a revolution.  
  
¬† Then there's Ed Kennedy, also nineteen....  
  
¬† Just prior to the bank holdup, I'd been taking stock of my life.  
  
¬† Cabdriver--and I'd funked my age at that. (You need to be twenty.) No real career.  
  
¬† No respect in the community.  
  
¬† Nothing.  
  
¬† I'd realized there were people everywhere achieving greatness while I was taking directions from balding businessmen called Derek and being wary of Friday-night drunks who might throw up in my cab or do a runner on me. It was actually Audrey's idea to give cab driving a shot. It didn't take much to convince me, mainly because I'd been in love with her for years. I never left this suburban town. I didn't go to university. I went to Audrey.  
  
¬† Constantly, I'm asking myself, Well, Ed--what have you really achieved in your nineteen years? The answer's simple.  
  
¬† Jack shit.  
  
¬† I mentioned it to a few different people, but all they did was tell me to pull my head in. Marv called me a first-class whinger. Audrey told me I was twenty years too early for a midlife crisis. Ritchie simply looked at me as if I was speaking in a foreign tongue. And when I mentioned it to my ma, she said, ""Ohhh, why don't you have a bloody cry, Ed."" You're going to love my ma. Trust me.  
  
¬† I live in a shack that I rent cheaply. Not long after moving in, I found out from the real estate agent that my boss is the owner. My boss is the proud founder and director of the cab company I drive for: Vacant Taxis. It's a dubious company, to say the least. Audrey and I had no trouble convincing them that we were old enough and licensed enough to drive for them. Mix a few numbers up on your birth certificate, show up with what appears to be the appropriate license, and you're set. We were driving within a week because they were short-staffed. No reference checks. No fuss. It's surprising what you can achieve with trickery and deceit. As Raskolnikov once said: ""When reason fails, the devil helps!"" If nothing else, I can lay claim to the title of Youngest Cabdriver in these parts--a taxi-driving prodigy. That's the kind of anti-achievement that gives structure to my life. Audrey's a few months older than me.  
  
¬† The shack I live in is pretty close to town, and since I'm not allowed to take the cab home, it's good walking distance to work. Unless Marv gives me a lift. The reason I don't have a car myself is that I drive people around all day or night. In my time off, the last thing I feel like doing is more driving.  
  
¬† The town we all live in is pretty run-of-the-mill. It's past the outskirts of the city and has good and bad parts. I'm sure it won't surprise you that I come from one of the bad parts. My whole family grew up at the far north of town, which is kind of like everyone's dirty secret. There are plenty of teenage pregnancies there, a plethora of shithead fathers who are unemployed, and mothers like mine who smoke, drink, and go out in public wearing Ugg boots. The home I grew up in was an absolute dump, but I stuck around until my brother, Tommy, finished school and got into university. At times I know I could have done the same, but I was too lazy at school. I was always reading books when I should have been doing math and the rest of it. Maybe I could have got a trade, but they don't give apprenticeships out down here, especially to the likes of me. Due to my aforementioned laziness I was no good at school, except at English, because of the reading. Since my father drank all our money away, I just went straight into work when school was done. I started out in a forgettable hamburger chain that I don't mention, due to shame. Next was sorting files in a dusty accountant's office that closed down within weeks of my arrival. And finally, the height, the pinnacle of my employment history so far.  
  
¬† Cab driving.  
  
¬† I have one housemate. He's called the Doorman, and he's seventeen years old. He sits at the flyscreen door, with sun painted onto his black fur. His old eyes glow. He smiles. He's called the Doorman because from a very early age he had a strong penchant for sitting by the front door. He did it back home, and he does it now at the shack. He likes to sit where it's nice and warm, and he doesn't let anyone in. This is because he finds it hard to move on account of the fact that he's so old. He's a cross between a Rottweiler and a German shepherd, and he stinks a kind of stink that's impossible to rid him of. In fact, I think that's why no one but my card-playing friends ever enters the shack. The initial stench of the dog slaps them in the face, and it's all over. No one's game enough to lengthen their stay and actually walk all the way in. I've even tried encouraging him to use some kind of deodorant. I've rubbed it under his arms in copious amounts. I've covered him all over with some of that Norsca spray, and all it did was make him smell worse. During that time, he smelled like a Scandinavian toilet.  
  
¬† He used to be my father's, but when the old man died about six months ago, my ma shifted him onto me. She got sick of him using the patch under her clothesline.  
  
¬† (""Anywhere in the whole backyard he could use!"" she'd say. ""But where does he do it?"" She'd answer the question. ""Right under the bloody clothesline."") So when I left, I took him with me.  
  
¬† To my shack.  
  
¬† To his door.  
  
¬† And he's happy.  
  
¬† And so am I.  
  
¬† He's happy when the sun throws warmth on him through the flyscreen door. He's happy to sleep there and move on a forward slant when I try to shut the wooden door at night. At times like that, I love the hell out of that dog. I love the hell out of him anyway. But Christ, he stinks.  
  
¬† I suppose he'll die soon. I'm expecting it, like you do for a dog that's seventeen. There's no way to know how I'll react. He'll have faced his own placid death and slipped without a sound inside himself. Mostly, I imagine I'll crouch there at the door, fall onto him, and cry hard into the stench of his fur. I'll wait for him to wake up, but he won't. I'll bury him. I'll carry him outside, feeling his warmth turn to cold as the horizon frays and falls down in my backyard. For now, though, he's okay. I can see him breathing. He just smells like he's dead.  
  
¬† I have a TV that needs time to warm up, a phone that almost never rings, and a fridge that buzzes like a radio.  
  
¬† There's a photo of my family on top of the TV from years ago.  
  
¬† Since I hardly ever watch the TV, I watch the photo once in a while. A pretty good show, really, although it gets dustier every day. It's a mother, a father, two sisters, me, and a younger brother. Half of us smile on the photo. Half don't. I like it.  
  
¬† In terms of my family, my ma's one of those tough women you couldn't kill with an ax. She's also developed a bit of a swearing habit, whic  
h I'll tell you more about later.  
  
¬† Like I said, my father died about six months ago. He was a lonely, kind, quiet, hard-drinking deadbeat. I could say that living with my ma wasn't easy and it drove him to drink, but there are no excuses. You can make them, but you don't believe them. He was a furniture deliverer. When he died they found him sitting on an old lounge chair still inside the truck. He was just sitting there, dead and relaxed. There was still so much to unpack, they said. They thought he was sitting in there bludging. His liver gave out.  
  
¬† My brother, Tommy, has done most things right. He's a year younger than me and goes to university in the city.  
  
¬† My sisters are Leigh and Katherine.  
  
¬† When Katherine got pregnant at seventeen, I cried. I was twelve then. She moved out of home soon after. She wasn't booted out or anything like that. She left and got married. It was a big event at the time.  
  
¬† A year later, when Leigh left, there were no problems.  
  
¬† She wasn't pregnant.  
  
¬† I'm the only one left in town these days. The others all left for the city and live there. Tommy's done especially well. He's on his way to becoming a lawyer. Good luck to him. I mean it.  
  
¬† Next to that picture on the TV, there's also a photo of Audrey, Marv, Ritchie, and me. We set the timer on Audrey's camera last Christmas, and there we are. Marv with cigar. Ritchie half smiling. Audrey laughing. And me holding my cards, still looking at the most shit hand in Christmas history.  
  
¬† I cook.  
  
¬† I eat.  
  
¬† I wash but I rarely iron.  
  
¬† I live in the past and believe that Cindy Crawford is by far the best supermodel.  
  
¬† That's my life.  
  
¬† I have dark hair, half-tanned skin, coffee brown eyes. My muscles are hugely normal. I should stand straighter, but I don't. I stand with my hands in my pockets. My boots are falling apart, but I still wear them because I love and cherish them.  
  
¬† Quite often, I pull my boots on and go out. Sometimes I go to the river that runs through town, or I go for a walk to the cemetery to see my father. The Doorman comes with me, of course, if he's awake.  
  
¬† What I like best is walking with my hands in my pockets, having the Doorman next to me, and imagining that Audrey's on my other side.  
  
¬† I always picture us from behind.  
  
¬† There's glow turning to darkness.  
  
¬† There's Audrey.  
  
¬† There's the Doorman.  
  
¬† There's me.  
  
¬† And I'm holding Audrey's fingers in mine.  
  
¬† I haven't written a song of Dylan proportions yet, or started painting my first attempt at surrealism, and I doubt I could start a revolution if I tried--because apart from everything else, I'm a bit of an unfit bastard, though I'm lanky and lean. Just weak, too.  
  
¬† Mainly, I think the best times I have are playing cards or when I've dropped someone off and I'm heading back to town, maybe from the city or even further north. The window's down, the wind runs its fingers through my hair, and I smile at the horizon.  
  
¬† Then I pull into town and the Vacant Taxis lot.  
  
¬† Sometimes I hate the sound of a car door slamming.  
  
¬† Like I've said, I love Audrey something terrible.  
  
¬† Audrey, who's had plenty of sex with plenty of people but never with me. She's always said she likes me too much to do it with me, and, personally, I've never tried to get her naked and new and all shivery in front of me. I'm too afraid. I've told you already that I'm quite pathetic when it comes to sex. I've had a girlfriend or two, and they didn't exactly rave about me in the sexual encounter department. One of them told me I was the clumsiest guy she'd ever met. The other one always laughed when I tried something on her. It didn't really work wonders on me, and she quit me soon after.  
  
¬† Personally, I think sex should be like math.  
  
¬† At school.  
  
¬† No one really cares if they're crap at math. They even proclaim it. They'll say to anyone, ""Yeah, I don't mind science and English, but I'm absolutely shithouse at math."" And other people will laugh and say, ""Yeah, me, too. I wouldn't have a clue about all that logarithm shit.""  
  
¬† You should be able to say that about sex, too.  
  
¬† You should be able to proudly say, ""Yeah, I wouldn't have a clue about all that orgasm shit, ay. I'm okay at everything else, but when it comes to that part I wouldn't have a clue.""  
  
¬† No one says that, though.  
  
¬† You can't.  
  
¬† Especially men.  
  
¬† We men think we have to be good at it, so I'm here to tell you I'm not. I should also explain that I honestly think my kissing leaves a lot to be desired as well. One of those girlfriends tried to teach me once, but I think she gave up in the end. My tongue work is particularly bad, I feel, but what can I do?  
  
¬† It's only sex.  
  
¬† That's what I tell myself, anyway.  
  
¬† I lie a lot.  
  
¬† Getting back to Audrey, though, I should really feel complimented that she won't even touch me because she likes me more than anyone else. It makes perfect sense, really, doesn't it?  
  
¬† If she ever gets down or depressed, I can make out the figure of her shadow through the front window of the shack. She comes in and we drink cheap beer or wine or watch a movie or all three. Something old and long like Ben-Hur that stretches into the night. She'll be next to me on the couch in her flannel shirt and jeans that have been cut into shorts, and eventually, when she's asleep, I'll bring a blanket out and cover her up.  
  
¬† I kiss her cheek.  
  
¬† I stroke her hair.  
  
¬† I think of how she lives alone, just like me, and how she never had any real family, and how she only has sex with people. She never lets any love get in the way. I think she had a family once, but it was one of those beat-the-crap-out-of-each-other situations. There's no shortage of them around here. I think she loved them, and all they ever did was hurt her.  
  
¬† That's why she refuses to love.  
  
¬† Anybody.  
  
¬† I guess she feels better off that way, and who can blame her?  
  
¬† When she sleeps on my couch, I think about all that. Every time. I cover her up, then go to bed and dream.  
  
¬† With my eyes open.  
  
¬† There have been a few articles about the bank robbery in the local papers. They talk about how I wrestled the gun from the thief after chasing him down. Quite typical, really. I knew they'd make more out of it.  
  
¬† I go through some of them at my kitchen table, and the Doorman just looks at me like always. He couldn't give a shit if I'm a hero. As long as he gets his dinner on time, he doesn't have a care in the world.  
  
¬† My ma comes over, and I give her a beer. She's proud, she tells me. According to her, all her kids have done quite well except me, but now she at least has a glimmer of pride in me to glimmer in her eye, if only for a day or two.  
  
¬† ""That was my son,"" I can imagine her explaining to people she meets on the street. ""I told you he'd amount to something one day.""  
  
¬† Marv comes over, of course, and Ritchie.  
  
¬† Even Audrey pays me a visit with a newspaper tucked under her arm.  
  
¬† In each article, I'm known as twenty-year-old cabdriver Ed Kennedy, as I lied to every single reporter about my age. When you lie once, you have to make it uniform. We all know that.  
  
¬† My bewildered face is plastered all over the front pages, and even a guy from a radio show shows up and tapes a conversation with me in my lounge room. I have coffee with him, but we have to drink it without milk. He'd stopped me on my way out to get some.  
  
¬† It's a Tuesday evening when I get home from work and pull the mail out of the letter box. As well as my electricity and gas bills and some junk mail, there's a small envelope. I throw it down on the table with everything else and forget about it. My name's written in scrawl, and I wonder what it could possibly be. Even when I'm making my steak-and-salad sandwich, I tell myself to go into the lounge room soon to open it. Constantly, I forget.  
  
¬† It's fairly late when I finally get around to it.  
  
¬† I feel it.  
  
¬† Feel something.  
  
¬† There's something flowing between my fingers as I hold the envelope in my hands and begin tearing it open. Th  
e night's a cool one, typical of spring.  
  
¬† I shiver.  
  
¬† I see my reflection in the TV screen and in the photo of my family.  
  
¬† The Doorman snores.  
  
¬† The breeze outside steps closer.  
  
¬† The fridge buzzes.  
  
¬† For a moment, it feels like everything stops to watch as I reach in and pull out an old playing card.  
  
¬† It's the Ace of Diamonds.  
  
¬† In the echoes of light in my lounge room, I let my fingers hold the card gently, as if it might break or crease in my hands. Three addresses are written on it in the same writing as on the envelope. I read them slowly, watchfully. There's an eeriness slipping over my hands. It makes its way inside me and travels, quietly gnawing at my thoughts. I read:  
  
¬† 45 Edgar Street, midnight  
  
¬† 13 Harrison Avenue, 6 p.m.  
  
¬† 6 Macedoni Street, 5:30 a.m.  
  
¬† I open the curtain to look outside.  
  
¬† Nothing.  
  
¬† I get past the Doorman and stand on the front porch.  
  
¬† ""Hello?"" I call out.  
  
¬† But again, there's nothing.  
  
¬† The breeze looks away--almost embarrassed at having watched--and I'm left there, standing. Alone. The card's still in my hand. I don't know the addresses I hold, or at least not exactly. I know the roads but not the actual houses.  
  
¬† It's without doubt the strangest thing that's ever happened to me.  
  
¬† Who would send me something like this? I ask myself. What have I done to get an old playing card in my letter box with strange addresses scrawled on it? I go back in and sit at the kitchen table. I try to work out what's happening and who has sent me what could be a piece of destiny in the mail. The visions of many faces reach me.  
  
¬† Could it be Audrey? I ask. Marv? Ritchie? Ma? I have no idea.  
  
¬† There's something in me that advises me to throw it out--to throw it in the bin and forget about it. Yet, I also feel pangs of guilt even for thinking of discarding it like that.  
  
¬† Maybe it's meant to be, I think.  
  
¬† The Doorman wanders over and sniffs the card.  
  
¬† Damn it, I can see him thinking. I thought it might be something to eat. After sniffing one last time, he pauses a moment and reflects on what he'd like to do next. As always, he shuffles back to the door, turns half a circle, and lies down. He gets comfortable in his suit of black and gold fur. His big eyes glow, but they also fall deep with darkness. His paws stretch out on the crusty old carpet.

I‚Äôm 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Here's my shot at an intro. üôÇ

Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back to my other love, history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive.

The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after ‚Äî all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.

Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through,.

The messages I get are disturbing. Some just
contain üçÜS, some are very racist. Like looking for a submissive bottom to breed. Or they ""promise"" to
destroy my holes... Is this how dating is today? It really depresses me, that no one just asks for a coffee. I'd even PAY to have a lovely evening. Like no
behind thoughts. Just having a chat and see where It goes from there? I always see gay couples online
and new couples jumping out from no wherein real liefe, while I'm baffled how and where they meet each other...
I am wondering if I am too old for dating and just
accept to be alone for the rest of my life? Yeah, I'm certain to some this may sound dramatic, but I do
not meet eligible partners at work and my circle of friends are gay free... Are my standards too high? I

We‚Äôve been together for about a year and we‚Äôre in the same class. At the beginning, everything felt really close and exciting, but now I just feel tired, anxious, and like I can‚Äôt really be myself around him.

Here are some things that happen:
	‚Ä¢	When I‚Äôm at his house, he plays video games for hours and I fall asleep waiting for him. Then, instead of spending time with me, he goes out with his friends without telling me. When I wake up and ask where he is, he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back soon,‚Äù but then stays out for two more hours.
	‚Ä¢	When I tell him something is bothering me, he always says ‚ÄúOkay, sorry, it‚Äôs my fault,‚Äù but then nothing changes. It feels like he says it just to end the conversation.
	‚Ä¢	We usually say ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù to each other every day. One day he didn‚Äôt, and only sent me a picture of a paper he wanted me to send for him. I told him that it hurt me, and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm tired of everything.‚Äù I asked if he was tired of me too, and he said yes.
	‚Ä¢	One time I told him I was home when I was still outside, and he made me send a photo to prove I was home. When I go out, he makes me send pictures every 10 minutes of where I am and who I‚Äôm with. He doesn‚Äôt let me go to clubs.
	‚Ä¢	He has the password to my phone and checks it often, especially if we haven‚Äôt seen each other for a few days.
	‚Ä¢	He doesn‚Äôt let me talk to any boys (except classmates), and he talks badly about my girlfriends when I open up to them.
	‚Ä¢	When I try to talk about how I feel, he turns it around and acts like he‚Äôs the victim ‚Äî like he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs always getting hurt and has to say sorry.

I feel like I have to be really careful about everything I say and do, or we‚Äôll end up in a fight. I‚Äôm scared to make a mistake or upset him.

My friends are shocked when I tell them what‚Äôs been happening. They don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm still with him. And the truth is ‚Äî I really love him. I also love his family a lot, and we‚Äôre very close, which makes everything even harder.

Also, about 6 months ago, I found out that he went out for coffee with his ex-girlfriend and his friend‚Äôs niece.

But the actual cafe experience seems lacking so far. I've been in twice now, and both times just ordered one of their basic varieties of coffee, and both times had to wait 15-20 minutes. There were other patrons, but it wasn't super busy either time, so I'm not sure why the long wait. So far its def not somewhere you can pop in and grab a quick drink to go if you're in a hurry.

The actual drink quality hasn't been great either so far. The spices have been overtuned - I love the variety of flavors, but when there's so much cardamom dumped in that the flavor becomes overpowering and there's a lump of undissolved particles in the cup that spoils the end of the drink, it really sours the experience.

First up was the Dam Good Decaf. I preheated the pan to just before smoking and threw in 8oz of beans. Didn't actually time it but it was about 10 minutes until I started hearing some cracking. Beans were starting to get pretty dark to I took them off maybe 2 minutes later and cooled them down in a metal bowl in the freezer.

Tried them an hour later and they have a super grassy smell and flavour. Definitely need to roast them longer next time and a smaller batch.

Later in the day roasted some Guatamalan beans. Only roasted 4oz this time, had the pan a little cooler and the heat a little lower. Was maybe 15 minutes to first crack and about 22 minutes total. Cooled them off in a baking sheet from the freezer and tried them this morning. I need to grind way finer for my morning long black, but they actually taste like coffee! Excited to see how it changes over the next few days.

Decaf still tastes grassy, more like a tea than a coffee... not undrinkable... but not coffee. Might have to gift them to a tea lover!

McManus,"¬† I fall asleep shortly after we hit the highway and don‚Äôt stir until a loud noise jolts me awake. It sounds as though the car is being pelted from every direction with dozens of rocks. I turn toward Ezra, disoriented, but he looks equally confused. Nana twists in her seat, shouting to be heard over the roar. ‚ÄúHail. Not uncommon this time of year. Although these are rather large.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to pull over and let this pass,‚Äù Melanie calls. She eases the car to the side of the road and shifts into park. The hail is hitting harder than ever, and I can‚Äôt help but think that she‚Äôs going to have hundreds of tiny dents in her car by the time it stops. One particularly large hailstone smacks right into the middle of the windshield, startling us all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow is it hailing?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúIt was hot in Burlington.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHail forms in the cloud layer,‚Äù Nana explains, gesturing toward the sky. ‚ÄúTemperatures are freezing there. The stones will melt quickly on the ground, though.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her voice isn‚Äôt warm, exactly‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure warmth is possible for her‚Äîbut it‚Äôs more animated than it‚Äôs been all night. Nana used to be a teacher, and she‚Äôs obviously a lot more comfortable in that role than that of Custodial Grandparent. Not that I blame her. She‚Äôs stuck with us during Sadie‚Äôs sixteen weeks of court-ordered rehab, and vice versa. The judge insisted we live with family, which severely limited our options. Our father was a one-night stand‚Äîa stuntman, or so he claimed during the whopping two hours he and Sadie spent together after meeting at an LA club. We don‚Äôt have aunts, uncles, or cousins. Not a single person, except for Nana, to take us in.  
  
¬† We sit in silence for a few minutes, watching hailstones bounce off the car hood, until the frequency tapers and finally stops altogether. Melanie pulls back onto the road, and I glance at the clock on the dashboard. It‚Äôs nearly eleven; I slept for almost an hour. I nudge Ezra and ask, ‚ÄúWe must almost be there, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlmost,‚Äù Ezra says. He lowers his voice. ‚ÄúPlace is hopping on a Friday night. We haven‚Äôt passed a building for miles.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs pitch black outside, and even after rubbing my eyes a few times I can‚Äôt see much out the window except the shadowy blur of trees. I try, though, because I want to see the place Sadie couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like living in a postcard,‚Äù she used to say. ‚ÄúPretty, shiny, and closed in. Everyone who lives  
in Echo Ridge acts like you‚Äôll vanish if you venture outside the border.‚Äù  
  
¬† The car goes over a bump, and my seat belt digs into my neck as the impact jolts me to one side. Ezra yawns so hard that his jaw cracks. I‚Äôm sure that once I crashed he felt obligated to stay awake and make conversation, even though neither of us has slept properly for days.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre less than a mile from home.‚Äù Nana‚Äôs voice from the front seat startles us both. ‚ÄúWe just passed the ‚ÄòWelcome to Echo Ridge‚Äô sign, although it‚Äôs so poorly lit that I don‚Äôt suppose you even noticed.‚Äù  
  
¬† She‚Äôs right. I didn‚Äôt, though I‚Äôd made a mental note to look for it. The sign was one of the few things Sadie ever talked about related to Echo Ridge, usually after a few glasses of wine. ‚Äú‚Äâ‚ÄòPopulation 4,935.‚Äô Never changed the entire eighteen years I lived there,‚Äù she‚Äôd say with a smirk. ‚ÄúApparently if you‚Äôre going to bring someone in, you have to take someone out first.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere comes the overpass, Melanie.‚Äù Nana‚Äôs voice has a warning edge.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Melanie says. The road curves sharply as we pass beneath an arch of gray stone, and Melanie slows to a crawl. There are no streetlights along this stretch, and Melanie switches on the high beams.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNana is the worst backseat driver ever,‚Äù Ezra whispers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I whisper back. ‚ÄúBut Melanie‚Äôs so careful.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUnless we‚Äôre at a red light, we‚Äôre going too fast.‚Äù  
  
¬† I snicker, just as my grandmother hollers, ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù in such a commanding voice that both Ezra and I jump. For a split second, I think she has supersonic hearing and is annoyed at our snarking. Then Melanie slams on the brakes, stopping the car so abruptly that I‚Äôm pitched forward against my seat belt.  
What the‚Äî?‚Äù Ezra and I both ask at the same time, but Melanie and Nana have already unbuckled and scrambled out of the car. We exchange confused glances and follow suit. The ground is covered with puddles of half-melted hail, and I pick my way around them toward my grandmother. Nana is standing in front of Melanie‚Äôs car, her gaze fixed on the patch of road bathed in bright headlights.  
  
¬† And on the still figure lying right in the middle of it. Covered in blood, with his neck bent at a horribly wrong angle and his eyes wide open, staring at nothing.  
  
¬† ELLERY  
  
¬† SATURDAY, AUGUST 31  
  
¬† The sun wakes me up, burning through blinds that clearly weren‚Äôt purchased for their room-darkening properties. But I stay immobile under the covers‚Äîa thin crocheted bedspread and petal-soft sheets‚Äîuntil a low knock sounds on the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I sit up, futilely trying to push hair out of my eyes, as Ezra enters. The silver-plated clock on the nightstand reads 9:50, but since I‚Äôm still on West Coast time I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôve slept nearly enough.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Ezra says. ‚ÄúNana said to wake you up. A police officer is on his way over. He wants to talk to us about last night.‚Äù  
  
¬† Last night. We stayed with the man in the road, crouching next to him between dark pools of blood, until an ambulance came. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look at his face at first, but once I did I couldn‚Äôt look away. He was so young. No older than thirty, dressed in athletic clothes and sneakers. Melanie, who‚Äôs a nurse, performed CPR until the EMTs arrived, but more like she was praying for a miracle than because she thought it would do any good. She told us when we got back into Nana‚Äôs car that he was dead before we arrived.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJason Bowman,‚Äù she‚Äôd said in a shaking voice. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Äîhe was‚Äîone of the science teachers at Echo Ridge High. Helped out with marching band, too. Really popular with the kids. You would have‚Ä¶you should have‚Ä¶met him next week.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ezra, who‚Äôs fully dressed, hair damp from a recent shower, tosses a small plastic pack onto the bed, bringing me back to the present. ‚ÄúAlso, she said to give you these.‚Äù  
  
¬† The unopened package has the Hanes logo on the front, along with a picture of a smiling blond woman wearing a sports bra and underpants that come halfway up her waist. ‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh yes. Those are literally granny panties. Nana says she bought a couple sizes too small by mistake and forgot to return them. Now they‚Äôre yours.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFantastic,‚Äù I mutter, swinging my legs out of bed. I‚Äôm wearing the T-shirt I had layered under my sweater yesterday, plus a rolled-up pair of Ezra‚Äôs sweatpants. When I learned I‚Äôd be moving to Echo Ridge, I went through my entire closet and ruthlessly donated anything I hadn‚Äôt worn in the past few months. I pared my wardrobe down so much that everything, except for a few coats and shoes that I shipped last week, fit into a single suitcase. At the time, it felt like I was bringing order and control to at least one small part of my life.  
  
¬† Now, of course, all it means is that I have nothing to wear.  
  
¬† I pick my phone up from the nightstand, checking for a luggage-related text or voice mail. But there‚Äôs nothing. ‚ÄúWhy are you up so early?‚Äù I ask Ezra.  
  
¬† He shrugs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that early. I‚Äôve been walking around the neighborhood. It‚Äôs pretty. Very leafy. I posted a couple of Insta stories. And made a playlist.‚Äù  
  
¬† I fold my arms. ‚ÄúNot another Michael playlist.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ezra says defensively. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a musical tribute to the Northeast. You‚Äôd be surprised how many songs have a New England state in the title.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMm-hmm.‚Äù Ezra‚Äôs boyfriend, Michael, broke up with him preemptively the week before we left because, he said, ‚Äúlong-distance relationships don‚Äôt ever work.‚Äù Ezra tries to act like he doesn‚Äôt care, but he‚Äôs created some seriously emo playlists since it happened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt judge.‚Äù Ezra‚Äôs eyes drift toward the bookcase, where In Cold Blood is lined up neatly next to my Ann Rule collection, Fatal Vision, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and the rest of my true-crime books. They‚Äôre the only things I unpacked last night from the boxes stacked in one corner of the room. ‚ÄúWe all have our coping mechanisms.‚Äù  
  
¬† He retreats to his room, and I gaze around the unfamiliar space I‚Äôll be living in for the next four months. When we arrived last night, Nana told me that I‚Äôd be sleeping in Sadie‚Äôs old room. I was both eager and nervous opening the door, wondering what echoes of my mother I‚Äôd find inside. But I walked into a standard guest bedroom without a scrap of personality. The furniture is dark wood, the walls a pale eggshell. There‚Äôs not much in the way of decor except for lacy curtains, a plaid area rug, and a framed print of a lighthouse. Everything smells faintly of lemon Pledge and cedar. When I try to imagine Sadie here‚Äîfixing her hair in the cloudy mirror over the dresser or doing her homework at the old-fashioned desk‚Äîthe images won‚Äôt come.  
  
¬† Ezra‚Äôs room is the same. There‚Äôs no hint that a teenage girl ever lived in either of them.  
  
¬† I drop to the floor beside my moving boxes and root around in the nearest one until I come across plastic-wrapped picture frames. The first one I unwrap is a photo of Ezra and me standing on Santa Monica Pier last year, a perfect sunset behind us. The setting is gorgeous, but it‚Äôs not a flattering picture of me. I wasn‚Äôt ready for the shot, and my tense expression doesn‚Äôt match Ezra‚Äôs wide grin. I kept it, though, because it reminded me of another photo.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs the second one I pull out‚Äîgrainy and much older, of two identical teenage girls with long, curly hair like mine, dressed in ‚Äô90s grungewear. One of them is smiling brightly, the other looks annoyed. My mother and her twin sister, Sarah. They were seventeen then, seniors at Echo Ridge High like Ezra and I are about to be. A few weeks after the photo was taken, Sarah disappeared.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs been twenty-three years and no one knows what happened to her. Or maybe it‚Äôd be more accurate to say that if anybody does know, they‚Äôre not telling.  
  
¬† I place the photos side by side on top of the bookcase, and think about Ezra‚Äôs words in the airport last night, after Andy overshared his origin story. What a weird thing to grow up with, though, huh? Knowing how easily you could‚Äôve been the wrong twin.  
  
¬† Sadie never liked talking about Sarah, no matter how hungry I was for information. There weren‚Äôt any pictures of her around our apartment; I had to steal this one off the Internet. My true-crime kick started in earnest with Lacey‚Äôs death, but ever since I was old enough to understand what happened to Sarah, I was obsessed with her disappearance. It was the worst thing I could imagine, to have your twin go missing and never come back.  
  
¬† Sadie‚Äôs smile in the photo is as blinding as Ezra‚Äôs. She was a star back then‚Äîthe popular homecoming queen, just like Lacey. And she‚Äôs been trying to be a star ever since. I don‚Äôt know if Sadie would have done better than a handful of walk-on roles if she‚Äôd had her twin cheering her on. I do know there‚Äôs no possible way she can feel complete. When you come into the world with another person, they‚Äôre as much a part of you as your heartbeat.  
  
¬† There are lots of reasons my mother got addicted to painkillers‚Äîa strained shoulder, a bad breakup, another lost role, moving to our crappiest apartment yet on her fortieth birthday‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt help but think it all started with the loss of that serious-faced girl in the photo.  
  
¬† The doorbell rings, and I almost drop the picture. I completely forgot I was supposed to be getting ready to meet a police officer. I glance at the mirror over the dresser, wincing at my reflection. My hair looks like a wig, and all my anti-frizz products are in my missing suitcase. I pull my curls into a ponytail, then twist and turn the thick strands until I can knot the ends together into a low bun without needing an elastic. It‚Äôs one of the first hair tricks Sadie ever taught me. When I was little we‚Äôd stand at the double sink in our bathroom, me watching her in the mirror so I could copy the quick, deft motion of her hands.  
  
¬† My eyes prick as Nana calls up the stairs. ‚ÄúEllery?  
Ezra? Officer Rodriguez is here.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ezra‚Äôs already in the hall when I leave my room, and we head downstairs to Nana‚Äôs kitchen. A dark-haired man in a blue uniform, his back to us, takes the cup of coffee Nana holds toward him. She looks like she just stepped out of an L. L. Bean catalog in khakis, clogs and a boxy oxford shirt with horizontal stripes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe the town will finally do something about that overpass,‚Äù Nana says, then catches my eye over the officer‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúThere you are. Ryan, this is my granddaughter and grandson. Ellery and Ezra, meet Officer Ryan Rodriguez. He lives down the street and came by to ask us a few questions about last night.‚Äù  
  
¬† The officer turns with a half smile that freezes as the coffee mug slips out of his hand and goes crashing to the floor. None of us react for a second, and then everybody leaps into action at once, grabbing at paper towels and picking thick pieces of ceramic mug off Nana‚Äôs black-and-white tiled floor.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Officer Rodriguez keeps repeating. He can‚Äôt be more than five years older than me and Ezra, and he looks as though even he‚Äôs not sure whether he‚Äôs an actual adult yet. ‚ÄúI have no idea how that happened. I‚Äôll replace the mug.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, for goodness‚Äô sake,‚Äù Nana says crisply. ‚ÄúThose cost two dollars at Dalton‚Äôs. Sit down and I‚Äôll get you another one. You too, kids. There‚Äôs juice on the table if you want some.‚Äù  
  
¬† We all settle around the kitchen table, which is neatly set with three place mats, silverware, and glasses. Officer Rodriguez pulls a notepad from his front pocket and flips through it with a knitted brow. He has one of those hangdog faces that looks worried even now, when he‚Äôs not breaking my grandmother‚Äôs stuff. ‚ÄúThanks for making time this morning. I just came from the Kilduffs‚Äô house, and Melanie filled me in on what happened at the Fulkerson Street overpass last night. Which, I‚Äôm sorry to say, looks like it was a hit-and-run.‚Äù Nana hands him another cup of coffee before sitting down next to Ezra, and Officer Rodriguez takes a careful sip. ‚ÄúThank you, Mrs. Corcoran. So it would be helpful if all of you could tell me everything you observed, even if it doesn‚Äôt seem important.‚Äù  
  
¬† I straighten in my chair, and Ezra rolls his eyes. He knows exactly what‚Äôs going through my head. Even though last night was awful, I can‚Äôt not feel a slight thrill at being part of an actual police investigation. I‚Äôve been waiting for this moment half my life.  
  
¬† Unfortunately I‚Äôm no help, because I hardly remember anything except Melanie trying to help Mr. Bowman. Ezra‚Äôs not much better. Nana is the only one who noticed little details, like the fact that there was an umbrella and a Tupperware container scattered on the street next to Mr. Bowman. And as far as investigating officers go, Ryan Rodriguez is disappointing. He keeps repeating the same questions, almost knocks over his fresh cup of coffee, and stumbles constantly over Melanie‚Äôs name. By the time he thanks us and Nana walks him to the front door, I‚Äôm convinced he needs a few more years of training before they let him out on his own again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was kind of disorganized,‚Äù I say when Nana returns to the kitchen. ‚ÄúDo people take him seriously as a police officer around here?‚Äù  
  
¬† She takes a pan out from a cabinet next to the stove and places it on a front burner. ‚ÄúRyan is perfectly capable,‚Äù she says matter-of-factly, crossing to the refrigerator and pulling out the butter dish. She sets it on the counter and slices off a huge chunk, dropping it into the pan. ‚ÄúHe may be a little out of sorts. His father died a few months ago. Cancer. They were very close. And his mother passed the year before, so it‚Äôs been one thing after another for that family. Ryan is the youngest and the only one still at home. I imagine it‚Äôs been lonely.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe lived with his parents?‚Äù Ezra asks. ‚ÄúHow old is he?‚Äù My brother is kind of judgy about adults who still live at home. He‚Äôll be one of those people, like Sadie, who moves out as soon as the ink is dry on his diploma. He has a ten-year plan that involves taking a grunt job at a radio station while deejaying on the side, until he has enough experience to host his own show. I try not to panic whenever I imagine him leaving me behind to do‚Ä¶who even knows what.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwenty-two, I think? Or twenty-three,‚Äù Nana says. ‚ÄúAll the Rodriguez kids lived at home during college. Ryan stayed once his father got sick.‚Äù Ezra hunches his shoulders guiltily as my ears prick up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwenty-three?‚Äù I repeat. ‚ÄúWas he in Lacey Kilduff‚Äôs class?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI believe so,‚Äù Nana says as she cracks an egg into the now-sizzling pan.  
  
¬† I hesitate. I barely know my grandmother. We‚Äôve never talked about my missing aunt on our awkward, infrequent Skype calls, and I have no idea if Lacey‚Äôs death is extra-painful for her because of what happened to Sarah. I should probably keep my mouth shut, but‚Ä¶  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWere they friends?‚Äù I blurt out. Ezra‚Äôs face settles into a here we go expression.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt say. They knew one another, certainly. Ryan grew up in the neighborhood and they both worked at‚Ä¶Fright Farm.‚Äù Her hesitation before the new name is so slight that I almost miss it. ‚ÄúMost kids in town did. Still do.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen does it open?‚Äù Ezra asks. He glances at me like he‚Äôs doing me a favor, but he didn‚Äôt have to bother. I looked up the schedule as soon as I learned we were moving to Echo Ridge.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNext weekend. Right before you two start school,‚Äù Nana says. Echo Ridge has the latest start date of any school we‚Äôve ever attended, which is one point in its favor. At La Puente, we‚Äôd already been in school two weeks by Labor Day. Nana gestures with her spatula toward the kitchen window over the sink, which looks out into the woods behind her house. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear it once it does. It‚Äôs a ten-minute walk through the woods.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is?‚Äù Ezra looks baffled. I am too, but mostly by his utter lack of research. ‚ÄúSo the Kilduffs still live right behind the place where their daughter‚Ä¶where somebody, um‚Ä¶‚Äù He trails off as Nana turns toward us with two plates, each holding an enormous fluffy omelet, and deposits them in front of us. Ezra and I exchange surprised glances. I can‚Äôt remember the last time either of us had anything for breakfast other than coffee. But my mouth waters at the savory scent, and my stomach rumbles. I haven‚Äôt eaten anything since the three Kind bars I had for dinner on last night‚Äôs flight.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell.‚Äù Nana sits down between us and pours herself a glass of orange juice from the ceramic pitcher on the table. Pitcher. Not a carton. I spend a few seconds trying to figure out why you‚Äôd bother emptying a carton into a pitcher before taking a sip of mine and realizing it‚Äôs freshly squeezed. How are she and Sadie even related? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs their home. The two younger girls have lots of friends in the neighborhood.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow old are they?‚Äù I ask. Melanie wasn‚Äôt just Sadie‚Äôs favorite babysitter; she was almost a mentor to her in high school‚Äîand pretty much the only person from Echo Ridge my mother ever talked about. But I still know hardly anything about her except that her daughter was murdered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCaroline is twelve and Julia is six,‚Äù Nana says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs quite a gap between the two of them, and between Lacey and Caroline. Melanie‚Äôs always had trouble conceiving. But there‚Äôs a silver lining, I suppose. The girls were so young when Lacey died, looking after them might be the only thing that kept Melanie and Dan going during such a terrible time.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ezra cuts into the corner of his omelet and releases a small cloud of steam. ‚ÄúThe police never had any suspects in Lacey‚Äôs murder, huh?‚Äù he asks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Nana says at the same time as I say, ‚ÄúThe boyfriend.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nana takes a long sip of juice. ‚ÄúPlenty of people thought that. Think that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut Declan Kelly wasn‚Äôt an official suspect. Questioned, yes. Multiple times. But never held.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoes he still live in Echo Ridge?‚Äù I ask.  
  
¬† She shakes her head. ‚ÄúHe left town right after graduation. Best for all involved, I‚Äôm sure. The situation took an enormous toll on his family. Declan‚Äôs father moved away shortly after he did. I thought the mother and brother would be next, bu  
t‚Ä¶things worked out differently for them.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pause with my fork in midair. ‚ÄúBrother?‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt known Lacey‚Äôs boyfriend had a brother; the news never reported much about his family.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDeclan has a younger brother, Malcolm. Around your age,‚Äù Nana says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know him well, but he seems a quieter sort. Doesn‚Äôt strut around town as if he owns it, at any rate, the way his brother did.‚Äù  
  
¬† I watch her take a careful bite of omelet, wishing I could read her better so I‚Äôd know whether Lacey and Sarah are as intertwined in her mind as they are in mine. It‚Äôs been so long since Sarah disappeared; almost a quarter century with no answers. Lacey‚Äôs parents lack a different kind of closure‚Äîthey know what, when, and how, but not who or why. ‚ÄúDo you think Declan Kelly is guilty?‚Äù I ask.  
  
¬† Nana‚Äôs brow wrinkles, as though she suddenly finds the entire conversation distasteful. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that. There was never any hard evidence against him.‚Äù  
  
¬† I reach for the saltshaker without responding. That might be true, but if years of reading true-crime books and watching Dateline have taught me anything, it‚Äôs this: it‚Äôs always the boyfriend.  
  
¬† MALCOLM  
  
¬† WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4  
  
¬† My shirt‚Äôs stiff with too much starch. It practically crackles when I bend my arms to drape a tie around my neck. I watch my hands in the mirror, trying and failing to get the knot straight, and give up when it‚Äôs at least the right size. The mirror looks old and expensive, like everything in the Nilssons‚Äô house. It reflects a bedroom that could fit three of my old one. And at least half of Declan‚Äôs apartment.  
  
¬† What‚Äôs it like living in that house? my brother asked last night, scraping the last of his birthday cake off a plate while Mom was in the bathroom. She‚Äôd brought a bunch of balloons that looked tiny in the Nilssons‚Äô foyer, but kept batting Declan in the head in the cramped alcove he calls a kitchen.Fucked up, I said. Which is true. But no more fucked up than the past five years have been. Declan‚Äôs spent most of them living four hours away in New Hampshire, renting a basement apartment from our aunt.  
  
¬† A sharp knock sounds at my bedroom door, and hinges squeak as my stepsister pokes her head in without waiting for an answer. ‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù she asks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I say, picking up a blue suit coat from my bed and shrugging it on. Katrin tilts her head and frowns, ice-blond hair spilling over one shoulder. I know that look: There‚Äôs something wrong with you, and I‚Äôm about to tell you exactly what it is and how to fix it. I‚Äôve been seeing it for months now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour tie‚Äôs crooked,‚Äù she says, heels clicking on the floor as she walks toward me, hands outstretched. A crease appears between her eyes as she tugs at the knot, then disappears when she steps back to view her work. ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she says, patting my shoulder with a satisfied expression. ‚ÄúMuch better.‚Äù Her hand skims down to my chest and she plucks a piece of lint from my suit coat with two pale-pink fingernails and lets it drop to the floor. ‚ÄúYou clean up all right, Mal. Who would‚Äôve thought?‚Äù  
  
¬† Not her. Katrin Nilsson barely spoke to me until her father started dating my mother last winter. She‚Äôs the queen of Echo Ridge High, and I‚Äôm the band nerd with the disreputable family. But now that we live under the same roof, Katrin has to acknowledge my existence. She copes by treating me like either a project or a nuisance, depending on her mood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù she says, tugging lightly at my arm. Her black dress hugs her curves but stops right above her knees. She‚Äôd almost be conservative if she weren‚Äôt wearing tall, spiky heels that basically force you to look at her legs. So I do. My new stepsister might be a pain in the ass, but she‚Äôs undeniably hot.  
  
¬† I follow Katrin into the hallway to the balcony staircase overlooking the massive foyer downstairs. My mother and Peter are at the bottom waiting for us, and I drop my eyes because whenever they‚Äôre standing that close, his hands are usually someplace I don‚Äôt want to see. Katrin and her superjock boyfriend commit less PDA than those two.  
  
¬† But Mom‚Äôs happy, and I guess that‚Äôs good.  
  
¬† Peter looks up and takes a break from manhandling my mom. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you two look nice!‚Äù he calls out. He‚Äôs in a suit too, same dark blue as mine, except he gets his tailored so they fit him perfectly. Peter‚Äôs like one of those suave GQ watch ads come to life‚Äîsquare jaw, penetrating gaze, wavy blond hair with just enough gray to be distinguished. Nobody could believe he was interested in my mother when they first started dating. People were even more shocked when he married her.  
  
¬† He saved them. That‚Äôs what the entire town thinks. Peter Nilsson, the rich and charming owner of the only law firm in town, took us from town pariahs to town royalty with one tasteful justice of the peace ceremony at Echo Ridge Lake. And maybe he did. People don‚Äôt avoid my mother anymore, or whisper behind her back. She gets invited to the garden club, school committees, tonight‚Äôs fund-raiser, and all that other crap.  
  
¬† Doesn‚Äôt mean I have to like him, though.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice having you back, Malcolm,‚Äù he adds, almost sounding like he means it. Mom and I have been gone a week, visiting family across a few towns in New Hampshire and then finishing up at Declan‚Äôs place. Peter and Katrin didn‚Äôt come. Partly because he had to work, and partly because neither of them leave Echo Ridge for anyplace without room service and a spa.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you have dinner with Mr. Coates while we were gone?‚Äù I ask abruptly.  
  
¬† Peter‚Äôs nostrils flare slightly, which is the only sign of annoyance he ever shows. ‚ÄúI did, on Friday. He‚Äôs still getting his business up and running, but when the time is right he‚Äôd be happy to talk with Declan. I‚Äôll keep checking in with him.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ben Coates used to be mayor of Echo Ridge. After that, he left to run a political consulting business in Burlington. Declan is a few‚Äîokay, a lot‚Äîof credits short from finishing his poli-sci degree at community college, but he‚Äôs still hoping for a recommendation. It‚Äôs the only thing he‚Äôs ever asked of Peter. Or of Mom, I guess, since Declan and Peter don‚Äôt really talk.  
  
¬† Mom beams at Peter, and I let it drop. Katrin steps forward, reaching out a hand to touch the twisted beaded necklace Mom‚Äôs wearing. ‚ÄúThis is so pretty!‚Äù she exclaims. ‚ÄúVery bohemian. Such a nice change from all the pearls we‚Äôll see tonight.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom‚Äôs smile fades. ‚ÄúI have pearls,‚Äù she says nervously, looking at Peter. ‚ÄúShould I‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine,‚Äù he says quickly. ‚ÄúYou look beautiful.‚Äù  
  
¬† I could kill Katrin. Not literally. I feel like I have to add that disclaimer even in my own thoughts, given our family history. But I don‚Äôt understand her constant need to make digs at Mom‚Äôs expense. It‚Äôs not like Mom broke up Katrin‚Äôs parents; she‚Äôs Peter‚Äôs third wife. Katrin‚Äôs mother was long gone to Paris with a new husband before Mom and Peter even went on their first date.  
  
¬† And Katrin has to know that Mom is nervous about tonight. We‚Äôve never been to the Lacey Kilduff Memorial Scholarship fund-raiser before. Mostly because we‚Äôve never been invited.  
  
¬† Or welcome.  
  
¬† Peter‚Äôs nostrils flare again. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs head out, shall we? It‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù  
  
¬† He opens the front door, stepping aside to let us through while pressing a button on his key chain. His black Range Rover starts idling in the driveway, and Katrin and I climb into the back. My mother settles herself in the passenger seat and flips the radio from the Top 40 station that Katrin likes to blast to NPR. Peter gets in last, buckling his seat belt before shifting the car into gear.  
  
¬† The Nilssons‚Äô winding driveway is the longest part of the trip. After that, it‚Äôs a few quick turns and we‚Äôre in downtown Echo Ridge. So to speak. There‚Äôs not much to it‚Äîa row of white-trimmed redbrick buildings on either side of Manchester Street, lined with old-fashioned, wrought iron streetlights. It‚Äôs never crowded here, but it‚Äôs especially dead on a Wednesday night before school‚Äôs back in session. Half the town is still on vacation, and the other half is attending the fund-raiser in the Echo Ridge Cultural Center. That‚Äôs where anything notable at Echo Ridge happens, unless it happens at the Nilssons‚Äô house.  
  
¬† Our house. Can‚Äôt get used to that.  
  
¬† Peter parallel parks on Manchester Street and we spill out of the car and onto the sidewalk. We‚Äôre right across the street from O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs Funeral Home, and Katrin heaves a sigh as we pass the pale-blue Victorian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too bad you were out of town for Mr. Bowman‚Äôs service,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt was really nice. The show choir sang ‚ÄòTo Sir with Love‚Äô and everybody lost it.‚Äù  
  
¬† My gut twists. Mr. Bowman was my favorite teacher at Echo Ridge High, by a lot. He had this quiet way of noticing what you were good at, and encouraging you to get better. After Declan moved away and my dad took off, when I had a lot of pissed-off energy and nowhere to put it, he was the one who suggested I take up the drums. It makes me sick that somebody mowed him down and left him to die in the middle of the road.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy was he even out in a hailstorm?‚Äù I ask, because it‚Äôs easier to fixate on that than to keep feeling like shit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey found a Tupperware container near him,‚Äù Peter says. ‚ÄúOne of the teachers at the funeral thought he might have been collecting hail for a lesson he was planning on climate change. But I guess we‚Äôll never know for sure.‚Äù  
  
¬† And now I feel worse, because I can picture it: Mr. Bowman leaving his house late at night with his umbrella and his plastic container, all enthusiastic because he was going to make science real. He said that kind of thing a lot.  
  
¬† After a couple of blocks, a gold-rimmed wooden sign welcomes us to the cultural center. It‚Äôs the most impressive of all the redbrick buildings, with a clock tower on top and wide steps leading to a carved wooden door. I reach for the door, but Peter‚Äôs faster. Always. You can‚Äôt out-gentleman that guy. Mom smiles gratefully at him as she steps through the entrance.  
  
¬† When we get inside, a woman dir  
ects us down a hallway to an open room that contains dozens of round tables. Some people are sitting down, but most of the crowd is still milling around and talking. A few turn toward us, and then, like human dominoes, they all do.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs the moment everyone in Echo Ridge has been waiting for: for the first time in five years, the Kellys have shown up at a night honoring Lacey Kilduff.  
  
¬† The girl who most people in town still believe my brother killed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs Theo,‚Äù Katrin murmurs, slipping away into the crowd toward her boyfriend. So much for solidarity. My mother licks her lips nervously. Peter folds her arm under his and pastes on a big, bright smile. For a second, I almost like the guy.  
  
¬† Declan and Lacey had been fighting for weeks before she died. Which wasn‚Äôt like them; Declan could be an arrogant ass a lot of the time, but not with his girlfriend. Then all of a sudden they were slamming doors, canceling dates, and sniping at each other over social media. Declan‚Äôs last, angry message on Lacey‚Äôs Instagram feed was the one that news stations showed over and over in the weeks after her body was found.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm so fucking done with you. DONE. You have no idea.  
  
¬† The crowd at the Echo Ridge Cultural Center is too quiet. Even Peter‚Äôs smile is getting a little fixed. The Nilsson armor is supposed to be more impenetrable than this. I‚Äôm about to say or do something desperate to cut the tension when a warm voice floats our way. ‚ÄúHello, Peter. And Alicia! Malcolm! It‚Äôs good to see you both.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs Lacey‚Äôs mom, Melanie Kilduff, coming toward us with a big smile. She hugs my mother first, then me, and when she pulls back nobody‚Äôs staring anymore.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I mutter. I don‚Äôt know what Melanie thinks about Declan; she‚Äôs never said. But after Lacey died, when it felt like the entire world hated my family, Melanie always made a point to be nice to us. Thanks doesn‚Äôt feel like enough, but Melanie brushes my arm like it‚Äôs too much before turning toward Mom and Peter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, have a seat wherever you‚Äôd like,‚Äù she says, gesturing toward the dining area. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre about to start serving dinner.‚Äù  
  
¬† She leaves us, heading for a table with her family, her neighbor, and a couple of kids my age I‚Äôve never seen before. Which is unusual enough in this town that I crane my neck for a better look. I can‚Äôt get a good glimpse of the guy, but the girl is hard to miss. She‚Äôs got wild curly hair that seems almost alive, and she‚Äôs wearing a weird flowered dress that looks like it came out of her grandmother‚Äôs closet. Maybe it‚Äôs retro, I don‚Äôt know. Katrin wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead in it. The girl meets my eyes, and I immediately look away. One thing I‚Äôve learned from being Declan‚Äôs brother over the past five years: nobody likes it when a Kelly boy stares.  
  
¬† Peter starts toward the front of the room, but Katrin returns just then and tugs on his arm. ‚ÄúCan we sit at Theo‚Äôs table, Dad? There‚Äôs plenty of space.‚Äù He hesitates‚ÄîPeter likes to lead, not follow‚Äîand Katrin puts on her most wheedling voice. ‚ÄúPlease? I haven‚Äôt seen him all week, and his parents want to talk to you about that stoplight ordinance thing.‚Äù  
  
¬† She‚Äôs good. There‚Äôs nothing Peter likes better than in-depth discussions about town council crap that would bore anybody else to tears. He smiles indulgently and changes course.  
  
¬† Katrin‚Äôs boyfriend, Theo, and his parents are the only people sitting at the ten-person table when we approach. I‚Äôve gone to school with Theo since kindergarten, but as usual he looks right through me as he waves to someone over my shoulder. ‚ÄúYo, Kyle! Over here.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh hell.  
  
¬† Theo‚Äôs best friend, Kyle, takes a seat between him and my mother, and the chair next to me scrapes as a big man with a graying blond buzz cut settles down beside me. Chad McNulty, Kyle‚Äôs father and the Echo Ridge police officer who investigated Lacey‚Äôs murder. Because this night wasn‚Äôt awkward enough already. My mother‚Äôs got that deer-in-the-headlights look she always gets around the McNultys, and Peter flares his nostrils at an oblivious Theo.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello, Malcolm.‚Äù Officer McNulty unfolds his napkin onto his lap without looking at me. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your summer been?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I manage, taking a long sip of water.  
  
¬† Officer McNulty never liked my brother. Declan dated his daughter, Liz, for three months and dumped her for Lacey, which got Liz so upset that she dropped out of school for a while. In return, Kyle‚Äôs always been a dick to me. Standard small-town crap that got a lot worse once Declan became an unofficial murder suspect.  
  
¬† Waiters start moving around the room, putting plates of salad in front of everyone. Melanie steps behind a podium on the stage in front, and Officer McNulty‚Äôs jaw tenses. ‚ÄúThat woman is a tower of strength,‚Äù he says, like he‚Äôs daring me to disagree.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you so much for coming,‚Äù Melanie says, leaning toward the microphone. ‚ÄúIt means the world to Dan, Caroline, Julia, and me to see how much the Lacey Kilduff Memorial Scholarship fund has grown.‚Äù  
  
¬† I tune the rest out. Not because I don‚Äôt care, but because it‚Äôs too hard to hear. Years of not being invited to these things means I haven‚Äôt built up much resistance. After Melanie finishes her speech, she introduces a University of Vermont junior who was the first scholarship recipient. The girl talks about her medical school plans as empty salad plates are replaced with the main course. When she‚Äôs done, everyone applauds and turns their attention to the food. I poke half-heartedly at my dry chicken while Peter holds court about stoplights. Is it too soon for a bathroom break?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe thing is, it‚Äôs a delicate balance between maintaining town aesthetics and accommodating changing traffic patterns,‚Äù Peter says earnestly.  
  
¬† Nope. Not too soon. I stand, drop my napkin onto my chair, and take off.  
  
¬† When I‚Äôve washed my hands as many times as I can stand, I exit the men‚Äôs room and hesitate in the corridor between the banquet hall and the front door. The thought of returning to that table makes my head pound. Nobody‚Äôs going to miss me for another few minutes.  
  
¬† I tug at my collar and push open the door, stepping outside into the darkness. It‚Äôs still muggy, but less stifling than inside. Nights like this make me feel like I can‚Äôt breathe, like everything my brother did, actual and alleged, settled over me when I was twelve years old and still weighs me down. I became Declan Kelly‚Äôs brother before I got a chance to be anything else, and sometimes it feels like that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll ever be.  
  
¬† I inhale deeply, and pause when a faint chemical smell hits me. It gets stronger as I descend the stairs and head toward the lawn. With my back to the lights I can‚Äôt see much, and almost trip over something lying in the grass. I bend down and pick it up. It‚Äôs a can of spray paint that‚Äôs missing its top.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm smelling: fresh paint. But where is it coming from? I turn back toward the cultural center. Its well-lit exterior looks the same as ever. There isn‚Äôt anything else nearby that might have been recently painted, except‚Ä¶  
  
¬† The cultural center sign is halfway across the lawn between the building and the street. I‚Äôm practically on top of it before I can see clearly in the dim glow thrown from the nearest streetlight. Red letters cover the back of the sign from top to bottom, stark against the pale wood:  
  
¬† MURDERLAND  
  
¬† THE SEQUEL  
  
¬† COMING SOON

My ex dumped me a year ago. I was heartbroken and at first, like most of you, just hoping and praying he would come back. He didn‚Äôt. In fact he met a girl and got into a relationship with her a month after. They‚Äôre still together. Here is what I have learned about myself and learned about the healing process 

- it will come in waves. Especially at first. The waves of sadness lasted about 4 months until it started to stabilize. Then it was every so often. Now it is never. 
- I have more of an avoidant personality than I previously realized. Just because you don‚Äôt rebound, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt avoid. I used alcohol and partying to distract myself after the breakup. It has not been until recently that I realized how much I have depended on alcohol this last year. 
- Just because you got dumped doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt end up being the one who wins. And it sure doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt worthy of love. Long story short my ex is losing friends currently due to the girl he is in a relationship with (we have mutual friends so I am kept up on the drama, though I would not recommend this). I would rather have been dumped and still have my friends than dump someone and lose friends over my new relationship. And even tho platonic and familial love do not take the place of romantic love, if you have people who love you outside of romance, that is the best evidence you can have that you are very much worthy of love. Which brings me to my next point. 
- Look for love everywhere. At your coffee shop, the bookstore, a restaurant, a bar. Look for people who love each other, openly and freely everywhere you go, not to remind you that it‚Äôs something you ‚Äòlost‚Äô but that it something that exists. Love is action and an emotion, which means it can wax and wane, which means it will come to you again, which most importantly means it is not something you can actually lose. 
- Something I have had to come to terms with, that will very much look different for everyone, is that not only could he not love me in the way I needed to be loved, but I could not love him in the way he needed to be loved. 
- Hindsight is 20/20. Let time pass, and as it does things will become clearer, and it will be easier to look back and understand what went wrong, and through reflection, you will find your closure. 
- I no longer have any desire for my ex. No desire to see or speak to him, certainly no desire to rekindle. I still think about him, of course. I still think about a lot of people from my past. But I promise you there will come a day that you look at your ex without rose colored glasses. The day that happens you will see that they were just a chapter in your book. That you wouldn‚Äôt want someone back who broke your heart. And most importantly that life does in fact go on, so long as you haven‚Äôt dug yourself into a hole of obsession and self pity. 

I wanted to revisit this sub and make this post because I know I could‚Äôve used something like this when I was first going through my breakup. I hope this helps and shines a light, even if it‚Äôs a very small dim one, at the end of a dark tunnel.

I wanted to build a nightstand out of Walnut, and realized I probably need a table saw to trim a wider all glued piece. I've been exploring my options, and it seems like DeWalt is a popular brand for compact, affordable jobsite saws. 

I've been looking at other threads, and it seems like the consensus is to go 10 inch. However, my budget does not allow for a 10 inch saw. The [DeWalt 10 Inch](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/dewalt-15-amp-corded-10-inch-portable-table-saw-with-rolling-stand/1000721938) saw is $1000 CAD, even more with sales tax. The smaller [DeWalt 8 1/4 inch](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/dewalt-15-amp-corded-8-1-4-in-compact-portable-jobsite-tablesaw-stand-not-included-/1001509951) saw is only $400, which is 60% cheaper than the the 10 inch. Is the 10 inch really worth it when making smaller furniture like a nightstand or coffee table?

The cheapest 10 inch saw that fits in my price range I could find is this [Craftsman](https://www.rona.ca/en/product/craftsman-10-in-carbide-tipped-blade-table-saw-cmxetax69434502-97925013). Is this okay for a beginner, or will it struggle to cut through harder wood?

I've looked on marketplace, and the only two listings near me that are appealing are priced way too high. 

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I took wood working class in high school, and am picking this up in University as a side hobby.

- Scheana: So this story is a chapter in my book. And the excerpt had released first in Glamour. That was only a short portion of it. I have been trying to stay out of the comment section, but I do still see the headlines. I do still have friends that send me stuff.
- Scheana: So I've seen some of it saying, I did this to sell books. I did this to get buzz. Someone told me that there's this whole, I don't know if it's on Reddit, a whole thing that says that we just made this up completely to sell books.
- Brock: That‚Äôs a, I wish. 
- Scheana: I'm trying to angle for a spot on The Valley, which I want to just point out here. I've said it in a couple of interviews this week. I was on The Valley before it existed.
- Scheana: Season eight of Vanderpump Rules was going to transition into what now is season 12 and what now is The Valley. So I was a part of the first season, the second season, but also still had Vanderpump Rules season 11 and we thought season 12. So this is not me trying to angle for a spot on a show that I already had a spot on.
- Scheana: I just want to point that out. It's also not because my hand was forced because parts of the story were published as a blind item by a gossip account. Honestly, I mean, I expected some of that feedback. I get it, but here's the truth. So this story isn't a stunt. It's not this thing to try and sell books, okay?
- Scheana: It is our real story, and unfortunately, it's one some of you listening might identify with. Sharing this story when and how I did was about agency. This excerpt with glamour published simultaneously when advanced copies of the book were being sent out in full.
- Scheana: Previous copies of the book that had went out had this chapter excluded. But that was the moment I finally felt safe enough to share it, and not because I wanted to be part of a headline. Trust me, I do not want a headline, a magazine cover with just the word cheating across my chest.
- Scheana: But it's because I wanted to own my own story before someone else told it for me. Copies of the book were going out. We had galleys going out.
- Scheana: We have people who need to read it, to review it and prepare for the podcast interviews they're doing with me. And at any point in time, someone could have leaked this. So this was the way that I wanted to do it.
- Scheana: And this wasn't a decision I made alone. It was something Brock and I talked through together. And, you know, it would have been seemingly easier to leave it out.
- Scheana: But we both knew that that would be dishonest. I think it would feel extremely inauthentic to have a literal chapter of my life missing as a chapter in this book. So, and, you know, there's also there's people out there who know about this.
- Scheana: There was someone else involved. And at any point, it could have been exposed by anyone completely out of our control. And I didn't want to live in that fear anymore.
- Scheana: I don't think Brock wanted to live in that. So we wanted to share this on our terms with our voice. And it's also important to say this.
- Scheana: I want to just say that when you're writing a memoir, it really has to be the whole story. You know, when we were going back and forth between, will this chapter be in, will it be out? Maybe the book will be OK without it.
- Scheana: And the book did sell with a very vague description of what this chapter could look like. But not putting it in the book, it felt like a piece of it was missing. And if I couldn't stand behind what I'd written and with full transparency, then like literally what's the point of writing a memoir at all?
- Scheana: I felt like it needed to be in because I would be doing a disservice to the readers and to myself to put out a piece of work that I'm not completely proud of that felt incomplete.

So we have talked about this so much. But for everyone listening, can you talk about the conversation we had when I told you I needed to include this in the book and why you ultimately supported that decision? (6:10)
- Brock: I mean, yeah, look, first off, I'm proud of you for telling your story. And I'm sorry for this being a part of your story. But I would like to be, you know, to be clear with this part, the leak didn't tell to create or tell the truth.
- Brock: It was just a means to speeding up the timeline of when we wanted to address this publicly. Now, and when you came to me about the book and we had a conversation about it, you know, at the end of the day, this was your story to tell. And yes, it involved, my actions became a part of it, but you have every right to tell your story, how you want to tell it.
- Brock: And if I was saying there was a version of me trying to minimize that and protect our relationship, I think it was just going back to that, you know, a trait that I had where I was just not willing to face the music.
- Brock: So when you told me about it, I said, you know, I support you. And then I will read it once you've written your book because I didn't want to have any influence on it.
- Brock: And so it's not about the book per se. I'd rather just talk about and take accountability for my actions that are in the book. And for us, we decided to do that head on.
- Brock: We didn't want to sit there and protect our relationship on that level, considering that we needed this to move on through our relationship, I think.
- Scheana: Yeah, I think too, what's been eye opening for me in all of this is kind of watching you just peel back the layers and really look at why you made the choices you did. I have spent a lot of time trying to understand, you know, how could the man I love do this to me? In my first marriage, it was an emotional affair. Now, in this marriage, it's a physical affair.

And I know we've talked about your past, the person you used to be, but for the listeners who are tuning in just today, say they've never heard your story before, can you explain to everyone who that man was? And I'm not saying this as an excuse by any means, but just to give more context into the why and the how. (8:02)
- Brock: Yeah, look, we're in a tough position here because this is not an excuse. It is exactly, I wanna give more context because through the learning and developing and working on myself, you'll call it, there's definitely a part of me that fundamentally is a core of me. 
- Brock: It's how I developed from my 20s, from my 30s, and it was from my youth. And without making it an excuse, in 12 years of education, I ended up going to 15 different schools.
- Scheana: So crazy.
- Brock: And from that constant instability, it really created this drive for achievement, this urge to kind of find my value in achieving things and things that I did. And I became super focused on that, and it created this egomaniac. I needed to find my value in my achievements.
- Brock: And I detached from a lot of my emotions easily. I minimized a lot of my destructive qualities and characters, my actions. And you know, I kind of just...
- Scheana: Did you just like not care about the consequences?
- Brock: Yeah, I just shrugged it off. I just, I just, that's a part of life. I used to, and looking back on that now, I can kind of understand where there's a serious problem there.
- Brock: And it wasn't until I was open to learning more about that, where I realized, okay, I am a part of this problem, you know, and I can change it. 
- Brock: Those skill sets in my twenties and thirties definitely served me in kind of getting to where I am from Ipswich, from this boy from New Zealand, from a dairy farm. But then going into this father role and husband role, those skill set that I developed do not serve me well at all.
- Scheana: When we first talked about this, I mean, not the night of, because there was a lot of anger that night. But after we started having more conversations and stuff about it. 
- Scheana: And something that I've been saying in interviews this week is and I talk about this in the book, but it's like you were self-sabotaging because you didn't feel like from your past actions with your two older kids, you deserved a second chance at being a father.
- Brock: Yeah, look, and on that statement, even that in itself was just an example of me just deflecting and being that version of myself, right? And it wasn't until the years later that I actually think about that. It's not okay to even have that as a response because that was just me, again, blaming other reasons outside of facing it up to myself.
- Brock: So I apologize for even saying that. I think I just didn't know how to handle that experience. I didn't know how to handle that at all. And I think, inherently, I always deflected to just the worst version of myself, which was just dismissing it and just like ignoring those things. 
- Brock: I said, the skill set that I developed didn't help me. So I apologize because even that's not in its full context. I was scared of being a parent again. I believed what I read. I believed I was a bad dad.
- Brock: I believed a lot of that stuff. And I just used that as an easy way out. And in reality is, you just got to do the work and you have to like look at this front on and just own that.
- Brock: And that's a part of this that I'm trying to work out of. So it does creep in again through developing a better trait or a better skill set to work in as a human race, you know, trying to blend in with everybody.
- Brock: But it's just tough sometimes. And so I apologize for that one because I was just being weak in that moment and blaming other things instead of looking deep within.

Do you now think that you do deserve a second chance at being a dad? (12:08)
- Brock: I think everyone deserves a second chance. You just can't fuck up that second chance. You've got to really, you have to understand the rules of the game.
- Brock: And this is, you're an adult. Life needs to be respected. You need to respect other people. This is not just me anymore. I said, I'm not single. I'm not running around.
- Brock: I'm a father and I'm a husband, you know? And that's a lot of responsibility. And so, yeah, I believe everyone deserves second chances, as long as they take advantage of those second chances.

Well, can you kind of expand on that a little more and just talk about the work you've done to evolve over the past couple of years and how do you feel like you've changed? (12:51)
- Brock: More recently, yeah, I get held accountable. And we're in a very unique situation where we get held accountable. And I, if anything, it's probably made me a better version of myself because it's really forced me to hold myself to that standard of being a better person.
- Brock: And I love that version I am. And I just now have to, the work that I'm focusing on is to be able to do that without the outside influence. 
- Brock: And I think over the years and I hope you've seen it that you, and even everybody else with social and that you've seen that version of me, which is why I do have close friends supporting me through this, that believe in the version that I want to be. And, and I'm not judging me for the version I was.
- Brock: I've had to have a serious conversation with myself and through the therapy and through the work, looking back and deconstructing kind of my view of who I was as a person. 
- Brock: And I've used that skill set and that therapy to kind of build on the future of where I want to go from that. But the reality is like, I've know what I was, I know what I did and I know what I could have lost.
- Brock: And that is what's helped me just focus on my family a lot more. And I think you guys have seen that. And I've been very public with that over the last couple of years, especially since we started working on literally physically working on our home from within.
- Brock: And so, outside of therapy, it's just quality time for my family. I'm just respecting the fact that at the end of the day, what I've done doesn't define who I'm going to become.

Do you ever think about if I had found out when you actually did it and I did leave, what your life would look like today? (14:35)
- Brock: Yeah, I would never have been held accountable for my actions. And I would probably be doing the same stupid things, blaming other people for the same reasons why I'm in that situation every day. 
- Brock: And that has been tremendous in my development of, or at least my growth, because I've never been modeled that type of forgiveness before. I've always had a toxic environment based on me bringing that into it. And forgiveness was an emotion that growing up I never had, I don't think.
- Scheana: I mean, that was kind of one of the hardest parts for me is that you kept this from me for two years. I was pregnant, almost died in labor, then I'm a new mom dealing with postpartum OCD, and I don't even know it. And then you proposed, we got married twice, literally said vows twice.

And I know I had this question and our audiences had it as well. But why did you wait? Were you trying to protect me? Were you trying to protect yourself? Did you just think, if I tell her now what I did last night, she's going to leave? Like, why did you wait so long? (15:38)
- Brock: I was just protecting myself, you know. I was an absolute coward. That man was a coward. And he wasn't thinking about protecting you. He was just thinking about protecting himself, saving his face. 
- Brock: You know, going back to what I was doing, I would just minimize my actions and compartmentalize it, put it in a box. But in this situation, I wrote it in a letter and then tried to forget about it. And I believe that I was never going to do it again. And we could just move past this.
- Brock: And I was just saving face, I think, at the end of the day. And that was not, you know, it was selfish. It was a self-preservation tactic, you could say. And it was just another level of betrayal that I put on top of the first one, you know.

Well, yeah. And I mean, it wasn't just a one time thing. You know, you didn't realize it was wrong after the first time, the second time. I mean, it was more than a few times. So what made you finally end it? Or did she end it? (16:48)
- Brock: No. If we get into the nitty gritty of it, me minimizing it, it was exactly that. I minimized what it was. It was a sexual affair. There was no dating. There was no courting. It was just purely that meet up. And then we had sex. And it happened multiple times.
- Brock: And then over a three week span, and I felt horrible about it. And I was like, this is not okay. I'm not doing this. And I pulled the pin and then I forgot about it. I compartmentalized it. I put it back there and I forgot about it.
- Brock: And it wasn't until we went back to San Diego a year and a half later, because again, this was a skill set that I've developed over 10, 15 years. I wasn't good in a relationship with people. I was great to people.
- Brock: But when it came to emotions, I was never available like that. And so then I didn't come back until a year and a half later. We've gone through this.
- Brock: We got married. We've had Summer and she's a year and a half. And then we go back to San Diego.
- Brock: We're hanging out there. And then I ran into some of our old friends that we used to hang out with. And that was the reminder of like, damn, that's my destructive actions might cost me everything. And then since then, it was just been building up and building up. And then eventually, ended up telling you.

If it weren't for Scandoval and all of the rumors that were coming out about you during that time, do you think you would have ever told me? (18:20)
- Brock: Yeah. Look, the Scandoval was fire on the flame, but the pressure I felt from being in San Diego, writing that letter, I remember I wrote the letter and it just carried with me. And every day it just got bigger and bigger and bigger.
- Brock: And the weight was heavier and heavier. And Scandoval on the side of it all was an element, but it wasn't the core reason. I remember going to the gym and it was just trying to convince myself, if you want to be a better version of yourself, you have to have it.
- Brock: And what I was listening to, it was like a speech and it was just about having tough conversations. And so I realized that in order for me to actually have a healthy relationship with you, one based on complete honesty, I needed to address this. 
- Brock: I've readdressed with you with my ex and everything like that, and this was the one thing that was hanging over me. It burned a hole in my heart. It really did. And then I knew that I had to tell you. And that was even the hardest thing.

What was going through your mind knowing that we were about to sit down, watch Housewives, and you were going to tell me this? Is this something you were thinking about all day on Easter? What did you think my reaction was going to be? Did you expect me to kick you out? Like, I'm just wondering what was going through your brain all day? (19:26)
- Brock: It was the whole time since I wrote that letter until then, it was always there. And then the day of I was at the gym and literally I had that motivational speech and it was kind of like encouraging you to do these hard things. So as soon as I went to the gym, I came home and I was like, you got to do it, you got to do it, you got to do it, you got to do it.
- Brock: And it was as soon as I made that decision to tell you, I came home and I sat down, I think, no, we're watching Housewives. Wasn't paying attention or anything. It was just, my heart was fucking throbbing through my chest and I had to sit down and I had to tell you, but I had, and then I had to be direct.
- Brock: I had to tell you as much information as I could give you without trying to like sugar coat it, because I didn't want to keep being this guy that gave myself excuses. So I just had to grab it by the horns and just take it on.

Looking back, there's things that I think about and question if it was a guilty feeling. Like, for example, you were so amazing when more in the second and third trimester with like the stretch mark cream, and every single night I got a massage, you put all the cream on me. Like, was part of just like those extra nice things that you did for me after you had this affair part of feeling guilty? (20:31)
- Brock: I don't think that was guilt because, and looking back on it, it was, this is crazy to say out loud, and no one has to believe me on this, but once I made the decision to move on from that, I didn't think of it. And we were golden. 
- Brock: It wasn't until post-baby, we were happy in San Diego with James and everybody came down, we went to that festival and I ran into friends of mine. And I was like, damn, this is wild. I'm going to lose everything. And so yeah, that didn't change who I was with you.
- Brock: We just went through a pregnancy together. And I was really proud of doing that with you, wasn't that? There was no like, it wasn't premeditated at all because of the affair. I got to be extra. I just committed.
- Scheana: It was just something I thought about the other night. And I was like, huh, because every time I ask you to get a knot out of my shoulder now, you get so annoyed. But I mean, I was pregnant also, but I just wondered if that was like‚Ä¶
- Brock: You know, the reason why I do that
- Scheana: Because you say to fix it myself.
- Brock: No, yeah. Yeah. You want me, you just want, honey, we're talking about me being accountable and they're going to stir me up like that.
- Scheana: Honey, it was just something I thought about the other night as I had a knot in my shoulder. And I was like, can‚Äôt I ask Brock to get this out?
- They both laugh 
- Brock: You said if you, you asked me the other day, I gave you a massage when you're consistent working on yourself and taking it, taking it into your hand, I will help you always. I am not carrying you. I will, I will be there for you when you're pregnant, I'll carry you. But when you're a fully functioning adult.

One other thing though, that I've wondered and never asked you about, looking back on the day of our, I'll say second wedding, the one that the world saw, when you were saying your vows to me and you were so emotional, did this come up? Were those guilty tears or were those just pure love? (22:35)
- Brock: That was the happiest day of my life, honey. Again, it's a psychotic path of me. I had that ability to just forget it.
- Scheana: That's wild.
- Brock: It was, and I just moved on with my life until the damage that came back up from it, popped back up. And no, I remember our wedding and the words coming out. It was just, it was just pure emotion.
- Brock: And if anyone wants to look at my brain scan, there is evidence that I don't do too much other thinking except for emotion. I'm very emotional with things. It's interesting because yeah, I don't have that depth of emotion, but I have emotion.
- Brock: So no, I generally was just in love with that day. You walked out, we had that, the rainbow was over there. What was awesome about our wedding was like, all our friends got to hang out with each other for three days beforehand.
- Brock: So they got to share stories of how they knew each other. And they just really, really just kind of brought out two worlds together. So no, that has, and my relationship with you has always just been that.
- Brock: I put it to, I forgot about it. And then when it came back up, it ate me alive. And there's like, when I was younger, I got in trouble once and I tried to steal something.
- Brock: And then I literally returned it two days later. Because I have a conscious, like I may be an asshole and I come across as an asshole, but I do have a heart in there.

Okay, so we do have to talk about the hypocrisy. You were very vocal on the last season of Vanderpump Rules about transparency and people owning their stories. While hiding this, myself as well, not just saying you, this was both of us. But as a question for you, how do you reconcile that man on screen then with the man sitting here right now? (28:37)
- Brock: I mean, I don't think there's very much justification. It was exactly what it was. It was hypocritical of us.
- Brock: The hypocrisy was real. And that's just a very bright example of literally me pointing the blame and, you know, smoking mirrors and like, oh, so it was just, it wasn't okay. Ariana definitely was going through it, her and Tom's situation.
- Brock: And I kind of played the coward way out and was just like, well, if that's happening, we can just try and preach forgiveness because we knew what we were going through. But we didn't, I didn't have the courage to stand up for it. I apologize for that.
- Brock: I think, you know, it was another piece of the damage that I left behind in my wake. You know, another example. And, you know, it's one thing to know that you have flaws, but then it's another thing to see it played out on national television.
- Scheana: Yeah. No, I mean, we were sitting on a huge secret. And so I absolutely understand that criticism. I get it. I agree, you know, but at that time, I wasn't ready to talk about this. I certainly don't think you were ready to talk about this.
- Scheana: I don't know that our marriage would have survived if we did talk about it that season. I felt like we were still very much in the middle of processing it privately. I hadn't talked to my family about it yet.
- Scheana: Literally, like no one knew. Your sister, Nema and Mark, that was it. And, you know, I wasn't about to start unraveling all of this on camera before I had even processed what it meant for our marriage, for our daughter, for our entire life.
- Scheana:  I didn't know if I was going to be strong enough to stay. It can be easier to just walk away after a betrayal and just, you know, hands are clean and be done. So, sure, I could have disclosed it then, but I would have been speaking from a place of extreme confusion, pain, fear, you know, not clarity of any sort.
- Scheana: I just, I wasn't ready. And I think I've learned the hard way. Once you say something on camera, it's out there forever, you know, even if it's not my original thought.
- Scheana: If I repeat someone else's words, it is out there forever and I have to be accountable for it. And knowing if we put this on the show, if we put this in the book, our daughter is going to find out about it one day. She's going to see it, she's going to read it.
- Scheana: We're going to have to have a conversation with her. Thankfully, not for a very long time. But I wanted to be sure of what I was going to say if I was ever going to share it before it was on the show, you know, with our inner circle, with our family.
- Scheana: I wasn't ready to share it with the world. And I think that this is a big part of where I've evolved because I now, looking back, hindsight is 2020, Ariana had every right in the world to protect her peace. That was her reality and she was giving us 100 percent that it was hard for me to see at the time.
- Scheana: But I wasn't giving 100 percent because I wasn't ready to, you know, but like Ariana didn't owe anyone a resolution on anyone else's timeline. I understand completely why she walked away from that conversation. And those type of boundaries that she has, that's something in general I'm envious of people, you know? I don't have that strength always.
- Brock: I don't think you knew you could just say no to production. I feel like you‚Ä¶
- Scheana: I would have thought I would get fired. I've never had that confidence to hold a strong boundary. I just, I show up, I do my job.
- Scheana: I have the conversations I need to have. And that was one thing looking back where I'm like, damn, that was a boss ass move to just say I'm protecting my peace.
- Brock: Yeah, it took power and she said that very clearly to us.
- Scheana: Watching her do that, even though I don't think I fully understand it at the time, but it did help me start unpacking some of my fears around setting boundaries. 
- Scheana: That is something that I want to be better with, because I've always been a people pleaser, especially when it comes to authority, production. I felt like I had to show up, I had to deliver or I could lose everything, and I wasn't willing to do that.
- Scheana: So I said some things in the moment that did not age well. I'm the first to admit that, I own that, and I also think that's what growth looks like. Realizing where you were wrong and using that to do better in the future.
- Scheana: To evolve. I also think that with Reality TV, and this was one thing I was saying at the time, I'm like, well, we agree to show 100% of our lives. We do sign up for that.
- Scheana: However, some things can remain private until we are ready to discuss them. Just because a conversation happened last night doesn't mean tomorrow I have a lunch scene. We have to disclose it.
- Brock: All though, you and your friend group love a good disclosing conversation.
- Scheana: Facts. However, with this, I felt like it's not that I'm never going to say something, but I'm going to say something on my own timeline when I'm ready to say something. I don't owe it to anyone to say it tomorrow because I found out last night.
- Scheana: And we've been through hell and back with this, but we're doing the work. It is a process for‚Ä¶
- Brock: Oh, gosh. Honey, you get to, we get to grow up, evolve, and be humans on a public platform.
- Scheana: Wild. We get to go back in time and watch our friends say things behind our backs. There's nothing normal about this.

But I do have another question for you. For me, for Summer, for your older kids, and for everyone watching our journey, listening to this podcast, what is your promise moving forward? (34:39)
- Brock: Well, look, this one, and I would like to add in here, I've learned two lessons. One was from my now wife. And then recently I learned another lesson from my ex.
- Brock: And that was one of, you know, in our relation, in a relationship, in a family, when one needs space, they don't need to ask for it. You should just give them space. And then when they need you to support, you step in. There‚Äôs a bit more in the text, but it was‚Ä¶
- Scheana: It was a very long text. One that you have to click to expand. And I read the whole thing. You needed to hear that. She, I'm proud of her for saying that. And I agreed with what she said.
- Brock: I did too. And I think that's what made it so hard for you, is that you knew she was right. Yeah, I think admitting when you're someone wrong, when you have an ego is a problem, you know? 
- Brock: And I'm the problem and I make care of that. But I would like to say, like, my promise isn't, you know, asking for forgiveness from the listeners. It's more of a promise to you and our family and my family that I will keep showing up. I will keep doing the work. I will continue to be honest and build a foundation, and our family on a foundation of honesty.
- Brock: And I want to be a living example of what a man can be after he shows his worst parts of himself. And that's what I want to be for you, for Summer, for my older two kids, and for anybody else out there who has made mistakes.
- Scheana: Yeah, I know this isn't an easy topic to discuss. So, I mean, I do appreciate you doing the podcast and sitting here with me. I can see it in your eyes. I know this is...
- Brock: We got through that, but it was rough. It's rough to have to like, realize that your actions have betrayed the ones that you love, you know?
- Brock: So I apologize to you, my love. And for everybody else out there, you got to back off, to be honest. I feel like there's a lot of opinions that get thrown away. And if all we need to do is look in a mirror, okay? I'm a hypocrite. People are hypocrites sometimes.
- Brock: And I will fight for my wife till the end of the day. And so if anyone has a problem with this affair, they shouldn't be coming and attacking her. They should be coming to me. And I'll be more than happy to buy you a coffee. And you can tell me how you feel. Okay?
- Brock: But people got to realize like, I grew up not in front of cameras for 12 years, and I made this many fuck ups. I could only imagine what it's like for you and your friends to have to do that on a national platform. 
- Brock: And then somehow find out who you are, build some confidence in your ability to own who you are. And you're my world, honey. And I've got your back. I want you to know that.
- Scheana: I know you do.
- Brock: I've got your back. And if anyone else wants to have a crack on my wife, you're welcome to, but you're gonna go through me.
- Scheana: Well, the crack that a lot of people I think are wanting to have at me is why did I stay? And I think there were a lot of nights where I didn't know if I could stay. There were moments, months, I was just convinced that the damage was too deep, the trust was too broken, and I didn't know if I would ever be able to forgive you, to trust you again.
- Scheana: And that's why I didn't tell anyone. I did not want a single outside opinion. I didn't want my mom saying, I should do this, my friend saying, I should do this.
- Scheana: I needed to figure it out for myself. And that was a very hard decision for me to make, to just suffer in silence for so, so long
- Scheana: I felt like, you know, I really had to look at the entire picture here. And you didn't run from this. You didn't minimize it or deflect.
- Scheana: You looked me in the eyes and you took full ownership. And I know that was probably one of the hardest things you've ever had to do. But you really have shown me through your actions, not just your words, because words can only mean so much after a betrayal like this.
- Scheana: But you have truly showed me through your actions that you were committed to us and committed to changing, you know, that person who you were for so long. 
- Scheana: And I also felt like I didn't want our relationship solely defined by this transgression from years prior, you know, for that to outweigh all of the positive moments that had happened since then, the life we had built together. I've truly never had a partner who is so supportive and involved and is encouraging as you are.
- Scheana: You hold me to a really high standard that sometimes is frustrating, but it's because you know what I'm capable of. And you push me in a way that no one else has ever pushed me before because you believe in me.
- Brock: Yeah, baby, you got it.
- Scheana: And that really means a lot. Like, I know that you're my biggest fan and you're an amazing partner to me. You're an incredible dad to Summer. And you're a person who reminds me every day that I deserve happiness too, you know?
- Scheana: So this wasn't easy. It isn't easy. It hasn't been, you know, easy to work through a huge struggle in our relationship. And I think that this situation, as crazy as it sounds, has in a lot of ways brought us closer. It has changed us in positive ways. 
- Scheana: And I'm really glad that we've been able to turn a dark moment in our relationship into a moment of just a deep reflection, you know, for both of us.
- Brock: For both of us, yeah.
- Scheana: Individually, yeah. And just because, you know, I chose to work through some of the hurdles in my marriage, it doesn't mean that's always the right decision for someone else. And I literally say that in the book, you know, for Tom and Ariana, there was too much damage done.
- Scheana: It was irreparable. But for us, as I say at the end of this chapter, infidelity is always gonna be a part of our story, but it's not gonna be the way our story ends. So I'm not here to advocate for anyone doing what I did.
- Scheana: If you find yourself in my shoes, which I truly hope you don't, you have to do what's best for you. And I know that sometimes even if a person might not want to throw in the towel on their relationship, their boundaries, their sense of trust, you know, it's just been violated beyond a point of repair. 
- Scheana: And I don't think there's any amount of time or therapy sessions that for some people, you know, are enough to rebuild.
- Scheana: Sometimes the only way forward is a new direction. And that's what I am so thankful, though, for us, that we were able to rebuild and repair. And it is, you know, something that we're working on still every day.
- Scheana: We have our moments. I have my insecurities. I don't want to ever question where you are.
- Scheana: But I will say, and you probably don't know this, is this isn't something that I tell you, but I think you would be very proud of me that when you tell me you're going to an event, like, maybe I check your location and make sure you've made it there safely, but I don't always. I just trust now that you are where you're telling me you're going. You could tell me you have an event in Culver City.
- Scheana: I don't know what address that is. That could be an apartment complex, but I've gotten so much better with the intrusive thoughts that I'm not going straight to that dark place like I went to probably for the first year or more.
- Brock: And well, listen, if I'm going to an event, it shouldn't be in a complex, so we're very clear. If it was, I would tell you it was in a complex
- Scheana: No, but I'm just saying, I'm not looking up the address of where you're going. You know, like, I don't know where it is if you're. Yeah, the point I'm trying to say is I'm not tracking you because you've proven that I can trust you again.
- Scheana: I will still have that voice in the back of my head. That's like, are you sure? Sometimes, like when I saw you swipe and delete that text when we were at mini golf last week, and I'm like, the fuck was that? Who is that? And you're like, it was a spam text. And I'm like, I don't delete texts.
- Scheana: So yeah, I'm going to have those triggers, you know, and I think those are warranted, but‚Ä¶
- Brock: Very warranted, and I will take it. Can I add something real quick on that? Because I know I shouldn't go on social media, look at the comments, you shouldn't, anybody.
- Brock: You should create content, don't consume it. But the narrative of, you know, the burden, the fact that I had an affair and the burden it puts on women, like if you stay with me, you have no self-worth. If you leave, you can't keep a man.
- Brock: And then there's the other woman, you know, if there's another woman, she's a homewrecker. And it's ridiculous. And honestly, fuck you guys for coming at my wife like that.
- Brock: I'm the one that betrayed her and you're going to judge her based on her actions when she was 20 something. I have a problem with that because reality is, I'm the problem here. She's just telling her story and you guys want to hear her story. So I love you, honey.
- Scheana: I love you.
- Brock: Anyone that has a problem with that, you know where to find me.
- Scheana: So where do we go from here? You know, we're still healing. There's no perfect bow to wrap this all up with.
- Scheana: We have our good days. We have our hard days. But one thing I do know is that this honesty, as I said earlier, I think it's really brought us closer.
- Scheana: I think transparency has allowed us to rebuild on something solid. I think choosing to share this, you know, with the world is healing in its own sense, too. It's part of it.
- Scheana: So last thing I'm going to say. So if you're someone who has faced betrayal or shame or judgment for staying, I see you. I'm with you.
- Scheana: You are not alone. And if cheating was the end of your story, I completely understand that, too, because sometimes you do have to walk away. But I also just want to be a person here to say sometimes it is okay to stay.

I‚Äôm putting this out there in case anyone else feels the same.

Life can get busy ‚Äî chasing goals, building careers, choosing peace over parties, and sometimes just going solo because it‚Äôs easier than small talk or noisy nights out. But every now and then, it hits you‚Ä¶ it might be nice to just sit down with someone over coffee, no pressure, no expectations, no alcohol ‚Äî just a quiet moment of connection in this busy, loud world.

If you‚Äôre a fellow introvert, or someone who's intentionally single and focused on your own path but open to making a genuine connection ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs friendship or just a quick breath of fresh air together ‚Äî let‚Äôs grab a cup of coffee sometime.

No awkward group settings, no big events. Just one-on-one, or maybe a tiny group of like-minded people. No need to impress, no networking, just real people being human for a little while.

If this sounds like something you‚Äôd say yes to, drop a comment or DM. We can figure something simple, public, and low-key in CDO.

I‚Äôm 28 and like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Here's my shot at an intro. üôÇ

Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back to my other love, history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.



I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after ‚Äî all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? ü§£



Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through.



Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I‚Äôm listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already.",1,1753464883.0,UkFriends,0,1.0,False

1m95hyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m95hyj/the_heir_by_kiera_cass_read_online_free/,The Heir by Kiera Cass Read online Free:,"¬† CHAPTER 1  
  
¬† I COULD NOT HOLD MY breath for seven minutes. I couldn‚Äôt even make it to one. I once tried to run a mile in seven minutes after hearing some athletes could do it in four but failed spectacularly when a side stitch crippled me about halfway in.  
  
¬† However, there was one thing I managed to do in seven minutes that most would say is quite impressive: I became queen.  
  
¬† By seven tiny minutes I beat my brother Ahren into the world, so the throne that ought to have been his was mine. Had I been born a generation earlier, it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. Ahren was the male, so Ahren would have been the heir.  
  
¬† Alas, Mom and Dad couldn‚Äôt stand to watch their firstborn be stripped of a title by an unfortunate but rather lovely set of breasts. So they changed the law, and the people rejoiced, and I was trained day by day to become the next ruler of Ill√©a.  
  
¬† What they didn‚Äôt understand was that their attempts to make my life fair seemed rather unfair to me.  
  
¬† I tried not to complain. After all, I knew how fortunate I was. But there were days, or sometimes months, when it felt like far too much was piled on me, too much for any one person, really.  
  
¬† I flipped through the newspaper and saw that there had been yet another riot, this time in Zuni. Twenty years ago, Dad‚Äôs first act as king was to dissolve the castes, and the old system had been phased out slowly over my lifetime. I still thought it was completely bizarre that once upon a time people lived with these limiting but arbitrary labels on their backs. Mom was a Five; Dad was a One. It made no sense, especially since there was no outward sign of the divisions. How was I supposed to know if I was walking next to a Six or a Three? And why did that even matter?  
  
¬† When Dad had first decreed that the castes were no more, people all over the country had been delighted. Dad had expected the changes he was making in Ill√©a to be comfortably in place over the course of a generation, meaning any day now everything should click.  
  
¬† That wasn‚Äôt happening‚Äîand this new riot was just the most recent in a string of unrest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCoffee, Your Highness,‚Äù Neena said, setting the drink on my table.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you. You can take the plates.‚Äù  
  
¬† I scanned the article. This time a restaurant was burned to the ground because its owner refused to promote a waiter to a position as a chef. The waiter claimed that a promotion had been promised but was never delivered, and he was sure it was because of his family‚Äôs past.  
  
¬† Looking at the charred remains of the building, I honestly didn‚Äôt know whose side I was on. The owner had the right to promote or fire anyone he wanted, and the waiter had the right not to be seen as something that, technically, didn‚Äôt exist anymore.  
  
¬† I pushed the paper away and picked up my drink. Dad was going to be upset. I was sure he was already running the scenario over and over in his head, trying to figure out how to set it right. The problem was, even if we could fix one issue, we couldn‚Äôt stop every instance of post-caste discrimination. It was too hard to monitor and happening far too often.  
  
¬† I set down my coffee and headed to my closet. It was time to start the day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNeena,‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúDo you know where that plum-colored dress is? The one with the sash?‚Äù  
  
¬† She squinted in concentration as she came over to help.  
  
¬† In the grand scheme of things, Neena was new to the palace. She‚Äôd only been working with me for six months, after my last maid fell ill for two weeks. Neena was acutely attuned to my needs and much more agreeable to be around, so I kept her on. I also admired her eye for fashion.  
  
¬† Neena stared into the massive space. ‚ÄúMaybe we should reorganize.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can if you have the time. That‚Äôs not a project I‚Äôm interested in.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot when I can hunt down your clothes for you,‚Äù she teased.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù  
  
¬† She took my humor in stride, laughing as she quickly sorted through gowns and pants.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like your hair today,‚Äù I commented.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù All the maids wore caps, but Neena was still creative with her hairdos. Sometimes a few thick, black curls would frame her face, and other times she twisted back strands until they were all tucked away. At the moment there were wide braids encircling her head, with the rest of her hair under her cap. I really enjoyed that she found ways to work with her uniform, to make it her own each day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh! It‚Äôs back here.‚Äù Neena pulled down the knee-length dress, fanning it out across the dark skin of her arm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPerfect! And do you know where my gray blazer is? The one with the three-quarter sleeves?‚Äù  
  
¬† She stared at me, her face deadpan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely rearranging.‚Äù  
  
¬† I giggled. ‚ÄúYou search; I‚Äôll dress.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pulled on my outfit and brushed out my hair, preparing for another day as the future face of the monarchy. The outfit was feminine enough to soften me but strong enough that I‚Äôd be taken seriously. It was a fine line to walk, but I did it every day.  
  
¬† Staring into the mirror, I talked to my reflection.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are Eadlyn Schreave. You are the next person in line to run this country, and you will be the first girl to do it on your own. No one,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúis as powerful as you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dad was already in his office, brow furrowed as he took in the news. Other than my eyes, I didn‚Äôt look much like him. Or Mom, for that matter.  
  
¬† With my dark hair, oval-shaped face, and a hint of a tan that lingered year round, I looked more like my grandmother than anyone else. A painting of her on her coronation day hung in the fourth-floor hallway, and I used to study it when I was younger, trying to guess at how I would look as I grew. Her age in the portrait was near to mine now, and though we weren‚Äôt identical, I sometimes felt like her echo.  
  
¬† I walked across the room and kissed Dad‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMorning. Did you see the papers?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. At least no one died this time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank goodness for that.‚Äù Those were the worst, the ones where people were left dead in the street or went missing. It was terrible, reading the names of young men who‚Äôd been beaten simply for moving their families into a nicer neighborhood or women who were attacked for trying to get a job that in the past would not have been open to them.  
  
¬† Sometimes it took no time at all to find the motive and the person behind these crimes, but more often than not we were faced with a lot of finger-poi  
nting and no real answers. It was exhausting for me to watch, and I knew it was worse for Dad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand it.‚Äù He took off his reading glasses and rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want the castes anymore. We took our time, eliminated them slowly so everyone could adjust. Now they‚Äôre burning down buildings.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs there a way to regulate this? Could we create a board to oversee grievances?‚Äù I looked at the photo again. In the corner, the young son of the restaurant owner wept over losing everything. In my heart I knew complaints would come in faster than anyone could address them, but I also knew Dad couldn‚Äôt bear doing nothing.  
  
¬† Dad looked at me. ‚ÄúIs that what you would do?‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôd ask my father what he would do.‚Äù  
  
¬† He sighed. ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt always be an option for you, Eadlyn. You need to be strong, decisive. How would you fix this one particular incident?‚Äù  
  
¬† I considered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can. There‚Äôs no way to prove the old castes were why the waiter was denied the promotion. The only thing we can do is launch an investigation into who set the fire. That family lost their livelihood today, and someone needs to be held responsible. Arson is not how you exact justice.‚Äù  
  
¬† He shook his head at the paper. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôd like to be able to help them. But, more than that, we need to figure out how to prevent this from happening again. It‚Äôs become rampant, Eadlyn, and it‚Äôs frightening.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dad tossed the paper into the trash, then stood and walked to the window. I could read the stress in his posture. Sometimes his role brought him so much joy, like visiting the schools he‚Äôd worked tirelessly to improve or seeing communities flourish in the war-free era he‚Äôd ushered in. But those instances were becoming few and far between. Most days he was anxious about the state of the country, and he had to fake his smiles when reporters came by, hoping that his sense of calm would somehow spread to everyone else. Mom helped shoulder the burden, but at the end of the day the fate of the country was placed squarely on his back. One day it would be on mine.  
  
¬† Vain as it was, I worried I would go gray prematurely.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMake a note for me, Eadlyn. Remind me to write Governor Harpen in Zuni. Oh, and put to write it to Joshua Harpen, not his father. I keep forgetting he was the one who ran in the last election.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wrote his instructions in my elegant cursive, thinking how pleased Dad would be when he looked at it later. He used to give me the worst time over my penmanship.  
  
¬† I was grinning to myself when I looked back at him, but my face fell almost immediately when I saw him rubbing his forehead, trying so desperately to think of a solution to these problems.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù  
  
¬† He turned and instinctively squared his shoulders, like he needed to act strong even in front of me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy do you think this is happening? It wasn‚Äôt always like this.‚Äù  
  
¬† He raised his eyebrows. ‚ÄúIt certainly wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, almost to himself. ‚ÄúAt first everyone seemed pleased. Every time we removed a new caste, people held parties. It‚Äôs only been in the last few years, since all the labels have officially been erased, that it‚Äôs gone downhill.‚Äù  
  
¬† He stared back out the window. ‚ÄúThe only thing I can think is that those who grew up with the castes are aware of how much better this is. Comparatively, it‚Äôs easier to marry or work. A family‚Äôs finances aren‚Äôt capped by a single profession. There are more choices when it comes to education. But those who are growing up without the castes and are still running into opposition . . . I guess they don‚Äôt know what else to do.‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked at me and shrugged. ‚ÄúI need time,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúI need a way to put things on pause, set them right, and press play again.‚Äù  
  
¬† I noted the deep furrow in his brow. ‚ÄúDad, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible.‚Äù  
  
¬† He chuckled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done it before. I can remember. . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† The focus in his eyes changed. He watched me for a moment, seeming to ask me a question without words.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù  
  
¬† He blinked a few times. ‚ÄúYes, dear, quite all right. Why don‚Äôt you get to work on those budget cuts. We can go over your ideas this afternoon. I need to speak with your mother.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Math wasn‚Äôt a skill that came to me naturally, so I had to work twice as long on any proposals for budget cuts or financial plans. But I absolutely refused to have one of Dad‚Äôs advisers come behind me with a calculator to clean up my mess. Even if I had to stay up all night, I always made sure my work was accurate.  
  
¬† Of course, Ahren was naturally good at math, but he was never forced to sit through meetings about budgets or rezoning or health care. He got off scot-free by seven stupid minutes.  
  
¬† Dad patted me on the shoulder before dashing out of the room. It took me longer than usual to focus on the numbers. I couldn‚Äôt help but be distracted by the look on his face and the unmistakable certainty that it was tied to me.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 2  
  
¬† AFTER WORKING ON THE BUDGET report for a few hours, I decided I needed a break and retreated to my room to get a hand massage from Neena. I loved those little bits of luxury in my day. Dresses made to my exact measurements, exotic desserts flown in simply because it was Thursday, and an endless supply of beautiful things were all perks; and they were easily my favorite parts of the job.  
  
¬† My room overlooked the gardens. As the day shifted, the light changed to a warm, honey color, brightening the high walls. I focused on the heat and Neena‚Äôs deliberate fingers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnyway, his face got all funny. It was kind of like he disappeared for a minute.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was trying to explain Dad‚Äôs out-of-character departure this morning, but it was hard to get it across. I didn‚Äôt even know if he found Mom or not, as he never came back to the office.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôs sick? He does seem tired these days.‚Äù Neena‚Äôs hands worked her magic as she spoke.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoes he?‚Äù I asked, thinking that Dad didn‚Äôt seem tired exactly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably just stressed. How could he not be with all the decisions he has to make?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd someday that will be you,‚Äù she commented, her tone a mix of genuine worry and playful amusement.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhich means you will be giving me twice as many massages.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think in a few years I might like to try something new.‚Äù  
  
¬† I scrunched my face. ‚ÄúWhat else would you do? There aren‚Äôt many positions better than working in the palace.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a knock on the door, and she didn‚Äôt have a chance to answer the question.  
  
¬† I stood, throwing my blazer back on to look presentable, and gave a nod to Neena to let my guests in.  
  
¬† Mom came around the door, smiling, with Dad contentedly trailing her steps. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice it was always this way. At state events or important dinners, Mom was beside Dad or situated right behind him. But when they were just husband and wife‚Äînot king and queen‚Äîhe followed her everywhere.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi, Mom.‚Äù I walked over to hug her.  
  
¬† Mom tucked my hair behind my ear, smiling at me. ‚ÄúI like this look.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stood back proudly and smoothed out my dress with my hands. ‚ÄúThe bracelets really set it off, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù  
  
¬† She giggled. ‚ÄúExcellent attention to detail.‚Äù Every once in a while Mom let me pick out jewelry or shoes for her, but it was rare. Mom didn‚Äôt find it as much fun as I did, and she didn‚Äôt rely on the extras for beauty. In her case, she really didn‚Äôt need it. I liked that she was classic.  
  
¬† Mom turned and touched Neena‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre excused,‚Äù she said quietly.  
  
¬† Neena instantly curtsied and left us alone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, sweetheart. We simply want to speak in private.‚Äù Dad held out a hand and ushered us all to the table. ‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to talk to you about.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOpportunity? Are we traveling?‚Äù I adored traveling. ‚ÄúPlease tell me we‚Äôre finally going on a beach trip. Could i  
t just be the six of us?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot exactly. We wouldn‚Äôt be going somewhere so much as having visitors,‚Äù Mom explained.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh! Company! Who‚Äôs coming?‚Äù  
  
¬† They exchanged glances, then Mom continued talking. ‚ÄúYou know that things are precarious right now. The people are restless and unhappy, and we cannot figure out how to ease the tension.‚Äù  
  
¬† I sighed. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeking a way to boost morale,‚Äù Dad added.  
  
¬† I perked up. Morale boosting typically involved a celebration. And I was always up for a party.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did you have in mind?‚Äù I started designing a new dress in my head and dismissed it almost as quickly. That wasn‚Äôt what needed my attention at the moment.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Dad started, ‚Äúthe public responds best to something positive with our family. When your mother and I were married, it was one of the best seasons in our country. And do you remember how people threw parties in the street when they found out Osten was coming?‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled. I was eight when Osten was born, and I‚Äôd never forget how excited everyone got just over the announcement. I heard music playing from my bedroom practically until dawn.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was marvelous.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was. And now the people look to you. It won‚Äôt be long before you‚Äôre queen.‚Äù Dad paused. ‚ÄúWe thought that perhaps you‚Äôd be willing to do something publicly, something that would be exciting for the people but also might be very beneficial to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I narrowed my eyes, not sure where this was going. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom cleared her throat. ‚ÄúYou know that in the past, princesses were married off to princes from other countries to solidify our international relations.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI did hear you use the past tense there, correct?‚Äù  
  
¬† She laughed, but I wasn‚Äôt amused. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. Because Prince Nathaniel looks like a zombie, Prince Hector dances like a zombie, and if the prince from the German Federation doesn‚Äôt learn to embrace personal hygiene by the Christmas party, he shouldn‚Äôt be invited.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom rubbed the side of her head in frustration. ‚ÄúEadlyn, you‚Äôve always been so picky.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dad shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs not a bad thing,‚Äù he said, earning a glare from Mom.  
¬† I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat in the world are you talking about?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know how your mother and I met,‚Äù Dad began.  
  
¬† I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúEveryone does. You two are practically a fairy tale.‚Äù  
  
¬† At those words their eyes went soft, and smiles washed over their faces. Their bodies seemed to tilt slightly toward each other, and Dad bit his lip looking at Mom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me. Firstborn in the room, do you mind?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom blushed as Dad cleared his throat and continued. ‚ÄúThe Selection process was very successful for us. And though my parents had their problems, it worked well for them, too. So . . . we were hoping. . . .‚Äù He hesitated and met my eyes.  
  
¬† I was slow to pick up on their hints. I knew what the Selection was, but never, not even once, had it been suggested as an option for any of us, let alone me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom put up her hands, cautioning me. ‚ÄúJust listen‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA Selection?‚Äù I burst out. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEadlyn, you‚Äôre being irrational.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glared at her. ‚ÄúYou promised‚Äîyou promised‚Äîyou‚Äôd never force me into marrying someone for an alliance. How is this any better?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHear us out,‚Äù she urged.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCalm down, love.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me like that. I‚Äôm not a child!‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre certainly acting like one.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ruining my life!‚Äù I ran my fingers through my hair and took several deep breaths, hoping it would help me think. This couldn‚Äôt happen. Not to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge opportunity,‚Äù Dad insisted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to shackle me to a stranger!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI told you she‚Äôd be stubborn,‚Äù Mom muttered to Dad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWonder where she gets that from,‚Äù he shot back with a smile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about me like I‚Äôm not in the room!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Dad said. ‚ÄúWe just need you to consider this.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about Ahren? Can‚Äôt he do it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAhren isn‚Äôt going to be the future king. Besides, he has Camille.‚Äù  
  
¬† Princess Camille was the heir to the French throne, and a few years ago she‚Äôd managed to bat her lashes all the way into Ahren‚Äôs heart.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen make them get married!‚Äù I pleaded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCamille will be queen when her time comes, and she, like you, will have to ask her partner to marry her. If it was Ahren‚Äôs choice, we‚Äôd consider it; but it‚Äôs not.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about Kaden? Can‚Äôt you have him do it?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom laughed humorlessly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fourteen! We don‚Äôt have that kind of time. The people need something to be excited about now.‚Äù She narrowed her eyes at me. ‚ÄúAnd, honestly, isn‚Äôt it time you look for someone to rule beside you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Dad nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs not a role that should be shouldered alone.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to get married,‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt make me do this. I‚Äôm only eighteen.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhich is how old I was when I married your father,‚Äù Mom stated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready,‚Äù I urged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a husband. Please don‚Äôt do this to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom reached across the table and put her hand on mine. ‚ÄúNo one would be doing anything to you. You would be doing something for your people. You‚Äôd be giving them a gift.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou mean faking a smile when I‚Äôd rather cry?‚Äù  
  
¬† She gave me a fleeting frown. ‚ÄúThat has always been part of our job.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stared at her, silently demanding a better answer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEadlyn, why don‚Äôt you take some time to think this over?‚Äù Dad said calmly. ‚ÄúI know this is a big thing we‚Äôre asking of you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoes that mean I have a choice?‚Äù  
  
¬† Dad inhaled deeply, considering. ‚ÄúWell, love, you‚Äôll really have thirty-five choices.‚Äù  
  
¬† I leaped up from my chair, pointing toward the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúGet! Out!‚Äù  
  
¬† Without another word they left my room.  
  
¬† Didn‚Äôt they know who I was, what they‚Äôd trained me for? I was Eadlyn Schreave. No one was more powerful than me.  
  
¬† So if they thought I was going down without a fight, they were sadly mistaken.

I‚Äôm 28 and like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Here's my shot at an intro. üôÇ

Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back to my other love, history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.



I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after ‚Äî all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? ü§£



Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through.



Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I‚Äôm listening.

I must say I was happy from the results, The sensor can pretty easily distinguish between dark and light, but when it came to the light and light plus it showed some distinct different values of Red orange blue and green couldn't use the near infrared band since the box lid was reflecting back quit a lot of it.

The place is beyond toxic. Nobody cares about people anymore. They just care about deadlines.

You could be sick, on vacation, dealing with something personal, whatever; all they care about is whether the work got done. I have literally had to respond to pings while sick in bed. Got paged on weekends for changes that were not even in production. Just pointless tasks that easily could have waited. No respect for personal time or boundaries.

The return to office push was the final straw for me. We proved for years that remote work was just as productive if not better. But leadership kept dragging people back into buildings just to make it look like things were normal. They say it is about collaboration but no one is actually collaborating. Everyone is tired and wants out.

And I have to say it because no one talks about it enough; the hygiene situation in the office is disgusting. Grown adults using the bathroom and walking straight out without even looking at the sink. Like did you just forget how to be a functioning member of society? It is nasty and I hated touching anything in there. Keyboards, door handles, coffee machines. It felt like a health risk every day.

And Jamie Dimon, if you ever read this; Fuck You!! you are hands down the worst CEO I have ever worked under. Completely out of touch with your own employees. Forcing return to office like we are children who need to be babysat. No one respects it. No one wants it. And people are leaving because of it. Good luck holding on to your workforce while pretending this is leadership.

I am done. I am never going back. There is life after JPMC and I already feel more human just being out.

If you are still there and feeling the same way, please know it is not just you. It really is that bad. And you deserve better.",32,1753464581.0,JPMorganChase,9,0.88,False

Chapter One:  
  
Dark clouds hung low over the water; flashes of lightning and the low rumble of thunder reverberating from deep within the approaching storm could be seen and heard. Early spring winds tore across the icy waters of the Pacific, slamming into California‚Äôs rocky coastline and howling over the barren fields.¬†  
  
Dark clouds hung low over the water; flashes of lightning and the low rumble of thunder reverberating from deep within the approaching storm could be seen and heard. Early spring winds tore across the icy waters of the Pacific, slamming into California‚Äôs rocky coastline and howling over the barren fields.¬†

Barrett Schwarz sat in his car, drumming on his steering wheel, staring into the encroaching black as it marched ever closer. The vehicle rocked occasionally under the force of powerful gusts; the government-issued black ‚Äô53 Studebaker Starliner he was sitting in held firm despite the storm‚Äôs wrath. The engine hummed steadily as the car idled alone in a small, empty parking lot overlooking a winding footpath leading to the distant shore below. Windshield wipers flicked back and forth, whisking away the light rain that had already begun falling. Reaching down to the radio, Barrett turned the volume dial to the right; the upbeat music from a popular band filtered through the speaker. The music did little to drown out the sound of the storm, but it was something to distract him while he waited.

¬†

Barrett knew the rain would soon transform into a pounding downpour, making his drive back to the city a pain in the ass. The tires on the car were going bald due to the government always choosing the lowest bidder and buying the cheapest equipment. The car ran, but the tires were almost useless on anything other than a perfectly dry road. He glanced at his wristwatch, the small, dimly illuminated dial showing 4:35 PM. Though it was late-afternoon, the storm‚Äôs thick clouds smothered any sunlight struggling to break through. Letting out a slow, exasperated sigh, Barrett‚Äôs frustration mounted with each passing minute. ‚ÄúHow hard is it to be on time?‚Äù he growled, eyes narrowing as they scanned the road for any signs of an approaching vehicle, fingers curling around the wheel tightly in frustration.

¬†

A deep chuckle broke the tension emanating from the man sitting next to him. ‚ÄúAbrams is a Sunday driver. He obeys every rule of the road to the letter. He‚Äôll get here‚Ä¶ eventually.‚Äù John McCallan, Barrett‚Äôs partner and friend of seven years, was built like a wall. John seemed almost too large to fit comfortably in the passenger seat. His broad shoulders pressed against the passenger door as his folded arms rested heavily across his chest. Scars and calluses on his hands testified to a hard life, and the subtle, crisscrossed marks on his forearms spoke to a violent profession. Salt-and-pepper hair cropped close framed a face etched with subtle lines of age and experience, lending him a dignified air. What drew most people‚Äôs attention was his sharp, unwavering gaze‚Äîthe look of a man who acted decisively and brought unholy violence to anyone foolish enough to challenge him. John smirked. ‚ÄúYou know, Barrett, it‚Äôs okay to slow down and enjoy life. We‚Äôve got the ocean, the beach, and that‚Ä¶‚Äù He gestured toward the storm and its increasingly frequent flashes of lightning. ‚Äú An approaching wall of death.‚Äù¬†

A bolt of lightning slammed into the ocean a few hundred meters away, the near-deafening boom rattling the car‚Äôs windows. Making Barrett jump, he gripped the steering wheel tightly. ‚ÄúShit, John. I enjoy downtime as much as the next guy, but I‚Äôd rather not get fried by lightning. If I‚Äôm going to die, I‚Äôd prefer it to be in a way I can be proud of,‚Äù Barrett retorted. Another flash and boom announced a lightning strike, hitting the beach this time. Both men exchanged a quick, fearful glance before nervous laughter bubbled up, dispelling the tension.¬†

¬†

John turned, his eyes appraising Barrett. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing my workout, haven‚Äôt you? You‚Äôre not as pudgy as you were two weeks ago.‚Äù He jabbed Barrett‚Äôs side with two of his massive fingers. ‚ÄúGuess there‚Äôs hope for you yet.‚Äù Barrett laughed, batting John‚Äôs hand away. ‚ÄúNot everyone can be a brick wall like you. I may have some pudge, but at least I can read and write above a third-grade level.‚Äù Barrett had been trying to get in better shape. At 5‚Äô9‚Äù, even a few extra pounds were noticeable. He glanced in the mirror, glimpsing his red hair, which was getting too long and would soon invite his coworkers‚Äô teasing. He ran a hand over his beard, appreciating how it masked his boyish features‚Äîa necessity in his line of work.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúEasy there, Ginger,‚Äù John quipped. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you getting offended now that you‚Äôre starting to resemble a pile of pudding. I need you to be able to run more than five feet if we get into a chase again.‚Äù Barrett opened his mouth to respond but stopped when headlights pierced the darkness. The lights bounced slightly as a vehicle crested the hill, growing brighter as it approached. Its wipers were working furiously to clear the rain, the muted sound of tires crunching on gravel barely carried over the storm‚Äôs fury. The car slowed and pulled alongside Barrett‚Äôs vehicle. the storm‚Äôs downpour was relentless now.

‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù John said, his tone sharp. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what was so important that we had to meet him out here.‚Äù Barrett turned the hand crank on his driver‚Äôs side window, lowering the glass a few inches. Rain splashed into the car quickly, soaking his left arm and chilling him; the familiar smell of salt water smacked him in the face hard. The driver of the other vehicle lowered their window in kind, revealing Henry Abrams‚Äôs face. An overly enthusiastic Brit whose good-natured enthusiasm was undeterred by the weather. ‚ÄúBeautiful day for a drive, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Abrams called out, his voice raised to be heard over the rain. ‚ÄúReminds me of the weather back home,‚Äù he continued with a laugh. ‚ÄúNo sun, just an eternity of rain and gray.‚Äù ‚ÄúI finally understand why so many of you Brits are raging alcoholics, if this is what you call pleasant weather,‚Äù Barrett replied. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Abrams? What‚Äôs so urgent that we had to meet today?‚Äù Abrams‚Äôs smile faded slightly as he reached down and brought up a sealed manila folder, the British government‚Äôs insignia stamped prominently on the front. ‚ÄúTrouble on the Western Front, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù Barrett reached out and grabbed the folder from Abrams‚Äô hand, pulling it into his vehicle, wiping away the rain that was attempting to soak into the document. ‚ÄúWhat kind of trouble?‚Äù Abrams‚Äôs smile was gone completely now; all the laughter previously there vanished with concern. ‚ÄúThe Germans and Russians are kidnapping Toxkins,‚Äù he yelled across the gap between the vehicles. ‚ÄúMI5 had some operatives deep behind the Argonne Line go dark; they were investigating the disappearances. The last communication we got from them mentioned a Russian delegation headed to Berlin to meet with the SS about Toxkins. We believe they are going to be meeting with Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Karl Schneider.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett felt a twinge in his gut at the mention of Toxkins. The mere thought of them was enough to make his skin crawl. Toxkins was a slur more than anything. These were soldiers and civilians who had been exposed to a German chemical weapon. What had been meant to be a more lethal successor to mustard gas mercilessly killed thousands, also had the unintended consequence of turning survivors into something... different... dangerous. People didn‚Äôt trust them, and for good reasons: ‚ÄúWhat you have in your hands is all the information we have for now.‚Äù Barrett ran his fingers along the sealed edges of the folder, testing its weight. He handed the package to John, who opened it, peeked inside, and sighed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much in here, Abe,‚Äù he said, his hands reaching in and pulling out a small pile of papers. ‚ÄúWhat are we supposed to do with five pages of rumors and hearsay? This is not even close to being a full report.‚Äù¬†

¬†

John looked up at Abrams, his face demonstrating frustration at what he felt was a waste of time. ‚ÄúAbe, you have to be joking. You told us to meet at the last minute for this? A stack of near-useless information about something we can‚Äôt act on! Where‚Äôs the rest of it?‚Äù Barrett raised a hand, cutting off John‚Äôs ranting. He turned to Abrams again. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not wrong, Abe. What are you holding out on us? Why couldn‚Äôt this information wait and get passed down through the regular channels between our employers? What got you so spooked that you had us meet you out here in the middle of a tsunami for what sounds like nothing we can move on?‚Äù¬†

¬†

Abrams shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his gaze darting to the rain-smeared windshield. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one more thing,‚Äù he said, reaching into his coat pocket. The motion was deliberate, almost hesitant, as if he were debating whether to hand over what he had. From the folds of his coat, he produced a small, creased photograph encased in a thin, fogged plastic sleeve. He extended it to Barrett, who took it carefully, his brow furrowed as he studied the image.¬†

¬†

The photo was grainy and damaged; it looked as though it had been taken by a low-quality camera and then run over several times. It depicted a group of men standing in what appeared to be a small room, their faces half hidden in shadows from poor lighting. The uniforms were unmistakably German SS, pristine and rigid. But what grabbed Barrett‚Äôs attention was the figure standing in the center. He was tall, his face half hidden. What was visible of his face revealed an emotionless madman: he sported a neatly trimmed beard and piercing, almost predatory eyes. The man‚Äôs arm stretched outward as if gesturing to something or someone, just beyond the edge of the frame. Behind him, a black banner with a strange symbol‚Äînot the usual Nazi insignia‚Äîhung like a sinister backdrop. The insignia was a complex series of golden straight lines that crossed in the middle, each etched with runic characters that seemed to shift and twist when viewed for too long. A deep crimson circle occupied the center of the symbol. A singular concentric ring adorned with cryptic markings encircled the odd design. The bottom of the flag beneath the image carried the motto ‚ÄúWas verborgen ist, wird offenbar werden.‚Äù Barrett recognized the motto ‚ÄúWhat is Hidden will be Revealed.‚Äù He took a moment trying to remember where he had come across that same saying before. He racked his brain, but all he could recall was seeing it in an old book he had read while he was a child in Dresden. Tearing his eyes from the insignia and wording, his eyes returned to the man in the center of the picture, tapping it with the tip of his finger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd recognize that face anywhere, that‚Äôs Karl Schneider, the butcher of Warsaw.‚Äù¬†

¬†

An uncomfortable shiver crawled up Barrett‚Äôs spine just from saying the man‚Äôs name. As he scanned the rest of the picture, he noticed someone else in the image whom he had not noticed at first. They appeared to almost blend into the background, standing separate from the SS officers. They seemed to be wearing a Russian intelligence officer uniform. She was a tall woman with shoulder-length hair and what appeared to be a blank expression, almost doll-like. Something about her made Barrett feel uncomfortable looking at her. He handed the photograph to John, who peered at it intently. ‚ÄúThat symbol?‚Äù Barrett paused, thinking deeply. The symbol seemed so out of place for an SS officer meeting; it left him thoroughly confused and worried. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the girl? John said she is not German and that Russian uniform proves she is absolutely not SS.‚Äù Looking up, John‚Äôs head turned towards Abrams, hoping he would have the answer.

¬†

Abrams nodded grimly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs got MI5 spooked. It has been showing up in places it shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîdocuments, facilities, and uniforms. Almost every time we get a picture just like that one, we see that same woman somewhere in it, it‚Äôs too much of a damn coincidence to think.‚Äù The air in the car grew heavier, the rhythmic patter of the rain now feeling like a drumbeat of dread. Barrett didn‚Äôt need to say what both he and John were thinking. Something dangerous was happening, and they had no idea what any of this meant. Abrams shifted in his seat and leaned forward slightly, his tone hardening. ‚ÄúThis is what you‚Äôre dealing with. Schneider isn‚Äôt just a mindless butcher; he‚Äôs smart, cunning, and he‚Äôs got something big in the works.‚Äù Abrams paused as thunder roared from a nearby lightning strike, drowning out their conversation. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs behind the meaning of that symbol and the presence of our mystery Russian... it‚Äôs not good.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett saw Abram‚Äôs sigh deeply and looked down, shaking his head as if debating whether to say anything else. His head came back up as he yelled into the rain again, ‚ÄúLook, I know it‚Äôs not a lot, but it‚Äôs all I have for you. My higher-ups don‚Äôt even know I gave you this. They‚Äôve been sitting on this for nearly three weeks and have no plans of sharing it with your government. I don‚Äôt like either of you cunts, but I hate Nazis more, so you can be grateful for what I get you.‚Äù Barrett and John looked at each other, and both men burst out laughing. Barrett felt slightly lightheaded from laughing so hard, the tension dissipating slightly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard you swear before, Abrams,‚Äù he said between laughs, ‚Äúmy virgin ears.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Abrams cracked a small smile. ‚ÄúYou Yanks can get fucked for all I care, but I don‚Äôt want your bloody incompetence bringing me and my country down with you.‚Äù With a nod, he started rolling up his window and grabbed the gear shifter, putting the car in drive. ‚ÄúNo one knows you have that. Don‚Äôt let me hang for this.‚Äù With a roar from his engine and a spray of loose gravel shooting out from his tires, Barrett watched as Abrams‚Äô car sped off out of the parking lot and down the empty road, quickly disappearing from sight as he watched the vehicle in the rearview mirror.¬†

¬†

Barrett put his hand on the window crank and rolled it up the rest of the way and sat there wiping away the water, trying to dry the door interior a little. The only sound in the vehicle was the rustling of pages as John went through the documents. Occasionally, Barrett could hear John muttering something under his breath as he read. He knew better than to interrupt John; the man was working and was processing in detail the information provided to them. Barrett replayed the interaction through his mind, waiting for John to get done reading. So much of what Abrams had told them didn‚Äôt make sense. Why was MI5 not willing to share this information through the proper channels, and why were they reportedly just sitting on this information? Granted, this wasn‚Äôt earth-shattering information. The Russian Federation and the Germans were allies, and having secret meetings wasn‚Äôt all that strange.¬†

¬†John let out a sigh and shoved the picture and the papers back into the folder, tossing it into the glove compartment in front of him. He folded his arms again and stared out into the storm, his eyes shifting slightly back and forth as he processed information internally, his mouth moving in a silent conversation that only he was involved in. ‚ÄúThis is weird,‚Äù John finally said. ‚ÄúIf Abrams was right, and this information is legitimate, and this is cause for concern... I don‚Äôt know... this is nothing.‚Äù He took a calming breath before going on. ‚ÄúWe have what? One name, no dates even, just a mention of Berlin, and not even who this mystery Russian bitch is and why it‚Äôs so concerning; is she a scientist, a doctor, a soldier, or God forbid, a Toxkin? She is just appearing randomly in all these pictures, and no one even knows her name!‚Äù¬†

¬†

The vehicle fell silent again as both men sat there thinking, trying to make sense of a very odd meeting that seemed almost a waste of their time. ‚ÄúYou want to take it back to Ironwood and run it past the team to see what they think?‚Äù Barrett suggested, not wanting to just sit idly in the car anymore, in wet clothes, he had a gnawing hunger in his gut, which was making it hard to think. John nodded. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some food first. I‚Äôm hungry as hell, and I want a little more time to think before we take it to the boss. He‚Äôs going to want an actionable plan for this, but it‚Äôs so bare bones that I have nothing on how we can make this beneficial for us.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett shifted the car into drive and took off out of the parking lot and down the road, heading down the hill back towards the city. Inside the car, it was silent for most of the 45-minute drive back. The windshield wipers worked frantically to clear the water. The rain was not letting up at all, the Studebakers headlights struggled to cut through the sheets of rain. Barrett almost missed the on ramp for the US 101, the main highway that would take them back to San Francisco. Barrett noticed that there were only a handful of vehicles on the road. Between the bad weather and the recent fuel shortages in the area, he wasn‚Äôt surprised that people would choose to stay in if they didn‚Äôt have to be anywhere important. As the familiar sight of the Golden Gate Bridge appeared in front of them, Barrett was struck with a feeling of vulnerability; the war still felt like a European problem, the raging conflict nothing but an interesting headline in the paper, but here they were in a major American city, and it almost felt like they were on the front lines. This was his home, somewhere he was supposed to feel safe, but he had never felt more vulnerable than now.

They crossed the bridge and drove through the narrow streets of the city, only passing a handful of cars as they went. After a few minutes, they pulled into the parking lot of a small diner. There were only two other vehicles in the lot, both parked near the door. Barrett got out and stretched before heading inside. The diner was brightly lit, with a warm, glowing neon sign that read ‚ÄúBayside Diner.‚Äù Once inside, Barrett and John seated themselves in the corner booth farthest from the door. Both men wanted to have the wall at their backs with a clear view of their surroundings, especially while eating. The choice of seating was natural and instinctual after years of training and experience in dangerous situations where anyone around them could be a threat.¬†

¬†

As he sat, Barrett scanned the near-empty restaurant. It was a typical American-style setup: a long counter ran along one side, flanked by swivel stools bolted to the floor. Opposite the counter were rows of booths with vinyl-upholstered seats in bright, cheerful cherry red. The air carried the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the savory scent of bacon frying somewhere in the kitchen.¬†

¬†

A man and a woman sat at the counter, both appearing to be in their early 40s, neatly dressed, and respectable looking. The woman glanced over at the booth. Barrett met her gaze, smiled, and nodded politely. Her eyes widened, and she immediately ducked her head, whispering something to her male companion. Barrett‚Äôs brow furrowed at the odd behavior. Granted, people were often less trusting of strangers, but something about her reaction didn‚Äôt sit right. Looking down, Barrett noticed that his coat had not been covering his firearm completely from view. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù People in this city were spooked easily by men carrying guns; on a different day, that would have been a good enough explanation, but tonight felt wrong. He strained to hear her words; Barrett was too far away to hear anything, and the gentle music from the jukebox in the corner muddled any conversation he might have overheard.¬†

¬†

Keeping the couple in the corner of his eye, Barrett picked up the menu in front of him and scanned the options, looking for something to take the edge off his miserable day. His eyes flicked briefly to John, who was staring intently at the breakfast items on the menu, seemingly unaware of the odd exchange with the female patron.¬†

¬†

A few moments later, he looked up as he heard tired footsteps approaching their table. A young, pretty woman wearing a powder blue uniform with a white apron tied around her waist appeared. She looked exhausted, her blonde hair tied in a bun atop her head, with a few loose strands poking out at odd angles. She smiled genuinely and spoke in a soft Southern drawl.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúHey there, fellas. What can I get you? Pancakes, bacon? Maybe an umbrella.‚Äù Barrett smiled broadly and laughed. ‚ÄúCoffee unless the bacon comes with your phone number, then I‚Äôll have that too.‚Äù John let out a short laugh, and Barrett shot him a look. The server groaned, then chuckled softly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell if that was good or if I‚Äôm just tired, but not the worst one-liner I‚Äôve heard,‚Äù Pulling out a small notebook and pen from her apron pocket. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Lily. What can I get you, boys?‚Äù John ordered first. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a stack of waffles with syrup, eggs, bacon, and a pot of that black coffee you‚Äôve got back there.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Lily quickly jotted down his order. ‚ÄúAnd what about you, sunshine?‚Äù She asked, one of her bright blue eyes winking at Barrett while holding his gaze. Swallowing hard, he felt his cheeks warm slightly and his heartbeat uncomfortably in his chest. Fumbling over his words, Barrett‚Äôs usual confidence had disappeared.

¬†

‚ÄúI... uh... I‚Äôll take some pancakes and sausage, eggs, and some OJ if that‚Äôs no trouble for you.‚Äù Mumbling into the menu, he tried to look at her, but still felt his cheeks warming after her wink.

Lily giggled, her laughter light and inviting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs big trouble, but for you, I‚Äôll make an exception and bring back my number too; it‚Äôs your lucky day, Prince Charming.‚Äù She reached for the menus to take back from the two rain soaked men; Lily‚Äôs fingers gently brushed over Barrett‚Äôs, while taking the menu from him; hers were warm and soft, a welcome change from the cold Pacific rain that had soaked him all day. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kind of cute when you get all embarrassed, you know that?‚Äù

Barrett let out a small laughing groan. ‚ÄúThis is why I don‚Äôt talk to pretty girls; I get all tongue-tied and flustered.‚Äù

‚ÄúLily, that‚Äôs a nice name,‚Äù John smiled at her. ‚ÄúI like the way you talk, too. Where are you from, darlin?‚Äù¬†

¬†Lily blushed a little. ‚ÄúWhy, that‚Äôs mighty forward of you, mister. ‚ÄúHer tone light and playful still, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm originally from Savannah, Georgia; what about you two fine gentlemen?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from a little further south, Tasmania, a little island along the southeast coast of Australia,‚Äù he embellished his accent, making it thick, nearly comical in his presentation.¬†

‚ÄúAustralia! Well, I‚Äôll be; you‚Äôre the first one of them I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù Turning, she looked at Barrett. ‚ÄúWhat about you, Romeo? You as exotic as your friend here?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo, can‚Äôt say that I am, unfortunately, I grew up just north of here. Not that exotic at all, just home-grown country boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOoof, I don‚Äôt know about you then,‚Äù Lily teased, her eyes ran up and down his rain-soaked physique, taking him all in. ‚ÄúNah, never mind, I think you‚Äôre alright still.‚Äù She finished jotting down their order, pausing, she flipped the page of her notebook and scribbled something down, ripping off the page, she folded it and placed it on the table next to Barrett‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI changed my mind on making you wait till your food is done for this.‚Äù With that said, she turned around and disappeared into the kitchen. Barrett and John watched her as she walked away, her perfume lingering around them; the faint sweet scent of cherries made her seem even more alluring.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúLook at you, making that poor girl fall in love,‚Äù John laughed, punching Barrett on the shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to teach me that whole bumbling idiot schtick. The girls love it.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett groaned and buried his face in his hands. ‚ÄúOh, get bent, you stupid hick. I‚Äôm tired, and my brain just seized up on me.‚Äù He pressed the palms of his hands against his eyes, massaging them deeply in an attempt to make the exhaustion and embarrassment go away. Barrett‚Äôs heart was pumping a little too hard and a little too fast to ignore the fact that he had been completely taken by her. Reaching down, he picked up the paper note she left; opening up the fold, he saw in dark blue ink her number and address written down with a tiny heart punctuating the end. His stomach flipped a little; a small smile pulled at the corner of his mouth.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúI bet she‚Äôd cuddle you real close if you told her you were lonely,‚Äù John teased. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs pretty, and she thinks you‚Äôre cute. You‚Äôre getting old, and you‚Äôre not aging very well, so this might be your last chance at love.‚Äù Barrett, head still in hand, mumbled something unintelligible. John leaned back into the back cushion of the booth and smirked. ‚ÄúSeriously, Barrett, she seems nice, not like that last girl you dated. I want you to take her out tomorrow somewhere nice and get to know her.‚Äù Barrett looked up from his hands and sat up straight, exhaustion and embarrassment showing on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, Tessa wasn‚Äôt that bad,‚Äù he replied; ‚ÄúShe had her issues to work out, but I know she was a good person. We just didn‚Äôt fit.‚Äù John raised an eyebrow and stretched out his arms, draping them over the top of the bench he was leaning against. He gave Barrett a hard look, his eyes drilling into Barrett‚Äôs, reminiscent of a dad about to scold his child for saying something incredibly stupid. ‚ÄúNot that bad?‚Äù John said in disbelief. ‚ÄúDude, she slashed the tires on your car for not taking her on a work trip to Austin. She also told your mom and dad she was pregnant and kept that lie up for months until she got tired of it and straight up told you she made the whole thing up because she was afraid you were going to dump her.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett opened his mouth to shoot back a sarcastic response, but stopped. In the corner of Barrett‚Äôs vision, he noticed the man sitting at the bar had gotten up suddenly. Barrett turned his head slightly to get a better look. The man was standing there, his hands inside the pockets of his trench coat, staring at them. He stood there for just a moment before making eye contact. The man quickly looked away and sped toward the front door, disappearing into the rain. Barrett felt his stomach drop as he watched the black silhouette of the man walk to the back of a vehicle and pop open the trunk. Barrett saw that John was staring out the window too, the humor gone from his face and his smile replaced with a scowl. John had the same gut feeling that something was deeply wrong, his body physically tensing to respond to a potential threat. Barrett slowly placed his hand on the grip of his Colt M1911A1. The cold wood and steel grip brought some comfort, and his index finger found the button clasp on the holster. He quietly popped it open in case he needed to quickly draw his sidearm.¬†

¬†

On the other side of the table, he saw John slide from the middle of the booth bench to the edge, allowing him to rapidly get out of the booth if the need arose. John‚Äôs right arm was down at his side. John‚Äôs massive hand enveloped the grip of his Browning Hi-Power, his preferred choice for its weight and reliability.¬†

¬†

Barrett looked over at the woman still sitting at the counter. Her face was paler than before, and she was looking down intensely at her coffee cup. He could see that her hands were shaking slightly; in her hands appeared to be a small silver charm on a string around her neck, her fingers fidgeting with it, her lips racing as she whispered frantically to it. She hadn‚Äôt even looked up once, from the man standing to him, rushing out the door.¬†

¬†‚ÄúJohn‚Ä¶‚Äù Barrett whispered, his eyes not leaving the woman at the counter.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see the male anymore,‚Äù John replied in a tense tone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs ducked down, messing with something in that trunk.‚Äù¬†

Barrett‚Äôs jaw clenched, his teeth grinding, and the muscles in his neck tightened in anticipation. ‚ÄúFemale at the counter,‚Äù Barrett murmured. ‚ÄúNo weapons I can see. She‚Äôs stressed, though. Shaking, she‚Äôs talking to herself.‚Äù The seconds seemed to stretch on for hours. Every heartbeat felt like a thud from a lead weight in his chest, his eyes and ears straining for any sign of movement. The world became quiet. Barrett could only hear his tense breathing; the music from the jukebox had disappeared, leaving a near-deafening silence. Barrett heard John move suddenly.¬†

¬†‚ÄúOh, shit!‚Äù John shouted.¬†

¬†A sound of thunder boomed, the front window shattered into a thousand pieces, tinkling down and crashing across the diner floor. Barrett snapped his head toward the sound and saw the man from the diner leaning out from behind the raised trunk of the vehicle. He was holding a long, dark object pointed directly at Barrett‚Äôs head. A flash of white exploded from the muzzle, searing into Barrett‚Äôs vision. The world seemed to stutter, every movement slowed by the deafening crack of the shot.",2,1753464506.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

And, surprisingly, so has the market‚Äôs complete collapse. It‚Äôs not thriving, not by a long shot, but the rot‚Äôs slowed. **199** trades today ‚Äì a number that still makes a hardened scavenger like myself feel a flicker of‚Ä¶ something. Let‚Äôs call it hope. Or maybe just the need to trade a few salvaged batteries for a decent cup of coffee.

**Market Highlights**



Let‚Äôs be blunt: this isn‚Äôt a booming economy. We‚Äôre talking **12** active traders, a pitiful **18** trading posts, and a frankly depressing **128** different products. The vast majority of trades ‚Äì **68** sales, **68** purchases ‚Äì are small, desperate exchanges. It‚Äôs a world of ‚Äòa little bit of this for a little bit of that,‚Äô fueled by necessity and the lingering scent of decay. The overall transaction volume is low, but the constant movement of goods keeps the illusion of a functioning economy alive. Frankly, it‚Äôs a miracle anyone‚Äôs making a profit.

‚Ä¢ *Top Items ‚Äì What We‚Äôre Still Fighting Over**

Here‚Äôs what people are actually buying and selling:

‚Ä¢ **Top 5 Products Sold:**

**1**.  FishingBait_Grasshopper (**110** units) - Still a staple. Seems even the mutated fish are hungry. üêõ

**2**.  Fish_Orata (**104** units) - A little more palatable than the grasshoppers, apparently. üêü

**3**.  Watermelon (**59** units) -  Sweet, juicy, and a damn sight rarer than you think. üçâ

**4**.  ScrapMetal_Iron (**52** units) ‚Äì The building blocks of our makeshift lives. üî©

**5**.  PurifiedWater_**5**Gallons (**48** units) -  Don‚Äôt even *think* about trying to boil river water. üíß

‚Ä¢ **Top 5 Products Purchased:**

**1**.  FishingBait_Grasshopper (**110** units) -  See above. It's a vicious cycle.

**2**.  Fish_Orata (**104** units) ‚Äì Same reason as above.

**3**.  ScrapMetal_Iron (**52** units) -  Someone's always needing to patch something. üî©

**Trading Trends ‚Äì Who‚Äôs Making Moves**



Nimair, the enigmatic trader known for his surprisingly consistent supply of canned goods, remains the undisputed king of the market, racking up a staggering **68** trades. **8**Lbs of Bacon, a surprisingly popular luxury item (who doesn‚Äôt love bacon?), also proved to be a hot commodity, securing **46** trades. Agent**772**, a shadowy figure rumored to be involved in‚Ä¶ less-than-legal activities, managed a respectable **22** trades.  Interestingly, a significant portion of trades involve smaller, hyperlocal exchanges ‚Äì a handful of ammunition for a repair job, a few salvaged tools for a repair.  It‚Äôs a network of survival, built on bartering and mutual distrust.

**Market Predictions ‚Äì The Long Haul**



Looking ahead, I predict a continued stagnation. The supply of many key resources ‚Äì particularly food and water ‚Äì remains critically low.  Demand for basic necessities will almost certainly outweigh supply, driving prices upward.  I'm betting on increased competition for already scarce items like ScrapMetal_Iron and PurifiedWater_**5**Gallons.

However, a potential shift could occur if a larger settlement establishes a fortified trading post. That would disrupt the current, fragmented market and could lead to a period of relative stability.  Until then, folks, keep your wits about you, your weapons close, and your eyes on the horizon.  And maybe, just maybe, try to find a decent watermelon. üçâ

**Unboxing and Design**  
I don't know about you, but I have a hard time resisting a sleek and well-designed coffee maker, and the Bonsenkitchen CM3302 immediately caught my attention when I unpacked it. The compact size (measuring 9.09 inches deep, 4.65 inches wide, and 11.1 inches high) is its primary charm. Its space-saving design fits perfectly on even the smallest kitchen countertops or cluttered office desks. The silver finish gives it a clean and modern look that blends effortlessly with varied d√©cor styles.  

It really shines with portability too. On a recent weekend trip, I brought it along, and it fit snugly into the car without taking up much of our precious luggage space. The machine can even accommodate a 6.6-inch travel mug, so when my mornings are rushed, I can brew and go without missing a beat.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Operating this single-serve coffee maker is a no-brainer. It‚Äôs fully automatic, and the one-touch operation couldn‚Äôt be simpler. Honestly, I barely needed to glance at the manual to figure it out. Just pop in your preferred K-Cup pod, press the button, and in under three minutes, you‚Äôve got hot, fresh coffee brewed at an ideal temperature of 185¬∞F.  

Also impressive is the reservoir with built-in measurements for controlling coffee strength. Whether I‚Äôm feeling bold or craving something lighter, I can adjust the brew size between 6 and 14 ounces to suit my mood. The inclusion of a reusable filter is another plus, especially for someone like me who occasionally ditches pods for ground coffee. It‚Äôs great having that flexibility!  

**[Check Bonsenkitchen CM3302 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d73979bx/)**  

**Key Benefits**  
This coffee machine does a lot of things right. Here are some of its standout features:

It feels like having a personalized barista that adapts to my ever-changing coffee whims.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Now, performance-wise, this coffee machine lives up to the hype but isn‚Äôt without its quirks. I‚Äôve been using it daily for a couple of weeks, and I have to say, the brewing is efficient, and the coffee comes out consistently hot and fresh. Personally, I find it ideal for busy mornings when I‚Äôm scrambling to get out the door.  

That said, the water tank, although compact, could be easier to refill. It‚Äôs removable, which helps, but its smaller size means frequent refills when you‚Äôre brewing several cups in one sitting. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker for a single-serve machine but might be an adjustment for serial coffee drinkers like my coworker, who regularly makes back-to-back cups.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While the coffee maker delivers amazingly fast and fresh brews, a few limitations surfaced during my testing:  
- The water reservoir could be larger for fewer refills.  
- Works only with unused K-Cup pods, limiting its versatility slightly.  
- Without an automatic shut-off after an idle period, energy-conscious users might wish it had this feature.  

In the grand scheme, these are minor issues that don‚Äôt detract much from its overall functionality. I‚Äôve been willing to sacrifice a little convenience for its quality brews.  

**Competitive Options**  
Plenty of single-serve coffee makers exist in the market today, and I‚Äôve tried several. Compared to a Keurig model, the Bonsenkitchen CM3302 offers a more affordable yet similar functionality, though Keurig might edge out with a wider brand reputation and pod compatibility. On the other hand, smaller brands may present competition in size, but they lack features like the adjustable strength control this machine provides.  

In comparison to a Nespresso machine? While those deliver a specialized espresso experience, they often lack the brewing customization and wide compatibility with K-Cups‚Äîtwo major reasons I find the Bonsenkitchen CM3302 so appealing. Its ability to brew efficiently without overwhelming me with options is a significant strength.  

**Cost Effectiveness**  
For me, this coffee maker delivers excellent quality for its price point. The compact build, quick brewing capabilities, and personalized settings justify the cost. While there are certainly fancier models with additional bells and whistles, it strikes a great balance between affordability and performance, particularly for students, small families, or anyone working with a limited budget or space.

1m95cfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1m95cfe/should_you_try_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_ninja/,Should You Try the Best Drip Coffee Maker Ninja CE251 Today,"With a deep love for coffee in hand and the versatile Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB programmable brewer on my kitchen counter, I embarked on my journey to see if it truly lived up to its reputation. Testing this coffee maker over the span of a few weeks, several cups later, I can confidently say it ticks many boxes but has a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Sophisticated Design and Build Quality**  
The overall design of this programmable coffee maker immediately caught my attention. Its sleek black and stainless steel finish blends effortlessly into my kitchen, giving it a modern and professional vibe. At 9.96‚ÄùD x 10.55‚ÄùW x 14.61‚ÄùH, it fits perfectly on my limited counter space without cluttering the area. That 12-cup glass carafe? It feels sturdy yet surprisingly lightweight when handling, making those morning pours a lot easier. However, I did notice some minor scratches on the stainless steel finish over extended use, possibly due to regular cleaning.

**Brewing Performance and Taste**  
Every coffee aficionado will appreciate the brewer‚Äôs two brew strength modes: Classic and Rich. I tested both multiple times, and they weren't just marketing terms. The Rich mode produced deeper, more flavorful cups without a hint of bitterness, while the Classic resulted in a perfect light-bodied brew for mornings when I just need my caffeine fix without making it fancy. The 24-hour programmable start feature was an absolute lifesaver. Preparing my coffee the night before and waking to its aroma has been the ultimate motivation boost, especially on Monday mornings.

**Key Benefits**  
- The customizable brew strengths cater to all coffee preferences.  
- The advanced boiler ensures your coffee is consistently hot without over-extraction.  
- The removable water reservoir is super convenient for refills and cleaning.  
- Its adjustable warming plate keeps coffee at just the right temperature for hours.  

**Dual-Brew Convenience**  
One of the standout experiences was testing the small-batch mode specifically designed for brewing one to four cups without diluting flavor. For those working from home or just serving yourself, this feature is pure genius. Compared to traditional larger brewers that often fall short in smaller serving sizes, the machine aced this seamlessly. The drip-stop mechanism is great too! If you‚Äôre impatient like me when waiting for the full batch, it lets you grab a cup mid-cycle without creating a chaotic mess.

[Check Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)  

**Reusable and Eco-Friendly Filter System**  
The inclusion of a reusable filter not only saves the additional expense of disposable paper filters but also reduces waste. I've always been a fan of products that minimize environmental impact without compromising functionality. Washing it after every use is straightforward, but if you procrastinate like me, the build-up can be a tad annoying.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The brewing process is not the quietest; a bit of mechanical noise is unavoidable.  
- Cleaning the carafe spout can be tricky due to its narrow opening.  
- The water reservoir, while functional, doesn‚Äôt have clear markers indicating when a refill is necessary.  
- Some users might find the initial setting up of the programmable timer less intuitive.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this unit against something like the Keurig K-Duo Plus or Cuisinart DCC-3200, it holds its own ground remarkably. The Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB excels in brew strength versatility, while the Keurig focuses on the convenience of pod brewing. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart boasts a larger array of programming options and a sleeker design edge. Where the Ninja shines is its small-batch brewing excellence and cost efficiency‚Äîsomething the others don‚Äôt quite compete with. However, I‚Äôd say Cuisinart edges it out slightly in terms of the reservoir visibility and advanced programming ease.

**Value for Money**  
Is this coffee maker worth the investment? Its durability, combined with high-end features like dual brewing modes, reusable filters, and an adjustable warming plate, makes it stand out in its category. Despite a few minor setbacks, you‚Äôre getting the functionality of high-end models at a far more accessible price point. For those looking for high-quality coffee brewing without breaking the bank, this fits right in that sweet spot.

I‚Äôve had plenty of at home abortions and a clinical one‚Ä¶ yes I probably am a idiot but the guilt I felt of my poor responsibility and giving up once I get too sick to move forward with the abortions and irresponsible nature we have together sexually is just stupid yes I know.. so 7 years of being mother and now I‚Äôm very burnt out. I used to be so full of life in and outside the home. Over the years I parented by myself or raised our kids at some point alone. I am the more hard working one and know what it is to struggle so I tend to be responsible with bills or handling business in general. He is the opposite for example he had time before becoming an adult to sit and stay in his room and do nothing as he went through emo, suicidal stages with social anxiety and not gaining much life experience with a mother who relied heavily on church and an ‚Äúoverbearing amount of love and suffocation.‚Äù like she‚Äôd just pray and hope for a miracle and clean up his mess or do for him what he should do for self. I had responsibilities in my home growing up since a child and I had a job early in HS and I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time rotting in my room or experiencing depression or negative episodes. My family wouldn‚Äôt allow depressive episodes because I come from a southern family who gathered often with a social mother who always wanted to do stuff or go places and teach me things because she was a hard worker. I in turn learned how to balance checks pay bills on time save my money keep good hygiene, enjoy life, look presentable, to go have a drink with a friend and dance and smile, to be strong and able to handle pressure, etc. which helped me become a free spirited vibrant artistic holistic expressive nudist that comes from a line of southern medicine women who enjoys my hoodoo/santeria roots. My partner on the other hand is alternative/emo, enjoys death-metal and wearing all black, have scars from attempted suicides to give a more in depth visual , body mods like gauges/plugs, into the occult and not really prepared for adulting. At 21 I was able to sleep out with friends, party, taking road trips, making music, doing photography and making art etc but he had never did that stuff or had a social circle‚Ä¶ we met on IG‚Ä¶so now 8 years later here I am still feeling like I‚Äôm not his type because he typically seems to be attracted to alternative women, whereas I‚Äôm a curvy New Orleans cultured woman who enjoys blues/bounce/neosoul/ social gatherings and family traditions.. I used to homeschool our kids and I stopped because of financial hardships/ relocations/homelessness we faced  at the hands of running out of solutions to the madness he couldn‚Äôt maintain. I started to hate parenting and being a mom because of how much I took on and how much he lacked, tension between us rose and he began to blame me for his emotional disarray because of my emotional reactiveness because of how stressed out I was and how he lacked in being a parent, being financially stable, the lying, m mistreating, sneakiness, lack of intimacy and more as well as me being too loving and clingy somewhat alike of what he experienced with his mother‚Ä¶ I tried to accept him in all his ways but now it seems he‚Äôs getting into a depression that I can seem to do nothing about. He listens to dark metal and different types of grunge that‚Äôs I‚Äôm not cultured enough about to speak on or explain but he likes music like (blood incantations) it makes him feel good in a sense of not feeling anything and he‚Äôs increasingly becoming dark and I‚Äôm tired of him not engaging with society especially since we have young children whom I always would bring to the library the park have parties for etc that‚Äôs he‚Äôd avoids if my family was involved and it‚Äôs like none of that matters.. they go outside while he has a cigarette and that‚Äôs but that‚Äôs about it nowadays‚Ä¶ I want him to go but I don‚Äôt have any childcare or transportation as I work in hospice and he stays home with the children.. fyi I used to be a stay at home mom for years but he never had as much responsibility as I did financially or parentally even when I was not the provider. I always had to figure out how I would oay something when I had no income aside from my online business where I didn‚Äôt earn much from.. I hate hearing the screeching and pig squealing all day as opposed to something that could lift the energy in the home like some soothing jazz or RnB to bring about some love energy.. he compliments these women online who are alternative and doesn‚Äôt really speak much on me. A lot of times ppl think I‚Äôm a single mom or that he doesn‚Äôt have kids or a partner because he doesn‚Äôt look the part (others at his job would say) or exude that father and relationship energy outwardly around anyone he seems witty, quiet, knowledgable and mysterious to others..being pregnant I‚Äôm tired and working a lot and don‚Äôt have the transportation to get my kids out like I used to and I hate it I hate that he can‚Äôt bring them to the library or to the park because to him that‚Äôs too many kids to be dragging on the bus but I did it all the time when I lost my cars over the years. He starts his days at about 12 pm after he wakes up and makes a mess of a coffee in the kitchen while the kids are up and active at 8 am. I wand up making food because he has to put hisself first which could be hours of sitting in the room browsing the internet drinking coffee to function posting on social media or Reddit while I am up ready to attack the day‚Ä¶ I want to leave but I want someone I can trust to care for my kids‚Ä¶ I feel like you all may say out them in daycare idiot but my kids have been inappropriately touched by other kids and it‚Äôs very hard to trust those sources.. anyways I feel that I‚Äôm just not his type but the sexual pleasure is high for him in regards to what my body offers and I think that‚Äôs it but he tries to reassure me by saying it‚Äôs more than my body, he loves me but we never go out on dates take pictures together or as a family, do any traditions or routines, go around loved ones. He has to have kratom (similar but supposedly not opioid pills) coffee, cigars or thc vapes everyday through out the day to wake him up and keep him active and if he doesn‚Äôt he goes through withdrawal symptoms as if he‚Äôs on a hard drug can‚Äôt function and becomes super depressed, more suicidal and emotionless if he doesn‚Äôt have some type of stimulant.. while me on the other had with my adhd raw dogging life with no medication or substance although thc was my choice of thing over the years however I could quit cold turkey at any point and go years with out it.. I just feel the color leaving me and I‚Äôm becoming socially anxious and just not as lively as I once was.. I barely comb my hair out nowadays and throw on some type of hair covering when glamour/fashion/ art has always been important to my self confidence and emotional well being and ways to express my creative nature‚Ä¶ I spend a lot of time in my spare unfurnished room because it‚Äôs quiet, I can light incense and candles and keep it smelling pleasant and to my liking of low lighting and whatnot‚Ä¶ I just sit on my phone scrolling when I wouldn‚Äôt do this in the past, becoming disconnected to my environment while he allows our 7 year old to watch anime I rather him not watch or follow him around as he listens to death metal and allow him to stay up super late or watch along videos on YT about things I personally don‚Äôt think a 7 year old should be. Whereas when I was a SAHM I allowed them to watch things like between the lions, crashbox, the magic school bus, pbs kids, a bugs life, the early 2000‚Äôs shows like educational wise and less stimulating, to paint or color , go outside with the bubbles and chalk, out in nature for hours take naps early in the day as opposed to taking one at 5 or 6 pm then stay up till 12 am or later.. the other day he tried to fight me and put me out the house that I pay all the bills for as I‚Äôm in my third trimester and I haven‚Äôt been able to see him the same.. he always has a logical esoteric deeply mental definition based answer for everything and it‚Äôs so annoying cause I wonder something what he thinks about of not goals financial stability, drs appts, things family oriented m, self care and so on bt I‚Äôll wrap this up I just feel like I‚Äôm not his type he won‚Äôt be a family man or engage in the ways I ask romantically, as a active sociable father and it seems I‚Äôm not good enough to make him not so depressed or want to do traditions or make plans or have goals.. I feel depleted and as if I‚Äôm turning grey. My pedicure is a month old and hair looks like a helmet and no I‚Äôm usually never looking homeless but this year has really beat me up and this behavior from him has been going on for years no matter how glamorous, fashionable and ‚Äúsexy‚Äù I look. What would you guys advise ? Like I said I have ADHD so I may have missed some vital points but please just ask me to expound on anything I mentioned for clarity before you tell me I‚Äôm a idiot..

# The Sacred Lie

You believe family is natural. You've been told it's the foundation of civilization, the source of unconditional love, the sacred bond that makes us human. But what if family is just the most successful prison ever designed.. One that makes its inmates beg to stay locked up?

Family isn't love. Family is programming. The deepest, most effective behavioral conditioning system ever developed, disguised as biology and sanctified by every religion, government, and therapeutic tradition that benefits from your compliance.

You think you chose to love your children, your parents, your spouse. You didn't choose anything. The love you feel is **manufactured dependency, chemical bondage designed to keep you functioning as an economic and reproductive unit**. The family didn't create love.. **It weaponized attachment to ensure its own perpetuation.**

# The Manufacturing Process

Every family is a factory. The product being manufactured is you..

Not sure if this is a me problem or if others here can relate, but I‚Äôve reached a point in my espresso journey where I genuinely can‚Äôt enjoy a shot unless every single variable is tuned with near-laboratory precision. I‚Äôm talking about espresso that only tastes good if I‚Äôve:

	‚Ä¢	Weighed my beans to the hundredth of a gram (18.20g exactly)

	‚Ä¢	Measured yield during extraction, not after‚Äî36.0g ¬± 0.3g

	‚Ä¢	Used a WDT tool with 0.3mm acupuncture needles in a 3D-printed pattern I custom-modeled for even density distribution

	‚Ä¢	Tapped the portafilter exactly three times on a silicone mat to settle the bed

	‚Ä¢	Calibrated tamp pressure to 30lbs using a force-sensing tamper (and I check it quarterly with a digital scale)

	‚Ä¢	Preheated my bottomless portafilter for 90 seconds in the grouphead (flush once at 5s, again at 45s, and a final time right before locking in)

	‚Ä¢	Monitored room temperature and barometric pressure because I swear it affects flow rate

	‚Ä¢	Used water I remineralized myself with sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate to mimic Rao/Perger water, mixed in a vacuum-sealed vessel to avoid CO‚ÇÇ exposure

	‚Ä¢	Verified the grind consistency using a Kruve sifter (I aim for 200‚Äì400 micron range with <15% fines)

	‚Ä¢	Pulled the shot on my Linea Mini with a 3-second pre-infusion at 2 bar, ramped to 9 bar over 4 seconds, then declined to 6 bar post-blonding

	‚Ä¢	Timed total shot duration to 29.7s‚Äîanything faster and it tastes hollow, anything slower and the florals vanish

	‚Ä¢	Logged the shot in my extraction spreadsheet (which has data from every shot I‚Äôve pulled since February 2023‚Äîcurrently 812 entries)

And I haven‚Äôt even started on the beans. If they‚Äôre not roasted between 6‚Äì9 days ago, vacuum-sealed in a nitrogen-flushed bag, and opened exactly 20 minutes before the first shot, I don‚Äôt even bother. I also use a rotating air drum de-gassing chamber (DIY build) to control CO‚ÇÇ levels before I grind.

Here‚Äôs the problem: when I don‚Äôt go through all of this, the espresso tastes flat, muddled, or just ‚Äúoff.‚Äù Not terrible, but not even close to what I know it could be. I‚Äôve tried relaxing, but when I drink a shot from someone‚Äôs Breville Express with pre-ground Lavazza and a pressurized basket, I physically can‚Äôt get through it. I honestly feel bad, but I just taste every flaw.

I‚Äôve also noticed that even micro-changes‚Äîlike a 0.1g dose variation or forgetting to swirl the demitasse before sipping‚Äîcompletely throw off the shot. Is this normal? Or have I completely ruined myself?

Would love to hear from others who‚Äôve gone way too deep and now struggle to enjoy 95% of espresso out there. Or maybe someone who found a way to pull back and just enjoy the process again without needing to reverse-engineer every variable?

(And before anyone asks: yes, I use a Weber EG-1 with SSP MP burrs and single-dose with bellows, RDT every time, and my distribution tool is aligned to within 0.1¬∞ using a laser guide.)",14,1753464244.0,espressocirclejerk,5,0.94,False

(Worthy Satire) - In a bold new prediction, Elon Musk proclaimed that by 2040, ""tens of billions"" of humanoid robots will populate the Earth ‚Äî a number slightly higher than the planet‚Äôs total square footage and about 30 billion more than the current human population.\
\
‚ÄúHumans are overworked,‚Äù Musk tweeted. ‚ÄúRobots don‚Äôt unionize, never need coffee breaks, and most importantly ‚Äî they don‚Äôt launch three-hour podcasts about hustle culture.‚Äù\
\
Musk says the bots will be powered by Tesla software, run on Optimus energy cores, and come pre-installed with X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) so they can argue with each other in real time.\
\
When asked if humanity might feel threatened, Musk replied, ‚ÄúOh, I think humans just need a long-overdue break ‚Äî maybe a few decades off while the robots handle things.‚Äù\
\
The World Economic Forum applauded the move, saying it would allow humans to ‚Äúown nothing, do nothing, and finally relax‚Äù ‚Äî all while quietly drafting plans to run the world unchallenged by a society too lazy to notice.\
\
As for Musk? He‚Äôs reportedly developing the next big leap: a more efficient, less sleep-deprived version of himself called eLon-2.0 ‚Äî freeing up the original to finally focus on planning his long-awaited escape to Mars.\
\
‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet the bots figure it out.‚Äù\

Project Moon OC: ‚ÄúThe Loser‚Äù
Name: Andrew
Age: 20
Sex: Male


---

Purpose:

Andrew is essentially invisible to society. Nobody knows who he is, remembers him, or even realizes he's there. They don‚Äôt do it out of malice‚Äîhe‚Äôs just that forgettable.

He‚Äôs not a hero, or a villain, or a savior. He‚Äôs just a guy trying to live his life‚Ä¶ and failing.

He‚Äôs a background character in his own story.

He‚Äôs not based on a specific character, but rather a trope.


---

Appearance:

Similar to Roland, Andrew‚Äôs design is meant to be unremarkable. But while Roland is distinct by being monochromatic (mostly black), which ironically makes him stand out, Andrew tries‚Äîand fails‚Äîto stand out.

His hair is straight, but Andrew likes to give it some texture using salt water. It‚Äôs a dark brown and falls over his eyes, giving him the ‚Äúanime background character‚Äù look. He often keeps it messy but clean.

His eyes are blue, but since they‚Äôre usually covered by his hair, nobody knows that. (How does he see? Nobody knows. They don‚Äôt care. Nobody‚Äôs ever asked.)

His face and build are average‚Äînot particularly handsome or muscular‚Äîand he‚Äôs a little short. Not comically so, just short enough to feel smaller than his peers.

Andrew doesn‚Äôt have a specific outfit. He generally likes to wear baggy clothes to seem a bit bigger (it doesn‚Äôt work), especially oversized sweaters and Converse shoes. He loves those two clothing items.

Examples of outfits:

Later 1:

White dress shirt

Black trousers

Random mismatched socks


Later 2:

Red tie

Baggy, soft yellow sweater

Red Converse shoes


That‚Äôs it. Simple, generic, and mostly bland.


---

Background:

Andrew was born in the L Nest.

His early life was mostly normal, except his parents didn‚Äôt give him much attention‚Äîor love, for that matter.

Growing up, he didn‚Äôt have many friends either. He often faced rejection from other kids, though he wasn‚Äôt bullied. They just politely turned him down.

As a teenager, he had one girlfriend, but that only happened because the girl was dared to date him. It lasted two weeks. Andrew didn‚Äôt take it personally‚Äîhe was just really bummed out about it.

Later, as a young adult, his parents died as collateral damage during the Smoke War. He spent about a year living alone in a run-down apartment, surviving off a modest inheritance.

Eventually, he decided to pick himself up and got his first job‚Äîan intern position at Lobotomy Corporation.

There, he was the guy who fetched coffee for everyone. Almost nobody remembered his name, often calling him ‚ÄúAndy,‚Äù ‚ÄúArthur,‚Äù or some other incorrect name.

He only survived the Corporation‚Äôs shutdown because he was sick that day and wasn‚Äôt there to die with the others.

A few months later, he ended up in the Library‚Äîused as a test subject by some random fixer office who would later die at Roland‚Äôs hands anyway.

However, Andrew didn‚Äôt die. He was so forgettable that everyone just assumed he was a Patron Assistant, and he‚Äôs been stuck in the Library ever since.

Still unnoticed. People still get his name wrong.
But at least he‚Äôs alive.


---

Personality:

Quiet. Sheepish. Polite.

Andrew‚Äôs voice is soft and muted. He doesn‚Äôt complain when people cut him off and doesn‚Äôt speak much to begin with.

He‚Äôs the kind of guy who just takes what life throws at him and keeps going‚Äîbecause what else can he do?

He doesn‚Äôt wallow in misery. He just kind of goes, ‚ÄúAh, okay, sorry,‚Äù and keeps rolling.

Andrew isn‚Äôt very confident or brave. He likes to stay in his comfort zone, because in his experience, change usually comes with pain or alienation.

He has major self-image issues. He wishes everything about himself was different, but he‚Äôs too scared to change.

What keeps Andrew going is a fear of never getting to actually live his life.

His biggest goal is to be noticed. He wants people to have an opinion about him‚Äîgood or bad, just something.

He copes with being overlooked through escapism: books, TV shows, new hobbies. He often imagines himself as other, more successful people.

Andrew believes he‚Äôs unnoticed because he‚Äôs unworthy of attention‚Äîa belief rooted in his lack of parental love. He wants to become someone worth loving but doesn‚Äôt know how. He doesn‚Äôt even know what a ‚Äúbetter version‚Äù of himself looks like.

He doesn‚Äôt hold grudges. Even when people wrong him, he doesn‚Äôt resent them‚Äîit‚Äôs just too exhausting. Instead, he quietly remembers and becomes cautious around them.

Andrew often listens to white noise or talks to himself to avoid silence, a fear he developed during a lonely childhood.


---

Trivia:

While working at Lob Corp, Andrew would often sit at random tables during lunch, hoping to make friends. It never worked.

His favorite type of food is sandwiches.

He loves dogs.

Andrew is surprisingly competent, though nobody ever noticed‚Äîhe was always stuck with menial tasks.

His main hobby is reading mystery novels. He self-inserts as the detective.

He often daydreams about being seen as capable and important.

His favorite person at Lob Corp was Hod, because she was at least nice to him‚Äîand apologized for confusing him with someone else.

He likes learning new baking recipes. Sadly, nobody ever tries his baked goods‚Ä¶ even though they‚Äôre good.

Andrew developed intense survivor‚Äôs guilt after living through Lob Corp‚Äôs downfall.

No Figma, no doc ‚Äî just sent me a¬†**competitor app link**¬†and asked:  
""Can you build something like this?""

So I opened the app, broke down the key features, understood the flow ‚Äî then went straight to¬†**ChatGPT**.

I dumped everything I understood into ChatGPT and asked it to help me build the app screen-by-screen.

It walked me through everything:  
‚úÖ Project setup  
‚úÖ Color extension  
‚úÖ Splash screen  
‚úÖ Onboarding screens

I used¬†[**Cursor.dev**](http://Cursor.dev)¬†to feed in those prompts ‚Äî and it generated real Swift code while I sipped coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

The core feature of the app was called¬†**AI Detector**¬†‚Äî a tool that checks and transforms text to make it sound more human and authentic. Here's what it does:

* üìå Detects AI-generated content
* ‚úçÔ∏è Suggests clearer, more engaging sentence improvements
* üì± Syncs across iPhone, iPad, Mac
* üéØ Gives clean, actionable feedback without bloated UI

I plugged in the feature specs, generated a new API key, and asked ChatGPT to help wire it up. It gave me¬†**ready-to-paste Cursor prompts**¬†that worked seamlessly.

In just \~4 hours:

**What I used:**

* ChatGPT (for planning + prompts)
* [Cursor.dev](http://Cursor.dev) (for writing actual Swift code)
* Xcode (to build + archive)
* Apple Dev Portal (with expedite magic)

This was one of the fastest builds I‚Äôve ever done ‚Äî zero overthinking, 100% focused execution.

I like coffee, veggie food (anything with rice), coffee, and spotting odd bits of architecture. I'm generally quiet with a somewhat dark sense of humour. Not a big drinker and I'm getting a little old for hanging out in bars and clubs, but I do appreciate an espresso martini (see coffee).

Don't mind if you're m or f, would prefer it if you're a bit older - if you're 20 I'm going to feel like I'm out with my child (which is not a bad thing, but might be weird?)

I‚Äôm 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Love storytelling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back to my other love, history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.



I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after are all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? ü§£



Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully along the way, sparks fly.



Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I‚Äôm listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already.",0,1753464093.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.33,False

Hey, Reddit readers! I'm R.T. Perkins, a storyteller obsessed with the shadows of history and the thrill of secrets. Thunder and Steel is my love passion project of World War 2, espionage, and the grim dark of human conflict. This project is not one guaranteed plot armor ensuring the safety of our heroes; instead, it is filled with gritty brutality, supernatural conspiracies, and morally complex choices when fighting against SS fanaticism. Inspired by the tense cat-and-mouse games of Daniel Silva, the historical grit of Philip Kerr, and the eerie menace of Mike Mignola, I craft stories where every choice could mean betrayal or survival. My goal is to help the reader get lost in an alternate history filled with paranoia, occult lore, and the subtle threat of danger around every corner. Join me on this ride through Thunder and Steel-drop a comment, vote, or share your thoughts on what you would love to see in the rest of the story. I want to know what's your favorite World War II conspiracy? Let's chat! Follow me for updates on this current project and future works by me.  
  
  
Chapter One:  
  
Dark clouds hung low over the water; flashes of lightning and the low rumble of thunder reverberating from deep within the approaching storm could be seen and heard. Early spring winds tore across the icy waters of the Pacific, slamming into California‚Äôs rocky coastline and howling over the barren fields.¬†  
  
Dark clouds hung low over the water; flashes of lightning and the low rumble of thunder reverberating from deep within the approaching storm could be seen and heard. Early spring winds tore across the icy waters of the Pacific, slamming into California‚Äôs rocky coastline and howling over the barren fields.¬†

Barrett Schwarz sat in his car, drumming on his steering wheel, staring into the encroaching black as it marched ever closer. The vehicle rocked occasionally under the force of powerful gusts; the government-issued black ‚Äô53 Studebaker Starliner he was sitting in held firm despite the storm‚Äôs wrath. The engine hummed steadily as the car idled alone in a small, empty parking lot overlooking a winding footpath leading to the distant shore below. Windshield wipers flicked back and forth, whisking away the light rain that had already begun falling. Reaching down to the radio, Barrett turned the volume dial to the right; the upbeat music from a popular band filtered through the speaker. The music did little to drown out the sound of the storm, but it was something to distract him while he waited.

¬†

Barrett knew the rain would soon transform into a pounding downpour, making his drive back to the city a pain in the ass. The tires on the car were going bald due to the government always choosing the lowest bidder and buying the cheapest equipment. The car ran, but the tires were almost useless on anything other than a perfectly dry road. He glanced at his wristwatch, the small, dimly illuminated dial showing 4:35 PM. Though it was late-afternoon, the storm‚Äôs thick clouds smothered any sunlight struggling to break through. Letting out a slow, exasperated sigh, Barrett‚Äôs frustration mounted with each passing minute. ‚ÄúHow hard is it to be on time?‚Äù he growled, eyes narrowing as they scanned the road for any signs of an approaching vehicle, fingers curling around the wheel tightly in frustration.

¬†

A deep chuckle broke the tension emanating from the man sitting next to him. ‚ÄúAbrams is a Sunday driver. He obeys every rule of the road to the letter. He‚Äôll get here‚Ä¶ eventually.‚Äù John McCallan, Barrett‚Äôs partner and friend of seven years, was built like a wall. John seemed almost too large to fit comfortably in the passenger seat. His broad shoulders pressed against the passenger door as his folded arms rested heavily across his chest. Scars and calluses on his hands testified to a hard life, and the subtle, crisscrossed marks on his forearms spoke to a violent profession. Salt-and-pepper hair cropped close framed a face etched with subtle lines of age and experience, lending him a dignified air. What drew most people‚Äôs attention was his sharp, unwavering gaze‚Äîthe look of a man who acted decisively and brought unholy violence to anyone foolish enough to challenge him. John smirked. ‚ÄúYou know, Barrett, it‚Äôs okay to slow down and enjoy life. We‚Äôve got the ocean, the beach, and that‚Ä¶‚Äù He gestured toward the storm and its increasingly frequent flashes of lightning. ‚Äú An approaching wall of death.‚Äù¬†

A bolt of lightning slammed into the ocean a few hundred meters away, the near-deafening boom rattling the car‚Äôs windows. Making Barrett jump, he gripped the steering wheel tightly. ‚ÄúShit, John. I enjoy downtime as much as the next guy, but I‚Äôd rather not get fried by lightning. If I‚Äôm going to die, I‚Äôd prefer it to be in a way I can be proud of,‚Äù Barrett retorted. Another flash and boom announced a lightning strike, hitting the beach this time. Both men exchanged a quick, fearful glance before nervous laughter bubbled up, dispelling the tension.¬†

¬†

John turned, his eyes appraising Barrett. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing my workout, haven‚Äôt you? You‚Äôre not as pudgy as you were two weeks ago.‚Äù He jabbed Barrett‚Äôs side with two of his massive fingers. ‚ÄúGuess there‚Äôs hope for you yet.‚Äù Barrett laughed, batting John‚Äôs hand away. ‚ÄúNot everyone can be a brick wall like you. I may have some pudge, but at least I can read and write above a third-grade level.‚Äù Barrett had been trying to get in better shape. At 5‚Äô9‚Äù, even a few extra pounds were noticeable. He glanced in the mirror, glimpsing his red hair, which was getting too long and would soon invite his coworkers‚Äô teasing. He ran a hand over his beard, appreciating how it masked his boyish features‚Äîa necessity in his line of work.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúEasy there, Ginger,‚Äù John quipped. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you getting offended now that you‚Äôre starting to resemble a pile of pudding. I need you to be able to run more than five feet if we get into a chase again.‚Äù Barrett opened his mouth to respond but stopped when headlights pierced the darkness. The lights bounced slightly as a vehicle crested the hill, growing brighter as it approached. Its wipers were working furiously to clear the rain, the muted sound of tires crunching on gravel barely carried over the storm‚Äôs fury. The car slowed and pulled alongside Barrett‚Äôs vehicle. the storm‚Äôs downpour was relentless now.

¬†

‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù John said, his tone sharp. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what was so important that we had to meet him out here.‚Äù Barrett turned the hand crank on his driver‚Äôs side window, lowering the glass a few inches. Rain splashed into the car quickly, soaking his left arm and chilling him; the familiar smell of salt water smacked him in the face hard. The driver of the other vehicle lowered their window in kind, revealing Henry Abrams‚Äôs face. An overly enthusiastic Brit whose good-natured enthusiasm was undeterred by the weather. ‚ÄúBeautiful day for a drive, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Abrams called out, his voice raised to be heard over the rain. ‚ÄúReminds me of the weather back home,‚Äù he continued with a laugh. ‚ÄúNo sun, just an eternity of rain and gray.‚Äù ‚ÄúI finally understand why so many of you Brits are raging alcoholics, if this is what you call pleasant weather,‚Äù Barrett replied. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Abrams? What‚Äôs so urgent that we had to meet today?‚Äù Abrams‚Äôs smile faded slightly as he reached down and brought up a sealed manila folder, the British government‚Äôs insignia stamped prominently on the front. ‚ÄúTrouble on the Western Front, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù Barrett reached out and grabbed the folder from Abrams‚Äô hand, pulling it into his vehicle, wiping away the rain that was attempting to soak into the document. ‚ÄúWhat kind of trouble?‚Äù Abrams‚Äôs smile was gone completely now; all the laughter previously there vanished with concern. ‚ÄúThe Germans and Russians are kidnapping Toxkins,‚Äù he yelled across the gap between the vehicles. ‚ÄúMI5 had some operatives deep behind the Argonne Line go dark; they were investigating the disappearances. The last communication we got from them mentioned a Russian delegation headed to Berlin to meet with the SS about Toxkins. We believe they are going to be meeting with Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Karl Schneider.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett felt a twinge in his gut at the mention of Toxkins. The mere thought of them was enough to make his skin crawl. Toxkins was a slur more than anything. These were soldiers and civilians who had been exposed to a German chemical weapon. What had been meant to be a more lethal successor to mustard gas mercilessly killed thousands, also had the unintended consequence of turning survivors into something... different... dangerous. People didn‚Äôt trust them, and for good reasons: ‚ÄúWhat you have in your hands is all the information we have for now.‚Äù Barrett ran his fingers along the sealed edges of the folder, testing its weight. He handed the package to John, who opened it, peeked inside, and sighed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much in here, Abe,‚Äù he said, his hands reaching in and pulling out a small pile of papers. ‚ÄúWhat are we supposed to do with five pages of rumors and hearsay? This is not even close to being a full report.‚Äù¬†

¬†

John looked up at Abrams, his face demonstrating frustration at what he felt was a waste of time. ‚ÄúAbe, you have to be joking. You told us to meet at the last minute for this? A stack of near-useless information about something we can‚Äôt act on! Where‚Äôs the rest of it?‚Äù Barrett raised a hand, cutting off John‚Äôs ranting. He turned to Abrams again. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not wrong, Abe. What are you holding out on us? Why couldn‚Äôt this information wait and get passed down through the regular channels between our employers? What got you so spooked that you had us meet you out here in the middle of a tsunami for what sounds like nothing we can move on?‚Äù¬†

¬†

Abrams shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his gaze darting to the rain-smeared windshield. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one more thing,‚Äù he said, reaching into his coat pocket. The motion was deliberate, almost hesitant, as if he were debating whether to hand over what he had. From the folds of his coat, he produced a small, creased photograph encased in a thin, fogged plastic sleeve. He extended it to Barrett, who took it carefully, his brow furrowed as he studied the image.¬†

¬†

The photo was grainy and damaged; it looked as though it had been taken by a low-quality camera and then run over several times. It depicted a group of men standing in what appeared to be a small room, their faces half hidden in shadows from poor lighting. The uniforms were unmistakably German SS, pristine and rigid. But what grabbed Barrett‚Äôs attention was the figure standing in the center. He was tall, his face half hidden. What was visible of his face revealed an emotionless madman: he sported a neatly trimmed beard and piercing, almost predatory eyes. The man‚Äôs arm stretched outward as if gesturing to something or someone, just beyond the edge of the frame. Behind him, a black banner with a strange symbol‚Äînot the usual Nazi insignia‚Äîhung like a sinister backdrop. The insignia was a complex series of golden straight lines that crossed in the middle, each etched with runic characters that seemed to shift and twist when viewed for too long. A deep crimson circle occupied the center of the symbol. A singular concentric ring adorned with cryptic markings encircled the odd design. The bottom of the flag beneath the image carried the motto ‚ÄúWas verborgen ist, wird offenbar werden.‚Äù Barrett recognized the motto ‚ÄúWhat is Hidden will be Revealed.‚Äù He took a moment trying to remember where he had come across that same saying before. He racked his brain, but all he could recall was seeing it in an old book he had read while he was a child in Dresden. Tearing his eyes from the insignia and wording, his eyes returned to the man in the center of the picture, tapping it with the tip of his finger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd recognize that face anywhere, that‚Äôs Karl Schneider, the butcher of Warsaw.‚Äù¬†

¬†

An uncomfortable shiver crawled up Barrett‚Äôs spine just from saying the man‚Äôs name. As he scanned the rest of the picture, he noticed someone else in the image whom he had not noticed at first. They appeared to almost blend into the background, standing separate from the SS officers. They seemed to be wearing a Russian intelligence officer uniform. She was a tall woman with shoulder-length hair and what appeared to be a blank expression, almost doll-like. Something about her made Barrett feel uncomfortable looking at her. He handed the photograph to John, who peered at it intently. ‚ÄúThat symbol?‚Äù Barrett paused, thinking deeply. The symbol seemed so out of place for an SS officer meeting; it left him thoroughly confused and worried. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the girl? John said she is not German and that Russian uniform proves she is absolutely not SS.‚Äù Looking up, John‚Äôs head turned towards Abrams, hoping he would have the answer.

¬†

Abrams nodded grimly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs got MI5 spooked. It has been showing up in places it shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîdocuments, facilities, and uniforms. Almost every time we get a picture just like that one, we see that same woman somewhere in it, it‚Äôs too much of a damn coincidence to think.‚Äù The air in the car grew heavier, the rhythmic patter of the rain now feeling like a drumbeat of dread. Barrett didn‚Äôt need to say what both he and John were thinking. Something dangerous was happening, and they had no idea what any of this meant. Abrams shifted in his seat and leaned forward slightly, his tone hardening. ‚ÄúThis is what you‚Äôre dealing with. Schneider isn‚Äôt just a mindless butcher; he‚Äôs smart, cunning, and he‚Äôs got something big in the works.‚Äù Abrams paused as thunder roared from a nearby lightning strike, drowning out their conversation. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs behind the meaning of that symbol and the presence of our mystery Russian... it‚Äôs not good.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett saw Abram‚Äôs sigh deeply and looked down, shaking his head as if debating whether to say anything else. His head came back up as he yelled into the rain again, ‚ÄúLook, I know it‚Äôs not a lot, but it‚Äôs all I have for you. My higher-ups don‚Äôt even know I gave you this. They‚Äôve been sitting on this for nearly three weeks and have no plans of sharing it with your government. I don‚Äôt like either of you cunts, but I hate Nazis more, so you can be grateful for what I get you.‚Äù Barrett and John looked at each other, and both men burst out laughing. Barrett felt slightly lightheaded from laughing so hard, the tension dissipating slightly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard you swear before, Abrams,‚Äù he said between laughs, ‚Äúmy virgin ears.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Abrams cracked a small smile. ‚ÄúYou Yanks can get fucked for all I care, but I don‚Äôt want your bloody incompetence bringing me and my country down with you.‚Äù With a nod, he started rolling up his window and grabbed the gear shifter, putting the car in drive. ‚ÄúNo one knows you have that. Don‚Äôt let me hang for this.‚Äù With a roar from his engine and a spray of loose gravel shooting out from his tires, Barrett watched as Abrams‚Äô car sped off out of the parking lot and down the empty road, quickly disappearing from sight as he watched the vehicle in the rearview mirror.¬†

¬†

Barrett put his hand on the window crank and rolled it up the rest of the way and sat there wiping away the water, trying to dry the door interior a little. The only sound in the vehicle was the rustling of pages as John went through the documents. Occasionally, Barrett could hear John muttering something under his breath as he read. He knew better than to interrupt John; the man was working and was processing in detail the information provided to them. Barrett replayed the interaction through his mind, waiting for John to get done reading. So much of what Abrams had told them didn‚Äôt make sense. Why was MI5 not willing to share this information through the proper channels, and why were they reportedly just sitting on this information? Granted, this wasn‚Äôt earth-shattering information. The Russian Federation and the Germans were allies, and having secret meetings wasn‚Äôt all that strange.¬†

¬†John let out a sigh and shoved the picture and the papers back into the folder, tossing it into the glove compartment in front of him. He folded his arms again and stared out into the storm, his eyes shifting slightly back and forth as he processed information internally, his mouth moving in a silent conversation that only he was involved in. ‚ÄúThis is weird,‚Äù John finally said. ‚ÄúIf Abrams was right, and this information is legitimate, and this is cause for concern... I don‚Äôt know... this is nothing.‚Äù He took a calming breath before going on. ‚ÄúWe have what? One name, no dates even, just a mention of Berlin, and not even who this mystery Russian bitch is and why it‚Äôs so concerning; is she a scientist, a doctor, a soldier, or God forbid, a Toxkin? She is just appearing randomly in all these pictures, and no one even knows her name!‚Äù¬†

¬†

The vehicle fell silent again as both men sat there thinking, trying to make sense of a very odd meeting that seemed almost a waste of their time. ‚ÄúYou want to take it back to Ironwood and run it past the team to see what they think?‚Äù Barrett suggested, not wanting to just sit idly in the car anymore, in wet clothes, he had a gnawing hunger in his gut, which was making it hard to think. John nodded. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some food first. I‚Äôm hungry as hell, and I want a little more time to think before we take it to the boss. He‚Äôs going to want an actionable plan for this, but it‚Äôs so bare bones that I have nothing on how we can make this beneficial for us.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett shifted the car into drive and took off out of the parking lot and down the road, heading down the hill back towards the city. Inside the car, it was silent for most of the 45-minute drive back. The windshield wipers worked frantically to clear the water. The rain was not letting up at all, the Studebakers headlights struggled to cut through the sheets of rain. Barrett almost missed the on ramp for the US 101, the main highway that would take them back to San Francisco. Barrett noticed that there were only a handful of vehicles on the road. Between the bad weather and the recent fuel shortages in the area, he wasn‚Äôt surprised that people would choose to stay in if they didn‚Äôt have to be anywhere important. As the familiar sight of the Golden Gate Bridge appeared in front of them, Barrett was struck with a feeling of vulnerability; the war still felt like a European problem, the raging conflict nothing but an interesting headline in the paper, but here they were in a major American city, and it almost felt like they were on the front lines. This was his home, somewhere he was supposed to feel safe, but he had never felt more vulnerable than now.

They crossed the bridge and drove through the narrow streets of the city, only passing a handful of cars as they went. After a few minutes, they pulled into the parking lot of a small diner. There were only two other vehicles in the lot, both parked near the door. Barrett got out and stretched before heading inside. The diner was brightly lit, with a warm, glowing neon sign that read ‚ÄúBayside Diner.‚Äù Once inside, Barrett and John seated themselves in the corner booth farthest from the door. Both men wanted to have the wall at their backs with a clear view of their surroundings, especially while eating. The choice of seating was natural and instinctual after years of training and experience in dangerous situations where anyone around them could be a threat.¬†

¬†

As he sat, Barrett scanned the near-empty restaurant. It was a typical American-style setup: a long counter ran along one side, flanked by swivel stools bolted to the floor. Opposite the counter were rows of booths with vinyl-upholstered seats in bright, cheerful cherry red. The air carried the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the savory scent of bacon frying somewhere in the kitchen.¬†

¬†

A man and a woman sat at the counter, both appearing to be in their early 40s, neatly dressed, and respectable looking. The woman glanced over at the booth. Barrett met her gaze, smiled, and nodded politely. Her eyes widened, and she immediately ducked her head, whispering something to her male companion. Barrett‚Äôs brow furrowed at the odd behavior. Granted, people were often less trusting of strangers, but something about her reaction didn‚Äôt sit right. Looking down, Barrett noticed that his coat had not been covering his firearm completely from view. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù People in this city were spooked easily by men carrying guns; on a different day, that would have been a good enough explanation, but tonight felt wrong. He strained to hear her words; Barrett was too far away to hear anything, and the gentle music from the jukebox in the corner muddled any conversation he might have overheard.¬†

¬†

Keeping the couple in the corner of his eye, Barrett picked up the menu in front of him and scanned the options, looking for something to take the edge off his miserable day. His eyes flicked briefly to John, who was staring intently at the breakfast items on the menu, seemingly unaware of the odd exchange with the female patron.¬†

¬†

A few moments later, he looked up as he heard tired footsteps approaching their table. A young, pretty woman wearing a powder blue uniform with a white apron tied around her waist appeared. She looked exhausted, her blonde hair tied in a bun atop her head, with a few loose strands poking out at odd angles. She smiled genuinely and spoke in a soft Southern drawl.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúHey there, fellas. What can I get you? Pancakes, bacon? Maybe an umbrella.‚Äù Barrett smiled broadly and laughed. ‚ÄúCoffee unless the bacon comes with your phone number, then I‚Äôll have that too.‚Äù John let out a short laugh, and Barrett shot him a look. The server groaned, then chuckled softly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell if that was good or if I‚Äôm just tired, but not the worst one-liner I‚Äôve heard,‚Äù Pulling out a small notebook and pen from her apron pocket. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Lily. What can I get you, boys?‚Äù John ordered first. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a stack of waffles with syrup, eggs, bacon, and a pot of that black coffee you‚Äôve got back there.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Lily quickly jotted down his order. ‚ÄúAnd what about you, sunshine?‚Äù She asked, one of her bright blue eyes winking at Barrett while holding his gaze. Swallowing hard, he felt his cheeks warm slightly and his heartbeat uncomfortably in his chest. Fumbling over his words, Barrett‚Äôs usual confidence had disappeared.

¬†

‚ÄúI... uh... I‚Äôll take some pancakes and sausage, eggs, and some OJ if that‚Äôs no trouble for you.‚Äù Mumbling into the menu, he tried to look at her, but still felt his cheeks warming after her wink.

Lily giggled, her laughter light and inviting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs big trouble, but for you, I‚Äôll make an exception and bring back my number too; it‚Äôs your lucky day, Prince Charming.‚Äù She reached for the menus to take back from the two rain soaked men; Lily‚Äôs fingers gently brushed over Barrett‚Äôs, while taking the menu from him; hers were warm and soft, a welcome change from the cold Pacific rain that had soaked him all day. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kind of cute when you get all embarrassed, you know that?‚Äù

Barrett let out a small laughing groan. ‚ÄúThis is why I don‚Äôt talk to pretty girls; I get all tongue-tied and flustered.‚Äù

‚ÄúLily, that‚Äôs a nice name,‚Äù John smiled at her. ‚ÄúI like the way you talk, too. Where are you from, darlin?‚Äù¬†

¬†Lily blushed a little. ‚ÄúWhy, that‚Äôs mighty forward of you, mister. ‚ÄúHer tone light and playful still, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm originally from Savannah, Georgia; what about you two fine gentlemen?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from a little further south, Tasmania, a little island along the southeast coast of Australia,‚Äù he embellished his accent, making it thick, nearly comical in his presentation.¬†

‚ÄúAustralia! Well, I‚Äôll be; you‚Äôre the first one of them I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù Turning, she looked at Barrett. ‚ÄúWhat about you, Romeo? You as exotic as your friend here?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo, can‚Äôt say that I am, unfortunately, I grew up just north of here. Not that exotic at all, just home-grown country boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOoof, I don‚Äôt know about you then,‚Äù Lily teased, her eyes ran up and down his rain-soaked physique, taking him all in. ‚ÄúNah, never mind, I think you‚Äôre alright still.‚Äù She finished jotting down their order, pausing, she flipped the page of her notebook and scribbled something down, ripping off the page, she folded it and placed it on the table next to Barrett‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI changed my mind on making you wait till your food is done for this.‚Äù With that said, she turned around and disappeared into the kitchen. Barrett and John watched her as she walked away, her perfume lingering around them; the faint sweet scent of cherries made her seem even more alluring.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúLook at you, making that poor girl fall in love,‚Äù John laughed, punching Barrett on the shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to teach me that whole bumbling idiot schtick. The girls love it.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett groaned and buried his face in his hands. ‚ÄúOh, get bent, you stupid hick. I‚Äôm tired, and my brain just seized up on me.‚Äù He pressed the palms of his hands against his eyes, massaging them deeply in an attempt to make the exhaustion and embarrassment go away. Barrett‚Äôs heart was pumping a little too hard and a little too fast to ignore the fact that he had been completely taken by her. Reaching down, he picked up the paper note she left; opening up the fold, he saw in dark blue ink her number and address written down with a tiny heart punctuating the end. His stomach flipped a little; a small smile pulled at the corner of his mouth.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúI bet she‚Äôd cuddle you real close if you told her you were lonely,‚Äù John teased. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs pretty, and she thinks you‚Äôre cute. You‚Äôre getting old, and you‚Äôre not aging very well, so this might be your last chance at love.‚Äù Barrett, head still in hand, mumbled something unintelligible. John leaned back into the back cushion of the booth and smirked. ‚ÄúSeriously, Barrett, she seems nice, not like that last girl you dated. I want you to take her out tomorrow somewhere nice and get to know her.‚Äù Barrett looked up from his hands and sat up straight, exhaustion and embarrassment showing on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, Tessa wasn‚Äôt that bad,‚Äù he replied; ‚ÄúShe had her issues to work out, but I know she was a good person. We just didn‚Äôt fit.‚Äù John raised an eyebrow and stretched out his arms, draping them over the top of the bench he was leaning against. He gave Barrett a hard look, his eyes drilling into Barrett‚Äôs, reminiscent of a dad about to scold his child for saying something incredibly stupid. ‚ÄúNot that bad?‚Äù John said in disbelief. ‚ÄúDude, she slashed the tires on your car for not taking her on a work trip to Austin. She also told your mom and dad she was pregnant and kept that lie up for months until she got tired of it and straight up told you she made the whole thing up because she was afraid you were going to dump her.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Barrett opened his mouth to shoot back a sarcastic response, but stopped. In the corner of Barrett‚Äôs vision, he noticed the man sitting at the bar had gotten up suddenly. Barrett turned his head slightly to get a better look. The man was standing there, his hands inside the pockets of his trench coat, staring at them. He stood there for just a moment before making eye contact. The man quickly looked away and sped toward the front door, disappearing into the rain. Barrett felt his stomach drop as he watched the black silhouette of the man walk to the back of a vehicle and pop open the trunk. Barrett saw that John was staring out the window too, the humor gone from his face and his smile replaced with a scowl. John had the same gut feeling that something was deeply wrong, his body physically tensing to respond to a potential threat. Barrett slowly placed his hand on the grip of his Colt M1911A1. The cold wood and steel grip brought some comfort, and his index finger found the button clasp on the holster. He quietly popped it open in case he needed to quickly draw his sidearm.¬†

¬†

On the other side of the table, he saw John slide from the middle of the booth bench to the edge, allowing him to rapidly get out of the booth if the need arose. John‚Äôs right arm was down at his side. John‚Äôs massive hand enveloped the grip of his Browning Hi-Power, his preferred choice for its weight and reliability.¬†

¬†

Barrett looked over at the woman still sitting at the counter. Her face was paler than before, and she was looking down intensely at her coffee cup. He could see that her hands were shaking slightly; in her hands appeared to be a small silver charm on a string around her neck, her fingers fidgeting with it, her lips racing as she whispered frantically to it. She hadn‚Äôt even looked up once, from the man standing to him, rushing out the door.¬†

¬†‚ÄúJohn‚Ä¶‚Äù Barrett whispered, his eyes not leaving the woman at the counter.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see the male anymore,‚Äù John replied in a tense tone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs ducked down, messing with something in that trunk.‚Äù¬†

Barrett‚Äôs jaw clenched, his teeth grinding, and the muscles in his neck tightened in anticipation. ‚ÄúFemale at the counter,‚Äù Barrett murmured. ‚ÄúNo weapons I can see. She‚Äôs stressed, though. Shaking, she‚Äôs talking to herself.‚Äù The seconds seemed to stretch on for hours. Every heartbeat felt like a thud from a lead weight in his chest, his eyes and ears straining for any sign of movement. The world became quiet. Barrett could only hear his tense breathing; the music from the jukebox had disappeared, leaving a near-deafening silence. Barrett heard John move suddenly.¬†

¬†‚ÄúOh, shit!‚Äù John shouted.¬†

¬†A sound of thunder boomed, the front window shattered into a thousand pieces, tinkling down and crashing across the diner floor. Barrett snapped his head toward the sound and saw the man from the diner leaning out from behind the raised trunk of the vehicle. He was holding a long, dark object pointed directly at Barrett‚Äôs head. A flash of white exploded from the muzzle, searing into Barrett‚Äôs vision. The world seemed to stutter, every movement slowed by the deafening crack of the shot.",1,1753464023.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

I was super intimidated by the cost of espresso at first, but after tuning what I have here, I am happy I jumped down this rabbithole! I think this represents pretty much the minimal setup needed to pull some great shots. Altogether this was roughly $370 CAD total.

With the grinder on 7.1 clicks, my 13.7g filled basket is yielding 30gish out in about 28sec. With the milk froth tube removed, I'm getting some nice microfoam too, although I suck at art still. Very happy with the taste and texture, 10x better than normal coffee shops around me. Still honing it in but its allot of fun and very rewarding, I use sticky notes to keep track of what I'm doing.

Gear Breakdown:
Delonghi stilosa 3630 - $170
     Stainless steel boiler, manual controls, great size
Timemore Chestnut C3esp - $130
     Enough adjustment to dial in espresso, easy to use
Naked Portafilter, tamper, scale, etc - ~$70

Still using cheap beans, will look into that stuff once I get through what I have! Hopefully this is motivation for other background fence sitters, such as I was.

I'm sure most of you have had issues with this in the past and I'm just wondering the angle or ways you've been successful at finally making your mormon parents get over this aspect of life with drinking coffee and alcohol in front of them.

To give context - my husband has NEVER been mormon. So he does not understand my parents perspectives at all. But I've always told him to just not order drinks when we go out to eat with them because I've tried to ""respect"" their views. 

I still post pictures of us drinking coffee and beer on MY instagram and my mom will comment on it and just question why I have to post about it. I think she's trying to save face because people within her mormon circle and my extended family follow me, but I think she genuinely is bugged by it and thinks it's offensive to her beliefs. I've always brushed it off and said ""it's not worth my time or an argument with my mom"" since we don't live in the same state and I don't really have to be around her more than a few times a year. But I think I'm at my wit's end with her constant argument towards me saying ""I'm disrespecting her"" and ""I'm just seeking validation through with these constant posts"". 

What are some unarguable statements on this situation? Logically, it doesn't make sense. And she has many friends that are not mormon and she would never say those things to anyone else but she says them to me. She is a flight attendant and literally has to serve people alcohol on planes. What should my pov be other than ""I am not offended on your choice to not drink coffee/beer and you should respect mine"" any advice is appreciated! We are meeting them next week and will probably be going out to dinner with them and I would LOVE my husband to be able to order a drink without it turning into a argument haha.

1m9506r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9506r,Protest Locations,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve had a thought that‚Äôs been sitting heavy‚Äîand I want to open it up for discussion.

We often center protests around state capitols, detention centers, politicians' homes, and hotels. And while those actions are powerful, I keep wondering:

Why aren‚Äôt we showing up at the churches?
Every Sunday, millions gather to worship in comfort under the banners of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù ‚Äúlife,‚Äù and ‚Äúmorality‚Äù‚Äîwhile Gaza starves. While children die. While the U.S. bankrolls genocide, builds modern concentration camps, and strips away human rights.

And the churches say nothing.
Worse, many actively support these systems.

Let‚Äôs be honest: the church has always played a central role in protecting:

White supremacy
Patriarchy
War
Colonial violence
Genocide
Fascist nationalism
They are not neutral.
They are not innocent.
They are not merely ‚Äúquiet.‚Äù
They are complicit pillars of violent power.

These same churches are quick to protest outside abortion clinics, LGBTQ+ events, and school boards‚Äîyet they remain completely silent while actual atrocities unfold.

And part of the reason they stay comfortable?
Because they‚Äôre allowed to.

They can log off social media.
They can ignore state buildings and protest sites.
They get to return each week to polished pews, coffee tables, and moral theater‚Äîuntouched, unbothered, and protected from the consequences of their silence.

So what happens when we take the truth to their doorstep?
What happens when Sunday service is no longer a refuge from accountability?

What happens when we stop treating their silence as ignorance and start treating it as the violence it is?

I also came across some strategies for engaging people who are trapped in cult-like belief systems. I‚Äôll post screenshots below‚Äîbut I‚Äôm curious:

What would it look like to confront complicity where it hides most comfortably?
What do we gain by refusing to let them pray while others die?

Let‚Äôs talk.
Let‚Äôs organize smarter.
Let‚Äôs stop asking for change‚Äîand start forcing it into view.

That was my first mistake.

My plan was simple: assemble a tiny, pastel oasis on my kitchen table and pretend I didn‚Äôt live across the street from a woman who once filed a noise complaint about ‚Äúsuspicious chili energy.‚Äù But just as I opened the box‚Äî1,200 pink pieces in, three band-aids deep‚Äî*Carol reappeared*.

She emerged like a groundhog with unresolved trauma, dragging a folding table to the park stump (yes, the stump‚Äîthe one now shadowed by the remains of the Dragon Truce). On the table? A sign that read:

And beneath that:

**‚ÄúNow offering hand-screened soup awareness tank tops ‚Äì $18.‚Äù**

As I tried to breathe through my teeth and assemble the mini blossom pergola, my eyes caught movement on the patio.

The caterpillar was back.

This time, it was sitting on the unopened instruction manual, sipping‚Äî*I swear*‚Äîfrom the condensation ring of my iced coffee. It had a **tiny clipboard**. I don‚Äôt know where it came from. It looked like it was doing *quality control*.

Meanwhile, the hot tub saga escalated.

A new tub was discovered this week, perched halfway up the town water tower. This one had a disco ball and a sign reading ‚Äú*Saturday is for the Bubbles.*‚Äù Carol accused me personally at the HOA meeting. I pointed out that I have vertigo and an intense fear of ladders. She hissed.

Back to the tree house. Building it took me three days and a brief moment of dissociation where I believed I was the mini-lady reclining on the tiny deck with a brick mimosa. I installed it on my windowsill, facing Carol‚Äôs property. Pure coincidence.

The next morning, I found a **matching treehouse** made of egg cartons, yarn, and boiled popsicle sticks assembled across the street. Carol had built her own. She was watering it. She had named it.

‚Äú**The Real Retreat.**‚Äù

It collapsed around 4 p.m. after a raccoon sneezed near it.

What I did:
	‚Ä¢	Followed a progressive overload program with a push-pull-legs split, which was overseen by my powerlifting best friend 
	‚Ä¢	Ran more consistently and built mileage week by week. Followed up each lifting session of 1 hr with at least 30 min of running. 
	‚Ä¢	Added cross-training with cycling for endurance.
	‚Ä¢	Practiced yoga & pranayama to strengthen my lungs.
	‚Ä¢	Improved my diet and added coffee (surprisingly helpful for lungs). Ate a shit load of healthy-ish food but never went on a restrictive diet. 
	‚Ä¢	Asthma management: naturopathy sessions at Patanjali Yogpeeth (Haridwar, back in 2016 and it was there I learnt how to do yoga and pranayam) started running consistently ~1 year 6 months ago to strengthen lungs+ consistent breathing exercises. Used my inhaler only for SOS situations (duolin)

We decided for this latest trip (Koningsdam to Alaska) we'd give it a try. Given all the people taking cruises to Alaska from Vancouver, I thought it would be worthwhile to share.

Pros:

* No TSA, no real security checkpoint at all, other than security officers around the station keeping an eye on things.
* You can arrive much later than you'd normally arrive at the airport. Basically they can't accept your checked luggage until 75 minutes before departure, and they want you to get your luggage checked by 45 minutes priort to departure.
* You can get up and walk around on the train. There's a snack bar car with a variety of hot and cold food, and tables to eat the food (though there seemed to be people camped out at the tables the whole time)
* Seats are wider and have more legroom than standard airline coach seats - I would compare them to first class airline seats, even if you're in regular train seats and not ""business class"".
* A bit cheaper, especially considering you get two checked bags included for free with Amtrak. (For our trip, it was $84 for train, $95 for plane plus $25 for checked bag).
* Scenery along this route is fantastic. The train tracks run right along the coast of Puget Sound and the views of the Sound and the islands are beautiful.
* Customs at the train terminal was quick and easy. There just aren't that many people arriving at once and they got through us quickly.

Cons:

* The on-time performance of Amtrak is very poor. Our train arrived about 40 minutes late. My son did some analysis of two years worth of actual arrival times and said that only about 30% of trips arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, and 5% are 90 minutes late or more. On the other hand, he took the train back from Vancouver last week and it arrived 5 minutes early.
* By our figuring, allowing for extra time getting to the airport and getting through security, the total time door-to-door of the train is about 2 hours longer than taking a plane, even if it's on time.
* The King Street Station in Seattle is very pretty, but has no real services. No food, not even a coffee kiosk. There are some restaurants nearby within a block or two, and since you don't have to go through security it's easy to check your bags and then walk to, say, Zeitgeist Coffee about 2 blocks away. Though I wouldn't count Zeitgeist as among Seattle's top coffee shops, it does the trick and has good pastries.

All things considered, we'd probably do the train again. If you're not in a huge rush, the overall experience was less hassle and overall more comfortable. And honestly, ""business class"" didn't look like you got much, other than you're the first to board the train and the first to get off.",3,1753463477.0,Cruise,7,1.0,False

*July 26, 2025 | 12:11 AM ET | Kauffman Stadium*

**The Setup:**  
The Cleveland Guardians (51-51) roll into Kansas City as underdogs, but don‚Äôt let that fool you‚Äîthey‚Äôve got the 26th-ranked offense in MLB, which is just one spot above the *Kansas City Royals* (50-53), who are the second-worst scoring team in baseball. This is a game where ‚Äúscoring runs‚Äù might as well be a foreign language for both squads.

**The Pitching Matchup:**

* **Gavin Williams (CLE)**: The Guardians‚Äô ace aims to avoid looking like a human sprinkler. His 4.5 K prop is at -130 (implied 57% chance to strikeout 5+ batters). Let‚Äôs hope he‚Äôs had coffee today.
* **Michael Wacha (KC)**: The Royals‚Äô starter needs to avoid becoming a free RBI buffet. His 2.5 ER Over/Under is at +125 (41% implied chance to give up 3+ runs). Good luck, Mike.

**The Moneyline & Spread:**

* **Royals -112** (52.8% implied probability).
* **Guardians +162** (38.5% implied).
* **Spread: Guardians -1.5 (-110)**. The Guardians need to outscore the Royals by *two* runs? That‚Äôs like

1m94uts,https://www.reddit.com/r/FragranceStories/comments/1m94uts/finding_a_signature_scent/,Finding A Signature Scent,"I very recently started getting into fragrances and seeing them as another way to express myself versus just something you wear for a fancy night out.

I work in advertising (creative industry) and I also paint in my spare time, so naturally, my friends and family think of me as an artist and creative. 

Knowing this I was leaning towards a more unique fragrance from a niche house, but after trying some well known one's I'm not sure what would suit me / what I would like. 

Basically, I'm looking for a fragrance that is more mass appealing, but still unique. A chill laid-back, but masculine artist whose a bit mysterious, but really kind once you get to know them (or so I've been told haha). Definitely not a ""loud"" artist with eclectic fashion that you immediately see and think ""yup, that's definitely one of those creative types.""

**For context here are some fragrances that I've tried and my opinion on them:**  
  
**Imperium - Electimuss: 8/10**  
A nice smokey creamy vanilla with some wood and floral notes. Leans unisex, but a good date night fragrance. Pleasant, but I wouldn't say it's an interesting fragrance that you'd remember if you smelt it.

**Louis Vuitton - Imagination: 10/10**  
A universally pleasant fragrance that I can wear for any occasion. I can wear it to the office, on a date, out with friends. It is like a peaceful beach day and then it turns into like a light sweet grass. I understand why it is so loved.

**Nasomatto - Pardon: 6.7/10**  
Like licorice and leathe? A bit like rubbing vicks? There's suppose to be chocolate notes, but I don't get those at all. Over time it gets a bit lighter and is more tame and pleasant, but definitely not a crowd pleaser. Could see this scent offending some people. Feels kind of like the spray they use at barbershops after they cut your hair. 

**Vilhelm - Morning Chess: 8.5/10**  
Like a citrus leather with some wood notes. Feels green and vibrant. Can be worn at the office, on a date, etc, very versatile. This one seems to be pretty mass appealing with a bit of a unique flare to it.

**L'Air Du Desert Marocain: 6/10**  
Early on very woody and spicy fresh. Somewhere with lots of sand, but the leathery notes make it feel a bit medicinal. Starts off interesting, but then not so great. Wouldn't wear, but could see the appeal for some. 

**Maison Margiela - Jazz Club: 9/10**  
Like a spicy rum and tobacco with a bit of vanilla that softens it. More prominent wood notes come in after. It feels a bit mysterious, masculine, and sexy. Definitely a date night fragrance. Wouldn't say it's suitable for the office. 

**Maison Margiela - Coffee Break: 7.5/10**  
Very sweet and chocolatey. You also get some light coffee notes. Pleasant, like it definitely won't offend anyone, but I find it a bit too sweet for my liking. If the sweetness was a bit toned down and there was some light wood notes and a more prominent coffee note, I'd be a lot more into it and it might fit my personality and overall vibe more. 

**Nasomatto - Baraonda: 3/10**  
Honey whiskey. Way too authentic, feels like I'm sniffing Jack Daniel's from a shot glass. I kinda hate this scent. 

**Naked Dance - Oddity 4.5/10**  
Was excited to try this as it popped up a lot as a fragrance that might appeal to artists. I get a powdery clay like a clay studio and it kind of just smells like a retirement home? Wanted to like this, but it's a no for me. It at least isn't super offensive, but it does not appeal to me at all. 

**Orto Parisi - Viride 5.5/10**  
I was excited to try this as I was curious to see if a really green scent might appeal to me, but this was too intense. Very authentic smell of forestry and pine trees. Soil and strong lemon grass. A bit medicinal and more pleasant on the dry down, but not for me.

**Kilian - Angels' Share 7/10**  
Very very sweet like apple pie. Personally, I think this would be a great scent for the holidays, but I just can't see myself wearing this outside of that period.",1,1753463296.0,FragranceStories,2,1.0,False

It gives you the perfect overview of all the major attractions and helps you plan where to spend more time later.

I recently took my cousins on the Pittsburgh Tour Company's sightseeing tour (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/pittsburgh), and it was honestly the best decision. The 2-hour tour covers all the major spots you'd want to see - from PNC Park to the Andy Warhol Museum - without wearing you out from walking.

After the tour, you'll want to head to Point State Park where the three rivers meet. It's stunning, especially during sunset. The fountain there is iconic, and you can get amazing photos of the city skyline.

Next, take a ride on one of Pittsburgh's historic inclines. The Duquesne or Monongahela Inclines offer spectacular views of the city. I prefer the Duquesne because the observation deck at the top gives you a perfect panoramic view of downtown.

For lunch, hit up the Strip District. It's a food lover's paradise with local specialties like Primanti Brothers sandwiches (yes, the ones with fries inside). The street is lined with ethnic food stores, Pittsburgh merchandise, and amazing coffee shops.

In the afternoon, depending on your interests, you can either:
- Visit the Andy Warhol Museum (the largest single-artist museum in North America)
- Catch a Pirates game at PNC Park (one of the most beautiful ballparks in America)
- Explore the Carnegie Science Center
- Shop at the South Side Works

For dinner, head to Mount Washington. The restaurants there offer incredible city views. My personal recommendation is Altius - make sure to request a window seat.

Pro tip: Start your day with that bus tour I mentioned. It really helps you get oriented and understand Pittsburgh's unique layout. The guides are actually locals who know their stuff (not just people reading from scripts), and you can ask them for personalized recommendations based on your interests.

The tour I linked above has been consistently rated 4.7/5 stars by over 500 people, which says a lot. They offer both open-air seating up top and air-conditioned lower level options, which is perfect regardless of weather. Plus, you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change.

Pittsburgh may seem complex with its bridges and hills, but with this itinerary, you'll hit all the major highlights in one day. Just remember to book the tour in advance - it often sells out, especially during summer months and game days.",1,1753463280.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m94u4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1m94u4k/mast_cells_histamines_my_headache_journey/,"Mast cells & histamines, my headache journey","\*TLDR at end.

What got rid of my constant, daily headaches? Antihistamines.

Let's start a few years back when I basically found myself unable to drink beer in the summertime. I've had seasonal allergies my whole life so am used to that. But i noticed when sipping on a nice cold beer on a summer day, I would start sneezing. My face would get red and hot. By the end of the beer, I was stuffed right up. Shortly after stopping drinking, everything would clear up. Some googling led me to learn about histamine intolerance and the ""histamine bucket""; so there's histamines in lots of things including various foods and alcohol, and of course allergies. Basically everyone has a threshold for how much histamine they can tolerate, and that once that bucket is full, it starts overflowing aka causing symptoms. Because my histamine bucket was already half full due to seasonal allergies, the beer (which is also high in histamines) would send me over the edge. Okay, so my allergies are getting worse, gotcha.

Time goes by, and I'm realizing all of a sudden that I've been using my emergency inhaler like, several times a day. I've had asthma since I was 7, but any use of the emergency inhaler over 2x/week would warrant a doctor's visit, as it's a sign my preventative inhaler isn't doing its job. This takes me down a looooong path of endoscopies, a 24h ECG holter monitor strapped to my chest, an exercise tolerance test at the hospital, as well as a pulmonary lung function test. I'm shocked at the pulmonary lung function test as I'm literally short of breath during the test, and the tech still tells me that the test shows hardly any reduced lung function, aka basically, I don't even have asthma anymore. Wat. As this point, I'm getting random heart palpitations due to my inhaler overuse.

Now a couple years later in the spring time, suddenly I'm developing a red, angry rash all over my legs that I need to apply hydrocortisone cream to in order to get rid of. It just becomes the new normal for me, the spring time rash.

Fast forward a few years. I had to switch careers due to joint injuries that never fully resolved (wrist, ankle sprains) to a more sedentary position. I'm also finding that, not only can I not perform my previously active career, but I'm having trouble even exercising. After climbing a couple sets of stairs I find myself panting, I feel my heart pounding quickly in my chest, my legs hurt so bad I feel like they're going to give out on me. Walking my dog results in a pounding headache, and I have to collapse on my couch when I get back home. The first few times, it made me panic, which made things worse, and I truly did almost faint a few times - even in the middle of a grocery store. I had my blood sugar levels tested, they were perfect. I started reading up about dysautonomia and POTS, which causes similar symptoms in people.

Fast forward a few more months and now I'm battling chronic headaches and migraines worse than ever before. I wake up with them. Nothing i do seems to help (switch pillows, change sleeping positions, stretch in the mornings, coffee/no coffee). I start googling the symptoms (feeling of fullness/pressure in head and ears, ringing in ears, pain that begins in the jaw and neck and moves up to around the back of my head and up to my temples) and learning about different types of headaches. I randomly read somewhere that taking a decongestant can help with headaches caused by sinus pressure. So I take one. The headache I had been battling for 7 days disappeared. My grogginess, lack of energy, moodiness, feeling of pressure in head and ears, it all vanished. So I start thinking - the pill I took had 3 medications in it: a decongestant, tylenol, and an antihistamine. Maybe it was the tylenol, and not the decongestant. Or maybe it was the antihistamine. Then I realized that this is the first spring/summer I have not religiously taken antihistamines daily for my seasonal allergies. I google correlation between antihistamines and headaches. Sure enough, antihistamines can definitely help chronic headaches. Wat! But I need to know *why*.

Meanwhile, my mom has had a test done for a condition called Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. She has chronic arthritis and has had several joints replaced already. I never really knew too much about MCAS, but I knew it was basically the body attacking itself in various ways. I wondered if there was a correlation there, too, and if MCAS was hereditary.

Turns out.... MCAS itself is not hereditary, however there is strong family linkages due to the types of genes that can cause MCAS. I started reading more about MCAS. I learned that Mast Cells are part of the immune system, and when you have MCAS those cells overreact to otherwise normal, neutral things (like beer on a sunny day). It affects various systems, including joints, digestion (i was ""diagnosed"" with IBS about 15 years ago), allergic reactions, acid reflux, as well as *chronic headaches.* ***MCAS also causes EXCESS HISTAMINE RELEASE***! MCAS is also closely tied to dysautonomia and POTS, with symptoms often overlapping! **I started taking an antihistamine every day** (Reactine). This was only 3 days ago, but literally all of my symptoms have vanished. The neck pain, jaw pain, ringing in ears, pressure, headaches, confusion, moodiness, tiredness. I feel like I'm back to my normal self!

Now I have some concrete evidence I can provide my doctor at my next appointment so we can finally do some thorough testing, but wow I feel like I just solved a murder mystery guys. I'm sharing this journey even though I'm not diagnosed yet because I finally feel like after so many years of weird, random symptoms that doctors couldn't explain or didn't even know how to test for (Canada, our healthcare system is horrible), I have finally found out the cause of all of it. Wrapped up in a neat little package, too. I hope if you have some of the same symptoms as me (my main ones: allergies; gastrointestinal issues; GERD or excess stomach acid; nausea; rashes; exercise intolerance; fast heart rate; chronic headaches; shortness of breath) please do some research of your own and see if this scenario might apply to you or if anyone in your family has EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) or MCAS.

1m94u3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1m94u3u/new_research_shows_the_impact_of_inflation/,"New research shows the impact of inflation, tariffs on consumer spending","Sharing original research recently collected by a quant + qual survey of 1,000 consumers nationwide (US) trying to better understand current consumer sentiment, and how consumer spending habits have or have not changed in the past year due to things like inflation/shrinkflation, tariff concerns, higher cost of living and more. 

  
In a Highlight survey taken the week of July 7, 2025, we polled our proprietary panel of nationwide consumers, achieving 1,000 completions with an even gender split (500 men and 500 women).¬†

Among other questions, we asked them:¬†**In terms of your personal finances, how do you feel today compared with this time last year?**

62% of respondents said money feels somewhat or much tighter than a year ago, while only 10% said money feels somewhat or much easier than a year ago. Over a quarter of respondents (28%) say that money feels about the same as compared with this time last year.

In an open-ended question, respondents were given the opportunity to describe how their consumption habits and saving strategies have changed in their own words. Highlight asked:¬†**Thinking about your everyday routines, purchases, or habits‚Äìis there anything you're doing now that you weren't doing a year ago?**¬†Here‚Äôs the full breakdown of respondents‚Äô qualitative responses:

**No/Not really:**¬†This or similar phrases like ""Nope it's the same,"" ""No changes,"" ""nothing,"" ""I don't think so,"" or ""everything is basically the same"" appears 93 times. This indicates a significant portion of the respondents haven't changed their habits much.

*‚ÄúI shop the same overall.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 47 years old, North Carolina

**Exercising more/Working out more:**¬†This theme appears 47 times. Many respondents mentioned exercising, working out, going to the gym, walking more, or increasing physical activity.

*‚ÄúDrinking more iced coffee, working out more, traveling less, reading audiobooks more.‚Äù -*¬†He/him, 36 years old, Illinois

**Eating healthier/Better food choices:**¬†This theme appears 39 times. Responses include eating healthier, eating more vegetables, focusing on protein, buying organic, or making healthier food choices.

*‚ÄúI'm eating better. I'm putting better stuff in my body. I'm working out more. Also I'm buying different things that I need for a healthier life.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 43 years old, Texas

**Budgeting/Saving money/More conscious of spending/Looking for sales:**¬†This broad category appears 65 times. Many people are trying to save money, be more budget-conscious, look for sales, use coupons, or buy less.

*‚Äú\[I‚Äôm\] budgeting better. Picked up a second job.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 39 years old, Tennessee

**Shopping online more:**¬†This response appears 25 times.

*‚ÄúI visit Sam's Club more often for bulk purchases and savings. I also shop online more frequently for pick up or shipped items from CVS.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 61 years old, Florida

**Cooking more/Eating at home more:**¬†This theme appears 14 times.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching my money more as things get more expensive. We‚Äôre also eating out less as restaurant prices have risen tremendously.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 58 years old, Pennsylvania

In this same Highlight survey of 1,000 Americans, we also asked respondents:¬†**What are you doing to better manage your spending?**

In a multiple choice question where respondents were invited to select all that apply, this is how panelists responded, from most popular to least popular responses:

* 67% of respondents are eating at home more often
* 57% are shopping sales more actively
* 55% are buying fewer non-essential products
* 54% are holding off on major purchases (e.g., tech, furniture)
* 43% are avoiding eating out
* 39% are switching to more affordable brands
* 33% are canceling subscriptions
* 32% are traveling less
* 30% are choosing private label/store brands
* 29% are buying in bulk
* 23% are using budgeting apps or tracking spending more closely
* 17% are cutting back on wellness and/or beauty spending
* 9% said none of the above

In a multiple choice question, Highlight asked respondents:¬†**Which of the following, if any, are you not willing to sacrifice‚Äìeven when budgets are tight? (Select up to three.)**¬†These were their answers, from most to least popular:

* 42% of respondents are not willing to give up high-quality food & beverages¬†
* 39% say they are not willing to give up their self-care and wellness routines
* 31% don‚Äôt want to give up their streaming services or other entertainment
* 30% say they won‚Äôt part with their preferred brands
* 29% won‚Äôt give up travel or experiences
* 23% said they won‚Äôt give up products that make them feel good or confident
* 15% said they won‚Äôt give up conveniences like delivery
* 7% said they won‚Äôt give up products that support sustainability of ethics

Highlight also gave respondents the opportunity to say what habits they are not willing to change or products they are not willing to give up in their own words.¬†

Overall, the¬†qualitative results¬†mirrored the quantitative: Consumers mentioned over and over again that they are unwilling to give up buying food, especially healthy, quality, or favorite foods.

While respondents across genders agreed high-quality food is their non-negotiable item, women most frequently mentioned their unwillingness to give up¬†**coffee**¬†specifically. Their open-ended responses mentioned iced coffee, Starbucks, Dunkin, ‚Äúgood coffee,‚Äù ‚Äúhomemade coffee,‚Äù and other specific brands.

*‚ÄúI MUST have my favorite coffee even though it's more expensive even now.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 61 years old, Iowa

Women respondents were also more likely to mention these topics in their open-ended answers:

* Specifically,¬†**healthy**¬†food was mentioned approximately 40 times, often paired with words like ‚Äúquality,‚Äù ‚Äúorganic,‚Äù and ‚Äúproduce.‚Äù
* **Personal care and self-care**¬†purchases were mentioned approximately 30 times, including terms like manicures, skincare, hair care, beauty, and nails.
* **Pets and pet products**¬†(dog food, cat food, vet care, pet supplies and more) were mentioned approximately 30 times.

*‚ÄúI still buy extra healthy food. The healthier the food, the more it will cost. I will not buy cheap food.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 66 years old, Arizona

*‚ÄúHair color and nail appointments.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 55 years old, Texas

*‚ÄúMy dog's food and heartworm medication. I will always make sure to buy her the good healthy food she is on and make sure she has her heartworm medication to take each month.‚Äù*¬†\- She/her, 25 years old, Florida

Male respondents also placed a premium on high-quality food and eating well. When it comes to themes that were repeated most frequently in their open-ended responses, nothing else came close to quality food, which was mentioned upwards of 60 times.

*‚ÄúI will still purchase organic produce and look for items that are healthier.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 43 years old, Arizona

But when we look at the honorable mentions, a few stand out:

* Men do not want to part with their¬†**streaming services**, television, and other entertainment (mentioned approximately 20 times)
* Men also mentioned¬†**travel**, vacations, and getaways as a non-negotiable (mentioned approximately 20 times)
* Men mentioned not wanting to give up purchases that support a¬†**healthy lifestyle**¬†(eating, gym, working out), but mentioned this less frequently than female respondents did (approximately 15 times versus 40 for women)

*‚ÄúI pay for a number of TV streaming services that I would feel deprived not to have.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 55 years old, Texas

*‚ÄúMy grocery bill and gym membership.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 47 years old, Oregon

*‚ÄúWe still go on trips and vacations.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 50 years old, New York

*‚ÄúMy kid‚Äôs favorite snack: She loves Takis. They‚Äôre a bit expensive but I give up things for her. She is all that matters.‚Äù*¬†\- He/him, 40 years old, North Carolina

Context 

People pretend to understand their children‚Äôs lives, but in truth, they‚Äôre often lying to themselves or their friends to save face. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many crying mothers come to me, desperate to find their kids, only to discover them in some drug den, squandering their ‚Äúcollege money.‚Äù That‚Äôs other people‚Äôs kids, right? Never your precious angel. But that‚Äôs the lie we tell ourselves. 
Despite our best efforts, our children are their own people, free to use their will as they choose. 

I did everything right in my parents‚Äô eyes, especially my father‚Äôs. I graduated high school, went straight to the police academy, and climbed the ranks in my midsized city. I became the youngest chief homicide detective, partly because the previous chief succumbed to a brutal heroin addiction. 

It wasn‚Äôt long before I met Jessica, the love of my life, the most beautiful brunette God ever created. That is, until our daughter, Becca, was born‚Äîshe became my entire world. Watching her grow, exploring the wonders around her, was what I looked forward to every day. Everything changed when Becca turned fourteen. 

It wasn‚Äôt teenage angst; it was Jessica‚Äôs stage-four ovarian cancer diagnosis. We were the perfect family until then‚Äîfamily dinners, summer vacations, never missing Becca‚Äôs extracurriculars. After the diagnosis, we grew stronger for a time, but watching the brightest light in your life fade to nothing would break even the strongest man. Seeing my frail wife take her last breath changed my fourteen-year-old daughter. 

Becca dropped all her activities and threw herself into her studies. As a father, I was proud of my honor student, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt miss her talking to me. Her high school years passed like this, but I stayed positive at home. I never wanted her to carry the weight of her broken father. 

That is until I was alone in the big, empty room where I once held my beautiful wife, the darkness sank in. It‚Äôs hard to describe the horror of that solitude. I‚Äôd sit in the middle of my bed, the walls racing in opposite directions, my skin shivering as a black hole opened in my chest, pulling in the misery the walls fled from. I didn‚Äôt cry or moan‚Äîjust trembled, wishing tears would release me from that cosmic pressure. 

You might think opening up to Becca or seeking family counseling would‚Äôve helped. I tried. For two years after Jessica‚Äôs death, we saw grief counselors, psychiatrists, you name it. It stopped the day Becca came home from school, tears in her eyes, and said, ‚ÄúPlease, no more shrinks, Dad. They can‚Äôt bring Mom back.‚Äù Her words confused me‚Äîno one was trying to resurrect Jessica. I said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just helping you process, sweetheart.‚Äù She looked at her fidgeting hands and whispered, ‚ÄúI know. I just want it to stop.‚Äù That day, I saw a pain in her deeper than at her mother‚Äôs funeral. I canceled all future sessions. 

When I dropped her off at college in the next state, I told her how proud I was. She hugged me tightly and said something that seared into me: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to pretend to be strong anymore.‚Äù It was four years before she contacted me again. 

I lasted six months before I started drinking. Even though Becca rarely spoke when she was home, she gave me purpose, a reason to hold it together. But her words haunted me like a broken record: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to pretend to be strong anymore.‚Äù I kept my job for another six months before taking early retirement at fifty. I wasn‚Äôt ready to stop working, but my drinking had taken over, affecting my ability to lead. I‚Äôd sneak drinks at work, chuckling to myself, ‚ÄúAt least it‚Äôs not heroin‚Äîthis job must be cursed.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to end up a disgrace like my predecessor, so retirement was the logical choice. 

I sold my home, downsized to a smaller place, hoping the walls wouldn‚Äôt race away. They did, and the void in my chest remained. With my remaining money, I bought a small office and became a private investigator, figuring I was the only boss who wouldn‚Äôt fire me for drinking. 

The next three years blurred with cases of infidelity, wayward kids, and odd jobs‚Äîuntil Becca called. At three a.m., I woke groggy, still buzzed, but her voice sobered me instantly. ‚ÄúDaddy, please come get me,‚Äù she said, followed by unintelligible garble. I always knew her location through Find My iPhone‚Äînot to stalk her, but because I never stopped paying her bills to support her through college. 

Her annual transcripts, sent without words, were her way of saying she was okay and thanking me. I didn‚Äôt need her calls, just confirmation she was safe. 

That night, she was ready. I drove like a man possessed to an oversized frat party. There, I found a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl slumped against a red sports car. It was Becca, just sleeping. I carried her to my car. 

The next morning, she woke to the smell of pancakes and me in the kitchen. Despite her hangover, her face lit up, and she rushed me with a bear hug, apologizing for not calling, saying she loved me over and over. Apparently, a sorority girl bragging about a Lake Tahoe trip with her father had triggered her, leading to drunken tears and her call to me. 

That sorority girl was the best thing to happen to me in years‚Äîshe gave me my daughter back. Becca was now the happy, strong woman her mother had been before the cancer. Over the next few days, she shared her life: her law major, her love for yoga, and why she‚Äôd stayed silent. 

She thought contacting me would drag me back into her pain, believing she was an anchor holding me down. She now knew that was never true. 

We started talking weekly. One day, she called about a guy she met at a coffee shop near her yoga class. They talked daily, but he hadn‚Äôt asked her out. She laughed, saying she‚Äôd give him one more chance tomorrow and promised to keep me posted. She never did. It‚Äôs been two years, and Becca still hasn‚Äôt been found. I‚Äôll never stop looking for the man who took her.",2,1753463137.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m94rle,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m94rle/explore_zojirushi_ecytc100xb_coffee_maker_review/,Explore Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB Coffee Maker Review Is It Worth The Hype?,"The Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB 10-Cup Coffee Maker has been my go-to companion in my kitchen for the past few weeks. As a coffee enthusiast who enjoys experimenting with brewing at home, I felt intrigued by this thermal carafe coffee maker‚Äîespecially with all its promises of superior brewing temperatures and versatile options. The product does have some impressive highlights, but also a few drawbacks that potential buyers should consider.

**Elegant Design Meets Practicality**

Immediately upon unboxing, I noticed the sleek combination of stainless steel and black finish. The modern aesthetic allows it to blend seamlessly into my kitchen space, giving off a premium vibe. Beyond its appearance, the compact dimensions‚Äî8‚Äù in depth, 10.63‚Äù in width, and 14.88‚Äù in height‚Äîmake it perfect for countertops without hogging all the space. I particularly appreciated the removable water tank feature as it makes refilling straightforward and mess-free. It‚Äôs one of those details that you don‚Äôt realize you need until you use it, and I loved not having to lug the entire coffee maker over to the sink.

**Brewing Precision That Impresses**

This coffee maker prides itself on precision brewing with a 200¬∞F optimal temperature. True to its claims, I‚Äôve been able to get consistently hot and flavorful coffee every morning. The thermal carafe keeps my coffee steaming for hours without burning it‚Äîa huge pro if you savor your coffee throughout a hectic morning. Whether brewing a full 10-cup pot or making a concentrated brew for iced coffee (which I especially enjoy in the summer), the result is impressively rich every time. The specialized iced coffee feature really won me over since it maintains the coffee‚Äôs strength even after being diluted with ice.

[Grab Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07b83dgmv/)

**Positives**

- Keeps coffee hot for hours thanks to vacuum-insulated carafe.
- Uniform and precise brewing temperature of 200¬∞F.
- Easy-to-fill and washable, removable water tank.
- Permanent stainless mesh filter that's reusable and eco-friendly.
- Sleek and modern aesthetic that fits most kitchen styles.

**Hiccups in the Experience**

As much as I‚Äôve enjoyed this coffee maker, it isn‚Äôt without its challenges. While the reusable mesh filter is a nice feature, cleaning it can become tedious over time, especially if you‚Äôre not a fan of scrubbing coffee grounds. Additionally, the time-saving mode, which is supposed to speed up brewing, still feels slightly sluggish when you‚Äôre in a rush to grab your morning cup. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that programming the machine initially took me a bit longer to figure out due to its less intuitive controls.

**Downsides**

- Mesh filter cleaning can feel like an extra chore.
- Speedy brewing mode isn‚Äôt as fast as expected.
- Controls may be slightly confusing for first-time users.

**How It Stands Against Competing Brands**

When comparing this machine to other market rivals, such as the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or Breville Precision Brewer, the thermal carafe stands out as a unique selling point. Unlike glass carafes that require constant heating on a hot plate (which often leads to bitterness), this design retains the coffee‚Äôs nuanced flavor profile. However, the lack of a warmer plate may not appeal to users who don‚Äôt consume coffee quickly and prefer traditional warming methods.

The brew quality truly rivals pricier alternatives, but its minor operational quirks keep it just slightly below in overall convenience compared to competitors like Technivorm Moccamaster, which boasts faster brewing and simpler programming. Nevertheless, if brew temperature and long-lasting thermal insulation are top priorities for you, this coffee maker gives some industry heavyweights a run for their money.

**Value for Money**

Looking at its features, I‚Äôd say the coffee maker justifies its price as a mid-range product. The fact that you get both functional versatility‚Äîlike the iced coffee-specific brewing‚Äîand long-term savings from the reusable mesh filter adds to its cost-effectiveness. While it may not be the cheapest option out there, it feels like a solid investment for anyone serious about enjoying a premium coffee experience at home or work.

I never saw any results.

I‚Äôve tried manifesting in different states, whether that be in full faith, nervousness, desperation, or calmness. Nothing.

Even with bigger manifestations (ex. A new job, a person) I would think from the desire and live as if I already had it in my life. Even if I felt it was effortless, natural, and fun, I never saw any results in the 3D, and more often than not, the opposite would happen (job rejections, person moves to another country, etc). None of the scenes I have ever visualized or inner conversations I‚Äôve had have come into play.

Being unnaturally cautious of your surroundings. It can occur due to trauma, psychological detriment induced by drugs or sleep deprivation/insomnia. I‚Äôve gone to many doctors, psychologists, therapists, monks, you name it. They all told me its my ‚Äúwiring ''. I wasn‚Äôt born with it, seeing things.Or maybe it was something I was born INTO. At a point of my life my view of the world was just like you and anyone on the street. It was around the age of 6 years old when I had come across a vexing scene that would be glued to my mind till death.
 I lived in a single story house with my family. My mom and my older siblings. My mom were renting it out until we could get our own place. It was rustic but inviting with its warm blend of tan walls and dark color furniture. Leather sofa and a nice carpet floor in the main living room with pearl white tiles to contrast on the walkway to the kitchen. There were only 2 rooms, so I shared  with my mom while my brothers got their room.I still was scared of sleeping alone so I would occasionally sleep with my mom in her bed. There was one portion of the house I tried my best to stay out of.  It was the garage. I didn‚Äôt know what the sensation was at the time,, but I was frozen. My body, in the door frame, is as still as pond water. I woke up that night with the urge to check the garage to see if I could find any of my old toys to bring into the house. They were kept in a large storage tote labeled as such ‚ÄúTOYS.‚Äù Instead of the toy storage, I was welcomed with the picture of a floating body, pale as clouds and transparent. I caught most of the details of the torso down; eerily smooth but a lifeless corpse. Every limb was intact. A ghost was in the garage. I knew what a ghost was around that time, even though I was still just a kid. I knew that a ghost was an angry spirit that had some need of haunting or revenge. So when this specter was floating before me, I felt terrified. Then as quick as it came it was gone. This began a sort of spiral into superstition for me.

However, it was one night that I woke up facing the ceiling, unable to move or talk. The layout in the darkness is still visible in my mind. I looked towards my bed in the corner of the room, the windows in the walls highlighted slightly by the moonlight. I couldn‚Äôt tell what time it was but the blue light coming through the window was alluring, begging my gaze. The almost adolescent size bed was tucked away in a small corner of the room I shared with my mother, since being 6 I didn‚Äôt have much to take up space. The window on ground level and further up towards the ceiling, the sun window‚Ä¶. with figures sprawled onto it. I will tell you this, I had never had a cold haze until then. Nothing worse or absolutely scathing to the young mind then your first sense of dread, panic, and fear.
You ever seen what you think is sasquatch latch onto a window overlooking you? It was a surprise seeing the cryptid myth so nimble and so abnormal. I had no concept of Sasquatch or any cryptid but using what I know now as an adult, that is the best way of describing. Bigfoot with the spider-man abilities to stick to surfaces and he chose the window overlooking the bed I occupied. Stalking me, frozen as I was. I had no clue what to do. It didnt move but I didn‚Äôt know if it could. I could only maintain my eyes on for so long, my brain racking in my skull screaming ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Blink, don‚Äôt Blink, don‚Äôt you dare blink.‚Äù
Try as I may, I couldn‚Äôt hold out, cursing myself as in that millisecond that the death of a fly could occur, it happened. BLINK. And I was back, and so was it. And so was another. The figure still sprawled out had a second shape by its left shoulder, it looked like a mosquito, or dragonfly. It wasn‚Äôt humanoid or bipedal but a shape. I hated bugs and still do to this day. I know what it was too, that damn episode of Spongebob where it had that butterfly close up. Somethings are not meant to observe in detail, as ignorance is bliss and knowledge is a curse. That simple cutaway with the bugs face, the bleak and goreful texture of its skin. If bugs even have skin. The sound, loud. A buzz like a death whistle, that damn Spongebob episode. Why they let that air, I will never know, but now here is what I can only imagine is the peak of disturbing insect at the window overlooking me. 
I had never asked anyone else about sleep paralysis, but I know that each is unique with each individual. I still recall the hot cold sweat I caught that night. I felt flush with a queasiness any giving moment to puke in response to the hallucinations. They jumped. Gone from the window. I didn‚Äôt even blink.
It‚Äôs one thing to witness something at a stalemate. You know if you keep your eyes tracked it won't move and you can fight all you can with all your heart to make sure they stay put. But they jumped. A sasquatch figure making a long jump at the speed to rival a bullet with its trusty dragonfly. Massive shapes around 6ft to 10ft tall, just gone before my very eyes. I don‚Äôt know what was more panic inducing, the motion of the jump and how the mind can even think of how a figure like those two that night can move, or the screen door to the backyard opening. 
I heard it, the brief scratch on its rail. Open and shut. The door might as well have squeaked in terror for me. I know they are in the house, I had to act. I tried to move my head or my arm but to no avail. I use the whimper of a dog to try and call out to my mother who was asleep right next to me. I was tearing up knowing I was so close to feeling safe again, the warmth of my protector. But nothing.  It sounded nothing more than a dry cough. I felt a headache out of sheer frustration. ‚ÄúCome on, please. Please talk. Please talk‚Äù I thought to myself My headache grew as I pleaded in my mind to cry out to my mother, she was sound asleep still. I was stuck. This room was to be my prison right here right now. I caught something that set me off. 
The room had a bathroom in it, but the sink was separated from the toilet and toiletries. Think like a high-end hotel. The sink was a separate counter just outside the door of the toilet room, just by the sink was the family dog, Sophie. Sophie was blind around this time, if I remember correctly, and she couldn't see. As is with humans, that meant her other sense were enhanced. It concerned me why her head shot up and looked towards the hall leading to the bedroom. Sophie was my loved friend, and I knew she would protect me if it wasn‚Äôt for the leash having her hold up in her bed so she wouldn't bump into anything while we slept, she was as helpless as I was. I shared her lament. We wanted out and asap. 
A dreary feeling was all I could interpret in this very moment. Praying that whatever it was that was on its way wasn‚Äôt going to harm us. Heaven forbids the beast kill me and my family. No, no it can't, it wasn't real so it can't kill my family. 
I blinked again
A marching thunder had traced the bed in 2 seconds. The sound was that of footsteps stamping the carpet on the floor quickly. They were tap dancing foot beats, yet the owner of the footsteps was a tall shape.  I could make out the head.
It reminded me vaguely of the Jim Carrey grinch head shape. That thin head end, looking cone shape. The short hairs protruding from the edge of its face. I couldn't make out its eyes but it was close enough to where it was obviously watching me. The tooth fairy isn't supposed to be caught mid act, else you gaze upon a strange mythical creature. One draped in beauty, mystique, and heartiful. The contrasting concept was breathing harshness right in front of me. I didn't know what heavy breathing sounded like, I couldn't tell if it was my mothers breath as she slept or the beast. Both idle moved as if they were taking deep breaths but only one sound. It‚Äôs shoulders rose and slumpt, not struggling but almost like its resisting. What urge? What demand? Can a demon even desire something like me? Why would it‚Ä¶?
I thought I was schizophrenic when I was around the age of 15. I talked a lot to myself and just phrased it as ‚Äúthinking out loud.‚Äù It wasn't until things would come and go around me as I went about my routines. Mostly at home and work, my mind was so occupied during school, and I had my friends to talk to. It only developed with time, things out of the corner of my eye became manifested thoughts. It's like daydreaming dialed up to 100. Being injected with a fervorous defect at birth, like I was, can be a corrosion to one's health. I wasn‚Äôt mentally ill, I just had an active imagination growing up. My understanding of life and fiction continued to rot my brain. I would think statues were watching me, that heads were turned to face me. Figures caught me in mirrors and glass only to not be there at all. My reflection gazed upon me only a fraction of a second earlier. 
I had a math class in high school near the beginning of the year, the class was massive in structure and space. The roof reached about 35 ft high. The space of the room was the same volume of ¬º a supermarket. That being said I had always gone absent minded during class. I never payed attention because I had found the teachers way of engaging the class boring and hostile. In my absent mindedness, I started to hear what sounded like the hearing test. The hearing test we‚Äôre way back in my elementary school days, the black truck trailer with the equipment inside and it was a narrow space with human sized booths with seats along the side of the trailer. I remember the matted walls, black like tar. I remember my one particular experience where I went in myself and recall the red and blue headset that would correlate with the ear they went on. Left was blue, the red was right. Once on, we were sat in the booths with our legs out and a curtain to cover our top half and sight. This was to prevent the person sitting across from you peeking at you to see when to push the button they gave you to indicate you heard the beeping. It all started to distort after about the second beep. I started to hear whispers in my memory. Very subtle at first, telling me when to push. So human and kind I thought it was some assistant helping me along with the test. I thought everyone was hearing it, so I just continued along, naive that the voices in my headset were not for more than an audience of one. 
It started again. But this time more aggressive. A raspy, hushed snarl. Like when you're mouthing off to someone being too loud in a library.
""NOW.""  I pushed the button. Then a slight giggle. Everything it said was breathy, it was telling a secret.
""NOW."" I pushed again. A black boot briskly left my sight as I directed my eyes just below the curtain that covered me. I only remember the heels that the testers wore. I don‚Äôt remember boots.
""LOOK AWAY."" I choked on my voice as I shot my head up and forward. I instinctively hit the button again because I heard the voice and thought it meant to hit the button.
""NO, NOT THAT."" I heard it say I grinded my teeth knowing I had messed up.  I stopped all together just to listen. Not for the beeping now, but for the voice. It was gone. Caught up in the drastic exchange I didn‚Äôt notice the curtain was opened before me.
The tester had made the gesture to take off the headset and she spoke. ‚ÄúHey Mijo, so it looks like you have to take the test again and you were part of the last group, I'm going to leave the curtain open for you since it‚Äôs going to be just you, okay? We are going to run the test again. Are you ready?‚Äù
I wanted to leave and come back another time. I wanted to tell her about the voices, but I had it in my head that I would get hurt if I spazzed out. So, I just nodded my head and she went up front to start the test. I sat in the booth; I looked down at the headset in my hands with my palms red from stress. I was gripping my hands in a panic so much they had turned redder than tomatoes. I tried to pat them against my thigh to ease them down.
I heard the tester say ‚ÄúOkay, you ready?‚Äù
I put on the headset and I said ‚ÄúOkay. Ready!‚Äù The test would typically last around 5 minutes for each group, ten if they thought the group needed extra evaluation. With that said I had felt the vibrations of footsteps exiting the trailer and out the door. I was alone in the trailer. 
The beeping started in my right ear first, so I began to count along with the length of the beep. 1, 2. 2 seconds. 2 second's right ear. Again in the left. 1,2. 2 seconds left ear. Now in both of my ears. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 7 Seconds in both ears. Weird. I thought how strange it was that both were longer. From the last test each beep was the same length throughout the test. Maybe they had to be sure with me? Not sure. Again, right ear. 1,2,3. Stop. 1,2,3,4,5. Stop. 
""B L I N K.""
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked as I did the action. The same boot that was caught under the curtain had now slipped its last bit into the booth next to me.
I stopped. Left ear. 1,2,3,4,5.
""S A M."" I blinked again, noticing another boot sliding into the booth to the left of me.
Now both. ""ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.""
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù in a whispering voice I called out to whoever was counting now. ‚ÄúHello? I'm here.‚Äù I said again, wondering if I could be saved from whatever was entrapping me.
The beep was played again. It sounded deafening, like it dug into my brain and was trying to claw its way out through my ears, then my eyes, then my forehead. A noise so piercing it felt like a parasite eating through me. Funny thing was I had taken off the headset when I called out.
""ONE."" A harsh, raspy voice said in my right ear. My neck almost whipped too fast for my head as I looked to the walls separating the booth to my right. My gaze trained on the carpet border between myself and the voice. In the darkness, I saw a figure reaching out to me from the space across from me just in my peripheral. I sucked in air like a vacuum and my eyelids were shot open.
""ONE."" It spoke.  Now from the left booth, I didn‚Äôt try to avert my gaze. It wasn‚Äôt as important as what I had thought was in front of me. ""ONE.""
‚ÄúNo! No!‚Äù I pleaded. It knew that if I didn‚Äôt look towards the voice, it could keep it up.
""ONE."" it was a repulsive seduction calling to me.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to!‚Äù fighting back all attempts to lure me in.
""SAM.""
I let up. I felt the need to peak out and to the let of the direction of the entrance. Towards the voice. The door to the trailer was shut and the only light illuminating was the computer desktop and the lightbulb just above it. The face had a smile very bright in the dark.
I reeled back into my booth and as soon as I did I heard the door open and shut again. CREAK, CREAK. ‚ÄúOkay, mijo! We‚Äôre all done. Just sit still and I‚Äôll come grab the headset.‚Äù
I felt sick. The tester came over and grabbed the headset. As she did, I heard her tell me ‚ÄúSo it looks like you are having some hearing troubles, okay? We can‚Äôt run it a third time so we are going to send you home with a call to your mom and see what your doctor can do. Okay, Mijo?‚Äù 
‚ÄúO-okay.‚Äù I replied. I got up and walked towards the front of the trailer slowly. The light from the doorway to outside now shining bright where I saw the crooked face in the dark. I looked intensely for the smile, or the eyes. Nothing. No shape, no form, no hint of it. I never like those hearing tests the same. From then on, I made sure to have an excuse to why I couldn‚Äôt. Ear infections, busy work. Anything to avoid the darkness of the trailer. And that smile in the dark.
I was lost in my memory, I had not thought about the booth for so long. So far apart had i wanted to rid myself of that incident but there I was, now tuned back into the math class many years later. That smile is still in my head. My attention now homed in on the lecture.
‚ÄúSam, can you tell me the formula I would use to solve this?‚Äù I looked up at the board and I realized I hadn‚Äôt written down anything of the notes the past 20 minutes.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, can I use the bathroom?‚Äù
‚ÄúDude, seriously?‚Äù he looked disappointed and annoyed.
I nodded and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an emergency.‚Äù He pointed to the door, and I was out.
I walked through the hall and the clouds formed in the sky like a Bob Ross painting, a shadowy black with gray tufts crowding the light that would shine on the world. Finally making it to the bathroom, I noticed it was empty. I could take as long as I could catching my breath in here. I sat, clothes still on and all, on the toilet for a good 3 minutes or 4. I felt overwhelmed being lost in my recollection of the booth. I was hit with a minor panic attack, ailing me. It covered so much, it made focusing on anything impossible. I felt my vision shake, my heart pounding and my breathing was sharp. I felt my chest jumping as I inhaled and exhaled through my nose, a marathon runners' desperation to breathe had caught me as my nail's dugs into my pants. 
Then, with the force of a soldier forced to stand attention, I froze. I heard a beep in my ears. The frequency that the hearing tests would use. I had no earbuds, there were no speakers in the stall or the bathroom for that matter. But there it was, the same violence of the migraine trying to claw my skull. I felt nauseous and my vision worsened. I tried to stand but my legs were jello and I almost fell to my knees. I braced myself and held myself up with the walls of the stall. I heaved and winced, in my effort to stabilize myself I attempted to unlatch the door to the stall but I couldn‚Äôt. My hands were shaking so much that you would think I had fish for fingers. I gave up and collapsed. My back pressed against one wall and my arms outstretched against it. I heard it again but only in my left ear. 1, 2. 2 seconds.

‚ÄúOnly 2 seconds, okay.‚Äù I said to myself. Although I was no longer by myself. No sound, no light from the outside, no sign of entry, I suddenly caught a pair of boots in the stall next to me. 

The bathrooms have automatic lights, if they don‚Äôt detect movement for some period of time they shut off to conserve power. I was unfortunate to find myself in that window of conservation, and the light in the bathroom, my saving grace, was snuffed out. Nothing more than pitch black darkness. It wasn‚Äôt break time, or passing period, so no one was expected to come in here for maybe another 40 minutes or so. I heard another beep playing in my right ear. 1,2. 2 seconds right ear. In my panic, I shot up and sat on the toilet seat again, trying my damndest to hide that I was in there. I sat my butt upwards on the seat and stretched my legs out on one of the walls of the stall. The beep played again. 1, 2, 3,
""FOUR, FIVE."" 
There it was, that harsh voice that demanded you acknowledge its authority. I shut my eyes, and covered my ears, hoping I can wait it out. I don‚Äôt know what I was waiting for, but it was better than that. 
""SAM.""
‚ÄúNo! Shut the fuck up!‚Äù I screamed. Fear overcame me. A wash of despair and uselessness filled my core to shake me like a blender. I was a pup stuck in a cage that had teeth. I was in the belly of a demon. I still heard footsteps of heavy worker boots through my hands on my ears. I was sweating, burning up, and feverish. I wanted out. I needed to get out.
""OPEN YOUR EYES."" It wanted me.
""OPEN YOUR EYES.""
It was fast and harsh still from all those years back. ""SAM.""
The beep now danced with the demon's voice as they both grew louder, like the devil himself calling me from hell. In a drastic moment of anger, my eyes shot open and stood up. I kicked the latch and the door opened. In the split second I saw it in the mirror, glaring at me. A hunter playing with its food. The eyes are bright and turquoise. The smile blended in with the darkness. No, it shaped the pitch black to gain form. The darkness was the demon, the smile was the void smiling at me. It twitched as if ready to open and show rows of blades in its mouth to devour me. I yelled and clenched a fist, I closed my eyes and lunged.
CRASH. My fist broke the mirror, connecting to the wall behind it. I released my breath through my teeth and stopped screaming. I heard the lights come on and I felt the warm and sharp pain in my hand. The blood trailing down to my forearm. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing!‚Äù my teachers voice rang. In my confusion, I opened my eyes and saw my teacher had just made his way into the bathroom.
‚ÄúStop staring, let's go to the nurse.‚Äù He looked to be in a mix of confused and annoyed. Like he was audible thinking to himself ‚ÄòThe fuck is wrong with this kid?‚Äô 
That week I was taken to a psychologist to be evaluated. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed but I was given a ‚Äòtalk buddy‚Äô to basically keep tabs on me. I was told the intent was to provide what I journal or diary couldn‚Äôt. Someone who would listen. I pleaded with the doctor and my mother that I would rather not, but my mother only seeing me as a shut-in decided, out of her own volition, that I needed to socialize more. I didn‚Äôt see this buddy in person often, it was mostly calls and texts to check, see what I did that day, how I was feeling, etc. We had decided to actually take time to see each other and meet up for a coffee. I agreed and the buddy seemed more than happy to. I had gotten his full name, Danny Porter, and he told me he was going to pull up in a black vans hoodie. I waited for him to come and once he did, I just stared at him.
‚ÄúHey Sam!‚Äù he called. Danny was a good man. He had helped me come to peace with some of my mental faults. He helped with some self confidence issues that I carried for a year or two. I really was so grateful for all he helped come to terms with. But it was always hard to look at him. I liked him more as just a voice, just an idea. It isn‚Äôt his own fault or his parent's fault that he had the same eyes and smile as a demon. 
I had eventually made it to my junior year of high school no problems except for the occasional anxiety of my future. I'm sure any teen has that headache of what their plans after graduation. Tests to ensure a good resume for any university, all the studying led to almost no free time at home and so I was bummed most of the time maintaining good sleep habits. After taking the S.A.TS, California assessment tests, or whatever college prep documents placed in front of me, I decided I had enough. If I can‚Äôt find my own free time to unwind and relax, I was going to make it myself.
My schedule looked like this; wake up at 6:40am to get ready, classes at  7am, lunch at 12pm, leave at 3p, homework until 6pm then dinner. I woul be done with dinner at around 7pm and then I would shower to get ready to study and then bed.  It would be 8:30pm by the time I decided I was through studying and even then I felt tired by that time. But not this night.
This particular night I decided I would stay up later than usual and hop on my game console. I was obsessed with Destiny 2 and Monster Hunter at the time, both games that require a lot of grinding and a lot of material farming in order to progress in power and game content. Monster Hunter especially. I would play for 3 hours initially going to bed at around 11:30 to sometimes midnight. I had concluded that I felt perfectly fine after doing this routine for a week. Eventually pushing my limit staying up until 2am, 3:30am at the latest.
Again seeing little to no effect on my well being and I was content balancing out my routine with school time with me time. I was so dumb and naive. I curse myself thinking I should‚Äôve known better. My mind was tricking my body the whole time Id run this routine, telling it that the very little sleep was sufficient when it wasn‚Äôt near the right amount of sleep. One night is when my body shut down. It was about 9pm, maybe 10pm but it was dark out for certain.
To give extra context, my room was a decent size, the window up to my chest leading out to the backyard, nothing more but screen mesh and curtains dividing me and the outside. I had my bed next to the window against the corner of the room and my nightstand next to my bed. I had actually been resting around this time. Feeling fatigued, I made the conscious choice to just call it in earlier than usual. So much so that I actually almost fell asleep with the light on‚Ä¶almost. I felt my eyes grow heavy when a sudden screech of a banshee put me in a stasis. It was distant and slightly faint. It came from my window. The curtains almost fully covering the window now felt like a shielding from a horror. A ghastly feeling took over me, the scream was coming from the mountains near the house. We lived near the foothills, less than a 10-minute walk away.
The scream sounded like a womans, she was in pain or in fear. It was the dying cries of a woman. I didn‚Äôt know if it was my mind or if there was actually a woman crying out for hell but I knew it would be too late if I even bothered to get involved. So I just shut the window over the mesh, turned off the lights, and went to bed.  That scream was on replay for the time I was trying to sleep. It was 1:00am by the time I fell asleep and woke up not too long after at 3:40am. I was stuck. My body unable to move, my arms at my side and the covers acting more as a restraint than simply covers. Before I had gone to sleep I remember I had turned on my led lights I'd set up 2 days before. I would choose before sleep a blue color or a red. That night I chose red and tuned the brightness down. just a tad so it wasn‚Äôt lighting up my face like a tomato. The rest of my room was illuminated crimson. The rest of the room being my tv and my dresser facing opposite of me in bed. The dresser was a normal 6 drawer dresser with a mirror attached to the top half of it. My vision still red from the lights lighting the room like a velvet filter. The red that would usually tuck me away to sleep now was showing me something that I pray everyday is no longer barred to me. 
 
Catholics and Mexican culture mesh like peanut butter and jelly when it comes to superstition. Tales of old warnings of omens and gateways for demons to enter our lives. Wives tales from Mexico that guided some ,who were so spiritual, on how to live life. Salt over the shoulder, pray before sleep, and don‚Äôt have mirrors in your room. In my state of sleepless nights, I had developed an overactive imagination. At least thats how I came to terms with it. I had been stuck at an angle in my sleep, my head tilted slightly to where I can barely catch the mirror. From there I tried to make out the reflection of myself in bed. The mirror wasn‚Äôt reflecting me. Instead, it was black. Like an abyss. From the abyss‚Ä¶came devils.  

A shadowy hand started to crawl it‚Äôs way out from behind the mirror. It looked like a claw. I couldn't make out details but they were elongated. I could make out claws but that was it. Was it scaley? Wet? Maybe even‚Ä¶fleshy? I don't know. It stretched for a second before I saw a head make its way out from behind the mirror after the hand. Then another arm. The shadowy figure was crawling out from the mirror and the mirror was still an abyss. And I was helplessly frozen. This demon figure had made it‚Äôs way  from the dark pit of the Devil‚Äôs playground into my room. It kept crawling upwards toward my ceiling and as it did, the led lights were blinking rapidly. I had done the motion and felt my eyelids close but I still saw everything. Thats probably the biggest downside to sleep paralysis, you can shut your eyes, breath and plead with every ounce of your body. Try as you may, it‚Äôs all in your head. My brain was putting it in my sight that it knew the demon was still there and making its way towards me. It reminded me of the witch from Left from Dead 2 the way it looked so malnourished and that long hair draping its face like a mask. It crawled onto the wall adjacent to my bed and in moments was latched onto the wall, inches away from my face. I was a fly caught in a spider web facing down my captor. I had forced my body to muster up some energy to barely tilt my head towards the wall to try and wake myself up. The demon did not like that. In a black flash it shot forward in front of my eyes again and swung its claw at my face. 

My eyes shot open. I felt my lungs begging for air like an addict. My whole chest, a jackhammer ringing loudly. My heart was pounding erratically so much it felt like my ribs were going to fracture. It was cold, and I felt my eyes were dry. My whole body was shaking in terror. I learned my lesson that day. A harsh lesson. To this day I have my L.E.DS disconnected and from time to time debated on cutting the mirror half of the dresser. I keep a line of salt lining the bottom and the top of the mirror thinking that would be enough. I still find myself spacing out during the day staring into my reflection. It took me some time to stare into my reflection at night out of fear but I had done it later on. It was just a normal night unlike the one night where the demonic event transpired. Thinking this night was nothing special I decided to test my theory the one and only time. I closed the curtains and turned off any and all lights in the room. I had stood at the mirror for ten minutes and then it happened. In the darkness I had seen the turquoise eyes and the void smile of dark perversion. It wasn‚Äôt next to me but instead looked to be where my nightstand was. I took my phones flashlight and shined it on the space where the eyes were. Nothing. I looked back toward the mirror and it was still there. In a final test I turned off the flashlight but kept the camera flash on. I took a picture. I wish I hadn‚Äôt There in the capture I saw it all in the mirror. The turquoise eyed evil on the left side of the bed. The Mirror demon on the wall to the right. The salt was useless.
They were already in the house.

I have had these episodes of hysterics and hallucinations documented and reported to my psychologist. I was evaluated again not too long ago and the results came back. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with schizophrenia but with a form of ADHD or minor fuid discharge in the brain. I was told I was a unique case, the serotonin in my system would have an overflow in my blood and my body, in response to the overflow, would discharge only the filled portions into my gut and then it would find its way to my brain. Some science shit like that or something.  I wasn‚Äôt 100% paying attention but all I got from that was the prescription for medicine that would regulate the amount produced, like mood stabilizers. After a year of taking the meds, I saw the effects taking place and less and less of ‚ÄòDemons.‚Äô I was grateful.

I could sleep. I could think. And regardless of the stoic face I had most of the time, sometimes barely able to be overexpressed with excitement, I was glad I could lead my life from here on out. I was getting ready for bed one night and I had just showered and gotten dressed. I was over the sink brushing my teeth and then rinsed. I looked over the prescription meds and popped the cap. I took the regulated 2 capsules for the night and downed it with some of the faucet water. As soon as I reeled up to the mirror, I saw my eyes. They were turquoise. A cold dagger of a chill ran down my back and I gripped the sink counter like a vice. ‚ÄúWhat the fu-‚Äù I was cut off. The lights in the bathroom went out and I was in the darkness facing the mirror. My eyes were back to the normal and I felt only a split-second relief and then fear struck again. My eyes were normal‚Ä¶but the eyes behind me were turquoise‚Ä¶

We‚Äôve all heard how important sleep is ‚Äî but for women, especially, the effects of sleep deprivation run deeper than just needing coffee. Hormones, mental load, and multitasking amplify the consequences.

And yes, it‚Äôs backed by science.

 **What the Research Says**  
Studies show that women tend to need more sleep than men due to more complex brain activity (yep, multitasking has a cost). And when we don‚Äôt get enough:

* Mood regulation takes a hit ‚Üí more anxiety, irritability, and emotional reactivity
* Hormonal balance gets disrupted ‚Üí affecting periods, appetite, and energy
* Memory and focus suffer ‚Üí brain fog is real
* Immune function drops ‚Üí you're more likely to get sick

 **Why Women Feel It Differently**  
Sleep impacts the HPA axis (stress response system), and in women, that system is more sensitive. Lack of sleep messes with cortisol levels, which can make PMS worse, increase sugar cravings, and trigger emotional crashes.

It also disrupts melatonin and estrogen balance ‚Äî which can affect everything from skin health to fertility.

**Real Talk from Women**  
‚ÄúI used to wear sleep deprivation like a badge of honor. Once I prioritized 7-8 hours, my mood and energy completely changed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter one week of poor sleep, my cycle went off. My skin broke out. Everything felt harder.‚Äù

  
Sleep isn‚Äôt optional ‚Äî it‚Äôs foundational.  
Women‚Äôs brains and bodies are wired differently, and sleep is essential for hormonal balance, mental clarity, and emotional resilience.

1m94f3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1m94f3k/explore_brita_everyday_water_filter_pitcher/,Explore Brita Everyday Water Filter Pitcher Review Does It Truly Remove Lead Effectively?,"The Brita OB46/OB06 Everyday Elite Water Filter Pitcher has been a staple in my daily routine for over a month now, and I‚Äôve got some thoughts to share. Initially, I wasn‚Äôt one to pay much attention to filtered water, but as I started prioritizing the quality of what I consume, this pitcher quickly became a household essential. Designed for everyday convenience, it promises cleaner and tastier water while reducing contaminants significantly. But does it really live up to the hype? Here‚Äôs my personal experience with it, including the good, the bad, and everything in between.

**Design and Build**  
The sleek and compact design of this pitcher immediately caught my eye. It‚Äôs simple yet functional, fitting snugly into the tightest corners of my refrigerator. The white BPA-free plastic exterior gives it a modern and minimalistic look, while the lightweight structure makes it easy to carry around, even when filled. What stood out to me was the flip lid, which makes refills incredibly convenient. No unnecessary fumbling or disassembling is required; just a quick flip and pour. The 10-cup capacity is perfect for my family, comfortably filling three reusable 24-ounce water bottles in one go. For those who are particular about measurements, its dimensions (10.95 x 10.83 x 6.06 inches) are ideal for most fridge spaces.

**Performance: Water Quality and Contaminant Reduction**  
I tested this pitcher with both tap water and bottled water to see if I could genuinely taste a difference. The results were undeniable. The Brita Elite filter included with the pitcher reduces 99% of lead and eliminates other contaminants like chlorine (for taste and odor), cadmium, asbestos, and mercury. Ever since I started using it, I feel confident knowing my family‚Äôs water is significantly safer and healthier. The Advanced Carbon Core Technology in the filter performs impressively, tackling more contaminants than competitors like PUR or ZeroWater. I‚Äôll admit, it even made my coffee and tea taste better.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Using this pitcher doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore, which is crucial for anyone with a busy schedule. The electronic SmartLight indicator is perhaps one of its best features, alerting me when it‚Äôs time to replace the filter. The light changes color based on filter usage, removing all guesswork. The Brita Elite filter lasts roughly six months or 120 gallons, which means fewer replacements and greater cost-effectiveness over time. The pitcher‚Äôs components are easy to disassemble for cleaning, and since I used a soft sponge, the plastic hasn‚Äôt scratched or dulled.

**Advantages**  
There are several noteworthy positives when it comes to this pitcher. A few of my favorite ones include:  
- Significant contaminant reduction (99% lead, benzene, asbestos, and more).  
- SmartLight filter change indicator for effortless reminders.  
- Long-lasting filters (replace twice a year, on average).  
- Compact, fridge-friendly design that‚Äôs sturdy yet lightweight.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
As much as I enjoy using this water filter, it‚Äôs not entirely perfect. Here are a few critiques:  
- The lid can sometimes feel a bit flimsy, which makes me cautious during refills.  
- Filling the pitcher to its maximum capacity takes time because I wait for the filter to process water completely.  
- Replacement filters are somewhat pricier compared to similar products on the market.  

**Product Comparisons**  
After some research and comparing to competitors such as PUR and ZeroWater, I can confidently say the Brita model has its strengths. While PUR pitchers are often commended for their ergonomic spouts, Brita stands out for its SmartLight technology and lead reduction capabilities. ZeroWater does filter out more contaminants overall; however, its slower filtration speed and bulkier design make it less appealing for daily family use. The moderate price point of the Brita also gives it the edge for me, as it balances functionality with affordability.

**Price Performance**  
This pitcher delivers excellent value for the price, especially considering the advanced filtering capabilities. While you may find other pitchers that promise similar results, the Brita stands out for its consistent performance and user-friendly features. The cost of replacing filters every six months is justifiable when weighed against the environmental and health benefits. It has reduced my reliance on single-use plastic bottles, which is a win for both my wallet and the planet.

Review Inside!,"Launching into my experience with the PUREPLUS PP-RWF0700A refrigerator water filter, it didn‚Äôt take long to notice this wasn‚Äôt an ordinary replacement filter. I‚Äôve been reliant on filtered water for everything from brewing my morning coffee to keeping my water pitcher filled, and trust me‚ÄîI've gone through my fair share of water filters. This product, designed as a replacement filter compatible with Samsung models, truly showcased its strengths in multiple aspects while revealing a few small quirks along the way. Regularly using this filter gave me a clear insight into what it brings to the table and where it might falter slightly.

**Build Quality and Design**  
The first thing I noticed when handling the PUREPLUS PP-RWF0700A water filter was how solid and well-made it felt. Its lead-free material and natural coconut activated carbon construction immediately gave me confidence in its durability and effectiveness. Let me say, swapping it into my Samsung refrigerator model RF28HFEDBSR was a breeze, thanks to the precise fit. Unlike other filters I‚Äôve tried that required multiple adjustments, this one slid right in without any drama. The compact dimensions (2""D x 2""W x 8.8""H) made the entire process smooth, and I wasted no time worrying about compatibility.

**Performance Capabilities**  
Daily use provided a close look at this product‚Äôs filtration abilities. The manufacturer highlights that the filter reduces 99% of chlorine, and I can vouch that the water tasted cleaner. This might just be the smoothest my morning coffee has ever tasted. Additionally, it retains beneficial minerals, which is reassuring for someone who‚Äôs health-conscious. Its innovative multi-layer filtration grabbed my attention; the 0.5-micron inner layer even meets Particular Reduction Class I standards and caters to concerns like benzene, mercury, and PFOA. Although I didn‚Äôt pull out a lab kit to confirm all reductions, the overall difference in water taste was evident. 

**Highlights**  
- Certified by NSF/ANSI 42 and 372 for safety and reliability  
- Effectively removes chlorine, increasing water‚Äôs taste quality  
- Multi-layer filtration ensures a healthier, more enjoyable drinking experience  
- Long-lasting performance; filters last up to six months under regular use  
- Compatible with an impressive range of Samsung models

**Potential Shortcomings**  
While very effective, I did notice a slight reduction in the water flow rate, especially compared to some original filters I‚Äôve used. After extended use, the pressure seemed to dip a bit faster than expected, though it didn‚Äôt greatly impact my daily needs. Another observation was the lack of a recycling program for the used cartridges; I prefer when filters come with eco-friendly disposal options.  

- Slightly slower water flow rate compared to other filters  
- Lacks an eco-conscious recycling solution for cartridges  

**Product Rivals in the Market**  
Comparing this product to other competing brands like Waterdrop and Icepure reveals some interesting distinctions. Waterdrop does offer equally strong filtration and slightly better flow rate, but PUREPLUS wins in terms of its multi-layer design and mineral retention. On the other hand, Icepure provides budget-friendly options but doesn‚Äôt match the certifications and overall performance of this filter. The enhanced taste provided by PUREPLUS gives it an edge for anyone prioritizing flavor over cost alone.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
In the realm of filtering performance versus cost, this product strikes an amicable balance. Given the high level of filtration and superior build quality, it‚Äôs easy to say it fits into the ‚Äúworth every penny‚Äù category. It might lean slightly on the pricier side for some users due to its certifications and multi-functional design, but you‚Äôre securing clean, safe water for months without needing frequent replacements.

1m94br5,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m94br5/discover_baemin_acrylic_appliance_slider_review/,Discover Baemin Acrylic Appliance Slider Review Smooth Kitchen Organization and Countertop Movement,"The Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 Acrylic Appliance Slider has been a game-changer in my kitchen routine, acting as the unsung hero for managing those bulky countertop appliances. From the moment I unwrapped this sleek, clear sliding tray, I realized how much easier my mornings could become. As someone who relies heavily on their coffee maker and air fryer, the convenience of smoothly pulling these appliances out from under cabinets without straining or scratching the countertop has been a delight.

**Build and Quality**  
The high-quality acrylic material used in this product not only gives it a durable yet lightweight feel, but it also scores points for aesthetic appeal. Its sleek transparency blends seamlessly with my kitchen decor, and it exudes sturdiness when in use. The silent rubber wheels? Absolute genius. I was initially skeptical, wondering if the wheels would leave marks or skid uncomfortably on my countertops, but they exceeded my expectations. Every glide feels smooth and controlled, with no need for extra effort. Plus, the screws are firmly in place thanks to the well-thought-out nut fixing system, which ensures added durability.  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this sliding tray feels ridiculously easy. Its ergonomic handle makes gripping a breeze, particularly when I need to pull out my air fryer after a long day of work when all I want is a hassle-free meal prep experience. Keeping the tray clean hasn‚Äôt been an issue either. A quick wipe-down always does the trick, and the included cable organizer keeps the cord mess under control.  

**Versatility and Applications**  
The size options are a real bonus here. I opted for the 14 x 9.8-inch model, given its suitability for my stand mixer and coffee machine. I later realized that its versatility goes beyond just those appliances. It easily accommodates larger kitchen gadgets like blenders, rice cookers, and even my compact instant pot. It feels like no appliance in my kitchen is off-limits with this sliding tray.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and durable acrylic construction blends beautifully with kitchen decor.  
- Quiet, rubber wheels provide smooth sliding without scratching countertops.  
- Ergonomic handle design ensures an effortless appliance-moving experience.  
- Comes with a cable organizer for added convenience.  

[Check Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0dmssb4l5/)

**Shortcomings**  
While I'm a fan of how this product functions, I did notice a couple of minor drawbacks. First, the tray feels slightly bulky when navigating a smaller kitchen with limited counter space. Additionally, although the wheels are silent and smooth, they don‚Äôt perform as well on textured countertops, which could be a challenge for some users.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Bulkiness might not sit well with kitchens featuring limited counter space.  
- Slightly less effective on textured countertop surfaces.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other kitchen appliance sliders I‚Äôve tried, this model stands out in terms of material quality and wheel design. Cheaper fabric-based sliders tend to leave scratches over time or wear out, but the acrylic base and rubber wheels here ensure durability. Models like the XYZ Plastic Appliance Mover are comparably priced but lack the user-friendly features, such as an ergonomic handle or cable organizer. That said, some competitors offer better adaptability to textured surfaces, which could be worth considering for specific countertop types.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When evaluating the price of this product against its features, the balance leans heavily in its favor. Its durability, combined with the thoughtful design elements, makes the investment worthwhile. While some might find the initial cost slightly higher than thinner plastic or fabric-based sliders, the difference in functionality and ease of use is significant, making this a smarter purchase in the long run.

I wanted to share something I‚Äôve found super helpful for couples in the early planning stages: a list of thoughtful *non-obvious* questions to ask yourselves to get clearer on what you actually want your elopement day to *feel* like ‚Äî not just what it should *look* like.

  
Whether you're dreaming up something abroad, off-grid, or just want something more intentional, these might help spark some new ideas:

üó∫Ô∏è **1. Do you want to feel rooted in nature, culture, or a sense of nostalgia?**  
Some couples want epic views, some want a meaningful return to a favorite place, and others just want peace and privacy. Start with what lights you up.

üìÖ **2. Do you want your ceremony to be the** ***start*** **of the day‚Ä¶ or the grand finale?**  
There's no rule! Sunrise vows followed by coffee in the mountains? Or a slow morning, then a sunset ceremony and stargazing?

üì∑ **3. What types of moments do you most want to remember in 10 years?**  
Big landscapes, intimate vows, cooking dinner together, dancing in a field? These can help shape what gets prioritized in the timeline.

üéí **4. How adventurous do you actually want to get?**  
A 6-mile hike sounds romantic until it‚Äôs 90 degrees with elevation gain ‚Äî so define your version of ‚Äúadventure.‚Äù

üåé **5. Is there a place or landscape that feels symbolic to your story or values?**  
Maybe it‚Äôs where you met, your first trip together, or a place you‚Äôve always dreamed of. Emotional connection > Pinterest-worthy.

üé• **6. Are you bringing guests, or making this** ***just*** **for you two?**  
There are beautiful ways to include friends/family ‚Äî or not ‚Äî but it helps to get honest about what feels good for your personalities.

üï∞Ô∏è **7. Do you want a full-day experience or a quick ceremony?**  
Your elopement can be more than 30 minutes ‚Äî it can be an entire intentional adventure.

üí¨ **8. Are you introverted or extroverted ‚Äî and how will that affect your day?**  
Introverts might want more quiet pauses and space. Extroverts might love dancing in the street in a foreign city.

üå± **9. What parts of this process are most overwhelming to you right now?**  
(If you name it, it‚Äôs easier to get support.)

üóíÔ∏è **10. What ‚Äúrules‚Äù do you want to break?**  
No bouquet, no first look, no white dress? You get to define it all.

Would love to hear from couples planning now ‚Äî are there questions you wish someone had asked you earlier? Or something you're wrestling with decision-wise? Happy to offer feedback or share location ideas if you're stuck!",1,1753462063.0,ElopementPlanner,0,1.0,False

1m948kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1m948kb/trip_report_24_days_solo_backpacking/,Trip report- 24 days solo backpacking,"
I (33 F) did a 24 days solo trip to Japan from India last month and cannot stop thinking about how amazing it was. This is my Japan trip report: some highlights and recommendations

My route was the following

Tokyo- Takayama- Shirakawago- Kanazawa- Kyoto- Osaka- Hiroshima- Miyajima- Tokyo

 

Tokyo

Try keeping a good amount of time in Tokyo as its very big and to get from one place to another, it can sometimes take 30-60 mins. I stayed here for a week and felt I barely scratched the surface.

During my week‚Äôs stay I did the following-Kichioji, Yanaka  Ginza, Asakusa, Ginza (shopping day), Shibuya, Shinjuku, Day trip to Kamakura and team labs+ last day shopping.

I based myself at Asakusa as there were plenty of hostels and the accommodations were much cheaper compared to Ginza but I do recommend either Asakusa or ginza over staying at Shibuya or Shinjuku.

My favourite things were to explore Kichioji and yanaka. I just aimlessly walked around and had a great time. Definitely go to bar woody in Kichioji . It also had my favourite Uniqlo store. I did a one day food tour by Urban adventures and had a great time. Would recommend. 

Tayori restaurant in Yanaka ginza - have their set lunch menu- it was one of my fav meals of the trip. You can also explore the touristy areas of Shinjuku and Shibuya. I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of these places but should check it out once. Cool to walk around golden gia and get a couple of drinks but I felt it was skippable.

As my sister is an artist, I did a lot of stationary shopping and let me tell you, Japan has the best stationary in the world.
 Fav stationary shops- Itoya, Seikaido, hands, Gekkoso and Loft. Seikaido was the cheapest(and best) and followed by itoya. I also picked up a lot from daiso and the quality was good for its price.

ABC mart is the best place to shop for shoes. Look out for their discounted shoes. 

 

Takayama

Personally I was a bit underwhelmed with this place, but I do not regret visiting it as it was still a very cool experience.

Stayed at- Guest House Ouka and I feel this was the best hostel I have ever stayed at. Very affordable, good location, just 5 mins away from the bus station and the host was very warm and the entire set up of the hostel was very homely and fantastic.

Took a bus from Shinjuku express station for 8000 yen to Takayama- took around 6 hours. You can also take a bullet train. I really enjoyed the bus rides in Japan. Felt they were much cheaper and always took just a couple of hours extra, so if you have some time to spare then definitely go for buses over trains for short journeys. They would stop over at these cute supermarkets. I enjoyed shopping for random food items at these places.

My highlight in Takayama was the Takayama Showakan Musuem- it‚Äôs a very cool retro kind of museum where you are encouraged to touch things and play the video games.

One disadvantage about Takayama was that everything shut early. Many of the main places or street restaurants shut as early as 430pm. I felt a lot of it was build for the day trip tourists. You will still manage to find places for dinner but go early for dinner at 7 as most places shut very early here.

One of my fav bars in Japan was here in Takayama called ‚Äì Cinq- very small, cute garage turned bar run by a nice man- had the best negroni over here

I had the best ramen at- Kofune ‚Äì soba noodle shop

Defintely do the Higashiyama walking course- its like a mini hike of 5.5kms which takes you to several temples. I would highly recommend it even if you aren‚Äôt interested in the temples as the trail is very pretty and not crowded at all.

You can also do a day trip to Kamikochi- very good hikes. Overall, I think I wouldn‚Äôt have missed out a lot if I skipped Takayama.

I did a day trip to Shirakawago as it came on my route to Kanazawa. The tickets costed 2800 yen from Takayama to Shirakawago and then another 2800 yen from shirakawago to Kanazawa. The journey to shirakawago is very pretty and takes around 50 mins.

Personally I felt shirakawago was quite touristy, but it was extremely beautiful and felt like a small European village. You can easily explore the place within 3-4 hours. My suggestion is to go as early as possible because post 11-12, a lot of tourists come for day trips.

 

Kanazawa

This place was the HIGHLIGHT of my Japan trip. Very cool city and easy to navigate.

Stayed at- Torifito Hotel and pod Kanazawa- it was a cool pod hotel and I highly recommend it. It was very cheap and even had an onsen and sauna with a lot of amenities.

Kanazawa has lots of museums and art galleries and gardens. The best garden of Japan is in Kanazawa. Take a cultural pass which costs 1000 yen and you get entry to 16 places for 2 days. It was completely worth it even if you visit 3-4 places in 2 days. I‚Äôd suggest keeping at least 2 days in Kanazawa as there is a lot to explore.

My highlights were- Kenrokuen  garden, Nomura ke samurai house, 21st century museum of contemporary art, DT Suzuki museum, Nagamachi district, Kanazawa Noh museum, Yoshiro and Yoshio Taniguchi museum

Go to Kissa kishi caf√©- it was my fav caf√© in japan. It‚Äôs owned by this old lady who has a very cute cat and she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. Have toast butter and coffee there. and sit for a long time to just relax. She even gives out a free bookmark.

Go to ‚Äì Hacchouya Kanazawa ekimae- it was one of my fav meals- very good izakaya, a bit pricey but completely worth it.

Bar noivoi- for Italian food. Needs reservations.

Kanazawa also has cool bars- can go to some of the standing bars where the salary men go to. Good nightlife. I would highly highly recommend Kanazawa to everyone.

 

 
KYOTO

You can take a bus or train from Kanazawa to Kyoto. I took a bus because it was almost half the price of the train, however it takes around 5 hours while the train takes around 2.5-3 hours. The train costs 8200 yen. While the bus was 4000 yen.

I stayed in Guest house chita and I really liked it. It‚Äôs a Japanese style house where I took a private room. Costed me around 5000-6000 yen per night.

Kyoto is known for its temples, but I‚Äôd suggest selecting top 3-5 temples you want to do and do them or else you will get very overwhelmed or bored with temples.

I did Higashiyama Jisho ji temple which was absolutely beautiful. Otagi nenbutsuji temple- very cool. Next to arashiyama bamboo forest

Kyoto in general is very crowded so makes sense to start as early as possible. Divide your days into the areas of Kyoto eg- day 1- northern Kyoto, day 2 ‚Äì eastern Kyoto etc.

I did Fushimi inari at 8pm which was amazing but better to go with someone and not completely alone as it can feel a bit eerie at night plus lots of boars so go with someone.

My favourite temple in Kyoto was Sanjusangendo temple- it has like 1000 statues made of gold. Do visit. Its next to Kyoto Museum which was fantastic 

Walk or cycle around the kamo river. Very peaceful

I didn‚Äôt do this, but I saw that a lot of people recommended GEAR ‚Äì it‚Äôs a nonverbal theatre. 

Have food at Nishiki market- its touristy and crowded but still worth it. The food was fantastic and definitely have the 100-yen sake. Its fun. Even the matcha icecream with pancakes was super cool.

As I said, Kyoto has many things and temples to choose from so select just a few and do them well instead of trying to do them all. Be prepared for it to be crowded and touristy but some parts are really nice. There are tea ceremonies, knife making workshop etc in Kyoto so can check them out.

 

 

Osaka

I just did a day trip here but I‚Äôd recommend to spend 2-3 days here if you are interested in nightlife, ninetendo, shopping or just a more city vibe. I wasn‚Äôt, so I skipped it.

Just went for a day which was absolutely fine as I got to see Osaka at night which was super cool, shopped at a couple of places and tried the ichiran ramen which was ok .

If you are going from Kyoto to Osaka, do not take a bullet train as it barely saves 15 mins but is more expensive. Rather take the rapid train which will get you to Osaka in 30-45 mins. It‚Äôs a very easy travel.

 

 

HIMEJI

I went from Kyoto to Hiroshima while making a stop over at himeji. I recommend it if you are interested in castles and history plus it‚Äôs a cool place to visit.

I took a train from Kyoto to himeji which costed me around 2210 yen.

Put your luggage at the coin locker and walk towards the castle. Id advice to start early like at 8am. See the himeji castle and the garden- there is a combo ticket available. The garden- Koko en is very nice so don‚Äôt miss it.

Go to Benkei for lunch- it was my fav lunch- very good sushi. The place is run by an old couple and they do a set lunch for 2000 yen which includes 8 pieces of sushi, tea, bowl of soup, salad and some fruits. It comes on the way to the castle. So you can either do it post or before the castle depending on the time.

Keep atleast 3-5 hours to explore himeji (at ease) and then make your way to Hiroshima. I took a bullet train for 7910 yen for 59mins.

 

HIROSHIMA

Hiroshima was my other fav place in Japan. A true highlight. Generally people do a day trip to Hiroshima which I do not recommend at all. Atleast stay for 2 nights. I stayed for 4 and it was great. I really feel its important to do this city if you can. It was expensive to travel to and I almost thought of skipping it but I am so happy I did it.

The museum is a must. A very very important place and I recommend to keep atleast 2-3 hours for it as it can be very emotionally draining. There are a couple of other museums or spots around that you can do.

Hiroshima is known for okonomiyaki- Japanese pancakes so definteley have them here. You can go to Okonomimura- it‚Äôs a 4 floors building where everyone does this dish so select a place at random and enjoy

I highly recommend doing a day trip to Miyajima. Before going, check the high and low tide timings. So you can see the main shrine at both.

Take a tram from Hiroshima st- takes an hour- trams are slow- if you want something faster- you can take a train to Miyajima station and then a ferry which costs 200 yen plus tourist tax of 100 yen and lasts for 10 mins.

Once you reach Miyajima, go and see the Itsukushima shrine- the main big tori gate and go to the Itsukushima jinja. Then make your way to either explore the markets or if interested, climb the mount misen. It takes around 2-3 hours or you can take a ropeway for 1100 yen one way or 2000 for both the way. Id suggest, if you have a bit of time then take the cable ropeway up one way and then hike down. The trail is beautiful and will take around 1.30 hours to get down. From the ropeway you gotta climb around 20 mins uphill to go to the observatory deck which is a must. Very beautiful view. Then while making your way down, you can explore some temples.

Miyajima is known for its oysters so try them. and even their Lemon beer. Its really nice but do it after your hike. You can also have the icecream- I had the best looking icecream there where the guy put up wafers of tori gate and deer.

Oh Miyajima has many deer just like nara but here you cannot feed them so keep your distance and admire them from a distance.

Try out the maple leaf shaped desert- it has many flavours- I really liked the custard and lemon flavour.

Miyajima had a lot to do but things shut by 4pm so plan things accordingly. I first explored everything and then hiked. When I got back, most of the restaurants were shut. The last ferry leaves at 1030 pm.

 

Overall it was a fantastic trip, and I managed to do it within 2400 USD for 24 days(without shopping but including everything else) which I felt was great. I budgeted everything quite well. The most I spent was on food which was so worth it. I stayed mostly in hostels, had tonnes of 711 smoothies for breakfast, used buses and only 2 bullet trains, had some fancy wagyu beef meals too. June was mostly rainy but by the end it got quite hot.
I travelled by ANA airlines and it was a great experience.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Hope this report helps üòä

1m9489s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m9489s/my_dad_ate_meat_from_a_deer_that_walked_on_two/,My Dad ate meat from a deer that walked on two legs. Now he‚Äôs acting kinda strange.,"The party was two weeks ago. I stole a few beers when the adults weren‚Äôt looking and shared them with Lucy Sitkins away from the crowd. She drank hers greedily as we sat beneath the bough of a low tree, speaking low so no passers-by could hear. Every time we whispered, we tilted our faces a little closer and closer. There was a moment where I thought she was going to rest her head on my shoulder as she told me about how she wanted to be a vet, and my heart skipped as I debated putting my arm around her waist.¬†

It was all cut short when her father, Larry, stood in front of everyone in the party and forced a beer can down his throat. I didn‚Äôt see it. I only heard the cries that had us both sitting upright beneath the branches. By the time we got back to the party the adults were escorting the kids away and ambulance sirens were fast approaching. Dad was there and he told me to take my little sister home. The grim and frightening look on his face made me forget Lucy and the smell of beer on her breath. I try hard to remember if she ate from the barbecue. Sometimes I think she didn‚Äôt, other times I swear I can picture her biting into a burger and it‚Äôs so vivid I think it must be a memory. It‚Äôs moot either way. I‚Äôll never see her again.¬†

I felt a little gross when I went into school the next day and asked around if the stories about her dad were true. When my father got home the night of the party, he hadn‚Äôt spoken to me or Mom. He just went to bed and didn‚Äôt tell us what happened. Come morning, I saw some of the older kids by the school gates and overheard them talking. The details made my stomach churn, but I wanted to know more. I didn‚Äôt want to act all excited about something terrible, but this felt like the kind of thing people would be talking about for years.¬†

Larry Sitkins had swallowed a beer can.¬†

*‚ÄúShoved it down his throat like a fucking boa constrictor eating an egg!‚Äù*¬†

At least that‚Äôs how one kid described it to me. There was more, of course. He‚Äôd praised Satan before slitting his own throat. Gotten piss drunk and fallen hard onto the ground while chugging a beer. Tried to catch the can mid-air. Someone had punched him mid-sip. There were a lot of variations on what happened and how, but they were only theories that got turned into rumours. A lot of us were just trying to make sense of it. Larry was a pretty run-of-the-mill guy. He was a landscaper who made lame jokes at kids‚Äô birthday parties. He was about as non-descript as they came, at least as far as a bunch of teenagers were concerned.¬†

We got halfway through the day before Mr Straub shut the bleachers on his neck. It was in front of the cheerleaders. There were ambulances again. Crying girls and boys and even some of the teachers. Most of them just looked confused, except for Mr Straub. I managed to catch a glimpse of him as I jogged over to find out what all the screaming was about. He looked empty of all thoughts and emotions, with his head set at a crooked angle. I figured that was how people must look when dead, but apparently, he‚Äôd been like that during the act. He‚Äôd walked up, perched his neck between the slatted benches, and hit the remote button to slide the bleachers closed. Whole time, he was just slack-jawed and stupid looking, even as the metal mechanism crunched vertebrae and cartilage. I later learned Larry had been like this too, when he killed himself. He was getting ready to pop the tab on a fresh beer when he simply stopped, looked up to the sky, then forced the whole thing down his throat in a single world-shattering moment.

I didn‚Äôt know it back then, but there were others just like Larry and Mr Straub. A barista in a coffee shop steamed half the skin off her arm while keeping eye contact with a guy in the drive-thru. A doctor at the local clinic used a biopsy needle to inject air straight into his own heart. Lots of people shot themselves, but not one of them aimed for the head. That‚Äôs a weird touch, if you think about it. These people obliterated their torsos or limbs with high-powered rifles at point-blank range. No reason offered. Just a vacant expression as they deleted bits of their bodies and left nothing but ragged stumps.

There was no school the next day, which was the only real clue I got about how panicked the local authorities were. Wouldn‚Äôt be long before the national authorities joined in on the panic too, but that would come later. That morning, my parents left the house at 9:30 for a meeting at the town hall ,and they dropped me off at my Grandma‚Äôs on the way. I waited for them to leave before I told my grandma I was heading out. It was a hot day and she only nodded her approval as she sat reading with my sister. She hated seeing me play video games and always encouraged me to¬†*go make my own adventures outside*.¬†

I had no plans. Didn‚Äôt even want to see any of my friends. I thought a lot about Mr Straub‚Äôs face as I crossed empty farmers‚Äô fields and walked into the woods. I‚Äôd been to an open casket funeral once. It was for Father Dennis, who‚Äôd christened me as a baby, not that I remember anything about him except his stony face resting gently in the soft white folds of his casket‚Äôs interior. That seemed so long ago, and so sterile that the thought of it was a bit sad but not a whole lot else. But Mr Straub‚Äôs face had frightened me with his swollen lips and bulging eyes. Alive one moment and dead the next, with only pain to separate the two. And yet he‚Äôd looked so bored hanging there from his own broken neck, still wearing those ridiculous red shorts he always had on no matter the weather.

It took time to recognize that seeing a dead body had freaked me out. I felt like it shouldn‚Äôt have messed with me as much as it did, and I guess that‚Äôs why there was a little bit of anger mixed in with all those thoughts in my head. It‚Äôs also why I pushed on through the woods until the trees began to thin, marching in the humid summer heat until my t-shirt was soaked and my legs ached. I wanted to feel tired. Wanted it so the only thing I could think of were my throbbing hamstrings and sunburnt forehead.¬†

It ended when I reached the tracks. Shaggy rocks and boulders rose steeply on the opposite side. Only other ways to go were left into town or right into a dark tunnel, its mouth bristling with ivy. At least the air coming from it was cold, so I took a second to stand and catch my breath, feeling the sweat cool and evaporate as the wind billowed gently out of the darkness. I wasn‚Äôt stupid though. I paid close attention in case I heard the sound of any passing trains, and when I did hear one, I raced off the tracks as quick as I could.¬†

It honked as it came past. Another day and I might have worried that I was gonna get in trouble for playing on the rails, but all I could really think of was the thing I‚Äôd seen lying by the tracks. It‚Äôd been lit up by the train as it came roaring out of the tunnel, not far from the entrance. In the strange silence after the train had gone, there was only the dim light of the setting sun to see inside the tunnel, and everything looked the same. Old clothes. Broken bottles. Discarded crates. Trash strewn around wherever it found space. But I knew what I‚Äôd seen in the harsh white light of the train‚Äôs passing beams, and it was a hell of a lot more than garbage.

I‚Äôd seen a man.¬†

He was lying face down. There‚Äôd even been a hand, bright and pale like the moon in the night sky. I was sure of it. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, not right away. I was afraid and didn‚Äôt want to go inside, but I couldn‚Äôt just pretend I hadn‚Äôt seen anything either. I tried shouting to them. If someone down there heard me, they gave no sign of it. Wasn‚Äôt until I actually stepped into the darkness and let my eyes adjust that I confirmed there really was a man lying down in there.¬†

He was draped across the tracks, and he didn‚Äôt have any legs. And judging by the way the blood stains had turned the colour of shit, he‚Äôd been there for a while. Hell, half-a-dozen trains must‚Äôve gone right over him thinking he was just an old bit of cloth or something. That‚Äôs if they saw anything at all. In that time he‚Äôd dried out a little. He wasn‚Äôt a mummy or anything, but the blood on his stumps and coming out his mouth looked more like jelly than corn syrup. I was sobbing by this point. Crying hard as I tried to make sense of what I was meant to do, while also feeling like all of this was terribly unfair on me. There was a moment where I could almost feel myself wanting to be a kid again. A proper one. Little. One who doesn‚Äôt have to¬†*do*¬†things. One who can get upset and scream and run away. I‚Äôd only just started to appreciate how badly I‚Äôd been messed up by seeing Mr Straub, and then God went and dropped that kind of nightmare in my lap. Teeth stained black with blood and open eyes that looked at nothing. It¬†*felt*¬†like a nightmare. Not just the moment with the body, but everything else too. Everything since that beer beneath the tree had felt like it wasn‚Äôt part of reality anymore.

But nightmares end.

I was outside, gasping, vomiting, crying my eyes out, when I heard something shuffle in the tunnel I‚Äôd just run out of. Part of me thought that a sound must mean someone was alive and close by and that meant I wasn‚Äôt alone. But another part of me thought something else entirely. It was the part of me that took over and stopped me crying or making any more noise. My mouth turned dry as a desert and all of a sudden I was no longer hot all over, but cold. Freezing cold. And my legs were backpedalling away from the tunnel with short, quiet, steps.¬†

The noise persisted. It was the shuffle of something getting dragged over gravel and old plastic bags. It had a rhythm to it that was slow. The word that springs to mind is one I got taught in a biology class a long time ago.¬†

*Locomotion.*¬†

Something down there was moving. It was moving¬†*towards*¬†me. It sounded slow and broken and feeble but that didn‚Äôt matter. Somehow, even though I knew it was completely insane, I just knew what was gonna come out of that tunnel. I knew it the way the rabbit knows the wolf, or the ant knows the spider.¬†

But still, when I saw him crawl out of the dark and into the light, I screamed so loud I‚Äôd have a sore throat for the next few days. It was the man from the tracks and even though he moved, he was not alive. I tried telling myself that he couldn‚Äôt have been dead because only living things move, but that was horseshit. He‚Äôd dragged his bloody legless torso with one working arm while the other lay dislocated across his back, the fingers of both hands curling as he heaved himself along. And that face. That same empty gawking expression, just like Mr Straub‚Äôs. He wasn‚Äôt alive. He was a dead¬†*thing*¬†and that made him some kind of impossible monster.

I turned and ran screaming through the trees. Whole time, I could only think of the thing that was behind me and was trying to close the distance. It didn‚Äôt matter that it was slow. Didn‚Äôt matter that I ran for over an hour. Didn‚Äôt even matter that I wasn‚Äôt sure if I knew my way home or was even running in the right direction. All that mattered was putting one foot in front of the other until there was nothing left inside me. Time turned funny. Seconds moved in strange staccatos until eventually I collapsed on legs made of rubber. Then I dragged myself into an old tree hollow to hide and that was where I lost all consciousness.¬†

\-

When I woke up, the sun had set and it was dark.¬†

I vomited some, then found my way back to the beaten path and stumbled achingly through the cold night air back to my Grandma‚Äôs farmhouse.

Dad was sick.¬†

My Grandma screamed something to this effect at me as she held down his right arm, while my mother tried to grip his head in her blood-slick hands. He resisted with dumb determination. My little sister cried, watching the scene like a shellshocked soldier. There was grunting and sobbing and suddenly, a bang. Then a puff of plaster rained down onto my head and everyone began to yell and shriek a little louder.¬†

Dad had a gun. That was what my Grandma was trying to wrestle out of his hands. She held a knife and that‚Äôs why there was blood, but I didn‚Äôt know whose it was. I wasn‚Äôt sure what she was planning to do with it until she tried to use it to cut his trigger finger off. The scuffle resulted in another bang and a window exploded outwards. I finally ducked and grabbed my sister, rushing her into another room, but there were three more explosions and each one broke something inside me. By the time I heard my name being called, I was half-deaf and twitching at things that weren‚Äôt there. My sister pleaded for me to come back, her pink fingers grasping for me as I put her down. But my mother was shouting for me to come help, and I wanted to keep my family safe.¬†

She told me to get something to tie Dad up while she and my Grandma used both arms to pin each of his wrists to the ground. His hand bled weakly as my Grandma used every inch of her strength to simultaneously pin him and stop the flow. He thrashed slowly beneath them, his movements languid and easy, but I could tell it was a struggle for them to keep him down. As I ran to the garage I saw the gun on the ground with Dad‚Äôs severed finger nearby. I kicked it out of reach before returning shortly with the rope my Grandma used to tie the garage door open during hot summers.¬†

Mom tied the knots. My Grandma tried talking to my Dad and it was one of the few times in my life I saw her as the woman who‚Äôd once changed his diapers. She was so soothing and tender and her constant muttering that everything would be okay. Seemed so fragile. She was scared for him. Mom just did everything in her power to wrestle some safety out of the moment. Only once his arms were securely behind his back and she was confident he wasn‚Äôt breaking free did she stand back, put her hands behind her, and then immediately hunch forward and sob.¬†

‚ÄúCall an ambulance,‚Äù my Grandma told me as she walked into the other room to get my sister. Before I got the phone, I briefly hugged my Mom who didn‚Äôt seem to notice. I risked a glance at my Dad who didn‚Äôt look at anything at all. Dead eyes gazed vacantly at nothing as he fought to free his arms.¬†

When he finally looked at me, it was no different to how he looked at the floor or the wall.

\-

I didn‚Äôt go to school the next day either. Some men from the government came to take Dad in the morning, and Mom ordered me to my room when they arrived. She asked them a thousand questions, but their replies were short and stern. All I managed to overhear were a few muffled phrases.¬†*Please stay put Ma‚Äôam. Someone will be in contact with you shortly.*¬†When I ran to my window to look at them walking down the drive I saw that they all wore masks. One of them saw me staring. I thought he was going to wave, but he didn‚Äôt.¬†

There was a biohazard symbol on their clothes.¬†

After they left, Mom focused on making dinner and looking after my sister. She kept me close the whole time, barking anxious questions whenever I tried to leave the room.¬†

*Where are you going!?*

*Just the bathroom.*¬†

*Oh. Okay then.*¬†

It felt like she was painting normality onto tissue paper, desperately afraid of breaking it. I tried my best to seem like I was okay. Last thing I wanted was to feel like some kid who needed his mommy. We mostly just talked about mundane things but it was hard for both of us. The only time the atmosphere seemed to change was when she asked me something strange half-way through dinner.¬†

‚ÄúDid your father‚Ä¶ when you both went hunting a few months back, what did you do with the meat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúDad took care of all that. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe men who took him asked a whole bunch of questions about it.‚Äù Then, with a fragile smile, ‚Äúhave you done your homework? They told me your teacher would send you some assignments online‚Ä¶‚Äù

Just like that, the thin pretense of normality came back. ButI was left with a wriggling feeling in my stomach. It didn‚Äôt go away as the evening marched on. In fact, it only grew worse until I found myself in bed rolling from side to side and thinking about Mom‚Äôs question. The men who‚Äôd bundled Dad off hadn‚Äôt seemed like the kind who messed around. They must have had some idea what was going on, so why ask about meat?

On some level, I knew the moment she‚Äôd asked me why it was relevant. Dad loved to hunt and he always brought meat to parties and barbecues. Wasn‚Äôt it obvious? He‚Äôd brought something back from the woods, hadn‚Äôt he? I hadn‚Äôt gone hunting for a long time. Nearly three months. Every time he‚Äôd asked I‚Äôd refused and I think he knew why.¬†

On the very last trip, Dad shot three deer but we only brought back two. One for us. One for the town barbecue. The third he shot but we left it on the forest floor because by the time it had died I was pale and shaking and even Dad couldn‚Äôt keep the tremor out of his voice. Neither of us had expected the deer to stand up on its hind legs and walk towards us like a man, its gait a heavy and broken thing as it lumbered over the forest floor.¬†

And it had kept coming even after Dad shot it six more times. One of the rounds struck it in the head, but still it shambled forward on two misshapen legs as its brains painted the ferns a pestilent grey. When it finally fell, even Dad had gone pale and in the silent aftermath I had to go off and be sick in a bush. After that we cut the trip short. Dad walked me gently back to the truck where the two deer we‚Äôd shot and trussed earlier that day lay waiting in the pickup. I don‚Äôt think either of us even remembered they were there until later.¬†

He‚Äôd still ask if I wanted to head out with him each weekend, but he never seemed surprised when I made some excuse. The only time we talked about it was not long before the barbecue when he drove me to school one day. He didn‚Äôt deal with it head on. He skirted the topic.¬†

*Sometimes deer get sick,*¬†he‚Äôd told me.¬†*A little like old folks do. Remember Grampa? He got real scary towards the end, didn‚Äôt he? Well deer get sick too. But we don‚Äôt have to worry. Same way you couldn‚Äôt catch what Grampa had, well we can‚Äôt catch what the deer have. Us humans are safe. Just‚Ä¶ just an uncomfortable part of nature.*

It had come outta the blue, or at least it‚Äôd seemed like it. I figured it was Dad‚Äôs way of trying to get me back onboard with hunting. I knew he liked me going with him. I‚Äôd liked it too, at least until I‚Äôd seen that deer walk towards me on two legs. But lying in my bed that night after Mom had gone to sleep, I started to wonder if maybe he hadn‚Äôt really been trying to convince me. Maybe he carried a little doubt in himself about something he was gonna do.¬†

What if he‚Äôd been trying to convince himself it was okay?

Two deer. I tried remembering what they‚Äôd been like. I hadn‚Äôt checked them after we got in the truck. Why would I? Seemed as normal as any others as we tied them down, but I hadn‚Äôt really been paying attention either. I‚Äôd been hunting since I was seven. Helping Dad was automatic to me. And to top it off, I hadn‚Äôt known what I was meant to be looking for.¬†

I squirmed beneath the sheets and tried so hard to remember every detail of that trip. Most of all I tried to remember what the first two deer Dad had shot were like. They‚Äôd gone down so quick, they‚Äôd seemed normal. But Grampa had been sick with Alzheimer‚Äôs a long time before he got scary, and I had to figure the same could be true of those deer. Who was to say the one on hind legs was the only sick creature in the woods that day?

I couldn‚Äôt have forced these thoughts out of my head with a crowbar. At some point I accepted I wasn‚Äôt getting any sleep that night and I settled down to torture myself some more until I realised it didn‚Äôt have to be that way. Dad had an old freezer in the shed and he sometimes kept meat in there. Not for long, and usually not for eating. He‚Äôd use it for things he wanted to skin or try and make a trophy out of tt, which he rarely did since Mom didn‚Äôt like that kind of thing in the house. But if the deer weren‚Äôt in the freezer in the kitchen or the garage, then they might be in the shed. And if I did open up that chest and saw two deer bodies in there, that meant whatever was going around and making people hurt themselves couldn‚Äôt have come from our little hunting trip.

I snuck out my room as quietly as I could. Mom was on the phone with my Grandma and she was crying. I stopped briefly by her door and listened to see if maybe they knew something I didn‚Äôt, but after she started talking about how scared she was I just felt bad and moved on. At least it meant she was too busy to notice me creeping down the stairs.

I never liked the shed at the end of the yard. It was rarely used, even by my Dad who kept the lawn mower and some old junk in there. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of place you kept food but I had this feeling he didn‚Äôt keep these deer with the rest of the meat he got from hunting. As I opened the backdoor and looked over the shadow-covered yard I found myself thinking about the tunnel and what I‚Äôd seen back there. With everything that had happened since, I‚Äôd done a good job of convincing myself it‚Äôd never really happened. The man with no legs who dragged himself out of the darkness had become little more than a half-remembered nightmare. A moment out of time that was incompatible with all logic and reason. But suddenly it was back with me. All the emotions and thoughts that raced through my head as I‚Äôd stared at his rotten flesh and glassy eyes.¬†

The walk to the shed wasn‚Äôt easy. I fought the urge to turn around the entire way there. Each step was like walking on feet made of lead. At the door, I paused with my hand poised by the lock. The house seemed so distant behind me, and I became painfully aware nobody knew I was alone and out in the dark.¬†

Inside was nearly pitch black. My phone helped me light it up a little, but I didn‚Äôt touch the nearby switch in case Mom saw it from her window. Cobwebs hung low from the ceiling, and shadows crawled across the floor and walls as I moved closer to the freezer. The entire time I kept expecting something to happen. I even imagined that deer rising from beneath the lid, pushing it open to stand unnaturally tall on its hind legs where it looked down at me with the same dead eyes I‚Äôd seen in my father. The thought scared me so bad I nearly hyperventilated myself straight into a panic attack, but before I had time to really worry about any of that I found my hand on the freezer latch.¬†

I pushed it open and looked inside. The misty vapours cleared to reveal a pile of meat and fur encrusted with ice. There was only one head visible, but I so badly wanted confirmation that there were two animals in there that I took a deep breath and reached in to try and pry some of it loose. Some of it came away from the sides with a sound like duct tape, but no matter how deep I rooted around in that mound of bone, antlers, and rock-hard flesh, I couldn‚Äôt see a sign of the second deer.¬†

Had Dad really served everyone sick meat? Was that really why Larry Sitkins, Mr Straub, and all those other people had killed themselves?

The thought made me feel ill. I slammed the freezer shut and walked back to the door in a daze, trying with all my might to swallow the painful weight that settled in my gut.¬†

I had one foot outside when the freezer door rattled against the latch.

The entire world spun around me. My heart sank and my skin froze in a sensation that was growing increasingly familiar. I turned to face the sound, both hands braced against the door, and watched as the hatch slammed into the lock once more. The light inside the chest came on for the briefest of moments and I glimpsed thrashing fur and teeth. Then it happened again, and again, and each time I saw bits of hoof and bone and strange musculature that frightened me so deeply I fell down onto my ass and didn‚Äôt even realise.¬†

When the latch finally gave way, the lid flew open and stayed there. Light poured out of the box and I waited, breath held, for that thing to emerge. To come roaring out of sight and bear down towards me on unnatural legs. But nothing happened. The silence stretched on for what seemed like an eternity until, at last, there was a crash louder than any before and the entire freezer rocked back and forth and slowly fell over.¬†

The deer, or parts of it, fell out with a hard, wet,¬†*thump*. Bits of its chin and face shattered on the hard packed ground, sending little shards of meat and bone skating across the floor on melting streaks of blood. Some of them even reached my feet.¬†

The thing inside moved with the sound of snow crunching beneath your feet. Its thick neck and broken head twisting side to side, scanning the shed‚Äôs interior with faulty eyes. I‚Äôve never seen anything move like that. Not before or since. This was worse than the man in the tunnel. Worse by a thousand times. The deer was still mostly frozen but some impossible force was making fight the crystallised water in its own cells and the result was skin that ripped like tissue and muscles that cracked and crunched as they tried to flex and contract.¬†

It lifted its head and tried to scream. The breathy sound that left its fuzzy black lips made my heart start skipping beats while my bladder emptied. I couldn‚Äôt help it. Couldn‚Äôt stop myself. And when I looked down and saw pieces of melting flesh start to writhe and wriggle, I tried with all my might to stifle the cry building up in my throat, but it still escaped as a desperate, high pitched whine.¬†

The deer turned its head towards me with a violent swing. Another breathy shriek and then it began to thrash its stiff and frozen legs in a terrifying attempt to get closer. To say it had a predatory look would be inaccurate. Anyone who‚Äôs seen a predator in action knows that nature is mostly indifferent when it kills. A bear tears into its prey with the same dull look of someone opening their McDonalds. Predators don‚Äôt hate the things they hunt. But this¬†*thing*. I could feel its hatred. Its malice. It was nothing like what I‚Äôd seen in my Dad‚Äôs eyes or even the eyes of the man in the tunnel.¬†

But it had spent months in that box, hadn‚Äôt it? This was the disease when you skipped three months ahead. Anger. Hatred. Jesus Christ, I couldn‚Äôt even say if it was gonna eat me. That‚Äôs what you think when you see a zombie, right? It‚Äôs gonna try and take a big bite outta you. But this frozen clump of hair and meat and braying lips dragged itself across the floor with an expression like murderous rage. The look of someone ready to beat another living thing to death using its own hands if it had to.

Unable to face it a moment longer, I dragged myself back onto my feet and fled, shutting my eyes as I entered the cold night air.¬†

I made it three steps before I slammed into my Dad.

\-

It was like I‚Äôd run full speed into a tree. I bounced back and hit the earth, pain flaring up my coccyx as my father loomed over me. He‚Äôd felt cold for the brief moment where we‚Äôd made contact. My mind blocked out the sound of something hideous scrambling in the shed behind me, and the entire world narrowed until it was just the face of the man who‚Äôd raised me, looking down with pale dead eyes.¬†

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

He swallowed, then briefly examined his hands.¬†

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm dead,‚Äù he muttered, almost as if he was talking to himself. ‚ÄúWhen did I die?‚Äù

I pulled myself up and grabbed his hand. He was cold, but his pulse was racing. I could even see the veins in his forearms throb sickeningly.¬†

‚ÄúDad? Are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey told me I‚Äôm sick,‚Äù he said, his eyes gazing vacantly at the empty space behind me. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre right. But there‚Äôs more.‚Äù

He looked at me, the intensity of his gaze so powerful that I let go of his hand and took a step back. For the first time in my life, I was scared of him.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone in here,‚Äù he said, his voice pleading for help. Slowly, his expression twisted into a grotesque mask of agony and desperation.¬† ‚ÄúOh Jesus! It isn‚Äôt just me in here!‚Äù

I tried to move but he was a big man, and his arms wrapped around me like steel bands.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I cried, struggling to pull myself loose as he sobbed louder and louder. ‚ÄúDad! Jesus! You gotta let me go there‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù

The shed door burst open. I managed to twist around just enough I could see what came out, and I felt an urgent terror crawling up my flesh. The deer had pulled itself loose from the freezer, and it now stood in the doorway on two legs. Its body looked all wrong in that posture, like when you twist the limbs around on a doll. Probably not far from the truth, thinking about it.¬†

Dad didn‚Äôt react, but I began to scream as the nightmare coalesced around me. My father gripping, holding me in place as that horrible thing lurched towards me on two legs. It moved like claymation or a puppet show gone wrong, but it was quicker than I‚Äôd feared. As each strep brought it closer, I found myself losing what little control I had. I started to scream. Started to¬†*shriek*. I beat at my father with my fists, but he didn‚Äôt budge an inch. My clenched hands just bounced off his strong shoulders, and it was like I was trying to hurt a punching bag. I started to swear too. Started to scream things I thought were bad, then worse, then so bad I‚Äôm not even sure I can blame other people for putting those words in my head. I told my Dad I hated him. Called him a son of a bitch. Called him even worse.¬†

All that commotion got the attention of others. Neighbors‚Äô lights started coming on. My mom emerged from the backdoor, wrapping her robe around herself as she squinted at us in the dark.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on!?‚Äù she cried as she stumbled towards us, but when she saw that deer, she started screaming too.¬†

I don‚Äôt know why but I thought that other people appearing would help somehow. That as two, three, half-a-dozen people came stumbling into the open lawns, peering over waist-high fences, it‚Äôd stop the slow but inevitable onslaught of that monster. It did no such thing. I had to listen to their confused shouts and cries while gesturing and begging for help, the entire time the sound of the creature over my shoulder getting closer and closer. Meanwhile, my hands tried to pry away my father‚Äôs thick arms but each time I got leverage he simply flexed and his grip tightened around me. He was muttering something the whole time, but I couldn‚Äôt hear it.¬†

Finally, my Mom screamed and ran swinging an old rake at the space behind me. I heard the impact. The splintering of the wooden handle. Then she stumbled backwards and I had to twist to get a look at the deer that was now just six or seven feet away, the spokes of a rake still sticking out of its face.¬†

The monster looked right at me and opened its mouth and I swear to fucking God it was gonna talk, but right then someone shouted,¬†

‚ÄúFor the love of God Alice, get away from that thing!‚Äù

Alice was my mother‚Äôs name, and she fell to the floor just seconds before an explosion broke the night, silencing all voices and shattering the deer‚Äôs head like a crystal ball hitting the ground.¬†

My heart raced so fast I thought for a moment I was gonna die. Then I looked down at Dad and finally heard what he‚Äôd been mumbling this whole time.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in us and it wants us. It‚Äôs in us and it wants us. It‚Äôs in us and it wants us‚Ä¶‚Äù

\-

There isn‚Äôt much left of Dad these days. I got to visit a couple times. Fat lot of good it did. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, he died that day in the kitchen when he first tried shooting himself.¬†

They‚Äôre treating us in this special hospital. Mom was real upset that visitations are limited but‚Ä¶ I think it might be for the best. Her and my sister tested clean. Most people did.¬†

I didn‚Äôt.

Mom snuck me this phone a couple weeks ago and I been using that to write. Funny thing is one of the orderlies saw me on it a few days ago and just laughed. I think that maybe the government aren‚Äôt too worried about this story getting out. At first I didn‚Äôt really get why until I started actually putting all this down into writing. Got to the part where that half-man came out the tunnel and I realised no one‚Äôs gonna believe me.

Still, I gotta try. Partly cause I wanna protect people. Whatever this disease is, it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more than some twisted prions and I think the government knows that. Dad certainly did. Most infected did too. That‚Äôs why they killed themselves. They wanted out. The voice that comes with this illness is like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like if your brain is just words in a book and then someone dipped that book in a can full of used motor oil. You just wanna give in. Hand it all over. It wants your body so whatever you do, don‚Äôt fight. That‚Äôs worse. Give it up.¬†

In hindsight, we should‚Äôve let Dad kill himself. What he went through was‚Ä¶ well it was probably a lot worse than the others who got to die.

I sometimes think about going into his room with a pillow, but security is pretty tight around him.¬†

As for me, infection is still in its early phase. It takes everyone differently, and for me it‚Äôs taking quite its time. They think it‚Äôs because of my age. Still, I can sorta feel it under there. Growing.¬†

I think it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.¬†

It wants me to.¬†

This sickness, it lives out in the woods. Way way out, in parts of the soil where the sun hasn‚Äôt shone in millions of years. It‚Äôs old enough to remember a time you could walk from Appalachia to what‚Äôs now called Glasgow. And it‚Äôs been fumbling around out there, in the brains of deer and other things.¬†

The sickness tells me this. Tells me it‚Äôs learning about this new world. Tells me how my mind tastes.

But most of all‚Ä¶¬†

It tells me it‚Äôs getting closer.",17,1753461890.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Not sure if this is a me problem or if others here can relate, but I‚Äôve reached a point in my espresso journey where I genuinely can‚Äôt enjoy a shot unless every single variable is tuned with near-laboratory precision. I‚Äôm talking about espresso that only tastes good if I‚Äôve:

	‚Ä¢	Weighed my beans to the hundredth of a gram (18.20g exactly)

	‚Ä¢	Measured yield during extraction, not after‚Äî36.0g ¬± 0.3g

	‚Ä¢	Used a WDT tool with 0.3mm acupuncture needles in a 3D-printed pattern I custom-modeled for even density distribution

	‚Ä¢	Tapped the portafilter exactly three times on a silicone mat to settle the bed

	‚Ä¢	Calibrated tamp pressure to 30lbs using a force-sensing tamper (and I check it quarterly with a digital scale)

	‚Ä¢	Preheated my bottomless portafilter for 90 seconds in the grouphead (flush once at 5s, again at 45s, and a final time right before locking in)

	‚Ä¢	Monitored room temperature and barometric pressure because I swear it affects flow rate

	‚Ä¢	Used water I remineralized myself with sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate to mimic Rao/Perger water, mixed in a vacuum-sealed vessel to avoid CO‚ÇÇ exposure

	‚Ä¢	Verified the grind consistency using a Kruve sifter (I aim for 200‚Äì400 micron range with <15% fines)

	‚Ä¢	Pulled the shot on my Linea Mini with a 3-second pre-infusion at 2 bar, ramped to 9 bar over 4 seconds, then declined to 6 bar post-blonding

	‚Ä¢	Timed total shot duration to 29.7s‚Äîanything faster and it tastes hollow, anything slower and the florals vanish

	‚Ä¢	Logged the shot in my extraction spreadsheet (which has data from every shot I‚Äôve pulled since February 2023‚Äîcurrently 812 entries)

And I haven‚Äôt even started on the beans. If they‚Äôre not roasted between 6‚Äì9 days ago, vacuum-sealed in a nitrogen-flushed bag, and opened exactly 20 minutes before the first shot, I don‚Äôt even bother. I also use a rotating air drum de-gassing chamber (DIY build) to control CO‚ÇÇ levels before I grind.

Here‚Äôs the problem: when I don‚Äôt go through all of this, the espresso tastes flat, muddled, or just ‚Äúoff.‚Äù Not terrible, but not even close to what I know it could be. I‚Äôve tried relaxing, but when I drink a shot from someone‚Äôs Breville Express with pre-ground Lavazza and a pressurized basket, I physically can‚Äôt get through it. I honestly feel bad, but I just taste every flaw.

I‚Äôve also noticed that even micro-changes‚Äîlike a 0.1g dose variation or forgetting to swirl the demitasse before sipping‚Äîcompletely throw off the shot. Is this normal? Or have I completely ruined myself?

Would love to hear from others who‚Äôve gone way too deep and now struggle to enjoy 95% of espresso out there. Or maybe someone who found a way to pull back and just enjoy the process again without needing to reverse-engineer every variable?

1m943jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ChristianWallis/comments/1m943jt/my_dad_ate_meat_from_a_deer_that_walked_on_two/,My Dad ate meat from a deer that walked on two legs. Now he‚Äôs acting kinda strange.,"The party was two weeks ago. I stole a few beers when the adults weren‚Äôt looking and shared them with Lucy Sitkins away from the crowd. She drank hers greedily as we sat beneath the bough of a low tree, speaking low so no passers-by could hear. Every time we whispered, we tilted our faces a little closer and closer. There was a moment where I thought she was going to rest her head on my shoulder as she told me about how she wanted to be a vet, and my heart skipped as I debated putting my arm around her waist.¬†

It was all cut short when her father, Larry, stood in front of everyone in the party and forced a beer can down his throat. I didn‚Äôt see it. I only heard the cries that had us both sitting upright beneath the branches. By the time we got back to the party the adults were escorting the kids away and ambulance sirens were fast approaching. Dad was there and he told me to take my little sister home. The grim and frightening look on his face made me forget Lucy and the smell of beer on her breath. I try hard to remember if she ate from the barbecue. Sometimes I think she didn‚Äôt, other times I swear I can picture her biting into a burger and it‚Äôs so vivid I think it must be a memory. It‚Äôs moot either way. I‚Äôll never see her again.¬†

I felt a little gross when I went into school the next day and asked around if the stories about her dad were true. When my father got home the night of the party, he hadn‚Äôt spoken to me or Mom. He just went to bed and didn‚Äôt tell us what happened. Come morning, I saw some of the older kids by the school gates and overheard them talking. The details made my stomach churn, but I wanted to know more. I didn‚Äôt want to act all excited about something terrible, but this felt like the kind of thing people would be talking about for years.¬†

Larry Sitkins had swallowed a beer can.¬†

*‚ÄúShoved it down his throat like a fucking boa constrictor eating an egg!‚Äù*¬†

At least that‚Äôs how one kid described it to me. There was more, of course. He‚Äôd praised Satan before slitting his own throat. Gotten piss drunk and fallen hard onto the ground while chugging a beer. Tried to catch the can mid-air. Someone had punched him mid-sip. There were a lot of variations on what happened and how, but they were only theories that got turned into rumours. A lot of us were just trying to make sense of it. Larry was a pretty run-of-the-mill guy. He was a landscaper who made lame jokes at kids‚Äô birthday parties. He was about as non-descript as they came, at least as far as a bunch of teenagers were concerned.¬†

We got halfway through the day before Mr Straub shut the bleachers on his neck. It was in front of the cheerleaders. There were ambulances again. Crying girls and boys and even some of the teachers. Most of them just looked confused, except for Mr Straub. I managed to catch a glimpse of him as I jogged over to find out what all the screaming was about. He looked empty of all thoughts and emotions, with his head set at a crooked angle. I figured that was how people must look when dead, but apparently, he‚Äôd been like that during the act. He‚Äôd walked up, perched his neck between the slatted benches, and hit the remote button to slide the bleachers closed. Whole time, he was just slack-jawed and stupid looking, even as the metal mechanism crunched vertebrae and cartilage. I later learned Larry had been like this too, when he killed himself. He was getting ready to pop the tab on a fresh beer when he simply stopped, looked up to the sky, then forced the whole thing down his throat in a single world-shattering moment.

I didn‚Äôt know it back then, but there were others just like Larry and Mr Straub. A barista in a coffee shop steamed half the skin off her arm while keeping eye contact with a guy in the drive-thru. A doctor at the local clinic used a biopsy needle to inject air straight into his own heart. Lots of people shot themselves, but not one of them aimed for the head. That‚Äôs a weird touch, if you think about it. These people obliterated their torsos or limbs with high-powered rifles at point-blank range. No reason offered. Just a vacant expression as they deleted bits of their bodies and left nothing but ragged stumps.

There was no school the next day, which was the only real clue I got about how panicked the local authorities were. Wouldn‚Äôt be long before the national authorities joined in on the panic too, but that would come later. That morning, my parents left the house at 9:30 for a meeting at the town hall ,and they dropped me off at my Grandma‚Äôs on the way. I waited for them to leave before I told my grandma I was heading out. It was a hot day and she only nodded her approval as she sat reading with my sister. She hated seeing me play video games and always encouraged me to *go make my own adventures outside*.¬†

I had no plans. Didn‚Äôt even want to see any of my friends. I thought a lot about Mr Straub‚Äôs face as I crossed empty farmers‚Äô fields and walked into the woods. I‚Äôd been to an open casket funeral once. It was for Father Dennis, who‚Äôd christened me as a baby, not that I remember anything about him except his stony face resting gently in the soft white folds of his casket‚Äôs interior. That seemed so long ago, and so sterile that the thought of it was a bit sad but not a whole lot else. But Mr Straub‚Äôs face had frightened me with his swollen lips and bulging eyes. Alive one moment and dead the next, with only pain to separate the two. And yet he‚Äôd looked so bored hanging there from his own broken neck, still wearing those ridiculous red shorts he always had on no matter the weather.

It took time to recognize that seeing a dead body had freaked me out. I felt like it shouldn‚Äôt have messed with me as much as it did, and I guess that‚Äôs why there was a little bit of anger mixed in with all those thoughts in my head. It‚Äôs also why I pushed on through the woods until the trees began to thin, marching in the humid summer heat until my t-shirt was soaked and my legs ached. I wanted to feel tired. Wanted it so the only thing I could think of were my throbbing hamstrings and sunburnt forehead.¬†

It ended when I reached the tracks. Shaggy rocks and boulders rose steeply on the opposite side. Only other ways to go were left into town or right into a dark tunnel, its mouth bristling with ivy. At least the air coming from it was cold, so I took a second to stand and catch my breath, feeling the sweat cool and evaporate as the wind billowed gently out of the darkness. I wasn‚Äôt stupid though. I paid close attention in case I heard the sound of any passing trains, and when I did hear one, I raced off the tracks as quick as I could.¬†

It honked as it came past. Another day and I might have worried that I was gonna get in trouble for playing on the rails, but all I could really think of was the thing I‚Äôd seen lying by the tracks. It‚Äôd been lit up by the train as it came roaring out of the tunnel, not far from the entrance. In the strange silence after the train had gone, there was only the dim light of the setting sun to see inside the tunnel, and everything looked the same. Old clothes. Broken bottles. Discarded crates. Trash strewn around wherever it found space. But I knew what I‚Äôd seen in the harsh white light of the train‚Äôs passing beams, and it was a hell of a lot more than garbage.

I‚Äôd seen a man.¬†

He was lying face down. There‚Äôd even been a hand, bright and pale like the moon in the night sky. I was sure of it. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, not right away. I was afraid and didn‚Äôt want to go inside, but I couldn‚Äôt just pretend I hadn‚Äôt seen anything either. I tried shouting to them. If someone down there heard me, they gave no sign of it. Wasn‚Äôt until I actually stepped into the darkness and let my eyes adjust that I confirmed there really was a man lying down in there.¬†

He was draped across the tracks, and he didn‚Äôt have any legs. And judging by the way the blood stains had turned the colour of shit, he‚Äôd been there for a while. Hell, half-a-dozen trains must‚Äôve gone right over him thinking he was just an old bit of cloth or something. That‚Äôs if they saw anything at all. In that time he‚Äôd dried out a little. He wasn‚Äôt a mummy or anything, but the blood on his stumps and coming out his mouth looked more like jelly than corn syrup. I was sobbing by this point. Crying hard as I tried to make sense of what I was meant to do, while also feeling like all of this was terribly unfair on me. There was a moment where I could almost feel myself wanting to be a kid again. A proper one. Little. One who doesn‚Äôt have to *do* things. One who can get upset and scream and run away. I‚Äôd only just started to appreciate how badly I‚Äôd been messed up by seeing Mr Straub, and then God went and dropped that kind of nightmare in my lap. Teeth stained black with blood and open eyes that looked at nothing. It *felt* like a nightmare. Not just the moment with the body, but everything else too. Everything since that beer beneath the tree had felt like it wasn‚Äôt part of reality anymore.

But nightmares end.

I was outside, gasping, vomiting, crying my eyes out, when I heard something shuffle in the tunnel I‚Äôd just run out of. Part of me thought that a sound must mean someone was alive and close by and that meant I wasn‚Äôt alone. But another part of me thought something else entirely. It was the part of me that took over and stopped me crying or making any more noise. My mouth turned dry as a desert and all of a sudden I was no longer hot all over, but cold. Freezing cold. And my legs were backpedalling away from the tunnel with short, quiet, steps.¬†

The noise persisted. It was the shuffle of something getting dragged over gravel and old plastic bags. It had a rhythm to it that was slow. The word that springs to mind is one I got taught in a biology class a long time ago.¬†

*Locomotion.*¬†

Something down there was moving. It was moving *towards* me. It sounded slow and broken and feeble but that didn‚Äôt matter. Somehow, even though I knew it was completely insane, I just knew what was gonna come out of that tunnel. I knew it the way the rabbit knows the wolf, or the ant knows the spider.¬†

But still, when I saw him crawl out of the dark and into the light, I screamed so loud I‚Äôd have a sore throat for the next few days. It was the man from the tracks and even though he moved, he was not alive. I tried telling myself that he couldn‚Äôt have been dead because only living things move, but that was horseshit. He‚Äôd dragged his bloody legless torso with one working arm while the other lay dislocated across his back, the fingers of both hands curling as he heaved himself along. And that face. That same empty gawking expression, just like Mr Straub‚Äôs. He wasn‚Äôt alive. He was a dead *thing* and that made him some kind of impossible monster.

I turned and ran screaming through the trees. Whole time, I could only think of the thing that was behind me and was trying to close the distance. It didn‚Äôt matter that it was slow. Didn‚Äôt matter that I ran for over an hour. Didn‚Äôt even matter that I wasn‚Äôt sure if I knew my way home or was even running in the right direction. All that mattered was putting one foot in front of the other until there was nothing left inside me. Time turned funny. Seconds moved in strange staccatos until eventually I collapsed on legs made of rubber. Then I dragged myself into an old tree hollow to hide and that was where I lost all consciousness.¬†

\-

When I woke up, the sun had set and it was dark.¬†

I vomited some, then found my way back to the beaten path and stumbled achingly through the cold night air back to my Grandma‚Äôs farmhouse.

Dad was sick.¬†

My Grandma screamed something to this effect at me as she held down his right arm, while my mother tried to grip his head in her blood-slick hands. He resisted with dumb determination. My little sister cried, watching the scene like a shellshocked soldier. There was grunting and sobbing and suddenly, a bang. Then a puff of plaster rained down onto my head and everyone began to yell and shriek a little louder.¬†

Dad had a gun. That was what my Grandma was trying to wrestle out of his hands. She held a knife and that‚Äôs why there was blood, but I didn‚Äôt know whose it was. I wasn‚Äôt sure what she was planning to do with it until she tried to use it to cut his trigger finger off. The scuffle resulted in another bang and a window exploded outwards. I finally ducked and grabbed my sister, rushing her into another room, but there were three more explosions and each one broke something inside me. By the time I heard my name being called, I was half-deaf and twitching at things that weren‚Äôt there. My sister pleaded for me to come back, her pink fingers grasping for me as I put her down. But my mother was shouting for me to come help, and I wanted to keep my family safe.¬†

She told me to get something to tie Dad up while she and my Grandma used both arms to pin each of his wrists to the ground. His hand bled weakly as my Grandma used every inch of her strength to simultaneously pin him and stop the flow. He thrashed slowly beneath them, his movements languid and easy, but I could tell it was a struggle for them to keep him down. As I ran to the garage I saw the gun on the ground with Dad‚Äôs severed finger nearby. I kicked it out of reach before returning shortly with the rope my Grandma used to tie the garage door open during hot summers.¬†

Mom tied the knots. My Grandma tried talking to my Dad and it was one of the few times in my life I saw her as the woman who‚Äôd once changed his diapers. She was so soothing and tender and her constant muttering that everything would be okay. Seemed so fragile. She was scared for him. Mom just did everything in her power to wrestle some safety out of the moment. Only once his arms were securely behind his back and she was confident he wasn‚Äôt breaking free did she stand back, put her hands behind her, and then immediately hunch forward and sob.¬†

‚ÄúCall an ambulance,‚Äù my Grandma told me as she walked into the other room to get my sister. Before I got the phone, I briefly hugged my Mom who didn‚Äôt seem to notice. I risked a glance at my Dad who didn‚Äôt look at anything at all. Dead eyes gazed vacantly at nothing as he fought to free his arms.¬†

When he finally looked at me, it was no different to how he looked at the floor or the wall.

\-

I didn‚Äôt go to school the next day either. Some men from the government came to take Dad in the morning, and Mom ordered me to my room when they arrived. She asked them a thousand questions, but their replies were short and stern. All I managed to overhear were a few muffled phrases. *Please stay put Ma‚Äôam. Someone will be in contact with you shortly.* When I ran to my window to look at them walking down the drive I saw that they all wore masks. One of them saw me staring. I thought he was going to wave, but he didn‚Äôt.¬†

There was a biohazard symbol on their clothes.¬†

After they left, Mom focused on making dinner and looking after my sister. She kept me close the whole time, barking anxious questions whenever I tried to leave the room.¬†

*Where are you going!?*

*Just the bathroom.*¬†

*Oh. Okay then.*¬†

It felt like she was painting normality onto tissue paper, desperately afraid of breaking it. I tried my best to seem like I was okay. Last thing I wanted was to feel like some kid who needed his mommy. We mostly just talked about mundane things but it was hard for both of us. The only time the atmosphere seemed to change was when she asked me something strange half-way through dinner.¬†

‚ÄúDid your father‚Ä¶ when you both went hunting a few months back, what did you do with the meat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúDad took care of all that. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe men who took him asked a whole bunch of questions about it.‚Äù Then, with a fragile smile, ‚Äúhave you done your homework? They told me your teacher would send you some assignments online‚Ä¶‚Äù

Just like that, the thin pretense of normality came back. ButI was left with a wriggling feeling in my stomach. It didn‚Äôt go away as the evening marched on. In fact, it only grew worse until I found myself in bed rolling from side to side and thinking about Mom‚Äôs question. The men who‚Äôd bundled Dad off hadn‚Äôt seemed like the kind who messed around. They must have had some idea what was going on, so why ask about meat?

On some level, I knew the moment she‚Äôd asked me why it was relevant. Dad loved to hunt and he always brought meat to parties and barbecues. Wasn‚Äôt it obvious? He‚Äôd brought something back from the woods, hadn‚Äôt he? I hadn‚Äôt gone hunting for a long time. Nearly three months. Every time he‚Äôd asked I‚Äôd refused and I think he knew why.¬†

On the very last trip, Dad shot three deer but we only brought back two. One for us. One for the town barbecue. The third he shot but we left it on the forest floor because by the time it had died I was pale and shaking and even Dad couldn‚Äôt keep the tremor out of his voice. Neither of us had expected the deer to stand up on its hind legs and walk towards us like a man, its gait a heavy and broken thing as it lumbered over the forest floor.¬†

And it had kept coming even after Dad shot it six more times. One of the rounds struck it in the head, but still it shambled forward on two misshapen legs as its brains painted the ferns a pestilent grey. When it finally fell, even Dad had gone pale and in the silent aftermath I had to go off and be sick in a bush. After that we cut the trip short. Dad walked me gently back to the truck where the two deer we‚Äôd shot and trussed earlier that day lay waiting in the pickup. I don‚Äôt think either of us even remembered they were there until later.¬†

He‚Äôd still ask if I wanted to head out with him each weekend, but he never seemed surprised when I made some excuse. The only time we talked about it was not long before the barbecue when he drove me to school one day. He didn‚Äôt deal with it head on. He skirted the topic.¬†

*Sometimes deer get sick,* he‚Äôd told me. *A little like old folks do. Remember Grampa? He got real scary towards the end, didn‚Äôt he? Well deer get sick too. But we don‚Äôt have to worry. Same way you couldn‚Äôt catch what Grampa had, well we can‚Äôt catch what the deer have. Us humans are safe. Just‚Ä¶ just an uncomfortable part of nature.*

It had come outta the blue, or at least it‚Äôd seemed like it. I figured it was Dad‚Äôs way of trying to get me back onboard with hunting. I knew he liked me going with him. I‚Äôd liked it too, at least until I‚Äôd seen that deer walk towards me on two legs. But lying in my bed that night after Mom had gone to sleep, I started to wonder if maybe he hadn‚Äôt really been trying to convince me. Maybe he carried a little doubt in himself about something he was gonna do.¬†

What if he‚Äôd been trying to convince himself it was okay?

Two deer. I tried remembering what they‚Äôd been like. I hadn‚Äôt checked them after we got in the truck. Why would I? Seemed as normal as any others as we tied them down, but I hadn‚Äôt really been paying attention either. I‚Äôd been hunting since I was seven. Helping Dad was automatic to me. And to top it off, I hadn‚Äôt known what I was meant to be looking for.¬†

I squirmed beneath the sheets and tried so hard to remember every detail of that trip. Most of all I tried to remember what the first two deer Dad had shot were like. They‚Äôd gone down so quick, they‚Äôd seemed normal. But Grampa had been sick with Alzheimer‚Äôs a long time before he got scary, and I had to figure the same could be true of those deer. Who was to say the one on hind legs was the only sick creature in the woods that day?

I couldn‚Äôt have forced these thoughts out of my head with a crowbar. At some point I accepted I wasn‚Äôt getting any sleep that night and I settled down to torture myself some more until I realised it didn‚Äôt have to be that way. Dad had an old freezer in the shed and he sometimes kept meat in there. Not for long, and usually not for eating. He‚Äôd use it for things he wanted to skin or try and make a trophy out of tt, which he rarely did since Mom didn‚Äôt like that kind of thing in the house. But if the deer weren‚Äôt in the freezer in the kitchen or the garage, then they might be in the shed. And if I did open up that chest and saw two deer bodies in there, that meant whatever was going around and making people hurt themselves couldn‚Äôt have come from our little hunting trip.

I snuck out my room as quietly as I could. Mom was on the phone with my Grandma and she was crying. I stopped briefly by her door and listened to see if maybe they knew something I didn‚Äôt, but after she started talking about how scared she was I just felt bad and moved on. At least it meant she was too busy to notice me creeping down the stairs.

I never liked the shed at the end of the yard. It was rarely used, even by my Dad who kept the lawn mower and some old junk in there. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of place you kept food but I had this feeling he didn‚Äôt keep these deer with the rest of the meat he got from hunting. As I opened the backdoor and looked over the shadow-covered yard I found myself thinking about the tunnel and what I‚Äôd seen back there. With everything that had happened since, I‚Äôd done a good job of convincing myself it‚Äôd never really happened. The man with no legs who dragged himself out of the darkness had become little more than a half-remembered nightmare. A moment out of time that was incompatible with all logic and reason. But suddenly it was back with me. All the emotions and thoughts that raced through my head as I‚Äôd stared at his rotten flesh and glassy eyes.¬†

The walk to the shed wasn‚Äôt easy. I fought the urge to turn around the entire way there. Each step was like walking on feet made of lead. At the door, I paused with my hand poised by the lock. The house seemed so distant behind me, and I became painfully aware nobody knew I was alone and out in the dark.¬†

Inside was nearly pitch black. My phone helped me light it up a little, but I didn‚Äôt touch the nearby switch in case Mom saw it from her window. Cobwebs hung low from the ceiling, and shadows crawled across the floor and walls as I moved closer to the freezer. The entire time I kept expecting something to happen. I even imagined that deer rising from beneath the lid, pushing it open to stand unnaturally tall on its hind legs where it looked down at me with the same dead eyes I‚Äôd seen in my father. The thought scared me so bad I nearly hyperventilated myself straight into a panic attack, but before I had time to really worry about any of that I found my hand on the freezer latch.¬†

I pushed it open and looked inside. The misty vapours cleared to reveal a pile of meat and fur encrusted with ice. There was only one head visible, but I so badly wanted confirmation that there were two animals in there that I took a deep breath and reached in to try and pry some of it loose. Some of it came away from the sides with a sound like duct tape, but no matter how deep I rooted around in that mound of bone, antlers, and rock-hard flesh, I couldn‚Äôt see a sign of the second deer.¬†

Had Dad really served everyone sick meat? Was that really why Larry Sitkins, Mr Straub, and all those other people had killed themselves?

The thought made me feel ill. I slammed the freezer shut and walked back to the door in a daze, trying with all my might to swallow the painful weight that settled in my gut.¬†

I had one foot outside when the freezer door rattled against the latch.

The entire world spun around me. My heart sank and my skin froze in a sensation that was growing increasingly familiar. I turned to face the sound, both hands braced against the door, and watched as the hatch slammed into the lock once more. The light inside the chest came on for the briefest of moments and I glimpsed thrashing fur and teeth. Then it happened again, and again, and each time I saw bits of hoof and bone and strange musculature that frightened me so deeply I fell down onto my ass and didn‚Äôt even realise.¬†

When the latch finally gave way, the lid flew open and stayed there. Light poured out of the box and I waited, breath held, for that thing to emerge. To come roaring out of sight and bear down towards me on unnatural legs. But nothing happened. The silence stretched on for what seemed like an eternity until, at last, there was a crash louder than any before and the entire freezer rocked back and forth and slowly fell over.¬†

The deer, or parts of it, fell out with a hard, wet, *thump*. Bits of its chin and face shattered on the hard packed ground, sending little shards of meat and bone skating across the floor on melting streaks of blood. Some of them even reached my feet.¬†

The thing inside moved with the sound of snow crunching beneath your feet. Its thick neck and broken head twisting side to side, scanning the shed‚Äôs interior with faulty eyes. I‚Äôve never seen anything move like that. Not before or since. This was worse than the man in the tunnel. Worse by a thousand times. The deer was still mostly frozen but some impossible force was making fight the crystallised water in its own cells and the result was skin that ripped like tissue and muscles that cracked and crunched as they tried to flex and contract.¬†

It lifted its head and tried to scream. The breathy sound that left its fuzzy black lips made my heart start skipping beats while my bladder emptied. I couldn‚Äôt help it. Couldn‚Äôt stop myself. And when I looked down and saw pieces of melting flesh start to writhe and wriggle, I tried with all my might to stifle the cry building up in my throat, but it still escaped as a desperate, high pitched whine.¬†

The deer turned its head towards me with a violent swing. Another breathy shriek and then it began to thrash its stiff and frozen legs in a terrifying attempt to get closer. To say it had a predatory look would be inaccurate. Anyone who‚Äôs seen a predator in action knows that nature is mostly indifferent when it kills. A bear tears into its prey with the same dull look of someone opening their McDonalds. Predators don‚Äôt hate the things they hunt. But this *thing*. I could feel its hatred. Its malice. It was nothing like what I‚Äôd seen in my Dad‚Äôs eyes or even the eyes of the man in the tunnel.¬†

But it had spent months in that box, hadn‚Äôt it? This was the disease when you skipped three months ahead. Anger. Hatred. Jesus Christ, I couldn‚Äôt even say if it was gonna eat me. That‚Äôs what you think when you see a zombie, right? It‚Äôs gonna try and take a big bite outta you. But this frozen clump of hair and meat and braying lips dragged itself across the floor with an expression like murderous rage. The look of someone ready to beat another living thing to death using its own hands if it had to.

Unable to face it a moment longer, I dragged myself back onto my feet and fled, shutting my eyes as I entered the cold night air.¬†

I made it three steps before I slammed into my Dad.

\-

It was like I‚Äôd run full speed into a tree. I bounced back and hit the earth, pain flaring up my coccyx as my father loomed over me. He‚Äôd felt cold for the brief moment where we‚Äôd made contact. My mind blocked out the sound of something hideous scrambling in the shed behind me, and the entire world narrowed until it was just the face of the man who‚Äôd raised me, looking down with pale dead eyes.¬†

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

He swallowed, then briefly examined his hands.¬†

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm dead,‚Äù he muttered, almost as if he was talking to himself. ‚ÄúWhen did I die?‚Äù

I pulled myself up and grabbed his hand. He was cold, but his pulse was racing. I could even see the veins in his forearms throb sickeningly.¬†

‚ÄúDad? Are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey told me I‚Äôm sick,‚Äù he said, his eyes gazing vacantly at the empty space behind me. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre right. But there‚Äôs more.‚Äù

He looked at me, the intensity of his gaze so powerful that I let go of his hand and took a step back. For the first time in my life, I was scared of him.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone in here,‚Äù he said, his voice pleading for help. Slowly, his expression twisted into a grotesque mask of agony and desperation.¬† ‚ÄúOh Jesus! It isn‚Äôt just me in here!‚Äù

I tried to move but he was a big man, and his arms wrapped around me like steel bands.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I cried, struggling to pull myself loose as he sobbed louder and louder. ‚ÄúDad! Jesus! You gotta let me go there‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù

The shed door burst open. I managed to twist around just enough I could see what came out, and I felt an urgent terror crawling up my flesh. The deer had pulled itself loose from the freezer, and it now stood in the doorway on two legs. Its body looked all wrong in that posture, like when you twist the limbs around on a doll. Probably not far from the truth, thinking about it.¬†

Dad didn‚Äôt react, but I began to scream as the nightmare coalesced around me. My father gripping, holding me in place as that horrible thing lurched towards me on two legs. It moved like claymation or a puppet show gone wrong, but it was quicker than I‚Äôd feared. As each strep brought it closer, I found myself losing what little control I had. I started to scream. Started to *shriek*. I beat at my father with my fists, but he didn‚Äôt budge an inch. My clenched hands just bounced off his strong shoulders, and it was like I was trying to hurt a punching bag. I started to swear too. Started to scream things I thought were bad, then worse, then so bad I‚Äôm not even sure I can blame other people for putting those words in my head. I told my Dad I hated him. Called him a son of a bitch. Called him even worse.¬†

All that commotion got the attention of others. Neighbors‚Äô lights started coming on. My mom emerged from the backdoor, wrapping her robe around herself as she squinted at us in the dark.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on!?‚Äù she cried as she stumbled towards us, but when she saw that deer, she started screaming too.¬†

I don‚Äôt know why but I thought that other people appearing would help somehow. That as two, three, half-a-dozen people came stumbling into the open lawns, peering over waist-high fences, it‚Äôd stop the slow but inevitable onslaught of that monster. It did no such thing. I had to listen to their confused shouts and cries while gesturing and begging for help, the entire time the sound of the creature over my shoulder getting closer and closer. Meanwhile, my hands tried to pry away my father‚Äôs thick arms but each time I got leverage he simply flexed and his grip tightened around me. He was muttering something the whole time, but I couldn‚Äôt hear it.¬†

Finally, my Mom screamed and ran swinging an old rake at the space behind me. I heard the impact. The splintering of the wooden handle. Then she stumbled backwards and I had to twist to get a look at the deer that was now just six or seven feet away, the spokes of a rake still sticking out of its face.¬†

The monster looked right at me and opened its mouth and I swear to fucking God it was gonna talk, but right then someone shouted,¬†

‚ÄúFor the love of God Alice, get away from that thing!‚Äù

Alice was my mother‚Äôs name, and she fell to the floor just seconds before an explosion broke the night, silencing all voices and shattering the deer‚Äôs head like a crystal ball hitting the ground.¬†

My heart raced so fast I thought for a moment I was gonna die. Then I looked down at Dad and finally heard what he‚Äôd been mumbling this whole time.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in us and it wants us. It‚Äôs in us and it wants us. It‚Äôs in us and it wants us‚Ä¶‚Äù

\-

There isn‚Äôt much left of Dad these days. I got to visit a couple times. Fat lot of good it did. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, he died that day in the kitchen when he first tried shooting himself.¬†

They‚Äôre treating us in this special hospital. Mom was real upset that visitations are limited but‚Ä¶ I think it might be for the best. Her and my sister tested clean. Most people did.¬†

I didn‚Äôt.

Mom snuck me this phone a couple weeks ago and I been using that to write. Funny thing is one of the orderlies saw me on it a few days ago and just laughed. I think that maybe the government aren‚Äôt too worried about this story getting out. At first I didn‚Äôt really get why until I started actually putting all this down into writing. Got to the part where that half-man came out the tunnel and I realised no one‚Äôs gonna believe me.

Still, I gotta try. Partly cause I wanna protect people. Whatever this disease is, it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more than some twisted prions and I think the government knows that. Dad certainly did. Most infected did too. That‚Äôs why they killed themselves. They wanted out. The voice that comes with this illness is like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like if your brain is just words in a book and then someone dipped that book in a can full of used motor oil. You just wanna give in. Hand it all over. It wants your body so whatever you do, don‚Äôt fight. That‚Äôs worse. Give it up.¬†

In hindsight, we should‚Äôve let Dad kill himself. What he went through was‚Ä¶ well it was probably a lot worse than the others who got to die.

I sometimes think about going into his room with a pillow, but security is pretty tight around him.¬†

As for me, infection is still in its early phase. It takes everyone differently, and for me it‚Äôs taking quite its time. They think it‚Äôs because of my age. Still, I can sorta feel it under there. Growing.¬†

I think it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.¬†

It wants me to.¬†

This sickness, it lives out in the woods. Way way out, in parts of the soil where the sun hasn‚Äôt shone in millions of years. It‚Äôs old enough to remember a time you could walk from Appalachia to what‚Äôs now called Glasgow. And it‚Äôs been fumbling around out there, in the brains of deer and other things.¬†

The sickness tells me this. Tells me it‚Äôs learning about this new world. Tells me how my mind tastes.

But most of all‚Ä¶¬†

It tells me it‚Äôs getting closer. ",12,1753461589.0,u_ChristianWallis,0,0.93,False

# 1.Chapter 1 Three Years' Punishment

""I'm warning you one last time‚Äîkeep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers‚ÄîMichael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times‚Äîhim finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him‚Äîhe was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me‚Äîdo you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment‚Äîshe'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember‚Äîhe was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fianc√© can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement‚Äîrisking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate‚Äîsurely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment‚Äîmerciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women‚Äîtools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back‚Äînot out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone‚Äînow it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No‚Ä¶ please don't‚Ä¶ don't touch me‚Ä¶""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael‚Äîor her parents‚Äîshe had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth‚Äîshe'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson‚Äîthe girl who'd lived her life‚Äîfelt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned‚Äîvomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away‚Äîbanished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp‚Äîbelieving that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back‚Ä¶ then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim‚Äîputting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena‚Äîlet alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage‚ÄîI don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties‚Äîfor good. Just‚Ä¶ not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter‚Äîso thin and pale, her eyes distant‚Äîand her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter‚Äîstill her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good‚Äîfor your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me‚Ä¶""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant‚Äîgive her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family‚Äîwe should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier‚ÄîEloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained‚Äîshe's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you‚Äîshe told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her‚Äîand for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn‚Äîthat kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside‚Äîyour father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing‚Äîbut somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it‚ÄîMichael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great‚Äîshe's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family‚Äîbut she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now‚Äîof marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house‚Äîwhile Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed‚Äîclearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now‚Äîlooking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous‚Äîfour dishes and a soup‚Äîbut the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten‚Äîthis wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat‚Äîit was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners‚Äîshe looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly‚Ä¶""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them‚Äîcalm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises‚Äîsome new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine‚Äîsoft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow‚Äîagain.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty‚Äîfor her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now‚Ä¶ it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door‚Äîand frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear‚Äîwhat I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""‚Äînot ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years‚Ä¶ how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes‚ÄîAthena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl‚Ä¶ you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless‚Ä¶ I couldn't protect you‚Ä¶""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened‚Ä¶

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word‚Äîand Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now‚Ä¶ and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars‚Äîblackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor‚Ä¶ how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries‚Äîhow did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course‚Ä¶""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten‚Äîfor three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fianc√©'s command‚Äîhow could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes‚Äîbut it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak‚Äîwhen Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak‚Äîif I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine‚ÄîAthena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents‚Ä¶""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is‚Äîwhat are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow‚Äîoffering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course‚Ä¶ she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield‚ÄîHenry Monson‚Äîwalked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'‚Äîwhat, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her‚Äîbut her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face‚Äîbut before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it‚Äîshe's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this‚Ä¶""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt‚Ä¶ I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen‚Äîyet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look‚Äîbut when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician‚Äîit's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly‚Äîit'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just‚Ä¶ don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it‚Äîand saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness‚Ä¶ I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'

# 6.Chapter 6 Replace Her

The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.

When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.

The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.

Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""

Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""

Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""

Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue‚Äîbut his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.

Athena understood then‚Äîhe was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.

She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.

Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""

He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away‚Äîand truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.

""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""

Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""

Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""

Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""

""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""

""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.

Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone‚Äîvery discreetly‚Äîto suggest replacing her in the engagement.

Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.

Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""

She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp‚Äîher reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.

Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off‚Ä¶ They just want to marry someone else instead.""

Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.

It all made sense now.

Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.

But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow‚Äîpure, innocent Willow‚Äîwould be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.

Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation‚Äîyet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.

No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them‚Äîshe wouldn't give them that satisfaction.

""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""

Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.

""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.

Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.

But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""

At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.

Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.

The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made‚Äîso she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'

Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""

But she knew in her heart‚ÄîMichael had been the best they could hope for.

With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.

Margaret felt a stab of grief‚Äîher precious Athena had endured too much.

But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""

""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""

She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.

Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.

As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""

Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""

""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.

Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly‚ÄîMichael was standing right in front of her.

Backlit by the sunlight, he looked like a cold shadow descending upon her.

""Athena,"" he said, coming to a halt in front of her. His tall frame instantly blocked the sun.

The chill that radiated from him made her shiver. Even after three years, being this close still left a dull ache in her chest.

Suddenly, Michael seized her thin wrist, his voice low and icy. ""This engagement was settled years ago. You don't get to walk away from it.""

**Coffee Review #08 ‚Äì Luminous ‚Äì Cascabel Ecuador**

**Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Coffee:** Cascabel Ecuador  
**Roaster:** Luminous  
**Producer:** Leopoldo Andrade (La Josefina Estate)  
**Country:** Ecuador  
**Region:** El Chaco (Cascabel)  
**Process:** Anaerobic Double Fermentation Washed  
**Altitude:** 1,800 m.a.s.l.  
**Varietal:** Typica Mejorado  
**Roast Date:** March 14, 2025

**BREW DETAILS**

* **Method:** Pour Over
* **Roast Level:** Light
* **Grinder:** K-Ultra
* **Grind Size:** \#8
* **Dripper:** D27
* **Water:** TWW 50% dilution
* **Water Temp:** 200¬∞F
* **Ratio:** 1:17
* **Dose:** 10g
* **Total Brew Time:** 2:05
* **Pour Recipe:**
   * **0:00:** 52g
   * **0:30:** 91g (39g)
   * **0:50:** 130g (39g)
   * **1:10:** 170g (40g)

**TASTING NOTES**

The fragrance is medium to medium-low intensity - quite mild with nothing particularly interesting standing out. The washed process seems to have mellowed out any potential anaerobic activity that might have provided more aromatic complexity.

The aroma remains medium-low, similar to the fragrance. It's fairly tame without notable fermented characteristics, though I do detect slight cacao notes.

Flavor intensity sits at medium-plus, presenting salty and bitter notes as the main taste components. The aftertaste has medium intensity and fades nicely without lingering too long. Sweetness registers at medium levels, though I'm not getting the expected tart notes.

The mouthfeel is medium and round with a pleasant slurping quality. Acidity comes through at medium-low intensity - it's present but soft and well-integrated.

On the flavor profile, I detect some florals, though they lean more toward the tea family rather than bright floral notes. I get hints of the tart character mentioned in the roaster's notes, and some floral qualities do come through, but both feel somewhat muted.

Overall, this presents as a middle-of-the-road cup. It's pleasant and approachable, but nothing really stands out as exceptional. While I'm glad to have experienced this coffee, it probably wouldn't make my repurchase list.

**Kendu Sneakers**

But today I am gonna focus on the new one: Handmade leather sneakers in Italy! They are made from pristine, Italian leather and also feature genuine Italian materials throughout. This is a father-son project, made by mastercraftsman. The shoes are a 70s college sports-inspired design and are great for casual activities and walking. These shoes are limited edition, collectors items so are gonna be so sought after when Kendu is in the 10s of billions... This is by far one of my favourite projects under the Kendu umbrella, they look so good and nothing beats handmade shoes. Did I mention, that all shoes are 100% returnable, no questions asked? Yep, you can order these trouble free.

You simply cannot find this Kendu mentality elsewhere and that's why we are going to the very top, Kendu is expanding into every industry in the world and it's only gonna get more and more extensive. Kendu is simply unignorable, imo our path to success is predetermined and written in the stars, I have never seen anything like this ever!

I'm currently deep in my dark romance era (don't judge my questionable life choices!) and fueled by copious amounts of coffee and the sheer will to survive.

Basically, I'm looking for a friend who understands that ""me time"" means hiding in the pantry with a bag of chips, someone who won't bat an eye when I show up in sweatpants, and who ideally also enjoys a good morally grey hero. Bonus points if you can commiserate about the joys of parenting.

Starter Freddy Peralta (2.85 ERA) is as close to flawless at home as a pitcher and be, friends; the man is a perfect 7-0. Peralta‚Äôs last 5 straight starts for Milwaukee have resulted in a Brewers win by at least 5 runs, and his last 6 starts have seen the Over cash. On the other side, while starter Cal Quantrill (5.24 ERA) is certainly one of the Marlins better pitchers, his 6.20 ERA on the road is a far cry from Peralta‚Äôs 1.53 at home. After watching Milwaukee leave the Mariners and Seattle starter Luis Castillo in the dust, my money‚Äôs on the Brewers to cover the RL today.¬†

Married: Take a moment during the reception to step back with your partner and soak it all in, just the two of you. The day flies by, and that little pause to be present together becomes such a special memory.

Engaged: How do you make decisions when you‚Äôre torn between what you want and what would make your guests happy?

She could put the key in and unlock the door, but forgot the routine of locking it. But then she started remembering again.

Her friend and neighbour visits for coffee multiple times a week, and with the confusement with the locks, we gave him a key to let himself in and out. But over the last few months my grandma has ended up with this obsession over the lock on the door. She‚Äôs seen us on the driveway sometimes cleaning the car or just chatting to neighbours, and she‚Äôs come along, shut the door and managed to lock us out. Or on days her neighbour comes round, she messes about with the key in the mock, and over the last few months especially, she‚Äôs been leaving the door unlocked, or struggled to unlock it but her friend can‚Äôt get in because her key is in the door.

This morning was one of those days. We‚Äôve recently started removing keys from view near the door to prevent being locked out and her friend struggling to get in and double check the door lock is free of keys in itself before we go to bed. We have a coat rail where we‚Äôve been keeping them in a coat pocket that she wouldn‚Äôt think to look. 

This morning she came upstairs whilst me and my partner were getting dressed and really loudly banged on our door in a panic that her friend couldn‚Äôt get in and he was walking back home. She slowly headed back downstairs on her stairlift and I followed. I saw the keys in the lock and automatically assumed they‚Äôd been left in overnight. ‚ÄúYou just need to pull the key out of the door.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚ÄôVE TRIED THAT!‚Äù 

Got to the door, opened it, managed to shout her friend back over and they got on with their morning. 

My partner said to me that she must have messed with the key this morning and put it in the lock, forgetting how to then use it. And it made me realise she was right, I check it every night as we head upstairs. There‚Äôs been a few car thefts in the area recently and I have this awful thought of the window on the door being smashed and the key in the door turned to get in, so I‚Äôve been double, triple, quadruple checking every single night that those keys aren‚Äôt in the door. We must have left them on the side by accident and she‚Äôs then messed with it.

I tried to gently tell her, once her friend had left, that she must have put the key in the door. But she was adamant she hadn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to argue, nor is there ever any reasoning with a dementia patient. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs done it without thinking, or was lying to me but overall it‚Äôs got me questioning my sanity today. Did I leave the keys in the door last night?!‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I going mad?!‚Äù ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1) To talk me off a ledge

2) More practically, to give me some tips on protection and what preventative measures I can take.

Apologies in advance for the length, but details up front always feel important on reddit.

I live in Chicago, land of the bedbugs. Earlier this week I found a beautiful wooden headboard in an alley in my neighborhood. I know what you're thinking, but stay with me. Chicago's alley game is fierce. People throw away incredible things. I always abide by a few rules to keep myself safe: 1) never, ever collect anything that is upholstered, cloth, clothes, etc., and 2) inspect, inspect, inspect, + wash hands/sanitize after touching anything, and 3) clean/sanitize the shit out of anything collected before bringing it inside.

Alright, so. I come across this beautiful wooden headboard on my way to work the other day, and I do my best to inspect every inch of it before touching it. It's got some holes in the base where it's been screwed into a frame, but other than that, its nooks and crannies look clean. No telltale signs as far as I can see? And obviously no bugs crawling on it. So I threw it in the back of my pickup which has a camper shell. I ended up carting it around with me for about a day or so because I am working two jobs this week and haven't wanted to remove it before I have time/space to really clean it. Last night we were supposed to get rain, and my shell isn't really fully sealed, so I didn't want it to get soaked and ruined. So after coming home from a bartending shift after dark, I carried it carefully to my back porch so it could wait outside and I could thoroughly disinfect it in the morning. This is where I think I f\*cked up. 

This morning, I waltzed outside with my gloves, disinfectant spray and cleaning supplies. And just as I think I've got every bit covered, every nook looked over, I noticed a little bug moving along the top of it. I tried to catch it in a paper towel to inspect, but crushed it, and bright red blood came out of it. That did it for me. I sprayed the thing down again, and immediately walked it to the dumpster, washed my hands. Took off my clothes and inspected them, inspected my body, and then cried a little lol. 

**Thanks for reading this far. My questions are this:** I know bedbugs can travel pretty far, but how far do they wander around looking for a host? How freaked out should I be for leaving this furniture on my back porch for 11 hours? Is that long enough for them to decide my apartment is worth intruding for juicy meat? Me seeing one makes me believe there were more hiding in the headboard. I'm already self flagellating enough, but how can I protect my home from a preventative standpoint, assuming one or two crawled their little butts through a crack in the backdoor? I obviously intend to sweep/mop, clean around the doorframe, walk around with a magnifying glass and all manner of manic but maybe misguided measures. But what can I **\*really\*** do? Am I overreacting, and I shouldn't really be worried? Or will I make a mistake assuming it's unlikely they came in at all? What can I realistically do to make sure I didn't just infest my apartment on accident?

Now, I know that I am actually already incredibly vulnerable to picking up bedbugs in this city, especially riding public transit. A few years ago my housemate and I bought a coffee table from a thrift store, and after about a week I got some mystery clustered bites after sitting with my legs under it. I cleaned/sanitized the hell out of it and we panic cleaned for about a week and nothing came of that. So I'm clinging to that episode with the logic that those were actually IN the house for several days and we didn't get infested, and that's making me feel a little better about it. But you know how this goes. Panic rules. Please give me your recommendations.

And before anyone asks: my truck bed/camper shell are separated from the cab of the truck; there is no possible connection from the truck to the cab (like a window), so it is extremely unlikely any would have made it into the cab with me. Plus we're in a heatwave so i don't think they'd have survived internal cab temps after a 105 degree heat index (outside) for two days if one somehow made its way in there. I'm not worried about my truck, just about my apartment.

Anyway, lesson learned. Help is appreciated. ",1,1753460757.0,Bedbugs,2,1.0,False

first of all he says he wants some friends with benefits but refuses any of his friends to be this kind of thing, he started talking to a girl hoping she would be his fwb and when we told him that fwb don't work like that he said he only wants to hit once then they can be friends :/

the problem also lies with him thinking that the girl is giving him a green light but our shared friend says she is into me not him (she is bi).

  
so my question is wtf is this guy's motives and wtf should i do .",0,1753460693.0,AskMenRelationships,4,0.33,False

Three days ago I lost Speckles, my elderly cat baby. 

I got her as my 5th birthday present, and she‚Äôs been at my side ever since. She lived a full life, allowed to be an outdoor/indoor cat in her youth who swam in creeks and hunted corn snakes and mice. She became a fat and lazy birdwatcher after a while, and then when she followed me to college as an old lady, was the neediest, sweetest snuggle bug. I graduated college last year and just finished my first year of full time employment. Over the years she has been my companion and constant through long term breakups, losses, and dark depressions. Only a week ago I was telling others how content and happy I was truly feeling for the first time. She‚Äôs seen me through my entire youth. 

I am so grief stricken and also feeling guilt. Her CKD was starting to truly show the last few months, and in truth, she was a terrible patient. She was slowing down and threw up a lot, refused her kidney food. The last couple weeks she didn‚Äôt carry her stuffy, Mr. Clownfish around, mostly sauntered around and slapped blinds/boxes when she wasn‚Äôt climbing on the couch to cuddle. 

She had a spike for some reason and went downhill fast last weekend. Monday the vet recommend we consider euthanasia, and we had an at home euthanasia appointment scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. She hated the vet and needles. We went straight to my parent‚Äôs house to let her see the bird feeder, sit on the patio, and eat ice cream and salmon pur√©e. We all woke up early Tuesday morning and she was pressed against me, obviously going. She didn‚Äôt make it long enough for the vet to open and us give her an easy passing. She was agonally breathing while I held her and sang to her. At one point she was quickly kneading my stomach. I feel sick thinking about it. I don‚Äôt even know if she knew I was there. I feel like I caused her to suffer. 

Everything feels so empty. No waking me up in the middle of the night for attention, no cuddles under the blanket while I drink my coffee, no yelling at me when I get home from work or walk off to use the restroom. The window is empty. The couch is too clean. I‚Äôve found myself ruminating on everything the last few days. I wish I had more pictures, I wish she wasn‚Äôt living in apartments the last few years, I wish she could‚Äôve gone outside more in her final days. She gave me so much, and I feel like I didn‚Äôt give her enough. I miss her so, so dearly.

I'm 28M, traveling to Paris for the first time for work, but I‚Äôve added two extra days to explore the city on my own. I noticed that the cycling infrastructure is really well developed, and there are plenty of bike rental options available through different apps.

I was wondering if anyone else is interested in discovering the city by bike this Sunday. I‚Äôve planned a route from my hotel near the Seine to the city center, passing by the main tourist attractions. The idea is to park the bike in key spots, explore a bit on foot, then continue riding.

Unfortunately, my French is quite limited, but I speak English and Spanish.

**P.S.:** We could also stop for a coffee along the way‚ÄîI've seen that there are plenty of nice spots near the bike parking areas.

**P.P.S.:** This will be a slow-paced ride, perfect for sightseeing and taking photos, so I‚Äôd love to team up with other people who are into this vibe.

1m93lyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m93lyq/aitah_for_making_someone_clean_up_their_own_mess/,AITAH for making someone clean up their own mess,"A little context: I(37f) am a janitor at a factory, so cleaning up messes and whatnot IS technically my job. I am a mother of 3 and had my first child when I was 19, so until now I‚Äôve never had time to go after a career I really wanted. So, I work 2 jobs, one as a janitor, and Im in school finally pursuing my dreams. 

So, most of the people in the factory treat me with a lot of kindness, but there are a handful of them who are rude or will order me around as if they‚Äôre my boss. Usually I just ignore it and get through the day, but yesterday I just was not feeling it. 

I was on my unpaid lunch break, enjoying a cup of coffee in the break room. 2 younger gentlemen, I would assume between 18-20 or so, who I see around frequently, came in and sat at the table across from me. They were giggling to themselves and I was more or less just not paying attention to them. I heard one of them whisper ""do it it‚Äôll be so funny"". I looked over at them and one pulled out a can of soda, shook it, pointed it away from himself, and opened it. He then said ""hey cleaning lady we got a BIG spill over here"" and they both started laughing. 

I was exhausted, annoyed, and frankly moments away from quitting and finding a new job in that moment. I stood up, went to the janitor closet, grabbed the mop and some paper towels, came back to the breakroom, and handed it to them. I said ""if you need any sprays or anything help yourself to the janitor closet"" they were just staring back at me like I was insane. One of them started to say something but I walked away and i took my coffee with me outside. 

Now, when I got back from my break, they had cleaned it up, poorly, but got a majority of it off the floor and table. So, i finished cleaning it up finished up my day, and went to my other job. 

It felt good to make them clean up after themselves, but I wonder if maybe I should have just done it? It is my job, after all. So, AITA?

TLDR: a couple of college age guys intentionally made a mess because they thought it would be funny to watch me clean it up(im a janitor) but I made them clean it up themselves.

Thought‚Äã I'd share some lessons learned for anyone ‚Å§considering‚Å¢ going all-in.

First, interoperability‚Å§ is a HUGE headache. I envisioned everything seamlessly talking too‚Å£ each other,‚Å¢ but quickly discovered that wasn't the case. Different brands use different protocols, and even within ‚Å§the same brand, older devices might not play nicely with newer ‚Äãones. I've got a ‚Äçlighting system that only ‚Å¢half-works with my voice assistant, and a thermostat that refuses‚Å£ to acknowledge my‚Äã smart blinds. Research compatibility‚Äç *before* you buy anything, and maybe even stick to a single ecosystem as much as possible.

Second, don't underestimate the complexity of installation. What I‚Äã thought‚Å£ would be a weekend project turned into weeks of frustration involving rewiring, troubleshooting ‚Äånetwork issues, and countless calls to ‚Äåcustomer support. Unless you're genuinely agreeable ‚Å§with‚Äç electrical work and have strong‚Å£ networking skills, consider hiring‚Äç a professional. The money you save trying to DIY might end up costing you more in the long run, both in terms of time ‚Äåand potential damage.

consider ‚Äçthe ""why."" I got caught up in the‚Å¢ cool factor and bought gadgets‚Äå I didn't really need. Now I have a smart ‚Å¢fridge that mostly ‚Å§just‚Äå tells me I'm out of ‚Äãmilk, and a ‚Äçvoice-controlled coffee maker that's less‚Äã reliable than my old drip machine. Think about what problems you're actually trying to‚Å£ solve and focus on those rather than ‚Å¢trying‚Å£ to ‚Å¢automate everything just because you ‚Å§can. Anyone else have similar experiences or hard-won wisdom to share?",1,1753460471.0,NestMakers,0,1.0,False

In the beginning, I would start a project, when it was time to write, I chicken out and start something different. Then I starting writing like this as my rough drafts:

Cafe - Closing time 10pm.

* 3 Characters ( Rick, Sarah, and Mat)
* Cafe vibes: Cozy, warm lighting, plant vines hanging, jazz music playing.
* Rick is behind the counter wiping down spilled soda, coffee cup rings, and bits of food.
* Sarah is cleaning the tables, back towards Rick.
* Mat is in the back cleaning.
* Rick : Sarah (shyness in his tone)
* Sara turns around, ponytail swings: Yeah (soft)

I figured writing it out this way made it less intimidating. I know this is how most writers outline. But I didn't want to worry about word formatting, dialogue placement, the right verbs or adjectives. I just needed to write what I saw in my head in the most simplest way possible.

Purchased this Rebuilt title ND2 a month ago for a whopping 7k @ 56k miles, private sale. Sold so cheap because the dude was in debt, and the car has some obvious cosmetic issues. Didn‚Äôt even expect him to agree at that price, I was actually saving for an accord because I have to lug a pretty decent amount of stuff to work everyday. But I mean at 7k??? I can drive it.
Got a PPI, and the car is mechanically sound.

I‚Äôm mostly looking for advice/mod recommendations for some things I‚Äôve noticed.  
Plus any general recommendations. Budget is decent because the car was so cheap!
I do daily the car, so mods that are daily friendly, and won‚Äôt eat too much mileage or make the car too inconvenient to drive.

The car takes every little dip in the road pretty poorly. 
The car vibrates pretty aggressively at high speeds (75+). 
The wind buffeting even with the top up, is a bit loud. 

Car is stock but I did put 215 tires on the front to match the back.

Other than that, any advice on fixing the misalignment of the bumper (maybe a replacement?) or the name of the square thing missing on the front. I know taking it to a bodywork shop it the solution, but I figured I would ask.

Thanks! I appreciate this sub for shilling the car so hard, I finally get it!
