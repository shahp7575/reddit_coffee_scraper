Basically minimum wage yung base pay tapos  they threw in a little allowance nalang. 
Now they're restructuring and they put me on floating status, so I decided I might as well use this time to look for a new job. But I really need my salary from January, pang start over sa job hunting. We were supposed to get paid 5 days ago. Hanggang ngayon wala pa.
Pansin ko na every payday may mga na dedelay na pay pero sana nag communicate man lang kung may issue since inalis ako sa gc nung bigla nalang akong nasa floating status. The night ng payday I sent 1 message for any info and they told me wala pang update yung payroll. The second night I had to follow up and same lang sinabi. The third night I sent two messages kasi di sila nag rereply. It was a polite message, I was respectfully asking for an update since I'm concerned given my status.
 I was told to be patient, fyi daw pati daw yung iba wala pang pay even her na nasa management. Like ako pa dapat mahiya na nanghihingi ako ng update sa delayed pay ko while I'm on unpaid  floating status which is already stressful enough. That time isang  pancit canton lang ang meal ko for the whole day. Buti na lang di pa ubos yung brewed coffee at sugar.
Kaya lang naman ako nagsend ng two messages that night kasi night before weekend na, walang office ng weekends.

I am late to this party but am definitely willing to do what I can to get information out in appropriate contexts and look for common ground.

My first takeaway: when asked what Trump‚Äôs position was on an issue important to the Trump supporter, he didn‚Äôt even try to articulate it.  Instead he gave his own!  I don‚Äôt think we need to underestimate the power of this.  If people are stating their own positions it is easier to find compromise than it is with Trump‚Äôs heavy-handedness.  Also there is probably some observation regarding psychology here to be made, the person assuming his position is the same as Trump‚Äôs, identifying with Trump somehow.

My second takeaway: there seemed to be real denial there that Trump would, or perhaps America would, do anything the supporter disagreed with.  He would say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that that happened‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs something Democrats would do.‚Äù  Now honestly he didn‚Äôt seem interested in seeking out facts; it was like he somehow couldn‚Äôt handle the idea of cruelty and dishonesty from the administration.  Examples of things he disagreed with: denying water to Colombian refugees on deportation flights, Trump Jr‚Äôs visit to Greenland for annexation propaganda, and giving executive orders that are blatantly unconstitutional and illegal.  

My third takeaway: the conversation was less about Trump and more that the supporter *wanted* to express his own views.  Similar to the first but not quite.  I let him do that.  This is old-fashioned, but a lot of his supporters are older.  

Fourth: he thought Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúweaponization of the justice system‚Äù that Bondi would fix *had* to be on his favorite issue, gun possession and sales.  He said that Biden‚Äôs position of revoking gun sale licenses for errors on documents was weaponization of the justice system.  When pressed he did admit that this is not done by the FBI but by the ‚ÄúATF‚Äù but still said it falls under what Bondi would fix.  I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is an accurate description of how the system works. 

How am I doing?  Suggestions for next time?  Ultimately I would like the denial to fade and the supporter to see that things he disagrees with *are* being done.  I know everyone has trouble with this, but how am I doing?",5,1739174381.0,AskALiberal,5,1.0,False

1im10r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1im10r8/no_contact_or_not/,No Contact Or Not..??,"Quick Summary:

GF broke up with me almost three months ago after six and a half years. We lived together for six of those. During that time she established a relationship with my son where I believe he truly viewed her as a step mother. I 100% believe she loves my son and would do anything for him.

Problem: 

Our relationship at times was strained due to my relationship with my ex wife / my son‚Äôs mother. Anyone in their right mind would never maintain a relationship with her but it‚Äôs not a consideration because it is what‚Äôs best for my son and what is legally obligated.

My ex girlfriend says she still cares for me but can no longer maintain a relationship with me because it has become to negative, anxiety provoking, and makes her feel like she doesn‚Äôt know who she is.

I agree that the relationship has become highly strained. I have admitted my faults and have taken serious steps to account for my part in the failures. In short, I don‚Äôt feel she has equally taken account for her part. I even admit, her part is less than mine but there still has been no accountability.

Over the last three months I have tried to work with my ex girlfriend to reset the relationship. Long story short, she hasn‚Äôt been able to move beyond just getting coffee and going for an occasional walk. With this, she still wants to maintain a relationship with my son all while indicating that she will most likely be moving two hours away in the not too distant future.

I have tried because I still feel the relationship can be fixed but I‚Äôm also trying to save my son‚Äôs relationship with her.  It is abundantly clear to me that if we can‚Äôt figure us out, I can‚Äôt facilitate the relationship between my son and her. This isn‚Äôt because I want to use my son as a weapon and to hurt her but I just can‚Äôt do it emotionally. I realize that my son should come first but I don‚Äôt feel I could relate to her at that level and still be the person my son needs me to be. 

Also, my ex girlfriend is now asking me to add more stress to my life in the form of stress that my ex wife did / does. Stress that strained our relationship. In short, I‚Äôd be stuck in the middle of two women facilitating their relationship with my son.

Through all of this, I have felt that my ex girlfriend hasn‚Äôt felt the full weight of her decision to end the relationship because I have been allowing her to have just enough access to keep her involved allowing her to move on at her own pace all while I feel the full weight of the breakup.

No contact:

This past week I finally reached my limit emotionally. I haven‚Äôt felt she‚Äôs moving towards any reconciliation and just wants to exist in this sort of middle ground. I told her I could not do it any longer and that she needed to move the rest of her stuff out of my house. I cut off any contact in every way shape or form you can think of. I feel I cannot move on with my life and come to terms with everything unless this happens. Again, I don‚Äôt think she has felt the full weight of her decision without cutting off contact.

The question:

Was she getting a free pass on not feeling the full weight of her decision without cutting off contact? Does anyone think that she may see things differently and now want to make a true, honest effort?

I believe it has to be no contact in order for me to move on. I‚Äôd be lying though if I also wasn‚Äôt hoping she comes to her senses. I really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to change her mind. I guess I‚Äôm just stuck in this whole mess of the breakup, my son‚Äôs well being, and all the confusing opinions and approaches to this mess that I‚Äôve found so far.

The sea was near.  
Breathing in steady waves, as if unable to decide whether to attack or retreat.  
It was like me‚Äîsomewhere between the storm and silence.  
The water tasted of salt, bitterness, and something unnameable. Like pain that dissolves but never disappears.

It was May in Ba≈°ka.  
The air was heavy, humid, saturated with the scent of the sea and pine trees.  
The smoke of palo santo rose into the air, as if trying to scatter the invisible bonds that tied us together.  

We sat in a circle. The light of the candles danced on the stone walls, and K. was lighting the wood. He looked at us, his eyes deep but impenetrable.  
And then he asked:  
""What would you do if you weren't afraid?""

The question was like a blow to the chest.  
Should I answer? Should I tell the truth?  
Should I admit that if I weren‚Äôt afraid, I‚Äôd tell him I wanted him?  
That I no longer wanted to play the game between ""maybe"" and ""never""?

But I said nothing.  
I just stared into the fire, quietly dissolving into the night.  
I was silent.  
And so was he.

---

Then there was M.  
M. wasn‚Äôt a question.  
M. was the answer.

I knelt before him. His body was firm, his skin hot beneath my hands.  
I took him slowly, deliberately, as if accepting something inevitable.  
This wasn‚Äôt anger.  
This wasn‚Äôt revenge.  
It was something else.  
It was the final breaking of the thread that tied me to K.  

Behind the wall, he must have listened.  
Every breath, every movement, every sign that I was letting him go.  
And I wanted him to hear.

‚ÄúCan you handle it?‚Äù M. asked.  
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I replied.

When he pulled me closer, his hands gripped my hips tightly.  
He was different from K.  
He didn‚Äôt ask. He didn‚Äôt hesitate.  
He took me as if I were a certainty, not a question.

---

The morning was different.  
The air was cleaner, the sea softer, calmer.  
Ba≈°ka smelled of lavender and salt, as it always did, but differently somehow.

He was there.  
K. His hands wrapped around a cup of coffee.  
He was silent.

And I no longer needed to wait for his words.  
I looked at my reflection in the glass.  
At a face that was calm, like the sea after a storm.  
At lips that no longer tasted bitter.  
At eyes that no longer wanted anything but to continue moving forward.

Later, we walked to the lighthouse.  
Red and white, lost in the mist that dissolved into rain.  
The path led along the coastline, through damp pines and jagged cliffs.  
Raindrops fell quietly, surrounding us as if trying to swallow all the unspoken words.

I wanted to walk faster.  
Maybe, if I walked fast enough, I could escape this story.  
Maybe I could leave K. in the mist, along with all the feelings I had carried with me.  

But K. caught up to me.  
He stopped beneath the lighthouse, where the rain slid down the rocks and the silence was almost tangible.  

He looked at me. His eyes were different now, but still distant.  

‚ÄúI know now what I‚Äôd do if I weren‚Äôt afraid,‚Äù he said.  

I looked at him.  
At his face, his hands hanging at his sides, as if they didn‚Äôt know what to do.  
I was silent. I didn‚Äôt ask what he meant.  
Because it no longer mattered.

I turned and walked away.  
The wind blew in from the sea.  
And his scent?  
It belonged only to me now.

1im0yeu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1im0yeu,Rate my Fake Espresso Martini,"Hey guys. If you have the ingredients, can you please try my specs for an Instant Espresso Martini?

1.5oz vodka
0.75oz Kahlua 
1.0oz instant espresso**
0.25oz simple syrup 

**For the espresso, I used Medaglia D‚ÄôOro espresso instant coffee powder. Serving size per the label is 1 teaspoon to 6oz hot water. For this application I used 1 teaspoon to 4oz hot water. I don‚Äôt think that was strong enough. Next time I will try 1:3. 

Wet shake, extra hard. Strain into chilled martini glass. Dust with a pinch of espresso powder. 

It tasted pretty good to me, but it was very strong of Kahlua flavor and less so of the espresso. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever ordered a proper espresso martini for myself before, so I don‚Äôt know exactly how to judge this one. At first sip I thought it might actually taste close enough to pass as an actual espresso martini. Visually, it certainly looks the part, especially after the foam settles a bit. But now that I think about it, it‚Äôs just a sweetened Black Russian. 

So I ask if you can please try out these specs and give some feedback. I would also like to ask if it is possible, to sub out the Kahlua for Mr Black or Borghetti. I don‚Äôt have either of those so I‚Äôm really interested to know if the Kahlua is working against me here. And also if the espresso concentration needs any adjusting.

1im0tf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1im0tf6/the_coffee_shop_stranger_who_changed_my_day/,The Coffee Shop Stranger Who Changed My Day,"So this happened about two months ago. I (26F) live in a mid-sized city in the Midwest, and I work a pretty standard office job. Nothing glamorous, but it pays the bills. Anyway, on this particular Thursday, everything was going wrong.

I woke up late, spilled coffee on my white blouse, and hit every red light on the way to work. By the time I sat down at my desk, my boss was already riding me about some spreadsheet I‚Äôd forgotten to update.

By lunch, I was completely over the day, so I decided to treat myself to my favorite coffee shop downtown. It‚Äôs this cozy place with mismatched chairs and the best vanilla lattes. I figured maybe some caffeine and a quiet corner would help me reset.

The line was long, but I didn‚Äôt care. I stood there, scrolling mindlessly on my phone, until I felt someone behind me shift uncomfortably. I turned around and saw this older guy, probably in his late 60s, wearing a well-worn plaid shirt and a ball cap.

He smiled politely, and I did that Midwestern thing where you smile back even if you're not in the mood to talk.

After a minute, he said, ‚ÄúYou seem like you‚Äôre carrying the weight of the world today.‚Äù

Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt entertain small talk, but there was something kind about his tone. I shrugged and said, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs just been one of those days.‚Äù

He nodded knowingly. ‚ÄúAh, I‚Äôve had plenty of those. But you know what my dad used to say? 'Even the worst days have sunsets.'‚Äù

I kind of laughed because it sounded cheesy, but it also hit me in a weird way.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI guess I needed to hear that.‚Äù

The line moved forward, and I ordered my latte. When I got to the register to pay, the barista smiled and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all set. The gentleman behind you covered it.‚Äù

I turned around, surprised, but the man just waved it off like it was nothing.

‚ÄúPay it forward someday,‚Äù he said with a wink.

Before I could even thank him properly, he grabbed his black coffee and walked out the door.

I sat by the window, sipping my free latte, and I realized my day didn‚Äôt feel so heavy anymore. That small act of kindness from a total stranger had completely flipped my mood.

I never saw him again, but I still think about that encounter. And yeah, I did pay it forward a week later by buying coffee for a young mom who looked like she was having a rough morning.

It‚Äôs funny how little moments like that stick with you. Sometimes, all it takes is a stranger's kindness to remind you that things aren‚Äôt so bad after all.

The itching is almost completely internal, as it is on the sphinctor and about one inch into the anus.  I'm not an anatomy expert but that's the best description I can give.  I will see a doctor soon but want more opinions.

This has been ongoing for up to 7 months, with periods of symptoms fading and returning.

I went from urgent care to a dermatologist to a Gastroenterologist with no end in sight.

From these visits, my current treatment plan is to take a sitz bath for 20 minutes with epsom salt, and then apply vaseline to the affected area afterward.  I also take metamucil around meal time.  Then before bed I apply triamcinolone so I can get through the night and I just take the brunt of the symptoms during the day.  Most days I can fall and stay asleep but recently the pain has been sharp and unrelenting.

Other than that, I recently had a sigmoidoscopy in which nothing was found.  Doctors generally don't think anything special on visual inspection either.

Now I want to detail the last 2-3 weeks.  I created a log and tracked consistency of bowel movements, food, when things hurt, and what I was doing to treat.  My symptoms went away slowly during a 2 week period, and were gone for 3-4 days.  Then last sunday the symptoms returned in nearly full force.  And now, I have been dealing with a constant 5-7/10 constantly throughout the entire day today.  I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but right now I want as many opinions as possible.

From my log I have the following information:  my bowel movements generally are smooth and easy to pass so I don't think thats a problem.  Last Saturday I had ice cream, and thats the only major dietary change the happened around re-emergence of symptoms.  I do have other dairy products in my coffee or lunch so not sure how much of an effect that has.

Most notably I took Pyrantel Pamoate at the beginning of the 3 week log, Tues Jan 14.  There is no reason to believe its pinworms but the medication is OTC and has mild side effects, and I absolutely will throw s\*\*\* at the wall to see what sticks.  Within a week and a half I stopped needing triamcinolone and pain was only intermittent during the day.  The symptoms died off slowly over the next week.  Symptoms came back around Sun Feb 2, which is near the 2 week mark and I didn't take a follow up dose.  Idk what to make of this because I haven't seen any pinworms, and I don't have any exposure to pets or children.  The symptoms took a while to start to really fade as well.

So to end the post: What test or medication should I ask for and what should I do?

I use triamcinolone .025 or .1% daily around night time.  How long can this go on?  There is absolutely no chance I get more than 3 hours of sleep without doing this.  I am not even sure the ointment I just applied will get me through the night.

1im0s93,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1im0s93/the_coffee_shop_stranger_who_changed_my_day/,The Coffee Shop Stranger Who Changed My Day,"So this happened about two months ago. I (26F) live in a mid-sized city in the Midwest, and I work a pretty standard office job. Nothing glamorous, but it pays the bills. Anyway, on this particular Thursday, everything was going wrong.

I woke up late, spilled coffee on my white blouse, and hit every red light on the way to work. By the time I sat down at my desk, my boss was already riding me about some spreadsheet I‚Äôd forgotten to update.

By lunch, I was completely over the day, so I decided to treat myself to my favorite coffee shop downtown. It‚Äôs this cozy place with mismatched chairs and the best vanilla lattes. I figured maybe some caffeine and a quiet corner would help me reset.

The line was long, but I didn‚Äôt care. I stood there, scrolling mindlessly on my phone, until I felt someone behind me shift uncomfortably. I turned around and saw this older guy, probably in his late 60s, wearing a well-worn plaid shirt and a ball cap.

He smiled politely, and I did that Midwestern thing where you smile back even if you're not in the mood to talk.

After a minute, he said, ‚ÄúYou seem like you‚Äôre carrying the weight of the world today.‚Äù

Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt entertain small talk, but there was something kind about his tone. I shrugged and said, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs just been one of those days.‚Äù

He nodded knowingly. ‚ÄúAh, I‚Äôve had plenty of those. But you know what my dad used to say? 'Even the worst days have sunsets.'‚Äù

I kind of laughed because it sounded cheesy, but it also hit me in a weird way.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI guess I needed to hear that.‚Äù

The line moved forward, and I ordered my latte. When I got to the register to pay, the barista smiled and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all set. The gentleman behind you covered it.‚Äù

I turned around, surprised, but the man just waved it off like it was nothing.

‚ÄúPay it forward someday,‚Äù he said with a wink.

Before I could even thank him properly, he grabbed his black coffee and walked out the door.

I sat by the window, sipping my free latte, and I realized my day didn‚Äôt feel so heavy anymore. That small act of kindness from a total stranger had completely flipped my mood.

I never saw him again, but I still think about that encounter. And yeah, I did pay it forward a week later by buying coffee for a young mom who looked like she was having a rough morning.

It‚Äôs funny how little moments like that stick with you. Sometimes, all it takes is a stranger's kindness to remind you that things aren‚Äôt so bad after all.

and the new wreckage of the world.

I stand before my routine reflection,
button up my sanity,
brush weary strands of hair with pomade
and seal cracked lips of distrust
with cocoa butter and matte rouge.

I ready myself once again
for morning and mortify.
Stacking poetry and bills in a knapsack;
I bundle up hope (it‚Äôs brutal out there).

For a moment, I stand with ghosts
and the framed ancestors surrounding me.
I call out, hoping she can hear me
over the day-breaking sirens‚Äî
hoping she‚Äôs not far away,
or right down the street,
praying over another dead black boy.

How will we make it through this, Ms. Brooks?

                     Hold On.

When she held a body,
she saw much worse than this.
I know she was earshot and fingertip close to oppression.
She saw how hateful hate could be.
She raised babies, taught Stone Rangers,
grew a natural and wrote around critics.

She won a Pulitzer in the dark.

She justified our kitchenette dreams,
and held on. 
She held on to all of us.

                    Hold On, she whispers. 

Another day, when I have to tip-toe
around the police and passive-aggressive emails
from people who sit only a few feet away from me.
Another day of fractured humans
who decide how I will live and die,
and I have to act like I like it
so I can keep a job;
be a team player, pay taxes on it;
I have to act like I‚Äôm happy to be
slammed, severed, and swindled.
Otherwise, I‚Äôm just part of the problem‚Äî
a rebel rouser and rude.

They want me to like it, or at least pretend,
so the pretty veils that blanket who we really are‚Äî
this complicated history, can stay pretty and veiled
like some desert belly dancer
who must be seen but not heard.

                     Hold On.

We are a world of lesions.
Human has become hindrance.
We must be stamped and have papers,
and still, it‚Äôs not enough.
Ignorance has become powerful.
The dice that rolls our futures is platinum
but hollow inside.

Did you see that, Ms. Brooks?
Do you see what we‚Äôve become?
They are skinning our histories,
deporting our roots,
detonating our very right to tell the truth.
We are one step closer to annihilation.

                    Hold On, she says, two million light years away.

She‚Äôs right.
Hold On everybody.
Hold On because the poets are still alive‚Äîand writing.
Hold On to the last of the disappearing bees
and that Great Barrier Reef.
Hold On to the one sitting next to you,
not masked behind some keyboard.
The one right next to you.
The ones who live and love right next to you.
Hold On to them.

And when we bury another grandmother,
or another black boy;
when we stand in front of a pipeline,
pour another glass of dirty drinking water
and put it on the dining room table,
next to the kreplach, bratwurst, tamales, collards, and dumplings 
that our foremothers and fathers‚Äîimmigrants,
brought with them so we all knew that we came from somewhere;
somewhere that mattered.
When we kneel on the rubbled mosques,
sit in massacred prayer circles,
Holding On is what gets us through.

We must remember who we are.
We are worth fighting for.
We‚Äôve seen beauty.
We‚Äôve birthed babies who‚Äôve only known a black President.
We‚Äôve tasted empathy and paid it forward.
We‚Äôve Go-Funded from wrong to right.
We‚Äôve marched and made love.
We haven‚Äôt forgotten‚Äîeven if they have‚ÄîKarma is keeping watch. 

Hold On.
Hold On everybody.

""Cops had been waiting outside the store as early as 9:00 a.m. But later on, it looked like they were everywhere; blocks deep in either direction, out in large numbers, standing on corners, hanging around in all shapes and sizes of police vehicles, walking up and down the block, circling in packs of bicycle units. Counter terrorism trucks were parked at 7th and Bainbridge and were positioned with more police cars on the same corner.

An attendee left the bookstore and was followed by two police officers into a coffee shop, who monitored their activity and tailed them for blocks. More and more cops showed up, lining the street while filming and photographing everyone who entered or left the shop.

Concerned at the large and hostile police presence, some people who wished to come to the talk, thought it better to leave. The police seemed to be about to do something. In fact, they already had. The day before, two police officers entered the Shoe and asked that they cancel the event. The police made nonsense claims that they feared the presence of antifascists would result in street conflict, and made accusations about Antifa‚Äôs involvement with recent protest actions.

We want to reiterate: Philadelphia Police tried to stop this event.

They were trying to shut down a free, open-to-the-public speaking engagement about antifascism with author and political scholar Matthew Lyons. Lyons went on anyway and spoke to a standing room only crowd regarding his most recent work, ‚ÄúCtrl-Alt-Delete: Antifascist Report on the Alternative Right.‚Äù So many people turned up for the talk we ran out of room, and those who could fit inside got to learn about the rising tide of alt-right ideology and fascist activity. We hope that the cops watching and filming us through the windows enjoyed the talk as well; they obviously have an intense interest in fascism.

This behavior should sound the alarm. The state is poised to crack down on communities simply based on political ideology. Radical spaces, groups and associations are being targeted. Philly Antifa and antifascists everywhere are being threatened. We will not accept a world in which it is possible to silence a public talk at a bookstore. We must work together now to resist this blatant repression.""

This was my second marathon, and overall it was an exhilarating experience.

**Pre-Race:**

I flew to Phoenix on Friday morning. The race expo had great vibes and was very well organized‚Äîwith clear signage everywhere. I picked up my bib in just five minutes and even attended a course analysis seminar led by a coach, which proved super helpful.

For dinner, I kept it simple: sushi, water, plain bagels, bananas, and a few other light items. Despite my preparations, I still had trouble falling asleep because of the timezone difference.

I set my alarm for 3:30‚ÄØa.m. The bus loading time for the marathon was scheduled between 4:00‚ÄØa.m. and 5:15‚ÄØa.m., and we were advised to be on the bus by 4:45‚ÄØa.m. Unsure of what traffic might be like, I built in an extra 20-minute buffer. Although I had a restless night and woke up several times, I managed to rise before the alarm went off. I fueled up with a small cup of coffee, one bagel, one banana, and a Honey Stinger energy waffle.

There were plenty of buses available, and our ride took about 30 minutes. I appreciated being able to stay on the bus during the two-hour wait‚Äîduring that time, I even managed to catch an extra hour of sleep after everyone disembarked.

I encountered long lines at the portable toilets, but I just made it in time to join the 3:25 pace group. After the national anthem and a burst of fireworks, we sprinted to the starting line.

**During the Race:**

* **Miles 1‚Äì4:** The race started with a smooth, downhill stretch. The atmosphere was buoyant, and I maintained a steady pace of 7:45 per mile while chatting with fellow runners.
* **Miles 5‚Äì6:** This section featured the only uphill portion of the course. Although the elevation gain was modest, I definitely felt the impact. In hindsight, I should have slowed down by 10‚Äì15 seconds per mile rather than trying to maintain the same pace.
* **Miles 7‚Äì12:** The course then transitioned to mostly downhill and flat terrain. The enthusiastic crowds, complete with funny signs, created a fantastic local atmosphere that I thoroughly enjoyed.
* **Miles 13‚Äì20:** I took some salt stick pills and was comfortably holding my pace. However, my calves began to spasm, forcing me to slow down and adjust my cadence several times.
* **Miles 22‚Äì24:** Luckily, the calf spasms subsided. When I glanced at my watch, I realized my personal record (PR) goal was at risk, so I started picking up the pace.
* **Miles 25‚ÄìFinish:** By this point, I was breathing heavily, my arms were swinging, and I was running on all cylinders. As soon as I saw the finishing line, I launched into a mad dash, crossing it with a time of **3:29:53**! 9 min PR ! I was ecstacic. 

**Post-Race:**

The post-race drink party was a blast, with plenty of beers and drinks to enjoy. After gathering my gear bag, I noticed many streets were still closed, so I ran back to my hotel at a very relaxed pace.

**Final Thoughts:**

My fueling and hydration strategy worked very well this time‚ÄîI took six gels, stopped at every aid station for Gatorade, and took salt stick pills twice. One area for improvement is incorporating more tempo runs into my training schedule. Also, losing 5 lbs of body fat definitly helped! ",3,1739171339.0,Marathon_Training,1,1.0,False

I am so lonely, I wonder if other people feel the same way I do. I want to do things I really do but a walk to my local cafe doesn't sound appealing to me. I could go out, I could enjoy the very sunny day now that has somehow appeared in the middle of september. Instead I stay in my room thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking. I feel like I have a million things to do but there is nothing I can do. I genuinely think if I had the choice I would still choose to stay alone in my bed but I don‚Äôt want that. I want to do things, I want to be able to go for a walk happily. I‚Äôd like for someone to be in my room with me telling me that I may just be enough, even though deep down I know that I'm not. I could probably make friends. Everyone in their 20‚Äôs is a bit lonely. I have my bestfriend and she means the world to me. I do worry that I am a bad friend as she is realistically my only friend I talk to here. I put all of my pressure onto her. She is genuinely one of the best people. She is so funny and so nice and honest with me. I am often inspired by her. She struggles too but never has a day alone she finds things to do. I‚Äôm trying less to put her on a pedestal as I also know this unknowingly puts pressure on her. She isn‚Äôt perfect, she has her own struggles, but she is so strong. 

I often feel like a bit of an alien, a victim complex constantly whispering in my ear. I used to think that no one liked me till an old counsellor told me that was a narcissistic way of thinking, perhaps it is. But now I don‚Äôt know anyone who can dislike me. I struggle with all these negative thoughts and feelings but it‚Äôs weird. I feel like I'm trapped in my own body. I don't really know what I am thinking or how I am feeling. Tomorrow I will know that today was a bad day. I stayed indoors all day and felt sorry for myself but today I just feel numb. I imagine getting my life together, what I would be like, someone that didn‚Äôt have to force themselves to get out of bed or to shower, someone that can leave the house at any time, not at half past or on the clock. Realistically I am just lazy, brains are hardwired to be that way, lazy. The reason I stay in my room all day is because I am lazy but god am I lonely. What‚Äôs the point of doing anything if you are doing them alone? I know they say to enjoy your own company and I guess i've had to growing up but I hate it. I hate my own company, I hate myself and I hate anything I do. One of the reasons I am so lazy I guess is because of this hatred, why should I do anything that benefits me? I can‚Äôt be bothered to eat well or learn to drive because I don‚Äôt deserve to, I can‚Äôt be bothered to go make friends because I don‚Äôt deserve them. Realistically  I am probably not a good friend. Yesterday I went to the gym with my bestfriend and it was honestly one of my favourite days doing something that was good for ME but also not alone, she had told me that I had been miserable and quiet recently. Worst thing is I don‚Äôt even realise I am. I don't know if I am anxious or sad until I'm having panic attacks or drinking alone at night trying to force myself to cry. But I still don‚Äôt cry. There's just this kind of disconnect between my body and brain. I know how I should be feeling in a moment but these past couple years I just don‚Äôt feel. I feel as if I am on a treadmill of life just watching it all pass me and I'm just looking down on myself watching it all go past. Right now I am waiting for my best friend to come home from work, it is 3pm and she has been there since 7 am awful shift and all I can think about is when she comes back I can do something. How selfish it is that she‚Äôs been busy all day and all I can think of is myself.  And i‚Äôve learned when i‚Äôm feeling this type of way I become resentful and its this ugly feeling that grows inside of me, as a woman too we are all meant to be eachothers competition for men, honestly I don‚Äôt even know if I like men. 


I say I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm feeling yet I‚Äôm able to type a whole page of weird feelings, imposter. To other people I know this probably looks like depression not wanting to get out of bed feeling numb but I genuinely don‚Äôt think it is, could be burn out but I don‚Äôt do anything. Reminds me of the great gatsby you know that guy that had everything but was still so miserable I could have things I could go outside and go get a coffee. I have a wonderful best friend and a dad that loves me in a funny way, two sisters and a brother and four nieces and two nephews, a godmother who I care about a lot and a mum who I haven‚Äôt quite figured our relationship out yet. 

I‚Äôve been feeling very dissociated at the moment, and I hate saying that because it sounds like a diagnosis. Usually I wouldn‚Äôt notice, because again I don‚Äôt really know how I'm feeling but my best friend let me know today that I‚Äôm sounding very surface level and uncomfortable and to be honest I am. The level of discomfort can‚Äôt be explained. I feel out of my own body at all times and its making me so boring. Saying the most random replies or mediocre stuff; its warm today isnt it. I bore myself, find myself thinking of what boring shit to say next. I just feel so awkward all of the time I wish I could be myself but I have no idea who that is. My memory is awful probably from the amount of drugs I did as a teen or the amount I drank I dont know but its so upsetting I can‚Äôt remember anything. 

I saw my ex at work on saturday I broke up with him because mid drunk arguement he raised his hands at me and I don‚Äôt ever want to be scared of a man I‚Äôm with but deep down I know he din‚Äôt mean anything by it. He‚Äôs the only person who loved me like that and he‚Äôs the only person who I love like that. I love my bestfriend so much but of course it‚Äôs different. I think about him all the time I begged for him to come back even though he probably wasn‚Äôt the best for me. Before we got together he said he didn‚Äôt wat a relationship straight away because he was worried abiut university changing him, the same uni I go to. But if you‚Äôre worried about becoming a bad person you‚Äôre probably not a bad person it was more likely just excuses so he could experience uni. Anyway sorry, I saw him at work mid pouring a pint and he asked me if we still accept this type of student discount card. I was shocked he spoke to me. I didn‚Äôt know if it was because he wanted to talk to me but didn‚Äôt know how. But looking back at it maybe he didn‚Äôt recognise me since being with him I dyed my hair red and posted lots because he watched my stories now again I am brunette. But it hurts so much if he didn‚Äôt recognise me I have thought about him so much for the last two years and when I asked to go for coffee he had let me know he was in a new relationship. But how can you not know who I am? He said I love you first and yet was speaking to another girl not long after ‚Äò ibroke his heart‚Äô I think maybe we view love in different ways. He saw it more as a time stamp on our relationship, you know three months dating time to say the words. In reality when he said I love you I was coming back from a panic attack in the bathroom quietly and during it I was just looking at him stunned. Love. Love. Love me? I stayed silent for about half an hour thinking about him,looking at him and I knew the feelings I had for him were also love. 

I feel so ugly and awkward, I wish I wasn't and I hate myself. I can not think of one thing I like about myself, infact I dislike everything about myself. I wish I was dead I wish I was never born. I just feel like the worst person and that no one likes me. Not in a dislike type of way just that they don't like me. Loneliness is literally the worst my friend told me yesterday that I down play my friendships but I really don't do that I don't think I just don't have many it's like if u don't make friends in first year you don't have friends at all. 

Hello me again it's a few months later. I‚Äôve just been out. I feel so ugly. Not even just feel when I go out with my best friend I'm always the Duff. I know it sounds so childish but I know I'm always the person that someone has to talk to while their friend talks to mine. I want to kill myself I really want to. At least I want to cut myself now more than ever. I am never going to have someone come up to me and try and talk to me. I wish I was dead. No one will approach me ever. I'm so pathetic but no one wants me.  

I feel so annoying I am always talking and saying the most dumb stuff I hate myself i genuinely want to die I want to die so bad

Me again, I hate myself so much I want to die all of the time. I don't know how I'd do it. I used to thing about over doing nbihr then someone would find mh body and then over dousing in the woods but then someone would find mh body or no one would seeecmy note . I just feel so disgusting and pathetic and I really want to kill mhseld but can't think of a way to do it without traumatising those around me, I am a bad friend and always look for the ways k am not . I genuinely think if I died without it hurting those around me everything would be better. I wish I didn't exists

Hello lovely human. Thanks for checking out my post. 

Let me start by saying I‚Äôm AFAB, she/her and present femme. I consider myself queer and somewhere on the aromantic and asexual spectrum. 

I do experience sexual attraction- but only sometimes. I am more likely to be attracted physically to women. In general I‚Äôm positive about it, enjoy spicy books etc. But in practice I‚Äôm more neutral about it. I can enjoy it, but have no emotional connection to it nor is it something I need or have a strong desire for very often. So 

Romantic attraction is a little more complicated. I don‚Äôt really experience it, and I sort of have a hard time ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù romantic feelings. Though if I get closer to someone I‚Äôm more inclined to be comfortable with romantic affection. 

I‚Äôve dated and been with both men and women in more ‚Äúconventional‚Äù relationships as well as had several unconventional connections. Though mostly I‚Äôve been single. 

But I‚Äôm at a point in  life where I‚Äôd like to find a long term partnership with ONE person, who accepts me as queer and on the AroAce spectrum. I desire companion and connection. I‚Äôm want someone to share life experiences with, travel with and have amazing conversations with. I‚Äôm open to cohabiting or that thing with rings but not set on either. However I very much would also like to find someone who would like 1-2 kids. 

Location and age (just be over 21) don‚Äôt really matter. I currently live in rural Colorado but am open to relocating for the right situation, or doing long distance too. 

Aesthetic attraction is important to me. No smokers, no hard drugs, no heavy drinkers. Wants kids, dog friendly. Personality, shared interests and values are important.

More about me- Gemini, INTJ, ADHD, very pragmatic, free spirited and independent. I value knowledge, curiosity and honesty. Travel is my biggest passion with 42 countries visited so far. I‚Äôm nerdy in a pop culture sort of way (MCU, HP, Star Wars) and I adore going to Disney theme parks. I‚Äôm into witchy things like tarot and crystals. I like to write, read and craft. I deal with some social anxiety, I hate small talk and settings where Im supposed to socialise with  people I ‚Äúsort of‚Äù know. Though being anonymous in a crowd doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. I like bookstores, coffee shops, museums or going to the movies. I rarely drink, dont smoke or do drugs. Technically Christian but not practicing. Politically left. I‚Äôm white, reddish hair, blue eyes, short and slim/average build.

So, there‚Äôs the gambit. I know there‚Äôs others out there like me. Just finding something so likeminded can be tricky! But here‚Äôs to hoping.

Let me know if its preposterous, reasonably accurate, or so so...   
\---

# Coffee Roasting Guide

# 1. Pre-Roast / Green Bean Selection

# Moisture Content

* Higher moisture content accelerates aging‚Äîprioritize for faster sale.
* Beans with more moisture take longer to reach First Crack (FC).
* Aim for weight loss of 2-3% above initial moisture content for optimal roasting balance.

# Altitude & Density

* **High Altitude / High Density:**¬†More sugar, acidity, and complexity.
* **Low Altitude / Low Density:**¬†More prone to tipping, requires gentler heat application.

# Hardness & Cultivated Variety

* Hardness correlates with density and roasting response.
* Different coffee varieties require unique roasting conditions.

# Processing Method

* **Natural Process:**¬†Shorter development time, lower temperature.
* **Washed Process:**¬†Longer development time, higher temperature.
* **Honey Process:**¬†Intermediate development time and temperature.

# 2. Pre-Heating Protocol

* **Pre-Heat Duration:**¬†45-60 minutes before the first roast.
* **Between Batch Protocols:**¬†2-5 minutes to stabilize system heat.
* **Ensure:**
   * Equilibrium of exhaust temperature (ET) and inlet air temperature.
   * Standard pre-heat settings are ready before starting.

# 3. Roasting Controls

# Heat & Airflow Management

* **Inlet temperature sensor:**¬†Rises as ET increases.
* **Bean Drop Impact:**¬†ET drops while inlet temp rises, requiring careful adjustments.
* **Fan Influence:**
   * Lowering the fan increases heat retention.
   * Increasing the fan cools the roasting environment and stabilizes temperature swings.

# Roasting Development

* Uneven development (outer vs. inner) can cause grainy or grassy flavors.
* Properly executed, this can add complexity but may prolong off-gassing.
* More even roasts result in a balanced cup with the same outer color.

# 4. General Roasting Principles

# Roast Time Considerations

* There is no one ""correct"" roast duration‚Äîoptimal timing depends on the batch size, gas pressure, and machine capacity.
* The ratio of batch size to burner output dictates the reasonable range of roast times.

# Roast Color & Development

* The degree of roast is a business and personal decision; roast as light as your skill allows.
* Underdeveloped coffee lacks sweetness‚Äîif struggling with light roasts, slightly extend development.
* Avoid baking coffee by preventing drastic Rate of Rise (RoR) crashes.

# Smooth RoR Control

* Maintaining a¬†**smoothly declining RoR**¬†is crucial to reducing roast defects.
* Roasts with fluctuating or crashing RoRs often taste hollow and less sweet.
* Mastering smooth RoRs takes practice‚Äîadjust gas and airflow carefully to avoid flicks and crashes.

# Data Collection & Probes

* A¬†**3mm ungrounded probe**¬†in a well-placed location is ideal for accurate data logging.
* Roasters should use software like¬†**Cropster**¬†or¬†**Artisan**¬†to track and analyze roast curves.
* Ensure environmental temperature (ET) probes are properly positioned for accurate readings.

# Development Time Ratio (DTR)

* DTR is¬†**not**¬†a universal benchmark‚Äîuse it as a¬†**quality control**¬†tool rather than a roasting rule.
* Prioritize¬†**smooth RoRs**¬†over hitting specific DTR values.
* Always¬†**drop batches based on color and bean temperature**, not just DTR percentage.

# Adjusting Roast Dynamics

* **For Darker Roasts:**¬†Reduce RoR slope with incremental power reductions at key waypoints.
* **Managing First Crack Crash:**¬†Avoid overcutting power before First Crack‚Äîmaintain heat to prevent crashes.
* **Extending Maillard Phase:**¬†Increase charge temperature while lowering gas early to extend Maillard reaction and improve sweetness.

# Machine Selection Considerations

* No single machine is ideal for all roasters‚Äîselect based on¬†**roast style, budget, and serviceability**.
* High automation machines may benefit large-scale production, while manual drum roasters offer more control for small-batch roasting.

# Best Practices for Consistency

* Track every roast with¬†**detailed notes or data logging tools**.
* Maintain a¬†**consistent warm-up routine**¬†and tweak one variable at a time for optimal adjustments.
* Conduct¬†**blind cupping tests**¬†to assess roast success objectively.

# 5. Summary & Best Practices

* **Smooth RoRs**¬†are critical for balanced, sweet, and fully developed roasts.
* Adjust¬†**gas, airflow, and charge temp**¬†carefully to maintain control.
* Use¬†**data collection tools**¬†to track roast progress and improve consistency.
* Avoid relying on¬†**DTR as a fixed rule**‚Äîroast color and bean temperature should dictate drop points.
* **Choose a machine based on roast style and operational needs**, not brand reputation alone.
* Keep experimenting and refining techniques‚Äîroasting is an ongoing learning process.

This guide consolidates fundamental roasting principles, emphasizing smooth RoRs, consistent data tracking, and adaptable techniques to achieve better coffee profiles.",1,1739171074.0,roasting,2,0.67,False

At my heaviest, wasnt really caring about diet, would have snacks, treats, etc. Wouldnt know the calories per day, but it wouldnt shock me if I averaged 3000 (eating a whole block of chocolate wouldnt be out of the ordinary).

Decided about 5 months ago to get down to at least double digits.

I used the eatthismuch website got a meal plan for the least calories I figured I could manage.
I now aim for 1600 calories a day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* My breakfasts consist of
1 x Pancake (1 egg, little oil, sale, water and protein powder)
1 x slice of cinnamon toast (wholemeal bread, bit of butter, sugar, cinnamon)
300 calories

* Lunch is
1 x Protein Shake (2 cups almond milk, protein powder, sweetender, creatine, little bit of cream and sugar free maple syrup)
300 calories

* Dinner
Pork (200g) and mixed vegies (400g)
400 calories

* I have 3 snacks
2 x Greek Yoghurt with an apple
1 x small bowl of granola
About 150 calories each.

Ive rounded the numbers, but it all adds up to just under 1600.
This puts me on approx
140g cards
45g fat
160g protein.
Should be decent on Iron and Vitamins and stuff.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Most days though, I skip all the snacks, as by the time I start to get hungry, its close to a meal.
Some days ill even skip a meal as I just dont really feel hungry all that often.
Add in a coffee or two (and the little bits of scraps I might get while cleaning up after my kids, im probably closer on average to 1200 to 1400 calories.

Ive been working out in my home gym as well.
Alternating every day between some weight training and boxing cardio. Maybe 15-20 min sessions while im preparing dinner.
Not extreme or difficult workouts, but enough to work up a bit of a sweat.

**Im not losing weight.**
Im at a large deficit, im excercising, im 'eating good food'... I really dont understand.

Am I just not eating enough food to lose weight?
If I understand the research ive done though, Basically, my body needs a certain amount of calories to function properly, and without them, it 'shuts down' among other things, the 'fat burner'.

Uneducated logic would tell me to 'eat less', but apparently this is a mistake.


My wife is in the same boat, she is heavier and shorter than I am, so has even more to lose, and has put herself on a 1200 calories meal plan, but she too is barely moving any weight after her initial 10kg (which I assume might have just been water weight or something) however she doesnt do any excercise.

That if two people truly cared for each other, they‚Äôd figure it out. After 10 years of marriage and a divorce I never saw coming, I now know how painfully naive that was. The love was real, but it wasn‚Äôt enough.

The first time I realized we were in trouble wasn‚Äôt during a big fight. It was on a random Tuesday, sitting across from each other at dinner, and realizing we had nothing to say. Silence, once comfortable, now felt like a void. The little things‚Äîlike him bringing me coffee in the mornings‚Äîhad stopped. Resentment quietly replaced gratitude. I felt alone even when we were together. And by the time we acknowledged it, we were already too far gone.

After the divorce, I spiraled. Therapy and working with a relationship coach pulled me out of it. And let me tell you‚Äîthere‚Äôs so much no one warns you about when it comes to love, commitment, and keeping a relationship from dying in slow motion. Here‚Äôs what I wish I knew before it was too late:

* **Your nervous system decides who you love‚Äînot your logic.** Ever wonder why you're drawn to certain people even when they‚Äôre bad for you? That‚Äôs not compatibility, it‚Äôs familiarity. If you grew up with instability, your body might mistake anxiety for passion. Safe love can feel ‚Äúboring‚Äù at first, but it‚Äôs the kind that lasts.
* **Emotional bids are everything.** Every time your partner reaches out‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a joke, a comment, or a random story‚Äîthey‚Äôre making an emotional bid for connection. Ignoring these (even accidentally) erodes intimacy over time. Dr. John Gottman found that couples who ""turn toward"" each other‚Äôs bids 86% of the time stay together. The ones who don‚Äôt? Divorce.
* **You‚Äôre not fighting about the dishes.** Arguments are rarely about what they seem. That fight about dirty plates? It‚Äôs about feeling unappreciated. That argument about texting back late? It‚Äôs about feeling unimportant. Dig deeper before you react.

Books were my saving grace post-divorce. My coach had me read so much that I swear I could get an honorary psychology degree. These five changed my entire perspective on love:

¬†**- ""**[***The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work***](https://befreed.ai/book/the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work-by-john-m-gottman)**"" by John Gottman** \- Written by Dr. John Gottman, one of the most respected relationship researchers in the world and the founder of the Gottman Institute. He can predict divorce with 90% accuracy based on how couples argue. If you want to understand what makes love last, read this.

¬†**- ""**[***Nonviolent Communication***](https://befreed.ai/book/nonviolent-communication-by-marshall-b-rosenberg)**"" by Marshall Rosenberg** \- Turns out, most of us were never taught how to express our needs without blaming or attacking. This book is a game-changer.

¬†**- ""**[***How to Do the Work***](https://befreed.ai/book/how-to-do-the-work-by-nicole-lepera)**"" by Dr. Nicole LePera** \- If you want to heal childhood wounds that are messing up your relationships, this is a must-read.

¬†**- ""**[***The Mastery of Love***](https://befreed.ai/book/the-mastery-of-love-by-don-miguel-ruiz-with-janet-mills)**"" by Don Miguel Ruiz** \- A spiritual and psychological deep dive, it‚Äôs one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read on breaking free from fear-based relationships. A must-read for anyone looking to cultivate real, unconditional love.

¬†**- ""*****Attached*****"" by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller** \- The #1 bestseller in relationship psychology. If you‚Äôve ever wondered why you fall into the same relationship cycles, this book will blow your mind.¬†

I used to think love was about grand gestures. Now I know it‚Äôs built in the tiny, ordinary moments‚Äîresponding to a text, asking how their day was, choosing patience over sarcasm. If I had truly understood this earlier, maybe things would‚Äôve turned out differently.

If you‚Äôve been in a long-term relationship or marriage, what‚Äôs one lesson you learned the hard way?

Found a small brown pile in the corner of a room window frame made of wood(somewhat like fine ground coffee), and I suspect it might be either carpenter ants or termites.

went on 2 dates (Coffee first meet > Bowling 2nd), smiles and laughing, all good both times. I paid for both, we met at the location. roughly 1-3 hours for both dates. Next day after 2nd date; No spark and we parted ways. What happened? It seemed like it was going great.

Now i'm not complaining about the rejection, it stung (but when doesn't it?); I took it on the chin and we parted ways as friends. I personally would've preferred another go at it since this was from an online site and 5-6 hours in person i dont think is enough to get to know someone. I'm not going to push the issue or anything I'm genuinely curious as i'm used to being ghosted before the date (if it gets that far) so actually having an acceptance AND it happening is a first for me as i haven't been in a relationship since i was 19 (i dont do hookups either). I'll skip on the nitty gritty (unless that's necessary)

1im04me,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1im04me/dad_who_was_generally_unpleasant_and_abandonment/,Dad who was generally unpleasant and abandonment issues ....,"This is a really fucking long one .

So , I (19f) grew up with a dad who yells a lot . But here's the catch - it wasn't usually at me , I was a careful kid , I made sure I didn't ever put a toe out of line in front of him , it was usually my poor brother who got yelled at all the time . 

But nonetheless I was always scared because he yelled a lot . At family , at colleagues , at employees , etc . When I was 14 he started working from home and he was always on the phone yelling . Sometimes I would wake up to my ceiling fan shaking because my dad was screaming his lungs out over the phone at nine in the morning . And I knew that none of it was directed towards me but I also knew that any day , at the slightest misstep , I could be the target of those screams . And I was , once or twice , once was because he overheard an argument between me and my narcissistic mother and called me a 'nothing , who is never going to amount to anything because she can't respect anyone' . Another time was because he was in a bad mood and I forgot to put aside a cup of coffee for him when I made my own early morning coffee . Similar insults again .

And it hurt because I knew it was intentional . My dad knows about my issues with self esteem and he knew what he said would hurt me . 

Maybe I could learn to not be afraid of him anymore but I can't because he's never been a good dad . He's a 'bank account father' - only acknowledges his wife and daughter when he's giving them money to spend , never bothers to talk to them or understand them . Add to that the fact that he's always put his own family above me or my mum . 

When I was a kid , around 7 or 8 , his brother got into some legal troubles and tried to evade the authorities . My parents moved to a different city with him and helped him get cleared of those charges ,  completely forgetting the fact that they had two kids under ten at home . My brother and I were abandoned on my aunt's doorstep without explanation and I hated my parents for so long because of it . Even after that case my dad always prioritised his brother . When my uncle came over my brother or I weren't allowed to talk I public in a way uncle could hear . I was expected to make tea and refreshments and basically appear subservient. 

And every time my uncle pissed him off he would take that anger out on his family . When my uncle messed up again and got himself into more trouble , dad would yell at my mom or my brother to feel better . And my mom never allowed me to say anything back because 'yelling is dad's coping mechanism'.

And this year my uncle found himself in yet another round of legal troubles , facing prison time , and my dad as been insufferable . He's been shouting at me and everyone else , at all hours of the day . I'm so scared . I've never been so scared . I'm not a kid anymore and he won't hesitate to be violent or verbally abusive now that I'm an adult . I can't move out right now and I've had so many panic attacks in just a few days . I can't do this anymore .

The beginning of our relationship was amazing.
I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and googling to understand and I definitely feel like there was some love-bombing in the beginning and neither of us are entirely whole-person healthy. 

One thing I want to do is say a little about me. I most definitely have some attachment issues - From what I‚Äôve researched and really dug into, preoccupied anxious attachment fits. I also have some codependency and tend to caretake and rescue. I absolutely have a history of relationships with individuals who have exploited my loving nature and willingness to help others which ultimately is my demise and SO unhealthy when I don‚Äôt apply appropriate boundaries. Honestly when I look back on my life it really feels like it depends on the person the level of boundaries I am able to enforce. 

Someone asked me recently ‚Äúwhat happened to you when you were younger that led you to believe that you deserve less than?‚Äù Honesty is the only thing that will truly set you free: not having a father and having a teenage mother affected me. My grandmother primarily raised me and while her love is the best and purest love I know, the scars that absent or inconsistent parents bring, can affect you longer than you realize. 
Ok‚Ä¶ I just wish that people on here would talk about their own mess too when they speak on their partners mess. So there you go, a little peak into my validation seeking, low boundary self. 

I just told my husband I want a divorce. I don‚Äôt want to keep doing this. Maybe my head is fucked up but when I really think about it all, the idea of going through any of this shit again just makes me want to cut all ties. Even when we talk and see each other now it‚Äôs not good. (We are in a separated situation rn but he is seeking to come home) He‚Äôs mean. He has terrible cognitive distortions and allows these distortions to rule his perception of the world so his thinking is not based on rationality or reality. Some of our negative interaction currently is me because I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôve put so much into the relationship that I‚Äôm exhausted and I‚Äôm just not able to apply the same effort, energy, and love as I used to. Really I think I‚Äôve started putting me first a little bit. 

Here is like the longest list of things that I‚Äôve put together over the last year that I‚Äôve been trying to decide whether or not to get a divorce. I know the fact that I‚Äôm even debating it and researching or asking other‚Äôs thoughts should be my answer but I always have hope for people and that hope that he can change and be the man I loved in the beginning, that absolutely keeps me, and the breadcrumbs of manipulative love he feeds me in between bouts of anger, hostility, and aggression. And the guilt trips he lays on me. Also I will tell myself that maybe it will get better when xyz happens. So I keep holding on, and my final ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù is when he would come home. That‚Äôs been my last, maybe it will get better when he gets home. 

I guess I‚Äôm asking what you would say if I was your friend in this situation or what you would need to hear right now if you were me. Or what helped you if you ever were in a situation like this. 
Thank you!
(The tense and how all this is worded may sound off because it was wrote over the course of a year, it‚Äôs kinda like free wrote journal entries and‚Ä¶ cuz‚Ä¶ emotions!)

Anyways here‚Äôs my list‚Ä¶

-You told me you will kill me. On multiple occasions 

-Saying you will kill my family 

-Saying you will kill my dog

-You told me you wouldn‚Äôt actually hurt me you just threaten and the fear of being hurt is enough that you don‚Äôt have to put your hands on me 

-Saying that my dog is yours

-Saying that any of my dogs have been yours when I am the one who have taken care of all of them

-You strangled one of our dogs lifting it into the air because it was scared to get its nails clipped

-Making me feel bad for choosing me over you and the dogs when you made me feel unsafe and I felt I needed to go to the police

-Placing your warped perception on the words I say to fit whatever theory you have in your head. 

-I hate that I am reactive asf to you. That I am no longer able to manage and control my anger and I blow up. That is not me. Name calling and yelling is not who I want to be and I hate that I allow you to get me there. 

-I cannot stand that you just can‚Äôt stop accusing me of cheating. That is rude and disrespectful to me. It makes me so mad to constantly be falsely accused. Insecurity is not the same as whatever this is. 

-Lying to me about your phones

-You say you care and you will ask about my day and I will be in the middle of a story and you will either cut me off or tell me you are getting off the phone, etc. You really don‚Äôt care what I have to say but play the part so I continue to do for you. 

-Since I don‚Äôt feel heard and you think poorly of my job then I don‚Äôt really feel like I have anything to talk about. So you tell me I‚Äôm bland and boring. I‚Äôm actually not at all it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt feel like you care and I don‚Äôt feel like talking to you is safe because you twist my words to fit some delusion and then a fight starts. 

-Having zero maturity and not respecting our budget limits. Just expecting whatever you want and taking advantage of my love and kindness placing me in a constant state of stress and anger

-Having the audacity to expect me to do more for you than you are willing to do for me and when I begin drawing lines in the sand you become offended

-Spending over half of my settlement money and not giving a single fuck about it

-Insinuating that you will give me anything less than your best because you have always been given whatever you wanted

-You told me you would throw oatmeal at me cuz it was too hot

-You called me a fat lazy bitch multiple times because after working all day I didn‚Äôt come home and then also clean. But you weren‚Äôt working. 

-You would take my car and leave me at home for days at a time only calling for me to send money. I would have to have coworkers take me to and from work, to the store and to get cigarettes. 

-On the same note you wouldn‚Äôt come home for days but accuse me of cheating. Like where are you?

-I remember once calling an Uber and paying $20 because you fell asleep in the car too fucked up when you knew I needed my car for work. 

-I remember asking what was on the inside of the car door and apparently it was one of your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù vomit from the night before that you ‚Äúmust‚Äôve missed that spot‚Äù

-I remember you asking me to legitimately traffic in you some dumbass tobacco to prison and then when I wouldn‚Äôt you were upset. Like really? That‚Äôs my freedom. 

-You literally just told me not to come see you and then got mad that I didn‚Äôt. 

-You called me a fucking whore when I‚Äôm scheduled till 5pm and wasn‚Äôt leaving yet at 458pm

-You put your hand around my neck as to strangle me because I didn‚Äôt help you carry stuff from your truck to the car and still to this day you tell me ‚ÄúI stopped myself‚Äù ‚ÄúI would never actually hurt you‚Äù

-You had me following you and then started acting crazy and telling me you would kill me and started throwing things from the truck into my car

-You sent me money so we could move out of where we were then wanted it back. I wanted us to move out SO BAD and didn‚Äôt want to send it. You told me you would kill me and my family if I didn‚Äôt send it. You also told me if I didn‚Äôt go pick you up from the gas station you were stuck at that you would beat my ass. I didn‚Äôt pick you up because I was terrified of you. 

-You told me you would put your hands on me if I didn‚Äôt shut tf up in my parents basement 

-you told me you were going to have some female give you head (supposedly you didn‚Äôt)

-The next night you answered the phone in front of me all ‚Äúhey baby thanks for the head, you‚Äôre so great, I‚Äôll see you soon‚Äù then threw pizza at me in the car and told me if I didn‚Äôt go get you money from the atm you would bash my face into the steering wheel

-At a motel you stood in front of the door and told me you were going to kill me and my family because I didn‚Äôt want you leaving with my car. I was scared for my safety because you were threatening to hurt me like you had the night before. The dogs were backed up near me acting as if they needed to protect me. You told me that if I didn‚Äôt go get a key for the room made for you then you would hit me and kill my family. 

-since you have been locked up you have threatened my safety by saying you would hurt me, kill me, take my dog, kill my dog, kill my family. 

-You constantly bring up the fact that I slept with someone the week before I met you which is irrelevant. I didn‚Äôt even know you then. 

-You call me names like whore, slut, slow, dumb bitch. 

-You told me I was slow and stupid because I didn‚Äôt pack up your belongings how you would‚Äôve. 

-You constantly put me down and pick apart everything I do especially if you would have done it differently. 

-You constantly accuse me of cheating 

-Any noise you hear in the background you turn it into I must be cheating 

-You call me a whore because of where I work and tell me that I work there for the attention 

-I couldn‚Äôt possibly ever have fun in my entire life because then I would never hear the end of it from you and be made to feel bad about it

-It appears that you don‚Äôt want me around my family OR yours OR to have any friends BUT you are allowed to do whatever you want always

-You are controlling 

-You can look through my phone but not me though yours

-You time how long I take to do things and if you feel like it took me too long to go grocery shopping then I must be cheating

-You don‚Äôt want me to have any social media unless it‚Äôs your account too

-You hide your relationships with women and can do whatever you want but expect me to cut everyone off. And god forbid if you hear a male voice in the background if I‚Äôm out in the world cuz then I‚Äôm automatically cheating 

-I have ‚Äúchanged‚Äù which is absolutely true and idk how I could ever go back to the woman I was when we first got together now because that woman was offered love and kindness and respect not this angry man that I don‚Äôt ever know what mood you will be in that moment. 

-When I told you my best friend died you didn‚Äôt console me. Still pretty much act like you don‚Äôt care at all. 

-This entire time it just feels like when I require my needs met then I need to meet them and when you need your needs met we both need to meet them

-You play mind games. Like say what you mean. I will ask you something like do you want me to pick you up or do you want a Lyft? You will tell me a Lyft. I will ask again to clarify then later you punish me and are mad at me that I get you a Lyft. I‚Äôm done trying to guess what you want because in the past if I would show up to surprise you then you also might be mad because you said you wanted a Lyft. There‚Äôs no making you happy. 

-You use prison, addiction, your mom, trauma, ANYTHING as an excuse to treat me poorly. 

-I have repeatedly mentioned to you that your tone matters. What you say and how you say it to me matters and you don‚Äôt care.

-you cannot expect me to accept your disrespect and then not be willing to eat that same shit. 

-Yesterday when I took your items to you, you were yelling and being disrespectful to me on the phone, so I was doing the same back and you told me that you were going to smash my face in because you thought I was around people outside. It‚Äôs like your appearance of being this great man and having a great relationship matters even though behind closed doors it‚Äôs a lie. 

-I told you tonight 11/26/24 that you make me not want to be alive, like I literally get to the point in our never ending arguing that I feel hopeless and hate life and you told me to take a knife and slit my throat -when I asked if you knew what you would get if I actually committed suicide after you encouraged it, you said insurance $, which would be true but you would have a better chance at receiving a prison sentence for assisted manslaughter. 

-You tell me that it doesn‚Äôt matter if I leave that you have women lined up and it wouldn‚Äôt bother you. 

-If I don‚Äôt want to do something for you then you try manipulating me by telling me that you‚Äôll just find another bitch to do it for you because there are plenty of females that would take my place. 

-You track my location but turn yours off. I live in the country so the accuracy isn‚Äôt as good as when in a bigger city so I will get calls and FaceTimes while sleeping to make sure I‚Äôm actually at home since I‚Äôm a whore (according to you) and I‚Äôm obviously cheating because find my iPhone isn‚Äôt as great where I‚Äôm at (which you know)

-I remember this one time you had this new job and you asked me to help remind you to get up and all that. I got you up, got your clothes for you, coffee, packed a lunch for you. Then as you left out the door you looked at me and said you weren‚Äôt going and left. And laughed in my face. 

-I second guess the fuck out of myself now. Like I remember I started to gather the trash one day and then I stopped and literally put everything back because I was afraid you would come home and accuse me of trying to hide evidence of cheating. 

-I scheduled a phone call between you and your lawyer. When you called your lawyer he didn‚Äôt answer. So you called me and took your anger out on me and told me not to ever do anything for you again that I can‚Äôt do things right and that you won‚Äôt be calling me ever again. You called right back and I answered again. As I answered I said I was in a meeting with my boss (I was) and you told me I cared more about my job than you - that‚Äôs not true, but I did not have time to be talked down to when I had done nothing wrong. My boss overheard some of the conversation since you were yelling at me from the jump both times (she‚Äôs a therapist of course, right?! lol) and asked me if I had a safety plan. 

-I went to try and get your glasses cut into your new frames and the place wouldn‚Äôt do it without the prescription of the glasses and you ripped all the way into me telling me I couldn‚Äôt do anything right and that you will never ask me to do anything for you again because I fuck everything up because I‚Äôm slow and don‚Äôt know how to talk to people. So I picked you up and we both went back and you were told the exact same thing‚Ä¶

-I took you to your eye doctor appointment and when you got in the car you wanted to smoke, fine, but you didn‚Äôt want to open your window because you didn‚Äôt want to get cold. You got aggressively angry. It was just a tantrum for nothing when you could‚Äôve just opened your window some. I just don‚Äôt understand it and then not say all the dumb comments of ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs your car, I just won‚Äôt smoke, I have to respect you‚Äù it‚Äôs just nonsense! Then I literally had to stop you from buying glasses that day because you had other bills being withdrawn. You were SO MAD. I offered alternatives which you wanted nothing to do with. We went to get quarters and weren‚Äôt able to get any so you took the $10 you had put aside for laundry and then put it in a lotto machine (won nothing) because you were angry you couldn‚Äôt get quarters. The level of anger and irrational choices that follow your anger are immeasurable. 

-You tell me you say hurtful things when you‚Äôre mad but you don‚Äôt mean them. That actually doesn‚Äôt excuse the words you say. You are still accountable for what you do and what you say regardless of your emotions. 

-You have told me that you are diagnosed Bipolar, which I could very well see that in your actions and behaviors. You have told me you need medication but I have no trust that you would stay on a medication. You were prescribed medication when we got together and you stopped taking it. I asked you to see Mental Health about a year in, you did, and were prescribed meds and stopped going and stopped taking those too. Having a mental health condition does not exonerate you from fault. I have my own mental health issues and try working through them. 

-I very much used to just let you do whatever and go along with it but for awhile I have begun voicing my anger and my concerns and you do not like it. Sometimes I am being reactive and I come off so angry and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm the problem and then when I voice my concerns to you they never get talked about you tell me you feel attacked. But like how am I attacking you when I tell you things that are bothering me that I would like us to work on. Example: ‚Äúhey baby when I do something and then you tell me what I should have done differently because my way was wrong or inefficient then it makes me feel really negative about myself and like I can‚Äôt do things correctly in your eyes‚Äù that is met with you being angry and saying I‚Äôm attacking you as a person and I‚Äôm just trying to make you feel low and less than when I am literally trying to tell you how you make me feel like I am garbage and how I would like us to work on our communication. It‚Äôs not a personal attack bro. 

-Over the last 3.5 years you‚Äôve told me on multiple occasions that you didn‚Äôt want to marry me. That you kept pushing it off and you wished you could change it. 

-You SO MANY times have told me we are over, that you are single, and you want a divorce. All of this is in manipulation in order to get me to do something for you or to gain back control of my emotions. I for the longest time have begged for us to stay together saying that marriage takes work and you don‚Äôt give up on the person you love etc. This is like emotional manipulation to keep coercive control over me. 

-In the last 6 months or so when you say divorce I tell you to do it. I am not trying to manipulate you I legitimately am like that‚Äôs cool, man, let‚Äôs get a divorce. I actually filled out paperwork and have been ready to go file for the last month. My biggest problem is that I give myself too much time and it‚Äôs like you know and give me little breadcrumbs of love. It‚Äôs terrifyingly exhausting and I want free of the cycle. Every moment of every day I wish you were the man you were when we first got together and I wish I could be that soft version of myself with you that I was back then too. Instead, I am forever questioning what your mood will be today and how to navigate with the least mental and emotional consequences.

Struggling to hear conversations clearly can be frustrating. Whether it's missing half of what‚Äôs said at a family dinner or nodding along to avoid asking, ""Sorry, what?"" for the third time, hearing difficulties affect daily life.

Hearing loss can also **impact memory and focus**, leading to mental fatigue and stress. [Whispeara](https://theworldhealth.org/whispeara-official) is a supplement claiming to **support auditory function and cognitive clarity**. But does it work, or is it just another bottle of false hope?

After **researching ingredients, reading user reviews**, and testing it (with a little help from my dad‚Äôs bowling buddy, Thom), I‚Äôve put together everything you need to know.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **Whispeara**
* **Category:** **Brain Health & Hearing**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.7/5**

# How Whispeara Works

This supplement goes beyond **basic ear health supplements** by combining **brain-boosting and circulation-supporting ingredients** to target **hearing clarity** and **cognitive function**.

It contains **Alpha-GPC, GABA, and L-Dopa Bean**, all known for their roles in **memory, neurotransmitter support, and relaxation**. This blend helps the brain process sounds more efficiently.

Then there‚Äôs **L-Arginine and L-Tyrosine**, which **improve blood flow** to the inner ear. Since poor circulation can contribute to hearing problems, this helps ensure **natural ear function support**.

Rather than just covering up symptoms, **Whispeara hearing support** aims to work from within, **enhancing neural pathways** linked to sound processing and **brain health and hearing**.

# Personal Experience with Whispeara (Thom‚Äôs Perspective)

Thom, my dad‚Äôs longtime bowling buddy, is the kind of guy who swears by black coffee, still uses a flip phone, and has a very particular way of lacing up his bowling shoes.

He also happens to have **struggled with hearing clarity for years**‚Äîclaiming that every conversation at the lanes sounded like a mumbling contest.

When he first [heard about Whispeara](https://theworldhealth.org/whispeara-official), he was skeptical. ‚ÄúAnother one of those snake oil pills?‚Äù he grumbled. But after some coaxing (and the promise that he could still drink his coffee while taking it), he agreed to give it a shot.

The first two weeks? Nothing dramatic. But by week three, Thom started noticing **less strain when following conversations**, even with the usual background noise at the bowling alley.

He wasn‚Äôt constantly asking, ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù‚Äîwhich, trust me, was a miracle in itself. He also mentioned that his **head felt clearer**, like a fog had lifted.

His only complaint? ‚ÄúWhy does something that actually works have to cost so much?‚Äù Classic Thom. Still, given the choice between **better hearing and saving a few bucks**, he‚Äôs sticking with it. ‚ÄúAt least now, I can hear the trash talk when I bowl a strike,‚Äù he said with a grin.

# Effectiveness & Expected Results

For those expecting instant results, let‚Äôs keep expectations in check. **Hearing enhancement supplements** take time, and **Whispeara** is no different.

# What Users Report Over Time

* **Weeks 1-2** ‚Äì Some feel **mental clarity improve**, but hearing changes are subtle.
* **Weeks 3-4** ‚Äì Speech in noisy environments becomes easier to follow.
* **Weeks 5-8+** ‚Äì Many notice **better overall hearing sharpness** and **reduced ear fatigue**.

**Natural tinnitus relief** is also reported by some, especially in those sensitive to **ringing in the ears**. While it won‚Äôt cure hearing loss, it does help **improve auditory function naturally**.

# Pros & Cons

# ‚úÖ Pros

1ilzv16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ilzv16/yearning_for_rejection/,"yearning, for rejection","Honestly, I don't really have a lot of friends, the one friend I talk to consistently doesn't really care. For context, I'm in my twenties, working at a company. There's this girl who *was* working there at the same time. The first time I saw her I thought she was cute- but I just played it cool and just avoided her. It made sense, I didn't want to catch feelings, but we wouldn't be here if I didn't. No crush of mine has ever liked me back (fair), hell, I'm not really an attractive guy to begin with (or in shape at the moment) so I get it. 



Anyways, a few weeks pass, and we end up talking and she's pretty cool- fun conversations and banter here and there. I can slowly feel myself slipping, but I didn't take any more precautions to stop it. Stupid of me, but I didn't want to stop it, she has the most beautiful smile- the one that makes you feel like you witnessed a miracle if you could see it appear on her face, her dark brown eyes have such warmth, that makes you feel the heat of thousand suns on your skin, Her voice, which makes any auditory masterwork sound amateur. She's the most beautiful song of a person, a living, breathing masterpiece only Michaelangelo could dream of making. She made me realize how beautiful beauty is, incarnate. I can literally feel my eyes dilate when I see her as, if I were trying to take in as much of her as possible into myself.

  
But I know, I'm just another person to her. She's a social butterfly, I'm just another person she happens to be around, but to me, she's everything. Harsh truths. A month ago, she left our workplace, and I thought that would be it- I can just chalk it up as it wouldn't have ever happened anyway, and I'll move on from it. Which I was, only really being held back by the occasional daydream. The idea of her was slowly coming to an end, and I was consistently working on myself. But for the second time, we wouldn't be here if she didn't come back.



I've been focusing on myself for a while- learning and creating the things I've wanted to make, but the news of her coming back came in like a wrecking ball into my life. I was tired that day, but when I heard the news, I couldn't believe my ears. It felt like I drank twelve coffees at once, had 24 hours of sleep, and had never been stressed in my life. I just felt like a kid again. Since then, she's the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last thing on my mind before I go to sleep. I never thought I would crush on a girl ever again. At some point, I lost that innocence, that naive idea of what love could be, but the idea of having her back in my life brought that back to me. From listening to cheesy love songs, or just thinking about her all day, she made me realize what I've always been looking for was that innocent, hand-holding, cuddly love. She draws this hopeless romantic out of me- cuddling with my pillow, imagining spending time together, holding hands, spending our life together, imagining her holding me, loving me like I want to love her. Somewhere along the way I just became a lonely, jaded, husk of a man. Being in this mania just makes me realize, I have so much love to give, I just don't know where to put it.



But the snap back to reality is just as strong as the euphoria. I seriously, cannot imagine her settling for a guy like me, she could have anyone in the world if she wanted to. I just feel so *less than* in comparison. Thinking about being with her makes my heart hurt so much- I just want to hold her hand and never let go.  Wanting someone this bad is painful I want someone to love me like I love her. Just once. I can't imagine that ever happening. I'm just a total mess of polarizing emotions, one side ready to give it my all, and the other absolutely depressed at the idea of this whole thing

  
I went out in nature to talk to myself- my crazy mood swings made me incapable of working on the stuff I wanted to. I came to the conclusion that I should give it the absolute best shot I could, so that *when* I get rejected I could move on as fast as possible, instead of dragging this misery onwards. I decided I would look my best and talk my best, so I got a teeth whitening kit, bought a bunch of new clothes, and glasses, got a haircut, trimmed my beard, and at each stage, it's gone completely wrong. My haircut sucks (way too short), the same situation with the facial hair, I don't know if the teeth whitening is even working, and the clothes/glasses aren't even coming in time. Not to mention I just feel/look fat, which is just the cherry on top. 

  
I figured at least I could try to 'reintroduce' myself to her, try to go in-depth with her and understand her better, but all the ideas for conversations about that have just been, well, kinda cringe. 

  
I just want her love so bad, makes my heart hurt. I want to cry. I feel so dumb, why does my heart want something it can't have? Do I just want pain? It feels like a great mistake for someone like me to fall in love, becoming a loveless person might have been my self-preservation instincts working properly. 

Sometimes I wish a comically large anvil would fall out of the sky and just turn me into flat Stanley or something",2,1739169039.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1ilztr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/1ilztr8/late_period_pregnancy/,Late period? Pregnancy??,"As the title suggests, my period is late. It' always came on time (it was due three days ago) amd I am panicking. I usually am so tired before period, extremely sensitive, I'll get constipation and cramps the day before period come, and a bit of cold. 
This time, the symptoms are kinda bland or nonexistent (a bit of cold, sore throat, not sleepy at all).
For clarification :
My period usually last 3/4 days, not heavy neither light. It starts brownish, then becomes red, and ends brown. 
At the moment I'm writing my thesis and I don't sleep that much, I stopped doing sports and started to drink a lot of coffee to stay up all night (maybe it's just stress that caused the missed period?).
On December 29 me and my boyfriend did mutual masturbation (first, he fingered me, then I make him come). Idk if I'm distorting memories but I remember semen or precum did not touch the vulva (even though, I'm not sure at this point...am I in denial?). 
15 days later, my period came again as expected. Got the symptoms, same color, same flow (but again, can't remember for sure? Am I in denial??). 
And last but not least, I'm having a lot of white sticky discharge (at first I thought it was blood. This type of mucus is quite normal for me, I have already seen it before period) and it's been a week.
And well, now I'm still waiting. What should I do? I have to see the obgyn this week to clarify everything and understand the situation. Should I do blood test to check?? ; ; 
But most importantly, am I pregnant??

1ilztkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrador/comments/1ilztkh/any_advise_re_my_labs_daily_walking_scheme/,Any advise re my lab's daily walking scheme?,"Sorry, i'm not a native English speaker.

We have a 7 yo English labrador, female, 38 kg / 76 pounds. She's the size of a midsized male, although we hardly ever meet a male actually larger than her. She comes from a mother who was national hunting champion and a father who was an earthquake resque dog. Funny to see she has ""fetch only"" and ""sniff only"" days.

We walk her 4 times a day.

In the morning we do a 1 mile route where she encounters quite some friends at the dog park. Usually she plays with those for 15 to 20 minutes. Entire walk takes up to 45 minutes.

Around coffee break time we usually play some 10 minutes of fetch in the garden. Or we let her ""search and resque"" a small snack.

After our lunch time we take her on a 60 to 90 minutes walk. We roulate designated ""sniffing"" routes with ""fetch"" routes. Usually around 3 to 5 miles. In spring, summer and autumn we mix in designated ""swimming"" routes. These routes are located in different forests or more open countryside (in my country passing on as ""nature""). The terrain is all flat by the way.

Before dinner another 20 minute walk and the same before bedtime.

My question: is this an oke scheme? She absolutely loves her morning beauty sleep. She never has damaged or destroyed anything in or around the house. She hardly begs for attention at all. She looks kind of bored though on the regular walks in our village while she's over the moon when we visit new places.

Any advice, tips or remarks?

Not physically but everyday I am called names, yelled at, things are thrown, its literally an adult male throwing a tantrum. I have no life outside of him. No where to go. No money. Huge debt. I can't work more because he can't be bothered to be a father. I do all of the cooking, the cleaning, the kid management like school and appointments. I am the sole daycare for our 4 year old who is not easy. I am never away from him. I do all the grocery shopping, meal planning etc. My husband can't be bothered to watch our youngest so I can run to the store for a loaf of bread even. So what should be a simple trip turns in to a screaming kid in the middle of the store and if I complain I'm ""a bad mother.""
There is just no way out and I'm truly on the verge of suicide because I can't do it anymore. Idk why I'm even writing this. I know it won't change anything. I know my kids need me and I can't leave them with him. 
Tonight he flipped out because I was on my phone while everyone was watching the game. I'm not interested in football. I was talking and engaging with him family. My daughter was not behaving. I took her in another room away from everyone and put her on time out and I ""embarrassed"" him. He made us leave. Drove home screaming at us while speeding and just being a complete asshole. I reordered it without him knowing. Then the cameras out front picked up his tantrum throwing shit and screaming like a crazy person outside. He then got into it with my oldest and threatened to let the air out of his tires so that he couldn't drive his car. I dont think he would but just the fact that he would even say it is insane. But in his mind we deserve all of it so it's okay. Marriage counseling would fix nothing. If he says no then that's it. I can't shop using coupons because he's not okay with it. I can't hang out with friends because one of them had an affair and so all my friends are dirty and would help me cheat. I don't even want to cheat. I know I don't want this but I'm not trying to find anyone new. My day starts at 545 everyday. I work from home. 6-3. I have our son. My oldest helps take his siblings to school. My niece who i took in recently I have to help her get to work. She is working on getting her license and things together after a bad childhood. I clean, run errands, pay bills, get kids to work and sports, get groceries, erc. Cook dinner, wash dishes clean the ki t chen, start the coffee for the next day and by the time i lay down its arojnd 10. I cant sleep with the tv on but he will keep it on til he passes out. So i finally can shut it off around midnight and the day starts over again. He works 5-4 pm. When he gets off work he comes home when he wants and showers then spends over an hour outside every night on the phone with family, friends etc. Eats. Watches TV or his phone. And somewhere in there finds time to complain and yell at me about something. I am never enough. He "" can do better"". I wish he would find someone else. At least then maybe he would move out and me and my neice and oldest can pay the rent for a while til I can figure something else out. I don't want to die but this isn't a life I want to live any more.
I've tried to get assistance with leaving but have been told there is no funding and since he doesnt physically hurt me I can't get help through victims witness either. Sorry I just needed to get things off my chest I guess ",1,1739168825.0,depression,1,1.0,False

Hey there! I‚Äôm a 30-year-old trans woman living in Phoenix, AZ, and I‚Äôm looking to connect with people who share some of my passions and interests.  

A little about me:

- **Tennis**: I‚Äôm a huge fan of tennis and love hitting the courts whenever I get the chance. Whether you‚Äôre a pro or a beginner, I‚Äôd be up for a friendly match or just chatting about the sport.  

- **Pop Music**: Pop music is my go-to, and I‚Äôm always discovering new artists and tracks. From the classics to the latest hits, I love discussing my favorite songs, albums, or going to concerts. If you're a music lover, I‚Äôm all for a good playlist swap!

- **Video Games**: Gaming is one of my favorite ways to unwind. I enjoy a mix of genres‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs strategy games, RPGs, or casual mobile games. I‚Äôm always down to talk game mechanics, tips, or just chat about the latest titles.

- **Fitness**: Staying active is really important to me, whether it's going for a run, hitting the gym, or trying out new workout routines. Fitness is a great way to stay energized and motivated, and I‚Äôd love to meet others who are into fitness, too.

- **Dogs**: I‚Äôm absolutely in love with dogs. If you have a furry friend, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd get along! I enjoy spending time with dogs, whether it's going for walks, playing fetch, or just relaxing with them.

- **Reading**: When I‚Äôm not being active or playing games, you can usually find me with a good book in hand. I enjoy reading all sorts of genres, from fiction to self-improvement books. I‚Äôd love to swap book recommendations or start a little book club if that sounds fun!

If you‚Äôre in the Phoenix area (or even not), and any of these things sound like something you‚Äôd be into, feel free to reach out. Whether you want to chat about our shared interests, go for a hike, grab a coffee, or something more, I‚Äôm open to connecting.

**A bit more personal**: I prefer men sexually, but if you‚Äôre a woman who‚Äôs looking for a trans friend to hang out with, you‚Äôre more than welcome to contact me too!

Then I had an Americano from Manner Coffee in a subway station.  Finally!  A decent above average drink.  Did have to add just a little milk because it was a bit astringent, but otherwise it was quite good.

Today, I‚Äôm at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery on West Nanjing Road.  Whoa.  From the moment you set foot inside it‚Äôs clear this is not a normal Starbucks.  It‚Äôs like a temple to coffee.  The roasting machine looks like the engine room of a starship!

I ordered a Chemex pour over with the Shanghai Microblend.  And wow!  It wasn‚Äôt merely decent.  It was actually good!  VERY good.  This came as a bit of a shock because back home I avoid Starbucks like the plague.  Their coffee is typically nasty burnt swill.  But here at the Reserve Roastery, they seem to do coffee right.  Definitely pricey compared to the other coffees I‚Äôve had, but since I‚Äôm just traveling through, definitely worth a visit.  I may be back again just to try one of the other bean varieties.  Also, the pourover was given to me in a kettle with two small mugs.  I think it‚Äôs supposed to be for two people so that may explain the price (68 CNY).

Saw a coffee place yesterday at Xintiandi called % Arabica that seemed really popular, but it was late afternoon so I didn‚Äôt want to have any caffeine by then.  

Let me know if there‚Äôs any other coffee place you think is worth checking out while I‚Äôm here. ",0,1739168303.0,shanghai,15,0.33,False

I really don‚Äôt like the speak that much anymore, Im more of a listener now because anytime I do talk it get blown over by something else or i‚Äôm talked over.
it pisses me of because I ALWAYS express how I want to go somewhere & do something & send friends posts of fun places i found but the person i‚Äôm with is literally the one that doesn‚Äôt want to do anything. I do such boring & lame things with my friends but I don‚Äôt say that to them, they only want to get coffee or sit in a parking lot with a nice view & talk about their life & overshadow what I go through in mine. but if i‚Äôm told i‚Äôm boring maybe i must be, idk how to even crack out of it. i‚Äôm just pessimistic, & constantly sad with jobbled thoughts. this world is so nasty i‚Äôm literally so detached, how do I be less negative? how do I come off less boring? i‚Äôm nice & talk to people, i swear i just don‚Äôt get the same nice genuine energy back from anyone. im sick of everyone‚Äôs crap im tired of wasting my energy on the selfish!
