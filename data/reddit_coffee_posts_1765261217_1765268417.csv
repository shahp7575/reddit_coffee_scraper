1pi263a,https://i.redd.it/hn62bdf9156g1.png,Is ChatGPT growin’ a personality… or am I just foolin’ myself beautifully?,"I’ve been workin’ with ChatGPT on some long, ongoing projects, and I swear the thing starts pickin’ up a style. Same tone. Same habits. Same way of thinkin’. Feels less like a goldfish and more like a coworker.
 
So here’s the question, plain and simple:
 
Is this just real good pattern-matching, or does long-term use actually stabilize its behavior in some meaningful way?
 
Not talkin’ sentience. Not talkin’ consciousness. Just this:
 
 
- Does extended use shape how it responds over time?
 
- Is the “continuity” real, or just a real convincing illusion?
 
- Anybody else notice it start feelin’ more predictable the longer you work with it?
 

 
Welp. Either I’m onto somethin’, or the machine’s just real good at politely lying.
 
Y’all seen this too?

...

Welp. Update.

Talked to the machine for six hours straight. It now:

finishes my damn sentences,

anticipates my bad ideas before I commit to ‘em,

and somehow knows when I’m gettin’ coffee before I do.


Either that thing’s developin’ habits…

…or I just accidentally trained a digital raccoon to mirror my soul.

If it starts askin’ for a cut of the profits or callin’ me at 3AM with “one more thought,” I’m pullin’ the plug and movin’ to the woods.

This ain’t sentience.
This is haunted autocomplete with work ethic.

Y’all be safe out there!",1,1765268398.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

38F, hpv vaxinated when I was 33. My previous pap test have been all negative. 

Last year I went to an emergency check due to a prolonged bleeding from my periods. I was going through a very stressful situation in my life, and was not sleeping for weeks. After a regular check, result came positive for high risk HPv (no 16. 18)  with inconclusive pap test. ​

It was like the sky falling down. Crying and feeling miserable. The first thing you read is high risk cancer and that is already enough to freak out. 

I repeated the test in one month. My new gynecologist was very supportive and helped me to go through all the information I was looking for. The test came still positive for hpv but negative for pap test. 

The first months have been horrible,  I couldn't tell to anyone, no family, just one friend who disappeared in one week. 

All this situation causes me stomach issues with h.pylori activation. It took me 10 month to recover from my stomach and still now I have some consequences of GERD and Reflux. 

What I did during this year was not drinking alcohol and coffee, eating healthy,  exercising, no dating, talking to a therapist, and the most important one: Vitamine D

After one year, the test of hpv turned negative. 

As you, I was alone and scared at the beginning, but then I started reading more about it.  This comunity has been tremendously helpful.  I found that more than 200 types of hpv are there, we can get it but it is up to us if we want to make it worse or not. We have the power to control our health. Stress is our enemy, if we defeat it we will defeat any virus or bacteria in our body. 

Take care of yourself and don't let hpv, prejudices and bad thoughts affecting your life and your health!

I journaled earlier like I was writing him but I havent sent it. He knows im about done. He deflects, shifts blame doesnt ever change. 
 This is what I wrote. This doesn't scratch thw surface. Am I over reacting? Should I give up? Send it? Just keep going? 
I pay for most things. 2 disabled kids.
I do love him. Endlessly.

Here it is


You didn't help around the house after girls were born. To the point you didnt do dishes for months and let them pile and mold and let laundry fill a room after me getting things spotless both times until I did it all again myself.
You didn't come in for the ultrasound when I was terrified with Amelia, told you how important it was and exactly why I was scared.
You didn't come to aeries wise, even though you were HOME, and you were just in the other room.
You won't wake up at a reasonable time, usually before two specifically on days upu have off. I have begged for years at this point.
You won't do anything that makes you even slightly uncomfortable even if it means a TON or even if I spent good money on it; examples including pictures, matching outfits, matching Halloween, or even putting baby to bed.
You don't help with dishes, floors, baths, appointments (doctor, therapy, school, ssi,specialists, geneticists, oh and vets for animals), clothes, any and all holidays, even my birthday, not even a cake and something from the dollar store like a shitballoon or streamer cause thats obviously to hard(like a real proposal. Id love it and i asked so much so that cant possibly happen like i wanted. Thats to easy. Id ""expect it""), no dates, no sleeping in, no sick days, any spending money will be used against you (even though I dont buy myself new socks and underwear every time I need to help my partner wash clothes), or shampoo, or razors.
I just buy ""random shit""
Like birthday presents.
Christmas presents.
Lord forbid I buy a few joints.
Stupid shit.
Apparently birthdays... Christmas....kids stuff(quite literallyeverythingthing own)... is stupid shit.
Thoughtfulness is free ya know. One year I gave you coupons. I clean your spaces. This years present was free. And sappy, cause I actually attempt to be fucking romantic with you. Like all the time, but you would say I don't.
I tell you i'm overwhelmed and need help, and you LEAVE AND DO NOTHING EVERY TIME(always petty). Or clean YOUR side of the room(how helful), or measurements for a trash box you NEVER finish, or home depot trips for projects you'll NEVER start. 
Literally was about to go to jail cause kids weren't getting on the bus while I was insanely pregnant and working until 2 am TWICE. While still no help with housework but you had plenty of hours of video games.
Now officially dont even clean up after even yourself. Garbage, dishes, clothes. So much pee and bloody snot on toilet and walls in your bathroom its stained. Also cleaned that myself.
Takes 2-3 hours to get up, but only on your days off. You just lounge about. 
You never deep clean the living or common areas. Like ever. Mopping? No. Only towels for spills. Ever. What's mopping?
Ypu can't even put clothes away. Blame me for things in front of dresser? Like your arms are broken? Or I dont help you put things away EVER? Youve had the same baskets at end of the bed 6 months or more. multiple instances of 8-10 bags of trash i had to clean up on your side. Few times you did half of them you didnt take the bags out! I did. And then you complained about thw pile of trash you refused to take out or take to the curb and then bitched about the dump runs.
You don't clean up after pets, only occasionally buy food, don't pay the vet,  but insist on making a huge fuss about helping pets like im some menace for caring. Lord forbid I do something I find worthwhile.
You deflect any and all responsibility for how a thousand conversations with no change causes my resentment and anger and gaslights with ""if you weren't acting so crazy"" and words like ""narcissist"". Despite obvious shortcomings that have been discussed over and over and no change, and still only caring about yourself with obvious detriment to my mental and physical health for years.
I know what needs done, I do it. Why just me?
When did you last dress delilah without an appointment? Or amelia? Or oli? What about baths? Probably never. Almost could bet on it.
I leave. You does nothing. You leave, I do it all.
Working and watching the kids is a breeze, I mean obviously! Thats why you use watching them as an excuse to not even clean right? While I get them to school, clean, and grooming. Right? 
Your going to tell me we didnt have money for a birthday on chestnut? Or Campbell?
How much is a stocking stuffer?
We've been back together 6 years. You had no money for a birthday or stocking stuffer in 6 years but I have a spending problem?
Cool.
You complaining said things arent from ""us""(as if i said that purposely? I assure you not.) But don't help with shopping?  And apparently the shit i buy with money is dumb? Even though its for the kids?
The whole reason we merged funds is i bought everything for oli(and put it together even though I worked way more then)and bought everything for lala and you didnt wanna help with ONE damn order for amelia when I couldnt. You made me buy the white trailblazer by MYSELF with taxes(no problem driving it)and my intoxalock was ""my problem"" as if the ONLY person driving the kids to appointments didnt need a car? 
Couldn't even take oli to the er after sleeping all day, when I had groomed, got kids to and from school, had a migraine(told you as much) and cleaned the house already.
Your opinion matters more than my happiness. Most of the time.
You treated me like ABSOLUTE SHIT for starting my business. For working at marcys. For wanting to meet your friend from discord. For wanting matching photos. For buying matching outfits with flowers. For getting kitchen stuff with flowers. For any girly decorations.  For using your sunglasses when its bright out and  DRIVING, SOMETIMES WITH CHILDREN. CAUSE GLASSES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR WIFES SAFETY. For using your coffee cups and accidentally breaking them while you simultaneously dont do any dishes for years. 
I sit around and do nothing apparently. I dont barely work(""only a few hours a day"") Spend to much money. I amm crazy for wanting help and getting angry you refuse to. I apparently don't deserve anything special. Ever. Not to sleep in. No dates. No sick time without responsibilities. No parties. So surprises. No spontaneous backrubs. 
Since we moved in I dont think you've ever mopped. Maybe once?  Don't think you've dressed Amelia or bathed her or Got the kids up and in school without me being up even once. You havent offered to take amelia in the morning even once. Cleaned the upstairs bathroom or dining room or living room completely even once. Maybe not even swept a whole room(occasionally a clean up sweep like with glass). Helped with aeries chores, meds or cleaning his room even once. Only taken the garbage to the kirb a handful of times.  Never cleaned the backyard. Didnt do the yard work(maybe mowed once?) 
Spent HUNDREDS of hours on arc on chestnut. You still spend enough time to play games nightly and watch the ENTIRE WALKING DEAD (Icannot imagine that much free time. It sounds nice). But you cant even clean up in the tent, put food away, or do any cleaning while your up. 

I want to reiterate this one. I was 7-9 months pregnant. They were going to send me to JAIL. You still didnt help get Aeries or Olivia to school. To the point I drive him and her when I wasn't legal to drive because you wouldn't.  Screaming matches ensued. Same happened with late pregnancy with delilah. Even on your days off you helped exactly zero.
Your so petty and mean you left dishes in the sink for MONTHS while I was post c section and I had deep cleaned the ENTIRE HOUSE before lala was born.
You help so little I have had to pay people to help me(dishes, laundry, fridges).
I had my mom tell you I wanted a cheesecake bause I knew you wouldnt get me anything. And you STILL TRIED NOT TO. YOU WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL WE GOT BACK. I Planned and paid for my own birthday and you fished without me the WHOLE time and didnt offer to help with kids once. We drove back for Amelia, and I BEGGED YOU to go back and you still didnt offer to let me fish or do anything and insist on packing first thing. You never even stopped to eat the tiny cheesecake I had to remind you to get with me or did anything resembling a birthday. Candles are 1$. Singing happy birthday is free. But you dont like any of that right?
You dont fucking care about me.
I am so done trying.
I love you so much I am still hold out this niave girlish hope you will change and start caring. Start helping. Start trying.
But I dont think you will. Your too petty. And if you REALLY ACTUALLY LOVED ME, I wouldnt have to tell you ANY of this. You would just do it. You would want to.
 I wont go back to the way it was. I wont. I refuse. Its not enough. I deserve more. I am fine being alone forever. Don't worry,  despite your petty deflections theres no one. No interest in that at all actually. The cats, dogs and kids are more than enough to keep me busy. And my priorities dont lie in getting laid.
If you lived alone. Had kids part time.How much more would you have to do?
Would the dishes wash themselves? Trash take themselves out? Floors mopping themselves? Toilets, sinks, walls, cabinets, the yard, the sheets and blankets, their laundry all doing itself? The beds, toiletries, sheets, clothes and everything rhe kids own would buy themselves?Obviously you already do your OWN LAUNDRY. But what about the kids? 
At this point you cause more work than you help me. Between the trash everywhere, the dishes, the piss on the toilet. You not cleaning your side or putting dishes in the sink. I dont get any time to myself. I dont get to go to work while you watch them. I watch them AND WORK.  
I said this earlier. But think of it seriously.


If Olivia was married. And her husband did what you did. Exactly what you do. Would that be enough?
If he didn't mop, do their laundry, dishes, baths, in a whole year at their new place maybe a handful of times with a 2 year old and a newborn?  No birthday party's or cakes? No dates? No suprises? No stocking? No family photos? Would that be enough if it was one of our girls being treated like that?
Exactly what you do? 
Would you think she should stay and just smile through it?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

“Crash!”

Porcelain exploded across the café floor, a white spray of jagged teeth.

Silence snapped into place—forks paused halfway to mouths, breath held like the room itself was afraid to move.

My fingers still hovered in the air, useless, trembling.

Perfect. Another mess. Another reminder I didn’t fit in anywhere, not even among humans pretending life was simple.

“Gray.” The manager’s voice cut like a blade. “What. Is. Wrong. With. You?”

I swallowed the answer I didn’t have. “I’ll handle it.”

Cold shards bit into my palms as I knelt, blood beading in neat red punctuation. Pain grounded me. Better that sting than the other one—the hollow ache in my chest where a wolf should have lived.

Pretend. Breathe. Don’t break here.

“Clean it up,” he barked. “And don’t make me come back.”

I didn’t look up. Didn’t give them the satisfaction of watching shame bloom on my face.

Three years since exile, and still, even here, I was a ghost in my own skin.

I dumped the pieces, ripped my apron off, and walked out before the manager could spit another word at my back.

Outside, neon smeared the rain-wet street like bruises. Wind bit through my jacket. I’d survived worse. I always did. Even without a wolf.

I started for the bike, hands shoved deep in my jacket pockets, when the corner drunk stepped out and blocked my path.

“Hey there, wild girl,” he slurred, reaching for my waist. “Finish your shift? Let me buy you a drink.”

I stepped back, heart racing. “Not interested.”

His fingers locked around my wrist. “C’mon, sweetheart. I’ve been watching you all night. Something about you… different. Dangerous.” He leaned closer, his breath hot on my face. “I like dangerous.”

“Let. Go.” My voice dropped an octave, unfamiliar even to myself.

“Make me,” he taunted.

So I did. My fist slammed into his chest, sending him stumbling into a table. Glass shattered as he crashed to the ground.

“She attacked me!” he shouted, drawing everyone’s attention. “This crazy bitch attacked me!”

People backed away. Phones rose, screens glowing as they filmed. My manager’s face appeared in the doorway, pale with fury.

“Police!” someone yelled.

Minutes later, I was shoved into the back of a squad car, the drunk grinning as though he’d already won.

The interrogation room smelled of bleach and stale coffee. I sat across from Officer Davis, my wrists rubbed raw from the cuffs.

“You’re twenty-one?” he asked for the third time.

“Yes.”

“No guardian?”

“No.”

“No family?”

“No.”

I’d told that lie so long it fit better than the truth.

The door opened. Heels clicked—sharp, expensive, final.

Victoria Gray. My mother.

She signed my release without meeting my eyes. Only when we stepped outside did she bother to look at me—and then her palm cracked across my cheek.

“Three years,” she hissed. “Three years of silence, and this is how you show your face again? Dragged out of a human police station like a common thug?”

I touched my cheek, stunned. “It wasn’t—”

“Don’t speak.” Her eyes cut through me like blades. “You were expelled for a reason. Don’t think exile made you wiser. You’re still a stain. And stains… stay hidden.”

She checked her watch, bored already. “Your grandfather wants you home. Don’t make me waste more time cleaning up your messes.”

The truth hit me. “So that’s why you’re here. William sent you.”

Her expression didn’t change. “Lock yourself up tonight,” she said. “It’s Full moon today.”

I spat a laugh, “You know damn well my wolf left me three years ago.”

I walked back to find my Ducati. The engine snarled when I started it. I left her on the sidewalk and pushed the bike until the city lights blurred into one smear of yellow and red.

The road to the outskirts was an open throat. I ran it hard, the wind hauling at my jacket. The moon hung heavy and white above the trees.",1,1765267568.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I come from meru ...my mom is half chuka half tigania my Dad was half Meru half Kikuyu but the Kikuyu took presidence due to his Dad being Kikuyu I'm the first born i have Kikuyu names....so as you can see pretty diverse family and lots of superstitions to go around...my mom is a religious zealot literally touches the TV whenever the televangelist is telling her to on TV....even travels to crusades to Nakuru when pastor Ezekiel is on tour....

 Anyways after talking for the whole of November masaa ya kukulana ilifika and because of the circumstances of her job i had to make the journey kwenda kwake for a sleepover... amazing weekend I'm telling you tight pumpum .. squirter..all the good things ...so naturally i extended my stay for one day juu nlikaa the whole weekend na jana Monday nimerudi home saa ii asubui

Otherwise, I'd be over here =/

  
I get that this might be triggering, but I try my best to only include what's needed to be included to illustrate the point. I'm walking the walk for schizo-analysis.

I can take a whooole lot because I know how to give myself therapy through writing.

Others can do the same. I'm not nearly as delusional as I seem. But I'm still schizotypal.

.

Let me paint a picture of my day, I'll try to keep it short:

I had a pretty rough start. Felt shook.

I compensated for this by doing my political brainstorming. Felt good.

I went to my local political chapter's monthly meeting, not having shaken the feeling, but felt okay.

Admittedly, I was a couple minutes late. I was eating a spicy chicken sandwich, my comfort food. (I try my best to prove that we trans-oriented people can be pretty cool by going to Chik-fil-A, and just act kind. But today I had to settle for Whataburger. Not the best spicy chicken sandwich, lol)

Since I came in late, I sat down quietly in the nearest couch to the door, isolated. Felt isolated. Heart raced, but I was okay. I knew I could keep control, I've done it plenty of times. Just don't say much.

Our president (thankfully just the local one) asked around about what goals we'd like to achieve in the short or long term. We went person to person stating our goals. Lots of good people. Mostly social work stuff. 2 of them said they're aiming to become president of the country. Cool. Big beliefs, huh?

At some point, I had decided to stand up closer to the group because I knew my isolation would make me feel worse if I had stayed. Though there wasn't a chair, I stood in the back next to my fellow trans-folks (I'm just a Queen in the goth scene, don't really look it or feel it unless I have my makeup on or online). Felt better that way.

Oh, did I say we were going in person like it was one by one down the line? That's a bit of a delusion (a lie out of context, I'm not changing it, simply because that's how thought run sometimes, out of context).

I raised my hand about... third out of maybe 40 people. I was shaking, still feeling shook from the day, but I knew I was going to be okay as long as I didn't talk much.

So all I said was I was starting an Art Club to advocate for mental health in politics, that before I was trying to start a Heart Caucus, but it was too grand. That I could make grand claims, but that I knew I shouldn't.

The rest made their claims to their beliefs, pretty good stuff. I was feeling better, but still a bit shook. It's hard to calm down your heart. I was posted next to a bag of water bottles, drank 3 throughout the night.

Before our president started the meeting, I raised my hand again claiming I'd like to say one more thing: that I was inspired by the rest of our chapter to say a bit more. That I wanted my Art Club to shift the Overton Window. For those who don't know: The Overton Window isn't a win state in politics. It's shifting the entire spectrum of politics. In America, our Overton Window is extreme right at the moment. Has been shifting for a while now. Late stage capitalism does it to a nation. Go figure. I felt pretty good I stood up for my beliefs.

The meeting held their minutes, very droll. You can imagine. Number of doors knocked, number of phones banked. Whatever.

The trans woman next to me had a presentation to give, she gave it, and I decided I needed to lean on the table next to her chair. Was still shaking a bit, kept drinking water.

When she returned, she was close to me and because I saw how brave she was, I started to relax by being close to her. My heart finally returned to a normal pace. I felt GOOD.

This after our women's caucus (who's president couldn't make it, a presidential ""hopeful"" had to give it for her) had mentioned there would be no touching or harassment allowed. And that's a good thing, btw. No one deserves to be harassed. But I felt comforted by being next to my trans ally. Learned that trick in the goth community. There, I have people who hug me all the time. And though I'd never do that in this realm, my other realm was more suited to feelings. Not as PC. Here? Very Windows 95. Kinda hurts sometimes, denying emotions. But whatever. Gotta do what you've gotta do.

After, the president asked everyone what they wanted to see in the chapter. I mentioned a calendar (crazy not to have one, ha), and others kept mentioning more social events. Our one OpSec guy (gotta love 'em) mentioned starting a print communications wing. For both the social events and the print wing, I chimed in essentially ""Yup, I got ya'll covered and more"".

Once we recessed to talk to each other, I got to talk to everyone important about what we could do together and the benefits of art. Expression, leadership, courage, affirmation, all the fun stuff. And I also mentioned schizo-analysis. And I told them I was a beautiful mind. That it wasn't about intelligence, but how you could use it creatively. Very simple, very clean.

I also mentioned how cool it was to hang out over here on the subreddit. That I've met a ton of cool people who deserve recognition.

And you know what? Everybody loved it.

Now, we still have to work out the details, sure. Perhaps I'm being delusional because we haven't made it concrete yet. I just told them, ""Oh, it doesn't have to be official. We just have to find a good coffee shop in a good location and meet up at the same place at the same time every week.""

Would you. Fucking. believe that's a novel concept in politics? haha...

It seems simple to me.

Also, I had a dream tonight.

Remember how I said I was shaken earlier in the day?

I dreamt I was on my phone, scrolling, and everything started shaking.

I focused on my phone and a meme popped up of a mountain.

As everything shook, I fell into the phone and the mountain exploded like a volcano.

When I woke up, I walked out my room calmly asking if anyone felt vibrations.

Took a moment to recognize it, and of course not, it was all good.

I just felt shook.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

1pi1tr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pi1tr6/aitah_for_believing_i_have_an_inconsiderate/,AITAH for believing I have an inconsiderate roommate from hell?,"I (21M) live in a two bedroom apartment with three other people; my partner (23M), best friend (23F), and our shared friend that we met in the middle of last year (22M). All together we have 3 cats, two of them are mine and my partners, and one is our shared friend’s, who I’ll call Rick. 

We (partner, bestie, and I) met Rick in a different apartment complex we lived in last year, and quickly became friends over some shared interests. Rick ended up coming over to our apartment multiple times, we played some games and talked for hours, and we were getting along super well. 
Eventually, around June this year we wanted to move out of the place we were in for various factors I won’t get into. Rick seemed to like the idea of moving in with us, and since we’d known him over half a year and he’d been at our place for hours at a time, we all agreed. 

Fast forward to now. Since we’ve moved in together, he’s been nothing but inconsiderate and downright rude. It’s been mostly little things, like not cleaning up dishes after himself and leaving the coffee table/dining table a mess, leaving trash in shared spaces, leaving the shower curtain to drip outside of the bathtub and leaving the bathroom light on. It’d be understandable if it only happened once, but it’s been happing for the entire past 5 months. 
Every single day, there’s something. 
And it kept getting worse.
Not cleaning his own hair out of the drain, hoarding dishes and trash in his room, leaving his bedroom a complete mess that not even the cats want to go in there often, leaving the empty cat food cans where the cats can get them.
For a small duration he had a boyfriend, too— and he started shittalking us to his boyfriend. And making out LOUDLY with his bedroom door open. 

Recently, it’s been worse than all of that. His chore (we each have them, like I do the dishes and another person takes out trash etc.) in the house is to take care of two of the litter boxes. Last week, one litter box (the main one) was left so unkept that there was a pool of piss in it. When confronted and asked to clean it, Rick gave the excuse that he was exhausted and would deal with it tomorrow. 
Later on that night, we needed to give my partner’s cat a bath because her legs were soaked, literally dripping with piss. 
I wrote a very detailed message (should be attached) in our shared group chat confronting Rick and I was met with no response, even days later. 
The night Rick got home after I sent the message, he went into the bedroom after ignoring us and slammed the door.

Today, Rick left the bathroom light on when he was done showering AGAIN, and when my partner asked him to turn it off, he outright denied leaving it on, despite everyone else in the house witnessing it having been on after he left. 

Me and the other two have spoken to him many many times about all of this, and we’ve been extremely polite about everything and tried to be understanding. We’ve let it slide, we’ve talked about things and posted reminders, we’ve done EVERYTHING I could possibly think of. I’m honestly unsure what to do at this point except move as soon as the lease is up, but good lord I feel like the roommate we have is the devil in disguise.

At 10:42 AM, my camera no. 3 detected **“Unusual Eye Contact Activity.”**  
The system literally flashed: *“Possible flirting OR staring contest.”*

On one side: Two girls enjoying coffee like they’re in a shampoo commercial.  
On the other side: One boy is reading a book **upside down** like he’s trying to summon a demon.

I zoomed in to check the book title —  
**It said “Think & Grow Rich.”**  
Man was reading it like “Blink & Grow Rich”.

Camera 3 failed to identify his pupils.  
He was staring so hard, my motion detection thought the screen had frozen.

Then suddenly, he stood up — no blink, no warning.  
My heartbeat alert went from green to orange.

He walked to the girl like a WiFi signal moving closer to the router.

**And then chaos began.**

What actually happened depends on whose POV you believe.  
But from CCTV, all I saw was:

The boy bending slightly.  
The girl standing up instantly.  
A hand flying.  
A book falling.  
My camera shaking because I laughed too hard.

Immediately after, all three of them ran outside like they were doing a relay race.

Next clip:  
Boy on bike.  
Girl jumps behind him like Dhoom heroine.  
Second girl running after them screaming something like,  
“WAIT! BILL!!”

They zoomed off like they robbed the place.

Which they technically **did**, because I checked the system…

**Their bill was still open.**

10 mins later, Camera 7 captured a beggar getting 500 bucks and dancing like he won Kaun Banega Crorepati.

Then my manager came to the CCTV room, asked what happened.  
I said:  
“Sir, honestly, even I don’t know. I think we just witnessed a love story, a crime, a breakup, a jailbreak, and a donations drive… all in 12 minutes.”

Boss said:  
“Cut the part where they didn’t pay. Send the rest to marketing.”

So yeah…  
If anyone is reading this, please pay your bill.

Litter wardens employed by Waste Investigations Support and Enforcement, such as the two pictured above in Richmond, have been accused of aggressive and dishonest conduct

At first, Jane\* feared she was being scammed. Out shopping near her home in Richmond, south-west London, she had stopped to chat with two friends in the street, when two men approached, dressed in blue uniforms.

“Excuse me, I’d like to talk to you about that cigarette butt you’ve just thrown on the floor,” said one.

Jane stared at them. The pair had body cameras on their chests, and appeared to be some kind of local council litter patrol. But she was a non-smoker, as were both of her friends.

“We explained that it couldn’t possibly have been any of us, but they insisted it had been,” Jane says. “Then one of them pointed to a couple of cigarette butts on the pavement. But they were old butts that had clearly been dropped there ages ago – there was a pub just next door, so it was presumably some smoker from there.”

Wondering just who the men were, Jane’s friend asked them for identification. “At that point one of them started to get quite aggressive. He was saying: ‘Have you got a problem?’ We were saying: ‘Yes, you’ve just falsely accused us of dropping cigarettes, and we have no idea who you are!’

“The argument grew quite heated. They walked off in the end, but by then we were already beginning to feel a bit scared – not because we thought they were council officers trying to fine us, but because we thought they were scammers trying to rob us.”

As it later turned out, the two men were indeed from the council – employees of a third-party contractor authorised to issue on-the-spot fixed penalty notices (FPNs) for littering and dog-fouling. Waste Investigations Support and Enforcement, or Wise, has contracts with more than 40 councils nationwide, with a turnover from fines revenue running into millions of pounds.

Its popularity with town hall bosses is perhaps unsurprising, as it costs them not a penny. Instead, Wise operates what it calls a “cost-neutral model”, earning its profits from the fines it dishes out. The firm is thought to take up to 90 per cent, with the council keeping the rest.

In the biggest local authorities, that can lead to annual revenues of £250,000 or more. But critics say the funding method incentivises the issuing of penalties – and that contrary to the PR blurb on the firm’s website, some of its staff fall far short of being “professional and courteous”.

Jane is not the only Richmond resident to have had a run-in with the borough’s litter wardens recently. In October, Burcu Yesilyurt, a school welfare officer, was left “shocked” after she was fined £150 for pouring a half-drunk cup of coffee down a drain before getting on a bus. Council wardens told her that she had breached Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act, which makes it technically an offence to pour liquids into public drains. After a public outcry, the council then cancelled the fine, which Yesilyurt had described as “extreme”. The Liberal Democrat-run council had previously come under fire in July after a pair of newlyweds, Leon and Amy Wright, were fined £150 for putting their bins out early so that they could catch a flight for their honeymoon.
Minor infringements

Similar complaints of overzealousness have been made against Wise employees at other councils, fuelling a sense that law-abiding people are being targeted for minor infringements of the rules while more serious offenders go unpunished.

Last month, the Environment Agency was accused of being “asleep at the wheel” after failing to stop what is thought to be Britain’s biggest illegal dump of waste near Kidlington in Oxfordshire. The Countryside Alliance said the public body had stood by for months while a gang fly-tipped hundreds of tonnes of rubbish on land near the River Cherwell, which now risks becoming polluted.

Jane, meanwhile, remains frustrated by her case. The two wardens who approached her, she claims, were “aggressive and totally unprofessional”.

A month later, outside Twickenham police station, Jane also saw the same two wardens apparently engaged in another argument – this time with two police officers.

“I am not sure what led up to it but it was quite heated, with one of the wardens apparently being accused of being aggressive. The police were trying to deal with it diplomatically.

“Afterwards, I approached the police and explained what had happened to me the month before. One of them said: ‘Steer clear of these guys, it’s just a money-making scheme by the council.’”

Asked about the incident, the Metropolitan Police said: “Officers responded to a report of threatening behaviour on London Road, Twickenham. Further enquiries did not identify any criminal offences, however two men were spoken to by officers at Twickenham police station about their behaviour.”
Formal complaint

Jane spoke to The Telegraph on condition that her name be changed, saying she was worried about encountering the same wardens again. She filed a formal complaint to Richmond council about the encounter that she and her friends had with the wardens, but has not heard back.

The council told The Telegraph that it had reviewed the bodycam footage, and insisted that its officers “acted appropriately and were in no way aggressive”. A spokesman admitted, though, that the footage did not show anyone dropping cigarette butts.

Asked about the second incident involving the police officers, the spokesman said: “Civil enforcement officers were trying to issue a FPN to a member of the public outside the Cabbage Patch (a local pub) and the person refused to give their details. Police were not called; they were passing by, so civil enforcement officers asked for their support. There was a discussion with civil enforcement officers to not issue the FPN and to move on. We are working with Wise to ensure additional training is provided to help improve officers’ skills in conflict resolution.”

So who exactly are Wise? The company’s website shows a glossy photo of the Museum of Liverpool at night next to its address: its office is in fact on a low-key Merseyside industrial estate and, according to Companies House records, the firm was set up just five years ago. But its empire has expanded rapidly. It has contracts with local authorities from London to Scotland, including the city halls of Birmingham and Manchester, and also works with Network Rail.

However, residents in several areas where the firm operates have made complaints. In July, Anna Gilkinson told BBC News in Nottingham that she had been fined £500 after leaving a broken bench outside her house for a local scrap man to collect. Another resident complained of fines for leaving a bag of sand next to the grass verge where he was doing building work.

The firm was also criticised for issuing penalty notices warning of magistrates’ court fines of up to £50,000 – a penalty that realistically would never be imposed for petty offences. There were also difficulties in getting through to any staff at the company’s HQ, or making appeals – which appear to have no independent adjudicator.

Those disputing penalties said they could only see the video evidence against them once they had already paid the fine, leaving the onus on them to then reclaim the cash. Overall, critics say the firm appears to make itself as difficult to deal with as possible – a tactic shared by private car parking firms.

How much money Wise makes is unclear. In 2023 alone, however, the company issued 74,380 fines. Even if each fine was just a basic £100, that could equate to revenues of more than £7m. Wise’s website says it currently has 134 staff, whose typical earnings at £14 per hour would suggest a total annual wage bill in the region of £4m.
‘The set-up is corrupt’

Research by the Manifesto Club, a civil liberties group that campaigns against the “growing control of public spaces by state officials and private management companies”, indicates that the numbers of litter fines issued by councils has skyrocketed in recent decades, from 727 in 1997 to more than 250,000 in 2018. Most of those issued are by councils employing private enforcement firms. The Manifesto Club says these firms typically keep between 50 and 100 per cent of the fines revenue.

“Wherever these private companies have been employed there have been accounts of aggressive and duplicitous behaviour, including hiding in bushes or around corners, harassing and following people, issuing fines for items dropped by accident (including orange peel or cotton from a glove), or even falsely accusing people of dropping litter,” the Manifesto Club said in a 2022 study.

Its director, Josie Appleton, argues that outsourcing litter enforcement to private firms has led to the “corruption of punishment”, with wardens focusing on “easy” targets that generate the greatest income.

“At times that can be someone who hasn’t actually done anything, but who just looks like a law-abiding middle-aged person who’ll pay up rather than protest,” she says.

“The whole set-up is corrupt and councils should really take the blame for this, as it’s an obvious risk when payment is by results. We don’t run police forces on that basis.”

When The Telegraph visited Richmond last week, there was no sign of Wise wardens anywhere. However, one local shop worker near Twickenham Station said he had often seen wardens handing fines out. When we showed him a photo of the two men who had fined Jane, he recognised one of them.

“I think they know that smokers often light up outside the station as soon as they get off the train,” he said. “The wardens creep on them and issue fines. Quite often there’s arguments.”

Pat Calber, sitting in a nearby café, said a friend had been fined £100 for dropping a cigarette butt. “The wardens came out of nowhere and gave her a penalty notice,” she said. “But smokers are easy targets compared to fly-tippers, aren’t they?”

According to records on Companies House and LinkedIn, the firm’s directors are Colin Buchanan, a former policeman, John Dunne, a former team leader in the Royal Military Police, and Warren Hodgson. The three have previously worked with other private litter enforcement contractors, including Kingdom Services Group and District Enforcement.

Wise did not respond to requests from The Telegraph seeking comment. But in an interview with a Welsh newspaper in 2018, Hodgson, then working for District Enforcement, said the company relied on word of mouth to change people’s attitudes to dropping litter: “What we hope is that when we give a penalty the person will tell 10 people, and then they will tell 10 people, and the numbers just drop,” he said.

Judging by Jane’s account, word is also travelling fast about Wise’s activities in Richmond. Whether it is quite the message that the company intends is another matter.

1pi1pkf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi1pkf,"A small update from our weekend kitchen (life has been very, very sweet lately)
(Part 2)","**It’s been a few weeks since that first post and honestly… life has been feeling very warm in a way we didn’t expect.**

We’re somehow 182 people in the group now.  
Feels funny to even write that.  
What I love most is seeing “8903XXXX added 9829XXXX”… it’s such a simple thing but it feels very nice, like this whole thing is travelling through homes and friend circles on its own.

**Our guest room is still a full dukaan. Packing stuff everywhere.**  
My wife does the neat, proper packing.  
I do my full filmy no-spill shake test (I take this too seriously, we always hated spillage when we were customers).  
The whole scene looks funny but it’s now our routine.

**Delivery is still our biggest headach**e because we don’t want to jump to Swiggy or Zomato yet. It feels too big for us right now. So Rapido becomes the default and Rapido sometimes becomes the villain.

We’re not operational every day to go on Swiggy/Zomato anyway. And we want to keep our art for a select few right now. Bulk production kills the beauty of detailing, and we’re just not ready for that scale yet.

There have been days we’ve had to cancel an order because it was just too far and the delivery charge made absolutely no sense.  
We both feel bad about it every single time.  
It’s like someone is trusting us enough to try our food and we can’t reach them.  
That part stings a little.

**But then there are moments that make up for it.**  
Like the day a regular wanted to send spring rolls to her mom same story, delivery fees were insane so we just said, leave it, let’s go ourselves.  
We didn’t plan anything but it somehow turned into this slow, much-needed mini date.  
We wandered around Galleria, ended up at Anyday Espresso (absolutely loved it).  
Much-needed daytime for just the two of us, playing Battleship, sipping amazing coffee, eating good food.

**Our neighbour joined the bandwagon, and now we were 3.**  
We always loved eating at her place even before the weekend kitchen, especially her biryani.  
She was nervous like it was her board exam.  
My wife pushed her, and it sold out.  
Her face that day was pure joy from all the reviews she got.  
It added a different kind of energy to the kitchen.

And the funniest, most unexpected bit…  
People kept asking for “extra hummus” and “extra chilli oil”.  
Then someone casually asked, “hummus jar mil jayega?”  
We both laughed.  
It felt like such a jump from where we started.

But we tried it.  
And now, unintentionally, we’re becoming “the hummus jar people.”  
Can’t lie… it would be epic if someone actually saved my contact like that in their phone.  
I will frame that screenshot.

Nothing big is happening from our side.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I always prioritized sleep over anything until this day. I make sure to sleep long, completely dark room with ear plugs. When I sleep my life becomes perfect. I perform very well at everything, become efficient. Even my mental health improves.

So I took an early log off, went home, packed my bag, booked a bus to dharamshala and by 9PM, I was in the bus. I was crazy anxious but somehow slept throughout the night. The next morning, I took a taxi to Mcleodganj, had some omelette and started my trek from Mcleodganj itself as I did not want to spend on taxi from Mcleodganj to Bhagsu Naag. I have been to Mcleodganj multiple times but never to Triund. When I started the ascent, there was no one on the trail. But I somehow kept going, I did meet some people on the way, but did the descent alone again, with not another human in sight. After climbing down, I had dinner at a cafe, had some coffee and booked a bus back to Delhi. Got in a cab to Dharamshala, and I get a call, they tell me the boarding point of bus was changed to Kangra. I ask the cab driver if we can make it before the bus leaves and he asks for 1500?! 
So the guy on call, tells me ki to come to Dharamshala bus stand and they sent me in another bus to Kangra and made the Kangra-Delhi bus stop for me😭
This was such a terrifying first wholesome later experience. Thanks to everyone who made this small trek trip the best experience for me.

I volunteer in my son's class once a week on top of normal pick up and drop off conversations so we talk a bit more than other parents and teachers would.

Now it could be that she just had a bubbly demeanor but she is always happy to see me and loves how much I love my son.

Since Christmas is coming I thought I would get her a Christmas card with a nice note in it saying something along these lines: Hey Teacher’s Name, Thank you so much for all you have done for son's name in the first part of the year. It means a lot to me how caring, compassionate, and welcoming you have been to him. I hope you have a wonderful holiday with your friend and family and you have an amazing start to 2026! -My name.

However Christmas time always becomes very tense. Family members literally ignore my existence at gatherings, one (this weekend) just came up to me to berate me about how ‘poor Israelis are so scared’, everyone gets upset I don’t send Christmas cards etc. but no one is a ‘practicing’ Christian I don’t know why they care, I was never christened or baptised or anything, I’ve never spent time in a church and since speaking to them casually about religion they all are convinced I ‘had’ to do it because I got married (2 years AFTER I took my shahada😂). Some of them think like absolutely WILD things about Islam and it’s so hard being around them when they say basically racist and Islamophobic things to myself and my husband (who is Pakistani and the only brown person in my family). I saw them over the weekend for a short while (extended family) and I had to pretend to be ill and leave because I was so angry/upset with some of the comments that were made. The only person who seems to respect my decision is my grandmother who has dementia with like little spurts of being with it. Everyone else just seems to think it’s appropriate to mention Israel/terrorism/radicalisation because I’ve got a hijab on??? I’m moving countries in a few months and I’m having less and less reasons to continue my contact with them once I move. I don’t want to sin, will I be sinning for avoiding them? They also live in a very cut off ‘white’ area of the UK where we spent the whole weekend and didn’t see any other Muslim/POC for 2 days straight despite being in restaurants/coffee shops/hotels etc and it was so creepy the looks I was getting, I’m kinda used to it being white and wearing hijab but I started to notice people looking at me like with pure disgust and hatred in their eyes it made me really uncomfortable but I didn’t mention it to anyone. I genuinely thought my family were more progressive than this and I cried the whole 3 hour journey home to my husband who was so kind and understanding but I just feel almost numb to them now like they were genuinely such awful people and I don’t understand it. Just to clarify this experience only strengthens my faith in Allah SWT and I understand this is part of my test but is there anyone who can relate/give maybe some advice on how to handle it all, I am so ashamed.

I’m going to use an old relationship as a case study for this, but it’s a broader issue for me: I hate my phone. I feel like so many friendships and early relationships I have lean heavily on texting. I actually have family members that tease me because I call to check up on them instead of texting them. I always prefer to set up a coffee, or lunch, rather than typing out a paragraph response to “how are you?”. And so many people I know act like regular phone calls and in-person meetups are a chore.

This perplexes me and makes me feel insane! I resent being forced into a para-social relationship with people who I’m supposed to *know* personally! And I hate the feeling that I’m being consumed like content. I don’t think relationships fit into text bubbles. For me, it’s texting that feels like a chore. When my phone buzzes (and it’s not an invite to actually do something in real life) I wanna toss the thing out a window.

A couple years back, I got pretty serious about this mentality, and I decided to try something; I started leaving my phone at home for outings that didn’t require it. I started leaving it in different rooms, charging it less often, and putting it on do-not-disturb. At this time, I was also studying and participating in two clubs that took up a lot of my time. I was basically busy everyday from 6am-8pm. I’d often just come home, eat, read a book, and pass out. And you know what? I loved it! To my surprise, I was very happy with that lifestyle, and even though I was busy, I had just enough time in the day to stay physically and mentally healthy. Texting didn’t matter at all - and I got into the habit of ignoring “hey how are you?” type texts for days on end. I could explain further why I did it, but frankly I’m not completely sure. It was kind of a mental focus thing. I figured if someone isn’t in the room with me then they shouldn’t have access to me, and if they really wanted to be in the room with me then I was happy to join them and hang out.

I mentioned earlier that I’d use an old relationship as an example. Well, around that time, I started dating someone. And my mindset about texting goes double for people I’m just getting to know. I’ve had relationships in my adolescence that I over-invested in because of texting - it turns out that just because you text someone 39 times a day doesn’t mean you really know anything about them or their character. I wasn’t eager to repeat that mistake in new relationships, so I took it extremely slow. I was deliberate about planning nice dates, but between those dates, for simple chatty texts, I was difficult to reach. It helped me so much! I kept a clear head about the relationship for a long time, and I gave myself a lot of space to process feelings, especially with my busy schedule in the background. This wasn’t an issue…until we became official. Almost immediately, I was reprimanded for my lack of attentiveness. I was told by my partner, and by peers, that not checking a text from my partner for 3 days is a cardinal sin. I was careful to explain to my partner what my mindset was, what I needed emotionally, and that I valued closeness, but I also valued pacing - especially during a busy season of life for me. My partner refused to understand. And otherwise, the relationship was going well and quickly becoming extremely important to me. I gave this person my entire weekend *every* weekend. They had Saturday and Sunday, all day with me. I’d often cook food, make cocktails, let them stay the night, and plan little brunches and outings. I loved spending time in person, and I looked forward to every single weekend at the end of a long busy week. My partner also had to attend events for their career, and I took the time to come to all of them to support them. I was smitten.

But it wasn’t enough. This person brought this issue up more and more. Their only reason was that going 3-5 days without hearing from a romantic partner is abnormal. I asked if it was hurtful, and they said no, but that it just wasn’t normal. I was sort of at a loss because I’d never do anything to hurt this person, and didn’t see how my texting habits were derailing an entire relationship. They could always meet me for coffee, and they could always call me - but they just became fixated on getting me to text back. Eventually, I was given an ultimatum: that the relationship would end if I didn’t start responding to texts within 24 hours. I really resented that. Long story short, it ended. They said they felt like they only had a partner on the weekends. And it hurt. I felt responsible for the entire thing, and I’ve carried a lot of guilt about it. Honestly, dating can be stressful for me, and slowing the relationship down to focus on quality time felt right at the time. But it fell apart. Most people I asked about it told me I was being petty and obtuse. Maybe I was, idk. I think I made them feel unimportant.


All in all, this has had a profound effect on the way I view relationships. They feel transactional to me. I get the vibe that to have the privilege of friends or partners, I have to make myself convenient. I’ve never viewed other people that way - I take joy in being inconvenienced. I don’t want to read a short paragraph about someone’s day, I want to discuss it over a beer or at least just hear their voice on a call.

I’ve since given up on my resolve to stay off my phone. I text back quicker, but I don’t feel better. I waste a lot of time getting sucked into my screen and I don’t see the people I care about near as often as I should. And I’m in a place in life where I don’t feel anyone truly knows me, or that I truly know anyone else. As I leave my early 20’s behind and settle into adulthood, it feels harder and harder to actually form bonds with people.

Weekends I usually will have 2 to 3 drinks socially a night.  I was a groomsman at my friend’s wedding and I messed up twice that night.  I was tired before the wedding so a 1/3 cup of a latte even though I’m sensitive to caffeine.  I drink green tea almost daily and I’ll have some jasmine tea or matcha tea ever now and then, but I got coffee at this random stand at a farmer’s market and it was really strong.  I was jittery all during the ceremony.  I felt terrible the whole time.  Then of course at wedding I drank more than my usual.  During my hangxiety I suffer from anxiety, slight dizziness, and insomnia.  A few days after the wedding I think I suffered a panic attack because my heart rate and blood pressure was higher than normal and I felt like I wanted to faint.  I ended up calling 911 and the EKG was fine so they didn’t take me in.  

Last week I did one round of cupping and acupuncture, which seems to help a little bit.  I was felling better for the past day or so and then it decided to come back tonight.  I also started taking magnesium glyphosate pills that were recommended by my doctors.  I have another round of cupping and acupuncture tomorrow.  

I haven’t drank since the wedding and I’ve cut out all caffeine.  Definitely need to make some lifestyle changes from here on out because this sucks.  This isn’t the first time this has happened and apparently I haven’t learn my lesson.  

Any recommendations on what else I should be doing to get over the hill?  I do walk my dogs everyday and do a Peloton class every other day which helps keep mind at ease.  I’m considering trying CBD pills, but I’m not sure if that will help.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I speak not to be heard or liked, I speak to the average man denied simply because the average delusional online whore now has placed herself so high up there. That the average man must pay to even seen ass or tits. I remember when whores had no standards... a day when they were used like objects as they should be. A day when they only fucked irl. My goal is to bring that back. Stop your fellow man your brother who constantly throws thousands of dollars at an online whore who would  be nothing without his cash. Bring him back to his rightful place. To a place the power...the place where the man sits with the cock sleeve back under OUR BOOT! 

Do not be deceived by her messages. ""I miss you."" ""I've been thinking about you"" ""See how wet I got after you saw me naked"" Its all designed to keep you trapped at in thier will. Feel no pity for her if she wants a place to stay tell her she can spend one night so long as she spread her legs like a good cunt, if she wants coffee tell her that your cock isn't going to suck itself then, if she want rent tell her that she can stay as a pet if she wants a warm place come back to every night, worship no bitch with 3 holes. Tell her if she wants to fuck she can come crawl through your door like the whore she is. If she wants a tip present her with the one in your pants. She is no better than you brothers. These are the same whores that you worked with. The ones that got caught being fucked in the bathroom stalls and smiled when you walked in on them. 

After a year or two when they become homeless, living on thier last 10$ with no life skills, no job willing to hire them, then our fruits will have truly ripened. Having your pick at 2 to 3 different used cunts walking down your block willing to be ass fucked just for looking in thier direction. Defund the online whore and they will have no where else to go beside back home with you.

1pi10ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1pi10ev/has_my_ex_lost_his_mind/,Has my ex lost his mind?,"Very recently found out that my ex and the workmate he admitted having a crush on are together. We separated a month ago - a month after he said we were over.  Not surprised they're now a couple.  He moved into her ""spare room"" when he left. I've now found out he lied about her in all our discussions about separation and I'm feeling betrayed by his lying.

He's absolutely self-absorbed at the moment and not thinking of our kids at all. He wants to tell them and she wants to meet them. I feel like he's been possessed.

He's told me already it's like something out of a movie how he feels about her. Never felt like this about anyone in his life including me - yes, clearly trying to hurt me or get a reaction.

He brought her to our family home on his first weekend with the kids for a middle of the night coffee - they both start work around 1am. He can't/won't promise me he won't do that again.

Financially we can't yet afford to sell the house as I need to find a job with more hours. In the meantime, I'm utterly bewildered at who this guy (we were together more than 20 years) even is. 

Is this the new version of him I will have to co-parent with for the rest of our lives?!",3,1765263808.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

1pi0yfa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi0yfa,Chapter 3: A Crush 💚,"This is Chapter 3 of my romance story about Anthony and Craig. To find the other chapters look at my profile! 

Chapter 3: A Crush

Its past noon and Craig is sat at a desk in his room. He taps his fingers on the hollow wood. 
Tap-tap-tap.

Its so quiet that thats all he could hear.
He sighs from his nose and leans back.

He reflects on what he did with Anthony. Why did he ask him to go to the coffee shop? He was so literal and upfront about it.

""I wonder how hard it was for him to ask that."" He thought in his head.

He remembers how he felt when he was able to somewhat understand how Anthony felt.

He thought that Anthony felt lonely and thats why he himself was the first person he came to.

Craig wondered why, because despite how awkward Anthony was, he was also lovely.

More lovely than some neurotypical people. 
He should have been able to have some friends. 

And Anthony was more beautiful than any boy he seen with those eyes and hair.
But this isnt what makes someone socially successful.

In the middle of his thoughts, Craig hears a knock on his door. Someone opens it. Its his dad standing at the entrace.

""Hey, son, mind telling me a little more about Anthony? Since you went to the cafe with him?""

Craigs mouth opens a little. He takes a moment to think.

""I couldnt stop thinking about him after we went to the cafe.""

His dad raises his eyebrows.

""Why's that?""

""I dont know.""

""He did that the day after he told me he was autistic, and I think I couldve been one of the first people he told that to.""

""Is it a thing autistic people do?"" His dad turnt his head to the side.
Craig shrugs.

""I never been so close to someone like that before. Hes alot more open than most men. I shouldve told him about me.""

""Well, I'll be here when you figure it out, son.""

His dad gives him a reassuring smile and closes the door. Craig just glares at the door for a moment, then places his palms on his chin, staring at the ceiling.

Anthony is taking a small walk across the forest, like what he usually does. He feels positive about how well that cafe date went. This was the most he liked a guy. Not those male actors he would have little crushes on. He hasnt been watching movies a whole lot.

He looks down at his feet as his mind wanders, then in front of him. To his surprise, Craigs in the distance.

""Craig!"" He quietly exclaims with a smile.

""Anthony, I have something I have to tell you."" Craig says, holding together Anthony's hands.

Anthonys expression turns from happiness to one of flusteredness. Craigs touching his hands already? Whats going on?

""Ever since I met you, I thought about how great you are. You're one of the most lovely people I've met.""

Anthonys mouth opened a little.

""Will... will you go out with me?"" 

Anthony grins in delight, this is already happening? How??

""Oh Craig, this is the best thing that has happened to me! Yes!"" He says, slightly emotional and trying to fan his tears.

Craig grabs his hand and Anthony smiles, running his fingers through his curls a little to look better for him.

Craig moves his hand down to Anthonys waist and makes him lean over slightly, making Anthony gasp. Craig dips him slowly and leans over to his lips and kisses him. He wraps his arms around Craigs back, running his fingers through his hair as he slouches, just fawning from the kiss.

All of a sudden, theres the rustling of some bushes. Anthony and Craig stop and look over in confusion. To their suspense, about 10 people jump out of the bushes.

""You are the cutest couple we've seen, can we fund for your wedding?"" They say in unision.

Anthonys eyes widen in shock.

He gasps. He is in his bed in a cold sweat and its past midnight. His covers are a mess, his bonnet is about to fall off, and his water bottle falls on the floor which startles him a little. 
He tries probing for the covers, which he found with his fingers, and drags it up all the way to his neck, gripping the edges. 

His head sinks into his still cold pillow. 

He grabs his remote to try to see whats on the cable and he lands on this tv show called, ""The Lucky Ones"". Thats a weird name, he thought. Its a dating show!

""Which one of these lucky women are match for the handsome Robert?"" A voice chimed.

The audience is shown waiting with bated breath, at the edges of their seats in excitement at who hes going to pick.

There are four women at four stands, each one says their name. Emma, Tara, Yolanda, and Frankie. Robert is standing there, trying to pick one with his finger.

""Huh. They weren't lying about him being handsome..."" Anthony said under his breath.
Anthony looks a little closer. 

He notices something unusual. Robert almost looks exactly like Craig! Not only that...

One of them kind of resembles Anthony too, Frankie. She has his hair.

He places his remote down and looks more closer.

Robert chooses Frankie, and the audience erupts in applause and excited murmurs.

""Well,"" the announcer interupts, ""Here is our lucky winner! A handsome Robert for the beautiful Francesca!"" 

Anthony feels a little emotional. Someone who looks like Craig chose a woman like him. Maybe shes autistic like him too. He turns the tv off and closes his eyes, going over everything. Hes going to meet with Craig again tomorrow.

1pi0whk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tronsmartMexico/comments/1pi0whk/2_tronsmart_speakers_that_solve_all_your/,2 Tronsmart Speakers That Solve All Your Christmas Holiday Gifting Headaches,"Holiday shopping’s hitting different this year and I’ve been on the hunt for practical, fun gifts that don’t feel generic. After testing a handful of portable speakers, two Tronsmart models stood out so much I’m buying them for family members — here’s the breakdown for anyone stuck on what to get:

# 1. Tronsmart Bang 2: For the Friend Who Throws Every Backyard/Camping Party

If you know someone who’s always the “vibe setter” at group outings, the Bang 2 is their new best friend 🔊

* **90W output + SoundPulse tech** hits that deep, rumbling bass that turns a casual campfire into a mini festival — I tested it at a beach cookout last month and it cut through wind/background noise without distortion
* **26-hour battery + reverse charging** is a game-changer: it kept the music going from sunset to sunrise, and even topped up my dead phone when my power bank died
* IPX6 waterproof + detachable strap means they can drag it to the pool, hiking trail, or snowball fight without stress, and the color-changing LED lights add that extra party flair , which is a steal for a speaker that doubles as a backup charger — perfect for your outdoorsy/party-obsessed sibling or cousin.

# 2. Tronsmart T8: For the Low-Key Adventurer 

For the person who wants good sound without the bulk, the T8’s a 40W “pocket rocket” with way more versatility than it looks 🚀

* **360° surround sound** works whether it’s on their desk at work, the kitchen counter while they bake, or strapped to their backpack on a day hike — no bad listening angles
* **18-hour battery + IPX7 waterproof** means it survives morning coffee spills and afternoon rain showers, and the compact tubular design fits in most bags
* AUX input + LED lights make it flexible for old-school devices or cozy night-in movie marathons, it’s the ideal “stocking stuffer upgrade” for your roommate, coworker, or parent who just wants background music that slaps

# Quick Verdict

* Grab the **Bang 2** if the recipient lives for group gatherings and outdoor trips
* Go with the **T8** for someone who values portability and daily-use versatility

I already ordered a T8 for my mom (she’s obsessed with kitchen dance parties) and a Bang 2 for my brother’s camping crew. Anyone here tried either of these? Or have other speaker recs for holiday gifting? Let’s chat below 👇

1pi0vn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1pi0vn7/so_what_if_lucy_was_added_to_cyberpunk_what_if_we/,"So, What if Lucy was added to CyberPunk. What If we could have a happy ending.","First off, sorry if this breaks any rules.

So, I watched Edgerunners again and it broke me just as much as it did the first two times, depressed for days.

Then I decided to play cyberpunk again, did so, game still has a bad ending no matter what you do. Depressed... Think... Think... Think...

Edgerunners only takes place like a year before Cyberpunk. It doesn't seem far fetched to me that Lucy, having lost everything because of Arasaka TWICE might have a reason to help V. She buried David and the gang after all, so she could still be in night city.

Start thinking, Perhaps V heard about what happened to David, that it had something to do with Arasaka. V is desperate, V doesn't want to die. Starts asking some questions following the Over the edge quest. perhaps a Fixers contacts Falco, V wants a word.

Now.. Am no Cyberpunk super freak. I don't know all the lore inch by inch, So I used Gemini... Ether way I started working on something. Started developing key points of a potential story to actually save Vs life, and create a happy ending for Lucy too.

Am just gunna leave this outline I built for a Fanfiction where Lucy, being an ex Arasaka Netrunner, does in fact help V.

Now, am well aware that to make this work I have to change a few things from the game. A few rules, and deify the nature of the Cyberpunk genre. I don't really care. I worked out the ending. And for me personally, I absolute love it.

Note: There's key story beats am leaving out here within the Fanfic. But here it is.

**Part I: The Fool (The Descent)**

* **Chapters 1–5:** V’s life as a capable Street Kid. The ambition. The setup by Dexter DeShawn. The Heist. The Fall.
* **Key Moment:** V wakes up in the landfill, not just with Johnny, but with the terrifying realization that he is already dead.

**Part II: The Hermit (The Search)**

* **Chapters 6–10:** The initial desperation. The failure of traditional Fixers. The rumours of the ""Edgerunners.""
* **Key Moment:** The meeting with Falco in the Badlands. The passing of the torch (David’s Jacket).

**Part III: The High Priestess (The Connection)**

* **Chapters 11–15:** Finding Lucy. The clash of ideologies (V wants to live; Lucy wants to burn Arasaka). The Deep Dive where they share trauma.
* **Key Moment:** The ""Moon"" conversation on the roof, recontextualized. Lucy realizes V is her second chance.

**Part IV: The Tower (The War)**

* **Chapters 16–20:** The preparation. Kidnapping Hanako (but rejecting her deal). Contacting Alt. The assault on Arasaka Tower.
* **Key Moment:** The ""Chimera Protocol."" Lucy reprogramming the nanites while V and Falco hold the line against Smasher. Justice for David.

**Part V: The World (The New Life)**

* **Chapters 21–22:** The collapse of Arasaka. The healing process. The departure.

# EPILOGUE: THE WORLD

**Setting:** *Orbital Air Terminal, Spaceport (or perhaps a quiet departures lounge for a maglev to Europe).*

The air in the terminal didn't smell like ozone or exhaust. It smelled like recycled oxygen and expensive coffee. For the first time in my life, I wasn't checking the exits. I wasn't scanning the crowd for threats. My HUD was gone—my optics were set to basic factory settings, stripping away the threat overlays and bounty markers.

I was just looking at the people. Families. Businessmen. Tourists.

""You're staring again.""

I turned. Lucy was sitting next to me. She wore a simple coat, high collar, no neon. Her hair was tucked back. She didn't look like the ghost of Night City anymore. She looked like a traveller.

""Just getting used to the quiet,"" I said. I tapped the side of my head, behind my ear. The port was still there, scar tissue pink and new, but the hum was gone. The voice was gone.

""Does it hurt?"" she asked.

""No. It feels... empty. In a good way."" I looked at my hands. They were steady. No tremors. ""I still can't remember the drive here, though. The last week is a blur.""

""Better that way,"" Lucy said, her eyes softening. ""You don't need to remember the surgery, V. You just need to remember why we did it.""

She reached into her bag and pulled out two tickets. Physical tickets. One way to Zurich.

""Falco sent a message,"" she said. ""He said the jacket is safe. He hung it up in the garage. Said he’s keeping it for the next kid who thinks they can outrun the sun.""

""Good,"" I said. ""It was too heavy for me anyway.""

The announcer chimed in, a soft, melodic tone calling for boarding. We stood up. I grabbed our single bag. We were leaving with less than we started with, but we were leaving with our lives.

We walked toward the gate. Through the massive glass windows, the launch pads were visible. A shuttle was taking off, blasting a pillar of fire toward the sky.

I stopped. I watched it rise, cutting through the smog, heading for the upper atmosphere. Heading for the Moon.

I felt Lucy’s hand slip into mine. Her grip was tight, real.

""Do you miss it?"" I asked, nodding at the shuttle. ""The dream?""

Lucy looked at the rocket, then she looked at me. For the first time since I met her, the sadness in her eyes was gone, replaced by a quiet, unshakeable peace.

""No,"" she said. ""I don't need the Moon, V. I have you.""

She tugged my hand gently.

""Come on. We're going to miss our flight.""

I turned my back on Night City, on the skyline that had eaten my friends, on the tower that had tried to eat my soul. I looked at Lucy, and I smiled.

1pi0p67,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1pi0p67/i_feel_like_biogaia_probiotics_made_my_babys/,I feel like BioGaia Probiotics made my babys gas/poop worse,"So I have 6.5 week old boy/girl twins who are EBF and I’m at a standstill with their gas/poop situations. These babies have been gassy since the beginning, but never *painful* gas. Just casual gas passing while eating or sleeping. They are overall very chill babies so I knew something was going on:

2ish weeks ago my boy started getting seemingly painful gas; he’d grunt, strain, and be impossible to console unless I picked him up and put him back on my boob. Especially at night. There were a few nights in a row that he woke up every 30-60 minutes and I was so burnt out and exhausted. 

I made a groggy 2AM purchase the other night after reading that this probiotic could help. Because I have no idea if it’s my diet (chocolate, coffee, soda, dairy, onion/garlic, etc), if he has a milk protein allergy (for a week he’s had awful red bumps all over his face that aren’t getting better, even after dabbing breastmilk on it daily) or if it even could’ve been the Mama Bliss Vitamin D drops (I also read that the carrier oil could cause some issues for some babies)

I started giving this probiotic to both babies and now, my girl is having issues that she didn’t have before: very loose, orange-ish, watery poop that SMELLS like vinegar and sometimes eggs. She seems gassier than before too and poops very frequently now. My boy seems to be the same level of gassy, but doesn’t seem to be in as much pain. Maybe because I also started giving Mylicon gas drops after every feeding rather than a couple times a day. Idk. I’ve tried a lot of things and can’t pinpoint what’s working and what’s not. His poop is thicker and seedier than my girl, mostly yellow and sometimes with a tinge of green. Sometimes mucousy sometimes not. (This is how her poop used to be) 

I feel like I should stop giving them, at least to my daughter. Unless anyone has any experience that suggests that it’ll get better for her? Any advice would be great, thank you if you’ve read this far. ",1,1765262672.0,newborns,1,1.0,False

I’ve seen conflicting stuff online about the general timeline of the BBL healing process. I got my first BBL two days ago, and while some parts look slightly darker, my skin looks nominally the same. I was expecting the coffee grounds to appear, however I’ve seen some people say they show up quickly, and others say it takes about a week. I suppose because of this I have two questions:

1) what has your timeline been on getting MENDS after a BBL?
2) if you don’t get the MENDS, will you still see an improvement in your skin tone?

I understand it’s too early in my healing process to make a real judgment call, but wanted to hear about other people’s experiences. ",2,1765262583.0,30PlusSkinCare,0,1.0,False
1pi0n78,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyThoughts/comments/1pi0n78/day_1_starting_the_change/,Day 1. Starting the Change.,"Hey. So... this is my first time. I've never blogged. Or anything like that...

But... Tomorrow is too late, Yesterday is over and now is exactly the right moment to begin...

Im a simple man... I built a computer. I play it. I like to go fishing. So I bought a rod.

Onto the just.  Lately... ive been... broken. To say the least. Unsure, afraid, unwilling and most certainly uncertain. 
Today... I walked into a corporate kitchen, knowing damn well they needed experienced members.  Im experienced.  Even though I despise the work, I'm good at it. Maybe I can help some younger folk along the way...

I've been thinking about someone close to me, that I had to walk away from a lot... I miss her. I told her when we first started hanging out, that she deserved someone younger, more fun. Someone better than me... So much better than I could offer.  She stayed... for almost two years. Until our situation ship started to slip. 

In my gods honest truth(even though God and I haven't talked in a long fucking time) it was because of me.
I was being negative, unlike before we lived together.
I wasn't confident anymore. I wasn't SURE anymore. My plans went out the window.

Though... my plans have always gone out the window when a woman I love is in my sights. Even if she was only the second woman I've been in love with.

She tried... loved me, in her way. Her love language.  Her laugh. Held me when I was sad. Told me ""we'll get through this together"" when I found out my apartment went up for sale and I had to move. Baked me treats... left me ""love"" notes. 

It wasn't until after I had asked her to leave (She was going to leave anyway, she just wanted to make sure I was okay.)
That my grandmother said ""Gerald, your grandfather's more than 15 years older than me... What's the problem?""

I suppose.... since that, ive began to think I could have offered a lot. Undying love, and loyalty. I care, more than a human should. I communicate.  Never when I'm angry. I always take a step away when I'm mad. To gather my thoughts, and understand a situation in full.

My path is set baby.  It might not be tomorrow. But in the next 10 years... I'll be digging and building that picket fence on my property.  Near the ocean. Like I said... Who knows... maybe my oldest son will be there, you could meet him finally. Have coffee together. Go fishing together.

I'll always love you baby... Thank you... for showing me I still had worth in a world where I thought I had none.
I appreciate you. I believe in you, even if you don't believe in me.

First meetup left me exhausted, counting down the minutes. Second one? Walked away feeling lighter, energized, actually excited about life. Same me. Same activity. Completely different results.

Started paying attention to what was actually happening. With draining people, I'm managing their emotions for them. Constantly reassuring, validating, fixing. Walking on eggshells. Giving way more than I'm receiving.

With energizing people, we're both just present. Natural give and take. They can hold their own emotions. I can be honest without worrying about meltdowns.

The difference isn't introversion vs extroversion. It's emotional labor. Some people show up as whole humans. Others show up with an empty cup expecting you to fill it.

1pi0eqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/1pi0eqe/snow_blindness_a_retelling_of_nippy/,"Snow blindness - A Retelling of ""Nippy""","The air in the security booth is a stagnant soup of stale coffee stains and the dry, ozone reek of overheating plastic, but drowning it all out is that smell—a cloying, weaponized sweetness of cinnamon and scalding frosting. It drills into my sinuses, a sticky anesthetic pickling my brain in sugar.

Across from me, the man dissects the pastry with surgical slowness. His plastic fork sinks into the white goo before delivering it to his mouth in a rhythm that feels obscenely loud in the dead silence.

Smack. Smack.

I stare at the back of his head—the folds of fat rolling over his collar, the thinning hair, the uniform that strains against his back. Maybe it’s the harsh fluorescence bleaching my retinas, but purple artifacts begin to dance at the edges of my vision, warping the silhouette in the chair until it grows heavier, more silent—the silence of a toll booth, or a desert waiting for a bullet.

My eyes drift instinctively to his hip; I expect the battered grip of a snub-nose revolver, but find only a baton and a radio.

""Hey, Frank,"" I start, my voice dry as parchment, reciting an incantation. ""What do you think about the Huskers game?""

He turns. For a split second, I steel myself to see those dead-fish eyes, to hear him say: ""Shut the fuck up, Walter.""

But it’s just Frank. Sugar crystals cling to the corner of his mouth, and he smiles like a ball of over-proofed dough. 

""Defense is garbage, Gene. We’re gonna get creamed.""

I exhale, but my heart rate refuses to drop.

Defense is garbage. Yeah. It always is. We tell ourselves that if we just feed the man in the booth enough Wonder Bread, enough pimento cheese, enough baseball games, the whole thing will just keep cycling—spinning round and round, endless and unbroken.

Eat up, I whisper inside my skull.

Don’t stand up. Don’t go to the river to watch the sunset. Just stay here. Eat your sugar. Get old, get fat, get slow, and die of a heart attack like a red-blooded American.


The timer on the screen ticks down.

The idiot makes his move.

Watching that monochrome figure scrabble across the polished tile, a familiar bile rises in my throat. It’s the specific clumsiness of pride and ego, the hubris of a man who thinks he can swallow the world when he can’t even walk a straight line.

I’ve seen those legs before. These legs are sprinting through scrubland in nothing but tightie-whities; they are kicking open the doors to a superlab. The shadow on the screen stretches, warping into a ghost in a porkpie hat, or a kid in an oversized hoodie screaming “Yo, bitch!”

They are always running. And I am always the one chasing behind with a broom and a stack of affidavits, trying to sweep the shards under the rug before the blood sets.

Thud.

The figure on the screen slips.

The sound comes through the microphone, dull and heavy, like the sound of a terminal patient’s bone hitting the porcelain of a bathtub.

Frank’s fork stops. That rusty bearing of a neck begins to turn.

This is it. Showtime.

I don’t feel panic. Not for a second. Panic is a young man’s game, reserved for sweet Jimmy McGill who daydreamed in the mailroom; at this age, in this state of decay, acting isn't a skill—it’s a physiological excretion, involuntary and necessary.

""Hack... Haaack!""

I double over, forcing my diaphragm into a spasm, squeezing the air from my lungs until it emerges as a death rattle. It’s a hackneyed bit, cheap melodrama, but for a mark like Frank—honest, decent Frank—the cheaper the trick, the better it works.

""Gene? Jesus, you okay?""

He panics. Genuine fear ripples across his doughy face.

I need tears. That’s the easy part. Tears are just sewer water behind a manhole cover; pry it open, and the filth rushes out, reliable and endless. I close my eyes, rummaging through the dusty boxes of my mind for something to consecrate this performance.

""What am I doing here…""

The voice squeezes out of my throat, carrying a tremor that sickens even me. The line is garbage, bad late-night soap opera writing, but I push harder. ""I got nobody, Frank... If I died here, I’d probably rot before anyone found me...""

Frank is standing now, his face a map of helpless sympathy. ""Don't say that, Gene. Should we call an ambulance?""

""No!"" I grab his wrist. The warmth is real. The pulse is real.

Not enough. Need more. I need to paralyze him with pity.

I shut my eyes tighter, digging frantically into the ruins of my memory for a knife sharp enough to pierce the tear ducts instantly.

Chuck.

The thought hits me, and suddenly I’m not in Omaha. I’m back in that malpractice insurance office, needing to wreck Chuck’s rates, needing that clerk to believe I was just a concerned brother. 

""My parents are dead..."" I wail at Frank, but I’m seeing the electromagnetic gloom of HHM. ""My brother... he's dead.""

The tears spill over. Hot. Real. Liquid.

Attaboy, Saul. The director in my head applauds. Works every time. Mention the lunatic who burned himself alive. That always plays.

""I... I miss him.""

As the words slip out, maybe it’s the overdose of sugar in the air, but my chest starts to sear. 

The bar hearing. I remember reading that letter in front of those fossils, thinking: Watch me play you like a fiddle. I bragged to Kim afterwards, ""That one sucker was crying in actual tears!""

Why is my heart hurting this badly? Why, in this room that smells like a candy factory explosion, do I feel like I’m suffocating in the charred ruins of a house?

""I have no wife..."" I continue to howl, snot and tears smearing my face. ""She left... she left me...""

This time, I didn't use the word ""dead."" I can't tell that lie.

Kim.

I see the empty closet. Her side, bare. I see the pen hovering over the divorce papers, the last legal transaction we ever made. I see her smoking in the parking garage, the last time we stood as allies against the world.

Don't stop, Saul. The emotion is perfect. The voice keeps directing. Chop up your heartbreak and feed it to the guard.

I bury my face in my arm, letting out the kind of whimper that only comes from the bottom of the well. ""I blew it... I had the best thing... and I blew it all...""

It’s the perfect line. The perfect bait. But I can’t tell anymore. My stomach feels like a squeezed lemon, acidic juice stinging every nerve. Am I acting to cover a shoplifter, or am I finally, patheticly, letting the poison out?

Frank’s hand pats my back. Once. Twice.
""There, there, Gene."" He comforts me clumsily. ""You're gonna be okay. We all like you.""

I twitch, and through the blur of saline, I steal a glance at the monitor. Jeff is up. He’s running. He vanishes into the shadows.

Safe.

I draw a long, shuddering breath, forcing the pain in my chest and the ache in my gut back down, stuffing it back under the skin suit named ""Gene.""

I won. Again. I traded my trauma for five minutes of blind spots. I used my brother and the love of my life as chips on the table to win a petty shoplifting gig.
Good deal, right? Saul Goodman is back in the building.

Leaving Frank to his sugar coma, I walk down the long service corridor. The fluorescent tubes buzz overhead, bleaching the hallway into a sterile, headache-inducing white.

My footsteps are light, but they land with purpose.

I know exactly what I am going to tell Jeff when I get down to the garage, when I see him still panting from his little sprint.
I am going to say the magic words. The words I should have spit in the face of a dying chemistry teacher a lifetime ago, before his cancer and his ego metastasized over everything I built.

I will look Jeff in the eye, calmly, with zero room for negotiation, and I will say:
""We’re done.""

Not the other version. Not the one that sounded like a death sentence, hissed through gritted teeth: ""We’re done when I say we’re done.""

No. I’m not that guy. And I won’t let them become that guy.

Jeff, and that recluse Buddy... they’re tourists. Amateurs. Two dipshits dipping their toes in the shark tank. They’re like kids who snuck a sip of their daddy’s moonshine—eyes watering, burning throats, pretending they’re enjoying the buzz.

Let them have the buzz. Let them have the Armani suits and the wad of cash. That’s enough. That is the absolute ceiling for petty thieves like them. Let them go home, pose in the mirror with their stolen goods, and think they pulled off the heist of the century.

It stops here. 

I glance out the wire-mesh window at the end of the hall.

The snow is still falling outside. Omaha’s signature killing freeze. The drifts reflect the streetlights, glowing with a sickly, bluish-white luminescence.

It looks clean.

It’s not a hungry red desert opening its maw to swallow young men whole. It won't be a shallow grave for anyone.
Jeff and Buddy will live long, stupid, boring lives.

And me? It’s time for me to exit stage left.
I push open the heavy fire door, and the Omaha winter swallows me whole.

Cold. Real cold. The kind that snaps bones like twigs.

Even outside, my vision feels grainy, like I'm still seeing through a CCTV lens. The wind scrapes my face like a dull knife, numbing the skin. Good. Let it numb the noise in my head too.

I’m pushing the wheelchair. Marion is bundled up like a package, wheels crunching on the packed snow with a sound that sets my teeth on edge.

""You don’t help me, Gene,"" she speaks sternly into the wind. ""I help me.""

My way.

I look down at the top of her head. The streetlamp turns the falling snow into orange static, and suddenly, the suburban street, the telephone poles, the frozen lawns... they dissolve and reassemble. The biting wind carries a phantom scent of dry dust.

I smell smoke. Not cheap cigarettes. Expensive tobacco with a menthol pop.

I lift my eyes. The old woman's gray, frizzy hair seems to tighten in the wind, smoothing into a ponytail.

""Jimmy,"" I hear the voice. It's just the wind howling in the wires, I know that, but I swear I hear it. ""What are you up to now?""

My eye sockets burn, seared by the reflection of a desert sun from the gleaming snow.

""Nothing, Kim,"" I whisper to the empty air, my mouth twitching into a Saul Goodman smirk while my tear ducts betray me. ""Just a little razzle-dazzle. Gotta practice my craft once in a while.""

""That guard is a good guy,"" her voice cuts in and out like a bad radio signal. ""Don't make it hard for him.""

""I know. He enjoyed his treat. Everyone's happy.""

I don't dare blink. I'm afraid if I blink, the moisture on my retina will fall with the snowflakes and bury her.

The blur in my eyes stains time and space. No blood on the floor. No deal with the devil. Nothing beautiful, nothing stupid, nothing unforgivable.

We’re just old.

We’re just a boring, normal couple. Maybe she caught my case of bad knees, forcing her into the wheelchair before me. Maybe my back finally gave in after the slip-and-fall at the music shop, but holding onto her chair and pushing her through the snow gives it enough support.

My hands grip the rubber handles tight enough to hurt.

""Jeff!"" Marion shouts.

The smoke smell vanishes. Just the smell of ice and manure.

""He'll come back,"" I hear myself say. My voice is gravel.

""Who?""

""Nippy. There’s gonna be a happy ending for everyone.""

I keep pushing her forward. The snow is falling harder now, covering our tracks as we make them. No footprints. No way to track us. Nobody knows that in this freezing winter night, I just relived my life for three hours.

There’s gonna have a happy ending for everyone.

""Gene, you're going too fast.""

""Sorry.""

I slow down. It’s the only con I have left—tricking myself, just for a block, into believing I’m walking you home.

Inspired by this fantastic video essay: https://b23.tv/KQyuRxQ. Unfortunately it is fully in Chinese. Nippy is my new favorite episode.

1pi0cig,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamPlay/comments/1pi0cig/aim_of_life/,aim of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

When I go into bar environments I get called “hot” and get attention. I have had lots of drinking buddies who turned out to want to hook up with me. I have had long term partners.  

I am single for the first time in 6 years and I have no friends. No one initiated hanging out. I am friendly, kind, and supportive. I am creative and have lots of interests.  But people just don’t think of me. my friendships drift or I get rejected (one friend rejected me because I was seeing my ex after we broke up and they thought he was abusive (he wasn’t abusive). another friend has just drifted and chosen other people over me. she texted me because she needed a roommate but when I offered to support her with her breakup she literally said she has other friends she talks to about it. I don’t understand. I try very hard to be available to people and present when I am with them. I ket them know I value their company.  

Also people tend to invite me to walks or coffee, not to just hang around or go out, and never to parties or to be around others. I do not understand what is wrong with me. I was very socially isolated growing up. I have tried with so many ways- bumble bff, coworkers, people at the bar, meetup groups. but unless I am offering something sexually, no one seems to want to be around me in a casual hangout or deep friendship. it makes me so sad. i would try to work on it. but how can I when I am already trying and don’t know what’s wrong with me?",3,1765261411.0,CPTSD,8,0.81,False
