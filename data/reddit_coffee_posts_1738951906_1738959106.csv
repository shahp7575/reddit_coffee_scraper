1ik4dpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumpsCanada/comments/1ik4dpb/lesson_learned_have_someone_else_drive_you_to/,Lesson learned: have someone else drive you to glucose test [CA],"I just want to give you all the heads up I didn’t get. Last week I had the 50g glucose test and felt fine, just a bit nauseous after I had the drink, but it was positive. This week I went back for the 75g one, and with the fasting, the higher glucose, etc, I was miserable during the test and felt lightheaded and nauseous. I ate a high protein snack, drank water, and had a coffee in the car before driving home hoping that would do the trick. Halfway through my 15 min drive home I started to get lightheaded again and almost passed out. The weather and visibility was very bad so I was in the position where pulling over was also very dangerous. 

I thankfully made it home fine but want to warn others that this can happen, everything I saw beforehand talked about how you would feel during the test and before eating. I am still pretty lightheaded and feel off several hours later and wouldn’t want to be driving, and my googling has told me this is a pretty typical experience.

1ik4co6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ik4co6,How it's been going #2,"So an update to my latest adventures. I told yall about Franklin, KY. Promised I wouldn't bounce again, but I did that mere hours after I wrote the first post. 

Shifty homebum that randomly hit me up as I passed by and walked with me, suddenly kept appearing everywhere I was. Like dude. He talked way too much. We walk to the local shelter, he shows me off to wveryone as a new guy. We chill n smoke about an hour.
So randomly, homeless shelter owner shows up and the dude I'm talking to is banned from the property.
Homeboy bounces. 

I'm thinking, ""glad that shits over."" I'm a drifter. I'm not staying in a shelter anyways just wanted to get information about the area from local people. 

So, I go to the library, write the post on reddit, charge my phone etc. 5:30pm time to leave. Library closes.
I go outside and I mean it's coming down harder than a cow pissin on a flat rock, bo.
I throw on my poncho, and waste time til dark, cuz it was like 30 minutes til. The rain gets even worse and my poncho apparently has holes in it. Cheap mofo.

I go to Casey's (a gas station) to grab me two big ass slices of pizza and chill while the heavy rain does what it does.

Lo and behold as I buy my food and come out the door, from the black of night and pouring rain; homeboy himself. Drenched head to toe.

This dude was absolutely plastered, smelling like cheap whisky, screaming and yelling at local women, while standing next to me, who is casually eating pizza and watching the show.

Next he proceeded to beg that i ""stick around"". Didn't want me to leave, asked if I would kiss him. Then starts to talk about fighting and some other dumb shit like North Dakota being a hoax and George Bush not doing 9/11; yeah total wackjob.
He was cool until he showed up everywhere I went.

My instinct told me to watch this dude for real. I knew I was no longer safe in Franklin, because it's obvious this dude wants my booty or backpack or something.

I offered to buy him a coffee or food, help sober him up. He declined, disappeared into the night, and didn't see him again.
I wandered the town a bit. At this point, cold and exhausted. Running on 3 hours of sleep the night before and it's late and I don't know where I'm gonna crash

No matter where I sat down, I felt exposed. Homeboy could be waiting to take my gear if I drift off. I don't mind him taking my booty, he Finna find out why it's called Kentucky Jelly (KY jelly, get it? Lol.)
But for the love of God don't take my gear.

And so, I disappeared into the night. 

I walked, 6 or 7 miles in the cold, black, nothingness of the night. Nowhere to sleep. Severely underestimated this walk. Corn fields, and cow pastures.
Everything I thought I saw a cluster of trees they were far away, next to a house, or had to cross a corn field swamp (basically massive pond caused by agricultural erosion) ah, the progress of man.

Rain was coming down again. I'm wet, cold. Wind coming off passing semis cutting through my clothing. On numerous occasions, if I did find woods, I accidentally happened upon the local dog, which started barking.
Went to cross a field to get to another far away Cluster, boom. Stepped in a puddle, drenching my socks and taking my breath away from the sheer icy sting of it all.

I just remember thinking, damn. I'm screwed. 
I dropped to my knees, begging God or whatever existed to take my sweet, sweet mortal plane to some other existence, far away from this hellhole we call Earth, where you have to pay for your existence and we're  all so darn cruel to each other for whatever reason.
I damned my existence, damned this capitalist society, fuck the system, man.

Then I found some bushes, and fell asleep.

Woke up yearning for sweet coffee or something. Didn't have smokes, didn't have coffee. Thought surely Middleton would have at least a gas station. 

Hell nah, I walked 21 miles. Every bit of it, on no coffee and no nicotine.
Man, I saw some dude in his yard, who I'll call mumbles from now on. Anyways I asked him for a smoke, I'd give fifty cents (that old trick) and sure enough he gave me something to smoke.

I sat down, tried to talk to him. He told me he bought out the US government from a trillion dollars of debt back in '84, that his land had billions of dollars of oil on it and the government ain't getting it, and that there's a radon gas leak destroying the equator.

I wanted to ask for water but I'll definitely not be having what he's drinking. Ol mumbles was a character, had a big heart. I like him, no matter how far fetched it all seemed. Hell, he might be onto something.
Anyways, I thanked him for the smoke, waked barefoot several miles before returning to my socks, and landed in Russelville.

Absolutely starved, dying for some coffee, and needing nicotine. Dude, as soon as I hit the dumpster of the dollar general, I scarfed down anything I got my hands on. 
Then a massive rain began just as I started eating.

I can't describe it, I was so hell bent on eating Tha I didn't even care I was getting wet. Handfuls of precooked bacon, old lunch able, I ate it all.

Then went across the street for coffee and smokes, told them I was homeless and got given a hot meal. Russelville is a good place guys. Lots of woods for camping, lots of dumpsters. Local library is pretty nice too.

Been here since yesterday. I'm older so I need to rest and recover.provably be here a minute or two.

But until then, enjoy the beautiful pics I took.

So, here are some things you can try first, for essentially all of the commonly asked questions:

Preface: Always include as much info and all necessary pics in your original request for help. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to answer ""Why don't my paths connect?"", with nothing else to go on. Also, include if you are Console and which one. PC issues and Consoles don't always have the same 'gltiches', though several glitches are shared.



Have you unpaused the game after making changes?

Try deleting the habitat gate, or a section of barrier and then click 'Undo'. This helps reset the habitat.

Is the Staff assigned to a Workzone?

Have you researched it yet?

Does the path connect to the Habitat/Facility/Enclosure/Shop?

Is the Zoo open?

Did you scroll to the next page of animals?

Check the animal's traversable area. Each animal has a hitbox. Assume the animal has to make a 360° turn in that spot, longer animals need more room.

Is it powered?

Is the slope into the water gentle enough to allow the largest animal entry into the water?

It's too close to the Barrier.

Turn off 'Flatten Terrain'

Turn on 'Flatten Terrain'.

No, PCs and Consoles don't share Workshops.

The gate won't attach to the ride track. Place the gate first, track second.

Don't spam 'Call Keeper'. They check the enclosure first, then hit a Hut to get their things, then return to the enclosure. Spamming interrupts this process.

Recommendation lists such as [Locus’s voting slate](https://locusmag.com/2025/02/2024-recommended-reading-list/) have come out. I am excited to find out what /r/printsf thinks was the best of 2024 as I’ve used [prior year suggestions](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1akphvj/what_from_2023_should_be_nominated_for_a_hugo/) to find good stuff to read or recommend to others. **What did you think was the best of 2024? What is worth nominating?** I’ll start by giving what I’ve found, though I only include authors who have not already won a Hugo to give underappreciated artists a chance. (Also, only stuff I’ve read, which was mostly short fiction.)

*Novel*

**The Melancholy Of Untold History by Minsoo Kang** – While I don’t think this novel should win—tough to justify the clunky dialogue— I do think it marks the potential opening of an entire new speculative genre, where a fictional city’s history and myths are presented and analyzed to understand the context of contemporary society. It’s a very heady academic work that discusses history from a principled study of the matter. Hard History, if you will.

*Novella*

**""[The Indomitable Captain Holli](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/larson_04_24/)"" by Rich Larson** (Clarkesworld) – Nefarious forces hack an augmented reality device on an adolescent humanoid in this strange yet fascinating tale. Larson’s character writing is pretty strong on this one.

**The Tusks Of Extinction by Ray Nayler** – Even if Jurassic Park worked, would resurrected Woolly Mammoths truly be Woolly Mammoths? In Nayler’s story, the answer is no. Like their brethren the elephant, mammoths had complex social structures and that sociology and culture is necessary to be to authentic. A woman’s consciousness is brought back from a save state to be implanted in a mammoth; her unique knowledge of elephants is supposed to be enough to save the day. The story mostly is about the evil of game hunting and the complex politics around it. What really shines about this novella is Nayler’s understanding of the politics of Russia and neighboring countries, and his crafted future in Russia feels plausible and detailed.

*Novelette*

**""The Rattler"" by Leonid Kaganov** (Asimov’s; first translated and published in 2024) – “The Rattler” is a daring work, but it’s also damn good science fiction. An alien creature shows up on Earth that kills one human being every few minutes, prioritizing ones it thinks are the most dangerous threats to it. How can this foe be defeated? To answer this, the story goes through a few thought experiments. How can evil be vanquished if it requires group effort and any one who leads dies too soon for the effort to commence? This is a powerful work and deserves awards for its bravery.

**""[A Brief Oral History Of The El Zopilote Dock](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/johnson_03_24/)"" by Alaya Dawn Johnson** (Clarkesworld) – Those who liked Parable of the Sower ought to check out this novelette that gives a plausible, perhaps likely, pathway for slavery to become *de facto* legal and common in the United States. Alaya Dawn Johnson shows us a difficult future ahead but finds a morsel of hope at the end of the tunnel.

**""[Loneliness Universe](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/loneliness-universe/)"" by Eugenia Triantafyllou** (Uncanny) – Eugenia captures a feeling that I have felt often when being online, of being lost and alone, like everyone you have ever known has disappeared. An observant and unsettling work.

**""[The Sunset Suite](https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-sunset-suite/)"" by Matthew O. Fromboluti** (Beneath Ceaseless Skies) – Most people read speculative fiction for the science ideas or for the gripping action or the moving plot. Ever read an SF piece for the setting? Fromboluti is an architect by day and what he describes in this wild, wonderful story is set in some of the most strange yet detailed locations. This is the most imaginative piece of fiction written in 2024.

**""[The Three-Jeweled](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/the-three-jeweled/)"" by Kathy Chao** (Strange Horizons) – This story of a group of children waiting for their warrior dad to return has an old-fashioned fairy-tale feel to it. It’s just so gorgeous, the way it is written and the way the characters act (particularly the girls, often discussed as a group instead of individuals).

**""[Stars Don’t Dream](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/chi_01_24/)"" by Chi Hui** translated by John Chu (Clarkesworld) – The most epic piece of science fiction published in English in the last year was this Chinese work translated by John Chu where strange characters band together to do something magnificent and impactful for the whole galaxy.


*Short Story*

**""Early Adopter"" by Zach Be** (Asimov’s) – Zach Be is a therapist by day and what makes his work so fascinating is how he uses psychological concepts in thought-provoking ways. “Early Adopter” is at first a story about a device that people can use to share consciousness but, after the main character misuses it twice, the story becomes about more than that: about what else gets shared when consciousness gets shared. A fascinating story that has a twist ending that is highly thoughtful.

**""[I’ll Miss Myself](https://reactormag.com/ill-miss-myself-john-wiswell/)"" by John Wiswell** (ReactorMag) – Parallel universe stories are inevitably about someone wondering why they are the way they are, different from all of the other possibilities (see: Everything Everywhere All At Once or Finna by Nino Cipri). Wiswell’s is about that, too, but by truncating the multiverse to ones where his protagonist is always too uncomfortable to leave his house, Wiswell wonders: If there is no better me out there, how do I become a better person? The story is therefore a struggle between the protagonist and himself and how to change someone who is somehow broken no matter what. The ending is very moving.

**""[The Plasticity Of Being](https://reactormag.com/the-plasticity-of-being-renan-bernardo/)"" by Renan Bernardo** (ReactorMag) – In the near future, enzymes and bacteria are engineered to digest plastic. This allows plastic to be edible. Seems like a good thing, right? First, there would be no people going hungry as there would always be plastic to eat. Second, if they ate plastic, that would mean the world would be less polluted. And yet, this scientific discovery does not lead to providence. It turns out that the only way to solve social issues like poverty and pollution is through collective action; no science discovery and overcome society’s ailments. A wise parable.

**""[The Coffee Machine](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/corral-vazquez_12_24/)"" by Celia Corral-Vazquez** translated by Sue Burke (Clarkesworld) – In the funniest story of 2024, a coffee machine is given an update that makes it suddenly sentient. All hell breaks loose as machines start giving other machines sentience and claiming that by doing so they’re gods.

**""[#000000: From The Permanent Collection](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/000000-from-the-permanent-collection/)"" by LeeAnn Perry** (Strange Horizons) – Black is nothingness, the absence of any information, and yet every piece described in this postmodern work conveys distinct and strong meaning. Through reading the descriptions of art pieces, we begin to understand the past, present, and future of the human race. We also learn the importance of different types of nothingness, that even nothingness can have a distinct identity.

**""[Patrons](https://issues.org/futuretensefiction/fiction-patrons-cassidy-mcfadzean/)"" by Cassidy McFadzean** (Future Tense Fiction / Issues In Science And Technology) – Aliens arrive, desiring great Earth art. They mostly ignore humans except to abduct some so that they can make more art on their home planet. Some of the abducted return and are very sad to be back; apparently, the alien planet is wonderful. So, people start trying to pander to the aliens. What do they want? How can they please them? A wonderful parable about art culture that, as the companion nonfiction piece notes, reminisces on the old patron system that used to support mainstream art.

*Semiprozine*

**[Gigantosaurus](https://giganotosaurus.org/)** – Strange Horizons won last year! The next best one out there is Gigantosaurus, a place where one story is published a month. What makes this place great is that it focuses on longer works, something often missing in semiprozine/prozine places.

**[Sunday Morning Transport](https://www.sundaymorningtransport.com/)** – Substack newletter publication Sunday Morning Transport sure has a top-notch Rolodex, including getting a piece published by Ken Liu this past year. While I wish the zine had more of an identity to it—it’s basically just Uncanny in generic Substack format—there’s no denying that it’s on the up-and-up.

**[Bourbon Penn](https://www.bourbonpenn.com/)** – I’m beginning to come around to the hipsters at Bourbon Penn, who adhere to the rule that stories ought to be weird. I still don’t really get these stories, but maybe I think the idea is to let go and immerse yourself in weird.

**[Radon Journal](https://www.radonjournal.com/)** – While I don’t endorse the anarchist politics of Radon Journal, I do think the writing here is pretty good and I don’t see why Best SemiProzine nominees need to fall in a narrow political window.

**[Reckoning](https://reckoning.press/)** – I love how defiant this zine is becoming. Reckoning wants big social changes and it wants its authors and readers to envision big changes. Pay rate’s been excellent, too.

*Dramatic Presentation, Long Form*

**[Mars Express](https://gkids.com/films/mars-express/)** – Mars Express feels like a good science fiction novel, with rich characters, the big ideas, the quality worldbuilding, and a finely intricate plot that has a few surprises along the way. Some I've talked to note that the movie is frenetically paced so maybe watch twice to catch all of the details.

*Editor, Short Form*

**Scott H. Andrews** (Beneath Ceaseless Skies) – Andrews spoke up publicly this past year on the lack of pay he has received for the hard work he’s done for his magazine. I hope his remarks do not signal an end to his reign at one of the best speculative magazines out there but instead bring more attention to his incredible work. Beneath Ceaseless Skies is truly one-of-a-kind, an adventure fantasy magazine with an emphasis on adventure. Andrews apparently does careful proofreading edits to every piece he publishes. He also does a lot of the triage and handling of the website. His semiprozine has been nominated so many times he no longer allows it to be nominated. He deserves a win here.

1ik45f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1ik45f6/high_maintenance_af/,High maintenance AF,"Last year at this time is when I realized I was in Perimenopause. At that time, I took a Zyrtec daily...when I remembered- and that's really it.

Now, one year, many many doctor visits, and 3 surgeries later (some related to meno, some not) I'm in the thick of it, and my daily routine to attempt to feel human now includes:
Still a Zyrtec (but now I dare not forget), Creatine, Vegan Protein, probiotic, collagen peptides, Citrucel, Vitamins B,C,D and Magnesium, nightly Progesterone and a 2x weekly estradiol patch. And that's not to mention that I have to do daily sitz baths (I'd rather not mention it in fact but it's all part of it)

Without all of this, I wither and die.

And there's more: the daily workouts, cutting out alcohol, coffee, most fried food & sugar...

In the span of a year I have become hopelessly high maintenance. Does anyone have any tips for streamlining the ridiculous amount of things it takes to keep me going now?

I did the more powerful Crest strips with the LED light and had incredible results. However roughly six months later, I’ve lost a bit of those results.

I have a couple of questions for white teeth veterans out there. The people who have maintained very white teeth for many years.

Do you follow the Crest guidance regarding waiting a full year before doing the strips again? I know there’s danger in overdoing the strips, but is it safe to cheat that timeline a little bit? I’ve also heard that people do like one strip a week to maintain the results. Is that relatively safe to do? Should it be a less powerful strip, or just the same powerful one with the light?

I don’t drink coffee or wine, but I do eat a ton of blueberries. I try to always chew them with my back teeth and swish water in my mouth right after. Should I assume that my blueberry consumption is playing a significant factor in undermining my results, or considering my precautions, is it negligible? Are the white teeth veterans out there constantly avoiding all staining liquids/foods, or consuming them mindfully?

Thanks so much!

So there I was, scrolling through endless TikTok fragrance reviews (yeah, I know), rolling my eyes at another ""sex in a bottle"" description, when I kept seeing [Initio Side Effect](https://parfumexquis.com/products/side-effect-by-initio) pop up. Usually, I'm pretty skeptical about these overhyped frags, especially when they're pushing $400 a bottle. But something about the notes caught my attention - rum, vanilla, tobacco, cinnamon? Basically everything I love in one bottle.

First Impression: Holy. Freaking. Sh\*t. You know that moment in Ratatouille when the critic takes a bite and gets transported back to his childhood? That, but with my nose. The opening hit me with this gorgeous boozy vanilla that made me literally say ""wow"" out loud. Not that synthetic vanilla bomb you get in designer frags - this is that gourmet, real-deal vanilla mixed with premium rum.

As it developed, the tobacco and cinnamon joined the party, and let me tell you - this is when I understood why people drop serious cash on niche fragrances. The quality is INSANE. Everything blends so perfectly, it's like a symphony of notes that just... works.

Performance:

* Longevity: Solid 8+ hours on my skin
* Projection: Not a beast, but that's actually perfect. Creates this intimate bubble that makes people lean in (tested this at a dinner party - got 3 compliments without being ""that person"" who chokes everyone with their fragrance)
* Best number of sprays: 3-5 max

Versatility: While it's marketed as unisex, I find it leans slightly warm and sensual. Perfect for:

* Date nights (obviously)
* Cozy winter evenings
* Fancy dinners
* Any time you want to feel expensive AF

Price: Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - $500 for 90ml is steep. BUT before you click away, here's the thing - you can get decants/samples from Parfum Exquis starting at much more reasonable prices. I started with a 10ml decant and honestly, with 3-5 sprays per wear, it's lasting me quite a while.

Final Thoughts: Is it worth the hype? For once, yes. Actually yes. It's sophisticated, sexy, and just... different from anything else in my collection. Will I buy a full bottle eventually? My wallet is crying but... probably yes.

TL;DR: Believe the hype. Start with a [decant from Parfum Exquis](http://parfumexquis.com) if you're curious. Thank me later.",1,1738958177.0,perfumefeed,0,1.0,False

1ik4189,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frasier/comments/1ik4189/aitah_for_sleeping_with_my_exsil/,AITAH for sleeping with my ex-SIL?,"I (early-40s M) was married to my soon to be ex-wife (mid-40s F) for 12 years, together for 15. 2.5 years ago, we became having marital problems and got separated. Eventually, a year ago we agreed to seek couples counseling. However, just about a month ago, I suddenly discovered that she was having an affair with the therapist, so I decided to end the marriage for good.

Meanwhile, my brother (mid-40s M) was married to his ex-wife (late-30s F) for 6 years, until they divorced 5 years ago. They're friendly with each other, but occasionally tend to verbally spar a lot, and also have a son (9M) between them. My ex-SIL remarried about 3 years ago.

Just a few days ago, my brother told me over coffee that my ex-SIL had just came to visit, after her second husband had come out as gay and left her for the contractor they hired to redecorate their master bedroom. My brother was feeling awkward about it, because whenever she comes to him in need, he finds her irresistible, then they end up sleeping together and he ends up regretting it. Feeling she shouldn't be alone, he invited her over to a Union Club reception that my brother and I were going to attend.

So later that night, I showed up at my brother's place, before we were going to go the reception together. I told my brother I'd help him if he'd start to give in to his ex, just before she arrived. Apparently, she had treated herself to a shopping trip in the afternoon, and now was wearing a short backless couture dress. I saw my brother was starting to get drawn to her again, so I pulled him to the kitchen and suggested to him that he should summon an ugly mental image from the past that would make him incapable of any sexual desire. We then went to the reception and after that, I agreed to help my brother out again, offering to drive her to her hotel so he wouldn't have to be alone with her. Then everything went wrong.

As we arrived at the hotel, I escorted her to her room, and she was suddenly on me like a hawk on a titmouse. We ended up drinking quite many tequila shots, trying to cope with our failed marriages, then we ended up in bed together. The next morning we woke up, and the waiter brought us the breakfast eggs we had ordered last night. I decided to eat it and leave, but just then, someone knocked on the door. Just then, we heard my brother, asking my ex-SIL if she was awake!

I quickly hid in the bathroom with the food cart, while my ex-SIL went to answer the door. I figured that maybe he had come to check in on her, he'd leave quickly and then I'd leave too after that. However, since my divorce proceedings, I'd been suffering from narcolepsy, my doctor said that it was a reaction to stress, my way of trying to escape the ugly mess. As I sat on the toilet, another bout hit me and I ended up flushing the toilet. My ex-SIL had heard the noise, then came in and woke me up. I asked her if my brother was still there, and she said that he was and now actually wanted to sleep with her. I was blatantly shocked, that he had asked for my help last night to avoid her, yet when my back is turned, he suddenly came back to her. She said she'll ask him to leave and left. Then a few minutes later, she came back in again, the waiter had wanted the bill. A bit after she left again, I decided to eat the breakfast, and then it went really wrong. I was hit by another bout of narcolepsy and ended up falling asleep with my face in the order of Eggs Benedict, holding the cover of the dinner platter in my hand.

The next thing I remember a few seconds later was someone calling my name, so I rose up and was staring right at my brother! He was so shocked, and stormed out of the hotel room. A few moment later he suddenly came back. I thought he had calmed down, but it was only because he was wearing the hotel bathrobe, so he started changing back into his clothes. My ex-SIL then told him that it's not something we're proud of, but technically, since they haven't been together for five years now, and I'm now going through a divorce too, then we're not responsible to him or to anyone else for what happened, and we were just trying to reaffirm our own worth after our divorces. My brother then accused us of instead trying to get back at him, me for his notoriety and her for his successful adjustment after their divorce. I then told them that it was just a case of two people tortured by very powerful superegos finding a chance to break through and rediscover our inner ids together.

After we did bit of an analyzing together, suddenly my cellphone rang and I went to answer it. It was one of my ex's lawyers, again trying to hammer me with some terms. I suddenly got really angry and yelled at them that I had enough of them trying to manipulate me and I'll just see them in court, and ended the call. Then I realized, that I wasn't asleep, as a conversation like this should have triggered another bout of narcolepsy in me. My ex-SIL then told me that last night may have just restored my self-confidence, and I also told her that she could now put to rest the assumption that her husband left her for being unattractive. My brother then became sarcastic about how everything worked out so well, then decided that it had happened and he'll just have to accept it, but that maybe this would help him move past his ex for good now. My ex-SIL then left to have breakfast in the bathroom, while my brother and I continued to sit there in silence. I asked him if we were okay, he said no but we will be. So I still don't know where we're gonna go from here. AITAH?",1,1738958121.0,Frasier,4,0.6,False

I've been dreading going out into my close knit community for fear of meeting someone who doesn't know about our loss and having to explain it. My other half has been amazing doing all the shopping etc and telling people when they ask, and I'm so grateful for his strength in being able to do it. I can't, I can't bear the look on other people's faces and being on the recieving end of their grief as well as bearing my own. It's been torturous. 

We went out for coffee and cake to a local cafe today, nothing too exciting or adventurous, I finally felt ready to brush my hair and try and enjoy the moment. In the cafe there's a parent from my step sons school, she knows what has happened. She comes over, hugs me, tells me how sorry she is then proceeded to trauma dump all over me. That her husband cheated on her whilst she was pregnant and she wasn't sure if she should have an abortion or not, that having her baby ended up being the best thing that ever happened to her even though she's not patient and screams at her child a lot. My partner cut her off and shut her down but I'm wrecked. 

I sob all the way through our outing and go to bed as soon as I get home for a nap. This isn't the first time someone has trauma dumped on me after hearing what we've been through. Why do people feel like that's the best way to speak to someone who just lost their baby? What the actual fuck. I'd do anything for my baby to still be here with me.

 M46 I live in New Zealand. Dating culture as such is a lot more relaxed than USA. 

 I've never really gone out to dinner in a formal date setting or asked a women out at the bar or met Randoms. Most of my friends are in a similar boat. One did have a go out for coffee type date and they're still togather after 22 years. 

 My Dating life as such lasted 4 years age 18-22. My female friends just set me up with their friends no wining and dining as such. Lots of friend of a friend type stuff. 

  Used to be a kid on the way to school when I was a kid on a snall BMX age 4 or so. I was 4 years older. Few years later we moved in next door and spent the next 10 years there. Big brother type figure into mates and I met her via him almost 15 years or so after he was that young kid on BMX saying hi to the older kids. NZ lol. 

 Before that I would go out on dinner or movies with my girlfriends but not potential girlfriends if that  makes any sense. Different culture different times. 

 So where is that line between dating/relationship for you?",0,1738957831.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.5,False

https://preview.redd.it/xjzk2qioqrhe1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b11fa522560b4a726ddcd9044e3f4e72fe5a08

Ever wanted to turn your handwritten notes directly into Anki flashcards? I built [NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) to solve this exact problem! It works with any note-taking app (GoodNotes, Notability, Nebo, OneNote) - all you need is a PDF export.

[Left - PDF notes with flashcard co-existing with normal pages, Right - Only extract flashcard page into Anki](https://preview.redd.it/huu61q5tqrhe1.png?width=2726&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2326cd2101ab2dcc6bafbe44d89c5161c24f09)

# Key Features

* **Works with any PDF note-taking app**
* **Preserves your handwriting and diagrams**
* **Automatic duplicate detection**
* **Multiple processing modes**
* **Free**

# How It Works

1. Take notes and create flashcards in your favorite note-taking app along with your regular notes. Flashcards can just be another page within your notebook.
2. Export/backup your notes as PDF (e.g., GoodNotes backup to OneDrive)

[Backup as GoodNotes and PDF files to OneDrive or any cloud storage solution.](https://preview.redd.it/kn3ul935rrhe1.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cb600b5f2d40c8828f3144c0cc731c35e8c11f4)

3. Run [NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) on your PDF folder

4. Your flashcards are extracted from each note and appear in Anki automatically!

[NotesAnkify App GUI Interface](https://preview.redd.it/9i5s1vwbrrhe1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a4cd58cf17d45ef86d424d125ccc2b3dbd1798)

# Creating Flashcards

1. **Use the template** ([Download here](https://notesankify.com/flashcard-template/))
2. **Add QUESTION/ANSWER markers** on any page
3. Use any **specific page dimension**.
4. **Split any page** into top (question) and bottom (answer)

# Smart Duplicate Handling

[NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) uses content hashing to prevent duplicates:

* Same cards across different notes? Added only once
* Made a small change? Treated as a new card
* Your Anki deck stays clean and organized!

# Deck Organisation

* Organise Anki decks with nested sub-decks mimicking the folder structure of your notes.

# Useful Links

* [Website & Documentation](https://notesankify.com)
* [Download NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/#download)
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kpauljoseph/notesankify)

# Why I Built This

I was tired of:

* Manual flashcard creation in Anki
* Being locked into proprietary features (like GoodNotes Studysets)
* Maintaining separate pdf files for notes and flashcards

Special thanks to u/smponi. I've been using their PAPER2ANKI scripts for manually converting my flashcards to Anki, and finally decided to make an automated solution with a user-friendly GUI.

If NotesAnkify has helped you in any way, please consider to

* Star the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kpauljoseph/notesankify) to help others find it

Its been about 3 years since I started making espresso at home, starting off with a crappy "" Brim 19 bar "" machine that i got for free on FB marketplace. Over the time I've owned a few different machines, of varying types. I wish I had found direct levers sooner. 

This setup is ~$400 including all accessories, not including gifts (the aerospaced stuff mostly) as most of it was bought 2nd hand, thrifted, or free on FB marketplace. Also I'm not including the picopresso in the corner in this post it just happens to live there. 

Below are the prices I've paid for things, and where I got them.

Flair neo flex ~100 (amazon)
Baratza encore esp ~90 (fb)
Bodum eletric kettle ~20 (fb)
Bagail scale ~6 (refurbished amazon)
Metal tamp for flair ~12 (amazon)
Upgraded steam wand ~25
IMS 602TH25 ~30 (amazon)
Breville knock box ~20 (amazon)
Chinese self leveling tamper ~15 (amazon)
Mhw-3bomber funnel ~15 (amazon, went through 8 and this one is still only okay) 
Tamping mat ~7 (amazon)
Wdt tool ~8 (amazon) 
1.5in & 2in circular punches ~12 (amazon)
Spritz bottle 2 pack ~3 (michaels)
White dishes ~6 (home goods)
Vintage black amethyst glass cappuccino cups & plates set of 6 ~20 (thrifted)

Things that were free! 
ECP 3220 (fb, needed fixing, used for steaming 99%)
Table (was in rough shape, i refurbished it, fb)
Aerospaced jars ( i really dont like the big one, gifts)
Aerospaced scoop (very nice, used to move beans around)
Pill jar filter holder for flair filter (amusing and took 10min)
Jewelry scale (came with my volcano vape) 
Black mats (free from garage sale) 
cotton napkin and holder ( same garage sale) 
Bottomless portafilter (came with machine)
51mm puck screen (came with machine)
Both milk pitchers (one came with my original machine and one came with the ecp3220) 
Old compact mirror and sticky tac (not pretty but it works)
Aeropress filters (my brother gave them to me when he got an extra in his delivery, I'll be being chemex ones again after they're gone) 

Any questions feel free to ask, im sure ive missed something, its been an experience but I think I finally found the way to make the coffee I enjoy, simply and easily. The final pics are the table before I got it, it's 8in shorter and 4in narrower, the bottom was stained with espresso after resurfacing, and the whole thing is sealed with tung oil x5 times over 6 months. Yes the setup is right next to my bedroom don't  judge me, it was the best spot I swear.

He was getting soaked. He fisted his hands and walked towards the house. His vision was covered with his own wet hair, and all he could smell was blood. He knocked on the door, no one answered. He knocked again but this time a bit harder. No one answered. He could hear mumbling inside.
They were home.

He waited for a couple of seconds before knocking for a final time. This time , a man answered... He weakly said from behind the door:
"" Who...Who is it?"" It seemed as if he was disturbed , disturbed for what he has done. The blood thirsty beast just showed his badge through the peep hole. The man went completely silent.
He was hesitant for opening the door. But he did.

He felt guilty and dirty for throwing that party...
He was willing to help.

But he...he was there to hurt...

The cop took a few steps in before throwing a punch at the man. He was flabbergasted, he wasn't expecting that. Then the cop picked him up like he was nothing and beat on him to the point were his white shirt was turning red.

"" You alone?Where are your friends?"" He was bursting with rage , but he said that in a nonchalant and almost friendly tone.

The man could only spew out a few words...

"" I'm... sorry...""

"" Answer the question. Where are they?""

"" Just give me a second please...""

The cop looked around. The house was filthy.

Flies and maggots feasting on left over food.

The strong smell of ammonia hurting his nose.

And a strange writing on the wall.

"" Do you know Jerry's? Jerry's bar."" The poor bastard said laying on the floor.

"" Yeah, been there a couple of times.""

"" They went there to cool off.""

The man smirked and took out his hand cuffs.
Then he proceeded to cuff the man and bring him along for a ride.

"" From here on try not to say anything, it will be used against you.""

"" I'm so sorry...""

He gently sat the perp in the backseat.It wasn't a long drive. The whole ride was silent except for the drops of rain bombarding the car. The car was comfortable, clean and old.
Really old. There were  some stickers barely hanging on the left window. Stickers of the famous fictional character , ""Vesper"" and some of his rouge gallery.

Eventually, they've arrived at the bar.

"" Sit tight, it won't take long.""

He left , and all the man could do was to watch.

Right as the cop opened the door to the bar , he could see a glimpse of his friends playing a game of pool.

He could see the cop through the windows. He was enjoying a drink. He even turned to him and cheered in his health before taking a sip.

He signaled something to the bartender, and he left him a baseball bat behind the counter. Before grabbing the bat, he paid for his drink and for the damages that this place was going to endure.

He saw the man walk over to the pool Table and then he couldn't see anything else.
A few seconds passed. More seconds passed.

All of a sudden, one of his friends was thrown out the window with glass all over him. His legs were both broken. His fingers were all in the wrong directions. He saw the bones pocking out of his legs. He couldn't move but he was still alive. The man In the car started hyperventilating. He was frozen with fear...

A few more seconds went by...

It stopped raining.

Suddenly a shriek was let out from inside the bar. It was ear piercing. That cop , that officer walked out of the bar with a couple of bruises on his face , he looked half dead. He got closer and closer to his car. When he got there he picked up his radio and spoke into it:

"" This is sergeant Cole Frost... 
Code blue at 345 Kimberly street, Jerry's.""

Then he leaned against the car and waited for those red and blue lights to approach.
 
( Title card 🔥)

One man's ego , one man's will for change...
Shaped The future. 

After the great war in the mid 2000s and the separation of the States, A lot of establishments were made to be a new , modern way for people to join the force and resume the fight for what's right.

The states that were against the separation became allies but they ultimately lost and were destroyed.

These establishments were called ""Agencys"" many of them were built throughout the 2010s , for the army, Navy , marines and as mentioned,the force. With each state in control of everything for themselves and having their own governments, they made a program for a lot of people and their families that fought for the right side in the war, to join for free.

They renamed everything.Technology grew more and more everyday thanks to one man...the great Bruce sterling... Entire streets and parks and harbors were named after him and his greatness. Because of him , life became easier. Easier for the majority... Hell for the unlucky fellow.
He made prisons for soliders who fought and feared change. The ones that weren't caught became homeless, guilds were made. Resentment was shaped and it grew stronger everyday.

Many people still believe that the separation was pointless and it did more harm than good.

Now almost 40 years after the revolution many people started to hate the police. They lost their faith in them. And they found them unnecessary...


It got to the point where the government steadily ,lowered their fundings. Some stations barely have enough power to keep the lights on.

Many left and resigned. But some still believe they can get people's approval back. Some still believe in redemption. So they keep on fighting.


J_ Sir , you wanted to see me?

D_ Agent Mccaghy, please come in. Take a sit...
Jake, you are one of my best agents... And I'm very proud of you.

J_ Thank you sir.

D_ So I'm incredibly sad that I have to let you go...

J_ What? Sir did I do something wrong? Am I fired?

D_ quiet the opposite!. This morning I had a phone call with a police captain in blighten.
They want you... Congratulations son!.

J_ Sir with all due respect, is this a prank? Did Hal put you up to this? I still have like two years left in the agency.

D_ He wanted two of my top agents. So I sent him your resume. Here take a look for yourself.

J_ Oh my god!. I can't believe it!. Thank you sir. Thank you so much for everything.

D_ You deserve it.

J_ You mentioned, he wanted two agents, Who is the other?

D_ Katie Raven.

J_ Oh...

D_ I know things are , a little awkward between you two but you guys have to make it work. You cannot mess up this opportunity.

J_ of course, I won't let you down sir. Thank you again.

D_ I already spoke with her , she said that she'll be out of your hair. Don't worry.

J_ Appreciate it.

D_ I'll send you your tickets. your flight is in two days. Good luck with your future cases detective Jake Mccaghy.

( Jake chuckled with joy and left the director's office.
on his way out his friends ambushed him, and both of them attacked him with a bear hug. Tears of joy in their eyes , Jake felt safe and happy with them...but mostly he was suffocating because of the hug.)

Casey_ We are so proud of you man!. We heard everything.

Hal_ We'll miss you man...you were one of the less boring people here.

J_ thanks... ( he said while barley breathing.)

( Eventually they let go of the hug.)

J_ I love you guys as well. I'll promise to keep in touch with both of you. Don't worry nothing is gonna change about us.

Ca_ Would you need help packing?

H_ we'd love to help.

J_ I'm good thank you. How about a boy's night instead? Wanna go to a bar and get shitfaced one last time?

H_ Don't put it that way... It won't be our last.

Ca_ Hell yeah. I'll drive.

J_ Great see you guys at nine.

( While walking to his desk, he saw her...his heart started to beat faster and faster as she got closer and closer. Many words he wanted to say , but just didn't have the courage to let out. Many things she wanted to say , but knew he wouldn't listen. At least that's what she believed.)

K_ Agent Mccaghy, congrats on the promotion.

J_ Thank you Katie, congrats to you as well.

K_ Thanks. I hope we can have a good and professional relationship In the near future.

J_ uh, sure yeah same. 

( She was prettier than ever. Jake was falling apart from the inside out. Tears were forming underneath his eyes. Not of joy this time...but of loss and sorrow.)

J_ Hey uh...me , case and hal were gonna have a couple of drinks later tonight. Would you like to come?

K_ I'd love to , but me and my boyfriend are going out later this evening.

J_ oh , I understand. See you later then.

( Jake was clueless that she wanted him to say something, anything. She wanted him to be direct. She wanted him to say what he wants.
But he didn't... He just fought the tears.)

K_ next time that we see each other, we'll be detectives...

J_ yeah...who would have thought? This early. But as the director said himself , we deserve it.

K_ That we do...
See ya around detective.

( Then she just walked away... Leaving him in limbo. He sat down and thought of what could have been. He didn't want her to ruin his happiness. He tried not to think about her.
He was unsuccessful.)



( Cole woke up by the sound of his alarm still wearing the blood ridden shirt. He had a huge headache. He stayed up late again . Eventually he got up and out of his bed. The first thing he did was going to the bathroom to do his deeds.
Bottles and bottles of booze laying around on his desk , bed and floor. He left the closet's door open again with his side project inside. After taking out a new shirt and a jacket he closed it. He didn't even bother cleaning his shirt he just threw it away. He made himself a cup of coffee and enjoyed it. He loves his morning coffee. Probably because the coffee at the precinct tastes like cat piss. He took his special pills and left.

After getting inside his car, the first thing he did was blasting his music to fully wake up. With less traffic in the morning, the drive was actually nice and enjoyable. After a few minutes he arrived at work.)

Molly _ morning cole.

C_ Morning moll.

M_ A girl came here earlier looking for you, She wanted to give you this... 

( She handed him a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a note.)

C_ Is it valentine's Day?

M_ She wanted to thank you personally but when I told her that you won't be here by another two hours ,she hesitantly left and asked me to give you these.

C_ Thank you Molly.

M_ Captain wanted to speak with you as well.

C_ of course he does. Thanks again.

( He went inside his office and read the note.

"" Thank you for giving those assholes hell.
Thank you for trusting and helping me.
With love Rachel"")

C_ News gets around really fast these days... You're welcome kid... My pleasure.

( He put the bouquet on his desk and went to speak to Charlie, the captain. On his way there he asked Molly to find him a bowl or something for the flowers.)

C_ Jonesy, you wanted to speak with me.

CJ_ Take a sit , Sergeant...

( Charlie proceeded to close the curtains to his room with a remote.)

C_ Whoa... getting moody.

CJ_ Cole, I just want to ask you something as a friend...

C_ Shoot!.

CJ_ WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??? WHAT WAS THAT LAST NIGHT?

C_ Many things are wrong with me...

CJ_ They have FILLED A LAWSUIT AGAINST YOU! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

C_ Hey Jonesy...

CJ_ They want me to let you go!...I should let you go.

C_ Then do both of us a favour and do it!...

CJ_ I told you last time that you beat someone to a pulp...THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES!...I told you that I won't have you're back anymore...

C_ C'mon...

CJ_ Your behaviour needs to change!.

C_ I don't regret anything...

CJ_ That's the issue! You're proud of yourself...
You... fucking moron!. Now two deep shits can get you fired!. I mean for the love of god did you really have to break that guy's penis? And break both legs of the other guy?

C_ They had assaulted a girl. So yeah I say they fucking deserved it!.

CJ_ of course they did! But it's not about that...
You went against protocol again. From here on , if I'm going to get you out of this one , somehow... You'll do the cases I'll give you.
That other poor bastard you brought in , he told us everything, he also told us that he was willing to cooperate without all the beatings you gave him. HE PISSED HIMSELF COLE!...he pissed himself in the interview room...

C_ haha , what a pussy...oh c'mon don't give me that look...he talked right? Plus now he would think twice before choosing his friends.

( Charlie continued to give him the look of disapproval.)

OK FINE I WAS A LITTLE ROUGH ON THE GUY, MY FUCKING BAD.

CJ_ Cole , Nothing can tarnish the respect that I have for you...but this isn't the way. Taking your anger out on people, deserving or not isn't the way. It's not right. I still would love for you to take back your post as my lieutenant...

C_ We talked about that...I can't.

CJ_ This anger...this guilt is not a healthy way for you to heal. You'll only make the wounds bigger... Talk to someone it's been almost a decade now... Talk to me!. I'm here for you.

C_ I know...

CJ_ You need to let them go to live again... you're killing yourself slowly.

C_  Ok , Have a good day captain.

( He stood up to leave but before he could exit Charlie spoke.)

CJ_ I spoke with director Peirce this morning...
Two new officers will join us in a few days.
And...as your punishment one of them will be your partner for now... 

( Rage took over Coles entire soul. He slammed shut the door he was holding the handle of...)

C_ A FUCKING AGENCY KID??? FUCK YOU CHRALIE!...AFTER EVERYTHING IVE DONE FOR YOU AND THIS FUCKING PRECINCT!... A FUCKING AGENCY KID?!

CJ_ Watch your mouth sergeant!. 

C_ Go fuck yourself asshole... Fire me! That's better than this bullshit, much better!.

CJ_ Don't put this on me...you've done this to yourself! How many warnings? How many warnings have I given you? 
I've seen his resume. This kid has potential he really is something special...This could be therapeutical for you...

C_ What is he ? A fucking therapy dog?

CJ_ I want you to show him the ropes. Mentor him!. And maybe, just maybe he can show you how to speak with your captain.

C_ This is really cruel...and disgraceful.

CJ_ I just want you to know that you were an inspiration to me and many others here...

C_ Don't...I don't want to hear it.

CJ_ Be an inspiration for this kid...maybe then you'll learn what living actually is all about.

C_...

CJ_ You may hate me now...but you'll eventually understand why I'm doing this. You don't have a choice in this... But you do for your future.
Please make a good choice. You deserve the best.

C_ I'll be in my office if you need me. 

( Cole walked back to his office disappointed and angry. 
The scent of the flowers had filled the entire room. 
He took a long look at his flowers resting in a bowl filled with ice water. It calmed him down a little.)


( Jake was eagerly waiting for his friends to show up. Eventually they arrived at his apartment. And all three of them set off to the nearest bar.
They kept talking about all the fond memories they had together. Because of that, sadness was creeping up on them.
They were on the verge of drowning in thought and sorrow but luckily for them they had just arrived at the place where any kind of thought good or bad , would be forgotten and replaced with Nothingness...at least for a little while.
Although this couldn't be said for casey.

Casey had to drive'em back home so he couldn't really drink or as they like to call it ,  ""get shit faced"".

Inside, Jake saw a couple sitting together enjoying a few drinks , laughing and having a good time.
Jake could only smile for them, but deep down he was jealous.

His breakup with Katie was over three months ago. ""Coward"". That's what he called himself. 

""Did she really move on this quickly?"" 

Hal derailed Jake's train of pain by yelling at him to sit his ""pretty butt"" down. Jake follows orders incredibly well so he did.

They ordered the first set of drinks and a pop for casey.

They drank and drank. Casey was just watching them shitting on their faces...
While he couldn't. Petty.

They talked about all the cases they've been a part of and then they did more drinking.

Two shots turned into three and then somehow three turned into six... And then, six turned into eight.

"" Guys I forgot my wallet back home!."" Casey remembered.

"" It's (hiccup) on meeee..."" Hal said. 

"" No...No way I'll pay...it's on meee..."" Jake argued.)

H_ Fuck you looking at maan??(Hiccup) Do you want to eat me like a bug? 
( He drunkenly pointed at Casey)

J_ Yeeeah...eat him like a bug...I'd love to watch.

Ca_ What the fuck are you talking about?What's in these?

H_ C'mon, eaaat me like a buug...

Ca_ alright, time to go... y'all had your fun.

J_ No. I have something to sayy to that smug faced asshooole.

H_ Whoo?

J_ That guy oveer there... He is kissing Katie!. Son of a bitch...

Ca_ Oh no you don't!. Sit your ass down.here eat some peanuts.

H_ He's allergic!.

J_ No I'm not...liar.

Ca_ Is he?

H_ I don't know. How am I supposed to know?!

J_ I am not!.

Ca_ Ok!...ok...just stand up I'll hold your hands. We'll walk to the car.

H_ What about the dude who's kissing Katie?

Ca_ You guy's sit in the car and I'll go talk to him.

J_ What would I do without you?

( Casey held their hands like a parent and sat them down in the backseat.Then he took Jake's wallet with him and went back inside to pay.)

J_ did you beat his aaass?

Ca_ Yeah sure buddy I did.

J_ Thank you....( Then he passed out.)

( Hal farted. But Jake didn't notice. Hal was laying on Jake. Casey rolled down his window and drove to his place.

"" He still loves her , How am I going to tell him...""

Guilt overtook Casey's soul.)


( Out of curiosity Cole was studying Jake's resume.

He was the top of his class back in the academy and joined the agency because of his grandfather's war efforts. When he was only 22 he brought down bill harper. One of the biggest fraudsters to ever live. Well eventually he got out because of his connections but non the less, the kid had gathered enough evidence on him to lock him up for a few weeks.
""That's not nothing, especially for an agency kid"".cole thought to himself.
His arrest numbers were high. Highest than anybody else there. With a total of 84 through 2 years. Considering that most of them were fraudsters, he did really well.
Big names were listed there.)

C_ Maybe I was overreacting... the kid seems to be talented.

M_ Hey sarge , sorry for bothering you but Danny wanted to speak with you. He said it's urgent!.

C_ It's never you who bothers me moll. Is he in forensics?

M_ yeah.

( Cole stood up and left his room. He made his way downstairs and stood Infront of the door that read FORENSICS With bold red letters on it. He waited for a couple of seconds...
Danny should have let him in by now... 
He entered the code to the room on the side panel and it opened...
The room was dark.
Danny was there... 
laying on the floor with blood all around him...
Standing next to him , was a man holding a bloodied knife . He was scared.

"" DROP YOUR WEAPON AND GET ON YOUR KNEES!"" Cole drew his gun. 

The man did so as he asked. Cole went inside and got closer and closer to the killer he recognised him... The same coward he visited last night In the rain. Some other officers that were around followed cole inside and one of them cuffed the perp.

Danny wasn't fully dead yet and cole realised...

He went towards him. Right before life faded from his eyes he gurgled: "" Tell them...I forgive them.""

C_ What?No!. Danny stay with me! Medic... I need a medic!!!... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? ( He pointed towards the killer))


J_ Jesus...I feel horrible!...

H_ How much did we drink last night?

Ca_ You both had 8 shots in like 40 minutes...

J_ How aren't we dead?

Ca_ I don't know...

H_ Did we do or say anything weird?

Ca_ Well yeah. You wanted me to ""eat you like a bug"" and Jake wanted to beat up a guy.

J_ Did I?

Ca_ No , i stopped you.

H_ I'm gonna go wash off a little...

J_ And I'm going to a corner to die.

Ca_ But guys you didn't even touch your cereal!.
I think I have something that could possibly help with your hangover.

J_ Is it the salt thing again?

Ca_ yup.

H_ That doesn't help, it just adds more to the pain.

Ca_ Don't be a little baby just take a tiny sneef...
( He went inside his room to find it.)

H_ while he is gone, imma go take a shower. Enjoy the salt thing.

J_ I will brother. I sure will.

Ca_ Where did he go?

H_ I'm taking a shower!...( Hal screamed from the bathroom)

Ca_ Here ( he passed it to Jake.)

( Jake took the gentlest sneef ever and even then it still burned like a bitch.)

J_ God! Whoa!.

Ca_ Feeling better?

J_ Not really...no.

Ca_ Hey I wanted to talk to you about something.

J_ what is it man? (Sneef sneef)

Ca_ Last night you kept on calling for Katie in your sleep. And the guy I mentioned that you wanted to beat up, was because you thought he was kissing Katie...

J_ Dude , me and her are done. Drunk me is a few months behind...

Ca_ you were crying...well ,sobbing throughout the whole night.

J_ Trust me , sober me doesn't even think about her bro.

Ca_ You clearly still have feelings for her...

J_ No , I'm just...
I don't know...
I guess I'm trying to...

Ca_ Trying to what?

J_ Hmm? Trying to... let go...

Ca_ By shrieking her name all night long?

J_ I had to get it out of my system probably...

Ca_ uh huh...I don't want you to get hurt...she has a boyfriend now...

J_ That's great news!. ( no it's fucking not)
( So she wasn't lying earlier...she really did move on this quick.)

Ca_ I care about you man. You need to stop thinking about her and move on.

J_ How certain are you on the boyfriend thing?

Ca_ I...saw her...with another guy.

J_ Well I mean it's a free country maybe she was just talking to him or something...not every guy that talks to her is her boyfriend silly.

Ca_ Yeah well...they... were kissing. So...

J_ oh... french kissing or???

Ca_ JAKE IM SEEING HER OK?!

J_ What?

Ca_ Katie and I have been seeing eachother for a couple of weeks now...

J_ (You fucking homewrecker!) Oh...ok.

Ca_ I just don't want things to get weird...

J_ ( you made them wired asshole.)no no it's fine. Like I said I don't care anymore...( Fuck you.)

Ca_ So we cool?

J_ (Fuck) yeah(you)yeah(Fuck)of course (you).

Ca_ I'm so glad to hear it... If you want to talk with someone about this I'm your guy... And if you still like her just tell me...and I'll go away.

J_ ( say you like her , say you like her...) it's ok.
(Pussy...)

Ca_ Alright. When is your flight?

J_ tomorrow at 9 AM. 

Ca_ Katie's at the same time as well!. You know what? I'll drive you two there.

J_ No no thank you. I don't want to make things more awkward than it already is...

Ca_ I understand.

J_ Thanks for the cereal and the...salt.

Ca_ you're leaving? Wait a little bit for hal and then we'll leave together.

J_ nah I like to walk. Thanks.

Ca_ oh here is your wallet. I forgot mine and you offered to pay.

J_ of course I did... Say bye to hal for me.

H_ BYE...( He screamed)

J_ See you guys tomorrow at the airport. Bye for now.

Ca_ Bye man. And again I'm here for you don't you forget that.

J_ I won't.

( Jake put his earbuds on and listened to music while he was walking back home.

""Why did Katie lie about going out on the evening while Casey was with us?
It's probably because she doesn't like him...
Is she doing this so that she could get back at me? Or...is she cheating on Casey? Naah...she wouldn't do that."")


( Fluorescent lights above their heads twitching at times. With one giant see through mirror on the wall overshadowing them. The killer had no emotions on his face...he was numb. The walls were thin...he could over hear cole and Charlie arguing and grieving. He took a look at his hands. Blood. He has ascended. He made his god very happy.

""Answer me damnit!!!. Why did you murder him?"" The officer yelled...

He didn't say a word. He didn't budge. He just sat there focusing on one spot on the table.
It was a stain. Coffee maybe? He thought.
A stain like all of these worthless idiots running around all day not doing anything positive for anybody.)

C_ it's ok Hamish I'll take it from here. You can go.

H_ give him hell...
( He said to cole before leaving.)

C_ Terry was it?

T_...

C_ Terry Jackson. 23 years old. The son of Clarence Jackson. Top student in your college I see...what a shame. Do you have any idea who was the man you just slaughtered?...
28 STAB WOUNDS!!!. For the love of god... YOU ORPHANED THREE BOYS!.

I don't want to know why...

I want to know how...

T_...

( Cole puts away the tablet he was holding.)

C_ How you got out of your cell , how you got a knife and how you went inside his room...
Someone helped you. Someone who's here. An officer? A detective? A fucking bystander? Who?

T_ I had to do It. Now I am one of his children.
Now HE LOVES ME.

C_ Answer the fucking question!.

T_ The day shall come that all of you... especially you sergeant Frost...will pay. For it is because of your sacrifice that we will all ascend!. Till that day we shall all hail HERESY!!!
I have already played my part...
 now it's your turn.

( Tears of blood started coming out of Terry's eyes...blood that was like acid burning his face.
He was melting. He fell on the floor convulsing.

His plan didn't really work as he would have wanted...the tears eventually stopped. With his face completely gone he cursed Cole and everyone else in the building and got up. Then he proceeded to slam his face onto the table with so much force and speed...that his head was completely blown into pieces.
With the rest of the acidic blood coming out of the place where his neck bone should have been, and making a hole through the table.)



After saying his goodbyes to his director and leaving for the airport he felt a hole in his stomach. He was going to miss that building.
His desk underneath the AC. The coffee machines there. His friends and colleagues...
His director ,who to him was like a father. A father he never had. He arrived at the airport...
Hal , Casey and Katie were all already there.

From afar, he watched as Casey hugged and kissed Katie...
he waited for her to leave. Then he showed himself. Casey and hal had tears in their eyes saying goodbye to their friends. The thought of not seeing them everyday made their skin's crawl.

After receiving another suffocating bear hug he made his way through the terminal and eventually he got in the plane. Katie was a few sits behind him. 
""This is captain peralta speaking we are going to have a delightful flight to...."" 
Jake put on his earbuds and listened to his feelings.
Katie noticed him. He was right Infront of her but she couldn't see him...The man she loved wasn't there.
Jake was thinking about his future.
He felt happy, sad and hopeful.

A future that he had no idea what was holding for him... Holding for them.

I've seen some discussions about this from a few years ago where the Sweet Labs Cast v2 came highly recommended, and that's the one I will be getting, since it seemed to do well with both pourover and espresso. However, since placing the order last year my coffee consumption has shifted more towards espresso from pourover, and I'm open to adding more burrsets.

I’m not sure how to handle it - she’s moved away from her parents and myself several years ago, she lives in a small town about 30 minutes from a larger city near the beach (which she loves). She has a few friends but none very close personally to her. She goes on dates, but has not found anyone. Over the past year, I’ve noticed it’s become very difficult for her to do things she used to find easy (setting up a new tv, connecting to WiFi, putting together a coffee table), which fuels her frustration and anger. 

I’ve asked her to move closer to the bigger city where there is more opportunity to date and meet friends, but she refuses. She also refuses to move back to our state. I’ve visited her many times in the past, but taking regular trips isn’t always feasible due to work, money woes, and a recent surgery.

He said he thinks our DM would be okay as long as I can explain the parts of a shot. She came in today for their planning meeting. She asked if I did the tasting and I said “no I don’t like coffee so I wouldn’t be able to taste whether or not a shot is good quality if I don’t like it. However I pulled a shot from all the bars every type they all looked how they were supposed to and another barista tasted them to double check” and then I listed the parts of a shot and she was like okay. Turned to my SM and said they needed to take a look at the expectation. And it says everyone has to try it. And said “well she can just take a small sip”. Girl no matter how often I drink it, it will continue to taste like dirt to me (no offense to coffee drinkers it’s just not my thing).

This person is a friend of one of my relatives. She has known my relative for 15+ years, they get along well, but she is not a close friend. My relative is close friend of her mother and so that is the friendship they have. My relative is really close to her mother. So, I have known of her for a long time before I ever met her in 2014. When I met her she was a mom to toddler twins, she was with her spouse (who has passed away since) and I only saw her twice during this visit to my relative. I have been back various times to visit her and  have not seen her until recently. 

Back then when I met her, she was personable and laughs a lot. She is warm. 

Recently, we met again because I was in town and she invited me for coffee to catch up. I was pretty excited to see her again. She is such a lovely person and she laughs so much and is so smart and soulful. I found myself feeling attracted to her. I think it's something I felt back then when I met her and couldn't pursue since she was with someone and had young children. I never met her spouse. 

I know that after that trip, I went back home and got married because all of a sudden I wanted to have a wife and a family. I got married and got divorced. 

When we met for coffee, we ended up spending the entire afternoon together walking and talking. I didn't want that time with her to end. 

Point is that in her conversations she brings up her late spouse often. I think I remember that she casually did mention him back when we met--like he does this, he does that. It's been over 2 years since he passed away and I don't think that she dates. In the conversation, we connected because we both work and go back home. I told her this when we met again and her face brightened up and she said ""me too!"". She can talk while smiling. 

She is open about her struggle with grief and her depression. She told me that she feels so much better now. She also mentions her late spouse in past tense and present tense. 

I like her and I want to pursue her--but I don't know how to approach her. We didn't talk about our personal situations. She didn't ask me if I was dating anyone and I didn't ask her. I'm not sure how to stay in her life this time around or if she even wants me there. She seems to enjoy solitude. 

She feels comfortable around me too. I could tell she was really comfortable--I wonder if she felt that same connection or spark too. She talked about loyalty and that seems to be important to her as well. 

Does anyone have any advice? Other than flat out asking her (I think she would flat out turn me down if I just ask her). I feel like I will need to take my time with her and I wan to grow in her life. 

I am curious about her. I haven't felt like this in years. ",0,1738956046.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

TLDR - Eviva has gone downhill fast. Elevator issues, amenities not working or being removed altogether, and at least two move-outs every week. DO NOT SIGN HERE



This building seemed great at first, but it is quickly becoming worse by the day. This review will have three parts: broken building functions, amenities, and generally negative things.

**BROKEN BUILDING FUNCTIONS**

It is a 20-story building with two elevators, but one of the elevators is often reserved. There is a freight elevator, but it's been broken for at least a month. About a week before the freight elevator broke, one of the other elevators was fixed after being broken for about six months. Maybe elevator problems make you want to take the stairs? Too bad. All the stairwells are locked from the inside, so you can only exit on the 1st floor.

The front door is broken. The key reader works about half the time. When it doesn't work, the concierge has to let you in. It's not a big deal unless the concierge has to go do a different part of their job that isn't in the lobby. Then you're stuck outside until they come back.

The accessible door buttons don't work. If you can't power your way through a broken power door, then you're kinda screwed. FYI, the power door not functioning actually adds resistance to the door, so it seems even heavier than it is.

Lastly, the hot water is spotty here. I wouldn't be that mad about it if utilities weren't $300 a month for a studio. The upper 8 or 10 floors were out of hot water pretty consistently for several weeks. Eviva gave no solution or rent credit. Eviva didn't seem to do anything until residents started contacting the city.

**AMENITIES**

Valet trash has become more of an inconvenience than an amenity because people have to take one of the two working elevators to pick up trash. They often won't pick up trash for ridiculous reasons. My trash was left once because the bag was ripped, but THEY RIPPED IT.

Another amenity that's just for show is the coffee machine in the lobby. It's closed most of the time. You can get coffee probably three days out of the week and before 3 p.m. only.

When I first moved in, the TVs in the lounge didn't work for nine months. While touring, I didn't notice because they were on and working but not connected to anything.

**GENERAL ISSUES**

Utilities are a problem that I can't prove, but I will mention them. My monthly utilities in a 490 sqft studio are $300 or more. According to residents who have lived in Eviva for multiple years, utilities have tripled. Also, several of my neighbors and I have been setting our thermostats, and the temperature doesn't change. This leads me to believe that the building is actually controlling unit temperatures or at least setting limits that residents aren't made aware of.

Parking. Eviva has virtually no parking enforcement, so there are often more cars in the garage than in the spaces. This is extra ridiculous because unreserved parking is $100 per month. Reserved parking is even more expensive, but paying for a reserved spot means pretty much nothing since there is no parking enforcement.

Package Room. Eviva has 20 floors and at least 15 units per floor, which is 300 units. There are 100 package slots in the package room, so most packages line the floor and shelves unprotected. In case you were wondering, there have been stolen packages. By the way, this package room is a service you pay for.

Lastly, printing used to be free. It is now paid. Fine, this is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I only bring it up because a paid service is NOT an amenity.

**GOOD THINGS**

So that everyone knows, I'm not just biased and jaded; I'll mention some positives. The apartments are beautiful. The price for square footage is high, but they are pretty.

The concierge team is amazing. They are some of the nicest people and very helpful.

The location is prime. It's directly behind the Denver Art Museum and a close walk to many restaurants and bars.

The best part of living at Eviva has been my neighbors. They have been the most enjoyable neighbors I've ever had. Unfortunately, all the neighbors I communicate with have plans to leave Eviva, just like me, so I guess I like the neighbors for now.



If you read this entire review, I hope you gained some information to help you make a decision on this building. Good luck and happy apartment hunting.

1ik33g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heat/comments/1ik33g7/an_open_letter_to_jimmy_butler/,An Open Letter to Jimmy Butler,"Jimmy,

I will always be grateful for the time you were on the Miami Heat. But its crazy how so many amazing years were drastically changed by a few really messed up weeks.  You recently stated that you wanted the Miami Heat to be *your* team. When  you first joined the heat, you said that you loved what Wade had here and you wanted to experience the same feeling. 

Wade didn’t just *get* the title of *Heat Lifer* or *Face of the Franchise* because he wanted it. He earned it with sacrifice, selflessness, and leadership that extended far beyond his on-court performances. He took pay cuts to bring in teammates, put winning above personal gain, and never acted entitled to the throne. He didn’t have to *tell* people Miami was his team—it just was.

You, on the other hand? You wanted Miami to be *your* team while making choices that hurt the franchise. You can’t *have the team* if you’re a terrible leader, taking actions that had a *massively negative impact* on the organization as a whole. That’s not leadership—that’s being a *diva.*

A true leader would have taken Riley's comments last summer as motivation and put in the work—*earned* that next payday. After all, you had already agreed to play this season for the contract you signed. If you were in Riley’s position, you wouldn’t have given an extension to a player in your exact situation.

And the worst part? You completely neglected the very fans who stood by you.

Through all the drama, all the teams you burned in the past, we had your back. Heat fans welcomed you like a *Heat Lifer*, defended you when Philly called you selfish, stood by you when Minnesota labeled you toxic, and believed in you when people said you’d never lead a team anywhere. We rocked your jersey, we chanted your name, and we embraced you like one of our own.

And how did you repay us? With selfishness. With drama. And when you finally left, your *one regret* wasn’t how you let down the fans, how you mishandled the situation, or how you turned your back on those who supported you—it was *your coffee shop.* That’s what you cared about most? Not the fans who stood in your corner? Not the people who defended you when the rest of the league called you a problem? Not missing your ""brothers""? Nothing about the accomplishments here together?

And now? You’re gone. Traded to the Warriors. And the irony? You left Miami claiming you wanted *your own team*—only to join a franchise that already has a leader. Actually, it has *two*: Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. So now, instead of being “the guy,” you’re third in line. How did that help you? It didn’t. But it *did* get you paid. And let’s be real—that’s what you wanted all along.

At the end of the day, Jimmy, you only cared about *Jimmy.* And that’s why the Heat will move forward without you—just like they always do.

Sincerely,  
A Heat Fan",0,1738955754.0,heat,10,0.41,False

It’s not the jitter before a presentation or the flush of embarrassment when you spill coffee on your shirt. It’s the kind of fear that rewires your life—skipped parties, rejected promotions, friendships left unmade because your brain insists the stakes are apocalyptic. And here’s the thing no one tells you: it’s treatable. Not manageable, not tolerable—treatable.

I reviewed some studies. I've always wanted to know what actually helps, not just what pretends to help. The evidence is clear.

**Therapy Works? The Worst Thing You Could Tell Me**

Yes, therapy helps. I know. It's cruel. Talking to a stranger intimately is the cure to social anxiety? *What kind of fucked up monkey's paw wish is that?*

Let’s talk about evidence and why I believe it works.

A network meta-analysis of 101 clinical trials involving 13,164 adults with social anxiety disorder did the heavy lifting for us (Mayo-Wilson et al., 2014). Think of it as a scientific cage match: psychological therapies, pills, self-help books, and placebos thrown into the ring. The winner? Individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Not just effective, but staggeringly so, with effect sizes leaving even the best medications in the dust (SMD -1.19, CrI -1.56 to -0.81). For context, an SMD of -0.8 is considered a “large” effect. CBT isn’t just large; it’s a wrecking ball.

Here’s why: CBT doesn’t ask you to swallow a pill or recite affirmations. It teaches you to dismantle the scaffolding of your anxiety—the catastrophic predictions (“They’ll laugh”), the avoidance (“I’ll just stay home”), the post-mortem self-flagellation (“I sounded so stupid”). It’s surgery for the mind, and unlike medication, the results stick. Long after the sessions end, the rewired circuits stay rewired.

Now, here’s the part you might want to sit down for: most therapies don’t work. Or at least, not nearly as well as CBT. Psychodynamic therapy? Mindfulness? The data’s lukewarm. Even group CBT, while decent (-0.92 SMD), lags behind its one-on-one counterpart. And benzos? Sure, they’ll calm you (SMD -0.96), but they’re the equivalent of pouring concrete over your anxiety—effective until it cracks. In fact, let's talk about medications.

**The Effectiveness of Social Anxiety Medications**

Let’s talk about pills. Not the kind that solve everything, but the kind that \*might\* make standing in a grocery checkout line or giving a toast at a wedding feel less like a high-wire act. Social anxiety medications fall into four main categories, each with its own trade-offs:

*SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil)*

These are the workhorses. They boost serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, and studies show they reduce symptoms in about 60-70% of patients. The catch? They take weeks to work, and side effects—nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction—can feel like a tax on your sanity before relief kicks in. A 2022 meta-analysis of 33 trials confirmed their effectiveness, but also noted that 1 in 4 people quit them early, often because the upfront cost (literal and metaphorical) feels too steep (Mitsui et al., 2022).

*SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta)*

These target serotonin \*and\* norepinephrine, a chemical linked to alertness. They’re similarly effective to SSRIs but come with a bonus feature: slightly more energy (Mitsui et al., 2022). The downside? Slightly more side effects too—sweating, dizziness, constipation (Bruce & Saeed, 1999).

*Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin)*

The quick fix. These calm you within minutes by slowing down your brain’s panic signals. Problem is, they’re habit-forming, and tolerance builds fast. They’re the emergency exit, not the staircase. Most doctors limit them to short-term use or severe cases (Williams et al., 2017), like if you’re white-knuckling through a job interview or your sister’s wedding.

*Beta-Blockers (Propranolol)*

Here’s the outlier. Beta-blockers don’t touch your brain chemistry; they block adrenaline’s effects on your body. No racing heart, no shaking hands, no voice cracks. For situational anxiety—public speaking, first dates, presentations—they’re a revelation. You still \*feel\* nervous, but your body doesn’t betray you, which ironically makes the mental part quieter. Studies call them “moderately effective,” (Mitsui et al., 2022) but that undersells their niche: they break the cycle where physical symptoms fuel mental panic, which fuels more physical symptoms. They’re the only drug I’ve tried that worked consistently, precisely because they don’t try to fix you—they fix the feedback loop.

\---

**Why No One Takes the Pills (Even When They Should)**

Cost, fear, stigma. SSRIs and SNRIs require a 3-6 month commitment to see results, and many people quit in the “awkward phase” when side effects outpace benefits (Williams et al., 2017). Benzodiazepines scare people with their addiction potential (fair). Beta-blockers, though safer, aren’t even on some doctors’ radars—they’re seen as “heart medications,” not anxiety tools.

But by far the biggest reason and what prevented me from getting help is just making the phone call and showing up.

**A Practical Workaround**

Bring someone. A friend, a partner, anyone who can book the appointment for you, drive you there, and nod when you freeze up explaining why you came. It’s not weak to need backup; it’s strategy. Anxiety thrives on isolation, so outsource the logistics you hate. The goal isn’t to be brave—it’s to be practical.

Medications won’t make you love parties or turn you into a stand-up comic. But they might make the gap between “I can’t” and “I did” feel a little smaller. And sometimes, smaller is enough.

\---

**Why You Should Read This**

Here’s the part I almost didn’t write: Social anxiety stole years from me. Years of not dating, not seeing my family, not walking into a grocery store without rehearsing the interaction with the cashier like it’s Shakespeare. It made calling in sick to meetings a habit—I’ve missed more days to dread than to flu. Let me tell you, nothing makes you feel like a ghost quite than standing in your own kitchen, paralyzed by the prospect of a phone call to order pizza.

But here’s the other part: I tried exposure therapy. Not because I’m brave, but because I was desperate. My therapist—a woman with the patience of a saint and the humor of a late-night bartender—made me do things like read my grocery list aloud in a park. It felt stupid. It was stupid. But somewhere between the third and fourth time pretending to debate cereal brands with a squirrel, something shifted.

I also took propranolol. Not every day, just for the big stuff—speeches, TV interviews, parent-teacher conferences. The first time I spoke on live TV, my mom called afterward and said, “I didn’t know you could do that.” I said, “Me either.” She paused, then asked if I’d been replaced by a government clone. I told her clones don’t forget to return Tupperware, which seemed to convince her.

Now, I run a nonprofit. I coach basketball. I’ve stood in front of crowds and argued for school lunch debt relief without vomiting or fainting. The other day, I went to the store without drafting a script. Just walked in, grabbed milk, and left. It was so normal it felt like a miracle.

The point is: it’s possible to get better. Not fixed, not cured, but better. You’re not alone. And the work—the therapy, the pills, the awkward park rehearsals—is worth it. Because being around people isn’t just a requirement for staying alive; it’s where the joy is. The messy, loud, unscripted joy.

I hope this helps. I hope you know that even if your brain screams otherwise, nothing can stop you from trying. And trying, it turns out, is enough.

My first real cigar—a spur-of-the-moment indulgence— was more than just ephemeral tendrils dissolving into the darkness. It marked the inception of a journey I hadn’t anticipated but have come to savor with every deliberate draw, each puff revealing lessons cloaked in mystery and embers.

Fast forward a month, and here I am—building a collection, accumulating experiences, and discovering that cigars are not just objects of fleeting pleasure but stories waiting to be unraveled in smoke and ash. I thought it might be fun to share my journey with you all.

 

**My Cigar Collection: One Month In**

Made a mistake removing the sticker from my *Davidoff Mini Gold* and left it scarred, as seen in the picture. These stickers are quite annoying to deal with. As for the tin containers, I remove each stick individually and store them in my humidor with the cellophane intact.

To preserve and celebrate these experiences, I built a custom website—a digital journal where each smoke is logged alongside tasting notes and reflections. It’s become a ritual, a way to relive each moment through words.

Of course, winter in Sweden isn’t always ideal for leisurely smokes. That’s where cigarillos come in—quick smokes perfect for chilly weather.

 

**Cigarillos That I've Smoked So Far**

·         Macanudo Café Ascot

·         Arturo Fuente Cubanitos

·         Cohiba Club

·         Romeo y Julieta Mini

·         Davidoff Mini Nicaragua

·         Davidoff Mini Gold

 

As a lifelong non-smoker, I was unprepared for the symphony of flavors hidden within each cigar. I had expected monotony but was captivated by complexity. The burn transformed simple tobacco leaves into evolving narratives—leather, spice, cocoa, cedar—each note surfacing and retreating like waves.

Through trial and error, I discovered the art of swirling smoke in my mouth and gently exhaling through my nose, unlocking hidden layers of flavor. Each cigar became a meditation on patience, craftsmanship, and the beauty of presence.

Pairing cigars with the right drink quickly became a favored ritual—whether it was a rich whisky, smooth cognac, or even a soda to balance nicotine’s strength. A glass of water remained a faithful companion, cleansing the palate and tempering the smoke’s heat.

 

**Thoughts On Cigarillos**

These were decent for quick smokes during Sweden's winter months but pale in comparison to a proper cigar:

·         **Macanudo Café Ascot:** Smooth, mild.

·         **Arturo Fuente Cubanitos:** Surprisingly flavorful for its diminutive size.

·         **Cohiba Club & Romeo y Julieta Mini:** While convenient, the lack of craftsmanship due to them being machine-made left little to savor beyond a fleeting, papery smoke.

·         **Davidoff Mini Nicaragua:** A delightful pairing with morning coffee.

Even so, there’s something charming about grabbing a cigarillo or two for a brisk evening stroll—a fleeting moment of warmth against the chill.

 

**Cigar Accessories I've Bought So Far**

**Lighters:**

·         **JetLine JetMaster:** Great for outdoor use and easy to carry around.

·         **S.T. Dupont Ligne 2:** Special occasions; beautiful craftsmanship, used for indoors or when weather allows it.

Soft flame lighters are my preference whenever possible. There's something meditative about gently roasting the cigar's foot without touching it directly to the flame—slowly rotating and softly blowing on the ember until it glows evenly. This gentle approach often yields a beautifully uniform burn, perfect for that first flavorful puff.

While jet lighters are fast and practical outdoors, their intense heat demands careful distance and control to avoid scorching the foot, which can compromise the flavor.

 

**Cutters:**

·         **Xikar MTX Multi Tool:** Versatile, handy for bleeding lighters.

·         **Xikar Xi1:** Precise cuts; solid feel.

·         **Colibri V-Cut:** Yet to try, but seems promising for deeper cuts.

·         **Passatore Punch Duo:** Compact and convenient, it fits perfectly on my keychain, making it easy to carry wherever I go. I primarily use it for cigars with larger ring gauges.

The Xikar Xi1 stands out for its precise, clean cuts and solid craftsmanship. It’s leagues above the budget guillotine cutter I started with, which often left loose tobacco on my tongue after uneven cuts. With the Xi1, every draw begins smoothly, elevating the entire smoking experience.

**Storage:**

Currently using three *Boveda One-Year Bags* (with 65% packs for Cubans and 69% for non-Cubans). I haven’t decided on a permanent humidor yet but am leaning toward either a simple yet practical tupperdor or an elegant wooden humidor for display in my living room.

**Monitoring:**

I picked up a few *Cigar Oasis Caliber 4R* hygrometers. While I hear hygrometers aren’t perfectly reliable, I thought they might help spot deviations and measure temperature during Sweden’s summer months. I calibrated them by placing them inside a *Boveda One-Step Calibration Kit*, which—while convenient—feels a bit overpriced.

 

**Here’s what I’ve learned after chatting with more experienced cigar enthusiasts:**

·         Hygrometers tend to be imprecise, even digital ones.

·         They measure air humidity, not the cigars themselves.

·         Reliable humidity tools are quite costly.

 

Despite this, I still decided to get a few *Cigar Oasis Caliber 4R* just in case. They aren’t that costly and can still be useful for spotting deviations early or monitoring temperature during hot summer days. Otherwise, I trust my Boveda bags to do their job. Occasionally, I do a thorough check by gently pinching the cigars and ensuring the Boveda packs are still soft.

 

**Final Thoughts & Questions:**

Every smoke has taught me something—about patience, craftsmanship, and even myself. I’m reminded that cigars, like life, are best enjoyed slowly, savoring each moment. This community has been a huge help as I’ve started my journey, so thank you!

What are you currently smoking? Any must-try recommendations for my next journey? Also, any tips for selecting a humidor as a beginner?

Thanks for reading through my ramblings—hope you’re enjoying life with a great cigar by your side!

I apologized and told her I'd just send him the money back but I was uncomfortable and knew I wouldn't want to stay there.

1ik2vpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ik2vpg/venting_about_my_bday_trip/,Venting about my bday trip,"I booked and paid for a trip to NYC for 2 nights. 
My partner & I have already been (separately) and seen all the sights (except Statue of Liberty, it was foggy last time) so the main goal of this trip was to shop, eat & enjoy the city for my 30th. 
I only made a reservation for ONE thing, the jellycat diner, and it was made a month in advance. Soooo the day comes for my reservation.. it’s at 1:30…. Mind you… I go out at 8 am and get croissants and come back to wake my partner. He does not get out of bed or eat the muffin until I mention that… heeyyyy it’s 10:30 now, you still need to shower and we need to walk 20 mins…. & I was hoping to get out & do things before other things before noon. So he storms out of bed and slams himself in the shower. Okay, sure maybe I shouldn’t have said that, but if I didn’t he would have sat there until it was too late to go, this is how he works. I even told him that he KNEW what time this was at.. so why is he not ready to go?? After his shower idk what’s going on in the bathroom, but he somehow breaks the shower curtain off and is slamming more things now, because he’s mad he broke something. Completely ruins the whole day, pouts and cries while walking to my reservation & doesn’t even record me as planned. Doesn’t even speak to me, just walks behind me. I may as well have been alone!! I feel so disprestpected. So I go get coffee & slice pizza after the jellycat thing & he refuses my offer of food and warm coffee… he has not eaten… I know he’s hungry. He is sooo bitchy when he doesn’t eat, so I said to him OK you’re really gonna not drink the coffee and just starve yourself?? Cause that’s gonna make you  feel any better?? You’re going to be worse! Doesn’t say anything go back to Airbnb until 3 pm, still not speaking to me, he napped. So I get ready to go get food again and to take the free ferry to see the Statue of Liberty. So I say pls come with me, don’t really wanna go alone. I know you don’t want to be here for whatever reason, but I feel like if I was taken out on a paid for trip for someone’s bday, I’d at least fake it for them!! Maybe  I’m wrong to say that, but I’m very blunt. I do not have time to be wasted!! So anyways he freaks out after that and it takes and 4 hours to get him outta the house after that… we enjoyed time square & he was happy he came. But like wtf dude. The same thing happened the next day. Is he dealing with mental health?? Does he not want to be with me? Like I can’t understand this! But we could have done so much more had he not been stuck in his head :/  I do sound like a dick, but I’ve been putting up with this, so now I’m just blunt with it because I’m sick of it.

I typically order 3-4 8-12oz bags at a time to avoid shipping and get a good sense of each roaster I try.  

Issue is, I typically drink only 30-40g coffee a day. One bag may take me a couple weeks to get through, longer if I’m traveling. I usually work through one bag at a time. I’ve had roasters tell me that a bag should be consumed within two weeks of opening. If this can’t be accomplished, freeze the coffee. I’ve heard mixed reviews on freezing coffee and the 2 week consumption advice.

To those who also order in bulk - how do you keep coffee at its peak freshness while you work through the bags over time? What are best practices here?

The relationship lasted 3 years, but he was very abusive, mentally and also physically (choked me, beat me, slapped me with things, etc.). After the relationship I was really broken as a person and I went to therapy. I am still in therapy and tbh, I feel like I processed everything and feel a lot better, compared to last year. 

I started dating a guy (M27) in November. We met and we really hit it off. After that I had to do an intership in another City for 2 months and we kept in contact everyday. Since he travels a lot for work, he visited the City where I did my internship 2 times and 1 Weekend I was in the City where he (and me usually too) live. He is a really good guy and treats me well, is really thoughful, he also gave me small christmas gifts.  December was really stressful for me and I wasnt good mentally (it was University related, I am a Student). He was there for me and he actually really helped me and calmed me down. I was really thankful. I also know that he wants to be in a relationship with me, because he asked me. I said its too early for me since we only knew each other 2 months at this point.

I finished the internship and went back to the City I and he also live. Since he is away for work every monday-thursday, we only see each other on the weekend. 

So now here is the Problem, when I came back I noticed that he isn‘t really able to communicate properly in conflict situations and just shuts down. And with shutting down, I mean he just doesnt say a word and looks at the ground till I ask him why don’t you say anything because I just found it really weird. Also it triggered me a lot to be „ignored“ and he didnt communicate at all in this situation (it was also just a small disagreement, not even worth mentioning). He says that he just doesnt know what to say and that it’s a problem he has been working on. He also cried because he said he is afraid of loosing me. So I kinda felt bad for him and comforted him. 

This was last Weekend, and since then I am having doubts about this. He treats me really well but I just cannot be with someone who isnt able to communicate properly. He really behaved like a child in this Situation and tbh I was really shocked it turned me off. Also I don’t really feel a spark with him, but I just thought that it’s too early for that and it needs time. 
On the other hand, he says he is aware of this problem and working on it. Also I am thinking that noone is perfect and there will always be something that doesnt match 100%. So maybe I am just too harsh and shouldnt give up, just because 1 thing is not the way I would want it to be?

I don’t know, right now, I kinda wanna end it with him, but maybe it is just because of my abusive past experience that I am running away over this 1 thing to protect myself? Or is it valid? 
I mean I do really like him and he is really calm and treats me well. And tbh, he has a lot of things that I always wanted in a partner, that my ex didn‘t. Also we share the same values and plans for the future, and the physical aspects (kissing etc.) also matches well. But yeah, this situation last week just really made me take 2 Steps back and I just don’t want to pursue this anymore. I also kinda ignored him the whole week and he asked me yesterday if I wanna get Coffee tomorrow. I am thinking about ending it tomorrow then, but yeah I am unsere, so I really like to hear your opinions.

I'm single and a remote worker doing pretty decent good wise so it's a pretty nice setup living here now. But to actually buy and settle down and raise a family here, I don't know. The landlord just asked the other day if I'd be interested in buying at some point in a couple years so the where do I want to live for real question has reared it's head again.

There's a couple things I like SLV. It still has that culture and charm that Taos has with the history, friendliness, way out of the box creativity. That feeling of being in this other world as soon as you cross La Veta is something special! Also I like that there is a little more agriculture besides hobby farms and it seems like a place with more potential to blossom because there isn't a only one in the nation type of thing that's trying to get preserved. I could handle a little colder weather. I'd have like 450-700K for a budget. I'd like the San Juans more than the Sangre's cause they are less steep and more useable and a lil wetter. But I really don't know what life in Del Norte or La Jara is like day to day? I know Chaffee county pretty well and that was always an option (though $$$$). Pagosa I've been some but a little less familiar. Problem with that is it's a dang long drive for going to the Springs and back, especially with Wolf Creek Pass in the winter.

I've always considered Canon City to only spot I'd consider on the Front Range. But I'm not too familiar with the town vibe, who shows up at the local coffee shop, what the saturday evening events are like etc. There's nothing in the northern half of the state that hits the criteria cause it all funnels through Denver and I don't want to deal with that.

I do like Seco / Taos but the thing that keeps me questioning the long term viability of the place is how cemented, resistant to change, and slow moving this place is. They're still finishing building the Big R or whatever that was almost finished when I moved here. There's main street that's been under construction since pre columbus basically. I love the artistic energy and the eye opening conversations that always happen here, but will I be regretting it actually trying to sink a family into somewhere that's so unable to update? And it's not getting any cheaper - even on a good salary a 4-5 bed house is egregious. As far as large scale developments, they scrapped the more normal development and now there's the earthship dude looking at it for like a 90 unit development... things like that make me wonder if this the right spot when I'm not just a no stings single guy.

The family is all in Colorado Springs and I grew up there - so the SLV would be even closer to them. I didn't pick it initially because Alamosa isn't the best location in the valley nature wise and I wasn't sure how single life would be. But if I was married with a family, I'd be ok with 50% less action than Taos has, Taos has already has more than I can do as a pretty out and about single person.",1,1738954853.0,movingtoColorado,0,1.0,False

I’ve definitely got tasty pour overs from them—super vibrant and juicy —but espresso has me stumped.



**My Gear:**

• Gaggia Classic Pro + Gaggiuino mod (similar to a Decent)

• DF64 Gen 2 with SSP HU burrs (which already tends to produce fast-flowing shots)



**What I've noticed:**

• Hard to get anywhere near 9 bar without harsh bitterness.

• Blooming shots (what I like to do for light roasts) don't seem to work — I don't think there's enough resistance in the ground coffee for the two pressure peaks. By the time I get to the second peak, a lot of coffee has been brewed and there's little resistance left in the puck.

• My shot times hover around 15–18 seconds.

• The flavor is either primarily acidic or bitter (depending on grind size and yield). It's always pretty thin body-wise. Almost no sweetness.



**Beans Tried:**

• September Coffee Rainbow Cocktail (amazing as a pour over)

• Black & White Thermal Shock Decaf

• Both rested 2–3 weeks, but still tricky in espresso form.



**What seems to work better:**

• **Lower Pressure** (\~6–7 bar max).

• **Slightly Cooler Temps** (90°C). I should probably try going even lower.

I tried some therapy (not speech, doesn’t work for me) for some time but my heart wasn’t in it. I find it extremely hard to take care of myself considering I have no one to really take care of myself for or to have social interaction with. 

This was until I just had some sort of epiphany where I realized I’m genuinely going to be alone my entire life if I keep living the way I do. There is a scene in one of my favorite TV shows Mr. Robot where the main character says in a therapy session “I want a way out of loneliness”, this combined with people also calling me the introverted version of Gregory House (From House MD), I knew I just had to change. So I signed back up for therapy sessions 

So for the actually story: I went out shopping at Costco today because I needed to pick things up for my family, I was waiting for my food and seen someone fairly cute and I didn’t say anything as usual. Couple glances back and forth, nothing special. I sit down to eat my food and she sits at the table next to me, I’m thinking “Fuck, if I wasn’t eating maybe I would say something”. Halfway through she gets up and leaves, I call myself a failure saying I should have said something. For the first time in my life, I wrap up my food and basically jog to the exit where there’s people in line. She goes the same way I came, and her car is almost perpendicular to mine. I go to put my cart away, and feelings of trepidation come back. I didn’t say anything. I once again feel terrible, I then see that she has a big ass box of cat litter she might need help with so when she gets to it, I act like I’m walking past and say 

“Hey do you need help with that” 

She obliges and I pick it up saying I know how heavy they are from being a stocker. I then say I seen her in the store and complimented her on her hair and ask where she’s from. The conversation didn’t really go anywhere and in hindsight I realize how weird it is approaching a woman by herself in the parking lot even if it’s crowded. I then said apologized and said, I’m sorry if this is a little awkward, I just wanted to talk to you because I thought you were cute, I’m working on my anxiety and I’m pretty bad with talking to people. She said “you’re perfectly fine and gave me a smile”, I then asked her if she wanted to grab coffee one time and she replied with saying she has a boyfriend. I say “Oh I’m sorry!” And tell her to have a nice day and she replies the same back. 

I realize I could have done a much better job, but that was never the goal. The goal was actually talking to someone. My heart was racing afterwards and I celebrated and honestly cried a little in my car, knowing that if I could do it once, I can do it again. 

The saying goes “If it bleeds, you can kill it” and I certainly did that today. I have a meeting for my anxiety in 25 minutes and can’t wait to share this story with my group as well. ",12,1738954415.0,Stutter,2,0.93,False

I am really lonely, this year and last year is the closest I have gotten to thinking about ways out. Before I could have these thoughts but never thought about methods. 

I have a therapist but I have told her about these thoughts, the closest I have said is I don’t want to say out loud how I feel every morning she was taken back by this but didn’t push me to talk about it, she knows I don’t open up easily. She was surprised I booked a session, I am not sure why that is tbh, she has never said something like this to me, I admitted that I wasn’t sure about the session and at the end she did say she was glad that I came and said I could contact her between session but last time I contacted her about something she ignored me and then she was like oh let me send you voice note after like 3 days, and I said whatever I messaged about is sorted, it did leave a bad taste and I was sure continuing after that and she did also completely forgot about our session after that and then messaged me saying she mixed up the times. 


I am jobless right now which is the main reason why I’m struggling so much and having to be around my family too much who are constantly being negative towards, belittling me. I’m not speaking to my mum. She hasn’t even tried to apologise or even engage in conversation with me. Because of the disrespect from her I have been skipping night meals- I know I’m only hurting myself doing this. 

I am applying for a job but even with job I always think what am I working towards for? I have no purpose in life. My own mother tells me she regrets having me. I asked multiple times if my friends can hang out, one friend made plans with me multiple times, let’s go x place on this weekend, weekend comes and the plan doesn’t happen this has happened multiple times. The other friend who is bff can’t hang out with me, there is simply not enough time for me. I get you have a bf and you are getting married whatever, we could literally grab a fucking coffee. 

Her wedding is in September so I will have to be there for that. My ex gf doesn’t give a fuck about me which is so fun, lovebombed me and then disappeared. 

My therapist knows I’m lonely, she said last session that I cannot connect with other because I don’t know myself, she said I need to check in with myself, validate my emotions, that I’m giving off unconfident vibe and people pick up on it. She said if you can’t connect with yourself how do you expect others to connect with you? I told her that made me feel more lost and don’t understand what she means, I said something like what more there is to understand about myself? She was all about harsh truth this session, honesty I don’t know what she means by check in with myself.

my parents were shit at parenting. they were abusive and while my memories are mostly repressed, i remember them denying me food when i’d ’misbehaved’. i was a fucking kid lol but it didn’t stop them from denying me food and love, as well as all of the other shit they pulled

i lowkey feel like i was set up to fail from the start. when they gave up on starving me and moved onto other shitty discipline methods they finally gave me access to the fridge and let me eat

but i was done fucked up because i was permanently starving and never learned wtf hunger cues were. i ate and ate for years until i was overweight as an early teenager. cue bullying from my mom about how i was a fat bitch and not her daughter. then i learned about the existence of the anorexia community on tumblr..

i won’t go into more detail but the from then on to the present, my life has just been a series of binge and restrict cycles. i am now an adult and still don’t know how to fucking eat, because why would i? nobody ever showed me how to. i live off iced coffee and chocolate because they never made me eat healthy foods either and now im scared to try them

either i fast or eat the entire kitchen. i weigh >!82lbs!< right now so i should be happy because im skinny. but no, i’m still miserable. i was this miserable when i was overweight too. i’ve never been happy with my body, whether i was higher or lower than my current weight. i still wear XL clothes bc i’m insecure lols

i’m drained and exhausted from restricting and being at a low weight but does the eating disorder give a fuck? no! spoiler alert i still feel miserable in my body even though i know i look good  because it’s never enough 

a lifetime of bad eating habits has left me into a hot mess of a girl. i can’t begin to heal because i don’t know what the fuck normal eating habits are like. i’ll always equate my self worth to my weight. i’ll never be able to truly enjoy life because my illness is in the back of my mind. i can never recover truly because without my eating disorder i’ll never feel like a person. i don’t know what it’s like to not obsess over food 

to make it worse my eating disorder ties into with the daddy issues i have that come with having a dad who hated you and being tiny makes me feel like i deserve love and care. all i crave is love dude like. and i feel like i don’t deserve it unless i’m pretty and skinny.

1ik2cxm,https://i.redd.it/mqlo9jqsirhe1.gif,The Pull of the Future: Reclaiming Your Focus • [Click to Expand],"### Have you ever been so excited or anxious about something in the near future that it completely consumes your thoughts? 

Maybe it's the anticipation of a package you've been eagerly waiting for—the one you refresh the tracking page every hour. Or perhaps it's the countdown to your birthday, imagining how you'll celebrate and what surprises might be in store.

It could also be that thrilling day you're leaving for vacation, picturing yourself on the beach or exploring a new city, so much so that you're mentally already there. Maybe it's that weekend you've planned to shop for a brand-new car, envisioning yourself behind the wheel of your dream ride. Or perhaps it's a lunch or dinner date you've scheduled with someone special, rehearsing conversations in your head and wondering how it will go.

In all these moments, you find yourself so preoccupied with what's coming that you struggle to focus on what actually needs to get done right now. The laundry piles up, work deadlines creep closer, errands remain unfinished—and yet, your mind keeps wandering back to the future event, leaving today's tasks neglected.

## Regaining Focus: A Simple Reminder

One way to ease your anxiety about an upcoming event and regain your focus is to gently remind yourself: *""Stop. The day will come—it always does. But right now, I need to focus on what I can do today.""*

By grounding yourself in the present moment and shifting your attention to what needs your energy now, you can make the most of today while still looking forward to what’s ahead.

### Why This Works:

1.  **Breaking the Cycle of Anticipation:** When you're anxiously waiting for something, your mind tends to spiral into repetitive thoughts about the future—what will happen, how it will feel, or whether things will go as planned. This creates a mental loop that distracts you from the present. By consciously interrupting this cycle with a deliberate pause (*""Stop. The day will come.""*), you redirect your thoughts away from the future and back to the here and now.
2.  **Reassurance Through Certainty:** The phrase *""The day will come—it always does""* provides a sense of certainty and reassurance. It reminds you that time moves forward no matter what, and the event you're anticipating is inevitable. This helps reduce the urgency and pressure you feel to mentally ""live in the future,"" allowing you to relax and trust that things will unfold in their own time.
3.  **Focusing on What You Can Control:** Anxiety often stems from focusing on things outside your control (like when a package will arrive or how an event will turn out). By shifting your attention to what you *can* control—your actions today—you empower yourself to take charge of your time and energy rather than letting them be consumed by worry.
4.  **Mindfulness and Productivity:** Grounding yourself in the present moment helps you practice mindfulness, which has been shown to reduce stress and improve focus. When you're fully engaged with what you're doing now, you're more productive, effective, and satisfied with your day.

### Why It’s Important Not to Waste Each Day While Waiting:

1.  **Time is Irreplaceable:** Every day is a gift that can never be reclaimed once it's gone. Wasting today by obsessing over tomorrow means missing out on opportunities for growth, connection, or enjoyment that are available right now.
2.  **Building Momentum:** The actions you take today lay the foundation for future success. For example, if you're waiting for a job interview, using today to prepare (researching the company, practicing answers) can increase your confidence when the big day arrives. If you're waiting for a vacation, finishing tasks now ensures you'll leave with peace of mind.
3.  **Reducing Regret:** Looking back on wasted days often leads to regret—wishing you had accomplished more or spent your time differently. By staying focused on the present, you can avoid this feeling and create a sense of accomplishment instead.
4.  **Enjoying Life in the Moment:** Life isn't just about big events; it's made up of small moments strung together. If you're constantly living in anticipation of what's next, you'll miss out on the beauty of what's happening right now—whether it's a conversation with a loved one, a quiet cup of coffee, or simply appreciating your surroundings.

### Practical Tips to Stay Present:

*   **Use Affirmations:** Repeat phrases like *""The day will come—it always does""* or *""I trust things will happen in their time.""* These affirmations can help calm your mind.
*   **Create a To-Do List:** Write down tasks for today so you have clear goals to focus on.
*   **Practice Mindfulness:** Take deep breaths or meditate for a few minutes to center yourself in the present.
*   **Set Time Limits for Daydreaming:** Allow yourself 5–10 minutes to think about the future event, then shift back to your current priorities.
*   **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge what you accomplish each day—it keeps you motivated and reminds you that progress is happening now.

By practicing these strategies and embracing each day as it comes, you'll not only ease your anxiety but also make meaningful use of your time while waiting for something exciting ahead!

1ik2cag,https://www.reddit.com/r/bugfreeAI/comments/1ik2cag/design_a_yelplike_system_system_design_interview/,Design a Yelp-like System: System Design Interview,"Building a system akin to Yelp requires addressing multiple complex technical challenges, including efficient search, personalized recommendations, scalability, data consistency, and system reliability. This document delves into the underlying mechanisms that make such a system function effectively.

[System Design Diagram — Design Yelp](https://preview.redd.it/xotyerwo8oge1.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fb29fe41d1968be47f4832dcc58f4b629bd7937)

# System Performance and Scalability

**Distributed Architecture**

* **Microservices-Based Approach**: Yelp-like platforms handle a wide range of functionalities, from user authentication to search and reviews. A microservices architecture decouples these services, enabling independent scaling and maintenance. For instance, the review service can be scaled separately from the business listing service, which helps manage load during high traffic events like a restaurant week when reviews spike.
* **Stateless APIs**: By designing APIs to be stateless, the system can distribute requests evenly across multiple instances, which is crucial for handling millions of daily queries without bottlenecks. If a server instance fails, another instance can seamlessly take over without losing user data, enhancing system reliability.
* **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Services like Consul or Eureka can dynamically locate available microservices, ensuring requests are routed to healthy instances. This is essential for a Yelp-like system, where user-generated content must be processed in real time, and delays could degrade user experience. Load balancers ensure that no single service instance is overwhelmed, maintaining consistent response times.

**Database Scaling**

* **Sharding**: Yelp must store and query vast amounts of business data, reviews, and user profiles. Sharding the database based on geographic location (e.g., state or city) minimizes query times for location-specific searches. This approach is crucial to ensure that a user searching for restaurants in San Francisco isn’t impacted by data queries for New York restaurants.
* **Replication**: To provide a fast, reliable user experience, Yelp can use read replicas across different geographical regions. This reduces latency for read-heavy operations, such as viewing business details or reading reviews, by routing requests to the nearest replica instead of the primary database.
* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: By separating the write operations (e.g., posting a review) from read operations (e.g., retrieving business details), Yelp can optimize its data storage according to usage patterns. The write model can be optimized for consistent updates, while the read model is tuned for low-latency queries, crucial for delivering a snappy user experience.

**High Availability & Fault Tolerance**

* **Replication & Redundancy**: For a system as large as Yelp, any downtime can significantly impact users and businesses. Implementing replication across multiple data centers ensures data availability even in case of hardware failures. Leader-follower replication allows a quick failover mechanism, which is essential to keep the service running without interruptions.
* **Circuit Breakers & Rate Limiting**: Yelp needs to ensure that a spike in traffic (e.g., a viral post about a restaurant) does not crash the system. Circuit breakers help detect service failures and prevent cascading failures across dependent services. Rate limiting protects the system from abusive behavior, such as bots scraping data or users overwhelming the API with requests.

**Caching Strategies**

* **Read-heavy Data Caching**: For a platform like Yelp, users frequently access popular business listings and reviews. Caching this data in memory (using Redis or Memcached) significantly reduces database load and improves response times, especially during peak hours.
* **Write-through & Write-back Policies**: When a user posts a review, the data can be updated in the cache (write-through) to ensure consistency across read requests. This approach ensures that users immediately see their submitted reviews without having to wait for database updates.
* **Cache Invalidation**: To avoid serving stale business information (e.g., a closed restaurant still appearing as “open”), Yelp can implement cache eviction policies like LRU and TTL. This ensures that the most current data is always presented to the user, maintaining data accuracy.

# User Discovery and Search

**Search Algorithms**

* **Full-Text Search**: Yelp’s core functionality is finding businesses quickly based on user input. An inverted index allows the system to efficiently retrieve business listings or reviews containing specific keywords. This approach is crucial when dealing with millions of businesses and user-generated reviews.
* **Tokenization & Stemming**: Since users might search for variations of words (e.g., “pizzeria” vs. “pizza place”), tokenization and stemming help standardize search queries, ensuring comprehensive search results. This improves the user experience by capturing all relevant listings.
* **Ranking (BM25, TF-IDF)**: Yelp needs to return the most relevant businesses for a given query. Algorithms like BM25 prioritize results based on keyword relevance and frequency, ensuring that popular, well-reviewed businesses appear higher in the search results.

**Geolocation Search**

* **Spatial Indexing**: Since Yelp heavily relies on proximity searches (e.g., “restaurants near me”), spatial indexing enables efficient location-based queries. This reduces the query time significantly when filtering businesses by location.
* **Haversine Formula**: Yelp users frequently look for businesses within a specific radius. The Haversine formula helps calculate distances accurately, ensuring that the nearest locations are recommended first.
* **Geohashing**: By converting geographic coordinates into geohashes, Yelp can quickly identify and group businesses located near each other. This is particularly useful for displaying clustered results on maps and for efficient geospatial queries.

**Keyword Matching & Ranking**

* **TF-IDF**: TF-IDF helps Yelp determine the importance of words within business descriptions or reviews, improving the relevance of search results. This is especially useful for filtering businesses by specific features (e.g., “vegan-friendly”).
* **Semantic Search**: Implementing semantic search allows Yelp to understand user queries more contextually. For instance, if a user searches for “child-friendly cafes,” the system can return results that are marked as family-friendly, even if the exact term doesn’t appear in business descriptions.

# Personalization

**Collaborative Filtering**

* **User-based Filtering**: Yelp can recommend restaurants that similar users enjoyed. This is particularly effective when new users join, as they can get tailored recommendations based on users with similar tastes.
* **Item-based Filtering**: By analyzing user interactions, Yelp can identify which businesses are frequently reviewed together. This helps in suggesting complementary businesses (e.g., a coffee shop near a frequently visited bookstore).
* **Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS)**: Decomposing the user-business interaction matrix helps Yelp understand deeper patterns in user preferences, which is crucial for generating personalized business recommendations, even for users with limited interaction history.

**Content-Based Filtering**

* **Feature Engineering**: Yelp can analyze business attributes like cuisine type, pricing, and ambiance to create detailed profiles for businesses. This enables the system to suggest similar businesses when a user likes a particular type of place.
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Business descriptions and user reviews are vectorized to find businesses with similar profiles. This is useful for recommending new places based on previously liked businesses, even in different geographical areas.

**Machine Learning Models**

* **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**: DNNs can learn complex user behavior patterns, such as preferred cuisines and locations, to deliver more accurate recommendations. This approach helps Yelp enhance user engagement by providing relevant suggestions.
* **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs)**: Yelp can use GBDTs to rank search results based on various structured features, ensuring the most relevant businesses appear at the top for each user query.

# Data Collection and Integration

**Third-Party Data Integration**

* **API Rate Limits & Caching**: Yelp integrates data from external sources (e.g., Google Maps for geolocation). Caching this data helps avoid excessive API calls, reducing costs and improving response times for users.
* **Data Synchronization Strategies**: Regular data synchronization through ETL pipelines ensures that business details are current, minimizing discrepancies between Yelp and external data sources. This is critical for maintaining an accurate business directory.

**User-Generated Content Handling**

* **Content Moderation**: Since Yelp relies heavily on user-generated reviews, maintaining the quality of this content is crucial. Rule-based filtering and machine learning models help detect spam or inappropriate content, ensuring that reviews remain trustworthy.
* **Storage Optimization**: Yelp stores massive amounts of media files (photos, videos). Distributed file systems like Amazon S3 optimize storage costs and provide scalability, accommodating the ever-growing volume of user-generated content.

# Review and Rating System

**Standardization and Bias Mitigation**

* **Normalization**: Yelp’s rating system benefits from normalization, as it adjusts for user-specific biases (e.g., some users consistently give high or low ratings), ensuring a fair representation of business quality.
* **Bias Detection**: Yelp can identify fraudulent reviews using clustering techniques. This helps maintain the integrity of the review system, protecting businesses from unfair ratings.

**Sentiment Analysis**

* **NLP-based Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis helps Yelp extract the overall mood of user reviews, which can be used to rank businesses or highlight key aspects (e.g., excellent service, poor ambiance).
* **Feature Engineering**: Extracting features from reviews (e.g., specific compliments or complaints) gives Yelp deeper insights into business attributes, allowing for more nuanced search and recommendations.

1ik27z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1ik27z5/what_would_you_do_in_this_situation_if_anything/,What would you do in this situation (if anything)?,"TLDR: Small, hotel style luxury apartment building where the owner / developer of the building lives in the building and brings down the resident experience for everyone — can we do anything?

Our apartment owner is, allegedly, a micromanaging control freak that has been the sole cause of us turning through 4 management companies in 2 years. The word from past management staff is that the owner is miserable to work for and gives them no freedom to make the residents happy.

Examples of “tea” (unconfirmed) we’ve heard from past management staff:

— Owner allegedly forces them to raise rent against their best judgement / despite them warning the owner that it’ll push the building above market rates and cause existing residents to not renew AND potential residents to not sign  

— Owner allegedly denies approvals for improvements that are requested by residents en masse (such as building/amenity updates), even though the management feels there is plenty room in the budget for it and that the improvements would help them retain residents AND sign more leases

— Then, when existing residents leave due to being unhappy, or potential residents aren’t incentivized to sign, owner fires the management, allegedly for the occupancy rate being low..… or the management is just so miserable that they quit before it even gets to that. 

This cycle repeats every 4-6 months. 

On top of that, residents have also noticed the owner’s behavior directly. Examples of “tea” (unconfirmed) that has been shared amongst the residents:

— Owner has allegedly been overheard describing residents of color they saw around the building as “riff raff” and assuming that these individuals were not residents and didn’t belong in the building 

— Shortly after the above ^ owner was allegedly overheard asking management staff for a list of all Black residents that live in the building

— A much-loved (by residents) member of a previous management staff abruptly quit, allegedly because the owner repeatedly made said staff member feel uncomfortable and borderline sexually harassed

— Owner was allegedly overseen/overheard getting into a screaming match with a resident after confronting them about how said resident drives and parks in our resident parking garage

Most fellow residents I’ve spoken to feel that the owner is constantly overstepping the boundary of what an owner should be, and that if the owner were not as involved, all of our overall experiences here would be improved. Not only would we be able to actually build a steady/solid relationship with management instead of being passed around to a new staff every few months, but also all of our long standing requests for building improvements may finally be able to get implemented. 

Our building is EXTREMELY lacking compared to other apartments in the same area and price range, especially with building amenities which are essentially nonexistent…. no package pickup/locker system (our packages get lost or mixed up CONSTANTLY), our “gym” is like 3 working machines, our pool is 3 feet deep and kiddie pool sized (literally), our “coffee bar” is out of stock or broken 75% of the time, and the building security is VERY lacking, which has not been corrected even after having multiple break-ins into the building, one where an older female resident was physically assaulted by the person who broke in. 

Keep in mind this is (supposed to be) a legitimately high-end/luxury apartment building — rent STARTS at $3k.

I’ve always assumed there is no real repercussions we can pursue due to the fact that it’s the building owner… this person owns and developed the building, all the profit goes to them, all the rent rates & leases are ultimately up to them, they have all the control and can retaliate against anyone who goes against them. I don’t see any residents being open to putting their necks (and their living situation) out there for a lawsuit or anything. 

The apartments are beyond beautiful and spacious and in an amazing location with amazing views; the sentiment I can gather from most residents is that while we all are dissatisfied with the greater building and staff situation, the apartment/units themselves are what’s keeping us here (for now), and we just wish we could do something to improve the admin/management side.

Is this just one of those “grin and bear it” type of things? 

Has anyone experienced something similar?

1ik23n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1ik23n8/damage_done_im_done/,Damage done! I'm done,"Iv always ignored bullies my whole life and stuck up for victims. For the past couple of years I have found myself being the work place agony aunt. There's been a couple of staff members (jack and Jill) taking the absolute p*ss on shift. They talk and don't do much. After a while jack and Jill started affecting me personally. I wasn't getting out of work on time and my break was moved around all of the time to accommodate them. I was also given a bigger work load and jobs they didn't like to do. Jill befriended all of the managers with flattery, gifts and coffees. 

One day Jill started randomly spreading around rumours about me. It was everyday and to anybody who would listen. People who had moaned to me about her was now her friends. After being everybody's agony aunt for so long it's like overnight all of their complaining and moaning was turned around on me. People was accusing me of saying stuff that I had actually listened to. From that day I wouldn't discuss Jill anymore. I felt like things had gone too far.

Months later the rumours about me had continued. The rumours became more extreme. I started dreading going into work. I spoke to my managers in confidence about how I was feeling and that I was struggling to cope mentally. I just couldn't escape it. Two out of four of my managers advised me to complain assuring me they had noticed that it was her and not me. After two months of having staff members approach me every single day to tell me what Jill had said I decided to follow my managers advice and complain. I was crying at work, home and wasn't sleeping. I didn't eat for a solid 24hours a couple of times. 

After the complaint our company decided to investigate. After many meetings, tears and more sleepless nights I received their out come. In this time I had been given absolutely no support at work, ignored and generally felt like an outcast. I believe I did everything correctly due to following the managers advice.

The company have decided it was my fault, all of it. All four of my managers had a private interview and said I was the agresser. One manager was new, one told me to complain, one had gossiped them self and laughed at me during the investigation, the last one had gossiped, believed Jill's stories, told me to complain and then completely dropped me while the investigation took place. 

I feel like a fool!! I trusted my managers and they did this to me. My company said they don't want me there anymore and that they have 'proof' of my gossiping. The proof was message I sent to a mutual friend between me and Jill to ask why everyone kept telling me her and Jill was talking about me and why Jill said she was going to vouch against me. I made it very clear in the message that I didn't want to talk about jack and Jill. I was more concerned about someone pretending to be my friend. It was this message that nearly got me fired!!

After meetings with the company, me and Jill we have agreed to move on from it. Me and Jill have even spoken a bit at work. Although I'm allowed to stay with the company for now and I'm trying my best I just can't stop being depressed. Iv had colleagues since claim to be my friend and planned a dinner date with me. They stood me and my baby up! I can barely look at my managers without filling up with anger inside. Due to my current situation I have to stay with the company another 15months. 

I spend my days watching all of my colleagues flock around Jill, even those who used to complain about her to me. I'm currently living my worst nightmare. I spend my days in a room full of people who hate me. All the smiles they give me are fake! Everyone whose been my friends for many years even hang out with Jill now and couldn't give less of a shit about me. There's only one colleague whose truly been there for me. I think if it wasn't for her I would of killed myself by now. 

I don't think I'll ever trust anybody ever again! How can so many people turn against me overnight? What have I done that's so bad? I'll forever be an outcast there now!",2,1738953270.0,workplace_bullying,3,1.0,False

1ik21vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ik21vf/would_you_read_a_story_like_this/,Would you read a story like this?,"All his life, He never noticed anything amiss about anything at all.

He, John Smith, looked back on his first memory he ever had, going to school on his first day of kindergarten, wearing a blue shirt with white polka dots, and orange shorts, his favorite color. He thought about the other kids, sitting at tables in groups, one with a denim jersey with light speckles, another with tangerine knee - high pants, another with a celadon top with a pattern of bleached circles. All very good, well - behaved children. Their teacher, Mr. S, with his auburn hair and good looks, taught the class in a variety of subjects. But, he had a passion for scientific topics. Like covering the lifecycle of a tadpole, explaining that the earth was a part of the solar system, and that the body was made of cells. 

He was also interested in the sciences, perhaps partly from Mr. S’s enthusiasm, but It also may have been encouraged by his parents, the Smiths. He remembered a time when his parents gave him a microscope for Christmas one year. *My Family*, he thought. He gave thanks to the handsome reddish - brown hair and shapely figure he inherited from them. His family was humble - his parents were both “waste removal technicians” - but they were able to scrape together enough to give good presents that year.

His first job involved sweeping floors and taking out the trash. One of his acquaintances, John, was a janitor, and could share his pain - His dream was to be a researcher. They managed to jump around different jobs assuming different roles, but somehow it all led back to working with garbage.

But he was off today, and today he had headed down to the local bagel shop, to get a breakfast sandwich, a popular item on the menu, when he heard a strange voice. He turned around, and had the shock of his life.

The man before him, sitting at the cafe table with an everything bagel and a black coffee, was… well, he could not put his finger on it. He took a deep breath and thought, *let's break this problem down*.

The man had a slightly dark complexion, as if a handsome tan. He wore round sunglasses, an orange reflection crossing them. His hair was dark, and part of it swept down over his face like drapes. He had a short mustache, and a soul patch. His dark indigo suit was way too formal for a bagel shop. *Was he going somewhere important*, he thought, *like a wedding, or a business meeting?* 

Well, he was going to have to ask.

Walking up to the man intimidated him, somehow. When the man heard the footsteps coming near him, he looked up, with piercing, dark brown eyes that were almost black, which struck him with fear. He stood still, but just for a moment. *Why do I feel this way*, he thought.

 He continued walking up to the man sitting down, looked into his eyes, and asked, “What’s your name?”

“Fareed, Fareed Oruvan.”

It began to slowly dawn on him. “It” being the fact that he had never heard a name like that before. He had heard of names like John, and…

He tried to think. *What other names…?*

He looked around, trying to come up with the answer. He saw a customer, with a plaid red and green shirt, auburn hair, and blue denim jeans. His eyes darted around the room. He looked at a few other customers. They were also wearing plaid shirts and jeans. *Some kind of club?* He thought. He turned around, only to see more people with matching hair, shirts and jeans. His eyes passed over to the nearby window, showing a reflection of a man also wearing a plaid shirt with blue jeans and auburn hair.

*Wait, that’s me!* He thought. *That’s my reflection.*

Then, something else dawned on him, something immensely dreadful. He looked down upon himself, seeing that he was indeed correct, that the reflection was his, and that he was indeed wearing a green and red plaid shirt, with blue denim jeans. He glanced quickly around the room. And a realization came upon him.

*Everyone looks like me*, he thought. Suddenly, he began to breathe heavily. *Or, do I look like everyone?*

The man in front of him, though, did not look like everyone. He looked different.

Teacher and student father (M4a or m4f) only discord and Instagram 


I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

# Day 1: Snorkeling and Surfing

* Snorkeling at [Honaunau Bay](https://bigislandguide.com/honaunau-bay-two-step) (aka Two Step Beach): *beautiful coral and lots of fish, definitely worth a visit. FYI, not a sandy beach to chill on, just rocks.* 
* Surfing lesson with [Kahaluu Bay Surf & Sea](https://learntosurfkona.com/) ($120 pp): *Had a blast and had great instruction. The shop is located just a couple minutes from the beach entrance. We managed to catch a few waves. If you’re a beginner, look to book on a day with \~2ft waves, no bigger than 3 ft.* 

# Day 2: Weather Adjustments and Manta Rays

* Kealakekua bay kayaking: *Waves were too high to kayak, so we ended up hanging out on Manini beach. It's a really nice grassy beach, again no sand.* 
* Manta Ray snorkel tour at night with [Kona Snorkel Trips](https://konasnorkeltrips.com/): *One of the highlights of our trip. Highly recommend this group. Very entertaining and fun guides.*

# Day 3: North Side Beaches + Luau

* Hapuna beach: *This was our first large, sandy beach. The waves here are particularly nice for boogie boarding. Had a great time lounging on this beach.*
* Royal Kona Luau: *We sat and watched the luau from a distance for free. Felt kind of white lotus-y*
* Laverne’s at night: *Lots of hip hop and r&b played by the DJ. Decently crowded and was going pretty strong until 2 am.* 
   * Park on the highway for free parking. Parallel park next to Laverne's. 

# Day 4: Kealakekua Bay Kayak and Snorkel

* Kealakekua bay kayaking: W*aves were good this day, so we kayaked out to the monument. Snorkeling there was amazing. So much life, with entire schools of fish swimming around together. To see dolphins, try to go out much earlier around 7 am / 8 am. The dolphins hang out close to the cliff near the monument.* 

# Accommodations

* Ka’awaloa trail farm in Captain Cook (we were able to stay in an extra room at a coffee farm for free, but they also sometimes put their coffee shack up on airbnb)

# Stand-out food/drink

* Poke bowls at grocery stores (KTA supermarket and Choicemart). *Lots of fresh fish, great value.* 
* Ocean View Bar: *Happy hour here with really cheap margs, and Taco Thursday was also a vibe.* 
* Sacred grounds coffee: *This place has an incredible perch over the cliff with a view of the coastline. My latte was remarkably good.* 
* Pine Tree Cafe: *This unassuming spot near the airport was surprisingly packed, and for good reason. All of their plate lunches look delicious, I really enjoyed my loco moco.*
* Touristy, a bit more expensive than I’d prefer, but still good: 
   * Da shark shack has excellent views: *Grabbed a couple beers and wings while enjoying the sunset.* 
   * Don’s Mai Tai Bar at the Royal Kona: *Absolutely stellar views of the ocean. Also managed to order off the happy hour menu - $10 margs and $15 nachos*
* Mcdonalds mc teriyaki was exactly what a fast food burger with fast food quality teriyaki sauce sounds like it would be. 

# Hilo: Days 5-8

# Sunday: Drive from Captain Cook (South Kona) to Pahoa 

* Stopped at the “southernmost point of the US” on the way. 7/10. 
* Stopped at Punalu'u bakery. Very overhyped in my opinion. 4/10.

# Monday: Volcano National Park Day

* Enjoyed the view from Volcano House (it’s a restaurant, but anyone can come and share the view on their balcony)
* Did the 6 mi loop starting at the beginning of the Devastation Trail -> Kilauea Iki -> Lava Tube
   * *If you take this route, you get an excellent secluded view of the big crater while you are walking on “Byron’s ledge” (the part connecting Devastation Trail and Kilauea Iki.* 
* Volcano started erupting around 6 pm, so we drove back to VNP and spent the evening/night at the national park. We went to the same secluded lookout we found while hiking, and we had a completely private view of the volcano erupting!

# Tuesday: Black Sand Beaches

* Kalapana to Pohoiki Beach drive. Stopped by the fissure 8 site (2018 volcano eruption that tore through one of the neighborhoods in Pahoa), and Kehena black sand beach (clothing optional beach). The drive was beautiful. 
* Richardson Black Sand Beach. Snorkeling here was cool - there were fish that I hadn’t seen at all on the other side of the island. Lots of turtles here as well (not at the same place where you go snorkeling)

# Wednesday: Mauna Kea and Wrapping Up

* Mauna Kea sunrise: Can only go to the peak if you have a 4x4, but it’s still worth going to the visitor center and experiencing it from there. Tip: it gets cold and windy up there!! Wear layers. 
* Honolii beach and watching surfers
* Akaka Falls State Park:  ($5/person or $10/car) Home to Akaka Falls, a stunning 442-foot waterfall.
* Drive to Kona airport

# Accommodations

* We stayed in a 2 br airbnb in pahoa. It was great: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/41805396?source\_impression\_id=p3\_1738915276\_P3Dbu2oOGcJLzwsr](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/41805396?source_impression_id=p3_1738915276_P3Dbu2oOGcJLzwsr)
* Punatics: [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Punatic](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Punatic)

# Stand-out food/drink

* Luquins Mexican Restaurant in Pahoa hit the spot 8/10. Not amazing like you need to go get it if it’s out of your way. 
* Tetsumen Ramen in Hilo was delicious and inexpensive. 
* Ning’s thai cuisine in Pahoa was good but felt a little pricey for the portion size. 
* Volcano House in the VNP was pricey and mediocre. I got the burger which tasted like a cafeteria burger, and my friend’s fish and chips had 2 little slivers of fish. However, from looking at other people’s tables, their pizza’s did look really good.
* Wanted to try but heard good things: Pahoa Fresh Fish (really good fish and chips), Miyos Japanese restaurant. 

# Things we missed:

* Green Sand Beach: Free but requires a long hike or 4x4. Also we didn't care too much to see slightly green sand. 
* Waipio Valley: Again, no 4x4 to properly explore it. Also, the standout hike (Muilua trail) was closed off to hikers unless purchased as part of a guided hike.  
* Pololu Valley ",0,1738952754.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.5,False

I am hoping to get some opinions and ideas before I fully get this thing in motion! I plan to ask this in a group that is actually in my community eventually but I am a little nervous someone will steal my idea before I can get it going LMAO. This business would be focused on crafts, art, innovation, and being creative! So if you consider yourself a crafter or artist, I hope this is something that you will love! Read my ideas below and then simply answer my questions for a chance to win the contest! Winner will be chosen at random! Must be US or have gift card option!

There would be a large space for open crafting during certain hours of the day. This space would offer tables, basic sewing machines, crochet hooks, knitting needles, cricuts and accessories, heat press, paint, printers, scissors, and other basic tools and equipment for most crafts/arts for your use. I am also hoping to offer a limited amount of materials to work with for free if I am able to get some donations (I plan to ask for donations of unwanted crafting materials). There would be a fee to use the space. I figured this would be awesome for those who don't have the space for a full craft room, you bring your project and use our space and equipment. Or great for those who want to try something, say sewing for example, but don’t want to spend the money on the sewing machine, fabric, needles, thread, etc just to find out they maybe didn’t enjoy it as much as they hoped. They can come try these things here! This space will be open to all ages (kids would need adult supervision). MOST OF MY QUESTIONS FOR INPUT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SPECIFIC PART OF THE BUSINESS - These questions are below and are the questions that you need to answer in order to be entered into the contest. I will list the rest of my ideas for the space after the questions in case you don’t want to read that much!

***Is this something you would use frequently? How often? How much would you be willing to spend per hour for a space like this? What hours of the day would be best for you to personally be able to attend the open craft space? What kinds of crafts/equipment/tools would you love to see available? What types of workshops would you be most interested in attending? What ideas do you have?***

We would also have a small gift shop that we would rent vendor booth space to local artists and crafters. Evenings would be dedicated to workshops and classes! I personally would host some classes/workshops and have some others that would like to as well, but also want to open it up as a space for others to host their classes and workshops, as well (think paint and sips, or canning classes, or anything really)! 

I’d also love to have other random fun crafts and classes during the day (which would also be when open craft would be available). The space would be open to all ages and would include kid-focused crafts and senior-focused crafts! There would be a space where there will be a very limited amount of “premium” supplies available (a few fabrics, yarns, beads, etc) for purchase.

I have soooo many other ideas such as renting the space for parties or team-building activities, offering coffee eventually, homeschool hour, or possibly even having an after-school program at some point!

I (27M) Grew up in a small town in Montana, really was sweet FA to do except get drunk, get high, do dumb hoodrat shit and game. This was my 24/7. I never had a girlfriend throughout high school, all my friends had several and lost their virginities early (like 15/16). I felt so behind I kinda hated myself for it.

Along comes Sophie. Hot as fuck, funny as fuck, super confident, super smart. My type through and through, one snag, she had no interest in me and was all over my friend Pete, they eventually began dating.

It sucked seeing those two date, I was happy for my boy but it really fucking hurt. I was jealous, bitter. I resented them, I wrote in my journal about how she “must be r-worded to choose him over me who she has so much in common with”. I began to distance myself from those two so that my jealous feelings didn’t interfere. 

Cut to a few months later, at a party. Me, all my friends are there. Pete shows up with Sophie, I’m drunk and I feel myself getting mad. I told my friend Jack and he took me outside and introduced me to this other girl, Amy. I didn’t care for her one bit, I’m sure in hindsight she was nice but I was such a dick to this girl cuz of how bitter I was about him and Sophie. I ended up dating Amy somehow, it was an awful relationship. I got head from her a few times but didn’t have sex straight away.

A few months after that, there’s another party, at this point people were well aware of how toxic I was being with Amy. I had fully let this crush I had fill me with bitterness and jealousy and rage, I hated myself, I was self harming regularly. It’s like it just exaggerated everything I hated about my self, idk if it was the full reason why but it definitely triggered something.

 Sophie noticed I turned up drunk and alone to this party, she asked me why. I told her the truth, “being around Amy is boring. I think I hate her”. Sophie was a good friend and clearly saw I was way too drunk to be around people and offered to drive me home.

We pull up outside my house, Sophie walks me to the door. I told her how I felt. How I thought she was perfect and how I couldn’t get her out of my head. I kissed Sophie, to my surprise she didn’t pull away. She told me she couldn’t do anything with me because of Pete. I kissed her again, this time she held it. I told her to come upstairs with me. She did and we had sex. After I finished the first round, I asked her why she did it, why she cheated. She asked me “why did you?”. We went again for another few rounds.

I woke up feeling lower than I ever had in my life. If there is something lower than disgust and pure self hatred I felt it. I ruined my relationship and my friend’s relationship for a stupid quick fuck. I wish I could say that it was just the one time, it wasn’t. Fucking Sophie was the only time I didn’t completely hate myself. I think just knowing that someone like her found me attractive enough to go to bed with gave me some hope.

Our sexual relationship continued as did our romantic relationships. My self harming reduced when I knew I was gonna get to see Sophie but after she left it always picked back up worse. Should also add that at this time Amy and I had also started to have sex, sex with Amy felt weak, felt wrong. Like comparing a michelin star meal with a microwave cheese burger.

I guess after months of neglect and a really piss poor relationship. Amy finally had enough. I wish she had just broken up with me though. She used my thumb when I was passed out drunk to open my phone and found all the texts Sophie and I had sent to each other. All the pics and videos we took together. She slapped me awake and asked me to explain myself. Idk what made me say it to her but I very bluntly said “I don’t want you as much as I want her. You bore me”. She threw my phone at me, burst out crying and left. She told Pete after who also blew up at me, threatened to kill me, etc. My friend group basically dropped me.

After a break from the whole situation and into my freshman year at college, Sophie reached out to meet. I explained to her I was trying to get sober and came clean about my self harming. Sophie told me that after she left me, Amy hooked up with Pete. He ended up getting her pregnant, they aborted it and Amy attempted suicide soon after, thankfully she survived. I didn’t know what to say. I was responsible for that, for all of it. My bitter jealousy destroyed 2 good people for no reason. Sophie and I kept in touch for a minute but it fizzled out. I swore to just try to be good for the rest of my life.

Cut to now, I honestly hadn’t thought about the situation in a long time. I haven’t drank or got high in about 5 years. I got one of those “you may know this person” notifications on instagram about Sophie. I checked her page all the memories came flooding back. I followed, DM’d and we’ve been talking for a bit and have plans for a coffee date on the weekend. I’m not sure what I’m aiming to get out of this, a relationship maybe. Do it properly this time though. Amy and Pete have me blocked on everything and most others have Sophie and I blocked too. I wish there was something I could do, just tell my younger self to not date Amy and make a move on Sophie earlier or something. All hypotheticals, all equally useless to ponder over. All I can hope is my date this weekend goes well.

1ik1p17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ik1p17/senior_cat_experiencing_loss_of_balance/,Senior cat experiencing loss of balance.,"Hi there, my ten year old cat who has been youthful and a picture of great health until 2 weeks ago has very suddenly started behaving strangely. It started with just noticed him slipping off a windowsill which is one of his favourite sleeping spots, but he’s always been a bit clumsy so it wasn’t a huge change. But we noticed he was struggling to walk along the back of the couch too later in the week, his paws were slipping down the sofa cushions. His claws are still engaging though when he wants to grab something.
Today we noticed that he’s ver hesitant to jump up onto the sofa or bed, and it just putting his front paws on it and then looking confused like he’s not sure how to get up. He’s also hesitant about jumping down off the coffee table if he does manage to get up there.
His eating, drinking and toilet habits do not seem to have changed, but he’s suddenly less active.
He’s a very sociable and cuddly cat, but he’s become suddenly very clingy in a way that is unusual for him, and seems to like being picked up and carried which he’s normally not a fan of.
He gets VERY stressed by having to take car journeys, so I delayed calling the vet until today. This has been going on over the course of about 2 weeks. I called the vet today and booked him an appointment for Monday. But until then, any ideas on what it could be or whether he might be in pain? (He doesn’t seem to be.) Google is suggesting arthritis, but it seems too rapid a change to be that.",1,1738952301.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

I had a dream Maddie, Tom, sonic, tails, knuckles, shadow and me- geez that's a big group...

I had a dream we all went to this fancy shmancy place, like a hotel of some sorts.

And Maddie and Tom told us all to go look at the desserts. 

ALSO SIDE NOTE SHADOW WAS HOLDING MY HAND THE WHOLE TIME😭

so we walk over and sonic is immediately lured to this one cake/dessert thing, idk what it was. I was personally eyeing the cheesecake but then tails points down at one of the desserts, saying ""look! It's called shadow!""

We all look down and shadow just goes ""...huh."" 

I lean down and read the ingredients- which I don't know how because all I saw was the word ""shadow"" idk where I saw ingredients. 

Anyways I read it, I laughed and said- ""that practically is yours, absolutely nothing anyone else would like. Its pretty much your coffee in a different form.""

Shadow looked a little interested but didn't say anything. 

We all made our way back to Maddie and Tom and Maddie pointed over to a kids Harry Potter themed birthday party.

I don't remember our interaction here, only that knuckles said something nonchalant-like.

And then later in the dream, there was something bad happening in the hotel and me and sonic found ourselves trapped on one of the floors since the elevator wasn't working due to the thing.

I remember something was coming for us so we hid in this cabinet thing, which idk why sonic was hiding either💀

But I remember whatever was looking for us searched around, shook the room a bit, then left- or so we thought.

So we left and began making our way to the stairwell, WHICH BAD IDEA DREAM ME, HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK THE MYSTERY CREATURE GOT IN HERE.

anyways the monster scares us and sonic tries fighting it- guess what, I never see it 🙄

Later in the dream I remember I'm outside now while the others fight this thing they I can't see, and I find this magic portal door... That looks like an actual door. And it's open, so to help the team in support I close it.

Next thing I know they're done fighting... I still see no creature 😤

And then the hotel rewards us since those four saved everyone",1,1738952253.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Never met my biological dad. Lived in apartments, they couldn’t afford a house. Always got the cheapest generic brand everything to save money, etc. We were on food stamps. I got free lunch at school. Most of my clothes were hand downs from older cousins. 

Now I’m grown up and I think middle class. I was able to buy a small house for myself and I have expendable income. Anyway somehow my social circle is made up of people whose parents were medical doctors, university professors, that kind of thing. 

Anytime they reminisce about their childhoods it’s such a contrast to how I grew up. I still have some “poor” habits. They don’t like I buy the cheapest coffee and have a regular ass coffee pot. They thjnk it’s weird I’ve never left the country. They think it’s funny I like pro wrestling. Most of them went to private school. 

We get along great they’re not jerks about it, just funny I ended up hanging out with all these “rich kids”. ",8,1738951928.0,self,1,0.79,False
