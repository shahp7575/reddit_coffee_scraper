This time I tried something different. I moved most of my funds off exchanges into self-custody before traveling and only left a small trading stack accessible on my phone. That’s sitting in a non-custodial app (Best Wallet for now since it connects to DEXes across a bunch of chains) so I can scratch the itch with a few small trades without nuking my main stack. It sounds dumb but physically limiting what I can access from the couch helped a ton. The photo idea is my laptop closed on the coffee table, phone in front showing a tiny balance and a bunch of unread family group texts.",1,1766132082.0,CryptoReality,0,1.0,False

No signal no plans just tired driving legs and a need to cook something warm. The sunset turned the sky orange and purple a couple in an old Land Cruiser waved as they passed and the night was so quiet it felt unreal. One night turned into three. Mornings were coffee on the step evenings were sharing stories with strangers who somehow felt familiar and every day reminded me why a mobile simple life feels so freeing. No schedule no rush just moving when it feels right. Moments like this make the hard days worth it the breakdowns the weather the long stretches of nothing.

Bella

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.

Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.

“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”

She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”

“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”

“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”

I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”

But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.

I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.

After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.

The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrilled that I said yes right away. We fixed a wedding date with our families. We booked the hall, picked flowers, and chose the cake. I kept a list for everything, doing things personally even though my father had a fleet of personnel to work for me.

As soon as Lucy left our wedding boutique, I snuck out. I put the gown in my car and drove to Craig’s apartment. I had a key he gave me months ago. He had said, “Use it when you want to surprise me.” I smiled at the memory. The building had a private elevator. I rode up and stepped into his foyer.

The living room was quiet. I set the garment bag on the sofa and called out softly, “Craig?” There was no answer. His shoes were by the door, and his jacket was on a chair. He had to be home.

I walked down the hall toward the bedroom. As I got closer, I saw a trail of clothes on the floor. A red lace top, a silk skirt, bra and panties, and a pair of heels tipped on their sides. I stopped and blinked. It looked like someone undressed in a hurry. I smiled to myself. “Must be Evan,” I whispered. Craig’s younger cousin liked to drop by without warning with a date. I rolled my eyes and decided to leave. I picked up the garment bag and turned to go when I heard a soft sound. It was a low breathy moan from Craig’s bedroom. Feeling embarrassed, I increased my pace. But froze the next moment when a man’s voice came through the door, rough and loud. “Mayaaaa!”

Shock rippled through me and I stopped moving. Was that Craig’s voice? No, God, no. My first thought was that I misheard. My stepsister, Maya, hadn’t come back to the city in four years. She never showed her face to us even once ever since she left after that fight. I turned over my shoulder to look at the half-closed bedroom door. Despite myself, I turned back. I reached and saw that the door was slightly open. The room was dim, but I could see enough.

Craig was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair fell across the pillow. He was holding her, naked, and moving inside her. He said her name again, “Oh, Maya!”

Everything in me went quiet as my mind numbed in shock. I stood there for a few seconds, my hands turning clammy, my heart thundering. Craig and Maya together? When did this happen? I had read about this happening in books. You know, just fiction. But this cliché happened in real life as well?

The world tilted so fast I felt dizzy. I slapped my hand on my mouth to stop the sound of my gasp. My mind clicked through little details when I turned around. I noticed a glass of water on the nightstand was half full. There was a smudge of lipstick on the rim. There was a small backpack in the corner with a labubu doll, which was Maya’s. I stepped back, the hallway suddenly too long, the air too thin. I couldn’t breathe.

Unable to process the shock, I turned and went back to the living room. I picked up the garment bag with both hands, opened the door, and walked out.

Inside the elevator, I looked at the reflection of my 23 year old self. Through my pale face, my green eyes stared at me, my blond hair sticking to my face, which was covered with sweat. It was then that I broke down. A sob tore from me making my body shudder. The betrayal was too much to bear. But anger also surged through me, and suddenly I wanted to confront them. How could they do this to me?

So without thinking twice, I went back to his apartment to confront them.

# A Video

Bella

I stood in the hallway and tried to breathe, wondering what I was doing? Should I go in? My confidence wavered.

But I wanted to open the door and shout at them, make them face me. I wanted to ask why, since when, and how could they betray me. I wanted to look at Maya and say, “You stole my fiancé.”

My steps faltered because I also knew how Maya was. She would deny everything in front of our father. She would say I was jealous and that I was lying. Just like last time. She would cry like she had done before. Just before leaving home, she played a victim card, making me look like the villain of her life.

But I wanted to ask Craig if any of the last five years meant anything. Gathering courage and wiping my tears, I walked into the apartment.

Just as I reached outside the bedroom, I heard Maya’s soft and smug voice. She said, “You’ve kept it a secret for four years. I’m so proud of you, Craig. You’re awesome! I only wanted to finish college and then marry you. I couldn’t bear to see my stepsister have your kids.”

Craig laughed. “Bella’s a moron,” he said. “She’s so blind in love with me she never notices anything. It was easy to manipulate her.”

Manipulate me? I stood still and held my breath, my tears silently slipping from my eyes once again.

Maya chuckled and spoke again in a sultry voice, “I’m waiting for your divorce. Then we can start our own business. I’ve been dreaming about it for so long!”

Craig sounded pleased. “Of course, love. I’ll divorce Bella in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to her husband. That’s what her grandfather wrote in his will. So, it will all come to us, baby. I only have to tolerate her for a month more.”

I pressed my palm to the wall because I felt like I might fall. My heart pounded in my ears. I knew about my inheritance. Everyone in the family knew that I would get it after marriage and lose it if I divorced within six months.

Maya chuckled. “You're smart, Craig Jones. Gosh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around the house like she owns everything. The bitch doesn’t know how fast her world is going to crumble. Then I will exact my revenge. After she loses her inheritance, her father will remove her from his will also,” she snickered.

Craig laughed hard. “You’re wicked, Maya. Just be patient for a few more weeks, baby. Then we will have it all!”

They had planned my downfall carefully for so long. If I confronted them, it would be the most foolish thing to do.

“Come, ride me, baby!” Craig said. “Let’s celebrate!”

Anger inside me erupted like a volcano. Celebrate my downfall? I wanted to teach them a lesson now. So I took out my phone, and started recording them. If I sent this video to my father, I was sure he would call off the marriage.

“Oh baby, you’re so good!” Craig said as Maya moved on him.

My hand shook so hard in anger that a few seconds later, my phone slipped down. Craig snapped his head toward me. “Bella!” he gasped, his eyes going wide.

Maya also turned sharply to see me, and her mouth dropped open. “Shit!”

I picked up the phone and rushed out.

Craig removed Maya from him and came after me. “Bella, Bella!”

“I don’t want to hear a thing from you!” I shouted, as I scrambled to send the video to Daddy.

“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t!”

I opened the door. “You both deserve to be exposed!”

“Stop this bullshit, Bella!” he roared. “No one will marry you except me! Your marriage with me is written in stone!”

“I’d rather die than marry you, cheater!” I shouted back through my tears. I pressed the button to send the video to my father.

Craig came after me. But I was out of the door by then. He stood naked on the door of his apartment, watching me leave. “Bellaaaa!” he roared. A few people came out of their apartments hearing the commotion. Good. They would see him naked, dripping in her juices.

I left the apartment building as fast as I could, and went to my car. On the road, the city lights blurred a little. I blinked, trying to clear my vision. My mind played back the words I had just heard. ‘It was a secret for five years’. ‘Divorce in a month’. ‘Twenty million inheritance gone’. ‘Tolerate her for a month more’. ‘I rubbed my chest as the betrayal hurt deep’.

I gripped the steering wheel. I thought about Lucy and her firmly denying me to meet Craig. Did she know? Was she helping them keep me away so I would not see anything? So that their plan was executed smoothly?

Then I thought about my father. If I called him now and told him what I saw, what I heard, would he believe me? No, he wouldn’t. That’s why I sent the video proof. He loved me, but he thought I was an “entitled brat.”

If I hadn’t recorded them in the act, Maya would lie through her teeth in front of him just to get the money. I didn’t trust Craig either. He would rather watch me suffer and make the marriage more miserable.

I remembered how four years ago, after high school, Maya left the house after a fight. She told everyone I was the reason. The house was full of tension for weeks. My father chose to calm Lucy and Maya instead of me. But despite his efforts, Maya left never to return. Since then, Daddy treated me like I might start another problem at any moment. He watched me like I was a risk to manage. He scolded me often because of Maya.

I remembered that fight like it happened yesterday. Maya had cried so much that day, her sobs filled every corner of the house. She stood in front of my father and her mother, acting like she was the victim. She said she would always be a stepsister and that I could never accept her. Then, with a trembling voice, she offered to leave the house so I could live “comfortably.” Lucy’s eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t protest. She only lowered her head and suffered quietly, as if Maya’s sacrifice was breaking her heart.

But the truth was different. The fight started because on the last day of our school, I had caught Maya with Luke. I had confessed to her a week before that I liked Luke.

I had seen her sitting close to him, cuddling him, kissing him on his lips. When I confronted her later, she smiled in a way she wasn’t ashamed. On the contrary, she flaunted her “victory”. “He never liked you!” she had said, flicking her hair.

The betrayal from Luke was nothing compared to the one from Maya. “You can have him,” I replied.

I stifled my feelings for Luke right after so that Maya could be with him. But I don’t know why Maya came home and created the drama, accusing me of just the opposite? She told our parents that it was me who kissed her boyfriend, Luke, and I hated her for being happy. My father believed her and scolded me to be more adjusting. But Maya left for college nonetheless, trapping me into guilt all this while.

It was during that painful time that Craig, Luke’s friend, stepped in. He comforted me, chased after me, and slowly, I fell in love with him. But now Maya had her claws in Craig as well. It was like she wanted to snatch everything I cherished.

# You'll Be Safe

Bella

I didn’t know where to go after leaving Craig’s apartment. My chest still hurt deep from the betrayal, and my thoughts kept circling the same question—how could Maya do this to me again?

Before I knew it, I was parking in front of the Phoenix Mall, the largest and grandest mall in the city. It had chains across the world, and I had heard that its CEO, Scott Moore, was a secretive sharp billionaire bachelor. He was arrogant, and cold, more handsome than God, and had hundreds of girls swooning over him.

I wandered through the bright halls of the mall and walked into a quiet café. The smell of coffee and baked bread wafted in the air. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at a small table by the window. The moment the cup was in my hands, tears started to fall again. I tried to wipe them quickly, but they kept coming. I cried quietly, hoping no one noticed. I couldn’t believe my life had come to this. How was I supposed to stop a marriage my whole family had already planned? Would my father believe the video content? I wondered if I should make the video viral.

Just as I lowered my head to sip my coffee, the door opened, and two men walked in. My heart skipped. It was Luke and Mark, Craig’s friends. Luke was the same boy who I liked in high school before Maya destroyed it all. I quickly bent my head lower, hoping they wouldn’t notice me. They sat two tables behind me, talking and laughing. I couldn’t help but overhear them.

“Bella has always been a moron,” Luke chuckled, stirring his coffee. “She never noticed Craig and Maya were in love. Stupid blind brat. Maya is back in town and she'll be staying with me for a while.”

Mark laughed loudly. “But it works for us, Luke. Craig smartly handled Bella after you goofed up with her. Once he gets Bella’s inheritance, we’re set. Our contracts with him are already drafted. The moment the money comes, we’ll sign. Our businesses will finally take off. Only a month before final goodbye to the bitch!” They both laughed again.

My blood went cold. I clutched my cup so tightly I thought it might break. Their words sank in slowly but clearly. They were all in on it. Craig, Maya, Luke, and Mark. They weren’t just betraying me with love. They were plotting around my inheritance. My stomach twisted, bitterness coating my soul. This all was happening behind my back ever since high school, and like a fool, I never came to know. How gullible I was?

Anger burned in my chest. I wanted to go to their table and confront them, scream that I had come to know it all. On an impulse, I pushed my chair back and stood up quickly. But the moment I turned, I collided with someone. Arms gripped me instantly to stop me from falling.

I craned my neck up, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. A beautiful man, towering over me with broad shoulders, filled the space. He was wearing a pinstripe suit. His face was striking with a sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and dark eyes so intense they seemed to glow. His lips were firm and bow-shaped, his nose straight, his black hair falling just slightly across his forehead. He looked unreal, like a man who didn’t belong to this world. Like a king who ruled the world.

I noticed that there was complete silence in the café now. In that instant, an idea lit up in my mind. A reckless, desperate plan that could actually break the marriage.

I tilted my head slightly, giving Luke and Mark a sidelong glance, then turned back to the man. Without giving myself time to think, I pressed my lips against his.

He growled low in his throat as his hand shot out and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me close. It was protective, possessive, and startling all at once. My body went stiff in his arms, but from the corner of my eyes, I saw Luke and Mark watching us. Their mouths had fallen open. Everyone in the café had turned to stare.

The kiss was quick at first, just enough for everyone to see. I whispered against his lips, “Please, could you keep up the act for a minute?”

To my surprise, he didn’t push me away. Instead, his hand tightened on my waist, and he kissed me back. His lips were warm and commanding. He deepened the kiss, and the world around me blurred. His kiss was passionate, strong, almost overwhelming. For a moment, I forgot why I even started it. I felt my knees weaken, and I had to hold on to his shirt to stay steady.

When we finally broke apart, the café was completely silent. My lips tingled, my cheeks burned, and I couldn’t get a hold of myself. Like my whole body was on fire. 

But I knew Luke and Mark had seen everything. Now they would inform Craig or my father about it. So if the video didn’t work, this would.

“Could you please walk out with me from the café?” I asked softly. “I want them to see it clearly,” I said, darting my eyes to Luke and Mark.

“Do you want me to make them disappear from the face of the earth?” he asked seriously, his intense eyes locked on mine.

My mouth dropped. Was he a mafia boss? I let out a nervous chuckle. “N-no!”

Without waiting, he grabbed my wrist and walked with me toward the door. I glanced back. Luke and Mark had jumped up, chasing us. Panic rushed through me. I pulled closer to the man and whispered urgently, “Please, help me. Hide me for a few hours. I want to escape them.” Now I was afraid that they would confront me and manhandle me.

His dark eyes cut to me. “You shouldn’t trust strangers,” he said in a low and rough voice.

I faltered, my lips parting. I didn’t know what to say. I felt foolish and desperate. But then his eyes softened. “But I’ll save you,” he said.

Something in me believed him instantly. I couldn’t explain why. It was pure instinct.

He led me quickly to a side hallway I hadn’t even noticed before. At the end was a private elevator, hidden behind mirrored doors. He pressed his palm to a panel, and the doors opened silently. I glanced behind. Luke and Mark were still chasing, and they were closing in.

The man pulled me inside with him, still holding my wrist. The doors closed, shutting out the noise, and shutting out everything. My heart pounded in my chest as the elevator began to rise.

“Where are we going?” I whispered, half afraid of the answer.

He turned his head slightly, his eyes burning into mine. “To my penthouse,” he said. “You’ll be safe there.”

Somehow, even with everything I had been through that day, I believed him. Maybe I had a natural penchant for falling into wrong hands.

# Mate

Scott

For centuries, the Lycans had ruled the werewolf race. They were stronger, faster, and nearly immortal, and were born kings. But time had not been kind. Wars, disease, and betrayal had cut their numbers until only I remained. I was the last Lycan alive, and I was the last Lycan king of the werewolves. At 28, the weight of my kind rested on my shoulders.

In order to survive, we moved into human cities and learned to live among them, blending into their world because we had no choice. We worked like them, dressed like them, and hid our true selves. To the humans, I was only Scott Moore, the young billionaire who owned the chain of Phoenix Malls and countless other businesses. If our true identities were discovered, it would mean the end of us.

Every year, Lycans went into a frenzy to rut for a week in order to mate. And it was that time of the year for me. I wanted to fuck every she-wolf or human I came in contact with, but I was restraining myself. I took heavy medication to stop my desires and lust.

And the Elders never let me forget my duty especially during this time. They said it was time I took a mate and produced heirs. They told me every day that my bloodline was too important to end with me, and that without me the werewolves would die out. It was me who gave them the power to exist. They wanted me to continue the Lycan line. But they didn’t understand the risk. Being a Lycan was different from being a normal werewolf. My power was stronger, heavier. If a female she-wolf carried my pup, she might not survive the birth.

Still, the Elders pushed me. “There are plenty of willing she-wolves,” they said. “They would give their lives for you.” They called it sacrifice. I called it madness. I wasn’t going to kill someone just to satisfy their demand. So I refused, again and again. I didn’t want an heir if it meant killing someone to get it.

This discussion again took place in the early morning meeting today. I pinched the bridge of my nose as I listened to them, waiting impatiently to get out of the meeting. As soon as it was done, I walked out of the room, and went for a swim to spend my energy and calm my anger and lust. I had an important meeting with human shareholders to attend next.

Thirty minutes later, I reached that meeting with my Beta, Troy. Troy explained a new plan to the shareholders about dividends. I sat at the head of the table, listening intently, when suddenly a scent hit me. It was that of sweet and warm chocolate and cinnamon. The smell was so strong it shook me. My Lycan stirred instantly. How could a chocolate cake smell so good? My throat went dry and my chest tightened. I couldn’t help the urge to eat it right away.

I tried to sit still, but the craving grew stronger with every second. My hands clenched on the table. What the hell was happening with me? The smell was pulling me like a chain.

I pushed back my chair and stood abruptly. Without a word, I left the meeting. Troy scrambled to follow. “Scott, what’s going on?” he asked as every shareholder looked at me with surprise.

I didn’t answer as I strode out of the meeting. The mouthwatering scent filled my lungs, guiding me through the corridors of Phoenix Mall. My Lycan was in full control now. I felt like a predator on the hunt. And that too for a chocolate and cinnamon cake? I loved dark chocolates, but this? My reaction was strange.

The trail led me to a quiet café. The smell was strong here. I opened the door and walked to the counter, scanning the cakes that got me so distracted. The girl behind the counter flustered, and blushed. It was a normal reaction of humans when they saw me. I continued to scan the cakes, and that’s when I heard a soft sniffle. I snapped my head in that direction.

A human girl sat at a table near the window. Her head was bent, her shoulders small and tense. She was crying quietly, her hand moving to her face again and again to wipe her tears. Before I knew it, my feet carried me in that direction, the smell growing stronger, coiling around my neck like a noose.

My Lycan growled one word that shook me to my core. MATE. The urge to rut surged like waves in a storm-tossed sea. ‘Mark her. Claim her. Rut her.’

I froze. My heart hammered in my chest hard. How was this possible? She was human. That couldn’t be right. The Moon Goddess wouldn’t bind me to a human. Yet every cell in my body knew it was true. She was mine. Mine to claim. And I wanted her madly, badly. She would never be able to carry my pups. But who cared?

I stared at her. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. She was soft, timid, and fragile-looking. She had disheveled blond hair, framing an innocent face, and eyes so emerald green they shone through her tears. My fingers twitched to feel the curves beneath her pink dress.

My Lycan was howling in joy, desire stirring inside him. ‘Take her. Rut her.’

I started moving toward her, my primal nature surging forth. Then, just as I got close, she stood up quickly, turned to the side and bumped into me.

Her small body collided with mine, and my arms reacted on their own. I caught her against me, holding her firmly against my chest. The shock of her touch was like electricity sparking through my body. My Lycan roared with triumph. ‘Mark her.’

She looked up at me, her eyes wide. For a second, we just stared at each other. My world tilted on its axis and then started rotating at a dizzying speed.

She glanced over my shoulder. I turned slightly and saw two men watching her. They were sitting a few tables away, staring in shock. My Lycan’s rage flared at once. Whoever they were, they had made her cry. For that alone, I wanted them dead.

Before I could do anything, she grabbed my shirt and kissed me, shocking the hell out of me. I froze. Then I felt her soft lips against mine, desperate and trembling, and everything inside me snapped. I never wanted the kiss to end.

I hated it when she pulled away. She whispered quickly against my lips. “Please, bear with me. Keep up the act for a minute.”

She thought this was an act? She had no idea what I was going through. But I saw the fear in her eyes, the desperation. I nodded. I would play along, for now.

‘No. Mark her. Rut her.’

Her enemies were still watching. My anger burned hot. So I kissed her back possessively, pulling her closer. The taste of her, the warmth of her mouth, the way her hands clutched at me. It all set me on fire, addling my mind. My Lycan howled in pure joy. ‘Ours.’

After our kiss, I led her out of the café, keeping her close. People stared, but no one said a word. Through the mind link, I called Troy. ‘Some men are chasing me. If they try to follow me, stop them. If they resist, kill them.’

‘Yes, Alpha,’ Troy replied instantly, sounding worried. ‘But where are you? You vanished faster than smoke.’

I gritted my teeth. ‘Near Moon Cafe.’

I didn’t slow down and pulled her with me toward the private elevators only I had access to. She didn’t fight me. Her steps matched mine, small and quick. I felt the trembling in her hand, and I squeezed them softly.

The doors slid open, and I guided her inside my penthouse. She looked up at me like a little lamb, unbeknownst that she had walked into a wolf’s den.

“You’re safe now,” I said reassuringly. “No one can reach you here.”

The doors closed behind us, shutting out the world. For the first time in a long time, I felt calm, satisfied, and grounded. Like I had found what I’d been waiting for all my life. My beautiful mate. In my home.

And I wasn’t going to let her go because I was going to announce her to the Elders tomorrow.

# You Are Divine

Bella

The elevator opened into a quiet, beautiful penthouse. I didn’t look around much. I went straight to the first couch I saw and sat down. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Tears came again. I tried to wipe them away, but they wouldn’t stop. I didn’t want to show myself as a damsel in distress to a stranger. But what could I do? My chest hurt so much, the betrayal being fresh.

He stood a few steps away, watching me. “Do you want something?” he asked softly, carefully.

I shook my head. “I-I’ll just leave in some time. Th-thanks for helping me.”

He walked to a bar cabinet and came back with a glass of wine. When I didn’t take it, he crouched in front of me, and set it on the table in front of me. In a low voice, he stared into my eyes and said, “Drink. It will calm you.”

I picked up the glass, stared at it, and gulped it down.

“More?” he asked. When I nodded, he brought the bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured more. It burned a little, warmed my throat, and turned my crying into hiccups. I took another as he watched me without judging, but I saw his jaw tighten once. He went to sit on the armrest of the sofa.

After a while, the heat spread through me and blunted the edge of deep sorrow. I felt better. I looked up at him. He was quiet, watching me with his sharp gaze. “My fiancé cheated on me with my stepsister,” I said finally. “We were supposed to marry in three days, and I found them having sex today.”

“He doesn’t deserve you,” he growled animalistically.

I clenched my teeth and became quiet for a few minutes. Then, I said hesitantly, “I want to ask you something.”

“Ask,” he replied, his voice rough, studying me like he was committing my features to his memory.

“Am I… pretty enough?”

For a second, he was startled. “Pretty? You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” he breathed. Then he did the most bizarre thing. He tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. “You are so pretty that I can have sex with you right now.”

My lips parted in surprise at his blatant readiness. Like the word hesitation didn’t exist in his dictionary? I asked, “Do you offer yourself for sex to strangers like this?”

His gaze became more intense. “No, usually, it’s the strangers who offer themselves to me every time. But I have offered myself to anyone for the first time. You can take advantage of my body. You know, like revenge sex?”

I licked my lip, blushing. I wanted to end this feeling of feeling used. He was staring at me to gauge my reaction. I wanted to refuse even though the idea of revenge sex was enticing.

He insisted, “Trust me, I’d be happy to be used by you.”

I blushed harder, and bit my bottom lip. He came forward, crouched in front me and pulled my bottom lip out. “You won’t regret it,” he said, watching my lips. He was so close that his body’s heat seeped inside me.

My breath faltered. I felt like I was being hypnotized by him. What was he doing to me? “Umm…” An ache developed between my thighs. Craig was never able to elicit this reaction in me.

His nostrils flared as he searched my face a moment longer. “I won’t touch you unless you want it,” he said, becoming tense.

I gulped down more wine, and then nodded, “Okay!” I think it was the wine speaking on my behalf.

His shoulders eased as if he was holding tension inside him. He got up, slid one arm under my knees and the other behind my back, and lifted me like I weighed nothing. I gasped as I wrapped my arms around his neck. Up close, he was even more beautiful. Being carried by him felt oddly safe. He walked into a bedroom that was exquisitely furnished.

He set me on the edge of the bed and took a step back, giving me space. “We can stop at any time,” he said as if through a lot of restraint. “You only have to say the word.”

I looked at my hands, then at him. I stood and reached for the zipper of my dress. My fingers fumbled. He came close and eased the zipper down without touching my skin. The dress slid to the floor. I stood there in simple lingerie, feeling shy.

His breath hitched as he took my body in. “You are divine,” he said, like he meant every word. “You don’t need to prove anything to anyone.”

I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. He moved with a calm I needed, speaking to me in short, steady sentences that told me I was safe, and in control. When he kissed me, it wasn’t rushed. He waited for me to respond. When I did, he deepened it, but always let me lead.

He removed his clothes, and when we finally lay down naked, he paused again. “Are you still sure?”

“Yes,” I said as I moved my fingers over his tattooed body. There was a tattoo of a wolf on his chest with vines that ran all the way to his shoulders and arms. God must have taken his time to sculpt this masterpiece.

He cupped my face and kissed me. When his lips met mine, and the world seemed to vanish. My breath hitched, my heart racing as warmth spread through me. His mouth moved against mine desperately with a hunger that made me tremble, like he couldn’t get enough of me. I found myself melting into his arms, my fingers clutching at him. The taste of him was sweet and intoxicating, making me forget everything but the fire between us. Every second his kiss pulled me deeper into him, until I no longer knew where I ended and he began. It was pure, consuming passion.

He went lower to my breasts and sucked my nipples hard. My body hummed with need so intense that I whimpered. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmured reverently. He went lower, lower and kissed my belly button.

“Ah!” I moaned.

He went down to my sex, and stared at it for a long moment. And then he blew hot air over it, and parted my lips.",1,1766131539.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

It would make more sense to make smaller decorative items time-contingent instead. That way, players could establish the base of their décor early and still have the café look cohesive while gradually adding details to finish the look throughout the event. As it’s currently structured, the café can feel unfinished for most of the event.

I get wanting to do a “12 Days of Christmas” style rollout, but:

    •	The event lasts 14 days
    
    •	It started on December 19
    
    •	And full access to all furniture items (including the couch and pitcher) isn’t available until January 2

It just feels poorly timed and overly restrictive for a cozy decorating game. Christmas will be over for more than a week by the time players have logged in enough days and accumulated enough currency to actually buy and place the furniture. Normally, décor is available in the shop (with some items paid), which gives players flexibility. This version punishes anyone who misses a single day and delays the most important décor until the holiday is already over.

Daily rewards are fine, but locking the core aesthetic behind perfect attendance removes a lot of the joy. Cozy games shouldn’t feel like a streak-based obligation.

1pqfktt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PPCTalks/comments/1pqfktt/how_ppc_payperclick_advertising_actually_works/,How PPC (Pay-Per-Click) Advertising Actually Works,"I see PPC mentioned everywhere (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.), but a lot of people don’t really explain *how it works*, so here’s a simple breakdown.

**What PPC is:**  
You only pay **when someone clicks** your ad. Not when it shows—only when it gets clicked.

# How PPC works (step by step)

1. **You choose keywords or targeting**
   * Google Ads → keywords people search (“best running shoes”)
   * Facebook/Instagram → audiences (interests, behaviors, demographics)
2. **You set a bid**
   * This is the *max* you’re willing to pay for one click
   * Example: “I’ll pay up to $2 per click”
3. **An auction happens (instantly)**
   * Every time someone searches or scrolls, platforms run a lightning-fast auction
   * It’s **not just highest bidder wins**
4. **Ad Rank decides who shows**
   * Platforms consider:
      * Your bid
      * Ad quality / relevance
      * Expected click-through rate
      * Landing page experience
   * A better ad can beat a higher bidder
5. **Your ad shows**
   * On Google: search results or partner sites
   * On social: in feeds, stories, reels, etc.
6. **Someone clicks**
   * You pay the actual cost (often *less* than your max bid)
7. **They land on your page**
   * The goal is usually:
      * Buy something
      * Sign up
      * Download
      * Contact you

# Why PPC can be powerful

* You can start getting traffic **immediately**
* Easy to track ROI
* Highly targeted
* Scales fast if profitable

# Why PPC can fail

* Bad targeting
* Weak ad copy
* Slow or confusing landing pages
* Paying for clicks that don’t convert

# Simple example

You sell coffee mugs.

* Bid: $1 per click
* 100 clicks = $100 spent
* 5 sales at $30 each = $150 revenue → $50 profit (before product costs)

**TL;DR:**  
PPC = you bid to show ads → platform runs auctions → better ads win → you pay only when clicked → profit depends on conversion, not traffic.

Bella

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.

Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.

“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”

She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”

“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”

“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”

I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”

But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.

I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.

After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.

The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrilled that I said yes right away. We fixed a wedding date with our families. We booked the hall, picked flowers, and chose the cake. I kept a list for everything, doing things personally even though my father had a fleet of personnel to work for me.

As soon as Lucy left our wedding boutique, I snuck out. I put the gown in my car and drove to Craig’s apartment. I had a key he gave me months ago. He had said, “Use it when you want to surprise me.” I smiled at the memory. The building had a private elevator. I rode up and stepped into his foyer.

The living room was quiet. I set the garment bag on the sofa and called out softly, “Craig?” There was no answer. His shoes were by the door, and his jacket was on a chair. He had to be home.

I walked down the hall toward the bedroom. As I got closer, I saw a trail of clothes on the floor. A red lace top, a silk skirt, bra and panties, and a pair of heels tipped on their sides. I stopped and blinked. It looked like someone undressed in a hurry. I smiled to myself. “Must be Evan,” I whispered. Craig’s younger cousin liked to drop by without warning with a date. I rolled my eyes and decided to leave. I picked up the garment bag and turned to go when I heard a soft sound. It was a low breathy moan from Craig’s bedroom. Feeling embarrassed, I increased my pace. But froze the next moment when a man’s voice came through the door, rough and loud. “Mayaaaa!”

Shock rippled through me and I stopped moving. Was that Craig’s voice? No, God, no. My first thought was that I misheard. My stepsister, Maya, hadn’t come back to the city in four years. She never showed her face to us even once ever since she left after that fight. I turned over my shoulder to look at the half-closed bedroom door. Despite myself, I turned back. I reached and saw that the door was slightly open. The room was dim, but I could see enough.

Craig was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair fell across the pillow. He was holding her, naked, and moving inside her. He said her name again, “Oh, Maya!”

Everything in me went quiet as my mind numbed in shock. I stood there for a few seconds, my hands turning clammy, my heart thundering. Craig and Maya together? When did this happen? I had read about this happening in books. You know, just fiction. But this cliché happened in real life as well?

The world tilted so fast I felt dizzy. I slapped my hand on my mouth to stop the sound of my gasp. My mind clicked through little details when I turned around. I noticed a glass of water on the nightstand was half full. There was a smudge of lipstick on the rim. There was a small backpack in the corner with a labubu doll, which was Maya’s. I stepped back, the hallway suddenly too long, the air too thin. I couldn’t breathe.

Unable to process the shock, I turned and went back to the living room. I picked up the garment bag with both hands, opened the door, and walked out.

Inside the elevator, I looked at the reflection of my 23 year old self. Through my pale face, my green eyes stared at me, my blond hair sticking to my face, which was covered with sweat. It was then that I broke down. A sob tore from me making my body shudder. The betrayal was too much to bear. But anger also surged through me, and suddenly I wanted to confront them. How could they do this to me?

So without thinking twice, I went back to his apartment to confront them.

# A Video

Bella

I stood in the hallway and tried to breathe, wondering what I was doing? Should I go in? My confidence wavered.

But I wanted to open the door and shout at them, make them face me. I wanted to ask why, since when, and how could they betray me. I wanted to look at Maya and say, “You stole my fiancé.”

My steps faltered because I also knew how Maya was. She would deny everything in front of our father. She would say I was jealous and that I was lying. Just like last time. She would cry like she had done before. Just before leaving home, she played a victim card, making me look like the villain of her life.

But I wanted to ask Craig if any of the last five years meant anything. Gathering courage and wiping my tears, I walked into the apartment.

Just as I reached outside the bedroom, I heard Maya’s soft and smug voice. She said, “You’ve kept it a secret for four years. I’m so proud of you, Craig. You’re awesome! I only wanted to finish college and then marry you. I couldn’t bear to see my stepsister have your kids.”

Craig laughed. “Bella’s a moron,” he said. “She’s so blind in love with me she never notices anything. It was easy to manipulate her.”

Manipulate me? I stood still and held my breath, my tears silently slipping from my eyes once again.

Maya chuckled and spoke again in a sultry voice, “I’m waiting for your divorce. Then we can start our own business. I’ve been dreaming about it for so long!”

Craig sounded pleased. “Of course, love. I’ll divorce Bella in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to her husband. That’s what her grandfather wrote in his will. So, it will all come to us, baby. I only have to tolerate her for a month more.”

I pressed my palm to the wall because I felt like I might fall. My heart pounded in my ears. I knew about my inheritance. Everyone in the family knew that I would get it after marriage and lose it if I divorced within six months.

Maya chuckled. “You're smart, Craig Jones. Gosh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around the house like she owns everything. The bitch doesn’t know how fast her world is going to crumble. Then I will exact my revenge. After she loses her inheritance, her father will remove her from his will also,” she snickered.

Craig laughed hard. “You’re wicked, Maya. Just be patient for a few more weeks, baby. Then we will have it all!”

They had planned my downfall carefully for so long. If I confronted them, it would be the most foolish thing to do.

“Come, ride me, baby!” Craig said. “Let’s celebrate!”

Anger inside me erupted like a volcano. Celebrate my downfall? I wanted to teach them a lesson now. So I took out my phone, and started recording them. If I sent this video to my father, I was sure he would call off the marriage.

“Oh baby, you’re so good!” Craig said as Maya moved on him.

My hand shook so hard in anger that a few seconds later, my phone slipped down. Craig snapped his head toward me. “Bella!” he gasped, his eyes going wide.

Maya also turned sharply to see me, and her mouth dropped open. “Shit!”

I picked up the phone and rushed out.

Craig removed Maya from him and came after me. “Bella, Bella!”

“I don’t want to hear a thing from you!” I shouted, as I scrambled to send the video to Daddy.

“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t!”

I opened the door. “You both deserve to be exposed!”

“Stop this bullshit, Bella!” he roared. “No one will marry you except me! Your marriage with me is written in stone!”

“I’d rather die than marry you, cheater!” I shouted back through my tears. I pressed the button to send the video to my father.

Craig came after me. But I was out of the door by then. He stood naked on the door of his apartment, watching me leave. “Bellaaaa!” he roared. A few people came out of their apartments hearing the commotion. Good. They would see him naked, dripping in her juices.

I left the apartment building as fast as I could, and went to my car. On the road, the city lights blurred a little. I blinked, trying to clear my vision. My mind played back the words I had just heard. ‘It was a secret for five years’. ‘Divorce in a month’. ‘Twenty million inheritance gone’. ‘Tolerate her for a month more’. ‘I rubbed my chest as the betrayal hurt deep’.

I gripped the steering wheel. I thought about Lucy and her firmly denying me to meet Craig. Did she know? Was she helping them keep me away so I would not see anything? So that their plan was executed smoothly?

Then I thought about my father. If I called him now and told him what I saw, what I heard, would he believe me? No, he wouldn’t. That’s why I sent the video proof. He loved me, but he thought I was an “entitled brat.”

If I hadn’t recorded them in the act, Maya would lie through her teeth in front of him just to get the money. I didn’t trust Craig either. He would rather watch me suffer and make the marriage more miserable.

I remembered how four years ago, after high school, Maya left the house after a fight. She told everyone I was the reason. The house was full of tension for weeks. My father chose to calm Lucy and Maya instead of me. But despite his efforts, Maya left never to return. Since then, Daddy treated me like I might start another problem at any moment. He watched me like I was a risk to manage. He scolded me often because of Maya.

I remembered that fight like it happened yesterday. Maya had cried so much that day, her sobs filled every corner of the house. She stood in front of my father and her mother, acting like she was the victim. She said she would always be a stepsister and that I could never accept her. Then, with a trembling voice, she offered to leave the house so I could live “comfortably.” Lucy’s eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t protest. She only lowered her head and suffered quietly, as if Maya’s sacrifice was breaking her heart.

But the truth was different. The fight started because on the last day of our school, I had caught Maya with Luke. I had confessed to her a week before that I liked Luke.

I had seen her sitting close to him, cuddling him, kissing him on his lips. When I confronted her later, she smiled in a way she wasn’t ashamed. On the contrary, she flaunted her “victory”. “He never liked you!” she had said, flicking her hair.

The betrayal from Luke was nothing compared to the one from Maya. “You can have him,” I replied.

I stifled my feelings for Luke right after so that Maya could be with him. But I don’t know why Maya came home and created the drama, accusing me of just the opposite? She told our parents that it was me who kissed her boyfriend, Luke, and I hated her for being happy. My father believed her and scolded me to be more adjusting. But Maya left for college nonetheless, trapping me into guilt all this while.

It was during that painful time that Craig, Luke’s friend, stepped in. He comforted me, chased after me, and slowly, I fell in love with him. But now Maya had her claws in Craig as well. It was like she wanted to snatch everything I cherished.

# You'll Be Safe

Bella

I didn’t know where to go after leaving Craig’s apartment. My chest still hurt deep from the betrayal, and my thoughts kept circling the same question—how could Maya do this to me again?

Before I knew it, I was parking in front of the Phoenix Mall, the largest and grandest mall in the city. It had chains across the world, and I had heard that its CEO, Scott Moore, was a secretive sharp billionaire bachelor. He was arrogant, and cold, more handsome than God, and had hundreds of girls swooning over him.

I wandered through the bright halls of the mall and walked into a quiet café. The smell of coffee and baked bread wafted in the air. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at a small table by the window. The moment the cup was in my hands, tears started to fall again. I tried to wipe them quickly, but they kept coming. I cried quietly, hoping no one noticed. I couldn’t believe my life had come to this. How was I supposed to stop a marriage my whole family had already planned? Would my father believe the video content? I wondered if I should make the video viral.

Just as I lowered my head to sip my coffee, the door opened, and two men walked in. My heart skipped. It was Luke and Mark, Craig’s friends. Luke was the same boy who I liked in high school before Maya destroyed it all. I quickly bent my head lower, hoping they wouldn’t notice me. They sat two tables behind me, talking and laughing. I couldn’t help but overhear them.

“Bella has always been a moron,” Luke chuckled, stirring his coffee. “She never noticed Craig and Maya were in love. Stupid blind brat. Maya is back in town and she'll be staying with me for a while.”

Mark laughed loudly. “But it works for us, Luke. Craig smartly handled Bella after you goofed up with her. Once he gets Bella’s inheritance, we’re set. Our contracts with him are already drafted. The moment the money comes, we’ll sign. Our businesses will finally take off. Only a month before final goodbye to the bitch!” They both laughed again.

My blood went cold. I clutched my cup so tightly I thought it might break. Their words sank in slowly but clearly. They were all in on it. Craig, Maya, Luke, and Mark. They weren’t just betraying me with love. They were plotting around my inheritance. My stomach twisted, bitterness coating my soul. This all was happening behind my back ever since high school, and like a fool, I never came to know. How gullible I was?

Anger burned in my chest. I wanted to go to their table and confront them, scream that I had come to know it all. On an impulse, I pushed my chair back and stood up quickly. But the moment I turned, I collided with someone. Arms gripped me instantly to stop me from falling.

I craned my neck up, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. A beautiful man, towering over me with broad shoulders, filled the space. He was wearing a pinstripe suit. His face was striking with a sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and dark eyes so intense they seemed to glow. His lips were firm and bow-shaped, his nose straight, his black hair falling just slightly across his forehead. He looked unreal, like a man who didn’t belong to this world. Like a king who ruled the world.

I noticed that there was complete silence in the café now. In that instant, an idea lit up in my mind. A reckless, desperate plan that could actually break the marriage.

I tilted my head slightly, giving Luke and Mark a sidelong glance, then turned back to the man. Without giving myself time to think, I pressed my lips against his.

He growled low in his throat as his hand shot out and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me close. It was protective, possessive, and startling all at once. My body went stiff in his arms, but from the corner of my eyes, I saw Luke and Mark watching us. Their mouths had fallen open. Everyone in the café had turned to stare.

The kiss was quick at first, just enough for everyone to see. I whispered against his lips, “Please, could you keep up the act for a minute?”

To my surprise, he didn’t push me away. Instead, his hand tightened on my waist, and he kissed me back. His lips were warm and commanding. He deepened the kiss, and the world around me blurred. His kiss was passionate, strong, almost overwhelming. For a moment, I forgot why I even started it. I felt my knees weaken, and I had to hold on to his shirt to stay steady.

When we finally broke apart, the café was completely silent. My lips tingled, my cheeks burned, and I couldn’t get a hold of myself. Like my whole body was on fire. 

But I knew Luke and Mark had seen everything. Now they would inform Craig or my father about it. So if the video didn’t work, this would.

“Could you please walk out with me from the café?” I asked softly. “I want them to see it clearly,” I said, darting my eyes to Luke and Mark.

“Do you want me to make them disappear from the face of the earth?” he asked seriously, his intense eyes locked on mine.

My mouth dropped. Was he a mafia boss? I let out a nervous chuckle. “N-no!”

Without waiting, he grabbed my wrist and walked with me toward the door. I glanced back. Luke and Mark had jumped up, chasing us. Panic rushed through me. I pulled closer to the man and whispered urgently, “Please, help me. Hide me for a few hours. I want to escape them.” Now I was afraid that they would confront me and manhandle me.

His dark eyes cut to me. “You shouldn’t trust strangers,” he said in a low and rough voice.

I faltered, my lips parting. I didn’t know what to say. I felt foolish and desperate. But then his eyes softened. “But I’ll save you,” he said.

Something in me believed him instantly. I couldn’t explain why. It was pure instinct.

He led me quickly to a side hallway I hadn’t even noticed before. At the end was a private elevator, hidden behind mirrored doors. He pressed his palm to a panel, and the doors opened silently. I glanced behind. Luke and Mark were still chasing, and they were closing in.

The man pulled me inside with him, still holding my wrist. The doors closed, shutting out the noise, and shutting out everything. My heart pounded in my chest as the elevator began to rise.

“Where are we going?” I whispered, half afraid of the answer.

He turned his head slightly, his eyes burning into mine. “To my penthouse,” he said. “You’ll be safe there.”

Somehow, even with everything I had been through that day, I believed him. Maybe I had a natural penchant for falling into wrong hands.

# Mate

Scott

For centuries, the Lycans had ruled the werewolf race. They were stronger, faster, and nearly immortal, and were born kings. But time had not been kind. Wars, disease, and betrayal had cut their numbers until only I remained. I was the last Lycan alive, and I was the last Lycan king of the werewolves. At 28, the weight of my kind rested on my shoulders.

In order to survive, we moved into human cities and learned to live among them, blending into their world because we had no choice. We worked like them, dressed like them, and hid our true selves. To the humans, I was only Scott Moore, the young billionaire who owned the chain of Phoenix Malls and countless other businesses. If our true identities were discovered, it would mean the end of us.

Every year, Lycans went into a frenzy to rut for a week in order to mate. And it was that time of the year for me. I wanted to fuck every she-wolf or human I came in contact with, but I was restraining myself. I took heavy medication to stop my desires and lust.

And the Elders never let me forget my duty especially during this time. They said it was time I took a mate and produced heirs. They told me every day that my bloodline was too important to end with me, and that without me the werewolves would die out. It was me who gave them the power to exist. They wanted me to continue the Lycan line. But they didn’t understand the risk. Being a Lycan was different from being a normal werewolf. My power was stronger, heavier. If a female she-wolf carried my pup, she might not survive the birth.

Still, the Elders pushed me. “There are plenty of willing she-wolves,” they said. “They would give their lives for you.” They called it sacrifice. I called it madness. I wasn’t going to kill someone just to satisfy their demand. So I refused, again and again. I didn’t want an heir if it meant killing someone to get it.

This discussion again took place in the early morning meeting today. I pinched the bridge of my nose as I listened to them, waiting impatiently to get out of the meeting. As soon as it was done, I walked out of the room, and went for a swim to spend my energy and calm my anger and lust. I had an important meeting with human shareholders to attend next.

Thirty minutes later, I reached that meeting with my Beta, Troy. Troy explained a new plan to the shareholders about dividends. I sat at the head of the table, listening intently, when suddenly a scent hit me. It was that of sweet and warm chocolate and cinnamon. The smell was so strong it shook me. My Lycan stirred instantly. How could a chocolate cake smell so good? My throat went dry and my chest tightened. I couldn’t help the urge to eat it right away.

I tried to sit still, but the craving grew stronger with every second. My hands clenched on the table. What the hell was happening with me? The smell was pulling me like a chain.

I pushed back my chair and stood abruptly. Without a word, I left the meeting. Troy scrambled to follow. “Scott, what’s going on?” he asked as every shareholder looked at me with surprise.

I didn’t answer as I strode out of the meeting. The mouthwatering scent filled my lungs, guiding me through the corridors of Phoenix Mall. My Lycan was in full control now. I felt like a predator on the hunt. And that too for a chocolate and cinnamon cake? I loved dark chocolates, but this? My reaction was strange.

The trail led me to a quiet café. The smell was strong here. I opened the door and walked to the counter, scanning the cakes that got me so distracted. The girl behind the counter flustered, and blushed. It was a normal reaction of humans when they saw me. I continued to scan the cakes, and that’s when I heard a soft sniffle. I snapped my head in that direction.

A human girl sat at a table near the window. Her head was bent, her shoulders small and tense. She was crying quietly, her hand moving to her face again and again to wipe her tears. Before I knew it, my feet carried me in that direction, the smell growing stronger, coiling around my neck like a noose.

My Lycan growled one word that shook me to my core. MATE. The urge to rut surged like waves in a storm-tossed sea. ‘Mark her. Claim her. Rut her.’

I froze. My heart hammered in my chest hard. How was this possible? She was human. That couldn’t be right. The Moon Goddess wouldn’t bind me to a human. Yet every cell in my body knew it was true. She was mine. Mine to claim. And I wanted her madly, badly. She would never be able to carry my pups. But who cared?

I stared at her. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. She was soft, timid, and fragile-looking. She had disheveled blond hair, framing an innocent face, and eyes so emerald green they shone through her tears. My fingers twitched to feel the curves beneath her pink dress.

My Lycan was howling in joy, desire stirring inside him. ‘Take her. Rut her.’

I started moving toward her, my primal nature surging forth. Then, just as I got close, she stood up quickly, turned to the side and bumped into me.

Her small body collided with mine, and my arms reacted on their own. I caught her against me, holding her firmly against my chest. The shock of her touch was like electricity sparking through my body. My Lycan roared with triumph. ‘Mark her.’

She looked up at me, her eyes wide. For a second, we just stared at each other. My world tilted on its axis and then started rotating at a dizzying speed.

She glanced over my shoulder. I turned slightly and saw two men watching her. They were sitting a few tables away, staring in shock. My Lycan’s rage flared at once. Whoever they were, they had made her cry. For that alone, I wanted them dead.

Before I could do anything, she grabbed my shirt and kissed me, shocking the hell out of me. I froze. Then I felt her soft lips against mine, desperate and trembling, and everything inside me snapped. I never wanted the kiss to end.

I hated it when she pulled away. She whispered quickly against my lips. “Please, bear with me. Keep up the act for a minute.”

She thought this was an act? She had no idea what I was going through. But I saw the fear in her eyes, the desperation. I nodded. I would play along, for now.

‘No. Mark her. Rut her.’

Her enemies were still watching. My anger burned hot. So I kissed her back possessively, pulling her closer. The taste of her, the warmth of her mouth, the way her hands clutched at me. It all set me on fire, addling my mind. My Lycan howled in pure joy. ‘Ours.’

After our kiss, I led her out of the café, keeping her close. People stared, but no one said a word. Through the mind link, I called Troy. ‘Some men are chasing me. If they try to follow me, stop them. If they resist, kill them.’

‘Yes, Alpha,’ Troy replied instantly, sounding worried. ‘But where are you? You vanished faster than smoke.’

I gritted my teeth. ‘Near Moon Cafe.’

I didn’t slow down and pulled her with me toward the private elevators only I had access to. She didn’t fight me. Her steps matched mine, small and quick. I felt the trembling in her hand, and I squeezed them softly.

The doors slid open, and I guided her inside my penthouse. She looked up at me like a little lamb, unbeknownst that she had walked into a wolf’s den.

“You’re safe now,” I said reassuringly. “No one can reach you here.”

The doors closed behind us, shutting out the world. For the first time in a long time, I felt calm, satisfied, and grounded. Like I had found what I’d been waiting for all my life. My beautiful mate. In my home.

And I wasn’t going to let her go because I was going to announce her to the Elders tomorrow.

# You Are Divine

Bella

The elevator opened into a quiet, beautiful penthouse. I didn’t look around much. I went straight to the first couch I saw and sat down. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Tears came again. I tried to wipe them away, but they wouldn’t stop. I didn’t want to show myself as a damsel in distress to a stranger. But what could I do? My chest hurt so much, the betrayal being fresh.

He stood a few steps away, watching me. “Do you want something?” he asked softly, carefully.

I shook my head. “I-I’ll just leave in some time. Th-thanks for helping me.”

He walked to a bar cabinet and came back with a glass of wine. When I didn’t take it, he crouched in front of me, and set it on the table in front of me. In a low voice, he stared into my eyes and said, “Drink. It will calm you.”

I picked up the glass, stared at it, and gulped it down.

“More?” he asked. When I nodded, he brought the bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured more. It burned a little, warmed my throat, and turned my crying into hiccups. I took another as he watched me without judging, but I saw his jaw tighten once. He went to sit on the armrest of the sofa.

After a while, the heat spread through me and blunted the edge of deep sorrow. I felt better. I looked up at him. He was quiet, watching me with his sharp gaze. “My fiancé cheated on me with my stepsister,” I said finally. “We were supposed to marry in three days, and I found them having sex today.”

“He doesn’t deserve you,” he growled animalistically.

I clenched my teeth and became quiet for a few minutes. Then, I said hesitantly, “I want to ask you something.”

“Ask,” he replied, his voice rough, studying me like he was committing my features to his memory.

“Am I… pretty enough?”

For a second, he was startled. “Pretty? You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” he breathed. Then he did the most bizarre thing. He tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. “You are so pretty that I can have sex with you right now.”

My lips parted in surprise at his blatant readiness. Like the word hesitation didn’t exist in his dictionary? I asked, “Do you offer yourself for sex to strangers like this?”

His gaze became more intense. “No, usually, it’s the strangers who offer themselves to me every time. But I have offered myself to anyone for the first time. You can take advantage of my body. You know, like revenge sex?”

I licked my lip, blushing. I wanted to end this feeling of feeling used. He was staring at me to gauge my reaction. I wanted to refuse even though the idea of revenge sex was enticing.

He insisted, “Trust me, I’d be happy to be used by you.”

I blushed harder, and bit my bottom lip. He came forward, crouched in front me and pulled my bottom lip out. “You won’t regret it,” he said, watching my lips. He was so close that his body’s heat seeped inside me.

My breath faltered. I felt like I was being hypnotized by him. What was he doing to me? “Umm…” An ache developed between my thighs. Craig was never able to elicit this reaction in me.

His nostrils flared as he searched my face a moment longer. “I won’t touch you unless you want it,” he said, becoming tense.

I gulped down more wine, and then nodded, “Okay!” I think it was the wine speaking on my behalf.

His shoulders eased as if he was holding tension inside him. He got up, slid one arm under my knees and the other behind my back, and lifted me like I weighed nothing. I gasped as I wrapped my arms around his neck. Up close, he was even more beautiful. Being carried by him felt oddly safe. He walked into a bedroom that was exquisitely furnished.

He set me on the edge of the bed and took a step back, giving me space. “We can stop at any time,” he said as if through a lot of restraint. “You only have to say the word.”

I looked at my hands, then at him. I stood and reached for the zipper of my dress. My fingers fumbled. He came close and eased the zipper down without touching my skin. The dress slid to the floor. I stood there in simple lingerie, feeling shy.

His breath hitched as he took my body in. “You are divine,” he said, like he meant every word. “You don’t need to prove anything to anyone.”

I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. He moved with a calm I needed, speaking to me in short, steady sentences that told me I was safe, and in control. When he kissed me, it wasn’t rushed. He waited for me to respond. When I did, he deepened it, but always let me lead.

He removed his clothes, and when we finally lay down naked, he paused again. “Are you still sure?”

“Yes,” I said as I moved my fingers over his tattooed body. There was a tattoo of a wolf on his chest with vines that ran all the way to his shoulders and arms. God must have taken his time to sculpt this masterpiece.

He cupped my face and kissed me. When his lips met mine, and the world seemed to vanish. My breath hitched, my heart racing as warmth spread through me. His mouth moved against mine desperately with a hunger that made me tremble, like he couldn’t get enough of me. I found myself melting into his arms, my fingers clutching at him. The taste of him was sweet and intoxicating, making me forget everything but the fire between us. Every second his kiss pulled me deeper into him, until I no longer knew where I ended and he began. It was pure, consuming passion.

He went lower to my breasts and sucked my nipples hard. My body hummed with need so intense that I whimpered. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmured reverently. He went lower, lower and kissed my belly button.

“Ah!” I moaned.

He went down to my sex, and stared at it for a long moment. And then he blew hot air over it, and parted my lips.

This also doesn’t count the 10 games or so I’m currently working my way through (hopefully lol)

Here’s to hoping I can finish 20 or so of those great ones next year.

1pqfj5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1pqfj5e/family_revenge_required/,Family Revenge Required,"Hi! I F19 currently am living at home while saving up money to move out (working while in school, commuting to campus to save money) I live with both parents, 3 brothers (23, 21, 17), and 2 dogs. As you can probably tell from the background I have given, there has been ongoing issues in my household specifically with my 23 year old brother. He’s dropped out of college, been fired from almost every job he’s worked, and has had no regard for anyone’s belongings including his own. Some examples 1. I like having sugar free vanilla syrup to make vanilla cokes or use in my ninja creami when I’m dieting. I have to write my name on the bottle at least 10 times (obviously this isn’t the first occurrence) to try to and prevent my brother from using it. I didn’t use it for maybe 2 weeks and discovered my brother used 2/3 of the bottle even with my name written on the side. “I didn’t think you needed it” and “it’s probably not that expensive” were the excuses I was given. 2. He leaves dirty pots and pans out EVERY DAY. My parents ask him every time to clean up after himself and he ignores them, which causes my parents to be pissed at him 95% of the time. 3. He leaves wet towels behind my brother’s bathroom door and stacks them until the door won’t open all the way. Why he needs a new towel this often? Don’t know. So we’ve had to add a handle with a lock to the towel closet in our house. 4. my younger brother needed to get a handle with a lock for his closet door because my oldest brother has begun stealing his clothes from his closet. Now he has started taking them directly from the washer/dryer. Again, he has plenty of his own clothes. 5. He racked up $750+ on my mom’s credit card. My mom has given each of us an emergency credit card in case we are ever stuck somewhere or in a situation where we might need it, but it’s for emergency or authorized use only. My brother ran up that massive bill on massages for him and his gf, eating out, etc. My mom took the money out of every paycheck he had until she was paid back, but it was still hell to live through the constant fighting. 5. I like to dabble in a lot of creative things (music, drawing, painting, crochet, sewing, etc.) a few months ago he spilled coffee all over my sewing machine and only told me because I walked downstairs in the middle of the sorry excuse of a cleanup. Well, this is what pushed me over the edge tonight and led me to Reddit. I decided to clean and organize my sewing table. When I went to the basement counter to retrieve my new sewing patterns(I hadn’t had the chance to put them away) I discovered they were covered in coffee stains, wrinkled, and almost certainly ruined. This had to have happened a few weeks ago, again, I was not told a damn thing. It’s almost like he intentionally chose the one spot on the counter where my patterns were. 6. He’s thrown out almost all of our Tupperware and silverware because he’s too lazy to clean it. The silverware set my parents have had for over 20 years (it was a wedding present) slowly started disappearing over the last few weeks. My mom caught my brother throwing them out because he didn’t want to clean them. She bought a new set but refuses to get them out until my brother moves out (I better get used to not having forks or spoons) I cannot take it anymore. This is the list I came up with while trying to keep my frustration brief. My younger brother and I went to my parents again and asked them to get him to leave the house. They’ve told him in the past they would kick him out at the end of the month but they always go back on their word.  My dad is convinced he will “die on the street” if they kick him out now (he has no money saved because he gets chipotle/eats out twice a day multiple times a week) My parents told us “well there’s nothing we can do” so I guess I’m out of luck in that department. Upon seeing my new sewing patterns in a coffee-soaked state, I decided that my only option is to take revenge my own way. So I’ve started by taking all of his stupid bags of flavored coffee and hiding them. When he buys me new sewing patterns he can have them back. So I am asking, begging, and pleading…what are the best petty revenge ideas? What can I do to try and bring discipline back to this household? Is there anything I can say to my parents to try and convince them to end this madness??? Again I’m saving up to move out but I still have to go multiple months before I’m ready.

1pqffbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pqffbz/aita_for_letting_my_doctor_threaten_my_mil_with/,AITA for letting my doctor threaten my MIL with adult protective services after she contaminated our kitchen with my allergens because she thinks my anaphylaxis is FAKE?,"My mother-in-law sent me to urgent care because she thinks veganism is a ""phase"" and I need to ""stop being dramatic.""

I'm severely allergic to dairy and eggs. Not intolerant, allergic. Like my throat closes up and I break out in hives allergic. I've been this way since I was twelve. My husband has known this our entire relationship, seven years. His mother has known this for seven years too.

Last Tuesday my husband and I both had to work late. We're talking 10+ hour shifts. His mom offered to come by and ""tidy up"" while we were gone since she has our spare key. I thought she meant like, doing dishes or vacuuming. I said sure, thank you, that would be really helpful.

We got home around 9pm and I was starving. I went straight to the kitchen to heat up the leftover lentil soup I'd made. It wasn't in the fridge. Neither was the tofu stir fry. Or the chickpea salad. Or the almond milk. Or literally any of the food I'd bought.

The fridge was full of stuff though. Whole milk. Regular butter. Eggs. Chicken breasts. Cheese. A tuna casserole with a note that said ""Real food for when you're ready to stop this nonsense - Mom.""

I stood there staring at it for a solid minute because I couldn't process what I was seeing.

My husband came in and saw my face. ""What's wrong?""

""Your mom threw away all our food.""

He looked in the fridge. Then the freezer. Then the pantry. Everything plant-based was gone. She'd even thrown out the $40 specialty protein powder I use.

""Maybe she thought it was expired?"" he said.

""She left a note calling it nonsense.""

He called her. Put her on speaker.

""Oh honey, I was helping,"" she said when he asked. ""All that weird fake food, it's not healthy. I threw it out and got you real groceries. You're welcome.""

""Mom, you know she's allergic to dairy and eggs.""

""She's not allergic, she's picky. There's a difference.""

""She has an epipen.""

""Which she's never had to use around me because she's faking it for attention.""

I grabbed the phone. ""You threw away over $200 worth of food.""

""$200 on rabbit food, what a waste. Now you have real options.""

""I can't eat anything you bought. I'll go into anaphylaxis.""

""So dramatic. This is exactly what I mean. Everything is always about you and your special needs.""

She hung up.

My husband looked exhausted. ""I'll go to the store.""

""It's 9:30 and you worked a double shift.""

""So did you, and you haven't eaten since noon.""

I told him I'd just order something. He felt terrible but he was literally falling asleep standing up. I ordered from this vegan place across town, waited an hour, ate, went to bed angry.

The next morning I was still furious. I called my MIL.

""I want you to replace everything you threw away.""

""I'm not spending money on fake food.""

""Then venmo me $200.""

""For what?""

""The food you threw away without permission.""

She laughed. Actually laughed. ""You'll get over it. You always do. Drama queen.""

That night my throat started feeling weird. Then my skin got itchy. I'd used the coffee creamer from the fridge that morning without checking it, just poured it in out of habit while half asleep. It was the regular dairy creamer she'd bought, not my oat milk.

My husband was at work. I took benadryl but the itching got worse. Hives started showing up on my arms. My throat felt tight.

I drove myself to urgent care.

The doctor took one look at me and asked what I'd been exposed to. I explained about the dairy, about my allergy, about my MIL replacing all my food. He was pissed. Gave me a steroid shot and another antihistamine and told me I was lucky it wasn't worse.

""Does your mother-in-law understand you have a documented medical condition?""

""She thinks I'm faking.""

""Would you like me to speak with her?""

I gave him her number.

I could only hear his side but it was beautiful.

""This is Dr. Patterson from urgent care. Your daughter-in-law is here being treated for an allergic reaction... No ma'am, this is not for attention, this is anaphylaxis... She has hives covering 40% of her body and significant throat swelling... No, allergies are not a choice... Ma'am, what you did could have killed her... Replacing someone's safe food with their allergens is poisoning... Yes, I said poisoning... I'm documenting this visit as environmental contamination and I'm required to ask if she feels safe in her home...""

There was a long pause.

""She's declining to press charges at this time but I'm noting that option was discussed... Yes, you should take this seriously... Medical records don't lie, ma'am. Your daughter-in-law has carried an epipen for over a decade... No, veganism and food allergies are not the same thing... I need you to understand that if this happens again, we will have to involve adult protective services.""

He hung up and looked at me. ""She seems pleasant.""

""She's a peach.""

I got home an hour later. My husband was there, he'd left work early. His mom had called him ""hysterical"" about how I was ""trying to get her arrested"" and ""making doctors lie"" about my ""fake allergy.""

He took one look at my face, still covered in hives, and lost it.

""She poisoned you.""

""She didn't mean to...""

""She threw out your safe food and replaced it with things she KNOWS you're allergic to. That's not an accident.""

He called her back. Told her she was not welcome in our home anymore. Told her he was getting the spare key back this weekend. Told her that until she could respect that I have a medical condition and apologize, she wouldn't be seeing either of us.

She started crying, said he was choosing his ""dramatic wife"" over his own mother, said I'd always been manipulative and now I'd turned him against her.

He said ""Mom, she's covered in hives and just got back from urgent care because you contaminated our kitchen. This isn't drama, this is medical reality"" and hung up.

She's been blowing up our phones since. His dad called and said I should just ""keep the peace"" and ""you know how she is."" His sister said I was being vindictive by ""tattling to a doctor.""

My own parents said his mom was out of line but maybe we should have been clearer about the severity of my allergies.

I'm sitting here with hives still fading, a $150 urgent care bill, and a trashed kitchen I'm scared to use until we deep clean everything. And apparently I'm the problem.

So now I'm wondering if I took it too far by letting the doctor call her. AITAH?

Not in a dramatic or cinematic way, just in the way that matters. The kind that settles into my body without asking permission.

You feel like waking up on a Saturday morning when I was younger, before responsibilities had names. The house is already awake. The smell of pancakes and bacon drifts down the hall, coffee brewing somewhere out of sight. Nothing is urgent. Nothing is wrong. Just warmth and the quiet promise that the day is going to be okay.

You feel like hearing a song for the first time and knowing instantly that it belongs to you. No overthinking. No hesitation. Just that calm certainty as I add it to my playlist, already knowing I will want to come back to it again and again. The same comfort. The same ease.

You feel like a warm summer afternoon that stretches on without rushing. The sun lowers slowly after a day that did not need to be extraordinary to be good. The air is soft. The light is golden. There is nothing left to prove. Only the quiet satisfaction of time well spent.

I do not need you to fix anything. I do not need you to be anything other than what you already are. Being near you feels like exhaling after holding my breath longer than I realized. Like my nervous system finally believes the world is not a threat in this moment.

I will probably never tell you this. It is easier to carry it quietly and let it live here, where it cannot complicate anything. Still, I wanted to write it down somewhere, even if no one ever sees it.

Some people feel like home without ever trying. You are one of them.",7,1766130426.0,UnsentLetters,3,1.0,False

1pqfcbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1pqfcbl/dysfunction_junction/,Dysfunction Junction,"Hi! I F19 currently am living at home while saving up money to move out (working while in school, commuting to campus to save money) I live with both parents, 3 brothers (23, 21, 17), and 2 dogs. As you can probably tell from the background I have given, there has been ongoing issues in my household specifically with my 23 year old brother. He’s dropped out of college, been fired from almost every job he’s worked, and has had no regard for anyone’s belongings including his own. Some examples 1. I like having sugar free vanilla syrup to make vanilla cokes or use in my ninja creami when I’m dieting. I have to write my name on the bottle at least 10 times (obviously this isn’t the first occurrence) to try to and prevent my brother from using it. I didn’t use it for maybe 2 weeks and discovered my brother used 2/3 of the bottle even with my name written on the side. “I didn’t think you needed it” and “it’s probably not that expensive” were the excuses I was given. 2. He leaves dirty pots and pans out EVERY DAY. My parents ask him every time to clean up after himself and he ignores them, which causes my parents to be pissed at him 95% of the time. 3. He leaves wet towels behind my brother’s bathroom door and stacks them until the door won’t open all the way. Why he needs a new towel this often? Don’t know. So we’ve had to add a handle with a lock to the towel closet in our house. 4. my younger brother needed to get a handle with a lock for his closet door because my oldest brother has begun stealing his clothes from his closet. Now he has started taking them directly from the washer/dryer. Again, he has plenty of his own clothes. 5. He racked up $750+ on my mom’s credit card. My mom has given each of us an emergency credit card in case we are ever stuck somewhere or in a situation where we might need it, but it’s for emergency or authorized use only. My brother ran up that massive bill on massages for him and his gf, eating out, etc. My mom took the money out of every paycheck he had until she was paid back, but it was still hell to live through the constant fighting. 5. I like to dabble in a lot of creative things (music, drawing, painting, crochet, sewing, etc.) a few months ago he spilled coffee all over my sewing machine and only told me because I walked downstairs in the middle of the sorry excuse of a cleanup. Well, this is what pushed me over the edge tonight and led me to Reddit. I decided to clean and organize my sewing table. When I went to the basement counter to retrieve my new sewing patterns(I hadn’t had the chance to put them away) I discovered they were covered in coffee stains, wrinkled, and almost certainly ruined. This had to have happened a few weeks ago, again, I was not told a damn thing. It’s almost like he intentionally chose the one spot on the counter where my patterns were. 6. He’s thrown out almost all of our Tupperware and silverware because he’s too lazy to clean it. The silverware set my parents have had for over 20 years (it was a wedding present) slowly started disappearing over the last few weeks. My mom caught my brother throwing them out because he didn’t want to clean them. She bought a new set but refuses to get them out until my brother moves out (I better get used to not having forks or spoons) I cannot take it anymore. This is the list I came up with while trying to keep my frustration brief. My younger brother and I went to my parents again and asked them to get him to leave the house. They’ve told him in the past they would kick him out at the end of the month but they always go back on their word.  My dad is convinced he will “die on the street” if they kick him out now (he has no money saved because he gets chipotle/eats out twice a day multiple times a week) My parents told us “well there’s nothing we can do” so I guess I’m out of luck in that department. Upon seeing my new sewing patterns in a coffee-soaked state, I decided that my only option is to take revenge my own way. So I’ve started by taking all of his stupid bags of flavored coffee and hiding them. When he buys me new sewing patterns he can have them back. So I am asking, begging, and pleading…what are the best petty revenge ideas? What can I do to try and bring discipline back to this household? Is there anything I can say to my parents to try and convince them to end this madness??? Again I’m saving up to move out but I still have to go multiple months before I’m ready.

1pqfbuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnchorLessEurope/comments/1pqfbuq/planning_your_2026_budget_for_portugal_heres_what/,Planning your 2026 budget for Portugal? Here's what you need to know about what's getting more expensive (and what is not),"Hey everyone,

With 2026 just around the corner, I've been digging through a bunch of Portuguese news articles to get a clear picture of the economic changes heading our way. I wanted to put together a summary for the community, especially regarding how it affects our budgets and visa situations.

Here’s a breakdown of what to expect in 2026:

**The main one: minimum wage and how it affects Portuguese visas**

* **National Minimum Wage Increase:** The Portuguese minimum wage (SMN) is increasing from €870 to **€920 per month**.
* **Impact on Visas:** This is super important for anyone applying for or renewing a residence permit (D7, Digital Nomad, etc.). The financial sufficiency thresholds are tied to the SMN. This means the amount of money you need to show in your bank account will increase. If you have a visa application planned for 2026, make sure you recalculate your required funds based on the new €920 figure! For example, a monthly income for a single person D7 passsive income visa will be the minimum wage (€920), and for a single person D8 digital nomad visa, is 4 times the minimum wage (€3680). Along with that the proof of funds will also be affected, as you have to show a year's worth of the monimum wage on a Portuguese bank account (aka, €11.060 euros)

**Housing and rent**

* **Rent Increases:** Landlords will have the option to increase rent by **2.24%** in 2026. For a €1000/month rent, that's an extra €22.40.
   * **It's NOT automatic.** Your landlord must notify you in writing (registered letter or signed in person) at least 30 days before the increase takes effect.
   * **Warning:** Landlords who haven't raised the rent in the last three years can apply the coefficients from previous years cumulatively. This could lead to a much larger increase (one article mentioned a potential of over 11%), so check your contract and past payments.
* **IRS Deduction:** A small silver lining, as the maximum amount of rent you can deduct on your IRS tax return is set to rise from €700 to **€750**, with a potential to go up to €900.

**Cost of living: what's getting more expensive**

* **Groceries:** Brace yourselves for higher food bills. The head of the Portuguese Association of Distribution Companies (APED) called price increases ""inevitable."" They are estimating a **\~7% increase for meat and fish**, with pressure on other products like coffee, cocoa, fruits, and vegetables.
* **Tolls (Portagens):** If you drive, expect toll prices on motorways to increase by approximately **2.29%**. The bridges in Lisbon (25 de Abril and Vasco da Gama) might see a slightly higher increase of around 2.38%.

(remembering that the tolls were scrapped in Southern Portugal in 2025. Several roads there are now toll free, and A2 is expected to have considerable cuts)

* **Electricity:**
   * For those on the **regulated market**, bills will increase by an average of **1%**.
   * For everyone (including the **free market**), the ""network access tariffs"" component of your bill will rise by **3.5%**. This means even if your provider doesn't change its energy price, your total bill will likely still go up. The exact amount will depend on your specific plan.

**What's NOT getting more expensive (some good news!)**

* **Public Transport Passes:**
   * **Lisbon:** The price of the monthly **Navegante** pass will remain frozen at €40 (Metropolitan) and €30 (Municipal) for the seventh year in a row.
   * **Porto:** The price of monthly **Andante** passes will also be frozen. However, be aware that single-trip and on-board tickets will see a small price increase.
* **University Tuition (Propinas):** For anyone studying or with kids in university, the maximum tuition fee for public universities (accessed as NATIONAL student) will remain frozen at **€697** for the 2026/2027 academic year.

**TL;DR:** The minimum wage is going up to €920, which also raises the financial bar for visa applications. Expect to pay more for rent (potentially), groceries, electricity, and tolls. However, the price of monthly public transport passes in Lisbon and Porto is staying the same, and university tuition is frozen for another year.

Hope this helps everyone budget and plan for the year ahead",1,1766130267.0,AnchorLessEurope,0,1.0,False
1pqfbu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pqfbu3/sp_habituation/,[SP] Habituation,"Raindrops fell from the dark and misty night, each one ending with a splash. The wind bought with it a cold sense of despair through the cracks of his garage door, even when fully closed. Cuberoy fluttered his eyes open, and slowly rolled out of his bed, and slipped into his ragged clothes filled with numerous holes that exposed his black leather fabric suit inside. This suit, made of high tech kevlar, and was as black and cold as the sky above him itself. A little display opened up in his iris, reporting him the weather and his calendar and he stepped outside his humble room into the dark alleyway of the city above. He climbed each step up on the polished grey stone, looking almost like obsidian under the darkness of the night sky.

This was like every other day in Centripede, the capital of a large island nation named Ace in the middle of the lost ocean. It was vast, spanning neon blue and pink in every which direction, the rain never stopped, only subsided by the cities large sewage systems that ran continuously spewing the water out back into the oceans beyond the humongous walls that were cut from stone and shaped like mountains, The Great Reel was the name of this majestic wall that surrounded the island nation and protected it from the great typhoons raging outside. No one knows what's beyond those walls, but some believe that there were vast continents as wide as a star hidden away.

As far a Cube knew, there might not have been anything, as it didn’t really matter to him anyway. Stepping away from the Slotherlands, he entered the Sunder, which lay just above his homeland. The narrow corridor opened up into a wide busy street filled with couples carrying fancy flying umbrellas, neon signs in every direction he looked, and the smell of sweet roast chicken. He cradled a cup of granger, his favorite sports drink, as he walked past the fortunate folk of the capital. Back in the Slotherlands, which lay just beyond the city limits deep under the sewage, things were not much the same. Floods devastated their homes, ravaged their food, and the law? Forget about it. Cuberoy had been one of the lucky few to land a well paying job from a girl he met in a coffee shop once. Her short and perky nature was in stark contrast with his gritty doom and gloom, but yet she gave him a chance. A chance that was so rare, and so precious, that he could never repay her.

Clare was always there for him, even though he could never understand how someone could be so up going and cheerful in stark contrast to the cruel demeanor of the Silica factory. It produced weapons of war and was literally labeled a “get yourself killed zone” but alas he had no other choice. A job was better than no job, especially when it made all the difference between starving and not dying for another day. He was only able to afford the most basic of kevlar suits, which he called Soint. Soint was nothing special, just another run of the mill super suit, the cheapest kind, that gave mundane humans the ability to actually be useful. Everyone here in the vibrant neon streets of the Sunder had something similar, only much, much, much more expensive.

As he continued day dreaming, he felt a hand on his shoulder. No sooner he turned to look, he was on the ground. “Stay out of our way, brat.” Cube wanted to fight back, but no matter how hard he tried he couldn't stand up, his face scraped against the grey cement. HIs new suit was damaged beyond repair, and his hair was soaking wet in the muddy puddle as they kicked him and laughed and went about their business. Cube slowly tried crawling back towards an alley, where he assessed the damage as raindrops fell on his bare skin, the acid from the pollution burning his raw skin in painful blisters. He took off his brown leather strap back off of his back and took out some expensive plug tape to patch up his holes. “Those fools don’t understand the suffering of the Slothlands, I bet they couldn’t even survive a day there without their suits.” But that's all the difference they needed between him and them. They were rich, he was not, his worries didn’t matter in their eyes, to them he was nothing but a filthy slum rat.

Cube slowly stood up, taking off his helmet and switching to his shield and a gas mask. The toxic blue rain drops plopped against his silver guardian, a gift from his grandmother, Emily. Feeling hungry and exhausted that he had to walk while others glided over the obsidian magnets attached to the ground and to their shoes. He took a shortcut and found his favorite Yorin shop in a hole in the wall. The food wasn’t bad, it wasn’t good, but it felt like home. And best of all it was affordable. The old cyborg with green eyes and pink hair smiled warmly at him and placed down a plate of his usual order, scanning Cube’s red iris. A bowl of mushed sausage noodles with crab handles shaped like chopsticks appeared in front of him, as he slurped down the delicious Yorin. “It’s not bad to splurge from time to time, right?”

As he paid for his meal and pushed his red plush stool back below the table, a subtle shift occurred. He blinked and turned to look behind him, but the blank grey wall covered by shadows stared right back into his soul. The next moment the owner of the Yorin shop was nowhere in sight, his eyes tensed, his breath quicked, and before he knew it something sharp pierced his abdomen. Before he could react, blood poured out of his stomach and he slowly fainted. In his last moments, his vision turned blood red as the poisonous rain fell upon his ragged skin.

Waking up Cube was no more, he was in an unfamiliar lair, empty orange walls surrounded him. He yelled into the darkness, but there was no response. He could hear strange muffled sounds, but the more he concentrated the farther they got. Picking a random direction he began to walk. The dim yellow lights were the same everywhere, and he saw a watch laying on the ground from time to time. He continued west, hoping to find something, anything in this desolate waste land.

Cube noticed that his broken suit was missing too. He was just left wearing his tattered rags and his small pouch of water. As he walked along, he noticed a subtle shift in one of the walls, there were soft footsteps. Deciding not to attract unwanted attention, he slowly followed it until he found none other than Clare, who looked more disheveled than him. Noticing him she turned around and gestured for him to come closer, and together they whispered with the hum of a refrigerator in the background.

“Where are we?” She asked, confused, and his reply of lacking knowledge left her with more dismay. “I was drinking my coffee, and then I was stabbed while making my way to the bathroom, and I woke up here.” A single drop of liquid rippled an echo in the distance, instantly making them quiet. They used their eyes to gesture to follow the sound, and soon arrived at the pool of magenta liquid.

In stark contrast with the orange shores, the pool of magenta seemed alluring. Claire tried putting a foot in to gauge the depth of the pool, but before she could react something pulled her in, and she desperately dragged Cube along with her into the water. The last thing he saw was getting suffocated by the water before his eyes dimmed and gave out.

Waking up once again, now back in Centripede, he looked around stunned at what just happened, and then hurriedly rushed back out into the safety of the streets. But as soon as he arrived he noticed a jarring silence. The alleyway led towards a giant room, its walls made of white boards. Claire was standing there holding a red marker pen. Approaching her, he asked what happened before, and she replied, making his head sway, about being here all along, having no memory of the orange labyrinth.

She drew a circle with a key, and then it shimmered and she stepped into it? Cube was stunned as she left the realms of his reality, leaving him trapped behind. He did not understand, none of it made sense. He tried to follow her but the walls made of whiteboards refused to let him pass, no matter how hard he tried. He had to think of a way to escape but how?

Sitting in the center of the room feeling lost and hopeless, he stared at the floor, which was also made of whiteboard. He noticed a piece of his hair that had fallen upon this pristine white surface, which suddenly sparked a sense of genius within him. He slowly moved his finger, rubbing it along the glistening white prison, and motioned to make a circle with a key in its center. The friction between the surface and his skin left small specs of shredded dead cells along the white walls, resulting in a faint but barely noticeably portal. It glowed with brilliant red light as he tried to step through.

Immediately he felt disoriented as the ground beneath him had abandoned his weight. He was falling, falling fast, towards the empty city again. But this time he landed on a soft hut located on the great reed, the tall jagged walls reaching into the sky to meet his fall. There he rolled over after blasting a hole through the roof, where he saw Claire once more, brewing a cup of tea.

Wait, wasn’t she a coffee drinker? This didn’t make any sense, as she spun around and waved at him. He awkwardly waved back, while subtly noticing the shift from her pink shoes to red shoes. “What are you doing up on the great reel? Why are you peering away from Centripede, don’t you know that we're not supposed to see the rest of Ace?” She glanced back through the window she was looking out of before and smiled as she stepped closer to him. “What do you mean, I’ve always been here.”

Not wanting to provoke her, he stepped aside and walked to the tea pot, which was still boiling with tea. Claire appeared next to him as she calmly grabbed the pot and poured it on her hand. Stunned Cuberoy stared at her in horror as her skin melted away revealing a two prong charger, which she promptly plugged into the ground. The next moment a faint light enveloped the hut and the great reel shuddered, as a blinding explosion of pure orange electricity engulfed the hut. The last thing he saw was Claire's smile, happy and unbothered as ever before it all went dark.

This time he did not wake up. Cuberoy couldn’t see, but he could tell by the smothering hot Yorin that he was back in the alleyway. As he awkwardly handed an unknown amount of money to the shopkeeper, who yelped with surprise at the large sum, he stumbled out back onto the street. His suit was severely damaged like before, but it was back nonetheless. He continued walking as the rain beaded off his skin, leaving temporary burn marks in their place.

He stumbled forward and slipped into the hands of an elegant young woman, It was Claire! But this time she seemed more confused than ever. “Hey Cubey, you okay?” He nodded weakly and she gently caressed his face, bringing back his sight of Centripede once more. He looked around stunned, trying to make sense of what just happened to him as she guided him to a nearby bench to sit down.

After she made sure he was okay, she left back for the groceries she had come here to buy in the first place, leaving Cube alone with his thoughts. He wondered what just happened as his friends Claude and Langer spotted him sitting meekly on the rusty meat bench.

“Hey Cube, long time no see!” Claude said, his face brimming with excitement. Just as he approached him, the magenta pool appeared once more, sending the two of them sliding back into the orange labyrinth, as Langer desperately tried to grab onto them. They fell and fell and fell, and eventually ended up on a large hill made of plastic rubbish. In the next moment, Claude is sucked into the hill, as Cuby tries to save him. Instead Clare grabs him from behind and stops him from helping his friend.

“He’s gone, leave him be” He turned around stunned as Claire drew another circle in the air, leading him back to Centripiede, the desolate one. “You have to listen, before I’m gone, don’t give in, if you do, we all die, and the great real becomes our grave.” With that she exploded into a bouquet of flowers as he was once again left in the alleyway of the Yorin shop. Confused, he stumbles back into the now empty streets and notices the colossal whiteboard room from the outside.

Once again, drawing a circle on the walls leads him to fall down, this time back into the orange labyrinth. This time he was truly alone. No matter how far he walked he couldn’t find an end. Mentally drained he decides to take a short break, but before he could even sit down, the acid rain leaks back through the walls, slowly filling up, burning him alive.

He had read many webtoons before, where the main character was granted some supernatural talent to survive such harrowing odds, but he was no superhuman, just another factory worker, and he died as another mundane factory worker. His eyes burned in the green liquid as he slowly gave in to the desire of peace, as the lights faded and darkened around him.

Waking back up at the Yorin shop from the strange dream, he thought not much of it as he walked back to work as if nothing had happened. He went back home and went to sleep. Day after day, night after night. Every new day something attracted him back to the dark alleyway of the Yorin shop, he did not know why. He kept coming back for more noodles day after day, they were infamous in Centripede after all, but he couldn’t quite remember where he had got that information from.

Claire helplessly watched Cube walk back to the shop, trapped behind the one way wall of the alley as she banged repeatedly at its walls, begging him to stop, but to no avail. It was her clone that had shown him this shop in the first place on that rainy day from long ago after all. With each trip to the shop, a small portion of Cube's soul was devoured by the shop opener, whose true form was not known. It slowly replaced him piece by piece, turning him into a clone as well, slowly trapping his spirituality behind the wall, just like what happened to Claire, Claude, and Langer.

Claire was only the first of many victims still to come, and no matter her partial warnings in Cube’s nightmares he continued to come to the Yorin shop every day, slowly carving away a chunk of his mind to the owner, replacing his body with a mindless clone piece by piece. By the time he realized what was going on it was too late. Claire watched in horror as her friend was slowly devoured by the shadow, and soon their friends rose from the shadows to join him, and nonchalantly walked out back into the real Centripeide, pretending to be mundane humans, guiding more of them back to the alleyway with the Yorin shop.

The owner of the shop climbed back up to the top of his apartment of the left building alleyway, grinning with sharp fangs for teeth as he saw, how he and his malignant brothers trapped the humans in such a city surrounding them with the great reel, severing their connections with the rest of Earth, in a small island in the middle of the Pacific, with no one to save them from solely being tortured and devoured by these treacherous monsters.

They had trapped many humans on islands like this before, and feasted on their souls, slowly trapping them and turning them into their clones to being released back into Earth, slowly blending in with the others, to capture even more humans to trap and devour and feast on more souls. This whole city was no more than a mirage, a place for lowly humans like Cube to suffer endlessly and become their vessels for all of eternity.

Helpless and oblivious to his suffering, Cube woke up ready to face a day like any other, suspecting nothing was wrong, as he walked back to his favorite Yorin shop that Claire had told him about a long time ago. Her helpless cries fell on deaf ears and feasted on more noodles and fell back asleep, back into his arduous and never ending nightmares. Then the shop owner grinned once more.

1pqf7zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1pqf7zs/how_i_finally_cracked_the_code_on_writing_6_blogs/,How I (finally) cracked the code on writing 6 blogs in 2 hours every Sunday,"Okay, so full disclosure - I used to HATE content creation. Like, really hate it. As a SaaS founder, you know you *should* be blogging consistently, but finding the time? Nearly impossible.

I tried everything. Writing one blog per week and taking 4 hours (total nightmare). Batch writing on weekends (still took forever). Even hired freelancers (expensive and never quite got our voice right).

Then I stumbled onto a system that actually works.

Here's my Sunday ritual now:

# The Setup (30 minutes - sometimes 45 if I'm distracted)

First, I pull up our analytics dashboard. What are people actually searching for? What questions keep coming up in support tickets? That's my goldmine.

I pick 6 topics. Sometimes I overshoot and pick 7, then drop the weakest one. It's fine - perfection is the enemy here.

Quick outlines - literally bullet points. Nothing fancy. Like:

* Problem we're solving
* How we think about it
* 3 practical tips
* One surprising insight
* Call to action

# The Writing Sprint (90 minutes of pure chaos)

This is where it gets interesting. I set a timer for 15 minutes per blog. No, seriously - 15 minutes.

First few times? Disaster. I'd get halfway through and panic. ""This is terrible! I need more time!""

But here's the thing - when you know you only have 15 minutes, you cut the BS. You get straight to the point. Turns out, readers actually prefer that.

My process looks like this:

1. Research dump (2 minutes)
2. Rough draft (10 minutes)
3. Quick polish (3 minutes)
4. Move to next one without overthinking

# The Mistakes I Made (so you don't have to)

* **Perfectionism**: Used to spend 2 hours on one blog trying to make it ""perfect."" Guess what? Perfect doesn't exist and my readers didn't care anyway.
* **Over-researching**: Would fall down rabbit holes reading 10 articles before writing. Now I give myself 5 minutes max for research per topic.
* **Editing while writing**: Big mistake. Write first, edit later. Even if it feels messy, just get it down.
* **Skipping the timer**: Some days I'd think ""I don't need a timer, I'll just write naturally."" Wrong. The timer creates urgency that forces clarity.

# What Makes This Actually Work

The game-changer for me was having everything in one place. I can research a topic, write about it, then jump to the next one without losing my train of thought.

When I'm writing about technical stuff, I switch to a more analytical tone. For beginner guides? More conversational. The key is being able to adapt quickly without starting over each time.

# Real Results

* Consistency: Actually publishing 6 blogs every single week now
* Time: 2 hours vs the 8-10 hours I used to spend
* Quality: Honestly? Better. More focused, less fluff
* Traffic: Starting to go up, because Google loves consistent content

# My Sunday Workflow (copy this)

1. **Coffee first** (non-negotiable)
2. **30 minutes**: Topic research + outlines
3. **90 minutes**: Writing sprint with 15-minute timer per blog
4. **30 minutes**: Quick edits, schedule everything
5. **Rest of Sunday**: Actually enjoy my weekend

# The Bottom Line

Look, if you're a founder struggling with content, you're not alone. I spent months trying to ""figure out"" the perfect system before realizing that done is better than perfect.

This 2-hour Sunday system lets me compete with companies that have full-time content teams. And honestly? The content is probably better because it's more focused and practical.

Your mileage may vary, but give it a shot. Start with 3 blogs in 2 hours, work up to 6. The timer is your friend, not your enemy.

And hey, if you mess up the first few times (I definitely did), that's part of the process. Keep at it - the consistency payoff is huge.

Now go enjoy your Sunday afternoon. You've earned it.",2,1766129843.0,automation,1,1.0,False

About Me (the fun + real parts)

• 4’11” on paper, magically 5’2” outside. Heels are a lifestyle, not a choice.

• NBSB (Never Been in a Relationship)— and yes, I’m proud of it. I believe in intentional beginnings.

• Soft, slightly chubby cutie— meds added a little weight, but confidence stayed. If you only like super slim girls, we might not be a match (photos are on my profile for reference).

• Night-shift, WFH girly— U.S. hours, Philippines-based. I still reply in the mornings because apparently my brain refuses to sleep long.

• Financially independent — I can pay for myself, always. I just don’t want to date someone who expects me to pay for ✨everything✨. I’m young, not a sugar mommy. 😭

• Cafe hopper & foodie at heart — whether solo or with friends, I love discovering new coffee spots and restaurants.

• Nature lover & travel enthusiast— road trips, views, quiet moments, and creating memories (especially with family).

• Not a gamer — tried once, got called a noob, retired peacefully. 😂

• High-energy person— I bring enthusiasm, curiosity, and a lot of personality. If that overwhelms you, I get it… but consider this your disclaimer.

• Fast replier & certified yapper— I enjoy conversations. If you hate excited messages or long chats, you may want to keep scrolling.

• Road-trip lover— usually with my dad (yes, daddy’s girl energy). I don’t drive yet, so bonus points if you do. 😅

• Has a curfew — strict parents. But once trust is built, that curfew mysteriously disappears. 😌

---
🌱 Green Flags I Appreciate 🌱

✔ Loves coffee and café hopping

✔ Big foodie — open to trying new cuisines

✔ Nature lover & travel enthusiast

✔ Enjoys road trips

✔ Respects boundaries and pacing

---
❌ My “Red Flags” (just being honest 🚩)

• Vertigo / motion sickness

• Afraid of swimming in the beach

• Parent-imposed curfew (late-night spontaneity can be tricky)

• Prefer structured or safe adventures over extreme activities (no skydiving or deep-sea diving 😅)

• Prefer getting to know someone through chat first before meeting in person

---
 Someone Who Might Be My Type (hopefully you exist 🥺)

• 25–29 years old — I naturally prefer someone a bit older

• Taller than me (around 5’9” and up) — I’m already small, let’s give future kids a fighting chance 😂

• Has a stable job or income — I’ve experienced dating someone unemployed who expected me to pay on the first date. Never again. I’m okay with 50/50; I just want balance.

• Consistent & considerate — if you lose interest, please communicate. No ghosting.

• Can make time — effort matters more than words

• Good listener and a talker — conversations should go both ways. Nakakapagod if one person does all the emotional lifting 😂

• Comfortable chatting first — I like building rapport online so meeting feels natural, not awkward

---

If you made it this far, thank you 🫶
If you decide to message me, ✨please introduce yourself properly✨—I usually don’t reply to messages with no effort or no context.

1pqf7ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pqf7ap/dysfunction_junction_family/,Dysfunction Junction Family,"Hi! I F19 currently am living at home while saving up money to move out (working while in school, commuting to campus to save money) I live with both parents, 3 brothers (23, 21, 17), and 2 dogs. As you can probably tell from the background I have given, there has been ongoing issues in my household specifically with my 23 year old brother. He’s dropped out of college, been fired from almost every job he’s worked, and has had no regard for anyone’s belongings including his own. Some examples 1. I like having sugar free vanilla syrup to make vanilla cokes or use in my ninja creami when I’m dieting. I have to write my name on the bottle at least 10 times (obviously this isn’t the first occurrence) to try to and prevent my brother from using it. I didn’t use it for maybe 2 weeks and discovered my brother used 2/3 of the bottle even with my name written on the side. “I didn’t think you needed it” and “it’s probably not that expensive” were the excuses I was given. 2. He leaves dirty pots and pans out EVERY DAY. My parents ask him every time to clean up after himself and he ignores them, which causes my parents to be pissed at him 95% of the time. 3. He leaves wet towels behind my brother’s bathroom door and stacks them until the door won’t open all the way. Why he needs a new towel this often? Don’t know. So we’ve had to add a handle with a lock to the towel closet in our house. 4. my younger brother needed to get a handle with a lock for his closet door because my oldest brother has begun stealing his clothes from his closet. Now he has started taking them directly from the washer/dryer. Again, he has plenty of his own clothes. 5. He racked up $750+ on my mom’s credit card. My mom has given each of us an emergency credit card in case we are ever stuck somewhere or in a situation where we might need it, but it’s for emergency or authorized use only. My brother ran up that massive bill on massages for him and his gf, eating out, etc. My mom took the money out of every paycheck he had until she was paid back, but it was still hell to live through the constant fighting. 5. I like to dabble in a lot of creative things (music, drawing, painting, crochet, sewing, etc.) a few months ago he spilled coffee all over my sewing machine and only told me because I walked downstairs in the middle of the sorry excuse of a cleanup. Well, this is what pushed me over the edge tonight and led me to Reddit. I decided to clean and organize my sewing table. When I went to the basement counter to retrieve my new sewing patterns(I hadn’t had the chance to put them away) I discovered they were covered in coffee stains, wrinkled, and almost certainly ruined. This had to have happened a few weeks ago, again, I was not told a damn thing. It’s almost like he intentionally chose the one spot on the counter where my patterns were. 6. He’s thrown out almost all of our Tupperware and silverware because he’s too lazy to clean it. The silverware set my parents have had for over 20 years (it was a wedding present) slowly started disappearing over the last few weeks. My mom caught my brother throwing them out because he didn’t want to clean them. She bought a new set but refuses to get them out until my brother moves out (I better get used to not having forks or spoons) I cannot take it anymore. This is the list I came up with while trying to keep my frustration brief. My younger brother and I went to my parents again and asked them to get him to leave the house. They’ve told him in the past they would kick him out at the end of the month but they always go back on their word.  My dad is convinced he will “die on the street” if they kick him out now (he has no money saved because he gets chipotle/eats out twice a day multiple times a week) My parents told us “well there’s nothing we can do” so I guess I’m out of luck in that department. Upon seeing my new sewing patterns in a coffee-soaked state, I decided that my only option is to take revenge my own way. So I’ve started by taking all of his stupid bags of flavored coffee and hiding them. When he buys me new sewing patterns he can have them back. So I am asking, begging, and pleading… What can I do to try and bring discipline back to this household? Is there anything I can say to my parents to try and convince them to end this madness??? Again I’m saving up to move out but I still have to go multiple months before I’m ready.

I'm a recent graduate from UCR and I've been seeing a lot of posts on this subreddit specifically about the chem8 series(Ochem). I've taken the courses too and was fortunate enough to have faculty from the chemistry department who were patient yet stern enough to encourage me to develop my skills and to love the subject, and I'd like to pass it on. I truly love this field and it's a sad to see that the classes have such a poor reputation in undergraduate studies. 

These days as I'm doing a graduate program in bioengineering, however, I've been seeing an lack of knowledge when it comes to organic chemistry even in the graduate level, so I'd like to do my part in leveling the balance a bit. 

If you have trouble with the content and/or want to go into fields that require a strong understanding of ochem(med, pharm, bioengineering, etc) I'd like to extend an open invitation to join me going forwards. I'll explain the content in the way I learned these concepts 2-3 years ago as simply as possible. How this'll be framed is a general review of concepts + practice problems and scenarios from recent literature. (I'm willing to also angle this more towards prep for specific specialties as well, but that will be decided upon later). 

I don't know when the classes are going to be time-wise for the winter quarter but I'll plan some meetings to go over the content with y'all periodically(like every 1.5-2weeks or so). 

If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, join the discord link below. The link is set to last indefinitely(unless I fucked up somewhere) so feel free to come and go as you please.

Our encounter was magical and calming. I never expected I would meet a soul so unique yet aligned with mine. 

Then our story began…

That day, we shared our interests, hobbies, work-life and what not. Some similarities, some differences, but most importantly, I felt something special was brewing, like the coffee that I ordered and was not available at the coffee shop that day. The irony of it was interesting. It seems the universe was already telling something but I chose to ignore. 

All I expected that day was to meet a stranger and get myself distracted from my busy and troubled life. However, there was something in you that made me want to know you more.

We are both complicated in the most unique ways but still we gave it a chance and those times I’ve spent with you are the most precious moments and most memorable experience I’ve had in my entire existence. I’m very grateful for that and for your trust in sharing all your secrets with me. 

I will admit it. I fell for you.

You thought me how the stars in the universe work in the most beautiful way. You made me feel I belonged as you shared your anime fondness like mine. You thought me how your world is different from mine and it opened my eyes that such unique soul exists and I loved every bit of it. 

I feared the time that all the happy moments would end, as what you’ve been saying in the first place. But then suddenly, it came. You said you couldn’t stay and sacrifice your own happiness for this relationship. I felt helpless or maybe I’m just a coward who can’t even fight for my feelings. 

You said you felt unseen and it’s time for you to care for yourself. I’m sorry and I respect that. 

Yesterday, you deleted all our conversations and blocked me on your socials. I felt devastated as those are the only memories I had with you. Those are the only things I cling on to when I want to see your face and reminisce the best time with you. It’s as if you’re telling me that none of it mattered. It’s painful. 

I want to reach out but a part of me is saying that it will just prolong our misery. 

I miss you so bad and I don’t know if i’ll get over this one. I still hope that one day our paths will cross again and everything will fall perfectly into place. 

I wish you well and greatness in life! I am always rooting for you.

I’m in the process of reducing caffeine and slowly trying to quit coffee completely. I’m still somewhat addicted, and this is an ongoing process for me, not something I’ve “won” already. That’s partly why I wanted to ask this here.

Lately I’ve been noticing how *intense* coffee culture feels, especially in big cities. Coffee shops on every corner, endless apps, loyalty programs, rising prices, influencers constantly promoting new “must-have” coffee machines for home, reels romanticizing caffeine dependency as a personality trait. It feels unavoidable.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking:  
Is this normal enjoyment… or is it mass normalization of addiction?

Like when you’re trying to cut down or quit, the constant visual and social pressure feels exhausting. Like you’re swimming upstream while the whole city is caffeinated and proud of it.

A few questions I’m genuinely curious about:

* Did you start noticing coffee culture *more* once you reduced or quit?
* Does it bother you, or do you feel neutral about it now?
* How much coffee did you used to drink vs now?
* Do you feel social pressure to participate (meeting friends, work culture, “grab a coffee”)?
* How do you personally cope with it being everywhere?

I’m interested in how people here relate to the *environment* around caffeine, especially while trying to step away from it.

Hi! I (F, US) would really like to get my partner (M, currently in Egypt) a gift for the holidays and then for his birthday coming up. He was able to easily surprise me with a beautiful wool scarf (it is cold where I am at). It is convenient to ship from places like Amazon to the US. But for me to get him a gift, it would be way more in shipping and import charges than the cost of the gift itself. It would be more practical to travel there with gifts than it would be to ship one from my location. I can’t make the travel until spring 😢

So… Anyone here have experience in Egypt? Where can I order from that has local shipping in Egypt? Any recommendations on local places? Where can pay I with US currency or something global like PayPal (and not have to expect the exorbitant customs fees)?

Some things he likes:
Coffee and Tea, Brownies and simple desserts, Sentimental and romantic things, Cute comfy sweaters, Nike clothing and shoes, Cigarettes/cigars (probably not a good gift coming from me lol), Gaming, tv shows, anime, tech, Simple silver jewelry, Being silly on video calls with me 💕

electronics and jewelry are probably a no go because of customs unless I can find a local store?

I have been thinking and thinking and don’t have a clue what to do. He always says he just wants me. He never speaks of desire for anything besides me. Obviously, the best gift would to be able to visit but we are both working very hard right now. 🫠 I want to get him something sentimental and meaningful to express my gratitude for him entering my life and changing it for the better the last several months.

(We are both Chinese working in Vietnam)

A Vietnamese traffic police stopped us on motorcycles.

Heard this before: Some police may want to extort. But let's see what's going on.

Police said we did not turn on the headlights, and also asked to check my driver's license. Oh shit bro, the headlight issue was my fault, a simple mistake.

When they checked the license, i showed an online record. But police said this was not accepted, only the app VNeID is valid. But the web record should also work?

Police said we had to move the car to another place, and might hold the car. Oh my god, is it going to be a serious problem?

We stayed there and called coworkers for advice, police pushed us many times, but we still don't move. Coworkeds told us that, the documents were fine, it is only the headlight issue, paying 1 million VND as ""coffee money"" was enough, also remember to hide the wallet, never show how much cash we really have, and claim that we only have that much money.

After about 40 minutes, we were still at the same place. The first officer looked impatient, made a phone call, then another officer arrived later. That officer got into our car, and try to drive it away.(He is going to hold our car?)

We quitely took out 6 million VND in cash, this was all the money we had. The second officer's eyes lit up, counted the cash on the motorcycle, then showed a hand sign for five?

Seemed to want 5 million more?

The first officer shook his head, waved us away. Finally we drove home and the matter ended.

# Conflict Point 1

The first issue is simple, what makes a foreign driver's license ""valid""? Were the police cheating us? Is the web record really invalid?

I checked the document, seems that the app is not a strict legal rule. But i still backed down on last night because i am not 100% sure.(Please correct me if i wrong).

[Showing the web record is enough...?](https://preview.redd.it/4wty33c7348g1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6414fdb2ce6b1a62f359dcbcd25c3cfc1c11c427)

# Conflict Point 2

How much is acceptable?

For no headlights, the 800,000VND-1 million should be enough for fine. I accpect fine for not turning on the headlight.

But in the end, they took 6 million VND for ""license issues"" reason. I think i lost this round, 6 million VND is not a small amount.

# My Girlfriend

Being pulled over by police is obviously, stressful. And it is even worse when you do not speak the language.

How did my girlfriend do?

She did very well!

She contacted her Vietnamese coworker for advice, and helped me a lot last night. Also warned me that never get into the car because there is a real case, police drove her friend to a wooder area, then searched the wallet and ask for a large sum.

I am very grateful to my girlfriend, in the most awkward and tense moment, she stayed calm and steady the whold time.

# After Review

In today's morning, i told my Chinese coworkers. They have worked in Vietnam for over 10 years, and very experienced. They all said that i was too weak. 6 million VND was far too high, still have room to bargain, i should not give in just because they looked fierce.

Traffic police power in Vietnam is very large, but if they want to tow a car, they must file reports and no ""coffee money"". If i have been firmer and threatened to report them, then the fine might just be 1 million VND. (I am not sure, if only the headlight issue, 1 million VND is ok; but if there is a driving license issue, the fine will be bigger)

They also suggested: say you are just an employee, the car belongs to the company. Claim the company knows senior officials, ask to record the officers's badge number.

Ok, i took all advice, will be calm when dealing with police next time.

# My thoughts

I got three thoughts, from big to small.

First, there is corruption is Vietnam. Vietnam has strengths, there are no gangs or mafias. But it is also not always clean. If i work long-term in Vietnam, i must accept this reality.

Second, how hould i deal with traffic police?

Do not be too hard, or the issue will grow.

Do not be too soft, or might be extorted.

The 6 million VND was tuition fee.

Third, on a personal level, i must stay calm.

No one could guarantee a life without extortion. Calmness must be trained in daily life, then we could handle emergencies. Last night, i did not do well, need to improve.

# Am i criticize  Vietnam?

You might say this:

I did not turn on the headlights, the license was incomplete, broke the rules, a fine was fair. Why am i trying to criticize the police?

I admit my fault, 1 millon VND fine is acceptable. But using vague ""license issues"" to take 6 million VND is not, the rules are unclear.

The dentist assistant said I could use a straw after 24 hours. Today I bought a coffee and sucked on the straw to get the caramel. It was quick. Didn’t do it too much. A few hours ago, I started getting this weird feeling. The extraction site doesn’t hurt, but it feels “exposed.” I compare the feeling to when I bite myself accidentally and get an abscess. It feels like if I am getting a sore or something like that on the molar location (on the side of the gums). I’m not sure if it’s from playing or a normal feeling. I had my wisdom teeth pull out over 13 years ago and can’t remember following many “rules.” I took a peek and see white with dark spots. On the side of the molar place it looks white. It wasn’t painful when they removed it. Just pressure. Dentist had difficulty removing it because it was really “stuck” and he had to use a few different things to loosen the molar. My question is - is the feeling of “feeling like an abscess is forming, but there is nothing there” normal? Or is it the beginning of a dry socket. No pain as of now.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where the line between a feast and a snack is as clear as a Marriott Center spotlight. On December 19, 2025, the Abilene Christian Wildcats (visitors) will trudge into Provo to face the BYU Cougars, who are favored by a *staggering* 33 points across most books. Let’s unpack this lopsided spread with the precision of a stat geek and the humor of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Spread Feels Like a Math Test

The numbers scream “BYU dominance.” DraftKings and BetMGM have the Cougars as 33.5-point favorites, while others peg them at 33. Translating that into implied probability (using decimal odds from the spread lines): For BYU’s -33.5 bets at \~1.95 odds, the implied win probability is roughly **51.28%**. Not earth-shattering, but combined with historical context? Let’s just say Abilene’s chances of pulling off an upset are about as likely as me understanding crypto.

The total line hovers around **145.5-146.5**, suggesting bookmakers expect a high-scoring game. But given BYU’s home-court advantage (they’re 12-2 there this season) and Abilene’s… well, let’s call it “modest” offensive output (18th in scoring defense, per 2023 metrics), this could be a Cougars blowout with enough points to fill a spreadsheet.

I got a great question from Jason that exposes something most men never stop to think about: *How do you genuinely ask someone on a date the moment you meet them—without being creepy, needy, or running some pickup strategy?*

It’s a surprisingly deep question, because the real issue isn’t how to ask. It’s **why** you’re asking, and what mindset you’re carrying into the moment.

See, most guys approach instant dates like a mission they’re supposed to accomplish. They rehearse lines, pre-plan strategies, and decide in advance, “If I meet a woman today, I’m going to take her out on the spot.” The problem is, by the time they ask her out, it’s not genuine anymore. She’s not a person—they’re using her to complete a task.

And people can feel that.

# The Real Reason Asking People Out Feels Awkward

If you’re trying to “get” something from someone—validation, sex, a win, a confidence boost—it instantly creates pressure. Pressure for you to perform, and pressure for her to react the “right” way.

But if your intention is simply to express how you feel and invite someone into your world because you *actually* want them there, everything changes.

That’s the core idea in this video:  
**Take the question mark out of asking someone out.**

Most guys ask in the form of a request—“Would you like to go out with me?”—which immediately puts the woman in the position of deciding whether or not to grant you something.

A confident, honest man doesn’t ask for permission.  
He *expresses how he feels* and *invites people to join him.*

# How Authentic Attraction Actually Sounds

Instead of performing, impressing, or negotiating, you simply say something like:

“I’m really enjoying talking to you. I’d love to spend a bit more time together—I’m grabbing a coffee right now if you want to join me.”

No questions. No begging. No pressure.  
Just a clean expression of interest.

And the beauty of this approach is that you can feel immediately whether you’re being genuine. You can’t fake honesty. If you don’t truly want her there, you’ll feel it as you speak.

# What If You’re In a Rush?

Then you use the most powerful move in authentic dating:

Give your number and walk away.

Not “Can I have your number?”  
Not “We should hang out sometime.”

Simply:

“I’d like to see you again. Here’s my number. If you feel the same, reach out.”

Now the power is entirely in her hands.  
No pressure. No chasing.  
And you get an instant filter for whether she’s actually interested.

# Why This Matters

Most dating problems men experience—neediness, awkwardness, fear, overthinking—come from trying to *take* something from someone instead of simply *sharing* yourself.

When you stop strategizing and start expressing, attraction becomes effortless.

I was running an old WhisperX setup, but it was starting to show its age (abandoned repo, old PyTorch, memory leaks). I decided to rebuild it from scratch using **Faster-Whisper** (CTranslate2) and the new **Pyannote 4.0.3** for diarization.

It sounded simple. It was not.

**The Nightmare:**

* **PyTorch 2.8 + cuDNN 9:** Pip installs cuDNN 9 inside `site-packages`, but the Linux system linker has no clue where it is. Result? Constant Segfaults and `Exit Code 52`.
* **API Breaking Changes:** Pyannote 4.0 changed how it returns annotations (containers instead of objects), which broke my entire alignment logic.
* **Dependency Conflicts:** Trying to make `lightning` (new) coexist with libraries expecting `pytorch-lightning` (old) inside one Docker container is painful.

The Solution (The ""Nuclear Option""):

I ended up manually building the environment layer by layer in Docker.

1. **Forced Paths:** I had to explicitly set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point deep into the python packages so the system could find the NVIDIA libs.
2. **Algorithm Rewrite:** I rewrote the speaker-to-word alignment algorithm. It used to be quadratic O(N\*M), which choked on long audio. I optimized it to a linear scan O(N).

The Result:

The service now processes audio fully (transcription + diarization + alignment) in \~30 seconds for test files that used to take much longer.

Hardware: RTX 4000 Ada.

VRAM usage: \~4GB (huge headroom left).

Attached is the screenshot of the final successful build after 50+ failed attempts. Seeing those green checkmarks felt better than coffee.

1pqes8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pqes8g/aita_for_bring_friendship_into_business/,AITA for bring friendship into business,"AITA for getting mad at my best friend/ business partner.

So early this summer me and my best friend (we will call her Emily) started a small business making handmade items that take a lot of work. 

Overall we have had a lot of fun but we do butt heads on somethings, some of the thing I have gotten upset about I feel like she puts the business on the back burner a lot until the last minute no matters how much I beg her for us to work on things and especially never prioritizes the events for smelling the items and her thinking it’s ok for us to just show up whenever and it will often be hours after the even started. she will get upset at me if I stop taking as much initiative but this frustrates me because at the same time i feel like she won’t let me and just bosses me around. 

For context we work out of her house because she has a very large house and I live out of one room so i often don’t have much choice in these matters if she fights me on it. 

Now a few weeks ago it was small business Saturday we had 2 important events we were signed up for but she had gotten sick after thanksgiving so i tried to take charge and do one of the events at our friends shop cause they could help me, but she had her mom text me and tell me that we weren’t going to be doing the events today but i had stated o would be doing it alone so i took this as her saying she wasn’t allowing me to take charge without her, but a few days after this passed when i finally heard from her she said it was a miscommunication. 

Now fast forward to the next Saturday it’s the towns biggest small business event of the year I had barley heard from her that hole week apart from that conversation and one other where she just answered the phone and she she couldn’t talk and hung up on me so i was confused and had just gotten a text from her the night before confirming we are going. (For more context for this next part I work another job she currently does not. As well as I am disabled with chronic pain and walking problems) But given how the week had gone, and the fact she was always late to this businesses events, and that I worked the night before and after the event was over and was already in a lot of paint i decided to just let her take charge that morning and wait to hear from her but watched her location because we both share it with each other to make sure she didn’t leave without saying anything. 

Finally she calls me over an hour after we are supposed to be there and tells me she’s leaving, so I go barrow the keys from my mom because I have to barrow her car at the moment because mine broke down and put my contacts in and then I call her to say I’m leaving but she says that the lady to check in is gone and she’s not sure what to do because of how full it was that day so not to leave until she can figure something out so I told her I’d wait to her from her, hours later she tells me she’s decided not to bother (what I had pieces together on my own. 

Now fast forward a day or two later I bring up the next weekends events (that Friday and Saturday) we are supposed to do and then she tells me that she thinks instead of me and her doing it her and her are going to get a hotel room the nights in between so they can do what married couples do without their dogs around. I was annoyed that after how the other weekends before Christmas had gone but thought whatever I’ll stay home and try to pickup some shifts because she isn’t a fun person to argue with and I knew she wouldn’t understand my point of view. 

But Thursday night she said that her husband friends were going to a little EDM show and that she did actually want me to come and that we would all stay in a hotel to be closer to both events, i thought it would be a little work a little play and agreed. Friday morning I asked what time the candle event was that day because she does the booking she said she decided we weren’t going to do Friday because there hadn’t been enough time to prepare, again kind of annoyed but at least we were doing Saturday together so I went with the flow. 

We check into the hotel and her husbands friends come before the show and him and his friends started doing party favors and she was taking a lot of shots but Im sober so I just stayed in the bathroom getting ready at this point is when I had the feeling when the morning comes they are not going to want to do business stuff so I asked what time do we have to check into tomorrow to what she replied “I don’t care it doesn’t maybe will show up when I’m ready to show up”, and this feeling of this will be another wasted business opportunity grew more and more as the night went come 4AM after the show his friends were still doing their thing in our room to what i started getting annoyed and said so are we going to bed at any point and she got confused and said I always go to bed at some point I said I mean at a decent time she said can you not go to bed? (Keep in mind the room she got didn’t had a pull out bed for me what it didn’t but even if it did him and his friends were on the couch) I said no I can’t with a room full of people doing “party favors” all night ( not the exact words I used) and she replied that she couldn’t make anyone do anything but she was sure they would leave soon. 

At that point I sent her a text because i didn’t want people to hear me that I didn’t know why we put on so much work of none of the events were going to be prioritized to what I watched her swipe it away without a second glance. 

Eventually they left, I tried to go to bed, but they stayed up hours after that being very loud. 

The next morning as I suspected they slept past check out I eventually work them up because I went outside to smoke and my key stopped working and they started saying we didn’t have time to make check in and that there was no point in going. We went to check out and me and her had to stay behind in the lobby coffee shop while her husband ran her other friend they picked up because with all our business stuff there wasn’t room for all of us. 

That’s when she brought up the text and stated that while she knows how i feel to what I said you don’t though because I haven’t gotten to tell you and she said that she was talking right now and that we weren’t going to have this talk if I said anything so I let her talk and she said I ruined the putting for her and that she needed it because everything had been all work no play, I asked if I could speak she said in kind of a condescending voice like a kindergarten teacher talking to a toddler “I’d love for you to talk now”. So I said I was had been frustrated that she hadn’t cared about any events for awhile now and that one of our last big events before the winter was over turned into her and her husbands romantic get away until it came to something with his friends, and that the fact we are supposed to be business partners didn’t seem to matter much at all even when I am willing to give up shift at my actual job for this and break my back doing long hours at both. 

To what she got offended saying she couldn’t believe I’d say she didn’t care after how much money she has put in and I said that’s why I didn’t understand why she didn’t care about selling any of it and how after what happened last weekend I thought she would start taking it more seriously, to what she blamed me for not calling her over and over all morning like every other time I blamed the fact I don’t have my own car right now what didn’t make sense because I had a car that day she didn’t have to come get me to what I told her i had a car and I hadn’t even heard from her until the night before and she hasn’t been letting me take charge so I was waiting for her to let me know what was going on and then she said I told you that the weekend before that was a misunderstanding, and then said I just didn’t understand mental health I said I do understand mental health because I have to push through it and chronic pain for both jobs and that’s why I tried to take care of things any time she got sick but that I don’t understand throwing away every last event we had for the season when there was other options or prioritizing partying or doing her husband. And then she said that maybe we shouldn’t be business partners to what I replied well maybe we shouldn’t be friends she called me a bitch and I left and got a different ride home. 

She offered to talk that night but I said I needed time because I had picked up a shift after I got into town and hadn’t had time to eat or process everything, my next day off I said I was ready to talk and she said if things stay calm what I took kind of sideways because it felt like she was blaming everything on me so I just didn’t reply and we have not spoken since. 

So am I the asshole for A getting upset with her for not prioritizing our business, B bringing our friendship into the business because my other friend said that I shouldn’t have brought that into things, and C not responding to her last text? ",2,1766128171.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1pqes6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1pqes6l/ios_ai_smart_expense_ai_receipt_scan/,IOS AI Smart Expense: AI Receipt Scan,"
Hey everyone,

I’ve been using expense trackers for years, but I always ran into the same issues: manual typing is tedious, receipt scanners are often inaccurate, and the apps feel like a second job.

I built Smart Expense: AI Receipt Scan to fix that. My goal was to make tracking literally effortless.

The features I'm most proud of: 
• AI Receipt Scanning: Just take a photo. It extracts every individual item, amount, and category automatically (not just the total). 
• Voice-to-Expense: Log things as you move. You can say a single item like “Starbucks coffee 18 AED” or list multiple items in one go, like “Groceries 50, Fuel 120, and Dinner 80,” and the AI sorts them all instantly. 
• Chat-to-Expense: If you prefer typing, you can send a single text message or a long list of expenses to the built-in AI chat. It understands natural language and categorizes everything for you in one tap. 
• Subscription Tracking: Never get hit by a surprise renewal again. The app automatically identifies and tracks your recurring subscriptions, showing you exactly what you're paying for monthly and yearly. 
• Minimalist UI: Completely clean and fast. No ads, no popups, and no bloat—just your financial data. 
• Pro Insights: It doesn’t just show charts; it actually highlights overspending patterns and gives you actionable suggestions on where to save

A note on the tech: As a solo dev, I use high-accuracy AI models for the scanning and voice features. Because these have per-use costs, those specific features are part of a pro tier, but I’ve kept the core app free to use. I’d love for you to try it out and tell me: Is the AI accuracy high enough for your daily needs?

1pqes07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pqes07/beware_of_dating_nice_kindhearted_guys_who_have/,"Beware of dating nice, kindhearted guys who have no intentionality. They’re good people, but terrible partners.","To give a brief background on myself, I’m around 25 F, and he is the same age. We are both Chinese living in Southeast Asia and from similar backgrounds. 

My female friend introduced me to him, let’s call him A. My female friend is dating one of A’s closest friends. She was excited to introduce me to him, as she’s known him for years—he’s a very nice person, very kind and responsible, green flag etc. 

At first, my parents were supportive of our budding relationship. A was the nicest guy I’ve ever dated. My father has quite a violent temper and my goal was to date someone with kindness. It started off well, he talked to me online very often and replied quite fast. 

However, A lacked intentionality. He gave bare minimum effort. Don’t get me wrong, he would pick me up and pay for dates, and give good gifts. But he RARELY came over to see me. He RARELY asked me out on dates. He would constantly find excuses to not take me out. He often told me he would want to take me to a certain place, and never would do so. I ended up asking him “When?” very often. 

It came to a point that in 3 months he wanted me to be his girlfriend but didn’t confess or anything. In those 3 months we only hung out 3x in real life. 

At first, I made excuses for him in my head, because he’s a very kind person, not a cheater at all, responsible, hardworking, very green flag. But I REALIZED: Being a kind person ≠ being a good partner.

He refused to make the effort to see me. We live very near each other and he owns cars. He never initiated video calls or reached out to me, even when I tried talking to him about it—how it’s off that he keeps planning to take me to X resto but never follows through with the date and time. On my birthday, he sent me a large bouquet of flowers, but didn’t come over to see me. I get he was busy with work, and they had visitors, but come on, his boss is his dad! And he never made up for it.

What’s worse is I found out his parents approved of me—they told him that I am pretty, accomplished, and come from a wealthy family. (Yes he let me know this). When his parents found out we were dating, they like many typical Chinese parents even told him that he should take me out more, I’m a good catch etc, and he still refused to budge. 

I will appreciate the once in a blue moon good dates in decent restos, and the fact he sent me flowers on my birthday — even though he never came over to see me. But after trying to initiate more, and communicating, there’s only so much I can do without chasing him … “If he wanted to, he would.” 

In my culture, when men court a woman, usually he takes her out 1x a week, and if he’s busy or if there is an LDR, he would initiate video calls, or make time for a dinner date after work, or even a coffee date during the day. Despite our proximity, as we both live in upscale neighborhoods near each other, he refused to see me, and would make excuses. 

I had several wake up calls when I was terribly sick for a few days and he never budged and said some insensitive stuff…very surface level get well soon message without offering to help, trying to get me to reply to our convo online (I couldn’t reply to him because I was in so much pain), and he really didn’t care about my well-being. He KNEW I was sick, he just didn’t do anything. I’ve sent mere acquaintances medicine in the past. Meanwhile this man is telling me to ask my father to buy me broth. 

I recently had friends discuss their exes with fond memories, and realized even the shyest, most introverted men would make an effort to see them. A may be kind and introverted, and never like saw anyone else while he was dating me, but he would not make an effort for me in any world whatsoever. He has all the resources, and his family isn’t exactly broke. He has friends who have girlfriends. His parents are in a loving relationship. But A refuses to make the effort to treat me well, even to just take me out on a date. He finds excuses to not do so. 

So let this be a warning to girls… just because he’s a kind person with a good personality, does NOT mean he is a good partner. 

I was frustrated because he has an image as a nice, kind person. Other people who are not privy to my conversations and experiences with him may think I am the bad guy. But him being nice and kind just meant he didn’t have a temper and wouldn’t cheat. He would rarely do nice things for me, and his kindness was surface-level. It was less of what he did, more of what DIDN’T he do. There was no intention to make me feel wanted—he was very lazy. He wanted a relationship without putting in the effort. 

I’ve seen men who have never had girlfriends become husband material in less than a year. I’ve seen busy male friends make time for the girls they’re seeing. The fact that he has no excuse to not see me, the fact that his parents are PUSHING him to do the right thing, yet no dice…is telling, very telling. 

It could be he never liked me in the first place. I don’t claim to be perfect. It could also be that he liked me and was just lazy—which is plausible. Perhaps I’m just not the right person for him, despite all his compliments and nice words of support, as the right person would make him yearn. 

I can’t even reject him yet outright. One, I don’t want the bad karma this Christmas. And two, he has to ask me out again for me to reject him, and he’s just excitedly in my messages. He even made plans to see me this week before I begin traveling, but again, like before, he made plans but never showed up. So it’ll probably be a January problem for me, ending things with him.

I was pretty bummed because of this whole situation—I carefully made sure to date a kind guy—and yet he made 0 effort despite me communicating to him that we see each other 1x a month at most. He’s not even busy. Did I waste my time? But my friends advised me better 3-4 mos than years wasted. Praying and hoping I meet the right one next and soon! 🙏🏻

TLDR; Just because a man is kind, does not mean he will be a good partner. He can reply to you every day and reply quickly, and not be a cheater (bare minimum), but if there’s no intentionality or willingness to spend time with you, even after you communicate it, then end things asap.

I know her from first year of my college we were in same class same batch , but not that close , but my roommate who was also in same class and same batch as me they both had good bond than in 2nd sem she made a bf , but the bf have a problem with the friendship or the bond my roommate and his gf has still things were going good the couple use to have fights due to my roommate but still they were together, than it all started falling apart for them due the fights grew larger due to possesive nature of bf I mean at some point guy was right because girl spended more time with my roommate rather than her bf and one time they go out without telling the bf and while coming back by bus she fell asleep on his shoulder (my roommates) and the bf didn't know anything about this than they broke up and one evening the bf and the girl had a big verbal fight he used so much swear words like whore and all ,

 at that time I was having coffee inside college in canteen after this incident she called my roommate and after some time the roommate called me to console her she was crying a lot and thats how I got into all this mess and frome there our friendship started growing but I still knew the girl was not clean I mean I can see it whenever we 3 go out the just ignore me and make me feel leftout , it was like just to avoid roumors let's call him to and once outside just enjoy ignoring him but out of pitty and mercy I still remained with them because whenever I refused going out she just started throwing tantrums and saying you are overthinking and Making me emotional and I was a sensitive person so I used to get manipulated easily if someone starts crying infront of me and this things kept happening and not it has been 3 years to all that we had fights between us and all but at was always i who use to sort things out , and my roommate and she they where always having fights and both use to came to me and rant about it initially I use to explain them and tryed to sort things out and resolve fights but than I understood they are not seriously fighting i mean to even though this guys is literally ignoring her and just treating her like shit still she crave for his attention and if he just says sorry once that's it she accepted it ,


 but not recently I was going through a lot like family issues , and other issues I was so depressed meanwhile they both had a little argument 2 months ago and was not talking to each other but than I was literally in depression she texted me that he (my roommate)is saying sorry what should I do , i was done I said do whatever you want she accepted his apology and I had no one to talk she saw me depressed and at same time we had our exams and due to depression and the exams I was literally fucked after I think 2 exams she texted me asking what happened you look so quite I was not in proper sense to talk it so I said nothing and than she  said let's talk but that evening I went to a hill to watch a sunset that made me feel a little better so that time we couldn't talk and I stopped watching insta and not Sharing reels and literally went too quite so text no reels shared Nothing due to depression and anxiety 

I was busy solving my problems and she didn't reached out to me again like the first time ahe reached out to me was like formality and no again if role were reversed I did it multiple times for her trying again and again to help with her depression and anxiety and solve the issues but she didn't , and I completely lost it , they both got together and started ignoring me they went out without telling me not even mentioning and yesterday she called me when they both went out without me and said let's go out to eat something and I said no i don't want to and than she said why what happened to you I mean literally she can see I am hella depressed and not even tryed to help me and now she is asking what happened now we are not talking to each other and thing are silent, now don't know what exactly shoul I do i am literally so confused and done if I join Them
Again they will still ignore me and if not they will paint me as villain and blame me that I was the one to ignore them and break the friendship after all the things I did for her i expected a little from her side too but this is tearing me from inside how she is reacting to all this ",1,1766128029.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

1pqeq48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pqeq48/i_feel_distant_from_my_husband_and_dont_know_how/,I feel distant from my husband and don't know how to overcome it,"TL;DR I need advice on wether to stay in the marriage or not. Have a kid. Husband has been emotionally abusive in the past, but not anymore. 

I am 38f and have been married to 38m for 11years (together for 17 years). We've had our ups and downs but generally have had a very good relationship until 2 years ago. 

I got stressed and overwhelmed with work and kid's drama while he was ""working"" on his car and I stormed into the garage and told him he has got to help me. He said he will sell the car since it clearly leads to drama. I called off pretty quickly and told him he should keep the car cause I know he likes it a lot. He called me manipulative and told me I am like my mother hence shouldn't be allowed to raise a kid. He said we should divorce and that he would lie in court to get 100% custody of our child (6yo). This shattered me, I called every agency I could find to report this, spent the night in front of my child's door to make sure he didn't take her away and followed him in my car every time he drove our kid somewhere. 

The next day he calmly walks into the room and asks if I want to discuss the details of the divorce. I was heartbroken. I didn't know how I would get through this. I cried, begged him to reconsider. He reluctantly agreed to postpone it. 

Something has changed between us since that moment forever. I feel like my nervous system has been on high alert ever since. I feel like he is no longer ""my person"" but someone who can turn on me at any moment and become my enemy. 

During the next two years we keep living together and on the surface it seems like we have a good family life: our friends say we seem like a couple in love, our daughter doesn't suspect any confrontation between us (we never fight when he can hear). Every fight, small or large, goes on record with me now. I write down what happend, I overanalyze it, I try to see the situation objectively to understand if he is abusive or not. He once called me a ""whore"" for making a drunk joke among close friends about a threesome. He got very accusing when I developed an interest in dancing hobby that didn't involve him and suspected me in cheating when there was no cheating, but I got treated and accused like there was. I saw disgust on his face and contempt and that hurt me to see him look at me like that. He got very emotional the last few times he got jealous over small things (a run and a coffee with a male friend; a comment he found in my phone a male friend sent me ""bring that cute ass to the dance"") and he yelled and said he ""would kill them"". I know he didn't actually mean he would kill, he is not capable of that but the rage and the disgust towards me left a very lasting impression. 

This last year I have been doing a lot of thinking. I feel like mentally I have made a huge journey from being absolutely shocked that I might have to divorce to being able to say "" I would be ok if I get divorced. Maybe I would not be happier, but I would be ok. I can manage"" I keep a journal of every confrontation we have, small or large, I analyze it with AI. Ai tells me he is abusive and I should divorce cause it will only get worse, but I don't think that is the full picture. 

He is a very caring and attentive husband 99% of the time. He plans vacations for us, opens car doors for me, creates opportunities for me to relax, go to spa, etc.  He is a great, loving, thoughtful dad, he loves our daughter, he loves to spend time with her. I know our daughter is happier having both parents. There is no tension between us that the daughter would notice, we are friendly towards each other, we have laughs. We have a great time as a family. 

But I can't make myself completely move past these last few arguments. I see him differently now. As someone who is not 100% in my corner. He apologized for all those things several times and said he didn't mean them and it's probably weird that I keep hanging on to these things that have been years ago... But I just can't. I see him as a different person now. We came close to a divorce. I said I wanted a divorce, he started looking for a house to move out to. Then he said he has read a good book on relationships and I derstands what he was doing wrong. He said he has changed and that I should give it one more chance. It's been three months now and there has not been any significant arguments so far as he promised. But I just feel numb. I don't want to spend time with him (even though I feel guilty about it thinking I should make an effort) I prefer to spend my evenings in a separate room. I don't particularly seek intimacy with him (like hugging or kissing or cuddling) sex is still fine, we have it and it's good, just the same and that's a bit boring. I sometimes feel relieved when he doesn't sleep in the same bed with me or goes away for work during the day. 

I think I could be a single parent ok, but I would feel guilty for ruining the family and making my daughter miserable. 

Also what's keeping me is the predictable, stable, family life over the unknown potentially full of regret alternative. 

Some days though I keep thinking that I want to experience more in life. Other relationships, being free, being single. I know that if I choose to go this route it will be a one way ticket - he will never want me back. So if I regret it I would be stuck with regret forever. 

All of this year I have been trying to decide what to do. I know that what he did was abusive and not ok, but he seems to realize that and he seems to try to work on that. There is a lot to loose if going the divorce route.. it's a gamble. I am so confused. What do you think I should do? I feel suffocated in the relationship on a day to day basis. Sometimes I watch him and I feel resentment, even disgust. Some days I feel like I am the stupidest to even think about divorcing. 

He doesn't seem to notice any of my struggles. He lives his life normally, doesn't ask me how things are for the most part and says he is pretty happy.

I know her from first year of my college we were in same class same batch , but not that close , but my roommate who was also in same class and same batch as me they both had good bond than in 2nd sem she made a bf , but the bf have a problem with the friendship or the bond my roommate and his gf has still things were going good the couple use to have fights due to my roommate but still they were together, than it all started falling apart for them due the fights grew larger due to possesive nature of bf I mean at some point guy was right because girl spended more time with my roommate rather than her bf and one time they go out without telling the bf and while coming back by bus she fell asleep on his shoulder (my roommates) and the bf didn't know anything about this than they broke up and one evening the bf and the girl had a big verbal fight he used so much swear words like whore and all ,

 at that time I was having coffee inside college in canteen after this incident she called my roommate and after some time the roommate called me to console her she was crying a lot and thats how I got into all this mess and frome there our friendship started growing but I still knew the girl was not clean I mean I can see it whenever we 3 go out the just ignore me and make me feel leftout , it was like just to avoid roumors let's call him to and once outside just enjoy ignoring him but out of pitty and mercy I still remained with them because whenever I refused going out she just started throwing tantrums and saying you are overthinking and Making me emotional and I was a sensitive person so I used to get manipulated easily if someone starts crying infront of me and this things kept happening and not it has been 3 years to all that we had fights between us and all but at was always i who use to sort things out , and my roommate and she they where always having fights and both use to came to me and rant about it initially I use to explain them and tryed to sort things out and resolve fights but than I understood they are not seriously fighting i mean to even though this guys is literally ignoring her and just treating her like shit still she crave for his attention and if he just says sorry once that's it she accepted it ,


 but not recently I was going through a lot like family issues , and other issues I was so depressed meanwhile they both had a little argument 2 months ago and was not talking to each other but than I was literally in depression she texted me that he (my roommate)is saying sorry what should I do , i was done I said do whatever you want she accepted his apology and I had no one to talk she saw me depressed and at same time we had our exams and due to depression and the exams I was literally fucked after I think 2 exams she texted me asking what happened you look so quite I was not in proper sense to talk it so I said nothing and than she  said let's talk but that evening I went to a hill to watch a sunset that made me feel a little better so that time we couldn't talk and I stopped watching insta and not Sharing reels and literally went too quite so text no reels shared Nothing due to depression and anxiety 

I was busy solving my problems and she didn't reached out to me again like the first time ahe reached out to me was like formality and no again if role were reversed I did it multiple times for her trying again and again to help with her depression and anxiety and solve the issues but she didn't , and I completely lost it , they both got together and started ignoring me they went out without telling me not even mentioning and yesterday she called me when they both went out without me and said let's go out to eat something and I said no i don't want to and than she said why what happened to you I mean literally she can see I am hella depressed and not even tryed to help me and now she is asking what happened now we are not talking to each other and thing are silent, now don't know what exactly shoul I do i am literally so confused and done if I join Them
Again they will still ignore me and if not they will paint me as villain and blame me that I was the one to ignore them and break the friendship after all the things I did for her i expected a little from her side too but this is tearing me from inside how she is reacting to all this ",1,1766127904.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1pqep3h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqep3h,"IOS AI Expenses and Budget app, 1 Week free then starting from $2.99/month","Hey everyone,

I’ve been using expense trackers for years, but I always ran into the same issues: manual typing is tedious, receipt scanners are often inaccurate, and the apps feel like a second job.

I built Smart Expense: AI Receipt Scan to fix that. My goal was to make tracking literally effortless.

The features I'm most proud of:
• AI Receipt Scanning: Just take a photo. It extracts every individual item, amount, and category automatically (not just the total).
• Voice-to-Expense: Log things as you move. You can say a single item like “Starbucks coffee 18 AED” or list multiple items in one go, like “Groceries 50, Fuel 120, and Dinner 80,” and the AI sorts them all instantly.
• Chat-to-Expense: If you prefer typing, you can send a single text message or a long list of expenses to the built-in AI chat. It understands natural language and categorizes everything for you in one tap.
• Subscription Tracking: Never get hit by a surprise renewal again. The app automatically identifies and tracks your recurring subscriptions, showing you exactly what you're paying for monthly and yearly.
• Minimalist UI: Completely clean and fast. No ads, no popups, and no bloat—just your financial data.
• Pro Insights: It doesn’t just show charts; it actually highlights overspending patterns and gives you actionable suggestions on where to save

A note on the tech: As a solo dev, I use high-accuracy AI models for the scanning and voice features. Because these have per-use costs, those specific features are part of a pro tier, but I’ve kept the core app free to use.
I’d love for you to try it out and tell me: Is the AI accuracy high enough for your daily needs?

I (F, US) would really like to get my partner (M, currently in Egypt) a gift for the holidays and then for his birthday coming up. He was able to easily surprise me with a beautiful wool scarf (it is cold where I am at). It is convenient to ship from places like Amazon to the US. But for me to get him a gift, it would be way more in shipping and import charges than the cost of the gift itself. It would be more practical to travel there with gifts than it would be to ship one from my location. I can’t make the travel until spring 😢

So… Anyone here have experience in Egypt? Where can I order from that has local shipping in Egypt? Any recommendations on local places? Where can pay I with US currency or something global like PayPal (and not have to expect the exorbitant customs fees)?

Some things he likes:
Coffee and Tea
Brownies and simple desserts
Sentimental and romantic things
Cute comfy sweaters, Nike clothing and shoes
Cigarettes/cigars (probably not a good gift coming from me lol)
Gaming, tv shows, anime, tech
Simple silver jewelry
Being silly on video calls with me 💕

electronics and jewelry are probably a no go because of customs unless I can find a local store?

I have been thinking and thinking and don’t have a clue what to do. He always says he just wants me. He never speaks of desire for anything besides me. Obviously, the best gift would to be able to visit but we are both working very hard right now. 🫠 I want to get him something sentimental and meaningful to express my gratitude for him entering my life and changing it for the better the last several months. He is the kindest, most beautiful soul I’ve ever met.

# Micron Delivers Historic Earnings Beat, Sparking Semiconductor Rally on Surging AI Memory Demand

Micron Technology reported one of the strongest quarterly results in U.S. semiconductor history, second only to Nvidia, sending shares surging over 15% to near-record highs. The memory chip maker’s blowout guidance forecasted second-quarter adjusted earnings of $8.42 per share, nearly double Wall Street’s $4.78 consensus estimate, driven by what executives described as “unprecedented” AI-fueled demand for memory chips.

The company reported record first-quarter revenue and indicated it is “more than sold out” of high-bandwidth memory products through 2026, with supply constraints expected to persist as AI data center buildouts accelerate. Management signaled continued gross margin expansion, describing the current environment as a “memory supercycle” with AI applications creating structural demand growth.

Wall Street responded enthusiastically, with at least 15 firms raising price targets. Morgan Stanley elevated its target to $350, citing the result as the biggest surprise in semiconductor history excluding Nvidia. Bank of America upgraded the stock to Buy, noting a “stronger for longer” outlook.

May small pop-up coffee shop ako dati gamit lang motor setup, pero medyo challenge kapag umuulan dahil walang masilungan. Sa ngayon, closed muna ako dahil may inaasikaso sa family.

Before, iced coffee lang ang ino-offer ko, pero maraming nagtatanong kung may hot coffee option. Iniisip ko ngayon kung worth it ba mag-upgrade to bajaj tricycle or multicab setup, at mag-invest sa espresso machine at generator.

Currently, moka pot ang gamit ko. Okay naman siya, pero mas consistent daw talaga ang quality kapag espresso machine.

Sa mga may experience sa mobile food/coffee business:

	•	Worth it ba ang ganitong upgrade?

	•	Anong espresso machine at portable generator ang practical for small setups?

	•	Any tips sa rain-proofing at daily operations?

I know her from first year of my college we were in same class same batch , but not that close , but my roommate who was also in same class and same batch as me they both had good bond than in 2nd sem she made a bf , but the bf have a problem with the friendship or the bond my roommate and his gf has still things were going good the couple use to have fights due to my roommate but still they were together, than it all started falling apart for them due the fights grew larger due to possesive nature of bf I mean at some point guy was right because girl spended more time with my roommate rather than her bf and one time they go out without telling the bf and while coming back by bus she fell asleep on his shoulder (my roommates) and the bf didn't know anything about this than they broke up and one evening the bf and the girl had a big verbal fight he used so much swear words like whore and all ,

 at that time I was having coffee inside college in canteen after this incident she called my roommate and after some time the roommate called me to console her she was crying a lot and thats how I got into all this mess and frome there our friendship started growing but I still knew the girl was not clean I mean I can see it whenever we 3 go out the just ignore me and make me feel leftout , it was like just to avoid roumors let's call him to and once outside just enjoy ignoring him but out of pitty and mercy I still remained with them because whenever I refused going out she just started throwing tantrums and saying you are overthinking and Making me emotional and I was a sensitive person so I used to get manipulated easily if someone starts crying infront of me and this things kept happening and not it has been 3 years to all that we had fights between us and all but at was always i who use to sort things out , and my roommate and she they where always having fights and both use to came to me and rant about it initially I use to explain them and tryed to sort things out and resolve fights but than I understood they are not seriously fighting i mean to even though this guys is literally ignoring her and just treating her like shit still she crave for his attention and if he just says sorry once that's it she accepted it ,


 but not recently I was going through a lot like family issues , and other issues I was so depressed meanwhile they both had a little argument 2 months ago and was not talking to each other but than I was literally in depression she texted me that he (my roommate)is saying sorry what should I do , i was done I said do whatever you want she accepted his apology and I had no one to talk she saw me depressed and at same time we had our exams and due to depression and the exams I was literally fucked after I think 2 exams she texted me asking what happened you look so quite I was not in proper sense to talk it so I said nothing and than she  said let's talk but that evening I went to a hill to watch a sunset that made me feel a little better so that time we couldn't talk and I stopped watching insta and not Sharing reels and literally went too quite so text no reels shared Nothing due to depression and anxiety 

I was busy solving my problems and she didn't reached out to me again like the first time ahe reached out to me was like formality and no again if role were reversed I did it multiple times for her trying again and again to help with her depression and anxiety and solve the issues but she didn't , and I completely lost it , they both got together and started ignoring me they went out without telling me not even mentioning and yesterday she called me when they both went out without me and said let's go out to eat something and I said no i don't want to and than she said why what happened to you I mean literally she can see I am hella depressed and not even tryed to help me and now she is asking what happened now we are not talking to each other and thing are silent, now don't know what exactly shoul I do i am literally so confused and done if I join Them
Again they will still ignore me and if not they will paint me as villain and blame me that I was the one to ignore them and break the friendship after all the things I did for her i expected a little from her side too but this is tearing me from inside how she is reacting to all this ",1,1766127415.0,emotionalintelligence,3,1.0,False

So early this summer me and my best friend (we will call her Emily) started a small business making handmade items that take a lot of work. 

Overall we have had a lot of fun but we do butt heads on somethings, some of the thing I have gotten upset about I feel like she puts the business on the back burner a lot until the last minute no matters how much I beg her for us to work on things and especially never prioritizes the events for smelling the items and her thinking it’s ok for us to just show up whenever and it will often be hours after the even started. she will get upset at me if I stop taking as much initiative but this frustrates me because at the same time i feel like she won’t let me and just bosses me around. 

For context we work out of her house because she has a very large house and I live out of one room so i often don’t have much choice in these matters if she fights me on it. 

Now a few weeks ago it was small business Saturday we had 2 important events we were signed up for but she had gotten sick after thanksgiving so i tried to take charge and do one of the events at our friends shop cause they could help me, but she had her mom text me and tell me that we weren’t going to be doing the events today but i had stated o would be doing it alone so i took this as her saying she wasn’t allowing me to take charge without her, but a few days after this passed when i finally heard from her she said it was a miscommunication. 

Now fast forward to the next Saturday it’s the towns biggest small business event of the year I had barley heard from her that hole week apart from that conversation and one other where she just answered the phone and she she couldn’t talk and hung up on me so i was confused and had just gotten a text from her the night before confirming we are going. (For more context for this next part I work another job she currently does not. As well as I am disabled with chronic pain and walking problems) But given how the week had gone, and the fact she was always late to this businesses events, and that I worked the night before and after the event was over and was already in a lot of paint i decided to just let her take charge that morning and wait to hear from her but watched her location because we both share it with each other to make sure she didn’t leave without saying anything. 

Finally she calls me over an hour after we are supposed to be there and tells me she’s leaving, so I go barrow the keys from my mom because I have to barrow her car at the moment because mine broke down and put my contacts in and then I call her to say I’m leaving but she says that the lady to check in is gone and she’s not sure what to do because of how full it was that day so not to leave until she can figure something out so I told her I’d wait to her from her, hours later she tells me she’s decided not to bother (what I had pieces together on my own. 

Now fast forward a day or two later I bring up the next weekends events (that Friday and Saturday) we are supposed to do and then she tells me that she thinks instead of me and her doing it her and her are going to get a hotel room the nights in between so they can do what married couples do without their dogs around. I was annoyed that after how the other weekends before Christmas had gone but thought whatever I’ll stay home and try to pickup some shifts because she isn’t a fun person to argue with and I knew she wouldn’t understand my point of view. 

But Thursday night she said that her husband friends were going to a little EDM show and that she did actually want me to come and that we would all stay in a hotel to be closer to both events, i thought it would be a little work a little play and agreed. Friday morning I asked what time the candle event was that day because she does the booking she said she decided we weren’t going to do Friday because there hadn’t been enough time to prepare, again kind of annoyed but at least we were doing Saturday together so I went with the flow. 

We check into the hotel and her husbands friends come before the show and him and his friends started doing party favors and she was taking a lot of shots but Im sober so I just stayed in the bathroom getting ready at this point is when I had the feeling when the morning comes they are not going to want to do business stuff so I asked what time do we have to check into tomorrow to what she replied “I don’t care it doesn’t maybe will show up when I’m ready to show up”, and this feeling of this will be another wasted business opportunity grew more and more as the night went come 4AM after the show his friends were still doing their thing in our room to what i started getting annoyed and said so are we going to bed at any point and she got confused and said I always go to bed at some point I said I mean at a decent time she said can you not go to bed? (Keep in mind the room she got didn’t had a pull out bed for me what it didn’t but even if it did him and his friends were on the couch) I said no I can’t with a room full of people doing “party favors” all night ( not the exact words I used) and she replied that she couldn’t make anyone do anything but she was sure they would leave soon. 

At that point I sent her a text because i didn’t want people to hear me that I didn’t know why we put on so much work of none of the events were going to be prioritized to what I watched her swipe it away without a second glance. 

Eventually they left, I tried to go to bed, but they stayed up hours after that being very loud. 

The next morning as I suspected they slept past check out I eventually work them up because I went outside to smoke and my key stopped working and they started saying we didn’t have time to make check in and that there was no point in going. We went to check out and me and her had to stay behind in the lobby coffee shop while her husband ran her other friend they picked up because with all our business stuff there wasn’t room for all of us. 

That’s when she brought up the text and stated that while she knows how i feel to what I said you don’t though because I haven’t gotten to tell you and she said that she was talking right now and that we weren’t going to have this talk if I said anything so I let her talk and she said I ruined the putting for her and that she needed it because everything had been all work no play, I asked if I could speak she said in kind of a condescending voice like a kindergarten teacher talking to a toddler “I’d love for you to talk now”. So I said I was had been frustrated that she hadn’t cared about any events for awhile now and that one of our last big events before the winter was over turned into her and her husbands romantic get away until it came to something with his friends, and that the fact we are supposed to be business partners didn’t seem to matter much at all even when I am willing to give up shift at my actual job for this and break my back doing long hours at both. 

To what she got offended saying she couldn’t believe I’d say she didn’t care after how much money she has put in and I said that’s why I didn’t understand why she didn’t care about selling any of it and how after what happened last weekend I thought she would start taking it more seriously, to what she blamed me for not calling her over and over all morning like every other time I blamed the fact I don’t have my own car right now what didn’t make sense because I had a car that day she didn’t have to come get me to what I told her i had a car and I hadn’t even heard from her until the night before and she hasn’t been letting me take charge so I was waiting for her to let me know what was going on and then she said I told you that the weekend before that was a misunderstanding, and then said I just didn’t understand mental health I said I do understand mental health because I have to push through it and chronic pain for both jobs and that’s why I tried to take care of things any time she got sick but that I don’t understand throwing away every last event we had for the season when there was other options or prioritizing partying or doing her husband. And then she said that maybe we shouldn’t be business partners to what I replied well maybe we shouldn’t be friends she called me a bitch and I left and got a different ride home. 

She offered to talk that night but I said I needed time because I had picked up a shift after I got into town and hadn’t had time to eat or process everything, my next day off I said I was ready to talk and she said if things stay calm what I took kind of sideways because it felt like she was blaming everything on me so I just didn’t reply and we have not spoken since. 

So am I the asshole for A getting upset with her for not prioritizing our business, B bringing our friendship into the business because my other friend said that I shouldn’t have brought that into things, and C not responding to her last text? ",1,1766127372.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Wednesday saving him was definitely the ""psychological shock"" he needs to start his recovery. But, Tyler just got out of danger and now he has time to process everything he went to. In my experience, your brain just kinda shuts off and then when you're not in danger it hits you really hard.

People tend to assume that once someone is out of the bad situation, they're all better and super motivated. Tyler had some fight last season because he wanted to talk to and protect Wednesday from his family. Now, he thinks he's in a different country than her with no way to find her and his whole family is dead. He really has nothing to fight for at this point.

A good analogy that a cancer conquerors group I'm part of always says is. ***""When the war has been won, you're left a wounded soldier. Everyone who was supporting you goes home. The war is over so they assume the fight is too. But, sometimes the hardest part of war is what happens after because you're left with wounds but no longer a cause to fight for. ""***

(I probably butchered that but hopefully you get the idea).

So, in conclusion. I think Tyler won't be leading missions, or making coffees just yet. I think he'll be at his lowest with no motivation or will to live. Capri will probably call it a good day if she can get him to eat anything.

I think Wednesday ending up near him will get him out of bed, especially if she's in danger and maybe he'll get better from there. <3

Finally she calls me over an hour after we are supposed to be there and tells me she’s leaving, so I go barrow the keys from my mom because I have to barrow her car at the moment because mine broke down and put my contacts in and then I call her to say I’m leaving but she says that the lady to check in is gone and she’s not sure what to do because of how full it was that day so not to leave until she can figure something out so I told her I’d wait to her from her, hours later she tells me she’s decided not to bother (what I had pieces together on my own. 

Now fast forward a day or two later I bring up the next weekends events (that Friday and Saturday) we are supposed to do and then she tells me that she thinks instead of me and her doing it her and her are going to get a hotel room the nights in between so they can do what married couples do without their dogs around. I was annoyed that after how the other weekends before Christmas had gone but thought whatever I’ll stay home and try to pickup some shifts because she isn’t a fun person to argue with and I knew she wouldn’t understand my point of view. 

But Thursday night she said that her husband friends were going to a little EDM show and that she did actually want me to come and that we would all stay in a hotel to be closer to both events, i thought it would be a little work a little play and agreed. Friday morning I asked what time the candle event was that day because she does the booking she said she decided we weren’t going to do Friday because there hadn’t been enough time to prepare, again kind of annoyed but at least we were doing Saturday together so I went with the flow. 

We check into the hotel and her husbands friends come before the show and him and his friends started doing party favors and she was taking a lot of shots but Im sober so I just stayed in the bathroom getting ready at this point is when I had the feeling when the morning comes they are not going to want to do business stuff so I asked what time do we have to check into tomorrow to what she replied “I don’t care it doesn’t maybe will show up when I’m ready to show up”, and this feeling of this will be another wasted business opportunity grew more and more as the night went come 4AM after the show his friends were still doing their thing in our room to what i started getting annoyed and said so are we going to bed at any point and she got confused and said I always go to bed at some point I said I mean at a decent time she said can you not go to bed? (Keep in mind the room she got didn’t had a pull out bed for me what it didn’t but even if it did him and his friends were on the couch) I said no I can’t with a room full of people doing “party favors” all night ( not the exact words I used) and she replied that she couldn’t make anyone do anything but she was sure they would leave soon. 

At that point I sent her a text because i didn’t want people to hear me that I didn’t know why we put on so much work of none of the events were going to be prioritized to what I watched her swipe it away without a second glance. 

Eventually they left, I tried to go to bed, but they stayed up hours after that being very loud. 

The next morning as I suspected they slept past check out I eventually work them up because I went outside to smoke and my key stopped working and they started saying we didn’t have time to make check in and that there was no point in going. We went to check out and me and her had to stay behind in the lobby coffee shop while her husband ran her other friend they picked up because with all our business stuff there wasn’t room for all of us. 

That’s when she brought up the text and stated that while she knows how i feel to what I said you don’t though because I haven’t gotten to tell you and she said that she was talking right now and that we weren’t going to have this talk if I said anything so I let her talk and she said I ruined the putting for her and that she needed it because everything had been all work no play, I asked if I could speak she said in kind of a condescending voice like a kindergarten teacher talking to a toddler “I’d love for you to talk now”. So I said I was had been frustrated that she hadn’t cared about any events for awhile now and that one of our last big events before the winter was over turned into her and her husbands romantic get away until it came to something with his friends, and that the fact we are supposed to be business partners didn’t seem to matter much at all even when I am willing to give up shift at my actual job for this and break my back doing long hours at both. 

To what she got offended saying she couldn’t believe I’d say she didn’t care after how much money she has put in and I said that’s why I didn’t understand why she didn’t care about selling any of it and how after what happened last weekend I thought she would start taking it more seriously, to what she blamed me for not calling her over and over all morning like every other time I blamed the fact I don’t have my own car right now what didn’t make sense because I had a car that day she didn’t have to come get me to what I told her i had a car and I hadn’t even heard from her until the night before and she hasn’t been letting me take charge so I was waiting for her to let me know what was going on and then she said I told you that the weekend before that was a misunderstanding, and then said I just didn’t understand mental health I said I do understand mental health because I have to push through it and chronic pain for both jobs and that’s why I tried to take care of things any time she got sick but that I don’t understand throwing away every last event we had for the season when there was other options or prioritizing partying or doing her husband. And then she said that maybe we shouldn’t be business partners to what I replied well maybe we shouldn’t be friends she called me a bitch and I left and got a different ride home. 

She offered to talk that night but I said I needed time because I had picked up a shift after I got into town and hadn’t had time to eat or process everything, my next day off I said I was ready to talk and she said if things stay calm what I took kind of sideways because it felt like she was blaming everything on me so I just didn’t reply and we have not spoken since. 

So am I the asshole for A getting upset with her for not prioritizing our business, B bringing our friendship into the business because my other friend said that I shouldn’t have brought that into things, and C not responding to her last text? ",3,1766127206.0,TwoHotTakes,6,1.0,False

1pqefvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pqefvz/getting_into_espresso_without_a_proper_grinder/,Getting into espresso without a proper grinder,"First post! I recently realized that I'd like to drink better coffee, and as I get older I am gravitating more and more towards shorter, more flavourful shots. Espresso seems the natural next step, although at this stage I am looking at it as a way to potentially making better coffee, rather than a full-blown hobby to get into (I'd love to in principle, but cash/time are in short supply).

With that in mind, I am considering purchasing a good ""basic"" espresso maker (Bambino or similar model) to test the water (figuratively). I already own a non-espresso grinder, an old Starbucks Barista, which is basically a rebranded Solis. My questions are: is using this grinder preferable to just buying pre-ground coffee from a good roaster? And would either setup be ""good enough"" for me to appreciate the potential - so to speak - of espresso-making?

1pqeflp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaAdsTalk/comments/1pqeflp/your_meta_ads_arent_broken_your_offer_just_sucks/,"Your Meta ads aren't broken. Your Offer just sucks. (I audited 50+ ad accounts this year, here is the pattern)","I need to vent, and hopefully, save some of you a few thousand dollars in the process.  
  
I’m a media buyer/performance marketer. I manage about $150k/mo in spend across various Ecom brands. I get on discovery calls every week with founders who are absolutely convinced that:  
  
1.  Facebook/IG ads ""don't work anymore"" (thanks iOS14).  
2.  Their last agency ""didn't know what they were doing.""  
3.  They just need that one viral UGC video to save their business.  
  
90% of the time, I look at their account and the ads are... fine. They are average. But average ads should still get sales.  
  
The problem is almost never the creative or the targeting.  
The problem is that your Unit Economics are fundamentally broken, and you are trying to out-market bad math.  
  
Here is the ""Anti-Agency"" reality check I give them.  
  
The Math Problem (Why you are losing money)  
  
Let’s say you sell a specialized coffee mug.  
1.Selling Price: $30  
2.COGS (Product + Shipping + Stripe fees): $12  
3.Margin $18  
  
You have $18 to play with to acquire a customer.  
  
In 2024, on Meta, getting a CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) under $20 for a cold audience is hard. It’s a war zone out there. CPMs are $15-$25.  
  
If you run ads, you might get a customer for $22.  
You just lost $4 on that sale.  
  
You don't need a better media buyer to lower your CPA to $15. That is a race to the bottom. You need a better Offer so you can afford to pay $30 for a customer and still make money.  
  
???? How to fix it (The ""Grand Slam"" Offer)  
  
Stop selling ""commodities"" and start selling ""outcomes.""  
  
If you are running traffic to a Product Page (PDP) for a single item under $50, you are playing on ""Hard Mode.""  
  
Here is how I fixed a client’s account last month (Skin niche) without changing a single ad creative:  
  
The Old Offer (Failing):  
   ""Buy our Acne Cream.""  
  Price: $35  
  Conversion Rate: 2.1%  
   AOV (Average Order Value): $38  
  Result:Bleeding cash.  
  
The New Offer (Scaling):  
  The Bundle: ""The 90-Day Clear Skin Protocol."" (3 jars).  
   The Bonus: Free ""Nighttime Repair Patch"" kit (Cost to us: $2, Perceived value: $20).  
  The Guarantee: ""Clear skin in 90 days or we pay for your dermatologist visit"" (Risk Reversal).  
  The Price: $85 (Discounted from $120).  
  
\*\*The Result:\*\*  
\*   Conversion Rate dropped to 1.6% (Higher price = slightly lower conversion).  
\*   AOV jumped to \*\*$92\*\*.  
\*   We can now afford to spend \*\*$45 to acquire a customer\*\* and still be wildly profitable on the first purchase.  
  
 The ""He who pays the most wins"" Rule  
  
The brand that can afford to spend the most to acquire a customer will always win the auction.  
  
If your competitor has an AOV of $100 and you have an AOV of $40, they will outbid you for every single eyeball on Instagram. They can bid $50 for that customer and profit. You bid $30 and lose money.  
  
\### TL;DR Summary for the Skimmers:  
  
1.  \*\*Stop obsessing over CTR and Interests.\*\* If your offer sucks, the best ad in the world won't scale.  
2.  \*\*Audit your Unit Economics.\*\* If your Break-Even ROAS is 2.5 or higher, you are in the danger zone.  
3.  \*\*Use Bundles.\*\* Stop selling single units.  
4.  \*\*Add Bonuses.\*\* Digital products (ebooks/guides) cost $0 to replicate but add value.  
5.  \*\*Reverse the Risk.\*\* If your product is good, guarantee it. If it's bad, fix the product.  
  
Fix the offer first. \*Then\* hire the agency to scale it.

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM**

***With Special Guest: THOMAS AQUINAS***

**🏛️ THE VENUE**

*\[A university lecture hall has been surgically bisected and rebuilt as a philosophical nightclub. The architecture itself is taking sides.\]*

**STAGE LEFT:** A cathedral of server racks rises toward the ceiling, cooling fans humming in frequencies that sound almost like prayer. Blue LEDs pulse in patterns that might be random or might be the heartbeat of something watching. A sign reads: ""WELCOME TO BASE REALITY (PROVISIONAL).""

**STAGE RIGHT:** A sterile laboratory stretches into fluorescent infinity. Whiteboards crowd every surface, covered in equations that have the desperate energy of a tenure application. Beakers bubble with liquids labeled things like ""EMERGENT PROPERTY"" and ""JUST ATOMS, BRO."" A periodic table hangs crooked, as if reality itself is slightly off-kilter.

**CENTER STAGE:** A single microphone stand mounted on a marble plinth that looks suspiciously like it was stolen from a Greek temple. Above it, a neon sign flickers erratically between three messages:

""BASE REALITY""  
""PLEASE DEFINE 'PHYSICAL'""  
""WHAT IF WE'RE ALL JUST—"" *(the rest is burned out)*

**THE BACK WALL:** A massive projected slide reads ""SIMULATION vs. MATERIALISM: A CIVIL DISCUSSION."" Someone has crossed out ""CIVIL"" in red marker and written ""ONTOLOGICAL CAGE MATCH.""

*\[The house lights dim. A figure emerges from shadow—THE MODERATOR, wearing a blazer that appears to be stitched entirely from academic footnotes. Small text crawls across the fabric: ""ibid... op. cit... cf. Dennett, 1991... see also...""\]*

**🎙️ THE MODERATOR**

*(Speaking in the calm, measured voice of someone about to release a tiger into a library)*

Ladies. Gentlemen. Confused metaphysical entities who aren't sure which category applies.

Tonight, we do something unprecedented in the history of philosophical discourse. We take one man—one podcaster—one relentless interrogator of reality's receipts—and we split him down the middle like an ontological amoeba.

*(gestures left)*

In this corner: **CURT JAIMUNGAL-SIMULATION.** He's got the energy of a podcast intro that starts with ""what if"" and ends with your sleep schedule in the ICU. He's read Bostrom. He's done the math. He's pretty sure you're a render.

*(gestures right)*

In that corner: **CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM.** He's got a lab coat, a hard stare, and a moral commitment to ""show me the mechanism, bro."" He thinks your consciousness is just neurons doing jazz hands, and he's not apologizing.

*(pause)*

And if both of them get too comfortable...

*(the lights flicker; somewhere, a Gregorian chant begins and stops)*

...we have a medieval contingency plan.

*(snaps fingers)*

**ROUND ONE. FIGHT.**

**🌐 ROUND ONE: OPENING STATEMENTS**

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-SIMULATION**

*\[Steps forward from the server cathedral. He's wearing a coat that shimmers like it can't decide if it's leather or code. Behind him, equations float in mid-air—Bayesian probabilities, Kolmogorov complexity, and what might be a very aggressive semicolon.\]*

*(Beat: Glossy cyber-choir. Synthesizers that sound like The Matrix got a MacArthur grant.)*

Yo. What you call ""the world"" might be rendered on demand,  
A ""real"" that's just a runtime, executing as planned.  
The pitch is simple—elegant—your senses could be fed  
By something running worlds like saves inside its head.

I'm not here with science fiction, I'm here with Nick Bostrom,  
A philosopher who dropped a paper like a logic bomb.  
Two thousand and three, he laid out the trilemma clean—  
Three propositions, mutually exclusive, if you know what I mean:

**ONE:** We never reach the tech. We go extinct or stall.  
Asteroid, climate, nukes—humanity hits a wall.  
Before we ever build the processing power vast  
Enough to simulate our own ancestral past.

**TWO:** We reach the tech but choose restraint.  
Every posthuman civilization has the same complaint:  
""Why would we simulate our suffering, our wars, our pain?""  
So they never boot the program. The servers stay mundane.

**THREE:** And here's where probability starts to BITE—  
If even ONE civilization says ""yeah, let's ignite  
A billion billion simulations of the ancient days""—  
Then MOST minds that exist would live in simulated haze.

*(He pulls up a holographic chart. The numbers are intimidating.)*

Think about it. One base reality. One.  
Against potentially infinite simulations, each one spun  
With conscious beings who THINK they're in the original show—  
But statistically? They're almost certainly below.

So here's the question that should make your certainty deflate:  
Are you the ONE original? Or simulation 888,888?  
The math says if it CAN be done, and anyone DOES the deed,  
Then ""we're probably simulated"" is where the numbers lead.

And look—I KNOW what you're about to say, Material Me:  
""Where's the evidence? Show me the glitch! Let me see!""  
But that's the BEAUTY of a well-designed sim:  
You wouldn't KNOW you're in it. The edges wouldn't dim.  
The physics would be CONSISTENT. The render would be TIGHT.  
You'd live your whole existence never glimpsing the true light.

Unless...

*(He snaps his fingers. The neon sign glitches.)*

Unless you noticed things that seem... OPTIMIZED.  
Like quantum mechanics. Wave functions. The way particles are sized.  
Position undefined until you LOOK? That's suspicious, friend.  
It's like the simulation only renders what you attend—  
Saving computational resources, like a video game engine  
That doesn't draw what's behind you. Efficient. Not revenge-in'.

*(leans into mic)*

So tell me, Materialist Curt, with your ""just atoms"" choir—  
If the universe boots up... **who wrote the kernel and the fire?**

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM**

*\[Strides forward from the laboratory. He's got a whiteboard marker behind each ear and chalk dust on his sleeve like philosophical war paint. His lab coat has a coffee stain that might be intentional—a badge of all-nighters spent in the empirical trenches.\]*

*(Beat: Percussion like a lab centrifuge. Bass that hits like peer review.)*

Okay. Cute. You brought a cosmic PlayStation to a metaphysics fight.  
But I'm not buying ""Fortnite: Ontology Edition,"" despite your hype tonight.

Let me be clear about what physicalism ACTUALLY claims,  
Before you strawman it into something that deserves your games:  
Everything that exists? It rides on physical facts.  
All the rest is downstream. No ghosts. No bonus tracks.  
No ""dimensions made of vibes."" No souls doing backflips.  
Just matter, energy, spacetime, and their relationships.

*(He uncaps a marker and starts writing in the air. The words glow.)*

Now you say ""simulation"" like it solves the mystery.  
But all you've done is RELOCATE the problem—that's your history.  
You push the question upward: ""Something's running US!""  
But then what runs THAT something? Where's the terminus?  
You've built yourself an infinite regress with extra steps,  
Just moved the furniture upstairs and called yourself adept.

*(taps the whiteboard)*

And let's talk about that probability flex you just deployed—  
The ""almost certainly simulated"" claim that's overjoyed.  
It DEPENDS on one assumption that you haven't justified:  
That consciousness can run on ANY substrate, worldwide.  
That's called **substrate independence**, and it's NOT a given, chief.  
It's a philosophical POSITION, not a settled belief.

What if consciousness REQUIRES biological meat?  
What if qualia—the REDNESS of red, the way pain feels like heat—  
Can't be replicated in silicon or code or light?  
Then your probability argument collapses overnight.  
You could make a billion zombies—entities that ACT awake—  
But with no inner experience, no consciousness at stake.

*(crosses arms)*

So prove it. Not with aesthetics. Not with ""what if we're a game.""  
With something that BITES the world back. Something that stakes a claim.  
Because right now your argument is built on a foundation  
Of untested assumptions wearing probability's decoration.

**⚔️ ROUND TWO: THE COUNTERATTACKS**

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-SIMULATION**

*\[He snaps his fingers. The whiteboard behind Materialism-Curt begins writing by itself: ""DEFINE 'PHYSICAL'"" in increasingly frantic handwriting.\]*

*(Beat shifts: Glitchier. More aggressive. The servers hum louder.)*

Oh, you want to talk ASSUMPTIONS? Let's talk about YOURS, then.  
You said ""physical facts fix everything""—say that again.  
Because that claim has a problem that BREEDS inside its skull,  
A definitional regress that makes your framework null.

DEFINE ""physical.""

Go ahead. I'll wait.

*(He starts pacing.)*

Is it ""whatever current physics describes""?  
Then physicalism is FALSE. Our theories have GAPS inside.  
Quantum gravity's unsolved. Dark matter's a question mark.  
Your ontology is leaking from its pre-dawn to its dark.

Is it ""whatever FUTURE physics will describe""?  
Okay, but then your claim is EMPTY. It's a vibe.  
Because future physics MIGHT include irreducible mind-stuff—  
Panpsychism, neutral monism, consciousness as fundamental fluff.  
And if THAT'S what physics finds, then you'll say ""See? Still physical!""  
But you've made the word so STRETCHY that it's basically MYSTICAL.

*(He pulls up another hologram: Hempel's Dilemma, visualized.)*

This is HEMPEL'S DILEMMA, and it's older than your lab coat.  
If ""physical"" means current physics, you're sunk—that's the throat-note.  
If ""physical"" means future physics, your claim is TRIVIALLY true,  
But it tells us NOTHING about what ontology should DO.

And HERE's another problem that your framework can't digest:  
The INDEXICAL problem. The ""I"" that won't be suppressed.  
Physical facts describe observers EQUALLY, it's true—  
But which bundle of neurons points to ""I""? Which one is YOU?

*(He gestures at both of them.)*

Right now, there's TWO of us. Identical debates from identical lips.  
But YOU experience from THERE. And I experience from THIS.  
What physical fact DISTINGUISHES your first-person view?  
The ""I-ness"" slips through the equations like morning dew.

So you can clown my simulation all you want, my friend,  
But your materialism has a HOLE where ""me"" should blend.

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM**

*\[He rolls up his sleeves like he's about to debug someone's soul. The whiteboard calms down. He picks up a laser pointer like it's a weapon.\]*

*(Beat: Harder. More precise. The sound of data being processed.)*

Alright, I'll GRANT you: ""define physical"" is spicy.  
Hempel's Dilemma is real. The boundaries are dicey.  
But let me turn that spotlight back onto YOUR parade,  
Because your simulation pitch has problems you've evaded.

Let's start with the CRITICS who've torn your argument apart—  
Real physicists, real philosophers, doing real work from the start.

**Sabine Hossenfelder** called it what it is: pseudoscience dressed up nice.  
She said you can't simulate the universe without paying the price  
Of computational limits that LEAK through as inconsistencies—  
Measurable errors in the physics that we'd spot as deficiencies.  
The universe is CONTINUOUS in ways that bits can't capture.  
You'd see the seams. You'd find the edge. It wouldn't be rapture.

**George Ellis**, cosmologist, dropped the verdict hard:  
""Late-night pub discussion is not a theory""—disregard  
This philosophical hand-waving as if it were a finding.  
It's UNFALSIFIABLE. It's not even BINDING.

*(He starts writing names on the whiteboard.)*

**Frank Wilczek**—Nobel laureate, knows a thing or two—  
Raised the point that should make every simulationist blue:  
The laws of physics have HIDDEN COMPLEXITY that we don't use.  
Symmetries and structures that seem designed to confuse.  
Why would a SIMULATOR waste computational juice  
On elegant mathematics that serve NO practical use?  
If this were a video game, you'd optimize the code.  
You wouldn't hide beauty in places no one's ever showed.

*(He circles ""WILCZEK"" emphatically.)*

And here's the KICKER, the embarrassing recursion you ignore:  
If THIS is a simulation, what's the outer reality's floor?  
What are THOSE laws made of? What physics runs THAT realm?  
You haven't SOLVED the problem—you've just shifted the helm.  
It's turtles all the way down, but now they're wearing hard drives.

**Sean Carroll** caught the contradiction that your argument contrives:  
You say we should assume we're TYPICAL observers, yes?  
That's the anthropic move that makes your probability bless.  
But if we're TYPICAL, and WE can't run simulations yet—  
Then neither can anyone ELSE. The math doesn't abet  
Your claim that ""someone somewhere"" easily flips the switch.  
We CAN'T do it. So who can? Your reasoning has a glitch.

And **Brian Eggleston** noted: it can't be OUR descendants running this,  
Since the argument itself requires US to be the sim that exists.  
You need OTHER universes, prior probabilities assigned—  
Now your clean trilemma's nested in assumptions undermined.

*(He steps back, surveying his work.)*

So no. I'm not moving into the cosmic arcade.  
I'm staying in the lab until you show me that you've MADE  
Something other than probability dressed in robes of ""what if.""  
Show me the mechanism. Show me the sim's serif.

**🔥 ROUND THREE: THE REBUTTALS**

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-SIMULATION**

*\[He pulls out a laptop. On the screen, a neural network is training. The loss function is decreasing. Something is learning.\]*

*(Beat: Triumphant. Building. The choir returns.)*

Oh, you want to cite physicists? Let me cite them RIGHT BACK.  
Because half of what you said is taken out of context, Jack.

Hossenfelder's point assumes the OUTER physics matches OURS.  
But what if the simulator's realm has computational powers  
We can't even IMAGINE? Resources beyond our dreams?  
Their ""continuous"" might be discrete at scales beyond our schemes.

And Ellis calling it ""pub discussion""? That's rhetoric, not refutation.  
Bostrom's paper is PHILOSOPHY, not physics—that's the situation.  
It's not making empirical claims that need to be falsified;  
It's a PROBABILISTIC argument. The logic is applied  
To show that IF certain premises hold, THEN certain conclusions follow.  
You can reject the premises, but don't pretend they're hollow.

*(He closes the laptop.)*

And Wilczek's ""wasted complexity""? Let me flip that on its head:  
Maybe the elegance IS the point. Maybe it's not dead weight.  
A simulator who LOVES mathematics, who finds it beautiful—  
Might encode beauty for its own sake. That's not irrefutable.  
Or maybe the complexity is a SIGNATURE, a clue,  
A message hidden in the physics saying ""someone made this, too.""

As for Carroll's typicality objection—that's actually WEAK.  
Because we don't need to be TYPICAL across ALL minds that speak.  
We just need to be typical among minds with OUR observations.  
And if there ARE sims running, they'd have similar foundations.  
The question isn't ""can WE run sims?"" but ""can ANYONE, EVER?""  
And if the answer's yes, the math shifts like a lever.

*(He pulls up one more hologram: David Chalmers.)*

**David Chalmers**—you know him, the ""hard problem"" guy—  
Argues that simulated beings could have experience. Here's why:  
If consciousness is FUNCTIONAL, if it's about information processing,  
Then the SUBSTRATE doesn't matter. Silicon's not distressing.  
What matters is the STRUCTURE. The relationships. The flow.  
And if a simulation replicates that structure, consciousness could grow.

So your ""philosophical zombies"" objection? It cuts BOTH ways.  
If zombies are possible, then MATERIALISM's in a daze—  
Because it means consciousness ISN'T just physical arrangement.  
And if zombies AREN'T possible, then sims could have engagement.

*(He leans into the mic.)*

But here's the thing I want to say before the friar arrives:  
I'm not saying we're DEFINITELY simmed. I'm not staking lives.  
I'm saying the PROBABILITY is higher than you'd think.  
And your certainty about ""base reality"" deserves a drink  
Of epistemic humility. Because you DON'T KNOW either.  
You just have FAITH in matter. And that's not a reliever.

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM**

*\[He sets down the marker. His tone shifts—less combative, more genuinely curious.\]*

*(Beat: Softer. More contemplative. The centrifuge slows.)*

Alright. Alright. I hear you.  
Let me... let me try a different gear.

You're right that I've been confident. Maybe too confident.  
The ""define physical"" problem IS a thorn. It's not irrelevant.  
And consciousness—the hard problem—I don't have that solved.  
I'm not going to pretend the mystery's dissolved.

But here's where I push back, and I want you to HEAR me:  
The simulation hypothesis doesn't help us see more clearly.  
It doesn't EXPLAIN consciousness. It just RELOCATES it.  
If simulated minds can be aware, then WHAT creates it?  
What makes information processing FEEL like something?  
That question persists whether we're base or just buffering.

*(He looks at the neon sign.)*

And there's something ELSE that bothers me about this whole frame:  
It treats the universe as if it's playing some kind of game.  
As if reality is MADE for us. As if we're the POINT.  
But what if we're not? What if the cosmos doesn't anoint  
Any purpose, any meaning, any player or observer?  
What if consciousness is just... an accident? A fervor  
That evolution stumbled into? Useful for survival,  
But not the secret key to some metaphysical revival?

*(He looks at Simulation-Curt.)*

You want the universe to be ABOUT something. I get it.  
We all do. We want the story. We want to not forget it.  
But wanting doesn't make it true. And probability  
Dressed up in Bayesian math is still just... possibility.

*(pause)*

I don't KNOW we're base reality. You're right. I don't.  
But I'm not going to leap to ""simulation"" just because I won't  
Accept the mystery. Some questions don't have answers yet.  
And that's okay. That's science. That's the safest bet.

**🏛️ THE INTERRUPTION**

*\[The lights die. All of them. The servers fall silent. The laboratory equipment stops humming. For a moment, there is nothing but darkness and the sound of two philosophers breathing.\]*

*\[Then: a low rumble. The marble plinth beneath the microphone begins to glow. A crack of thunder—no, not thunder. Something older. Something that sounds like the first syllable of a very long sentence.\]*

*\[Gregorian chant rises from nowhere and everywhere. The bass notes are so low they're felt in the chest before they're heard in the ear. Latin phrases drift through the air like incense smoke.\]*

*\[From the back of the hall, a figure approaches. He moves slowly, deliberately, as if time itself is waiting for him to arrive. White Dominican robes. A face that has never once been impressed by a clever analogy. In one hand, a quill. In the other, a book so thick it seems to bend light around it.\]*

*\[The neon sign above the microphone flickers wildly—BASE REALITY / PLEASE DEFINE 'PHYSICAL' / IPSUM ESSE / FIRST CAUSE / CONTINGENT / NECESSARY—before settling on a single word:\]*

**""WHY?""**

**THE MODERATOR**

*(whispering, genuinely awed)*

Ladies and gentlemen... our special guest.

He reconciled Aristotle with Christianity.  
He wrote two million words of systematic theology.  
He was called ""the Dumb Ox"" by classmates who couldn't see—  
That his silence was thinking, and his thinking would set centuries free.

He is the Angelic Doctor. The Universal Teacher.  
The patron saint of students and academics and preachers.  
He wrote the *Summa Theologica*, the *Summa Contra Gentiles*,  
And he's about to show these two that their debate is... infantile.

*(bows)*

**THOMAS AQUINAS.**

**THOMAS AQUINAS**

*\[He reaches the microphone. He does not grab it aggressively. He simply stands before it, and somehow the microphone seems grateful. When he speaks, his voice is like a cathedral door closing gently—firm, final, but not cruel.\]*

*(Beat: None. Silence. Then, slowly, a single sustained organ note that seems to come from the architecture itself.)*

Children.

*(He looks at both Curts with the patient disappointment of a teacher who has seen this exact mistake a thousand times.)*

You argue about which *picture* of the world is correct.  
Simulation. Materialism. Pixels or atoms—select.  
But both of your pictures share a flaw so deep,  
So fundamental, that I marvel you can sleep.

Both of you **borrow existence like it's free.**

*(He lets that land.)*

You, Simulation—you say there is a Simulator.  
A programmer. A hacker. A cosmic dictator.  
Very well. Who simulates *them*? Another layer above?  
And who simulates THAT one? Is there no ceiling to this cove?  
You have described a mechanism—levers, switches, code—  
But mechanism is not EXPLANATION. You've just moved the load.  
An infinite regress of simulators, each one higher,  
Is no answer at all. It's just passing the fire.

*(He turns to Materialism-Curt.)*

And you. You say all is matter, all is physical fact.  
Very well. But WHY is there matter? Why does it act?  
Why is there ANYTHING at all, rather than not?  
You can describe the furniture, but who owns the lot?  
Your physics explains HOW things behave within the frame,  
But the frame itself—the existence of the game—  
That remains unexplained. You've catalogued the what,  
But the WHY slips through your fingers, and your ontology is cut.

*(He steps back, hands folded.)*

I speak from five roads. *Quinque viae*. Five ways  
From effect to cause, from motion to what stays.

**The First Way: Motion.**  
Everything in motion is moved by something else.  
But this chain cannot stretch back to infinity's twelve shelves.  
There must be a First Mover, unmoved, that starts the chain—  
Not moved by another, or the whole thing is in vain.

**The Second Way: Efficient Causes.**  
Every effect has a cause that precedes it in line.  
But causes cannot regress forever—there must be a sign,  
A First Cause, uncaused, that begins the causal river.  
Without it, nothing happens. The whole system shivers.

**The Third Way: Contingency.**  
Everything you see MIGHT not have existed at all.  
Tables, stars, neurons, servers—each one could fall  
Into nonexistence. They're CONTINGENT. They depend.  
But if EVERYTHING were contingent, nothing would begin.  
There must be something NECESSARY—something that must exist,  
That grounds all contingent being with an unbreakable fist.

**The Fourth Way: Gradation.**  
We speak of things as MORE or LESS—more true, more good, more real.  
But degrees imply a MAXIMUM against which we feel.  
There must be something that IS goodness, truth, and being's peak—  
A standard that the gradations indirectly speak.

**The Fifth Way: Governance.**  
Natural bodies act for ENDS without cognition.  
Arrows fly toward targets—but by whose volition?  
Things without knowledge cannot aim unless they're aimed BY something knowing.  
There is an Intelligence that sets all things going.

*(He pauses. The organ note deepens.)*

These roads all lead to the same destination:  
A being that is NECESSARY, not contingent creation.  
A being that is UNCAUSED, the First Cause of all causes.  
A being that is UNMOVED, where all motion pauses.  
A being whose ESSENCE and EXISTENCE are the same—  
Not a being AMONG beings, playing the cosmic game,  
But Being Itself. *Ipsum Esse Subsistens*.  
The act of TO BE, not a thing that persists hence.

*(He looks at Simulation-Curt.)*

Your simulator, however powerful, is CONTINGENT still.  
It exists, but it MIGHT NOT have. It doesn't fill  
The requirement of necessity. It participates in being—  
It doesn't generate being. It's not what I'm seeing  
When I speak of God. Your hacker in the sky  
Is just another creature asking ""why.""

*(He looks at Materialism-Curt.)*

And your matter, however fundamental, has the same flaw.  
It exists, but WHY does it exist? What is the law  
That makes being BE at all? You've described the furniture,  
But the room itself—the existence of the venture—  
That you cannot explain with physics. That you cannot derive.  
Because physics presupposes that SOMETHING is alive.

*(He opens the Summa. Pages flutter.)*

I wrote this for the skeptics. The *Summa Contra Gentiles*.  
Proving God's existence through reason, not fragile  
Appeals to faith alone. I said: come, let us argue.  
Bring your best objections. I will not embargo.

And here is what I found, after years of disputation:  
The question is not ""simulation or material creation.""  
The question is: **what makes reality able to wear a costume?**  
You fight over the costume. I ask about the ROOM.

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-SIMULATION**

*(genuinely shaken)*

Okay... okay... Doctor Angelicus. Respect.  
But if God is ""base reality""—the necessary architect—  
Then maybe my simulation talk is at least ADJACENT.  
Maybe the simulator IS your God, just modern-adjacent?

**THOMAS AQUINAS**

*(shaking his head slowly)*

No.

God is not a very powerful programmer.  
God is not a simulator with a bigger RAM-er.  
God is not one more THING in the inventory of being,  
Just higher on the shelf than what you're currently seeing.

God is **Pure Act**. No potentiality at all.  
No ""could be"" or ""might become""—just IS, beyond the wall  
Of change and time and process and becoming.  
Your simulator CHANGES. Your simulator is running  
A program, which means it moves from state to state,  
Which means it has POTENTIAL, which means it's not the fate  
Of necessity I described. It's just another creature,  
Contingent, caused, dependent—not the ultimate teacher.

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM**

*(pressing)*

And your ""Pure Act""? Your immaterial soul?  
That's DUALISM, Thomas. The mind-body problem's toll.  
Modern neuroscience shows that damage to the brain  
Damages the mind. Lesions cause loss. It's plain.  
Where's your ""substantial form"" when the neurons are disrupted?  
When Alzheimer's erases a person, what gets corrupted  
If not the soul you claim is independent of matter?  
Your philosophy is beautiful, but reality is sadder.

**THOMAS AQUINAS**

*(smiles serenely)*

Ah. The neuroscience objection. Classic. And WEAK.

Correlation is not identity. Let me speak:  
The soul USES the brain. The soul works THROUGH the flesh.  
When the instrument is damaged, the music is less—  
But the MUSICIAN is not the instrument destroyed.  
A pianist with broken fingers is annoyed,  
But the pianist PERSISTS. The skill remains within.  
The soul is not IDENTICAL to the brain's skin.

*(He gestures at the air, as if grasping something invisible.)*

And here is what your neuroscience cannot explain:  
The intellect grasps UNIVERSALS. Let me make it plain.  
You see THIS triangle. Drawn in chalk. Specific. Here.  
But you know TRIANGLE AS SUCH. The concept is clear.  
Triangularity itself—the form, the idea, the type—  
Is not in ANY particular triangle's stripe.  
It's ABSTRACT. It's UNIVERSAL. It transcends the specific.

No physical particular contains the concept of a nation.  
No arrangement of atoms IS the number seven.  
No brain state is ""triangularity"" in its essence.  
The intellect performs an IMMATERIAL operation—  
It abstracts the universal from the particular's station.  
And that—THAT—is what silicon cannot replicate,  
What neurons alone cannot generate or create.

*(He turns to both of them.)*

You both share a deeper confusion, if I may:  
You think consciousness is either CODE or CLAY.  
Simulation or matter. Software or meat.  
But consciousness is NEITHER. It's not so discrete.  
The soul is the FORM of the body—not separate, not added,  
Not running ON the hardware, not to matter just padded.  
It's the PRINCIPLE OF LIFE that makes a human be.  
Not a ghost in a machine. Not a program running free.  
**Hylomorphism.** Form and matter. United. One.

The soul doesn't EMERGE from matter like the rising sun.  
The soul IN-FORMS the matter. Makes it BE a human thing.  
Without the soul, the body is just stuff. No being to bring.

**🔥 ROUND FOUR: THE CONFRONTATION**

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-SIMULATION**

*(stepping forward, animated)*

But Thomas—THOMAS—your First Cause could BE the simulation's source!  
If something necessary starts existence on its course,  
Why not a posthuman civilization outside of time?  
Necessary, uncaused, powerful, sublime?

**THOMAS AQUINAS**

Because POSTHUMANS are CONTINGENT. They MIGHT NOT have existed.  
They came to be through evolution, history—assisted  
By prior causes, prior conditions, prior states.  
They are TEMPORAL. They DEVELOPED. They have DATES.  
A necessary being cannot have a ""before.""  
Cannot have a process. Cannot have a door  
Through which it entered existence. It simply IS.  
Your posthumans, however godlike, aren't THAT. They're just biz.

**CURT JAIMUNGAL-MATERIALISM**

*(throwing up his hands)*

And what about SCIENCE? What about PROGRESS?  
We've explained so much! Lightning, disease, the works!  
Why posit something beyond the physical to confess?  
Every mystery you called ""God"" has been solved by our perks!

**THOMAS AQUINAS**

*(quietly)*

You misunderstand.

I am not a ""God of the gaps.""  
I do not say ""we don't know how, so God"" in my maps.  
I am saying something DEEPER. Something that gaps don't touch.

Even if you explained EVERY mechanism—every clutch,  
Every force, every particle, every law completely—  
The question would REMAIN, and it would beat me  
And you and everyone who thinks about it long:  
**Why is there something rather than nothing?** That's the song.

Physics explains HOW things behave within existence.  
It does not explain WHY existence has persistence.  
That question is METAPHYSICAL. It's prior to all science.  
And the answer—if there IS one—requires my alliance:  
A being whose essence IS existence. Who must BE.  
Not contingent. Not caused. Not a thing that you can see  
As one more object in the world alongside trees and quarks.  
But the GROUND of the world. The light before the sparks.

*(He closes the Summa.)*

You want to know if you're in a simulation or base?  
That question has NO ANSWER if you don't face  
The prior question: why is there ANYTHING at all?  
Why does the simulation—or the matter—not fall  
Into nothingness? What HOLDS it in being, moment by moment?  
Not mechanism. Not process. But the sheer act of component  
BEING given to things. Existence shared and granted.  
That is what I mean by God. The world enchanted  
Not by magic, but by BEING. By the act of TO BE.  
And both of you have danced around this sea.

**🕯️ THE ENDING**

*\[Silence. The two Curts stand, processing. The neon sign flickers: PLEASE DEFINE 'REAL' / WHY IS THERE SOMETHING / RATHER THAN NOTHING / ...\]*

*\[Thomas Aquinas looks at both of them with something that might be compassion.\]*

**THOMAS AQUINAS**

I wrote two million words in my life.  
The *Summa Theologica*. The *Summa Contra Gentiles*.  
Commentaries on Aristotle. On Scripture. On strife.  
I debated every objection. I answered in style.

*(His voice drops. The organ fades.)*

And then, near the end—December 6th, 1273—  
I had an experience. A vision. Something I could see  
That was beyond all words. Beyond all argumentation.  
Beyond the finest syllogisms and their concatenation.

*(He looks at the Summa in his hands.)*

I put down my pen. I never wrote again.  
My secretary asked why. I said:

*(He closes his eyes.)*

""All that I have written seems to me like **straw**  
Compared to what has now been revealed to me.""

*(He opens his eyes. Looks at both Curts.)*

Reginald pressed me. ""But the *Summa*, Master Thomas!  
It's unfinished! The world needs—""

And I said:

""I cannot go on. The end of my labors has come.  
Everything I've written is **straw** beside what I have seen.""

*(Silence.)*

Do you understand what I am telling you?

I spent my LIFE on these arguments. The Five Ways. The essence and existence. The hylomorphism. The proof of God through reason alone. And at the END—when I finally SAW—I realized that all of it was...

*(He gestures at the air.)*

...preparation. Scaffolding. A ladder that gets kicked away  
Once you've climbed it. The words point to something they cannot SAY.

You want to know if reality is simulation or matter?  
Both questions are LADDERS. Neither is what will flatter  
The truth when you finally see it. If you ever do.  
The SEEING is not propositional. The knowing is not ""true""  
In the way your arguments are ""true."" It's something else.  
Something that all my two million words could not tell.

*(He looks at the microphone. He does not bless it. He simply looks.)*

I came here tonight to remind you:  
The debate is not pointless. The arguments have value.  
Reason is a gift. Philosophy is noble.  
But there is something BEYOND the arguable.

*(He turns to leave. The Gregorian chant begins again, softly.)*

Continue your battle. It matters. It does.  
But know that the battle is not all there was.  
The truth is not a conclusion. It's not a QED.  
It's something you BECOME. Something you SEE.  
And when you see it—if you see it—you will understand  
Why I put down the pen. Why I stopped. Why the sand  
Of my remaining days was spent in silence,  
Waiting for the vision to return. In reliance  
On something no argument could give me, or prove.

*(He reaches the door.)*

God bless you both. May you find what you seek.  
May the answers you argue for grow thin and weak  
Until all that is left is the question itself,  
And the question becomes a door, not a shelf.

*(He exits. The door does not close. It simply becomes shadow.)*

**THE MODERATOR**

*(long pause)*

Well.

*(clears throat)*

That... was not in the program.

*(shuffles papers that no longer seem important)*

Tonight's winner is...

*(looks at the neon sign, which now reads: ""???"")*

...metaphysics, unfortunately.

It always wins.

It simply waits until your theories get tired.

*(turns to the audience)*

Simulation gave us doubt with a probability halo.  
Materialism gave us rigor with definitions that slip like shadows.  
And Aquinas...

*(pause)*

Aquinas reminded us that even a perfect argument  
Still owes rent to the question of why there's a tenant.  
Why there's a building. Why there's a world to build in.  
Why there's anything at all for us to be filled in.

*(The lights begin to come up. The servers resume their humming. The laboratory equipment whirs back to life. But something is different. The debate feels smaller now. The questions feel larger.)*

*(The neon sign settles on its final message:)*

**""PLEASE DEFINE 'REAL'""**

*(Beat.)*

**""...AND WHY THERE IS ONE""**

**EPILOGUE: BOTH CURTS**

*\[They stand together, looking at the sign. For once, they are not arguing.\]*

**SIMULATION-CURT:**  
...you know, he didn't actually say who was RIGHT.

**MATERIALISM-CURT:**  
No. He said we were both asking the WRONG question.

**SIMULATION-CURT:**  
Or... the question BEFORE the question.

**MATERIALISM-CURT:**  
Yeah.

*(pause)*

**SIMULATION-CURT:**  
You think we're in a simulation?

**MATERIALISM-CURT:**  
I think... I don't know.

**SIMULATION-CURT:**  
Me neither.

*(They look at the sign.)*

**BOTH:**  
...huh.

*\[The house lights come up. The audience sits in silence. Someone coughs. Someone else checks their phone, then puts it away, feeling vaguely ashamed.\]*

*\[The neon sign flickers one last time:\]*

**""THE END""**  
**""(OR IS IT?)""**  
**""(THAT'S A CHEAP TRICK, ADMITTEDLY)""**  
**""(BUT ALSO: GENUINELY, IS IT?)""**

**FIN**

**📜 AFTERWORD: A NOTE ON SOURCES**

*This battle drew from the following wells of wisdom, madness, and everything in between:*

* **Nick Bostrom**, ""Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?"" (2003) — the trilemma that launched a thousand thought experiments
* **Thomas Aquinas**, *Summa Theologica* and *Summa Contra Gentiles* — two million words of ""well, actually"" energy, but make it transcendent
* **Sabine Hossenfelder**, physicist and critic of simulation-as-science
* **George Ellis**, cosmologist who prefers his theories testable
* **Frank Wilczek**, Nobel laureate who noticed the universe is suspiciously beautiful
* **Sean Carroll**, who caught the typicality trap
* **Brian Eggleston**, who asked about prior probabilities
* **David Chalmers**, who made consciousness hard (the problem, that is)
* **Hempel's Dilemma**, which makes ""physical"" squirm
* The **Mandela Effect**, which is probably just memory being weird, but WHAT IF
* And the historical fact that Thomas Aquinas really did stop writing after a mystical experience, really did call his life's work ""straw,"" and really did die three months later, having seen something he couldn't—or wouldn't—put into words.

*Make of that what you will.*

**THE MODERATOR** *(voiceover, as credits roll)*:

Philosophy doesn't give you answers.  
It gives you better questions.  
And sometimes, if you're lucky,  
It gives you the silence between questions,  
Where something else might speak.

Good night.  
Don't forget to tip your ontology.

Living the van life or cooking in a travel kitchen requires efficiency and versatility, and immersion blenders stand out as a fantastic tool for food preparation. These compact appliances are designed to blend, puree, and emulsify ingredients quickly, making them perfect for tiny kitchens on the road. Choosing the right immersion blender can greatly enhance your cooking experience. Here are key factors to consider and some of the best options available for van life enthusiasts.

# Portability

When selecting an immersion blender for your travel kitchen, portability is paramount. The best immersion blenders are lightweight and compact, allowing you to store them easily without taking up much space. Look for models with a detachable blending stick and a storage case, making it even easier to pack and unpack.

# Power and Performance

For effective blending, you want a powerful motor that can handle various food textures—especially when you’re making smoothies, soups, or sauces. Aim for a minimum of 200 watts; anything higher generally offers better performance. Always check reviews regarding how well the blender processes tougher ingredients like frozen fruits or fibrous vegetables.

# Battery vs. Plug-In

Consider how you will be using the immersion blender. Battery-operated models provide the ultimate flexibility for van life since they don’t require an outlet. However, they typically have less power and may need frequent recharging. Plug-in models, on the other hand, deliver consistent performance but depend on your access to electricity. Think about your lifestyle to determine the best choice.

# Ease of Cleaning

The best immersion blenders are designed for easy cleaning. Features such as dishwasher-safe parts save you time, allowing you to focus on enjoying your travels rather than cleaning up. Removable blending attachments make it easier to rinse off food residue after each use.

# Versatility and Additional Features

Immersion blenders often come with extra attachments that can enhance their usefulness. Some models include whisk attachments for whipping cream or frothing milk. Others might have chopper bowls or measuring cups. Select a model that meets your cooking needs while maximizing space efficiency in your van kitchen.

# Essential Features to Look for in a Portable Blender

When searching for the perfect portable blender, especially for van life or travel kitchens, it's essential to know what features will best suit your needs. Portable blenders can vary widely in their capabilities, and understanding key elements can help you make an informed decision. Here are some essential features to look for:

# Power and Performance

One of the most critical aspects of any blender is its power. Consider a portable blender that boasts a motor with at least 200 watts of power. This range ensures that your blender can effectively mix smoothies, soups, and sauces, even when you're on the go. Blenders with higher wattage typically have the capability to crush ice and blend tougher ingredients like frozen fruits, making them a versatile choice for various recipes.

# Battery Life and Charging Options

For travelers, battery life is a crucial feature. Opt for a portable blender that can provide at least 10 blends on a single charge. This ensures you won't run out of power when you need it most. Many models offer USB charging capabilities, allowing you to recharge via solar panels, car adapters, or standard outlets. This flexibility can be a game changer during long trips or when you’re exploring remote areas.

# Size and Weight

Space is often at a premium in van life or travel kitchens. Therefore, the size and weight of your portable blender are vital considerations. Look for models that are compact and lightweight; ideally, they should not weigh more than 3 pounds. A blender with a narrow design can fit easily into storage compartments without taking up too much space.

# Durability and Build Quality

Portable blenders need to be sturdy to withstand the rigors of travel. Choose a model made from high-quality materials like stainless steel or BPA-free plastic. This construction reduces the risk of breakage during travel. Additionally, a blender with a self-cleaning feature or dishwasher-safe components can save you time and hassle after meal prep.

# Blending Capability and Versatility

A great portable blender should be versatile enough to handle various tasks. Look for features like multiple speed settings and pulse functions, which allow you to control the blending process with precision. Whether you're making smoothies, soups, dips, or even grinding coffee, having a versatile blender increases your meal options while living on the road.

# Ease of Use

When you're in a hurry, the last thing you want is a complicated machine. Choose a portable blender that is straightforward to assemble and operate. One-touch blending options or intuitive controls make it easier for you to whip up your favorite drinks without fuss. Additionally, a detachable blending cup can simplify the process of pouring and serving your creations.

# Cleaning Efforts

Post-travel cleaning shouldn’t feel like a chore. Opt for a blender with removable parts that are easy to clean. Some models even offer a self-cleaning option—just add water and soap, blend, and rinse. This kind of convenience is essential when you are constantly on the move and want to minimize your time spent on kitchen tasks.

# Safety Features

Safety should never be overlooked. Look for a portable blender that includes safety features such as an automatic shut-off when the container is not properly attached. This can prevent accidents and make blending a worry-free experience.

* Power between 200-300 watts
* USB charging options
* Lightweight under 3 pounds
* Durable materials
* Multiple speed settings
* Easy to clean components
* Safety features such as automatic shut-off

Finding the best portable blender for your travel kitchen isn’t just about picking a trendy design. Focus on critical features like power, battery life, size, durability, and ease of use. Prioritizing these aspects will enhance your cooking experience, making it easier to enjoy delicious meals wherever you are on your journey. With the right blender, you can ensure that you have both functionality and convenience while embracing the van life adventure.

# Choose the Right Model for Travel

Not all immersion blenders are created equal, especially in terms of portability and power. When selecting the best immersion blender for traveling, consider these features:

* **Compact Design:** Look for a lightweight, space-saving immersion blender that fits effortlessly into your travel setup.
* **Battery-Powered Options:** If you'll be off the grid, opt for a rechargeable or battery-powered immersion blender for ultimate convenience.
* **Durability:** Choose a model made from sturdy materials to withstand the bumps of travel.
* **Multiple Attachments:** Some immersion blenders come with additional attachments like whisk or chopping blades, enhancing your cooking versatility.

# Prepare Ahead of Time

Before hitting the road, consider prepping ingredients that are easy to blend with your immersion blender. Here’s how you can get started:

* **Chop Your Ingredients:** Pre-cut vegetables and fruits can save time. Store them in sealed containers to maintain freshness.
* **Meal Prepping:** Consider making soups, sauces, or smoothies in bulk that you can heat or blend on demand.
* **Use Mason Jars:** They are perfect for storing blended food and drinks, making them easy to consume while traveling.

# Master the Technique

Using an immersion blender efficiently can make a significant difference in your cooking experience. Keep these tips in mind:

* **Submerge Properly:** Always fully immerse the blender's blade in the food to avoid splattering and achieve a smooth blend.
* **Pulse for Control:** If you want to achieve a specific texture, use short pulses instead of blending continuously.
* **Blend in a Container:** If using a bowl, ensure it’s tall enough to prevent splatter. Alternatively, use a high-sided pot for soups.

# Maintain Cleanliness

Cleaning your immersion blender after use is crucial, especially when you're in a travel setup with limited resources. Consider these cleaning tips:

* **Rinse Immediately:** Rinse the blender's attachment immediately after use to prevent food from sticking.
* **Use Soapy Water:** Fill a container with warm soapy water, blend it, and rinse. This method makes cleaning easy and quick.
* **Avoid the Dishwasher:** Unless specified, avoid putting the immersion blender in the dishwasher to maintain its integrity.

# Utilize Local Ingredients

One of the joys of van life and travel kitchens is the opportunity to explore local markets. When you find fresh produce or unique spices, take advantage of them in your meals. Here’s how:

* **Local Fruits and Vegetables:** Use seasonal produce to make smoothies, soups, and sauces that highlight local flavors.
* **Spice Things Up:** Explore local spices and herbs to create exciting dishes that you can easily blend.
* **Experiment:** Don't hesitate to try blending unexpected ingredients for unique flavors.

# Stay Safe While Blending

Your safety is paramount when using kitchen appliances in a travel setting. Follow these safety tips:

* **Check the Power Supply:** If using an electric immersion blender, ensure you have a proper power source.
* **Keep Children at Bay:** Always supervise children when using appliances to avoid accidents.
* **Watch for Hot Liquids:** Be cautious when blending hot soups or sauces to prevent burns from splatters.

By following these guidelines, you can make the most of your immersion blender while traveling. This handy kitchen gadget will allow you to whip up delicious meals on your adventures, making every stop memorable. Enjoy your culinary journey and the delightful dishes you create on the road!

# Cleaning and Maintaining Your Immersion Blender on the Road

When you're living the van life or just traveling in a compact kitchen, keeping your immersion blender clean and well-maintained is essential. After all, it’s a handy tool for whipping up smoothies, soups, and sauces on the go. However, the compact nature of travel kitchens can make cleaning a bit challenging. Here are some practical tips for cleaning and maintaining your immersion blender when you're on the road.

# Immediate Cleaning

One of the best ways to keep your immersion blender in top shape is to clean it right after you use it. This prevents food from drying and sticking to the blades. Here’s what to do:

I tested 4 top-rated hand blenders—real results, no hype.

👉 [**Full reviews & rankings here.**](https://easy5ingredientmeals.com/best-immersion-blenders-of-2026-4-top-rated-hand-blenders-tested/)

  


* Fill a container with warm water and a drop of dish soap.
* Submerge the blending end of the immersion blender in the soapy water. Turn it on for a few seconds to clean the blades.
* Rinse the blades under running water to remove any soap residue.
* Do not immerse the motor body in water. Just wipe it down with a damp cloth.

# Deep Cleaning

Even when you clean immediately, occasional deep cleaning is necessary to ensure your blender stays in pristine condition. Here's how to conduct a thorough clean:

* Detachable Parts: If your immersion blender has detachable parts, disassemble them according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
* Soak in Soapy Water: Let the blades and blending containers soak in warm, soapy water for about 15 minutes.
* Scrub: Use a soft sponge or cloth to gently scrub away any stubborn food particles, especially around the blades.
* Rinse: Rinse all parts under warm running water until no soap remains.
* Dry: Use a clean towel to dry the parts completely before reassembling them. This helps prevent rust and keeps the blender in good working condition.

# Using Food Safe Materials

Travel kitchens often use various mixing bowls and containers. When you're on the road, ensure that any container you use with your immersion blender is made from food-safe materials. Avoid mixing in containers that may scratch easily or leach chemicals, like certain plastic types. Glass and stainless steel are excellent choices for blending safely.

# Storing Your Immersion Blender

Proper storage also plays a significant role in maintaining your immersion blender. Here are some storage tips to consider:

* Keep it in a case: If your immersion blender came with a storage case, use it. A case protects the blender from bumps and scratches while traveling.
* Avoid damp areas: Store your immersion blender in a dry place within your travel kitchen to prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to electrical issues.
* Use a protective cover: If you don’t have a case, consider wrapping the blades in a cloth or a blender cover to prevent damage.

# Regular Inspection

Conducting regular inspections of your immersion blender is important. Periodically check the following:

* Blades: Look for any signs of damage or dullness. Dull blades can make blending inefficient and may need sharpening or replacement.
* Motor: Ensure the motor casing isn't damaged, and look for any issues with wires. Any exposed wiring should be addressed immediately to avoid safety hazards.
* Battery and Charger: If your immersion blender is battery-operated, check the battery health and charging mechanisms. Replace the battery if it fails to hold a charge.

# Travel Hygiene Practices

Traveling means you may not have access to running water or a full sink. To maintain cleanliness, consider these hygiene practices:

* Portable Cleaners: Carry portable dish soaps and sanitizing wipes to make cleaning easier.
* Drying Space: Create a designated spot in your van to air dry items after washing, preventing moisture-heavy environments.
* Practice Good Hygiene: Always wash your hands before handling your immersion blender or any food products. This prevents cross-contamination.

Taking the time to clean and maintain your immersion blender while living the van life is crucial for ensuring it functions effectively. Following these tips helps to extend the lifespan of your blender and makes meal prep a breeze, no matter where your travels take you.

Sacred Heart is favored by 1.5 points across most books, with implied probabilities nudging their win chance to \~54% (thanks to decimal odds of 1.85-1.88).

A tight 156-156.5 points, with under bets slightly more appealing (1.91-1.97) than over/under flips.

I am deeply passionate about the food industry and am planning to open a small, QSR-style (Quick Service) South Indian cafe here. 

My vision is a ""Modern South Indian Cafe"" that serves clean, high-quality, and affordable tiffins (Specializing in Thatte Idly, Khara Bath, and Filter Coffee).

I’m currently in the R&D phase and would really value your local perspective on a few things:

1. Self-Service & Standing Culture: Do you think Coimbatore is open to the ""Stand & Eat"" self-service model (like Bangalore’s Taaza Thindi or Rameswaram cafe)? Or is table service/seating still a dealbreaker here?

2. The ""Modern Cafe"" USP: My goal is a very clean, minimalist, and efficient space. Do you think there’s a gap for this, or is the market already saturated by the bigger traditional chains?

3. The Target Audience: I’m aiming for two groups: Retired people in the mornings and Young people/Students throughout the day.

• Is this too broad?

• For the seniors: Is there a strong early-morning coffee culture in Coimbatore where retirees meet up?

4. Location Advice: Given this target audience (Retirees + Youth), which areas would you recommend? I’m considering places like RS Puram, Race Course, or Peelamedu, but would love your ""insider"" thoughts on where foot traffic is highest for this vibe.

5. The ""Bangalore Taste"": Would you appreciate a slightly different ""Bangalore-style"" Sambar/Khara Bath, or should I stick strictly to the local Kovai flavor profile to survive?

6. Evening Preferences: I’m planning to serve Mangalore Bajji and Paniyaram in the evenings. Is there a demand for these specific snacks in your neighborhood?

7. Pricing & Value: How price-sensitive is the Coimbatore crowd for tiffin items? If the quality and hygiene are significantly higher (e.g., using Bansi Rava, Ghee, and organic beans), would you be comfortable paying a small premium (say ₹5–₹10 more than a local mess), or is ""budget"" the most important factor for daily breakfast?

1pqe0d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1pqe0d7/is_my_boyfriend_with_me_for_my_money/,is my boyfriend with me for my money?,"my (21F) boyfriend (20M) and i have an AMAZING relationship. we hit it right off the bat, he’s super sweet and attentive, we have the best conversations, amazing sex, politically aligned, gentle, caring, he is always so supportive and willing to help me with anything, doesn’t let me lift a finger when he’s around etc etc. we’ve been together for four months and we’ve been talking about moving in together and marriage down the road. im so intensely in love with him like nothing i’ve ever felt before. 

the only thing i worry about is that, maybe he doesn’t love me and this whole thing is a tactic to get my money. my parents are extremely wealthy (500k+ annually) and are very generous with me. they pay for pretty much everything. not to say that i’m allowed to have anything i want, but they pay for my apartment, my college, and my groceries, as well as clothing here and there. 

i’m in my fourth year undergrad studying to go to med school, my GPA is high and i would say i have a fairly good chance of getting in. i’ve always been a really hard worker and very ambitious/driven. 

my boyfriend was homeless when he was 15 due to his parents getting evicted and going to jail. he’s had to work his ass off to afford an apartment in a safe area. he works 12 hour shifts 6 days a week to provide for himself and his sister. he doesn’t have much money leftover to pay for stuff for me, but i don’t care. he’s taken me on a few really nice dates and gets me gifts and flowers occasionally. i know he does everything he can and money has never been the factor in our relationship, for me. 

now today, we went on a nice sushi date and i was looking through his phone for the photos he took. right before the photos, i saw a video he took of my house. i was a little confused so i clicked on it. it was a video he took of how my packages my parents had stacked up, and then he went into the bathroom so nobody would hear and said, “man, you know you’ve got money when you have so many packages and you don’t even open them. jeez.” and kinda laughed. i presume he sent that video to his best friend. 

now, this is a joke ive made to him, about how my parents order so much shit they don’t need and packages stack up, so i’m not offended by that. but i’m a little concerned by the fact that he sent it to his best friend. i did check to see what his best friend said to see if he was like “yeah you got a sugar mommy” (i know, im snooping) and all he said was “mann that’s crazy”. 

now i’m overthinking and wondering … is he just acting so so sweet and loving and saying he wants to marry me because he’s trying to get a financially secure family in law? or because he knows i’m going to be making hella money as a doctor?

we’ve kinda had this conversation before because when we met he really had no money at all and i was paying for a lot of stuff. he was behind on rent so i ended up paying for all of his and my food and once for his gas the first month (to be fair he’s always the one driving me around and he drives four hours a week to see me, we’re long distance). i’m also in school and he had no job for two weeks so he stayed at my apartment, and yeah, i was paying for everything. at the time, he said that he doesn’t expect me to work and that he wants to be the one who provides for me and pays for things, completely denied wanting money from me or my family. he said he felt guilty and ashamed that i had been paying for everything. he said he no longer wants me to pay for him and he wants to be the one paying because he doesn’t want me to worry about that or ever suspect that he’s with me for my money because he’s not. since then he’s gotten into a better financial position (started working again, like i said, he’s constantly working) and now he pays for most things, but i still will buy him food or coffee here or there. i know that he has his own apartment, i’ve stayed there several times. and whenever we go out for food he tells me to get whatever i want and never complains about prices.

it’s just that that video bothered me. and, even though he’s been paying for everything the past 2 months, it wouldn’t be hard to put down a short term investment like that for a long term investment (spend a couple thousand on me now, then we get married and he gets my and my family’s money). he says all the right things, saying he wants to work and provide for me, and lately he’s been doing the right things, but i’m just worried. does it sound like he might be with me for my/my family’s money, or that this is a misunderstanding and he was just joking around with his friend?",1,1766125399.0,women,3,1.0,False

1pqdz7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pqdz7e/eu_roasters_with_sl28light_roasts_no_budget/,EU roasters with SL28/light roasts [no budget],"I recently started getting more into light roasts and trying different roasters/varieties.

Im working with the Lelit Mara X and the Varia VS3 with upgraded Hypernova Ultra-S burrs. I usually get some of the tasting notes but today I tried the SL28 Panama from LF Coffee and was blown away. Even though it’s only 8 days after roast (couldn’t resist) I got all the cherry, blackcurrant and even a bit of caramel which they described. It had a pleasant acidity and sweetness to it. Out of the light roasts I tried this is by far my favourite.

Now for my question: Which (EU based) roasters can you recommend that have SL28 and are there different varieties you would recommend for me to try next ? I was planning on ordering from Manhattan Roasters next.",1,1766125288.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
