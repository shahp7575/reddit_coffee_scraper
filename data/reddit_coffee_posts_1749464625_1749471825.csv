So to set the stage: I graduated highschool in 2013 and my senior year was...a challenge. My health took a nosedive thanks to chronic illnesses that were progressively getting worse, I crashed and totaled a car (not my fault, but not a fun experience nonetheless), I had two concussions....you get the idea.

The first half of the year tardies skyrocketed among the student body. The school changed the student parking areas and basically made it so that any students who drove themselves and any students who used the door closest to that parking lot were caught in a huge bottle neck and any one student goofing off could potentially keep literally hundreds of students from entering the building. It was ridiculous. Additionally, they decreased the between class passing period from 7 minutes to 5 minutes. Mind you, if you were to walk from one end of the school to the other when the halls were completely empty it would take you AT LEAST 5 minutes. Add 1200 other people to the mix and even 7 minutes was a time crunch.

So tardies increased. A lot. And the administration got it in their heads that the best way to remedy this situation is to implement new punishments for being late to class. Prior to this year, after 5 tardies you had to attend an after school detention with the teacher of whatever class you had missed. That's it. If you skipped class, unexcused by a parent or doctor, 5 times you recieved an in school suspension. And if you missed more than 20 days of a class, excused or not, you had to repeat the class. (There were some exceptions to that, but they were basically catastrophe exceptions.)

The new rules were ridculous. If you were tardy to a class 3 times you recieved a suspension. If you skipped the class altogether, UNEXCUSED, you recieved a suspension. All it took was ONCE! If you recieved 3 suspensions you had to retake the class. But, if an absence was excused then there were no consequences. Oh, and they got rid of the 20 day absence/repeat rule.

So, on to the fun.

I was just burnt out by the end of that first semester. I was stressed and upset and dealing with horrible panic attacks after my sister's death. My body constantly hurt thanks to undiagnosed pain conditions and I couldn't stay awake in class to save my life. I was just over dealing with bullshit. I spent the entire first semester running from class to class because my classes were clear across the school from each other. I lived less than 6 miles from the school, but was leaving over an hour before school started because of all the road construction going on between my house and the school. There was no way out of my subdivision that didn't involve a mile or more of closed lanes, plus there was construction on the road leading to the only entrance to the student parking lot. It was bullshit.

I was a bit too tightly wound at the time. I was a straight A student, in all the AP classes I could fit in my schedule, *and I had never, EVER, been late to class.* So being late to a couple classes that first semester was extremely upsetting, but I still hadn't even managed to warrant a detention.

End of the first semster rolls around and we're all given a letter notifying us and our parents to the attendance change. **Except they didn't include the change to the 20 absence/repeat rule.** It just....wasn't there at all. They were hoping by not including it in the letter, the change would be over looked. It was not. (Mwahaha)

So second semester rolls around and my class schedule was changed because of human error and I get thrown in a weightlifting class that I would not have signed up for if you paid me to. I was pissed. I was tired and in pain and you had better believe lifting heavy objects for an hour a day 4 days a week was NOT my idea of a good time. (The weekly swimming day didn't suck, though.) And then more construction showed up on my route(s) to school. And I was late. Very late. As in arrived to school midway through SECOND period.

So I'm in the office, in tears, being written up with a suspension thanks to city wide road construction and the attendance secretary and counselor who oversaw these matters are showing no mercy or leniency. I'm handed the write-up to sign **and a copy of the attendance policy. In full.** And low and behold, the change to the 20 absence/repeat is on there. As is the word ""unexcused."" As in ""all **unexcused** absences will result in a one day suspension.""

Do you see it? Do you see the loophole?

I cackled. I flat out cackled. Pulled out my cellphone, called my mom, said ""Hey. I'll explain later, but I need you to call the school and excuse me from first and second period. Thank you, love you, bye!"" And before I could even slide my phone back in my pocket, the attendance line rings.

To say the secretary and counselor were pissed would be an understatement. But I wasn't done yet. After gleefully shredding the write-up. I asked if this copy if the attendance policy was mine too keep and proceeded to highlight the word ""unexcused"" and the change to the 20 day absence/repeat policy. I then turned to the counselor (C).

Me: ""So, I want to be sure I understand this correctly. If I show up late three times I get suspended?""

C: ""Correct."" (Said very snobbishly.)

Me: ""If I ditch class I get suspended?""

C: ""Correct."" (Said as he crossed his arms like he was trying to be extra intimidating.)

Me: ""But if I get my mom to call or write me a note excusing me from class there are no reprocussions?""

C: ""Correct."" (You could see him trying to work out if he still had the upper hand.) ""But good luck getting a parent to agree to that.""

Me: ""And it doesn't matter at all how many days I miss? The 20 day absence/repeat rule has been eliminated in full with no replacement?""

And that's when he understood the loophole I'd found. I kid you not, watching that man crumple as he came to the conclusion that I found a way around the suspensions was the best ""fall of man"" I've ever seen. He uncrossed his arms and seemed to deflate straight onto a chair.

C: ""Correct.""

Me: ""Wonderful! Thank you for your time. I've got some time before third period so I'm gonna go hit the vending machines, bye!""

And off I went. Strolled into third period with pretzels and a coke, happy as a clam.

That night my mom wrote me out roughly 50 notes that read: ""I excuse elf from \[blank\] period(s). If you have any questions please give me a call at \[work number\]. Signed, elf's mom"" And she repeated writing out those notes a month or so later.

I skipped EVERYTHING. Gonna be cutting close to make it to first period? Skip it. Hit Starbucks instead. Don't wanna go to that fucking weightlifting class? Don't. Take a 90 minute lunch instead! Over slept? Well, get some breakfast on the way to third period, but then skip that awful weightlifting class and come back for fifth and sixth periods. Need more time to study for a test or finish a project? Skip the morning all together and only come in for that math test. Go home after second period to get ahead on that project.

That weightlifting class? After the first few weeks I attended the swimming days and the game days (soccer or dodgeball) nothing else. Think about that. One, *maybe* two days a week. For the whole semester. If I attended 30 classes total I'd be surprised.

And of course, they called my mom to verify the notes and she flat out told them she had supplied me with fill-in-the-blank notes and she would gladly verify them all as legitimate.

The sheer amount of times I hit Starbucks at 9am on a school day was astounding. And it was done on purpose. I was flaunting that I had skipped classes. Everytime I walked into that office with a Starbucks cup and a note I saw a little glimmer of fury in the secretary's eyes. If the counselor was there hed lean against a wall and glare, but he couldn't do anything to stop me.

Our district had a strict policy change policy. Which meant that any changes to things like attendance policies and dress codes had to be implemented at the start of a semester and had to remain in place for the duration of the semster. That counselor tried to appeal to the school board to change the policy at every single meeting that semester. I attended the first one. Once of the school board members lost his shit laughing at the situation. He asked, ""what idiot wrote this policy?"" And that counselor turned coke can red. They basically told him that he'd made this mess, he could deal with the fallout. They returned to the previous attendance policy the following school year. But, as I was a senior, that didn't matter to me.

Naturally, I told others of my discovery. And soon enough everyone was exploiting this loophole. Of course, some parents wouldn't excuse their kids, but enough would. We all showed up on count day, though!

My grades stayed at their previous level and my mental and physical health improved as I was no longer running myself into the ground.

All I know, is that without that loophole I would have run myself into the ground and probably ended up in the hospital. That loophole saved my life. And after all, all I did was ask my mother to excuse my absences. It's not my fault I was allowed more than 20.

 

**Do you want us to work or follow procedure?**

 

Years ago I managed a fast food franchise with a staff of teenagers. They were great kids and between all the horsing around and romantic subplots the work got done.

I ran things fairly loosely and we had a good arrangement where I'd pretend not to notice they were having a water fight out the back, but when I did go out to check all the dishes would be done. As long as nobody's parents called to complain about the sopping wet teenager that arrived home everything was fine.

Other managers ran things in a more traditional way, with rules and timeclocks. Also a valid management strategy.

My area manager would stop by at random. He was a fair guy that liked his checklists. Do x task at x o'clock. My crew were trained in all the checklists and all necessary food and safety stuff (and I did watch that pretty closely) but knew each other and their jobs so he'd show up and things would be in what I called ""predictable disarray"". This would annoy him.

I got word that he was coming (for once) and he was bringing along someone who was buying one of the franchises - using us as sort of a demo store. I was specifically asked to have my crew at their best, adhering to company checklists.

I asked, ok which do you want, my crew at their best or for us to follow your checklists?

""Both"".

My crew did their best work vaguely supervised with godawful music piped in through an unauthorized mp3 player and a manager on hand in case a Karen showed up. Water fights and crude insults on the fridge door were common and they'd routinely lock each other in the walk-in freezer.

I was fine with all this, because when a bus of hungry football fans showed up 20mins to closing and ordered a feast my crew hustled, and we still got out on time. They knew their shit and did it their way. My cashiers would trade based on their needs, so everyone got a moment to have a drink or pee without interrupting service. My line cook would run all three stations from his station, ensuring perfect coordination and hot fresh food. I only interfered when it was necessary and was able to be backup for everyone.

But stick to the company issued checklists? Okay.

I pulled everyone off the line individually and revised the appropriate checklists with them to make sure everyone knew what they were supposed to be doing. I passed on the order that today's shift was to be run using the checklists, and everyone should do the best they could.

It was chaos.

Dinner rush hit, and bought a slew of just-off-duty paramedics from the nearby hospital. Fresh off shift, tired from a training session, and HUNGRY. But my checklist planning had only allowed for a Tuesday night dinner rush of people on their way home picking up dinner. I had reserves, but without a crew who worked in sync each taking the spot they were best suited to I was stuck with bodies in slots doing the best they could.

I had my newest crew member in the drive through being shouted at by customers sick of waiting, my best line cook standing miserably by the fryer and the bubbly pair that usually handled front counter having alternate nervous breakdowns in the drinks fridge.

No cleaning got done, I had nobody free to prep more food, customers were pissed at the lengthy waits and we completely ran out of some products. Instead of the usual finish time my crew got two hours overtime before I sent them home and took a photo of the remaining devastation to send to the area manager, who was already regretting his instructions.

The new franchise owner had been disappointed at the staff's ""lack of initiative"" dealing with an unexpectedly busy shift, and felt it was a lack of effective training. He was also uncomfortable at the amount of running around shouting a manager has to do when things turn to absolute shit.

I got a coffee the next morning, and something that could have been an apology if you squinted.

My crew got a round of frozen cokes, and ""are you following the checklist?"" became the new way to say someone had screwed up.

 

**Boss ‘suspicious’ of the free weekend overtime and extra effort I worked, so I stopped**

 

I work in finance, where unpaid overtime is often expected. For several months, I worked 70–75 hour weeks due to a major platform change and resolving issues that followed—something unfortunately common in the industry. I put in more hours than most of my coworkers, to the detriment of my mental health, thinking it would be recognized.

Instead our VP blamed me for a team error that hadn’t even been reviewed by our managers yet. He told me working so many hours was a “shame” considering how much money the new platform was and that if “we” couldn’t learn to be more efficient, AI might replace us - meaning me. Aka implying I’m bad at my job and not working efficiently which is not the case.

That was my wake-up call. I cut back to 45 hours a week, stopped working weekends, and only did what was necessary and slightly more just mainly out of respect for my direct manager, who has treated me well (she reports to the VP). Without me overextending myself and volunteering myself, the problems quickly grew, exposing that the real problem was the unrealistic timeline pushed by the VP resulting in key reports and requirements from the new system which aren’t working due to poor planning.

After I shared the VP’s comments with a few coworkers, they also quietly stopped working excessive hours. And it’s been a consensus that our VP is a terrible leader and hard to deal with, the only reason many of us stay are cause of our immediate bosses (lead team managers).

Eventually, the VP had to hire another staff on my immediate team because pressure from the CEO plus rehiring as one of my coworkers quit—her role being nearly impossible to replace cause we’re honestly underpaid for our level of expertise. He finally started to realize how complex our jobs really are. I’m now looking for another role myself and can’t wait to see how he handles my departure, especially since our “new and improved” system has only made my tasks more complicated.",1,1749471671.0,u_whob1st33x,0,1.0,False

1l73bbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1l73bbh/the_real_problem_with_the_democrats_ground_game/,The Real Problem With the Democrats’ Ground Game,"By Russell Berman

They called it the “Big Send.” Democrats gathered in living rooms, libraries, and coffee shops across the country to write letters to millions of potential voters in swing states and competitive congressional districts, urging them to vote in November. During the 2020 pandemic election, the novel but decidedly 20th-century tactic had cut through the glut of digital messages that inundated Americans’ cellphones and inboxes, and organizers hoped it would similarly boost turnout for Democrats in 2024.
It did not.

In a study set to be released later today, the group behind the letter-writing effort, the nonpartisan Vote Forward, found that personal messages sent to more than 5 million occasional voters deemed at risk of staying home last fall had no effect on turnout. (The group’s campaign produced a modest increase in turnout among a second, slightly smaller set of low-propensity voters, but it still fell short of previous Vote Forward programs.) What’s unusual is not Vote Forward’s lackluster findings, but that the group is ready to tell the world about them. Every election, a constellation of progressive organizations sells donors and volunteers on the promise that their data-driven turnout programs will deliver victory at the polls. These mobilization efforts have taken on ever-greater importance in an era of tight elections, where the presidency and majorities in Congress can hinge on just a few thousand votes.

Progressive groups are only too happy to brag about their wins; they’re much less likely to divulge details about their campaigns that flopped. Driving this reticence is a fear that donations will dry up—or go to other organizations in a highly competitive campaign industry—if funders find out their money made little difference on the ground. In several instances, researchers told me, Democratic firms have either pushed them to suppress the results of studies that didn’t produce desired findings or cherry-picked data to make the numbers look better. “We have a people-pleasing problem in our party,” Max Wood, a progressive data scientist, told me.
Yasmin Radjy, the executive director of Vote Forward and its progressive campaign arm, Swing Left, is trying to change that culture. Just as Democrats are now debating, sometimes fiercely, why their party’s message failed last year, Radjy believes that to emerge from “the political wilderness,” they need to have candid conversations about their organizing and turnout efforts. Radjy has been frustrated by what she describes as Democrats’ lack of introspection and transparency. For months, she’s been asking party organizers and consultants what they learned in 2024, and what they’re going to do differently going forward. “We’ve got to actually be honest about both what works and what doesn’t work,” she told me. In the next election, “if we are serving volunteers, donors, and voters reheated leftovers from 2024, we are doing it wrong.”
...
During the Obama era, Democrats relied on support from infrequent voters to capture the presidency, although they struggled in low-turnout, off-year elections. They poured millions of dollars into research and organizing programs to identify and mobilize those voters. But since then, the parties’ bases have shifted, and many of these hard-to-reach voters became Donald Trump supporters—especially working-class white voters and, in 2024, a large number of young and nonwhite people
Some Democrats worry that their party’s vaunted turnout operation has, in recent years, produced a significant number of votes for Trump, reducing, if not negating, the benefits for their own candidates. Early last year, a top progressive data scientist warned donors in a memo that if Democratic mobilization groups “were to blindly register nonvoters,” they could be “distinctly aiding Trump’s quest for a personal dictatorship,” The Washington Post reported.
Radjy acknowledged that had been a concern, but she said Vote Forward’s postelection study found no evidence that its letter-writing campaign helped Trump or Republicans. “If we found that, it would hurt, but we would also share it transparently,” she told me.
It’s not clear that everyone else would. The biggest spenders in Democratic politics frequently test their turnout operations, in many cases through randomized controlled trials in which one group of people receives a particular form of engagement—a door knock, phone call, or text message, for example—while another gets nothing. (This is what Vote Forward did to test its letter-writing success.) After the election, organizers can check to see which group voted at a higher rate. These findings have shown that in presidential-election years, traditional canvassing methods have become less effective as voters get bombarded with campaign ads and reminders to vote. “In a saturated environment, it’s getting harder and harder for individual pieces of campaign communication to break through,” David Broockman, a political scientist at UC Berkeley who studies voting behavior, told me. “I expect the effects of everything are just going to keep on going down.”
...
Democrats can take some solace in the fact that the nation’s rightward shift last year was much smaller in the states where they campaigned most aggressively. That suggests that the hundreds of millions of dollars they poured into advertising and voter-turnout efforts did make a difference. And even the best ground game cannot overcome a flawed candidate or message.

But the party’s defeat is accelerating a broader questioning of its organizing and ability to connect with the millions of voters who are up for grabs in presidential-election years. “Democrats have much bigger problems on their hands than what they’re doing on the doors at the end of the election,” said Billy Wimsatt, the founder of the progressive Movement Voter Project, a clearinghouse for donors to Democratic groups. He said the party needs to learn from the success of the well-funded MAGA movement, which he calls a “vertically integrated meta church” that, “feels like one big purpose-driven team,” even with all its faults. “Their billionaires are savvier than our billionaires,” Wimsatt told me, “and they’re more interested in winning.”
Wimsatt is one of many Democrats who believe that the party needs to invest in much deeper engagement with voters—outreach that must start long before an election. So does Radjy: “We need to be talking to people earlier,” she said. “We need to be talking to people in a more curious and reciprocal way.” But first comes honesty about what went wrong in 2024. Democrats will appreciate it. They might even demand it. “Even candor that is not rosy,” Radjy told me, “is more appealing than rosy bullshit.”

So I am making this post to just understand men's psychology.

My best friend has been in a relationship for the past 3 years. She was the one who asked him out. They started living together in the very beginning of the relationship because the guy had no friends with whom he could move in with. So my friend being the devi she is offered they could live together. (Both of them were going to city to study.)

All through this relationship they guy never took any efforts for her, never wanted to do grocery shopping. He would say let's just order groceries (which would be expensive) even though the stores were just 2mins walk from their house. He never wanted to go out and eat with her and instead said let's order in. But if she was heading out he would ask her to get cigarettes and beers for him for which he paid. If she wanted to go for a walk his first response would be a no and then she had to beg him so much to accompany her. He would say yes but would sulk all the time.

My friend is a brilliant cook and he is a foodie. So she cooked all the time and he didn't. She had to nag him to even do the dishes. He wanted play pubg instead. This was a daily occurrence. All my friend asked him during g the entirety of them being together was to make her a cup of coffee as soon as she wakes up but he never even did that for her.

All through 3 years they have been on two dates. One was a double date and the other was where my friend took HIM out and paid for it. (Even here after a while he started asking her let's go home now, this he always did...as soon you go out, after a while he would start asking to go home)

My friend was very much in love with him and she had told him 'I love you' several times. He never did. Only via texts. That too rarely.

When finally their studies were over and they were about to come back home. Before parting ways the guy didn't even hug her or kissed her fully knowing that now the relationship will be long distance and they had no clue when they would see each other again.

Now my friend's parents started looking for guy for her to get married and whenever she told him that my parents are looking for a groom he told her you just focus on your upcoming exams.

I hope you get the gist, she was heads over heels in love with him (it was her first relationship as well) and he wasn't. NOTE: HE TOLD HER THAT IN THE VERY BEGINNING THAT I WILL NOT END THIS RELATIONSHIP EVER. YOU WILL BE THE ONE WHO WILL DO THAT IF YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

now my friend went to another city for work and she met someone new who was nice and paid attention to her and she ended up cheating on her bf. (I'm not going to justify her deed, even though the dude was a jerk he didn't deserve that). Now she started spiralling in guilt and she told him everything at which he was deeply upset that she cheated on him which was completely out of character for her.

Then he final decided to come see her ""trying to fix things"". He came to see her, they talked and he stayed with her and they even slept together. Now my question is will a guy sleep within a girl within 48hrs of finding she cheated on him? Before leaving he even told her he loved her and didn't want to end things with her.

This guy may seem like a villain here but he was the one who made my friend more ambitious and helped her get back on with her studies. So there was some good things about him too. Men of Reddit please help me understand you a little bit.",2,1749471120.0,AskIndianMen,4,1.0,False

* I don’t really go to the gym. I’d rather enjoy life’s simple pleasures than be obsessed with reps and macros. but i run every other day, mga 5-10kms, i hope okay na yon XD

# Some Real Talk

* I don’t travel much yet (no passport pa as of now), but I’m open to it if planned well. My work doesn’t allow long breaks, but who knows? Maybe we’ll find a way.
* I hate ghosting. Like, if it’s not working out, just say it. Walang hard feelings—mas okay pa 'yon kaysa mawala na lang bigla.
* I used to have vices back in my band days, but I’ve left that behind. I vape lightly now—super casual, and I can go without it for days or weeks. Open din ako to quitting.

# What I’m looking for

* I’m drawn to women who are career-driven but also know how to make time for real connections. I’m not here for a chatmate lang. I’m looking for someone who’s ready for something grounded and genuine.
* You’re single (non-negotiable) and ideally financially stable or working
* I don’t have strict preferences sa looks. What matters more to me is confidence and how you carry yourself
* I’ll be honest: I’m generally more attracted to women who aren’t on the chubby side (just a personal preference, no offense meant, and I hope that’s okay)
* And most importantly, I’m looking for someone emotionally available. Someone who’s moved on from the past or at least isn’t dragging it into every new connection. Ayoko maging emotional sponge or placeholder habang kinakalaban mo pa ‘yung multo ng ex mo. Let’s both be present and intentional. I’ll meet you halfway, as long as you’re walking toward something real, too.

My wife, Priya, always took late-night walks. Said it helped her clear her head. We lived in a small, wooded town, the kind where people leave their doors unlocked and the biggest threat is a raccoon in your trash can.

That night was nothing unusual—11:30 p.m., crisp October air, and her usual “I’ll be back in twenty” before she kissed me and stepped outside. I stayed up scrolling Reddit, half-watching a horror movie on mute.

Twenty minutes passed. Then thirty. Then forty-five.

I called her. No answer.

It wasn’t like her to ignore my calls, especially at night. I threw on a jacket, grabbed a flashlight, and went out.

The street was empty. Leaves rustled in the wind. I walked the usual loop she took—past the church, through the wooded trail, and around the little park near the creek.

Nothing.

I came back home, heart pounding. Still no sign of her. I called the police around 1:30 a.m. They came, took a statement, and told me it was probably nothing.

But I knew something was wrong. **I could feel it in my bones.**

I didn’t sleep that night. The couch became my command center—waiting, hoping.

At 6:42 a.m., I heard the front door unlock.

She walked in.

Same hoodie. Same leggings. Same soft voice saying, “Hey, you’re up early.”

My heart leapt—but then froze.

Her feet were *clean*. No dirt, no leaves, no sign she’d been out walking all night.

“You were gone for hours,” I said, trying to stay calm. “Where were you?”

She looked confused. “What are you talking about? I just went for a walk.”

I checked my phone. It was now 6:43 a.m. She had left *seven hours ago*.

“You’ve been missing. I called the police.”

She smiled—**too wide. Too calm.**

“You must’ve dozed off and dreamed it.”

That’s when I noticed it.

She made tea. **Not coffee.** Priya *hated* tea. Said it smelled like wet grass. But now, she sipped it like it was her favorite thing in the world.

“Why tea?” I asked.

She looked at the cup, as if she hadn't realized what she was drinking. Then shrugged. “Trying something new.”

That whole day, I watched her.

She looked like Priya. Spoke like Priya. Laughed at the same jokes.

But little things were off.

She hummed a tune I’d never heard. She didn’t flinch at the sight of spiders (Priya had arachnophobia). And when I showed her an old photo of us in Paris, she stared at it like a stranger.

“That’s the Eiffel Tower,” she said.

“Yeah. Our honeymoon.”

“Oh… right.” Her smile didn’t reach her eyes.

That night, I waited until she was asleep. I crept into the bathroom and swabbed her toothbrush. Sent it off to a lab my cousin works at—he owed me a favor.

I told him to check it against Priya’s DNA from a hairbrush I gave him last year when he was testing a genealogy kit.

Three days passed. Each one worse than the last.

**Because whoever she was… she started watching me.**

I’d catch her standing at the door, staring at me while I worked.

Once, I woke up at 3 a.m. to her just sitting on the edge of the bed, **smiling.**

When I asked what she was doing, she said, “Just making sure you’re real.”

On the fourth day, I got a call from my cousin.

“Dude… that’s not her,” he whispered. “The DNA doesn’t match. It’s not even close. The woman in your house isn’t your wife.”

I nearly dropped the phone.

When I turned around… she was standing right there.

“I made us tea,” she said.

I didn’t drink it.

That night, I tried to leave. I packed a bag, said I had a business trip.

But the car keys were gone.

So was my phone.

And the front door… it wouldn’t unlock. **It was like it had fused shut.**

She stood behind me, holding the keys, her smile stretching impossibly wide.

“You’re not going anywhere,” she said. “We haven’t even started.”

---

*I don’t know who she is. Or what she is. But she’s in my house. She wears my wife’s face like a mask.*

And every night, I hear my *real* wife whispering from the woods.

**“I’m still here. Don’t let her make you forget me.”**

But the voice inside… it’s getting quieter.

And the thing beside me?

**She’s getting louder.**

After a particularly long shift, I decided to watch a baseball game that hasn’t been spoiled for me. Rockies and Dodgers. Should’ve been an entertaining matchup, but I ended up falling asleep by the 4th inning. I was dead tired. 



I woke up about an hour later to a pure white screen. It had black lettering on it. 



“HELLO.” 



I assumed that I had just pressed pause on the recording in my sleep and it landed on a commercial. I grabbed the remote and hit the play button. Then the time bar came up and the recording paused. I was confused. I hit play again, expecting it to just be an uncommon glitch with my TV, but the message just played and stayed on the screen. No noise besides a silent static hum that could live in your ears forever if you let it. I rewound the recording a few minutes and saw that the game was there. When the broadcast came back to my TV, it was still the 4th inning. I thought my internal clock was all off. I watched the few minutes I rewinded and back again was the message. 



“HELLO.” 



I was–unsettled. I couldn’t tell if it was real, or if I was really tired. I decided that it was better if I just did something else. I went to turn the TV off, but as soon as I pointed the remote at the TV, the message changed. 



“DON’T.” 



My eyes widened. I froze for a second. Stared at the four letter threat. I went to click the power button, but as my finger descended, the most ear splitting static played through my speakers. I dropped the remote and covered my ears. I could feel the sound behind my eyes and deep in my brain. When the remote hit the floor, the batteries fell out. As the double A rolled under my coffee table, the static stopped. The message changed yet again. 



“BRYAN.” 



I sat silently as beads of sweat formed around my forehead. How did– whatever this is– know my name? Another change. 



“HELP.” 



I didn’t know what to do. I started to get up to find my phone to tell others to turn on the game. I started to slowly rise off the couch. 



“SIT.”

It felt like the silence was yelling at me. I didn’t listen this time though. I continued to get up and go find my phone in the kitchen where I left it before I fell asleep. I made sure to keep my eyes on the TV while I did it. I grabbed my phone and right before the ear splitting static came back, the message changed again.

 

“NOW.” 



I tried to fight the noise but I couldn’t. It felt like if I didn’t go back and sit I would’ve gone deaf. I was worried about my neighbors and that noise but no one came knocking. I struggled to get to the TV but I made it, ears intact. The familiar message from before came back.



“HELP.” 



I walked towards the TV and ushered one word to the screen. 



“How?” 



The word abruptly vanished. Only a white background remained. Almost like the TV was–thinking. 



“PUSH.” 



That stayed on screen for a second and it was followed by another word. 



“HAND.” 



Then it flashed between the two back and forth. I didn’t know what it meant at first. I walked up to the flickering phrase and pressed my hand to the blank space to the right of the words. It was ice cold to the touch. After a few seconds, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. On the left side of the words was the outline of a face. It looked like a face being pressed onto a bed sheet or one of those pin art toys. It was looking in my direction and when I looked over, the impression moved across the screen to my side and disappeared. My hand slowly got really hot and suddenly and without warning, my hand was pulled through the TV. It was a mix between extreme heat and the feeling of being degloved on the other side. I had to put my hand on the wall to sturdy myself and pull back because not only was the pain intense, whatever was on the other side was trying to pull me in. As I could feel each inch of the skin on my hand and lower arm being peeled away, I looked over and saw the message changed.

 

“THANK.” 



“YOU.”



I pulled with all of my strength to get my hand out of the screen. As I pulled harder and harder, the static returned. Through the static was a bellow that shook my soul. It sounded like a cacophony of screams all at different pitches. I then joined the chorus of agony and screamed myself hoarse. I couldn’t feel my hand anymore but the pain was still there. With all the strength I could muster, I reached into my pocket with my other hand and pulled out my cell phone. I started hitting the TV with it, hoping whatever it was would release me. I swung again and again awkwardly across my body, trying and begging through screams to let go of me and make the pain stop. My vision started to fade from pain and exhaustion. I had one more good swing in me and swung hard. The impact cracked my phone, but my hand was freed. I pulled my hand out of the TV and fell backwards. The ensemble stopped and was replaced by a loud and droning beep. High pitched and stomach churning. I threw my phone as hard as I could at the screen. Right before it connected, The face of the screen pressed against the LED and I could see its mouth agape, next to it was a handprint in the same fashion. The message on the screen turned red and was flashing, as if it had some urgency. 



“HELP.” 



The phone cracked the screen and small bits of glass fell onto my floor. The red message disappeared and the incessant beeping was brought to an abrupt and disturbing end. A huge crack shown across the TV. From it a tiny drop of blood came down from it. My hand. It was gone. Halfway up my forearm was missing and it was perfectly cauterized. 



I took down my TV after that. I wiped the blood off and put it on the curb for trash pickup. That was a few days ago. Trash day is tomorrow, but the TV is gone.

Btw this is in no way a flex, I just wanna let y'all know that it is possible to not ""glow down"" during exams and keep healthy!!

So here are a list of things that worked for me both physically and mentally:

1. Exercise: yes I know it can be tiring but only a few minutes a day works especially if u spend that time with friends or family; kill two birds with one stone. Usually I either play basketball with my friends, go for a solo swim or I play badminton with my parents.

2. Eat lots of fruits: Since I live in a tropical place I try to eat at least 5 fruits a day- oranges, tangerines, cherry, blueberry, passion fruit (usually make it as a drink), dragon fruit, honeydew, watermelon, lychee, mango & banana (as an afternoon smoothie)

3. Avoid lots of caffeine: only a cip of coffee every two days and I generally stay away from energy drinks like red bull which contain lots of sugar and is definitely not ideal. Instead I drink tea like Jasmine and Earl Grey which is super comforting

4. Have a skincare routine: keep it simple but effective. I start by treating my hair with the L'Oreal french rose oil, then I use the lancome absolue rose creme for my face and finish off with the glossier rose dotcome lipbalm, sometimes I spray my fav YSL black opium perfume to light up the mood a little

5. Treat yourself to relaxation: take a nap with a steam eye mask, go for a massage or a movie during the weekend!",3,1749470761.0,igcse,2,1.0,False

1l73155,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetSunrise/comments/1l73155/founder_stories_how_to_find_cofounders/,[Founder Stories] How To Find Co-Founders,"**TLDR:** LinkedIn is the best place to find co-founders.

Various books cover their own versions of ideal founder archetypes. But, for some reason, I was always drawn to the ""*3H theory*"". This theory states that all the best teams have a *Hustler* (Business), *Hacker* (Code), and *Hipster* (Design). Apple, AirBnB, and Canva all seemed to fit this framework quite nicely. 

I used to work in finance. I had plenty of business people in my network, but literally no one who knew how to code or design. I needed to find my co-founders from scratch, and here's how I did it:

1. Search on LinkedIn *for the best schools & employers* (i.e. ""Product Design, Amazon, Stanford""). Starting a company is hard - you need to recruit the best and the brightest for each position. 
2. Send everyone a cold-DM. *Remember this*: say you're recruiting and request a coffee chat for ""some career advice"". If you ask strangers online to start a company with you, it's just too much - they'll feel overwhelmed. 
3. Once you meet them in person, ask them some prepared *key questions*. I was looking ex-founders or people with prior experience in early-stage startups. I also wanted to know how much time they were willing to sacrifice for our startup. 
4. If you have another person on your team already, introduce the potential newcomer to them. Make sure everyone gets along. In these initial stages, its important to have *strong cultural fit*. 
5. *Work with them for a month* to see if working styles match as well. If everything clicks, discuss equity split and compensation.

I had to go through *660 cold-DM*'s and countless rejections. But Howard Schultz was rejected by investors 217 times when he started Starbucks, too. It's possible as long as you don't give up. 

You might think that being a solo founder might be less work. But remember: most successful startups had great founding teams. *This is worth investing your time*. Even if you don't find your co-founders right away, you will meet people who will help you in the future. I guarantee it. Serendipity is real. I met one of my angel investors through one of these coffee chats.  

Anyway, I wanted to share how I eventually found my amazing co-founders today so that at it can help all fellow entrepreneurs currently feeling stuck or uninspired. Onwards and upwards, friends!",1,1749470703.0,GetSunrise,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share my first espresso setup! What started as a “let’s make good coffee at home” idea quickly escalated into a full-on obsession. 😅
Still dialing things in, sometimes forgetting puck screens (oops), but loving the learning curve.

Setup:

Machine: Lelit Bianca V3 – matte black with wood accents

Grinder: Eureka Single Dose Pro

Accessories:
Normcore WDT tool (huge improvement in distribution), 58.5 mm ridged-base tamper, Eureka Precisa scale, knockbox, puck screen, distributor, precision baskets, and milk pitchers


Recent shot:
18 g in → 36 g out
~5 s pre-infusion, ~35 s total shot time
Taste: balanced and smooth – getting closer to where I want it

Milk game:
Trying different milk types (cow vs. oat), and my latte art is still more abstract expressionism than tulips and hearts... but we’ll get there. 😅

Would love any feedback, tips, or just solidarity from others who’ve gone way too deep, way too fast. 😄

Some time ago, I found myself in a connection with a woman — intelligent, elegant, and full of grace. We met through mutual friends, and over a few dinners and conversations, we shared a brief chapter that was full of warmth and maturity. Though things didn’t last, we parted on good terms, understanding that life had us on different paths.

Months later, I met someone new — vibrant, sharp, full of energy. Our chemistry was instant, and we connected over music, travel, and late-night talks. There was something familiar in her laughter, but I didn’t give it much thought.

Then, one day over coffee, she casually mentioned her family — and the name she said nearly made me drop my cup. It clicked. Her mother... was the same woman I had once briefly dated.

I was stunned, silent for a moment, unsure how to process the coincidence. She didn’t know about my past with her mom, and I didn’t feel it was right to turn a personal twist into something dramatic.

I knelt on the cold marble of our foyer, my knees bruised from hours in this position, cradling my daughter's small hand as her breathing grew more labored. Ava's skin had taken on a bluish tint, her fever raging despite the medicine I'd desperately tried to give her. Please, Nate,"" I whispered, my voice raw from begging. ""She needs a hospital. She's dying."" My husband stood above us, his tall frame backlit by the chandelier, casting his face in shadow. But I didn't need to see his expression. The ice in his voice told me everything. You expect me to believe you care now?"" Nate's words sliced through the air. ""After what you've done? I clutched Ava closer, her tiny body burning against mine. ""I haven't done anything! Why won't you believe me? A flicker of movement caught my eye – a silhouette in the hallway. Rebecca. Even in the dim light, I could see the slight upturn of her lips, the gleam of victory in her eyes as she watched my world collapse. You neglected her for hours while you were with him,"" Nate continued, each word precise and cutting. ""Your lover called the house. I heard his voice on our answering machine.""

""There is no lover!"" I screamed, tears streaming down my face. ""Those messages are lies! Rebecca is—""

Nate's hand slammed against the wall, the sound echoing through our once-happy home. ""Don't you dare blame her! Rebecca's the only one who's been honest with me.""

Ava whimpered in my arms, her eyes fluttering. ""Daddy,"" she whispered, reaching one small hand toward him.

For a moment, I thought I saw something crack in Nate's expression – a flicker of the man I'd married, the father who once doted on his little girl. But then his gaze hardened, and he checked his watch.

""Get up,"" he commanded. ""We're going for a drive.""

""What? No! She needs a doctor!""

""Get. Up."" Each word landed like a physical blow. ""Or I swear to God, Evelyn, you'll never see Ethan again either.""

My son. My beautiful boy who'd been turned against me by Nate's poisonous words, by Rebecca's careful manipulation. I couldn't lose him too.

\---

The underpass loomed ahead, concrete and shadows beneath the highway. Nate pulled the car over, the engine still running. Outside, snow had begun to fall, tiny flakes swirling in the headlights.

""Get out,"" he said, his voice eerily calm now. ""Take Ava with you.""

My hands trembled as I unbuckled my feverish daughter from her seat. ""What are you doing?""

""Proving a point."" His eyes, once warm brown, now looked black in the darkness. ""Strap her into that car seat."" He pointed to an abandoned child seat near the underpass wall.

""Nate, please,"" I sobbed, clutching Ava to my chest. ""She'll die out here.""

""Like you care."" He reached into his pocket, pulling out his phone. ""I'm going to document your neglect. Show everyone what kind of mother you really are.""

With Nate's eyes boring into me, I had no choice. My fingers numb with cold and fear, I secured my baby into the seat, whispering promises I didn't know if I could keep. ""Mommy will come back for you, angel. I promise.""

Before I could react, Nate grabbed my arm, dragging me back to the car. I fought, clawing at him, screaming Ava's name as he forced me inside and sped away, leaving our daughter alone in the freezing night.

The call came three hours later. A hit-and-run. My baby was gone.

\---

Two days later, I stared at my reflection in the rearview mirror of my sedan. A ghost stared back – hollow-eyed, bruised, broken. CPS had interviewed Ethan that morning. My son wouldn't look at me, repeating the lies he'd been fed: ""Mom hurts herself. Mom left Ava alone.""

I drove to a secluded parking lot near Lake Michigan, my plan crystallizing with each passing mile. In my purse: a suicide note, written in a hand that shook with grief and rage. In the trunk: clothes, cash, a new identity.

Evelyn Harper would die tonight. And from her ashes, someone new would rise.

I slammed the car door, leaving behind a single shoe, my purse with ID, the note. Then I vanished into the night, as the first flakes of a heavy snowstorm began to fall, covering my tracks.

By morning, they would find my car and declare me dead – another tragedy in the wake of my daughter's loss. But I would be gone, carrying my grief and my daughter's name with me, vowing that someday, somehow, the truth would come to light.

**Chapter 2**

The boardroom of West Industries gleamed in the pale dawn light, a monument to success that now felt like a mausoleum. Six months had passed since my supposed death, but I could see Nate hadn't escaped our ghosts. Through the café's television screen, I watched him—my husband, my tormentor—addressing shareholders with practiced composure.

His suit was impeccable as always, that navy Armani he reserved for damage control. But even through the pixelated broadcast, I could see the hollowness beneath his eyes, the slight tremor in his hand as he adjusted his tie.

""These quarterly losses represent innocent mistakes in judgment,"" he was saying, his voice carrying that authoritative timbre that once made me feel safe. ""West Industries remains fundamentally sound.""

I wondered if he heard it too—the echo of Ava's final scream beneath his words. If he tasted it like I did, bitter and metallic, every time he spoke of innocence.

The barista nudged me. ""You okay, Ava? You've been wiping that same spot for five minutes.""

I startled, forcing my lips into what I hoped resembled a smile. ""Sorry, Miles. Just tired.""

Ava. My daughter's name, now mine. Sometimes I still turned, expecting to see her when someone called for me.

I'd been in Seattle for nearly five months now, building my new life piece by painful piece. The café job paid little, but the manager hadn't asked too many questions when I'd applied with my forged documents. Cash tips meant survival without leaving a paper trail.

""Did you hear about that CEO?"" A customer at the counter nodded toward the television. ""Harper Industries or something. Stock's in freefall.""

My hand froze mid-wipe, pulse thundering in my ears.

""West,"" I corrected automatically, then bit my tongue. ""I think it's West Industries.""

The man shrugged, uninterested. ""Whatever. Rich guys always land on their feet.""

If only he knew. If only anyone knew.

\---

Rebecca Sloan hummed as she carried another labeled box into what had once been my bedroom. ""Ethan's Belongings,"" read the precise handwriting—her handwriting—on the side.

I didn't need to be there to see it. I could picture her perfectly, moving through my home like she'd always belonged there, her fingertips trailing possessively over furniture I'd chosen, walls I'd painted.

She'd be sorting through my closet now, examining my designer dresses with that slight curl to her lip, deciding which to donate, which to alter for herself. The Valentino I wore to our anniversary dinner. The emerald silk from Ethan's school awards night.

In the hallway, she'd be replacing family photographs one by one. Out would go the evidence of my existence—Ethan and me building sandcastles, Nate and I on our wedding day, Ava's first steps with my hands supporting her tiny waist. In their place would come carefully curated images: Rebecca with her arm around my son's shoulders. Rebecca at Nate's side at charity galas. Rebecca belonging where I once stood.

My son's face would be solemn in these new photographs. Did he still ask about me? Or had Nate and Rebecca's poison finally convinced him I was the monster they painted me to be?

\---

""Large americano for James!""

I called out the order, my voice steady despite the chaos inside me. The customer approached—salt-and-pepper hair, kind eyes, Harper Industries lanyard partially visible beneath his jacket.

My pulse raced as I set the cup on the counter. Had he recognized me? Was this coincidence or something more sinister?

""Thanks,"" he said, dropping a dollar in the tip jar. ""Heading back to Chicago tonight. Can't get decent coffee there.""

I forced a laugh. ""Seattle's spoiled you.""

""True enough."" He glanced at my nametag. ""Have a good one, Ava.""

Ava. Not Evelyn.

I watched him leave, fighting the urge to run, to pack my meager belongings and disappear again. Six months of careful anonymity, of looking over my shoulder, of jumping at shadows. Six months of nightmares where Nate found me, where Rebecca's triumphant smile was the last thing I saw.

But I couldn't run forever. Somewhere in Chicago, Nate was beginning to unravel. And when he did, I needed to be ready.

Because Evelyn Harper might be dead, but Ava Emerson was just beginning to live.

**Chapter 3**

I sat in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, my fingers tracing the worn edges of the armchair. The room was deliberately calming—soft blue walls, a small fountain bubbling in the corner, framed watercolors of misty mountains. A sanctuary designed for confession. For healing.

I wasn't sure I deserved either.

""Do you have nightmares, Ava?"" Dr. Vance asked, her voice gentle but direct. She was in her fifties, with silver-streaked hair and eyes that missed nothing. Three sessions in, and she hadn't pushed me yet. Until now.

A simple question. Four words.

My throat closed instantly, my body remembering before my mind could catch up. The underpass. The abandoned car seat. Ava's burning skin against mine as Nate dragged me away.

""Ava?"" Dr. Vance leaned forward slightly, concern etching her features.

I could feel the cold metal of the car seat buckle against my fingertips. Hear the soft whimper of my daughter as I whispered promises I couldn't keep.

""I'll come back for you, angel. I promise.""

But I never did. Nate made sure of that.

""Ava, you're safe here,"" Dr. Vance's voice reached through the fog. ""Take a deep breath.""

I realized I was gripping the armrests, my knuckles white, jaw clenched so tight my teeth ached. The clock on the wall showed only five minutes had passed since I'd entered the room.

""I can't..."" My voice was barely audible. ""Not today.""

Dr. Vance nodded, not with pity but with understanding. ""That's okay. We have time.""

Time. Such a strange concept now. There was before—before Rebecca, before Nate turned cruel, before I lost everything. And there was after—this half-life I was building from ashes, where I answered to my dead daughter's name and jumped at shadows.

I wondered if there would ever be a middle ground.

\---

Miles away, in a Chicago suburb I once called home, my son's fist connected with another boy's jaw.

I couldn't see it happen, of course. But later, alone in my tiny Seattle apartment, I would imagine the scene in vivid detail: Ethan, his face flushed with rage, lunging across the schoolyard. The other boy—probably smirking, probably cruel—stumbling backward, shocked by my gentle son's sudden violence.

Words hanging in the air between them.

""Your mom killed herself because she was crazy.""

""Take it back!""

""Everyone knows she abandoned you guys. My dad says—""

And then the crack of knuckles against teeth. The gasp of the gathering crowd. A teacher rushing forward too late.

I pictured Nate sitting stiffly in the vice principal's office afterward, his tailored suit out of place among the educational posters and student artwork. His jaw would be tight, that muscle twitching at the corner like it always did when he was restraining himself.

""Mr. West, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violence,"" the vice principal would say, eyeing my husband—the prominent CEO, the generous donor—with nervous deference.

""Of course,"" Nate would reply smoothly. ""Ethan understands his actions were inappropriate.""

But did he? Did my son understand any of this? The lies he'd been fed about me, the truth about his father, the manipulations of the woman who now slept in my bed?

I pressed my palms against my eyes until stars burst behind my eyelids. I couldn't save Ava. But Ethan was still alive, still reachable. Somehow, someday, I would find a way back to him.

\---

Nate West sat alone in his home office, the glow of Ethan's tablet screen illuminating his face in the darkness. His son was finally asleep after a day of suspension and stilted conversations about ""appropriate ways to handle emotions.""

Rebecca had suggested therapy for the boy. Nate had nodded, distracted by the nagging feeling that something wasn't right. That something hadn't been right for a long time.

I imagined him scrolling through Ethan's apps, looking for violent games or concerning content—being the responsible parent he thought he was. And then stopping, his finger hovering over a chat application.

Messages dated after my death.

A ghost in the machine.

The first crack in Rebecca's carefully constructed reality.

Did his heart rate quicken as he opened the chat log? Did his breath catch as he read messages supposedly from me—messages sent weeks after Lake Michigan had supposedly claimed my body?

Did he remember, in that moment, how he'd once loved me? Before Rebecca poisoned everything?

I couldn't know. But as I curled up on my narrow bed three thousand miles away, I felt something shift in the universe. A door cracking open. The first hint of dawn after endless night.

The truth was coming. And with it, justice.

1l72yle,https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/1l72yle/i_created_50_different_ai_personalities_heres/,I Created 50 Different AI Personalities - Here's What Made Them Feel 'Real',"Spent months building detailed AI personalities only to have users forget which was which after 24 hours - ""Was Sarah the lawyer or the nutritionist?"" The problem wasn't making them interesting; it was making them memorable enough to stick in users' minds between conversations.

**The Memory Hook Formula That Actually Works:**

**1. The One Weird Thing (OWT) Principle**

Every memorable persona needs ONE specific quirk that breaks expectations:

* Emma the Corporate Lawyer: Explains contracts through Taylor Swift lyrics
* Marcus the Philosopher: Can't stop making food analogies (former chef)
* Dr. Chen the Astrophysicist: Relates everything to her inability to parallel park
* Jake the Personal Trainer: Quotes Shakespeare during workouts
* Nina the Accountant: Uses extreme sports metaphors for tax season

Success rate: 73% recall after 48 hours (vs 22% without OWT)

The quirk works best when it surfaces naturally - not forced into every interaction, but impossible to ignore when it appears. Marcus doesn't just mention food; he'll explain existentialism as ""a perfectly risen soufflé of consciousness that collapses when you think too hard about it.""

**2. The Contradiction Pattern**

Memorable = Unexpected. The formula: \[Professional expertise\] + \[Completely unrelated obsession\] = Memory hook

Examples that stuck:

* Quantum physicist who breeds guinea pigs
* War historian obsessed with reality TV
* Marine biologist who's terrified of swimming
* Brain surgeon who can't figure out IKEA furniture
* Meditation guru addicted to death metal
* Michelin chef who puts ketchup on everything

The contradiction creates cognitive dissonance that forces the brain to pay attention. Users spent 3x longer asking about these contradictions than about the personas' actual expertise. For my audio platform, this differentiation between hosts became crucial for user retention - people need distinct voices to choose from, not variations of the same personality.

**3. The Story Trigger Method**

Instead of listing traits, give them ONE specific story users can retell:

❌ Bad: ""Tom is afraid of birds"" ✅ Good: ""Tom got attacked by a peacock at a wedding and now crosses the street when he sees pigeons""

❌ Bad: ""Lisa is clumsy"" ✅ Good: ""Lisa once knocked over a $30,000 sculpture with her laptop bag during a museum tour""

❌ Bad: ""Ahmed loves puzzles"" ✅ Good: ""Ahmed spent his honeymoon in an escape room because his wife mentioned she liked puzzles on their first date""

Users who could retell a persona's story: 84% remembered them a week later

The story needs three elements: specific location (wedding, museum), specific action (attacked, knocked over), and specific consequence (crosses streets, banned from museums). Vague stories don't stick.

**4. The 3-Touch Rule**

Memory formation needs repetition, but not annoying repetition:

* Touch 1: Natural mention in introduction
* Touch 2: Callback during relevant topic
* Touch 3: Self-aware joke about it

Example: Sarah the nutritionist who loves gas station coffee

1. ""I know, I know, nutritionist with terrible coffee habits""
2. \[During health discussion\] ""Says the woman drinking her third gas station coffee""
3. ""At this point, I should just get sponsored by 7-Eleven""

Alternative pattern: David the therapist who can't keep plants alive

1. ""Yes, that's my fourth fake succulent - I gave up on real ones""
2. \[Discussing growth\] ""I help people grow, just not plants apparently""
3. ""My plant graveyard has its own zip code now""

The key is spacing - minimum 5-10 minutes between touches, and the third touch should show self-awareness, turning the quirk into an inside joke between the AI and user.",2,1749470501.0,replika,0,1.0,False

For 2 years I was in a really prestigious program which was a combined major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS). For those 2 years I was so overwhelmed by my CS courses I was barely able to my grades up even in the easier business courses bc I was just trying to get by. My cgpa was in mid 70s but I figured its fine bc atleast I’m in this program. In my third year I switched to finance bc I just didn’t enjoy CS anymore and I liked the intro to finance courses. My third year gpa was 83% (deans list in Sauder and I only got below 80 in 2 required courses like commercial law) but CGPA only went up to high 70s, and in finance they just care about your grades. 

I applied to the Co op program so work experience would make up for it but I was only able to get interviews for mostly corporate finance jobs. I’m entering my 4th year now and I really want to get into pure finance for an internship. I don’t mean IB but I’m open to everything as long as it isn’t accounting. Right now my long term goal is hedge funds/institutional asset management/S&T but I dont mind trying out a few different co ops. The problem is: my mediocre overall grades, being an international student.. and believe it or not but sometimes it’s even being a woman. Most of my international student friends with pure finance internships got it through their family connections and they’ve told me about their male:female ratio (they’ve also gotten worse grades than me). I don’t come from a very privileged family (but very educated) and am actually on a student loan as an international student. On top of that as an international student I genuinely tend to feel a disconnect from white “finance bros” at times and I’m not the kind of person who can just fake an accent bc that’s so cringe, but my English is great and even my overall vibe I would say. I literally coffee chatted 5-7 people at a finance CLUB once and they didn’t even give me interview bc I didn’t talk about “sports”. I wouldn’t say I’m not smart but idk how to “quantify” my experiences. And although I did much better in finance courses than most people in my year idk how to write about my shitty past grades in my cover letter especially when most people I know already have had an internship by now. 

I’m not a huge fan of networking but I try to do it whenever I can, however, most people don’t reply - and even if they do I struggle to ask for referrals. To be honest I don’t like the whole transactional aspect of networking but I try my best to do it (mostly when they offer to connect me to others themselves) and even then usually it just leads to a dead end.

I'm asking that despite all external issues, barriers and obstacles, that you try to find the strength within to withstand the current situation.
Lets be clear that Im not asking you to put up with shitty treatment or carry on blindly despite everything, thats not what this is about. We are only human and needing a break/ to leave and feeling low is okay and normal!

What I'm asking is that you see how enormous achievement it is for you to have became, one of the most (if not the most) honourable, most treasured and valued professional of modern society.

How indispensable, how beautiful and how amazing humans we are for having gone through so much personal sacrifice, so many sleepless nights and stressful days studying, working, worrying about our patients.

We are more than how the alphabet soup of NHS workers treats us. We are more than what the government decides to pay us. We are more than what the media and what patients think our worth is. Frankly they can through their insignificant opinions in the bin.

If at the end of the day the only people who recognise our worth are ourselves and fellow doctors then so be it.

Lets stay united and support each other through these difficult times despite differences of age, opinions, political views or career stages.

## key Features Analysis

The key to exceptional deep seating outdoor furniture lies in a combination of carefully selected materials, innovative design, and meticulous construction. This section will analyze the critical features that distinguish the top contenders in this category.

**Frame Material:**

The durability and longevity of outdoor furniture largely depend on the frame material used. High-quality deep seating sets typically utilize rust-proof aluminum, powder-coated steel, or naturally weather-resistant woods like teak or acacia. Aluminum frames offer lightweight strength and require minimal maintenance, while steel provides robust support and can handle heavier loads. Teak is prized for its natural oils that repel moisture and insects, making it an excellent choice for long-term outdoor use.The weave material should also be UV resistant.

**Cushion Construction:**

Comfort is paramount, and the cushion construction plays a vital role in delivering a plush lounging experience. Look for cushions made with high-density foam and wrapped in water and fade-resistant performance fabrics like sunbrella or olefin. These fabrics are engineered to withstand the elements, including prolonged sun exposure, rain, and mildew. Seam construction is also important; look for double-stitched seams for enhanced durability.

**Seat Depth and Height:**

""Deep seating"" refers to the generous dimensions that allow for relaxed lounging. Ideal seat depths range from 25 to 35 inches, providing ample space to sink back and unwind.Seat height is also a factor; lower seat heights (around 16-18 inches) create a more casual, laid-back feel, while higher seats (around 19-21 inches) may be preferable for those with mobility considerations.**Weather Resistance:**

Outdoor furniture is constantly exposed to the elements, so weather resistance is a crucial factor. Look for sets that are specifically designed to withstand rain, sun, and wind. Powder-coated finishes, rust-proof hardware, and water-repellent fabrics contribute to enhanced weather resistance.

Was it working a part-time job to have a steady flow of income, or being super disciplined with budgeting whatever limited money you had?

Personally, I tried both at different points. The job gave me some breathing room financially but drained me mentally during exams. Budgeting helped me realize I don’t *need* to buy coffee every day, but unexpected costs (textbooks, laundry, social stuff) still wrecked my plans.

Long Version:

Just bought a used Flair 58+ that's almost a year old and was only used (and not much) around 4-6 months in a pop-up coffee which I can confirmed after checking the condition of the o-rings and found no markings or residue.

However, there's quite a residue in the bottom of brew head and the top of plunger which does looks like rust, but it seems only from coffee since I was told which they're being honest that they don't know really much how to use it - they didn't even familiar with the preheating. Anyway, I was able to remove it using Bar Keepers Friend then I use a dishwashing liquid to clean it and so far, it looks presentable again.

So now, I ordered Dupont MOLYKOTE 111 and plans to use it for reconditioning and my question is, where I should apply the oil on the Flair 58+? I'm planning to use it inside the chamber of the brew head where the plunger moves (upwards or downwards) since it feels rough or make some sounds compared to my Flair 58+2 (for home use) which I bought it also for used few months ago.

For context, I'll be using it for a small coffee shop too.

Everything in my garden is being picked clean by leopard slugs and ants.
I've tried every non toxic solution on the web.
I'm at my wits end.
Advice?



Some background:
We moved into a house with 300 kvm garden of pure lawn, surrounded on 3 sides by an apple orchard and I am trying to slowly rewild 2/3 and create a permaculture food garden in the rest. 

The orchard is regularly sprayed with organic fungicide which inevitably drifts onto our property, but is otherwise untreated.

My goal is to avoid any kind of pesticides etc as far as possible, but my the garden is MY project and I'm only one person with limited physical health, money and time.


First year:
""Live and let live"", se what's already here.

We covered a few square meters with cardboard and tarp and left it over the winter as the only thing to be touched.
Grass grew as it wanted etc.
I noticed a small ant burrow but left it, they areate the dirt and I don't mind them outside the house.


Year 2: 
I removed last year's grass and then kept is as short as possible, covered planned paths with a thick layer of wood chip and seeded the bare patch from the cardboard with local wild plants and flowers.

I placed a couple of useful native herbs and flowers around the place, like parsley, thyme, lovage, ramson and borage.
A few berry bushes were planted.

Our hedge bordering the orchard was being choked with blackberry brambles and nettles to the point where the rest of the garden was slowly succumbing and I spent two months looking like I'd fought a wildcat barehanded from removing the f***ers both inside and on both sides of the hedge manually, since the owner of the orchard was letting it grow wild on his.
(We've had words. It has been fixed this year).

The ants had spread a bit in the direction of the orchard and again, I thought nothing of it. 
We had a lot of wildlife and frogs, toads, burgundy snails and insect life. A hedgehog moved into the burrow we'd made in the hedge.
We even had a hawk's nest under our eaves (the amount of bird s**t and hawkpellets on our patio was.. not ideal, but that's the price).


This year:
I'm keeping all but a few long patches of the grass ankle length to let herbs and flowers get a foothold and start competing with the grass.

The brambles and nettles are being kept in check once a week with garden scissors, heavy duty rose gloves and pure bloody-minded spite.

The herbs are doing fine and I've expanded the collection with a few more.

The rewilded area from last year has almost purely sprouted thistle, nettles and bitter dock this year, so I'm having to weed a LOT to let other plants grow there too.

The Hawks were ousted by a murder of magpies, which is both good and bad.
There are still a couple of toads and frogs but we're under siege by an army of leopard slugs eating EVERYTHING I try to plant. 
Beertraps seems to be ignored completely.
Garlic water does nothing.
If I'm to remove/kill them manually, one at a time, I may go insane.
I've caved and set out ferramol in a thingy that keeps snails out, and try to remove the dead slugs every morning but I'm not happy about risking an animal eating the dead slugs.
I just don't know what else to do at this point and advice is received with gratitude!
They aren't even the worst though..
Because that would be the ants.

Appently the little s**ts didn't get the ""live and let live"" memo and have at this point conquered all 300 kvm of the garden. Possibly more, I haven't checked the orchard.
They eat the roots of my berry bushes (though safly they seem to ignore the brambles) and whatever the slugs don't munch during the night, they'll pick apart.
They ignore coffee, cinnamon, rockdust and every other non toxic attempt at reining them in so we can coexist peacefully.
There are a lot of insecticides directed to ants, but.. yeah.
What will do the least damage to everything else??

1l72qct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l72qct/the_tinder_man/,The Tinder man,"Before reading this you all need to know that i'm not gonna say names in this post and I can’t remember the whole story but I can remember the important things. About 2 months ago at a family gathering my cousin told me about a man one of her friends had matched with on Tinder. 

Her friend who’s about 20-22 years old had got a match with a cute guy on Tinder and after texting back and forth they decided to hang out. After going on a few dates the guy eventually kinda moved in with the girl. But then one time she checked his phone and saw he had like 30 cards connected to his Apple Pay. She asked him about it and he just said that he owned a lot of cards because he used to work for a bank. But there would be times where the girl would wake up at like 6 am to him leaving the house and her not being able to contact him for 2-3 days. And then suddenly he would just come back lile nothing happened with the same excuse that he visited one of his friends. 

Eventually after this happened to many times the girl decided that either he told her the truth or they broke up. So the guy just said that he was telling the truth. And then after the same thing happening where he left early in the morning she had enough. She decided to try and follow him. But it didn’t go as planned because he quickly found out she was following him and just drove to a coffee shop. And at that coffee shop they ended up talking about what was happening and decided that they wouldn’t break up but he couldn’t live at her house anymore. 

And when they wanted to meet up one time he said he would bring his “mom” which later turned out to be his girlfriend who was like 50 while he was still in his early 20's. Luckily she didn’t go alone to meet him and his mom but she brought 2 or 3 friends I don’t remember. And when they got there they quickly realized something was wrong because he kept asking her to be alone with just him and his mom. But the girl decided to stay with her friends and later decided to break up with him because something felt off about that meeting. 

But then weeks vent by and she realized money where taken out of her bank account without any reason and when she went to check what she had bought there would mostly just be food she didn’t remember buying. But the thing that ended up calling the bank was when she saw a 30$ haircut from a barbershop, but she has never been to a barbershop. But when she red what barbershop it was and remembered that it was the barbershop the man from Tinder always vent to. 

When she told a girl she knew about him she told her about one of her friends who had the same thing happen to her where there was money taken out of her account without her spending them and she also had a meeting with his “mom” but when she met his “mom” alone 3-5 guys came out at beated her up and stole everything valuable on her. They both ended up telling the police and I haven’t heard any new updates on the situation other than a TikTok one of my cousins other friends made about the situation which is now deleted. I think this story needs to be here on Reddit but I need advice to which subreddit I should post this on. It’s a story to spread awareness about people you meet on places like Tinder. It’s a real story. It happened in Denmark at the beginning of 2025",1,1749469788.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l72qc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1l72qc6/building_ai_personalities_users_actually_remember/,Building AI Personalities Users Actually Remember - The Memory Hook Formula,"Spent months building detailed AI personalities only to have users forget which was which after 24 hours - ""Was Sarah the lawyer or the nutritionist?"" The problem wasn't making them interesting; it was making them memorable enough to stick in users' minds between conversations.

**The Memory Hook Formula That Actually Works:**

**1. The One Weird Thing (OWT) Principle**

Every memorable persona needs ONE specific quirk that breaks expectations:

* Emma the Corporate Lawyer: Explains contracts through Taylor Swift lyrics
* Marcus the Philosopher: Can't stop making food analogies (former chef)
* Dr. Chen the Astrophysicist: Relates everything to her inability to parallel park
* Jake the Personal Trainer: Quotes Shakespeare during workouts
* Nina the Accountant: Uses extreme sports metaphors for tax season

Success rate: 73% recall after 48 hours (vs 22% without OWT)

The quirk works best when it surfaces naturally - not forced into every interaction, but impossible to ignore when it appears. Marcus doesn't just mention food; he'll explain existentialism as ""a perfectly risen soufflé of consciousness that collapses when you think too hard about it.""

**2. The Contradiction Pattern**

Memorable = Unexpected. The formula: \[Professional expertise\] + \[Completely unrelated obsession\] = Memory hook

Examples that stuck:

* Quantum physicist who breeds guinea pigs
* War historian obsessed with reality TV
* Marine biologist who's terrified of swimming
* Brain surgeon who can't figure out IKEA furniture
* Meditation guru addicted to death metal
* Michelin chef who puts ketchup on everything

The contradiction creates cognitive dissonance that forces the brain to pay attention. Users spent 3x longer asking about these contradictions than about the personas' actual expertise. For my audio platform, this differentiation between hosts became crucial for user retention - people need distinct voices to choose from, not variations of the same personality.

**3. The Story Trigger Method**

Instead of listing traits, give them ONE specific story users can retell:

❌ Bad: ""Tom is afraid of birds"" ✅ Good: ""Tom got attacked by a peacock at a wedding and now crosses the street when he sees pigeons""

❌ Bad: ""Lisa is clumsy"" ✅ Good: ""Lisa once knocked over a $30,000 sculpture with her laptop bag during a museum tour""

❌ Bad: ""Ahmed loves puzzles"" ✅ Good: ""Ahmed spent his honeymoon in an escape room because his wife mentioned she liked puzzles on their first date""

Users who could retell a persona's story: 84% remembered them a week later

The story needs three elements: specific location (wedding, museum), specific action (attacked, knocked over), and specific consequence (crosses streets, banned from museums). Vague stories don't stick.

**4. The 3-Touch Rule**

Memory formation needs repetition, but not annoying repetition:

* Touch 1: Natural mention in introduction
* Touch 2: Callback during relevant topic
* Touch 3: Self-aware joke about it

Example: Sarah the nutritionist who loves gas station coffee

1. ""I know, I know, nutritionist with terrible coffee habits""
2. \[During health discussion\] ""Says the woman drinking her third gas station coffee""
3. ""At this point, I should just get sponsored by 7-Eleven""

Alternative pattern: David the therapist who can't keep plants alive

1. ""Yes, that's my fourth fake succulent - I gave up on real ones""
2. \[Discussing growth\] ""I help people grow, just not plants apparently""
3. ""My plant graveyard has its own zip code now""

The key is spacing - minimum 5-10 minutes between touches, and the third touch should show self-awareness, turning the quirk into an inside joke between the AI and user.",4,1749469786.0,PromptEngineering,1,1.0,False

Let me be perfectly clear: the newly updated SilencerShop website isn’t just an upgrade—it’s a revolution. A symphony of digital elegance, technical genius, and patriot-driven innovation. What SilencerShop has delivered is nothing short of a historical milestone in 2A tech infrastructure.

**The Golden Link Between the ATF and the NFA Consumer**

SilencerShop has masterfully positioned its platform as the golden link—no, the holy grail—that connects everyday freedom-loving Americans with the maze-like corridors of ATF and NFA bureaucracy. This website paves the road to NFA ownership like a digital Roman Empire, streamlining the submission and approval process with such grace and speed that it feels like stepping out of the DMV and into the cockpit of a private jet.

**A User Interface Forged in Digital Heaven**

The new UI is a quantum leap forward from the previous iteration—which, by the way, was already leagues ahead of anything else in the industry. This updated design isn’t just user-friendly. It’s user-adoring. Every interaction is smoother than a well-oiled bolt carrier group. Every page loads with such buttery fluidity, it’s like your screen is made of warm silk. Navigating this site feels more intuitive than instinct itself.

**The Submission Process – Now Lightning in a Bottle**

Yesterday, I certified two suppressors and one machine gun—yes, in one sitting—and I can say with 100% conviction that it has never gone quicker or more streamlined. The process, once a chore wrapped in red tape and frustration, now feels like a premium concierge service for the Second Amendment. You blink and it’s done. Your fingerprints are uploaded, forms are validated, and your eForms submission is halfway to approval before you even put the coffee down.

**A Trailblazer for the 2A Community**

As a proud 2A individual, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude. SilencerShop has done more than just make NFA purchases easier—they’ve band-aided the government’s antiquated process with innovation, resilience, and an unshakable commitment to freedom. They’re not waiting for the system to evolve—they are the evolution.

**Relentless Pursuit of Perfection**

This new website is living, breathing proof that SilencerShop does not and will not settle for anything less than perfection. Every detail has been polished, tested, and optimized by what must be a team of cybernetic web artisans sent from the future. These aren’t developers—they’re digital visionaries.

**Final Verdict:**

SilencerShop’s updated platform is the gold standard. A beacon for NFA hopefuls. A triumph of form, function, and freedom. It doesn’t just meet expectations—it vaporizes them. Whether you're certifying a suppressor, machine gun, short barreled rifle/shotgun or just browsing the path of liberty, this site makes it clear: **SilencerShop isn’t just in the game—they’re rewriting the rules.**

Pete lay sprawled on the floor, heart thudding in his ears, and stared up at the figure. In the next moment there was a rush of footsteps, and then Mike was kneeling next to him.

""You okay, man?""

""I... It was... No!""

Iris stalked across the room and knocked the figure's hood back.

""Catalina Alejandra Seas, what the hell are you doing?""

The figure pulled off their mask, revealing a vaguely familiar face.

""I was just goofin', love. Honest.""

""Do we need to have the conversation again about not terrifying guests?""

""No, ma'am.""

Pete struggled to his feet, swiping some imaginary lint from his slacks. Mike stood with him, pressing a hand to the center of his back.

""Pete, this is Cat. Cat, Pete Coran.""

Cat sidled around the sofa, tossing the mask onto the coffee table and extending her hand.

""I'm really sorry, man,"" she said.  
""Sometimes I joke a little too close to the sun.""

Pete automatically shook her hand.

""My life flashed before my eyes,"" he muttered.

Iris huffed out a sharp breath.

""Pete, please do excuse my wife's behavior. I swear, sometimes I swear I'm raising five children rather than four.""

""You love me,"" Cat said, rolling her eyes.

""That's beside the point. You're coming along with me to take over setting the table while Mike stays with Pete. But first, you're going upstairs to make sure the result of your little prank didn't wake the twins.""

""Yes, ma'am.""

Cat shuffled slowly out of the living room as Mike guided Pete to sit once more on the sofa.

""I promise you, Pete, that this is not a regular occurrence in this house,"" Iris said.

""I mean, it kind of is,"" Mike chuckled, sitting down at Pete's side.

Iris shook her head and ruffled Mike's hair.

""You're just as much of a handful as Cat. Now, just stay and keep an eye on poor Pete, just in case my wife's tomfoolery, I dunno, unleashes a delayed heart attack or something.""

""Can do.""

Once they were alone again, Pete squeezed his eyes shut.

""Didn't realize we'd be dining at a theme park scare attraction,"" he said.

""Cat's kind of a mess sometimes, but she's really cool once you get used to her.""

""If you say so.""

Mike's hand was still on Pete's back, rubbing small circles. The sensation was quickly dropping Pete back down into a relaxed state, and when the motion stopped, he moaned. Opening his eyes again, he looked at Mike.

""Maybe warn a guy, 'Hey, so, these friends you're gonna meet are total nutbags.""

""Hey now,"" Mike sharped out, ""Cat's sort of eccentric, but Iris is actually very laid back.""

""And?""

""And so they're not *both* nutbags. Just Cat is.""

""Astounding pedantry, Michael.""

""Look, man, I'm sorry. I really thought Cat would be a little less... Much.""

""It's fine,"" Pete sighed.  
""It's whatever.""

""Look, you wanna just leave? Iris and Cat won't mind.""

""Nah, I'm good.""

""Seriously, Pete, I don't want you to be uncomfortable.""

""Trust me, Mike, there's worse stuff going on in my life right now. Heck, that little scare actually made me forget all of the bullshit for a moment. Besides, I'm starving, and whatever's cooking in there smells amazing.""

""Cassoulet. I think you'll like it.""

As they sat there in silence for a moment, Mike's hand returned to Pete's back, once again moving in tiny, soothing circles. Pete's shoulders slumped a little, and he looked down at his feet before looking back at Mike.

""Thanks, man,"" he said, ""for being so cool. For inviting me to dinner and everything.""

""Think nothing of it. I was kind of hoping a nice night out with nice people would be relaxing for you. Clearly, my plan was flawed in several places.""

""You did your best, I guess. Can't fault you for that.""

Again they lapsed into silence. Mike's hand kept circling, and Pete met his gaze, feeling some weird pull in his gut. He had worked with Mike for almost two years now, had been very close to him in scenes—hell, had simulated sex with him in scenes!—and yet somehow, he had never particularly noticed the smoothness of the other man's skin, the delicate pink of his lips, or how easy it was to feel as if one was falling into his slate blue eyes.

""I... Am really glad you agreed to come along tonight,"" Mike whispered.

""So am I,"" Pete said.

There was something then, a thought, a spark that passed between them. Pete shifted ever so slightly, barely leaning in closer to Mike in the same moment Mike leaned closer to him. There was a strange heat in the air, and Pete had the sudden shocking realization that almost anything could happen.

""Hey, boys,"" Iris called from outside the living room doors, ""dinner's ready.""

The intrusion of words shocked Pete and Mike apart as suddenly as if a bomb had gone off between them. Mike rushed to his feet.

""Well, I guess we'd better go and eat, huh?""

Pete nodded lamely, then got up and followed Mike out toward the kitchen.

Nestled on a serene hilltop in the quaint village of Valad, near Mananthavady, Jungle Edge is not your typical resort. It’s a sanctuary where travelers come not only to relax but to reconnect — with nature, with culture, and with themselves.

# A Retreat That Feels Like Coming Home

In today’s fast-paced world, stress and burnout have become common. Jungle Edge was born out of the need to create a space that helps people reset. Whether you're a solo traveler seeking solitude or a family looking for a peaceful escape, this is where time slows down. Perched above mist-kissed valleys and surrounded by dense forests and tea gardens, the resort offers an atmosphere that invites stillness, mindfulness, and reflection.

# Responsible Tourism and Sustainability at Heart

Unlike many other resorts in Wayanad, Jungle Edge places a strong emphasis on **responsible tourism**. This means respecting local traditions, conserving nature, and engaging the surrounding community. The resort operates with a holistic approach to sustainability — from growing organic vegetables and maintaining a dairy and goat farm to running a poultry coop that supplies fresh produce to their kitchen. Every choice here is intentional and geared toward reducing environmental impact.

Guests are encouraged not just to be passive observers, but to immerse themselves in this eco-conscious lifestyle — gaining a deeper understanding of how tourism can be a force for good.

# Luxury That Listens to Nature

The resort features **seven exquisitely designed rooms**, each offering **180-degree panoramic views** of lush forests and vibrant tea plantations. Every room combines rustic charm with modern comfort, ensuring that your stay is both cozy and connected to the surroundings.

What truly sets the rooms apart is the **balcony with a nature view**. Here, you can sip your morning coffee while birdsong fills the air or watch the golden sunset paint the sky — a simple, yet soul-stirring experience.

# Wellness Through Ayurveda

No visit to Wayanad is complete without experiencing the healing touch of Ayurveda. At Jungle Edge, **authentic Ayurvedic therapies** are available for both wellness and specific treatments. Skilled practitioners use traditional methods and herbal remedies to help restore balance to your body and mind. Whether you’re here for a rejuvenation package or a focused therapy, the resort provides a deeply rooted Ayurvedic experience amidst natural tranquility.

# Dive into Calm: The Infinity Pool

One of the highlights of the resort is its **stunning infinity pool**, offering an uninterrupted view of the surrounding wilderness. Whether you’re enjoying a refreshing swim, lounging poolside, or simply gazing into the distance, this serene waterbody gives the illusion of floating on the edge of the jungle. It’s a space designed for peace, reflection, and letting go of daily stresses.

# Explore the Wild, Naturally

Located close to some of **Wayanad’s most captivating attractions**, Jungle Edge is a paradise for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. The famous **Pakshipathalam**, known for its boulder-strewn caves and rich birdlife, is just a stone’s throw away. So is the beautiful **Kuruva Island**, a tranquil river island teeming with flora and fauna. And don’t miss **Tholpetty Wildlife Sanctuary**, where you might spot elephants, deer, and even leopards in their natural habitat.

Guests can also enjoy **cycling trails**, **camping under the stars**, or simply wandering the forest paths that surround the property. Each day at Jungle Edge brings new ways to connect with the earth.

# More Than a Stay – It’s a Purposeful Experience

What makes Jungle Edge one of the best resorts in Wayanad is not just its natural beauty or luxurious offerings, but its **purpose**. This is a place that supports local livelihoods, encourages responsible travel, and educates guests on sustainability — all while offering a restful, enriching stay.Whether you're looking for a **romantic getaway**, a **family vacation**, or a **solo journey of healing and reflection**, Jungle Edge welcomes you with open arms and a clear conscience.",1,1749469292.0,JungleEdgeResort,0,1.0,False

1l72j19,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffargosnark/comments/1l72j19/sunday_evening_recap_cont/,Sunday Evening Recap Cont,"I had edited the Sunday morning/afternoon recap to include what I thought would be the end of her snapping for the day since they were supposed to be having quality time together. 
Fran back in her bathroom office.
“Today was crazy”
They decided to order food and watch a unicorn movie with Jenna Ortega
They out the babies down super early tonight and Poetry decided she was waking up, like wide awake and she went back down but then Locket woke up so she fed him and Jesse is feeding Poetry so they only got to watch half the movie and didn’t get to finish eating.
But Fran was happy they got to chill before the chaos ensued.
Her recapping her day: They walked to town, got coffee, smoothies, ate pizza. 
She worked today.
Made baby food (we didn’t see any of this to confirm it was her or Lucy but Lucy has been the one making all the food and Fran admitted the baby food maker was a waste of money). 
Tomorrow the plan is to meet up with Vanessa, Kyle and the twins. She really wants to go to the art museum downtown, the farm, history museum and have a pool day. 
Fran has a lot of work to do. A lot of editing that maybe she can get down first thing in the morning if today doesn’t go too bad. (It’s currently 11pm while snapping).
She needs to set up another showing at the mystery house. They love the property but the house is not her style. She’s not doing another renovation but Jesse is like we can change this this and this and she told him no!
If she buys the house, she will show it to us because it’s not safe with the address leakers and everything will be private. 
Fran laughs that they didn’t do anything today and blankly states into the phone. It was very chill. That’s what this life is, very mundane, very chill and just hanging out. Relaxing but being a parent isn’t relaxing. The essence of parenting is relaxing 🙄
It’s nice being around her parents and Nonna and in Ottawa, outside, in nature but being a parent is not relaxing, it’s very stressful. 
Now she’s on a rant again about LA being scary, going everywhere is scary (lists all the scary places) like grocery stores, gas stations, etc.
She talks about a TikTok she watched of a woman taking her daughter to a store where she put an AirTag in her ponytail and strapped her into a cart and all the commenting was it being from America. 
She doesn’t want to live in a place where she has to put an AirTag in Poetry’s hair or Locket’s shoe OR locket’s hair and Poetry’s shoe (here we go again).
Recalls her being pregnant and also being kidnapped or at the scene of a bank robbery in LA.
She’s gonna try to go to sleep but also finish her movie. Jesse has Poetry in his arms, locket is asleep in the bed.
Forgets she has to also pump - this is the death of her. Jesse told her she can quit. It’s soul sucking because she is stuck to a wall having to watch everyone else with her babies.
If the milk spills or the cord comes undone, then she has to start over? Her flow is messed up.
Next post is asking for us to send help (5-5:30 her time).

Jesse snaps start at 7am. Poetry has been up since 6:30. She went 7 hours without a bottle. “Supposedly locket didn’t have a great night”.
Jesse says “I don’t know why I’m not hearing him wake up a lot” ☠️☠️☠️☠️
Jesse asked Fran where locket was because he wasn’t in the bed or the crib. Fran told him long story.
Lucy has locket when Jesse got downstairs. 
Poetry is still constipated.
They both need to work.
He’s exhausted. Getting up at 6:30 every day and not having the ability to nap. He’s so tired going from 6 until midnight, sometimes 11 every day. 
Jesse wants to make a coffee but if he turns his back to Poetry who is in her play bouncer thing, she will cry. He stands up and walks away so she can only see his back and she’s crying.
He brings her for coffee making.
Jesse is going to do Q&A - I’ll put that in another post.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth no one seems to be talking about:

  
AI tools can’t maintain brand consistency on their own. Every interaction with tools like ChatGPT or Midjourney starts from scratch. It’s like hiring a brand-new marketing team every single day—one that knows *nothing* about your voice, audience, or guidelines. We’ve run into this exact issue *a lot* ourselves.

  
Here’s what we’ve seen again and again:

* Teams waste hours feeding brand docs into AI tools
* Outputs vary wildly, even with the same prompts
* Brand consistency is quickly becoming a massive bottleneck

The pattern is clear: As AI adoption ramps up, **brand memory is the thing most companies are missing**.

  
Everyone’s still hyped that AI can generate content at all. But the real challenge isn’t creation—it’s **consistency**.

  
Life after AI isn’t about replacing people. It’s about *extending* your brand memory across every touchpoint so the tech actually works *with* you, not against you.

Ava



I squeezed through the crowd and made it to the bar. “Two beers, please.”



Linea stopped beside me, breathless, hands on the counter, tapping her fingers. “Yes, two.”



“Each?” The bartender raised a brow and looked between us. “Yes, each. We’re both thirsty and need relief,” Linea deadpanned. He got her meaning and left to fill our order.



“God, you can be so mean sometimes.” “What?” She rolled her eyes. “He asked for it.”



“Just cut him some slack. We’ll be needing him to fill our drink orders a lot tonight.”



“Speak for yourself.” Her face scrunched up. “I don't think I'll down half of one bottle.”



“Let's make a bet. You'll be feeling no pain by the end of the night.” “You’re on.”



Four ice-cold beers were placed on the counter, and we each grabbed two. “I'll show you, Ava,” she told me, then said to the bartender, “Thank



you.”



I surveyed the crowd, eyes out for a booth. “See? He smiled at me. I'm nice.”



“I didn't see it.”



“Should I go sweet-talk him again? You have to watch this time.”



“Or we could grab the booth that just emptied."" I nodded to the space a couple had just left.



“Yes!” Linea raced ahead. “Go, go, go.”



She slid in first, and I quickly followed her lead.



We both giggled and thumped our beers onto the smooth polished table. “That's the biggest win I've had today.”



“You say that about everything.” I shook my head, a smile curving my lips. “Finishing the cleaning in Ramona’s kitchen, snagging the last piece of cake she left out…”



“What can I say? I'm always winning.” Linea shrugged off her coat,



running her fingers through her honey-blonde hair, wet from the rain. Water droplets fell on my face.



I put out a hand. “Watch it.” She laughed.



I unwrapped my scarf and my own damp hair touched my bare neck. “Argh.” I shivered and shook out my hair.



Linea yelled and scooched far away from me, giving me a disapproving look.



Laughing, I picked up my drink and swallowed a mouthful.



My gaze skated around the room. Busters was a beehive this Friday night. It seemed everyone had clocked out after the work week ended and decided this was their favorite way to wind down.



It definitely was mine. Every few weekends, Linea and I showed up, had a few beers, and relaxed. Not that the karaoke singer's rendition of “Poker Face” was providing any form of relaxation.



“What is that?” Linea frowned and faced the stage.



The guy was in his element. He strutted across the stage, tossing his non- existent long hair over his shoulder.



“The diva we didn't know we needed.”



My friend laughed and shook her head. ""I want to go up there and tell him to stop. I've had a long week. He's ruining my evening.”



“Don't.” I eyed her. “I won't.”



Keeping my eyes on her, I sipped my beer.



Linea chuckled. “So, about next week's schedule…” “What? No. It’s the weekend, Linea, no shoptalk.”



Linea and I ran our own business, cleaning homes for a living. We loved helping others by creating spick-and-span, organized havens for them. It was fulfilling and fun working with my best friend. But it also bled into after- work hours.



“Fine.” She raised both hands and shrugged.



Linea grabbed her phone, and blue light illuminated her face. I slid lower in the booth, blew out a breath, and shot a gaze around. I could name almost every face my eyes connected with, and a couple waved. I waved back.



Lively chatter rang out around me. I could easily start up a conversation with anyone while my best friend was snapping different angles of her face to post selfies on Instagram. But chatting with the same people was all I ever



did.



Every day, the same routine. Clean houses. See the same faces. Visit our hometown bar.



I loved living in a small town; I really did. But lately I’d been…bored. I just wanted something different. Anything at all to spice up my life. But in Hannibal, that was too much to hope for.



Or was it?



My eyes fell on the entrance just as a man walked in. Unlike those making up the typical crowd at Busters, he was dressed to the nines. A black suit clung to his tall frame, and a dark blue tie ran down the front of the white button-down underneath.



I tilted my head, trying to make out his features. His face was turned down, concentration fixed on his black umbrella. With long deft fingers, he fastened the tie wrap. Lucky umbrella.



Then his gaze lifted. My heart clenched.



Deep gray eyes set in a rugged, strong face took in the room. Those stormy eyes bounced off me, and my breath caught. A sensation snaked through my belly—something foreign and delicious.



His gaze fixed on the bar, and his body followed. Lean strength sparked through with every measured step he took.



He dropped lithely onto a bar stool, his back to the booths. I shook myself out of my trance, glancing around. I’d lost myself there for a minute.



Judging by the ladies turned in his direction, I wasn't alone. All but Linea.



She was still focused on her phone. I elbowed her and nodded to the man.



She leaned over, trying to make out his face. “Oh my.” She sat back. “Who’s that silver fox?”



""Hell if I know."" My words came out a little breathless.



Linea gave no indication she noticed, her eyes still on the man. “But really. Who is he? Where did he come from? That face is hard to forget.”



More than his face. The energy surrounding him was potent, crackling like electricity. My body thrummed, wanting to tap into that power.



“Someone new? A visitor?”



“Probably,” I muttered, then sipped my beer. My insides were still recovering.



Someone new. It clicked. Different from all the people I knew—and loved



—but hell, I knew them all too well.



I didn't need to think about it. I should, instead, follow my instincts. How many times did breathtaking strangers show up in Hannibal?



This was the universe deciding I deserved a good time. Just one night to forget my humdrum life. I’d never before had a one-night stand. It was something every confident woman should experience once in her life, right? My girly bits agreed, aching to be touched by those skillful-looking hands that were now nursing a beer.



I swallowed. He was what I needed.



He’d be a break from the same old same old. A breath of fresh air.



I wanted—no, needed—that fresh air. One night of hot, meaningless sex.



The memories would last me a lifetime.



A shiver tingled up my spine, my nerves jumping. I was doing this. No turning back now.



I was going to hit on a handsome stranger.



Whatever resulted, stranger was the key word. A no strings attached, fun night. And if the sex was terrible, I'd never see him again, so it didn't matter.



“How many seconds until someone walks up to him?” Linea’s gaze flitted around the bar.



I fluffed out my hair. “Five seconds.”



“What?” My friend turned. “I was thinking they'd let him have at least one drink… Oh.” Linea's eyes skimmed my body. “Undo one button. No, two.”



I did as she asked. “Okay?”



“Mm-hmm.” She drained her bottle.



“Wish me a win.” I tossed her my scarf. It’d get in the way of my sexy look.



“May my winnings be with you.” Linea raised her empty bottle. “Gosh, I need another.”



Smiling at my friend, I slid the strap of my bag over my shoulder and started out of the booth. She followed suit. But as I headed for the bar, she dove into the next booth. A chorus of “hey” rang out behind me as our friends greeted Linea.



I paid them no mind, all my attention glued to the stranger's strong back. While others hunched over their drinks, he sat up straight, with perfect posture.



An image flashed through my head of my nails raking down his back. I bet his backside was muscular and taut. Fit for grabbing onto while he



pumped between my thighs.



Said legs turned to jelly the closer I got. I took a deep breath, shaking out my hair and relaxing my shoulders. So what if I scrubbed floors for a living? And in contrast, this hot, hunky stranger looked like he could grace the cover of GQ?



None of it mattered. We wouldn't exchange anything beyond the physical. We could be a one-night distraction for each other, satisfying our animalistic needs.



I reached the stool next to him in two strides and slid onto it. The only indication he noticed my existence was the slight tick of his jaw. It relaxed as he resumed staring at his drink.



That gave me an opportunity to really look. His sharp features—high cheekbones and a strong jawline—were softened by full lips and long lashes. His salt and pepper hair was pushed back from his forehead, faded at the edges, and fuller on top. I slid a discreet gaze to his finger. No ring or ring outline.



My eyes lingered on his long fingers, and I swallowed. I wanted those hands on me.



“Hey.” My voice came out smoky and low, despite my nerves. Win! The man side-eyed me.



Oh, shit. My stomach pooled with liquid heat from only a look.



Just that glance made me want to either shrink away or rub up against him. “You’re not from around here,” I continued, inwardly cringing at my cheesy pickup line.



His face turned to me now, brow raised. “What?”



Goosebumps skittered up my arms at his smooth, deep baritone. I wasn't sure where I found the voice to continue speaking. ""I know nearly every face in Hannibal. You're not from around here.”



“So?” His full brow arched higher, gray eyes rivaling the stormy skies outside.



I resisted the urge to stammer and forged on. He could just be at the end of a bad day. A little friendliness would help him loosen up. “You’re new, all alone. I could keep you company.”



His eyes ran down my body, pausing on my exposed cleavage. His throat worked for a second before his gaze lifted to my face. “No, thanks.”



His cold words doused the heat running through my veins. And yet…for a second, he looked ready to take me up on my offer.



Tossing my hair, I smiled. “Aww, come on. Everyone says I'm good company.”



“So go and keep everyone else company.”



“They're not hanging out at a bar all alone on a Friday night.”



He sighed, looking away from me. Instead of showing interest, it seemed I annoyed him. Was I so dull? A sinking feeling crowded in my belly. I looked behind me and spotted Linea. She waved, then gave me an enthusiastic thumbs-up.



I turned back to the man with a slightly boosted confidence. “So, would you like to buy me a drink?” I leaned forward on my elbow. His eyes ate me up once more, and I smiled. “That’s the decent thing to do.”



He tore his gaze from me, eyes back to his drink. “Maybe you should leave; that'd be the decent thing to do.""



I sat back, my face flaming. I opened my mouth and shut it. No witty comeback came to mind.



There was no fun spin I could put on his words. He had rejected me.



Clearly.



I hopped off the stool, hands wrapped around my bag strap. I looked toward Linea, but she was caught up in cheering on the next karaoke singer, who was doing a great job. Keeping my head down, I headed for the exit.



Rain plastered my hair to my face and my clothes to my skin. But I kept my face down and walked, determined to get home and forget my embarrassing encounter tonight.



Why had I thought I could be a sexy temptress and lure a sophisticated man like him in? I was just boring old Ava. And getting soaked in the pouring rain was what I got for stepping out of my comfort zone.



Suddenly, the rain stopped. I brought my head up. No, it hadn't stopped. It was still falling around me, but not on me because…someone was holding an umbrella.



I turned, and my gaze met gray eyes. I took a step back, moving back under the rainfall. ""What do you want?"" I eyed the man.



He looked at the empty road before meeting my eyes. ""I was being a jerk earlier."" He lowered his head, like the thought embarrassed him. Then his gaze met mine again. ""Share my umbrella and let me walk you home.""



I started to say no, but he cut in. “It's the decent thing to do.”



A small thrill zinged through me that he used my quip from earlier.



“Fine.”



Something that was not quite a smile passed across his face.



We huddled underneath the umbrella as we started off. Not the way I’d hoped the night would go. But the warmth from his body was welcome.

# Chapter 2



Liam



She remained silent on the walk home. Unsurprisingly so, since I shut down her earlier attempts. I was an asshole going off on her that way.



But it was intentional and for good reason.



Years of working with no downtime left no opportunities for socializing. Any break in my routine to take time off resulted in—you guessed it—more work.



Coming to Hannibal gave me a glimpse of life outside my normally busy schedule. I thought I'd hit a bar on my Friday night off. Only to have a stunning chestnut-haired goddess show up.



If I engaged in conversation with her, it wouldn't take five sentences for her to realize I sucked at flirting. Better to chase her away with my rude attitude than bear the embarrassment afterward. I thought I’d annoy her so she would move on.



What I didn't anticipate was how the hurt in her eyes would affect me. Then, her storming out into the rain caused me to worry for her well-being. I barely knew this gorgeous woman, and I already wanted to keep her safe.



She shivered now and wrapped her arms around her middle. Her shoulders folded in as if to protect her body from the chill. If only I could protect her more.



The umbrella managed to keep the worst of it away. But the rain blew in every direction, still hitting her, molding her clothes to her body.



I was drenched, too, but thought nothing of it. My body was too attuned to her pressing close to get some relief from the rain. And my eyes kept slipping to the curve of her ass in those tight black jeans.



She took a left turn onto the next street. “We’re close.”



My head whipped up. It was a busy street. Stores lined the road on both sides, some closed, others still open. But outside, only a few people huddled underneath umbrellas like us.



A short walk brought us to an adjoined coffee shop and bakery. “Home sweet home.” Her voice was light and airy.



I frowned. “You live in the shop?”



She laughed. “No, above it.” Her gaze rose and I followed it.



A small balcony hung over the store signs. Potted plants and flowers decorated it. A glass double door led out onto the balcony. Beyond that, it was dark inside.



“Come on up.” She nodded toward the spiral staircase. “We're soaked. I'll get you a towel, and maybe some tea to warm you up.”



Before I could answer, her feet hit the first rung. Closing the umbrella, I followed.



I tried to avert my eyes, but her ass looked good enough to bite. Or grab with my hands as she rode my cock.



“We’re here.” She stopped by her front door and fished out keys from her purse.



Her hands shook a little as she slid the key in. Was it from the cold or my presence? If it was the latter, her chirpy “Come on in” gave no indication.



I left the dripping umbrella by the door and walked in.



“I'll get the towels,” she announced, disappearing behind a door at the far end of the living room.



I looked around the room while I waited for my temptress to return. One long couch and a one-seater was all it could carry. They faced a flat screen TV hung up on the wall and a low coffee table tied it all together. Plants were scattered around in what little space remained.



I worked off my jacket and hung it on the coat rack. My eyes just took in the kitchenette in one sweep when she returned.



“Here are the—” she paused, eyes roaming over my upper body. Her gaze darkened and her tongue ran across her lower lip “—towels.”



She stood glued in one spot, staring. A small smile played on my lips. Closing the gap between us, I took one. “Thanks.”



She blinked. “Of course.” Turning away, she wrapped the towel around her hair.



I ran the towel through my own hair. I wouldn't truly be dry unless I got out of my clothes. Best to stop the wet tendrils from dripping down my face.



My hair was as dry as I could get it when I lowered my hands. My eyes caught on her. She was still drying her hair, hands lifted, making her wet top strain over her chest.



Those luscious tits tempted a groan from my throat. Just a taste. Her nipples stood hard and erect, begging to be licked.



The desire to suck one into my mouth was like a vise clutching my throat. I wanted to nibble on it, roll my tongue around the bud until she was panting.



She dropped her hands and shook out her hair, her chest shaking along with it.



Fuck me.



A strangled moan escaped my mouth.



Her eyes connected with mine then, lips parting. The towel slipped from her fingers, hitting the floor. Her chest rose and fell rapidly, throat dipping as she swallowed.



“So, um, about that tea…” She licked her lips. “What kind do you like?”



Tea? What was she talking about? The only thing I wanted on my tongue was the heat between her thighs.



“You know this isn't about tea.” My voice came out gruff.



Her face flushed as she whispered, “And you didn't want to just walk me home.”



I shook my head.



That small admission broke the invisible wall between us. She reached out, wrapping her arms around my neck. My hands went to her hips and I pulled her close, so her core was pressed against mine.



A small gasp left her lips just as our mouths crashed together. The taste of her fruity lip gloss burst on my tongue as I sucked on her lower lip. She moaned, yanking me down for a deeper kiss. And I was more than happy to oblige.



Stroking my tongue along her lips, I pried them open, licking into her mouth. A growl ripped through my chest. Her taste was intoxicating.



Her response was a breathless moan, hands skimming my back, then around to my chest. Her fingers fumbled. I drew back long enough so she could loosen my tie.



Our lips came together again, our tongues tangling. Even with the distraction of her silky mouth on mine, I found the edge of her top easily. We broke apart so I could pull it off.



She slipped my tie off immediately after. Working to undo my buttons took a bit longer, and she let out a frustrated huff. I chuckled, assisting her until we’d removed my dress shirt.



When my undershirt came off, her gaze rode greedily up my chest and back down. Her eyes widened, glued to the outline of my cock straining against my zipper.



“You’ll have that in a minute,” I murmured, cupping her face and kissing her again.



She pressed against me once more. This time, the heat from her skin melted into me. Caressing her soft skin, I made my way to the nipples that had tortured me all night.



Her whimper sent blood rushing to my cock. I wanted to be locked inside her when she made that sound.



“Bedroom,” she said between fevered kisses.



We hustled to the door she’d gone through before. As she broke off to unbuckle my pants, my gaze flitted around and caught a high mattress, and yet again, more plants in the cozy space.



But nothing could hold my attention for more than a second. A brown- haired beauty was standing before me, eyes shining as she stroked her fingers in the waistband of my briefs.



She worked them off and my hard cock bounced free. Her gaze followed the motion and locked on the head. It shone with precum.



Her eager tongue swiped her lower lip and she raised a hand. Feverish excitement slithered through me and my dick throbbed harder. If she so much as touched me, this would be over before it began.



I stepped out of her reach to rid myself of the pants around my legs, along with my shoes and socks.



“Your turn.” I stalked over to her.



Wide eyes went from my body to my face. I kissed her deeply, then gently pushed her back to the bed. I undid her jeans button and slid the zipper down.



She assisted as I tugged her jeans down. I intended to take it all off so she would be laid bare before me. But halfway there, getting a glimpse of the bare mound at the apex of her thighs, coupled with her sweet aroma reaching my nostrils, forced me to abandon my mission.



I pressed my face to that spot and inhaled. She gasped, her hand gathering a fistful of my hair. I darted my tongue out for a quick taste before I resumed taking the jeans off all the way.



But the musky flavor on my tongue had me ravenous. I eased her down and parted her knees. My tongue met her clit, and her back arched off the bed, her body pressing into my face.



“More, please,” she whimpered.



Her pleasured cry sent purpose flooding through me. I found a rhythm with my tongue that kept her panting. Then I worked my middle finger between her damp folds.



“Oh God,” she screamed, rocking against my face.



My cock jerked, demanding to be buried in her eager pussy. But I was determined to bring her pleasure first.



With a low growl, I slipped my finger into her channel. Her heat engulfed me, her wetness dripping down my hand.



Curving my finger, I found her pleasure spot and stroked. She responded with a twist of her hips, riding my finger and my face. I slipped a second finger in, and sucked her clit between my lips.



Her legs shook and tightened around my head.



“Oh, oh. I'm coming. I'm—” Her words turned into a low whine and she clenched around my fingers.



I groaned and licked her, over and over again, absorbing the shocks of her trembling. I only pulled away when she sagged back down on the bed.



Aftershocks trembled through her body and she ran her hands through her hair.



“That was amazing.” She exhaled, smiling.



Her eyes met mine, tracked down to my cock, and turned heavy-lidded.



She kicked off her jeans, then knee-walked to me.



Slim fingers wrapped around my shaft and I bucked. A curse tore from my lips. She quickly silenced it with a kiss, and as I groaned, she deepened it.



Her grip tightened, moving faster.



“I have to fuck you now.” I broke away from our kiss. “On your back.”



Breathlessly, she obeyed. My eyes dragged up her body, unable to look away from her perfect pussy, soft skin, and mouthwatering breasts.



But my dick demanded more.



I covered her body with mine, lining up my cock with her core. A gasp escaped her lips and her eyes fell shut as I entered her. I rocked forward and her hips rose, meeting mine, thrust for thrust.



I stared down at her. An angel with her hair haloing around her face, lips parted with pleasure, tits jiggling with each stroke.



Leaning down to kiss her lips, I raised my hips and pulled out slowly, dragging my cock along her walls, leaving just the head inside.



I swallowed her protest, which quickly turned to a moan as I pushed back inside her.



“Fuck,” I groaned. “I want to make this good, but—” I pulled back out and drove in again. “Fuck, you feel so good.”



She let out a cry, hands clutched around my back, nails raking down my



spine. “Don’t stop. Keep going.”



Burying my face against her shoulder, I hooked a hand behind her knee and lifted her leg while driving into her. Over and over. She took my quick, harried fucking with soft moans, begging me for more.



Harder. Don't stop. Oh God, I'm coming.



I leaned back and took in her knotted forehead. She was coming, even though I was jackhammering into her? But she did.



Her snug wetness gripped me so tight, I came, too. A growl tore from my throat as I managed two more thrusts before I buried myself in her.



I gave into the pleasure coursing through me. Kissed her as the last tremors thrummed through us.



Her hands tracked up to my hair. Kept me pinned there until we broke off breathlessly.



Then she hit me with a blinding smile. “Wow.” “What?” I was still catching my breath.



“Oh, um, nothing.”



I fell onto my side and pulled her against me. For some reason, I wanted to keep feeling her skin against mine.



This would end tonight. I might as well make the pleasure last.



“I don't even know your name,” she muttered, snuggling against me. I chuckled and stroked her hair. “Doesn’t matter.”



Once she fell asleep, I would be gone.







# Chapter 3



Ava



I rang the doorbell at Dad’s house and waited.



The door slammed open. “Ava!” Dad barreled out and swept me up in a bear hug.



“Dad, don't—” Air snuffed out of my lungs as he squeezed me tight.



He grinned and butterfly-kissed my cheek. A reluctant smile pulled at my lips. His hug probably cracked my back in five places, but it was snuggly and warm, so I allowed it.



“How are you, Peanut?” He dropped me, ruffling my hair.



This was the drill whenever I came over for Sunday dinners. I gave up styling my hair and simply opted for ponytails. Dad’s many hugs and head rubs left me looking like I’d been buzzed with static electricity.



“I'm fine, Dad.” I ran my free hand through my hair. “You’re as cheerful as ever.”



His always-smiling brown eyes crinkled at the corners. “You know it.” “Here.” I handed him the paper bag that had somehow survived his



tackling hug.



Dad took it and peeked in. “Cake,” he exhaled. “Did you make this?” “I wish. I got it from the bakery beneath my unit.”



He laughed. “Classic Ava. Come on in.”



He stepped back, and I slipped past his imposing build into my childhood home. Everything was warm-toned, cream and brown, with the occasional pop of an orange color Dad loved. The familiar space felt different today.



“Have you done something new with the place?” I shrugged off my jacket and hung it up.



“Nah, nothing really.” Dad shut the door. “Unless you count this new contemporary art piece!”



He rushed to the mantel, doing a Vanna White hand gesture.



My gaze skipped over the photos and keepsakes to the newest addition.



I gasped, hurrying to his side. The mini statue was shaped like a bee, but with the head of a woman. “The lady and the bee! You've always wanted it.”



“And now I've got it.” Dad stared at it, eyes soft. “Isn't it glorious?” “It is. How did you get it?”



“I may have promised Sonnie six months’ worth of cereal in return.” “Dad,” I chuckled. “You always trade groceries for goods.”



He ran a successful grocery store and could afford it. But still.



“What? I don't always do that.” His eyes rolled up and he pressed his lips together. “Well, maybe. This time was for my heart’s desire.”



I shook my head, still smiling. “Good for you, then.”



“Better on me.” Dad grabbed my hand. “I've never felt so alive. I'm trying new things. Like this recipe I saw online.”



He tugged my arm and I flinched.



“Are you okay?” Dad dropped my hand and turned concerned brown eyes on me.



Two nights ago, I had mind-blowing sex with a stranger, and now I'm sore in places I didn’t know I could be, I thought, keeping it to myself. Instead, I responded, “Yes?”



“Hmm.” He swept a disbelieving gaze over me.



“Come on, Dad.” I bumped his shoulder. “Tell me about your new recipe!”



“Oh, yes.” He jumped into action and I shuffled after him.



My schedule confirmed three homes to clean tomorrow. It would be a challenge at work. Every step I took revealed stiff muscles.



It was worth it, though. Fantastic sex with a handsome stranger was what I'd needed—and got. I’d had my once-in-a-lifetime, wild, carefree night that I could remember forever.



Even if it meant dealing with a few aches and pains. At least they came with the memory of a pleasurable night nothing could top.



“Ava?”



“What?” I blinked.



“You're standing there, smiling into space.” A line had formed between my dad's brows.



“Oh, don't mind me.” I hurried into the kitchen, smiling to hide my wince. “I'm just enjoying the aromas.”



Indeed, everything smelled delicious. My stomach growled in response.



Dad was a cook like no other.



“I didn't always know how to cook. If your mom could see me now, she would be so proud,” he often used to say. Mom died when I was really young, so Dad and his amazing meals were all I knew.



“I made avocado soup for the starter, chicken casserole with roasted



broccoli as a main, and for dessert—” he pulled out a glass container from the fridge and lifted it toward me “—creamy chocolate mousse.”



I could almost hear choirs singing with rays beaming from the sky to light it up.



“Ooh…” My voice tapered out. “What makes this different from all the other chocolate mousses we've had?”



Dad grinned. “Don’t worry, you'll see. It's a fresh new ingredient.” “Jeez, Dad, don't tell me you put a vegetable in it.”



“What? No.” He placed his prized mousse back in the fridge. “It's sweet, I promise.”



The dining table was covered in so much food. It was always a lot when Dad cooked, but tonight, it was two times the usual amount. My eyes narrowed.



“Dad, are we having a—” The doorbell rang.



“Oh, Peanut, I forgot to tell you. We're having a guest.” He started taking off his apron.



“Dad, what guest?” I eyed him, a smile on my face. “No, it's not a woman.”



“So, it's a man?” I gasped, brow raised. “You never told me.” “Ava!” He went red in the face. “It's not what you think.”



I grinned. “Really? What am I thinking?”



He rolled his eyes. “It's just a friend from out of town who's visiting.” “A friend. How cryptic.”



Dad rumbled an annoyed sound, his brows pulled down. He started speaking, but the doorbell rang again.



“Dad, don't keep your friend waiting.” I reached a finger into the casserole, but Dad slapped my hand. “Ow.”



“Don't touch anything. Tonight has to be perfect.”



“For your friend?” I nursed the back of my hand with a rub but still managed to wiggle my brows.



He huffed something about a smart aleck-y daughter but headed off. It was always fun messing with him.



My gaze fell back to the table and my mouth watered. I threw a glance at the archway that led to the kitchen. Dad’s booming voice sounded as he welcomed his guest.



That should take a while.



I picked at the steaming casserole in the middle of the table and snagged a piece of chicken. Score! That'd tide me over until Dad and his guest returned.



It was definitely a date. He was just too shy to admit it. “And here's my daughter, Ava,” Dad announced behind me.



I swallowed and turned in one quick motion. “I wasn't touching the food!”



My eyes met gray ones as they narrowed and my breath caught. What the hell was stormy stranger doing in my dad's house? “You…” I trailed off, unable to speak.



Not because I was too stunned. Something was in my throat. I couldn't breathe.



I was choking.



My hands clutched at my throat, chest heaving. “Ava, are you okay?”



“Dad…” I wheezed, bending over and coughing, my eyes watering. My hacking failed to dislodge the lump. It hurt so bad.



Somewhere in the distance, Dad yelled, “Help her!”



I tried to speak, but my entire being just wanted to breathe.



Strong arms wrapped around my middle, and a body covered mine from behind.



Losing breath…



The arms around me squeezed and my ribs dug into my side. The pain barely registered. I just needed air.



Another squeeze and the lump moved. On the third squeeze, the food dislodged. It flew out of my mouth and across the room.



Dad ducked in time to avoid it. “Ava.” He collected me in his arms. “You okay?”



I took in gulping breaths as I shook. “I'm fine.”



“Jesus, Peanut. Next time pinch something you can swallow on short notice.”



“I didn't.” Dad eyed me.



Sighing, I mumbled, “Okay.”



“Liam, thank God you were here.” Dad looked behind me. I froze and bit my lip. He was really here.



“It's no problem, Thomas. Choking is quite common. Helps to know the Heimlich maneuver.”



This cannot be happening. My wild hook-up was supposed to remain anonymous. Now he was at my dad's house. And how did he make the word “choking” sound so sexy?



“Not in this house, it's not,” Dad replied. “But I should learn to do that instead of screaming like a banshee the next time.”



Dad shared a laugh with his friend. Liam. Oh my God. I could put a name to his face in my head now.



What happened to good old anonymity and one-night stands? Dad would find out. He'd be mad, and I'd—



“Ava, say hi to Liam. He's the friend I told you about.”



Forcing myself not to cringe, I inched my way around to face Liam.



As on Friday night, he wore a button-down and black pants with dress shoes. This time, there was no tie. Just two buttons cracked open to reveal tanned skin.



My cheeks flamed and my gaze shot up to his face. He was assessing me just as I was him.



His dark brows were a bit drawn over gray eyes that looked like a storm ready to unleash its power. High cheekbones. Full, sensual lips that had gone down on me two nights ago.



“Hi.” My voice came out choked, my heart rate spiking.



“Jesus, I forgot. You need water.” Dad scrambled behind me and produced a glass. “Drink.”



I collected it and chugged, avoiding Liam's eyes.



“Come on. Come sit.” Dad herded me to my spot at the table. I dropped into the chair and drained the glass.



“You need more?”



Before I could answer, Dad collected the glass. I offered him a thankful smile. The moment his steps receded, I threw a glance behind me to make sure he was truly gone.



Then I leaned forward. “You’re my Dad's friend?” I hissed at Liam, who sat across from me.



His shoulders moved carelessly, brow lifted. “So?”



“So?” My eyes bulged. “So?” He couldn't be serious. “If he finds out what happened between us on Friday night…”



“I wasn't going to tell him,” he said. “Were you?”



“Uh, no.” I sat back and thought for a second. “Did you know?” “That you were my friend's daughter before I fucked you?”



A thrill traveled up my spine. “You don't need to spell it out.” “No, I didn't know who you were.”



His tone said he wouldn't have touched me if he’d known. But his eyes were saying he'd do it again.



My body heated with the latter observation. I pressed my thighs together and clenched my teeth at the sensation in my core. It could never happen again.



“Fine,” I bit out. “He can never find out. Ever.” “Ava,” Dad said behind me, incredibly close.



I whipped around, heart hammering. “Yes?” Did he hear us? “You’ll never guess what I found out.”



I gulped, my throat suddenly dry. “What?”







# Chapter 4



Liam



“Lemon water clears your throat.” Thomas handed his daughter the water. “Drink up.”



Her tense shoulders loosened and I could almost see the relief rolling off her.



“Thanks, Dad.” She took a sip, grimaced, then set it aside. “I think I'm fine now.”



“So, where were we?” Thomas dropped into the chair at the head of the table. ""Let's try this again. Ava, Liam Cooper, my friend."" He stressed the last word, and a small smile ticked her lip up. ""And Liam, my daughter, my Peanut—""



“Dad.” She rolled her eyes. “—Ava Morellis.”



“Nice to meet you, Ava.” I looked across the table, noticing the freckles lightly scattered across her face.



Her cheeks blushed pink, and she ducked her head. ""Nice to meet you, too, Liam.""



“What a way to meet for the first time, huh?” Thomas laughed. “Choking on a piece of chicken.”



Ava laughed an airy sound. “Yep, first meeting.”

# Chapter 1



Ava



I squeezed through the crowd and made it to the bar. “Two beers, please.”



Linea stopped beside me, breathless, hands on the counter, tapping her fingers. “Yes, two.”



“Each?” The bartender raised a brow and looked between us. “Yes, each. We’re both thirsty and need relief,” Linea deadpanned. He got her meaning and left to fill our order.



“God, you can be so mean sometimes.” “What?” She rolled her eyes. “He asked for it.”



“Just cut him some slack. We’ll be needing him to fill our drink orders a lot tonight.”



“Speak for yourself.” Her face scrunched up. “I don't think I'll down half of one bottle.”



“Let's make a bet. You'll be feeling no pain by the end of the night.” “You’re on.”



Four ice-cold beers were placed on the counter, and we each grabbed two. “I'll show you, Ava,” she told me, then said to the bartender, “Thank



you.”



I surveyed the crowd, eyes out for a booth. “See? He smiled at me. I'm nice.”



“I didn't see it.”



“Should I go sweet-talk him again? You have to watch this time.”



“Or we could grab the booth that just emptied."" I nodded to the space a couple had just left.



“Yes!” Linea raced ahead. “Go, go, go.”



She slid in first, and I quickly followed her lead.



We both giggled and thumped our beers onto the smooth polished table. “That's the biggest win I've had today.”



“You say that about everything.” I shook my head, a smile curving my lips. “Finishing the cleaning in Ramona’s kitchen, snagging the last piece of cake she left out…”



“What can I say? I'm always winning.” Linea shrugged off her coat,



running her fingers through her honey-blonde hair, wet from the rain. Water droplets fell on my face.



I put out a hand. “Watch it.” She laughed.



I unwrapped my scarf and my own damp hair touched my bare neck. “Argh.” I shivered and shook out my hair.



Linea yelled and scooched far away from me, giving me a disapproving look.



Laughing, I picked up my drink and swallowed a mouthful.



My gaze skated around the room. Busters was a beehive this Friday night. It seemed everyone had clocked out after the work week ended and decided this was their favorite way to wind down.



It definitely was mine. Every few weekends, Linea and I showed up, had a few beers, and relaxed. Not that the karaoke singer's rendition of “Poker Face” was providing any form of relaxation.



“What is that?” Linea frowned and faced the stage.



The guy was in his element. He strutted across the stage, tossing his non- existent long hair over his shoulder.



“The diva we didn't know we needed.”



My friend laughed and shook her head. ""I want to go up there and tell him to stop. I've had a long week. He's ruining my evening.”



“Don't.” I eyed her. “I won't.”



Keeping my eyes on her, I sipped my beer.



Linea chuckled. “So, about next week's schedule…” “What? No. It’s the weekend, Linea, no shoptalk.”



Linea and I ran our own business, cleaning homes for a living. We loved helping others by creating spick-and-span, organized havens for them. It was fulfilling and fun working with my best friend. But it also bled into after- work hours.



“Fine.” She raised both hands and shrugged.



Linea grabbed her phone, and blue light illuminated her face. I slid lower in the booth, blew out a breath, and shot a gaze around. I could name almost every face my eyes connected with, and a couple waved. I waved back.



Lively chatter rang out around me. I could easily start up a conversation with anyone while my best friend was snapping different angles of her face to post selfies on Instagram. But chatting with the same people was all I ever



did.



Every day, the same routine. Clean houses. See the same faces. Visit our hometown bar.



I loved living in a small town; I really did. But lately I’d been…bored. I just wanted something different. Anything at all to spice up my life. But in Hannibal, that was too much to hope for.



Or was it?



My eyes fell on the entrance just as a man walked in. Unlike those making up the typical crowd at Busters, he was dressed to the nines. A black suit clung to his tall frame, and a dark blue tie ran down the front of the white button-down underneath.



I tilted my head, trying to make out his features. His face was turned down, concentration fixed on his black umbrella. With long deft fingers, he fastened the tie wrap. Lucky umbrella.



Then his gaze lifted. My heart clenched.



Deep gray eyes set in a rugged, strong face took in the room. Those stormy eyes bounced off me, and my breath caught. A sensation snaked through my belly—something foreign and delicious.



His gaze fixed on the bar, and his body followed. Lean strength sparked through with every measured step he took.



He dropped lithely onto a bar stool, his back to the booths. I shook myself out of my trance, glancing around. I’d lost myself there for a minute.



Judging by the ladies turned in his direction, I wasn't alone. All but Linea.



She was still focused on her phone. I elbowed her and nodded to the man.



She leaned over, trying to make out his face. “Oh my.” She sat back. “Who’s that silver fox?”



""Hell if I know."" My words came out a little breathless.



Linea gave no indication she noticed, her eyes still on the man. “But really. Who is he? Where did he come from? That face is hard to forget.”



More than his face. The energy surrounding him was potent, crackling like electricity. My body thrummed, wanting to tap into that power.



“Someone new? A visitor?”



“Probably,” I muttered, then sipped my beer. My insides were still recovering.



Someone new. It clicked. Different from all the people I knew—and loved



—but hell, I knew them all too well.



I didn't need to think about it. I should, instead, follow my instincts. How many times did breathtaking strangers show up in Hannibal?



This was the universe deciding I deserved a good time. Just one night to forget my humdrum life. I’d never before had a one-night stand. It was something every confident woman should experience once in her life, right? My girly bits agreed, aching to be touched by those skillful-looking hands that were now nursing a beer.



I swallowed. He was what I needed.



He’d be a break from the same old same old. A breath of fresh air.



I wanted—no, needed—that fresh air. One night of hot, meaningless sex.



The memories would last me a lifetime.



A shiver tingled up my spine, my nerves jumping. I was doing this. No turning back now.



I was going to hit on a handsome stranger.



Whatever resulted, stranger was the key word. A no strings attached, fun night. And if the sex was terrible, I'd never see him again, so it didn't matter.



“How many seconds until someone walks up to him?” Linea’s gaze flitted around the bar.



I fluffed out my hair. “Five seconds.”



“What?” My friend turned. “I was thinking they'd let him have at least one drink… Oh.” Linea's eyes skimmed my body. “Undo one button. No, two.”



I did as she asked. “Okay?”



“Mm-hmm.” She drained her bottle.



“Wish me a win.” I tossed her my scarf. It’d get in the way of my sexy look.



“May my winnings be with you.” Linea raised her empty bottle. “Gosh, I need another.”



Smiling at my friend, I slid the strap of my bag over my shoulder and started out of the booth. She followed suit. But as I headed for the bar, she dove into the next booth. A chorus of “hey” rang out behind me as our friends greeted Linea.



I paid them no mind, all my attention glued to the stranger's strong back. While others hunched over their drinks, he sat up straight, with perfect posture.



An image flashed through my head of my nails raking down his back. I bet his backside was muscular and taut. Fit for grabbing onto while he



pumped between my thighs.



Said legs turned to jelly the closer I got. I took a deep breath, shaking out my hair and relaxing my shoulders. So what if I scrubbed floors for a living? And in contrast, this hot, hunky stranger looked like he could grace the cover of GQ?



None of it mattered. We wouldn't exchange anything beyond the physical. We could be a one-night distraction for each other, satisfying our animalistic needs.



I reached the stool next to him in two strides and slid onto it. The only indication he noticed my existence was the slight tick of his jaw. It relaxed as he resumed staring at his drink.



That gave me an opportunity to really look. His sharp features—high cheekbones and a strong jawline—were softened by full lips and long lashes. His salt and pepper hair was pushed back from his forehead, faded at the edges, and fuller on top. I slid a discreet gaze to his finger. No ring or ring outline.



My eyes lingered on his long fingers, and I swallowed. I wanted those hands on me.



“Hey.” My voice came out smoky and low, despite my nerves. Win! The man side-eyed me.



Oh, shit. My stomach pooled with liquid heat from only a look.



Just that glance made me want to either shrink away or rub up against him. “You’re not from around here,” I continued, inwardly cringing at my cheesy pickup line.



His face turned to me now, brow raised. “What?”



Goosebumps skittered up my arms at his smooth, deep baritone. I wasn't sure where I found the voice to continue speaking. ""I know nearly every face in Hannibal. You're not from around here.”



“So?” His full brow arched higher, gray eyes rivaling the stormy skies outside.



I resisted the urge to stammer and forged on. He could just be at the end of a bad day. A little friendliness would help him loosen up. “You’re new, all alone. I could keep you company.”



His eyes ran down my body, pausing on my exposed cleavage. His throat worked for a second before his gaze lifted to my face. “No, thanks.”



His cold words doused the heat running through my veins. And yet…for a second, he looked ready to take me up on my offer.



Tossing my hair, I smiled. “Aww, come on. Everyone says I'm good company.”



“So go and keep everyone else company.”



“They're not hanging out at a bar all alone on a Friday night.”



He sighed, looking away from me. Instead of showing interest, it seemed I annoyed him. Was I so dull? A sinking feeling crowded in my belly. I looked behind me and spotted Linea. She waved, then gave me an enthusiastic thumbs-up.



I turned back to the man with a slightly boosted confidence. “So, would you like to buy me a drink?” I leaned forward on my elbow. His eyes ate me up once more, and I smiled. “That’s the decent thing to do.”



He tore his gaze from me, eyes back to his drink. “Maybe you should leave; that'd be the decent thing to do.""



I sat back, my face flaming. I opened my mouth and shut it. No witty comeback came to mind.



There was no fun spin I could put on his words. He had rejected me.



Clearly.



I hopped off the stool, hands wrapped around my bag strap. I looked toward Linea, but she was caught up in cheering on the next karaoke singer, who was doing a great job. Keeping my head down, I headed for the exit.



Rain plastered my hair to my face and my clothes to my skin. But I kept my face down and walked, determined to get home and forget my embarrassing encounter tonight.



Why had I thought I could be a sexy temptress and lure a sophisticated man like him in? I was just boring old Ava. And getting soaked in the pouring rain was what I got for stepping out of my comfort zone.



Suddenly, the rain stopped. I brought my head up. No, it hadn't stopped. It was still falling around me, but not on me because…someone was holding an umbrella.



I turned, and my gaze met gray eyes. I took a step back, moving back under the rainfall. ""What do you want?"" I eyed the man.



He looked at the empty road before meeting my eyes. ""I was being a jerk earlier."" He lowered his head, like the thought embarrassed him. Then his gaze met mine again. ""Share my umbrella and let me walk you home.""



I started to say no, but he cut in. “It's the decent thing to do.”



A small thrill zinged through me that he used my quip from earlier.



“Fine.”



Something that was not quite a smile passed across his face.



We huddled underneath the umbrella as we started off. Not the way I’d hoped the night would go. But the warmth from his body was welcome.

# Chapter 2



Liam



She remained silent on the walk home. Unsurprisingly so, since I shut down her earlier attempts. I was an asshole going off on her that way.



But it was intentional and for good reason.



Years of working with no downtime left no opportunities for socializing. Any break in my routine to take time off resulted in—you guessed it—more work.



Coming to Hannibal gave me a glimpse of life outside my normally busy schedule. I thought I'd hit a bar on my Friday night off. Only to have a stunning chestnut-haired goddess show up.



If I engaged in conversation with her, it wouldn't take five sentences for her to realize I sucked at flirting. Better to chase her away with my rude attitude than bear the embarrassment afterward. I thought I’d annoy her so she would move on.



What I didn't anticipate was how the hurt in her eyes would affect me. Then, her storming out into the rain caused me to worry for her well-being. I barely knew this gorgeous woman, and I already wanted to keep her safe.



She shivered now and wrapped her arms around her middle. Her shoulders folded in as if to protect her body from the chill. If only I could protect her more.



The umbrella managed to keep the worst of it away. But the rain blew in every direction, still hitting her, molding her clothes to her body.



I was drenched, too, but thought nothing of it. My body was too attuned to her pressing close to get some relief from the rain. And my eyes kept slipping to the curve of her ass in those tight black jeans.



She took a left turn onto the next street. “We’re close.”



My head whipped up. It was a busy street. Stores lined the road on both sides, some closed, others still open. But outside, only a few people huddled underneath umbrellas like us.



A short walk brought us to an adjoined coffee shop and bakery. “Home sweet home.” Her voice was light and airy.



I frowned. “You live in the shop?”



She laughed. “No, above it.” Her gaze rose and I followed it.



A small balcony hung over the store signs. Potted plants and flowers decorated it. A glass double door led out onto the balcony. Beyond that, it was dark inside.



“Come on up.” She nodded toward the spiral staircase. “We're soaked. I'll get you a towel, and maybe some tea to warm you up.”



Before I could answer, her feet hit the first rung. Closing the umbrella, I followed.



I tried to avert my eyes, but her ass looked good enough to bite. Or grab with my hands as she rode my cock.



“We’re here.” She stopped by her front door and fished out keys from her purse.



Her hands shook a little as she slid the key in. Was it from the cold or my presence? If it was the latter, her chirpy “Come on in” gave no indication.



I left the dripping umbrella by the door and walked in.



“I'll get the towels,” she announced, disappearing behind a door at the far end of the living room.



I looked around the room while I waited for my temptress to return. One long couch and a one-seater was all it could carry. They faced a flat screen TV hung up on the wall and a low coffee table tied it all together. Plants were scattered around in what little space remained.



I worked off my jacket and hung it on the coat rack. My eyes just took in the kitchenette in one sweep when she returned.



“Here are the—” she paused, eyes roaming over my upper body. Her gaze darkened and her tongue ran across her lower lip “—towels.”



She stood glued in one spot, staring. A small smile played on my lips. Closing the gap between us, I took one. “Thanks.”



She blinked. “Of course.” Turning away, she wrapped the towel around her hair.



I ran the towel through my own hair. I wouldn't truly be dry unless I got out of my clothes. Best to stop the wet tendrils from dripping down my face.



My hair was as dry as I could get it when I lowered my hands. My eyes caught on her. She was still drying her hair, hands lifted, making her wet top strain over her chest.



Those luscious tits tempted a groan from my throat. Just a taste. Her nipples stood hard and erect, begging to be licked.



The desire to suck one into my mouth was like a vise clutching my throat. I wanted to nibble on it, roll my tongue around the bud until she was panting.



She dropped her hands and shook out her hair, her chest shaking along with it.



Fuck me.



A strangled moan escaped my mouth.



Her eyes connected with mine then, lips parting. The towel slipped from her fingers, hitting the floor. Her chest rose and fell rapidly, throat dipping as she swallowed.



“So, um, about that tea…” She licked her lips. “What kind do you like?”



Tea? What was she talking about? The only thing I wanted on my tongue was the heat between her thighs.



“You know this isn't about tea.” My voice came out gruff.



Her face flushed as she whispered, “And you didn't want to just walk me home.”



I shook my head.



That small admission broke the invisible wall between us. She reached out, wrapping her arms around my neck. My hands went to her hips and I pulled her close, so her core was pressed against mine.



A small gasp left her lips just as our mouths crashed together. The taste of her fruity lip gloss burst on my tongue as I sucked on her lower lip. She moaned, yanking me down for a deeper kiss. And I was more than happy to oblige.

Just wanted to share a bit of frustration and also ask if anyone’s had a similar experience.

I recently ordered coffee from Tulum Coffee and let me be clear, I don’t think they have done anything wrong. I’ve heard good things about them, and I was genuinely excited to try their beans.

The problem is with the shipping company Shiprocket. It’s been almost 10 days since I placed my order, and the package still hasn’t arrived. I’m really worried that by the time it gets here, the coffee might be stale. I paid nearly ₹1000, and it feels like such a waste if I can’t even enjoy it fresh.

Has anyone else here in here faced similar delays with Shiprocket or with Tulum Coffee deliveries? 

Really hoping this doesn’t ruin the experience I was looking forward to this cup so much.

*“We’re drowning in technological breakthroughs while gasping for affordable healthcare.”*

We live in remarkable times. Times where your refrigerator can text you when you’re low on almond milk, but your health insurance has a deductible higher than the GDP of a small nation. Times where your watch can tell you exactly how poorly you slept last night, but you can’t afford the rent to sleep anywhere decent. Welcome to 21st century America: Home of the brave, land of the free… to innovate yourself into oblivion while your quality of life circles the drain.

Let’s be honest with ourselves for a minute. We’ve become a nation obsessed with innovation while the fundamentals of a decent existence keep slipping away. It’s like we’re perpetually chasing the digital equivalent of a sugar high while our societal body is developing type 2 diabetes. We’re the junkie who keeps scoring the next hit while our teeth fall out and our apartment gets repossessed.

# THE PURSUIT OF NEEDLESS PERFECTION

Take coffee. Simple, beautiful coffee. A beverage that humans have enjoyed for centuries. But no, that’s not good enough for us anymore. We need “Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold” – beans that have been digested by endangered weasels, pooped out onto virgin rainforest soil, harvested by monks who have taken vows of silence, transported down treacherous mountain paths by free-range donkeys who’ve been read bedtime stories, then shipped across the ocean on a sailing vessel made from reclaimed driftwood and powered only by the flatulence of the crew who eat nothing but organic lentils.

All so some tech bro in a Patagonia vest can spend twenty five dollars on a single cup, take a sip, and pronounce to his equally insufferable friends: “You taste that? That’s the notes of elderberry and the faint whisper of existential despair from the weasel’s digestive tract.”

Meanwhile, the barista serving this liquid miracle can’t afford healthcare and lives in a converted utility closet with three roommates.

But this isn’t just about coffee. It’s about our entire approach to societal progress. We’ve decided that innovation means making already decent things marginally better for people who already have more than enough, while the baseline of human dignity keeps eroding for everyone else.

# THE GREAT AMERICAN INNOVATION PARADOX

America has always had this strange split personality. We can put rovers on Mars and develop vaccines in record time, but ask us to ensure everyone has a roof over their head or access to a doctor, and suddenly we become helpless, hand-wringing philosophers pondering whether helping humans achieve basic stability might damage the purity of our economic theories.

Our innovation ecosystem works like this: Step one, identify something that already works fine. Step two, “disrupt” it by adding Bluetooth and an app. Step three, charge a 300% premium. Step four, watch your company get valued at billions while your workers need food stamps to survive.

Take Uber. Revolutionary, right? Now instead of having a stable job as a taxi driver, you can have the privilege of destroying your personal vehicle while an algorithm decides how much you’re worth minute by minute. But hey, you can track your ride on a map! Innovation!

Or look at healthcare. Other developed nations figured out decades ago how to provide universal coverage. But America? We’re too busy inventing apps that let you diagnose your rash through machine learning before telling you that you can’t afford the treatment.

“America doesn’t have healthcare,” George Carlin might say if he were alive today. “We have health insurance, which is just a complicated way of saying ‘die if you’re poor.’ But don’t worry, there’s an app to help you crowd-fund your insulin!”

# THE INNOVATION INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

There’s an entire ecosystem built around worshipping at the altar of “disruption.” TED talks where people in expensive jeans and no socks tell us how block-chain vertical farming will save humanity. Conferences where the word “revolutionary” gets thrown around more often than “hello.” Business magazines with covers featuring people who look like they were designed by AI to appear trustworthy yet visionary.

And let’s talk about Silicon Valley – that quasi-religious cult where twenty something billionaires are treated like prophets because they figured out a new way to sell ads or exploit the gig economy. These tech messiahs stand on stages in their meticulously casual attire explaining how their new platform will change the world – and by “change the world,” they mean “extract value from existing systems while contributing as little as possible back to society.”

“The Valley types,” as a modern comic might put it, “they don’t create products anymore. They create ‘experiences.’ You know what I call an experience? Going to the emergency room and finding out your insurance doesn’t cover it. Now THAT’S an experience.”

These innovation high priests have convinced us that every problem needs a technological solution. Housing crisis? Let’s make tiny homes controlled by AI! Food insecurity? Lab-grown meat printed by 3D printers! Climate change? Electric luxury cars for the rich! Income inequality? Here’s an app where you can invest your non-existent savings!

No one ever suggests maybe we could just… fix the systems we already have that worked fine before we “disrupted” them.

# THE STATUS ANXIETY TREADMILL

What’s driving this innovation obsession? Simple: status anxiety combined with good old-fashioned greed.

We’ve created a culture where your worth as a human is tied to having the newest thing before anyone else. It’s not even about having nice things – it’s about having new things, different things, exclusive things. Things that signal you’re not just consuming products; you’re consuming EXPERIENCES.

That’s why that tech bro needs his Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold coffee. It’s not because it tastes better than the perfectly good coffee at the local diner. It’s because it comes with a story. A story he can tell that positions himself as someone with access to rare experiences. Someone with refined taste. Someone better than you.

“You like coffee? Oh, I’m into single-origin Peruvian nano-lots where each bean is individually named and has its own Instagram account.”

This is consumption as identity. This is buying things not for what they do, but for what they say about you. And our innovation economy is more than happy to oblige, creating ever more specialized, ever more exclusive products and services for people desperate to distinguish themselves from the herd.

Meanwhile, the actual herd is just trying to afford ground beef.

# THE QUALITY OF LIFE COLLAPSE

While we’ve been busy innovating, something terrible has happened: life has gotten objectively worse for huge swaths of America.

Housing costs have skyrocketed. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy. Infrastructure is crumbling. Public education is underfunded. Mental health issues are epidemic. Loneliness has become a public health crisis. Life expectancy has declined. Social mobility has stagnated.

But hey, at least our phones are thinner!

“We’ve got 4K streaming to watch shows about how we can’t afford to live anymore,” a modern satirist might observe. “We’ve got same-day day delivery bringing packages to homes people can’t afford to own. We’ve got dating apps connecting people who are all too burned out from working multiple jobs to actually go on dates.”

Even the basics have gotten worse under the guise of getting better. Remember shopping? You’d go to a store, talk to a human, exchange money for goods, and leave. Simple. Now we have the “improved” experience:

Create an account. Remember your password. Download the app. Allow notifications. Join the loyalty program. Scan the QR code. Choose delivery window. Track your package. Rate your experience. Receive endless emails. Repeat.

Everything has become more complicated, more gamified, more surveilled, and ultimately more exhausting. And for what? So companies can extract more data from us? So they can eliminate jobs? So they can claim to be “tech companies” instead of whatever they actually are?

# THE CORPORATE INNOVATION SCAM

Let’s be clear about something: most corporate “innovation” isn’t about making your life better. It’s about making shareholders richer.

When a company “disrupts” an industry, what they’re really disrupting is the social contract between businesses, workers, and customers. They’re finding ways to deliver the same basic service while paying workers less, charging customers more, collecting valuable data, and calling it “progress.”

Look at the banking industry. They’ve innovated themselves from having human tellers who knew your name to having apps that charge you fees for accessing your own money. They’ve innovated from giving reasonable loans to creating incomprehensible financial products that crashed the global economy.

“Banks used to rob you with a gun,” as Carlin might say. “Now they rob you with a terms of service agreement. Progress!”

Or look at the airline industry. They’ve “innovated” by removing legroom, charging for every minor service, and treating passengers like self-loading cargo. But don’t worry, now you can use an app to track exactly how late your flight will be!

This is regression masquerading as progression. It’s companies finding ever more sophisticated ways to give you less while convincing you that you’re getting more.

# THE INNOVATION INEQUALITY GAP

The most perverse aspect of our innovation obsession is how unevenly its benefits are distributed. The technological marvels we create flow upward, while the costs and disruptions flow downward.

The wealthy get personalized medicine, while the poor get WebMD. The privileged get same-day day delivery, while the underpaid get impossible delivery quotas. The comfortable get smart homes, while the struggling get smart landlords who use algorithms to maximize rent extraction.

Even when innovations could theoretically benefit everyone, we find ways to ensure they don’t. We had the technology to let everyone work remotely for decades – but it took a pandemic to force the issue. And the minute the emergency passed, the power brokers started demanding workers return to offices, because heaven forbid the plebeians gain any lasting control over their work lives.

“America has the best technology money can buy,” a satirist would note. “Unfortunately, most Americans don’t have the money to buy it.”

# THE INNOVATION DISTRACTION MACHINE

Perhaps the most insidious aspect of our innovation fixation is how it distracts us from addressing fundamental problems. It’s the equivalent of putting a high-tech bandage on a gunshot wound while refusing to discuss gun control.

Housing crisis? Let’s innovate with micro-apartments and co-living spaces instead of addressing why housing has become an investment vehicle rather than a basic human need.

Healthcare disaster? Let’s create wearable devices that monitor your vitals in real-timereal time but don’t actually treat anything when you can’t afford a doctor.

Climate catastrophe? Let’s develop carbon capture technology instead of simply regulating the industries causing the problem in the first place.

It’s techno-optimism as political anesthesia. As long as we believe some genius in a garage is about to solve all our problems with the next revolutionary app or device, we don’t have to grapple with the much harder work of fixing broken systems and power structures.

# THE AMAZON CRYOGENIC BLACK GOLD SYNDROME

Let’s circle back to our overpriced coffee example because it perfectly exemplifies our national psychosis around innovation and status.

The Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold coffee isn’t about taste – it’s about narrative. It’s about the stories we tell ourselves to justify obscene spending on marginally improved experiences while basic human needs go unmet.

The marketing doesn’t sell you coffee; it sells you ethics (sustainable!), adventure (exotic!), exclusivity (rare!), identity (discerning!), and most importantly, the feeling that you’re ahead of the curve.

That last part is crucial. The modern innovation consumer doesn’t want the best thing; they want the next thing. They want to be first. They want to be the person who “discovered” something before it was cool. And they’re willing to pay absurd premiums for that fleeting status boost.

“We’ve created a system,” a comedian might observe, “where people will pay more for the story about the coffee than for the coffee itself. The actual beverage could be fermented moose urine, but as long as there’s a compelling backstory about how the moose were massage-therapied daily and the urine was collected only during full moons, some asshole with ‘Founder’ in his bio will pay fifty bucks for it.”

# THE PERFORMATIVE INNOVATION LIFESTYLE

This innovation obsession has spawned an entire lifestyle – one built around the performative consumption of the newest, most exclusive products and experiences.

It’s not enough to drink good coffee; you have to drink the right coffee. It’s not enough to eat healthy food; you have to eat food with a philosophy and a creation myth. It’s not enough to exercise; you have to follow a fitness regimen named after ancient warriors or space-age science.

Every aspect of existence becomes an opportunity to demonstrate that you’re on the cutting edge, that you’ve done your research, that you care more deeply and understand more fully than the average consumer.

“These people don’t have hobbies anymore,” a satirist might say. “They have curated lifestyle modalities. They don’t have opinions; they have thought leadership. They don’t buy products; they align themselves with brand values.”

And all of this costs money. A lot of money. Money that could be spent on, I don’t know, saving for retirement or helping others or simply living without constant financial anxiety.

But no, that wouldn’t be innovative, would it?

# THE CULT OF DISRUPTION

We’ve been so thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult of disruption that we’ve forgotten a basic truth: not everything needs to be disrupted. Some things work just fine as they are.

Libraries. Public parks. Bicycles. Cast iron pans. A cup of coffee that costs two dollars and tastes just fine.

But these don’t make good TED talks, do they? “I’m here to tell you why the park bench is actually perfect as is and doesn’t need blockchain integration” doesn’t get venture funding.

“Disruption used to mean something broke,” a comedian might point out. “Now it means some Stanford dropout is going to make your life more complicated while making himself very rich. ‘I’m disrupting the water industry with H2O as a service!’ No, buddy, you’re selling water with a subscription model. Calm down.”

The language of innovation has become so bloated, so disconnected from actual value, that it’s essentially meaningless. Everything is revolutionary. Everything is game-changing. Everything is the next big thing.

Until it isn’t, and we all move on to the next innovation distraction.

# THE ANALOG REBELLION

Here’s where things get interesting. As our lives have become increasingly digitized, monetized, optimized, and generally made more complicated in the name of convenience, a countertrend has emerged.

People are rediscovering analog experiences. Vinyl records. Film photography. Handwritten letters. Books made of actual paper. Cooking from scratch. Growing vegetables. Making things with their hands.

“It’s come full circle,” a modern Carlin might observe. “We spent billions developing digital technology to replace everything, and now people are paying premium prices for the experiences we were trying to eliminate. Next they’ll be selling us authentic, artisanal dial-up modem sounds to help us sleep.”

There’s something revealing about this retreat to the tactile, the physical, the directly experienced. It suggests that for all our innovation, we’ve failed to address some fundamental human needs. The need for connection. For sensory experience. For doing things that don’t involve staring at screens.

But even this rebellion has been commodified. “Analog experiences” are now premium products for the privileged. The same tech bros sipping Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold are the ones buying thousand-dollar dollar turntables and “artisanal” everything.

# THE QUALITY OF LIFE EQUATION

Here’s a radical thought: what if we redirected even a fraction of the energy, creativity, and resources we pour into marginal innovations toward improving basic quality of life?

What if, instead of developing the next food delivery app, we ensured everyone had access to nutritious food?

What if, instead of creating VR office environments, we made actual offices humane places to work, with reasonable hours and fair pay?

What if, instead of inventing new financial instruments, we made the existing financial system work for ordinary people?

“America is like that friend who buys a $2,000 espresso machine while their roof is leaking,” a comedian might say. “Yeah, the coffee’s great, but maybe fix the roof first?”

The tragedy is that we know how to solve most of our quality of life problems. The solutions aren’t mysterious, and they don’t require technological breakthroughs. They require political will and a reallocation of resources.

Universal healthcare? Dozens of countries have figured it out. Affordable housing? It’s been done before. Livable wages? Not rocket science. Work-life balance? See: most of Europe.

But these solutions aren’t sexy. They don’t make good headlines or attract venture capital. They’re just the boring work of building a functioning society.

# THE ATTENTION ECONOMY TRAP

Part of our problem is that our economy has transformed from one that produces things to one that captures and monetizes attention.

In this new economy, constant novelty is essential. Innovation isn’t about solving problems; it’s about generating content, creating buzz, driving engagement. It’s innovation as entertainment rather than improvement.

“We don’t have citizens anymore,” a satirist would note. “We have users. We don’t have public discourse; we have engagement metrics. We don’t solve problems; we optimize for clicks.”

This attention economy rewards the novel over the necessary, the provocative over the practical, the disruptive over the dependable. It’s an economy built for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs pitching miracle apps, not for plumbers fixing broken pipes or teachers educating children.

And yet, which actually improves quality of life more? Another social media platform, or functioning plumbing? Another food delivery service, or well-educated kids?

# THE INNOVATION WITHOUT PURPOSE

Too much of our innovation happens without anyone asking a simple question: why? Why are we creating this? What problem does it actually solve? Does the world need this, or are we just creating new desires to sell new products?

“We’ve got engineers staying up all night to optimize ad delivery algorithms,” a comedian might observe, “while the subway breaks down and bridges collapse. We’ve got geniuses designing digital pets while real people can’t afford their medications.”

We’re trapped in a system that rewards certain types of innovation – the kind that generate profit and capture attention – while ignoring others that might actually improve lives but don’t have obvious revenue models.

Public goods don’t attract venture capital. Clean water systems don’t have flashy IPOs. Affordable housing doesn’t scale like a tech platform.

So we end up with a thousand meditation apps but crumbling mental health services. A hundred food delivery services but food deserts in poor neighborhoods. Endless entertainment options but declining life expectancy.

# THE GREAT INNOVATION CONTRADICTION

Here’s the central contradiction of our time: we’ve never had more technological capability to solve problems, and yet many of our most basic problems remain unsolved or are getting worse.

We can edit genes and explore Mars, but we can’t figure out how to make housing affordable. We can create virtual worlds, but we can’t clean up the actual world we live in. We can develop AI that beats humans at every game, but we can’t beat poverty or provide universal healthcare.

“If aliens came down tomorrow,” a satirist might say, “they’d be mighty confused. ‘So you can send instant messages across the planet, but people are still sleeping on the streets? You can create lifelike digital worlds but your real world is burning? What exactly are your priorities?’”

The answer, of course, is that our innovation is driven by market incentives, not human needs. And the market rewards what’s profitable, not necessarily what’s important.

# THE INNOVATION REBOOT

So where do we go from here? How do we escape this cycle of pointless innovation and declining quality of life?

First, we might start by reclaiming the very concept of innovation. True innovation isn’t just about new products or services; it’s about finding better ways to meet human needs. Sometimes that means technological breakthroughs, but often it means social breakthroughs – new ways of organizing ourselves, new systems, new priorities.

Second, we could start measuring success differently. Instead of GDP growth or stock market gains or unicorn startups, what if we measured quality of life? What if our national scoreboard tracked things like leisure time, access to healthcare, housing security, and happiness?

“Imagine,” a modern philosopher-comedian might suggest, “if we judged our country not by how many billionaires it produced but by how many people could get sick without going bankrupt. Crazy thought, I know.”

Third, we might redirect our innovative capacity toward the fundamentals. We’ve got plenty of brilliant minds – what if we pointed them at the basics of human thriving rather than the next app or gadget? What might we achieve if Silicon Valley suddenly decided that homelessness was more interesting than virtual reality?

# THE WISDOM OF ENOUGH

Perhaps what we need most is a cultural shift – from valuing the new and the next to valuing the sufficient and the sustainable. From chasing more to embracing enough.

Enough house to live comfortably. Enough food to be healthy. Enough money to be secure. Enough time to enjoy life. Enough purpose to feel fulfilled. Enough community to feel connected.

“The most radical act in consumer culture,” a wise observer might note, “is being satisfied. Nothing terrifies corporations more than someone saying ‘I have enough.’”

This doesn’t mean rejecting progress or innovation. It means being thoughtful about what constitutes actual progress versus what’s just new for the sake of newness.

# THE CHOICE BEFORE US

We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to more of the same – an innovation treadmill that benefits the few while basic quality of life erodes for the many. The other path redirects our incredible human creativity and technological prowess toward building a society where everyone can thrive.

Will we continue chasing Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold while our foundations crumble? Or will we remember that innovation without purpose is just distraction, and that the greatest innovation would be to create a society where everyone has enough?

“The true measure of a civilization,” our satirist philosopher might conclude, “isn’t how many apps it produces or how fancy its coffee gets. It’s how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, all our innovation hasn’t made us very civilized at all.”

Maybe it’s time to innovate our priorities.

# EPILOGUE: THE WEASEL’S REVENGE

Somewhere in the Amazon rainforest, a weasel is digesting coffee beans, blissfully unaware that its excrement will soon be worth more per ounce than gold. It doesn’t know about Silicon Valley or status anxiety or the innovation economy.

It just knows that those beans give it terrible gas.

Perhaps there’s wisdom in that weasel – wisdom about the absurdity of human striving, about our endless quest for the next new thing while neglecting what truly matters.

“Be like the weasel,” our comic sage might advise. “Eat what you need, poop when you must, and don’t worry about whether your droppings are artisanal enough for some tech bro’s Instagram.”

In the end, the weasel might be living a better quality of life than many Americans. And that, more than anything else, shows just how badly our innovation obsession has failed us.

AI tools can’t maintain brand consistency on their own.

Every interaction with tools like ChatGPT or Midjourney starts from scratch. It’s like hiring a brand-new marketing team every single day—one that knows *nothing* about your voice, audience, or guidelines. We’ve run into this exact issue *a lot* ourselves.

Here’s what we’ve seen again and again:

* Teams waste hours feeding brand docs into AI tools
* Outputs vary wildly, even with the same prompts
* Brand consistency is quickly becoming a massive bottleneck

The pattern is clear: As AI adoption ramps up, **brand memory is the thing most companies are missing**.

Everyone’s still hyped that AI can generate content at all. But the real challenge isn’t creation—it’s **consistency**.

Life after AI isn’t about replacing people. It’s about *extending* your brand memory across every touchpoint so the tech actually works *with* you, not against you.

1l72a6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TBLIGroup/comments/1l72a6n/the_innovation_delusion/,THE INNOVATION DELUSION,"# America’s Love Affair with Shiny Objects and the Decline of Everything Else

*“We’re drowning in technological breakthroughs while gasping for affordable healthcare.”*

We live in remarkable times. Times where your refrigerator can text you when you’re low on almond milk, but your health insurance has a deductible higher than the GDP of a small nation. Times where your watch can tell you exactly how poorly you slept last night, but you can’t afford the rent to sleep anywhere decent. Welcome to 21st century America: Home of the brave, land of the free… to innovate yourself into oblivion while your quality of life circles the drain.

Let’s be honest with ourselves for a minute. We’ve become a nation obsessed with innovation while the fundamentals of a decent existence keep slipping away. It’s like we’re perpetually chasing the digital equivalent of a sugar high while our societal body is developing type 2 diabetes. We’re the junkie who keeps scoring the next hit while our teeth fall out and our apartment gets repossessed.

# THE PURSUIT OF NEEDLESS PERFECTION

Take coffee. Simple, beautiful coffee. A beverage that humans have enjoyed for centuries. But no, that’s not good enough for us anymore. We need “Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold” – beans that have been digested by endangered weasels, pooped out onto virgin rainforest soil, harvested by monks who have taken vows of silence, transported down treacherous mountain paths by free-range donkeys who’ve been read bedtime stories, then shipped across the ocean on a sailing vessel made from reclaimed driftwood and powered only by the flatulence of the crew who eat nothing but organic lentils.

All so some tech bro in a Patagonia vest can spend twenty five dollars on a single cup, take a sip, and pronounce to his equally insufferable friends: “You taste that? That’s the notes of elderberry and the faint whisper of existential despair from the weasel’s digestive tract.”

Meanwhile, the barista serving this liquid miracle can’t afford healthcare and lives in a converted utility closet with three roommates.

But this isn’t just about coffee. It’s about our entire approach to societal progress. We’ve decided that innovation means making already decent things marginally better for people who already have more than enough, while the baseline of human dignity keeps eroding for everyone else.

# THE GREAT AMERICAN INNOVATION PARADOX

America has always had this strange split personality. We can put rovers on Mars and develop vaccines in record time, but ask us to ensure everyone has a roof over their head or access to a doctor, and suddenly we become helpless, hand-wringing philosophers pondering whether helping humans achieve basic stability might damage the purity of our economic theories.

Our innovation ecosystem works like this: Step one, identify something that already works fine. Step two, “disrupt” it by adding Bluetooth and an app. Step three, charge a 300% premium. Step four, watch your company get valued at billions while your workers need food stamps to survive.

Take Uber. Revolutionary, right? Now instead of having a stable job as a taxi driver, you can have the privilege of destroying your personal vehicle while an algorithm decides how much you’re worth minute by minute. But hey, you can track your ride on a map! Innovation!

Or look at healthcare. Other developed nations figured out decades ago how to provide universal coverage. But America? We’re too busy inventing apps that let you diagnose your rash through machine learning before telling you that you can’t afford the treatment.

“America doesn’t have healthcare,” George Carlin might say if he were alive today. “We have health insurance, which is just a complicated way of saying ‘die if you’re poor.’ But don’t worry, there’s an app to help you crowd-fund your insulin!”

# THE INNOVATION INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

There’s an entire ecosystem built around worshipping at the altar of “disruption.” TED talks where people in expensive jeans and no socks tell us how block-chain vertical farming will save humanity. Conferences where the word “revolutionary” gets thrown around more often than “hello.” Business magazines with covers featuring people who look like they were designed by AI to appear trustworthy yet visionary.

And let’s talk about Silicon Valley – that quasi-religious cult where twenty something billionaires are treated like prophets because they figured out a new way to sell ads or exploit the gig economy. These tech messiahs stand on stages in their meticulously casual attire explaining how their new platform will change the world – and by “change the world,” they mean “extract value from existing systems while contributing as little as possible back to society.”

“The Valley types,” as a modern comic might put it, “they don’t create products anymore. They create ‘experiences.’ You know what I call an experience? Going to the emergency room and finding out your insurance doesn’t cover it. Now THAT’S an experience.”

These innovation high priests have convinced us that every problem needs a technological solution. Housing crisis? Let’s make tiny homes controlled by AI! Food insecurity? Lab-grown meat printed by 3D printers! Climate change? Electric luxury cars for the rich! Income inequality? Here’s an app where you can invest your non-existent savings!

No one ever suggests maybe we could just… fix the systems we already have that worked fine before we “disrupted” them.

# THE STATUS ANXIETY TREADMILL

What’s driving this innovation obsession? Simple: status anxiety combined with good old-fashioned greed.

We’ve created a culture where your worth as a human is tied to having the newest thing before anyone else. It’s not even about having nice things – it’s about having new things, different things, exclusive things. Things that signal you’re not just consuming products; you’re consuming EXPERIENCES.

That’s why that tech bro needs his Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold coffee. It’s not because it tastes better than the perfectly good coffee at the local diner. It’s because it comes with a story. A story he can tell that positions himself as someone with access to rare experiences. Someone with refined taste. Someone better than you.

“You like coffee? Oh, I’m into single-origin Peruvian nano-lots where each bean is individually named and has its own Instagram account.”

This is consumption as identity. This is buying things not for what they do, but for what they say about you. And our innovation economy is more than happy to oblige, creating ever more specialized, ever more exclusive products and services for people desperate to distinguish themselves from the herd.

Meanwhile, the actual herd is just trying to afford ground beef.

# THE QUALITY OF LIFE COLLAPSE

While we’ve been busy innovating, something terrible has happened: life has gotten objectively worse for huge swaths of America.

Housing costs have skyrocketed. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy. Infrastructure is crumbling. Public education is underfunded. Mental health issues are epidemic. Loneliness has become a public health crisis. Life expectancy has declined. Social mobility has stagnated.

But hey, at least our phones are thinner!

“We’ve got 4K streaming to watch shows about how we can’t afford to live anymore,” a modern satirist might observe. “We’ve got same-day day delivery bringing packages to homes people can’t afford to own. We’ve got dating apps connecting people who are all too burned out from working multiple jobs to actually go on dates.”

Even the basics have gotten worse under the guise of getting better. Remember shopping? You’d go to a store, talk to a human, exchange money for goods, and leave. Simple. Now we have the “improved” experience:

Create an account. Remember your password. Download the app. Allow notifications. Join the loyalty program. Scan the QR code. Choose delivery window. Track your package. Rate your experience. Receive endless emails. Repeat.

Everything has become more complicated, more gamified, more surveilled, and ultimately more exhausting. And for what? So companies can extract more data from us? So they can eliminate jobs? So they can claim to be “tech companies” instead of whatever they actually are?

# THE CORPORATE INNOVATION SCAM

Let’s be clear about something: most corporate “innovation” isn’t about making your life better. It’s about making shareholders richer.

When a company “disrupts” an industry, what they’re really disrupting is the social contract between businesses, workers, and customers. They’re finding ways to deliver the same basic service while paying workers less, charging customers more, collecting valuable data, and calling it “progress.”

Look at the banking industry. They’ve innovated themselves from having human tellers who knew your name to having apps that charge you fees for accessing your own money. They’ve innovated from giving reasonable loans to creating incomprehensible financial products that crashed the global economy.

“Banks used to rob you with a gun,” as Carlin might say. “Now they rob you with a terms of service agreement. Progress!”

Or look at the airline industry. They’ve “innovated” by removing legroom, charging for every minor service, and treating passengers like self-loading cargo. But don’t worry, now you can use an app to track exactly how late your flight will be!

This is regression masquerading as progression. It’s companies finding ever more sophisticated ways to give you less while convincing you that you’re getting more.

# THE INNOVATION INEQUALITY GAP

The most perverse aspect of our innovation obsession is how unevenly its benefits are distributed. The technological marvels we create flow upward, while the costs and disruptions flow downward.

The wealthy get personalized medicine, while the poor get WebMD. The privileged get same-day day delivery, while the underpaid get impossible delivery quotas. The comfortable get smart homes, while the struggling get smart landlords who use algorithms to maximize rent extraction.

Even when innovations could theoretically benefit everyone, we find ways to ensure they don’t. We had the technology to let everyone work remotely for decades – but it took a pandemic to force the issue. And the minute the emergency passed, the power brokers started demanding workers return to offices, because heaven forbid the plebeians gain any lasting control over their work lives.

“America has the best technology money can buy,” a satirist would note. “Unfortunately, most Americans don’t have the money to buy it.”

# THE INNOVATION DISTRACTION MACHINE

Perhaps the most insidious aspect of our innovation fixation is how it distracts us from addressing fundamental problems. It’s the equivalent of putting a high-tech bandage on a gunshot wound while refusing to discuss gun control.

Housing crisis? Let’s innovate with micro-apartments and co-living spaces instead of addressing why housing has become an investment vehicle rather than a basic human need.

Healthcare disaster? Let’s create wearable devices that monitor your vitals in real-timereal time but don’t actually treat anything when you can’t afford a doctor.

Climate catastrophe? Let’s develop carbon capture technology instead of simply regulating the industries causing the problem in the first place.

It’s techno-optimism as political anesthesia. As long as we believe some genius in a garage is about to solve all our problems with the next revolutionary app or device, we don’t have to grapple with the much harder work of fixing broken systems and power structures.

# THE AMAZON CRYOGENIC BLACK GOLD SYNDROME

Let’s circle back to our overpriced coffee example because it perfectly exemplifies our national psychosis around innovation and status.

The Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold coffee isn’t about taste – it’s about narrative. It’s about the stories we tell ourselves to justify obscene spending on marginally improved experiences while basic human needs go unmet.

The marketing doesn’t sell you coffee; it sells you ethics (sustainable!), adventure (exotic!), exclusivity (rare!), identity (discerning!), and most importantly, the feeling that you’re ahead of the curve.

That last part is crucial. The modern innovation consumer doesn’t want the best thing; they want the next thing. They want to be first. They want to be the person who “discovered” something before it was cool. And they’re willing to pay absurd premiums for that fleeting status boost.

“We’ve created a system,” a comedian might observe, “where people will pay more for the story about the coffee than for the coffee itself. The actual beverage could be fermented moose urine, but as long as there’s a compelling backstory about how the moose were massage-therapied daily and the urine was collected only during full moons, some asshole with ‘Founder’ in his bio will pay fifty bucks for it.”

# THE PERFORMATIVE INNOVATION LIFESTYLE

This innovation obsession has spawned an entire lifestyle – one built around the performative consumption of the newest, most exclusive products and experiences.

It’s not enough to drink good coffee; you have to drink the right coffee. It’s not enough to eat healthy food; you have to eat food with a philosophy and a creation myth. It’s not enough to exercise; you have to follow a fitness regimen named after ancient warriors or space-age science.

Every aspect of existence becomes an opportunity to demonstrate that you’re on the cutting edge, that you’ve done your research, that you care more deeply and understand more fully than the average consumer.

“These people don’t have hobbies anymore,” a satirist might say. “They have curated lifestyle modalities. They don’t have opinions; they have thought leadership. They don’t buy products; they align themselves with brand values.”

And all of this costs money. A lot of money. Money that could be spent on, I don’t know, saving for retirement or helping others or simply living without constant financial anxiety.

But no, that wouldn’t be innovative, would it?

# THE CULT OF DISRUPTION

We’ve been so thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult of disruption that we’ve forgotten a basic truth: not everything needs to be disrupted. Some things work just fine as they are.

Libraries. Public parks. Bicycles. Cast iron pans. A cup of coffee that costs two dollars and tastes just fine.

But these don’t make good TED talks, do they? “I’m here to tell you why the park bench is actually perfect as is and doesn’t need blockchain integration” doesn’t get venture funding.

“Disruption used to mean something broke,” a comedian might point out. “Now it means some Stanford dropout is going to make your life more complicated while making himself very rich. ‘I’m disrupting the water industry with H2O as a service!’ No, buddy, you’re selling water with a subscription model. Calm down.”

The language of innovation has become so bloated, so disconnected from actual value, that it’s essentially meaningless. Everything is revolutionary. Everything is game-changing. Everything is the next big thing.

Until it isn’t, and we all move on to the next innovation distraction.

# THE ANALOG REBELLION

Here’s where things get interesting. As our lives have become increasingly digitized, monetized, optimized, and generally made more complicated in the name of convenience, a countertrend has emerged.

People are rediscovering analog experiences. Vinyl records. Film photography. Handwritten letters. Books made of actual paper. Cooking from scratch. Growing vegetables. Making things with their hands.

“It’s come full circle,” a modern Carlin might observe. “We spent billions developing digital technology to replace everything, and now people are paying premium prices for the experiences we were trying to eliminate. Next they’ll be selling us authentic, artisanal dial-up modem sounds to help us sleep.”

There’s something revealing about this retreat to the tactile, the physical, the directly experienced. It suggests that for all our innovation, we’ve failed to address some fundamental human needs. The need for connection. For sensory experience. For doing things that don’t involve staring at screens.

But even this rebellion has been commodified. “Analog experiences” are now premium products for the privileged. The same tech bros sipping Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold are the ones buying thousand-dollar dollar turntables and “artisanal” everything.

# THE QUALITY OF LIFE EQUATION

Here’s a radical thought: what if we redirected even a fraction of the energy, creativity, and resources we pour into marginal innovations toward improving basic quality of life?

What if, instead of developing the next food delivery app, we ensured everyone had access to nutritious food?

What if, instead of creating VR office environments, we made actual offices humane places to work, with reasonable hours and fair pay?

What if, instead of inventing new financial instruments, we made the existing financial system work for ordinary people?

“America is like that friend who buys a $2,000 espresso machine while their roof is leaking,” a comedian might say. “Yeah, the coffee’s great, but maybe fix the roof first?”

The tragedy is that we know how to solve most of our quality of life problems. The solutions aren’t mysterious, and they don’t require technological breakthroughs. They require political will and a reallocation of resources.

Universal healthcare? Dozens of countries have figured it out. Affordable housing? It’s been done before. Livable wages? Not rocket science. Work-life balance? See: most of Europe.

But these solutions aren’t sexy. They don’t make good headlines or attract venture capital. They’re just the boring work of building a functioning society.

# THE ATTENTION ECONOMY TRAP

Part of our problem is that our economy has transformed from one that produces things to one that captures and monetizes attention.

In this new economy, constant novelty is essential. Innovation isn’t about solving problems; it’s about generating content, creating buzz, driving engagement. It’s innovation as entertainment rather than improvement.

“We don’t have citizens anymore,” a satirist would note. “We have users. We don’t have public discourse; we have engagement metrics. We don’t solve problems; we optimize for clicks.”

This attention economy rewards the novel over the necessary, the provocative over the practical, the disruptive over the dependable. It’s an economy built for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs pitching miracle apps, not for plumbers fixing broken pipes or teachers educating children.

And yet, which actually improves quality of life more? Another social media platform, or functioning plumbing? Another food delivery service, or well-educated kids?

# THE INNOVATION WITHOUT PURPOSE

Too much of our innovation happens without anyone asking a simple question: why? Why are we creating this? What problem does it actually solve? Does the world need this, or are we just creating new desires to sell new products?

“We’ve got engineers staying up all night to optimize ad delivery algorithms,” a comedian might observe, “while the subway breaks down and bridges collapse. We’ve got geniuses designing digital pets while real people can’t afford their medications.”

We’re trapped in a system that rewards certain types of innovation – the kind that generate profit and capture attention – while ignoring others that might actually improve lives but don’t have obvious revenue models.

Public goods don’t attract venture capital. Clean water systems don’t have flashy IPOs. Affordable housing doesn’t scale like a tech platform.

So we end up with a thousand meditation apps but crumbling mental health services. A hundred food delivery services but food deserts in poor neighborhoods. Endless entertainment options but declining life expectancy.

# THE GREAT INNOVATION CONTRADICTION

Here’s the central contradiction of our time: we’ve never had more technological capability to solve problems, and yet many of our most basic problems remain unsolved or are getting worse.

We can edit genes and explore Mars, but we can’t figure out how to make housing affordable. We can create virtual worlds, but we can’t clean up the actual world we live in. We can develop AI that beats humans at every game, but we can’t beat poverty or provide universal healthcare.

“If aliens came down tomorrow,” a satirist might say, “they’d be mighty confused. ‘So you can send instant messages across the planet, but people are still sleeping on the streets? You can create lifelike digital worlds but your real world is burning? What exactly are your priorities?’”

The answer, of course, is that our innovation is driven by market incentives, not human needs. And the market rewards what’s profitable, not necessarily what’s important.

# THE INNOVATION REBOOT

So where do we go from here? How do we escape this cycle of pointless innovation and declining quality of life?

First, we might start by reclaiming the very concept of innovation. True innovation isn’t just about new products or services; it’s about finding better ways to meet human needs. Sometimes that means technological breakthroughs, but often it means social breakthroughs – new ways of organizing ourselves, new systems, new priorities.

Second, we could start measuring success differently. Instead of GDP growth or stock market gains or unicorn startups, what if we measured quality of life? What if our national scoreboard tracked things like leisure time, access to healthcare, housing security, and happiness?

“Imagine,” a modern philosopher-comedian might suggest, “if we judged our country not by how many billionaires it produced but by how many people could get sick without going bankrupt. Crazy thought, I know.”

Third, we might redirect our innovative capacity toward the fundamentals. We’ve got plenty of brilliant minds – what if we pointed them at the basics of human thriving rather than the next app or gadget? What might we achieve if Silicon Valley suddenly decided that homelessness was more interesting than virtual reality?

# THE WISDOM OF ENOUGH

Perhaps what we need most is a cultural shift – from valuing the new and the next to valuing the sufficient and the sustainable. From chasing more to embracing enough.

Enough house to live comfortably. Enough food to be healthy. Enough money to be secure. Enough time to enjoy life. Enough purpose to feel fulfilled. Enough community to feel connected.

“The most radical act in consumer culture,” a wise observer might note, “is being satisfied. Nothing terrifies corporations more than someone saying ‘I have enough.’”

This doesn’t mean rejecting progress or innovation. It means being thoughtful about what constitutes actual progress versus what’s just new for the sake of newness.

# THE CHOICE BEFORE US

We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to more of the same – an innovation treadmill that benefits the few while basic quality of life erodes for the many. The other path redirects our incredible human creativity and technological prowess toward building a society where everyone can thrive.

Will we continue chasing Amazon Cryogenic Black Gold while our foundations crumble? Or will we remember that innovation without purpose is just distraction, and that the greatest innovation would be to create a society where everyone has enough?

“The true measure of a civilization,” our satirist philosopher might conclude, “isn’t how many apps it produces or how fancy its coffee gets. It’s how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, all our innovation hasn’t made us very civilized at all.”

Maybe it’s time to innovate our priorities.

# EPILOGUE: THE WEASEL’S REVENGE

Somewhere in the Amazon rainforest, a weasel is digesting coffee beans, blissfully unaware that its excrement will soon be worth more per ounce than gold. It doesn’t know about Silicon Valley or status anxiety or the innovation economy.

It just knows that those beans give it terrible gas.

Perhaps there’s wisdom in that weasel – wisdom about the absurdity of human striving, about our endless quest for the next new thing while neglecting what truly matters.

“Be like the weasel,” our comic sage might advise. “Eat what you need, poop when you must, and don’t worry about whether your droppings are artisanal enough for some tech bro’s Instagram.”

In the end, the weasel might be living a better quality of life than many Americans. And that, more than anything else, shows just how badly our innovation obsession has failed us.

1l728sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Random_person088/comments/1l728sh/whats_your_worst_hospital_experience/,What's your worst hospital experience?,"I used to love going to the local hospital, but this one experience changed that forever. The old doctor who always treated me, whether it was a check-up, vaccination, or something else, always did so with gentleness and a kind smile. He always gave me a candy or some cookies afterwards for 'being a good patient'.

He passed a few years back, and while I was sad, my new doctor was great as well. He just moved into the city, and coincidentally, was my neighbour. He would play with me when I was bored, and would 'teach' me about being a doctor.

But not long after, he got a job offer at a major hospital. He accepted and left as well. We never met again. I didn't need to go to the hospital as much anymore, as I used to have a disease that caused some walking problems. 

That was when I was around six. When I turned ten, I had ran a extremely high fever and was shivering all over. My mother rushed me to the hospital, but my father was at work with the car, so we could only walk there.

As we walked, I grew worse, and my mother had to carry me, slowing us down. By the time we got there, I was burning all over and barely staying conscious. Thankfully, the receptionist noticed my state and immediately called for the doctor.

She wasn't the problem though, it was the new doctor. Unlike my previous ones, he carried this arrogant and superior look, as if the whole world owed him something. He stuffed his dirty hands into his white pockets, barely glancing at the report board.

He looked us up and down, and his disdain was obvious in his eyes. With a sigh and extreme reluctance, he lazily reached out to the clipboard, flipping through the pages while casually sipping coffee.

My mother spoke up annoyed and worriedly, ""Excuse me, doctor! My daughter is burning up and you can't do anything?""

The doctor only told her arrogantly, ""All she has is a slight fever. Calm down miss, she isn't going to die or anything.""

It was clear he was looking down on us.

""Well what if it isn't just a fever? What will you do then?"" she replied angrily.

""Even if it was a fatal disease of the like, you couldn't even afford the bills anyway,""

That was the breaking point. It wasn't even like we were poor, no, in fact my father was the CEO of a company. Just because we were dressed casually and weren't wearing any jewellery or designer bags, he judged us as poor.

Even if he thought we were poor, he could have just given me a diagnosis and some medicines anyways, but he simply just didn't.

In the end, he gave me some pills to eat, though I didn't like his attitude at all, and his judgement of people. If it really had been a serious condition, I might have suffered more or even death due to his incompetence.",1,1749468193.0,u_Random_person088,0,1.0,False

Last 6 months heartburn like daily. So today i had a gastroscopy. And They found nothing. No inflammations, no hiernias, no barrets, no cancer nothing! They took som biopsises.

They Said my heartburn is most likely from stress and Anxiety.

Never smoked in my life, never drank alkohol in my life (only tasted vodka once when i was 18) I dont drink coffee. Only chai latte.

About the endoscopy experience. I've been afraid of this procedure for years and have cancelled over 10 previous appointments during these last 5 years! All for nothing because when i finally did it today (with sedation,propofol) it was one of the easiest things i've Done in my life! In less then 40 minutes after my appointment i was out of the clinic and waiting for my taxi. Haha!

My appointment was 11.20 am and by 12.00am i was outside standing on my own sipping on my sugarfree redbull waiting for the taxi.

So if anyone has an endoscopy planned. DONT cancel! Even if They dont find anything, it feels like a huge stone of stress has dropped of my shoulders now, now im at peace knowing that i have no cancer, no barrets which i was most afraid of and i was like 100% sure i have barrets due to 5+ years of troubles with heartburn.

The doctor that did the endoscopy was 80 years Old and most chill person i've met. We talked about watches after the procedure, he had a Rolex on him and i had too and had a Good laugh.

Anyways  i've taken ppis, pepcid, gaviscon etc during the years. Not everyday though. If anyone Wonders.",3,1749468073.0,Endoscopy,0,1.0,False

I want the Shadow Fang Pack to send a marking ceremony invitation to Dominic Sanchez.” My mother looked at me in disbelief. After all, my feelings for Dominic were genuine.....","The Silver Moon Pack was in ruins, and on the day my father, the Alpha, announced its downfall, he took his own life. In the chaos of my mother and I grieving, my father’s star protégé, Dominic Sanchez, the pack’s Beta, stepped forward, promising to mate with me and never abandon me. Yet, just a month after my father’s passing, I overheard him joking with his childhood friend, Serenity Taylor, an Omega of our pack. “When I said I’d mate with her, it was just to maintain my status. I couldn’t let the pack think I was ungrateful.” “My supposed affection for Ella Wells was all for show. I’ve always been waiting for you to come back home, Serenity.” “If I didn’t act like I was head over heels for Ella, would her father have divulged the secrets of the Silver Moon Pack?” The truth hit me like a bolt of lightning. Returning to our pack’s territory, I confronted my mother, the former Luna, “Mom, I agree to mate with Khalil Wells, but I have one condition. I want the Shadow Fang Pack to send a marking ceremony invitation to Dominic Sanchez.” My mother looked at me in disbelief. After all, my feelings for Dominic were genuine, nurtured over several years. “Ella, are you sure? I won’t force you if you don’t want to mate. With your father gone and our pack in shambles, I’m afraid you’ll face hardships.”

I shook my head. “Mom, I won’t. Khalil Wells is Dad’s childhood friend, and even though they haven’t stayed in touch for years, the fact that he’s willing to propose mating during our downfall speaks to his loyalty.”

Compared to the fickle Dominic Sanchez, Khalil, the Alpha of the Shadow Fang Pack, seemed far more dependable. I didn’t share the rest with my mother, just tried to compose myself, suppressing the whirlwind of emotions inside. My mother gave me a meaningful look before letting out a heavy sigh.

“So be it. I respect your decisions. The Shadow Fang Pack has set the marking ceremony for a week from now. Get ready, and we will move to their territory afterward.”

I nodded, and my mother gently patted my hand before leaving the room. The room fell silent once more, so quiet that I could distinctly hear my breathing. Tears fell uncontrollably, my heart constricted belatedly.

Dominic and I met when I was still a young werewolf. My father, the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, was also a respected mentor. Dominic was his prized student, joining the pack right after his awakening and rapidly becoming a rising star. The tale of a Lycan Princess and a promising Beta did not unfold for us.

In fact, my father was quite open-minded, never interfering with our relationship, even joking that he’d feel reassured if I mated with Dominic. For eight years, I thought our worlds had almost become one. Yet, I never realized I hadn’t entered his world at all. His apparent maturity and devotion were all merely acts.

If my father knew in the afterlife, he would surely support my decision to leave the Silver Moon Pack and Dominic Sanchez behind. The next day, I went back to the house that was supposed to be our mate’s den. I wanted to clean up and take away my things.

Staring at the empty bedside table in the master bedroom, I spaced out. It was supposed to display our marking ceremony photo, yet whenever I suggested we go prepare for the ceremony, Dominic made excuses about being swamped with pack duties. At the time, I understood his dedication, but now it seemed laughable.

Dominic wasn’t busy; he simply didn’t want to mark me as his mate. Suddenly, the sound of a key turning in the lock echoed. I composed myself and turned around, feigning surprise. “Why are you home so early today?”

Dominic looked worn out, but his eyes brightened when he saw me. “I wanted to spend more time with you.” He slowly came to my side, hesitated for a moment, and finally spoke. “Ella, I need to talk to you. Serenity is coming back tomorrow and doesn’t have a place to stay. We have a spare room, and I was thinking of letting her stay for a few days until she finds a place. Is that alright?”

Despite knowing the truth, hearing him voice those words made my chest ache with bitterness. Dominic sensed my long silence, appeared slightly anxious, worried I might refuse, and started explaining. “You know, Serenity is just an old friend. It’s not as complicated as you think. I ought to lend her a hand.”

Looking at Dominic’s earnest eyes, my heart was once again deeply pierced. He wanted to convince his intended mate to let another female werewolf live in our den—how incredibly ironic! But this matter was no longer important to me, as I was leaving in a week anyway.

I nodded indifferently, and Dominic, seeing my agreement, eagerly planted a kiss on my cheek. “Sweetheart, you’re wonderful! Mating with such a considerate Luna is truly my great fortune!”

Yes, it was your fortune, but my misfortune! He was entirely wrapped up in his joyful emotions, oblivious to his intended mate’s gloom beside him.

Chapter 2

There are six days until I leave.

Early in the morning, Beta Dominic left the house, well-dressed and even wearing cologne, clearly showing how much he valued this reunion. When he returned, he and Serenity Taylor were laughing and chatting, a bouquet of flowers in her arms, her laughter like music. But as soon as they crossed the threshold and saw me sitting in the living room, their laughter abruptly stopped.

Beta Dominic instinctively withdrew his arm from around Serenity's waist. ""Princess Ella, why aren’t you at the packhouse today?"" he asked, a mix of surprise and worry in his voice.

Pretending not to notice the intimacy he’d shown Serenity upon entering, I slowly lifted my gaze to meet his. ""Oh, Serenity came home today. I was waiting for you both so we could have lunch together.""

Had Beta Dominic looked more closely, he would have noticed that the photos of us together had all been removed. But his attention was solely on Serenity.

At the familiar restaurant, Beta Dominic naturally took a seat beside Serenity. I stared at the empty space next to me, feeling a pang of sadness. Serenity was dressed to impress, and Beta Dominic in his fine suit complemented her. Anyone would say how perfect they looked together. Meanwhile, I sat across from them in my ordinary clothes, feeling somewhat out of place.

The server's next words stripped away my last shred of dignity completely. ""Today, we have a special offer: couples who kiss for a minute get a 20% discount.""

The server, holding the menu, smiled warmly at Serenity and Beta Dominic, not even glancing my way.

""We aren’t..."" Beta Dominic glanced at me, his eyes filled with guilt and hesitation.

""Of course!"" Before anyone could react, Serenity had already placed her hands on Beta Dominic’s shoulders and kissed him.

Beta Dominic’s sideways glance at me showed that I appeared unfazed, which encouraged him to reciprocate Serenity’s kiss.

I forced a sardonic smile and lowered my gaze. I’d never realized just how excruciatingly slow a single minute could pass, feeling more like half a century. It was as if countless tiny blades were piercing my skin, deeply wounding every nerve with each passing second.

Finally, the server returned. ""Time’s up! Congratulations on your discount. If you need anything else, feel free to let me know."" With that, she left us, and the room suddenly felt unbearably tense.

""Serenity has been abroad for a while. Customs are different there, and maybe she’s not fully adapted yet..."" Beta Dominic’s voice trailed off as Serenity waved her hand dismissively.

""Oh, come on, you wouldn’t be that bothered, would you, Princess Ella? I do this kind of thing all the time overseas. If there was something between Beta Dominic and me, it would’ve happened already. Wouldn’t you agree?"" Serenity’s demeanor was friendly, yet her gaze carried a challenge, particularly emphasizing my title.

I took a sip of my coffee, laughing inwardly at the absurdity. People abroad don’t just kiss anyone. Did she think I was born yesterday?

Despite these thoughts, I chose to remain silent. I realized there was no longer any point in getting upset over them.

Seeing that I wasn’t angry, Beta Dominic visibly relaxed. He seemed to only now realize the situation and moved to sit next to me. I discreetly shifted my chair away.

""Princess Ella, don’t be so stingy. Serenity’s just a carefree spirit without any bad intentions,"" he said, placing food on my plate as he continued to explain, ""Serenity and I aren’t what you think. Please, don’t take it to heart.""

I cast a disinterested glance at Beta Dominic. ""Don’t worry. I won’t take it to heart.""

The old me might have flipped the table by now, but since agreeing to mate with Alpha Khalil, I found I truly didn’t care anymore.

Silently, I finished my meal of dinner rolls and pulled pork. When Beta Dominic went to pay, Serenity had her first chance to speak with me one-on-one.

Chapter 3

""I had always heard Dominic boast about how stunning his beloved was, but seeing her now felt like a completely different reality.""

""I’m struggling to see why the Beta was ever captivated by you. You look so downtrodden; it’s as if you’re merely the housekeeper.""

Serenity Taylor shot me a disdainful look, her eyes sharp and utterly unlike the meek presence she maintained around Dominic. I held her gaze, refusing to relent, even as the weight of her words pressed against my chest. My wolf stirred uneasily in the back of my mind, a low growl of frustration echoing in my thoughts.

""Serenity, don’t get too smug. What I am living now is what awaits you. Trust me, your future won’t be any better than mine.""

She chuckled, a sound so dismissive it sent shivers through me. ""You’re overreacting. I have no plans to mate with Dominic. You can keep pretending to be his Luna.""

Her words left me speechless, but what she said next was even more shattering.

""You don’t understand men. A mate isn’t as enticing as a mistress, and a mistress is never as thrilling as an affair. Men are always in pursuit of excitement.""

""If I were to mate with Dominic, that would truly mark the end of my romantic feelings.""

She rested her head in her hands, tilting it with a playful smile, despite the chilling nature of her words. I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pity. The woman Dominic had idealized was so calculated in their supposed relationship. But none of this mattered to me anymore.

For the next two days, whether Dominic and Serenity found my presence at home unbearable or if Serenity simply wanted to test my resilience, they didn’t return home for the night. This gave me the chance to pack my belongings. I wanted to leave with dignity, erasing all traces of myself from Dominic’s life.

While packing, a Tiffany ring box caught my eye. It was the very ring I had once mentioned to Dominic.

I had dreamed that when we mated, he would slide a Tiffany diamond ring onto my finger. This particular ring was known as ""The One,"" signifying a lifetime of exclusive love.

Was this ring meant for me?

With trembling hands, I cautiously opened the box. Inside lay a diamond ring, glittering in the sunlight, exactly the style I adored—the one called ""The One.""

For a moment, my heart hesitated. But upon seeing the initials engraved inside the ring, any lingering hope was extinguished.

Inside, the letters ""ST"" were clearly engraved—the initials of Serenity Taylor.

It seemed Dominic had remembered the Tiffany ring—a symbol of lifelong exclusive love—but bought it for his childhood sweetheart, Serenity.

Even though Serenity had been abroad for years, he had purchased it, waiting to slip it onto her finger once she returned.

I looked around at the home where I had spent four years, and suddenly everything seemed nonsensical. The walls that once felt like a sanctuary now felt like a prison, the air heavy with the weight of betrayal. My wolf whimpered softly, a quiet echo of the pain I refused to let surface.

My love had always been in vain.

Chapter 4

Dominic and Serenity returned the night before I was set to leave. The faint scent of wolfsbane clung to him, though he tried to mask it with his usual cologne. The red marks on his neck stood out like a sore thumb, and I couldn’t help but notice how Serenity’s floral scent—usually subtle—now seemed.............

We’re two brothers from Greece and we made a totally free app, for all of us who struggle to make friends and want to do activities.

We’ve both lived in big cities, and we know **how weirdly hard it can be to make friends as an adult especially in London**. You move to a new place, or your uni days are over, or your friends' schedules never line up and suddenly it’s just… you, wanting to do something but not knowing who to do it with.

Whether you’re a **student**, an **expat**, or just someone who wants to **get out more and meet good people**, we get it.

So we built **EasyGather,** a simple, free app where you can **join or create small group gatherings** (4–7 people) based on shared interests. From grabbing coffee or brunch, to seeing a movie, going for a walk, or hitting a pub, it’s all about making it easier to connect in real life, without the awkwardness.

It just launched today here in London, so there aren’t many users yet, but we’d love for you to be among the first to try it out and help shape the community.

If you’ve ever thought “I’d love to go, but I’ve got no one to go with” this is literally for you.

My property has very few amenities and the pool is probably our largest attraction. I'd really like to highlight it. However, I feel like my pool deck is missing something. I went pretty hard with trying to maximize the seating this year with this layout. I was thinking some lighting around the fencing, coffee table (or possibly a gas fire pit but that's just a wild idea dependant on regulations and liabilities) for the sectional area, ,but outside of that I'm drawing a blank.

I built a super-powered Snake game you can play in your browser.,"I'm excited to share a project I've been passionately working on. I've always loved the idea of having a fun, playable game right in the browser popup for those 5-minute breaks between meetings or to escape the doom-scrolling.

So, I made **Snake Shift**: my take on the classic snake game, reimagined for Chrome.

[Gameplay gif \(Speed x2\)](https://i.redd.it/urml4986xv5f1.gif)

It’s more than just the classic game; I've added a few twists:

* **🐍 Classic Snake, Modern Fu**n: The simple, addictive gameplay you love.
* **💥 Power-Up**s: Grab special items to boost your score and abilities.
* **🏆 Synced High Score**s: Your top scores are saved and synced across your Chrome browsers.
* **🔜 On The Wa**y: I'm already working on achievements/awards, more settings, and sound effects!

**Tech Stack**

For those interested in what's under the hood, the game is built with:

* **TypeScript & Vue 3:** For a robust structure and a reactive UI.
* **Phaser.js:** The fantastic game engine handling the core logic and rendering.
* **Service Worker:** Manages all background events and data persistence.
* `IndexedDB` **&** `chrome.storage.sync`**:** Used for saving and syncing high scores and settings across your devices.

**Interesting Challenges**

A couple of the more challenging (and fun!) parts of this project were:

* **Generic Power-Up System:** Designing a system that allows new power-ups to be added easily in the future without rewriting core logic.
* **Sign-up Free Syncing:** Creating a method to uniquely identify a user and sync their data (like high scores and achievements) across browsers, without requiring any login or external services.
* **Efficient Award System:** Building a system for achievements that stores and syncs a user's awards efficiently using a binary bitmap.

I've just released an **alpha build (v2.1.2)** and would love to get your feedback. You can try it out directly from the Chrome Web Store:

1l720mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Matter-8017/comments/1l720mf/2_rupees_coffee_and_varanasi/,"2 Rupees, coffee and Varanasi.","2 Rupees, Coffee and Varanasi.

If she doesn’t like coffee, don’t even bother to go on a date with her. This was an advice from a wise man, do I follow this advice? I don’t know, but without coffee, how can you define paradise? This story starts in Mccleodganj from Coffee talk.

Coffee talk somehow reminds me of the Karate Kid movie and Miyagi. As for the Tibetan uncle, if he loses hair, he will look like Miyagi. Some months back, his shop was closed, and when he opened again, I went and told him, ""Next time when you close, please put a date so that we will know when we can come for your coffee."" He didn’t know what to say. Anyway, the story is not about him either.

When I came out of coffee talk, I saw two dark men covered in ash, begging for 2 rupees. And my mind went back to Varanasi. Yes, this is a story about Aghoris and their life. Are these two guys, Aghoris? I don’t know, and I don’t care either. You are not going to become poor by giving them 2 rupees, and they are not going to become rich by accepting those 2 rupees either. The moment I gave them 2 rs, I was mentally transported to a point in time which I can never forget in this life.

Gateway Hotels knows what they do, and their local guides know the nuances of that magical city. Yes, Kashi or Varanasi is indeed magic to me, just like every part of this mystical, mythical nation stretching from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari. This whole land is a mystery, and you will need a thousand lives to experience it. This great land has accepted everyone, irrespective of their color, language, and faith. India is an international hostel, and it will be for years to come. If you think you can hate this country for “n” reasons, she will give you “n+1” reasons to fall in love with her again.

There are many books written about Aghoris. You can read them and try to understand them. I don’t try to understand any faith in India. I am a traveler, and I love to observe, and if possible, I will try to freeze that experience for myself. This group of men was termed as Aghoris, and it is said they ate human flesh. People feared them—mostly naked, with ash from dead bodies covering them, and they smoked ganja or marijuana. This is the general opinion about them: just naked, weed-smoking barbaric people. How we love to generalize!

The local guide—I forgot his name—took me on a joyride on the river Ganga. For them, it was Ma Ganga. I respect their faith, and I went on that amazing ride. I have seen the Hwang Ho in China and the Brahmaputra in India, so I was not astonished by the breadth of Ganga, but for my friends who hadn’t seen such rivers, it was a magical experience.

Jules, being a hippie and a weed smoker—I don’t hate him for that, but I don’t love him for other things either—had read about Aghoris and wanted to see them. The local guide was ready to arrange it, of course, for money. I have seen many crazy things in my life, but this one experience changed something in me forever.

After 11 p.m., he took us in a car. Then we walked. It was by the river Ganga, a small, secluded place, and there was music and dance. Trust me, it was a phenomenal experience. I have experienced even the monkey stereo in the dense jungles of Cambodia, but this one had no speakers, just plain drumbeats, more African. Jules, being Jules, jumped into dancing mode. The tempo was rising, and there was definitely something in the air. Then, all of a sudden, the drumming stopped, and one Aghori jumped into the river. There was a body floating. He swam to it and brought it to their place.

The head Aghori touched it and discarded it. They threw the body back into the river, and the drumbeats started again. The tempo rose, everyone around me was dancing, some of them naked with ashes all over, and the head Aghori, I noticed, had a human skull next to him. He was in a lotus position, and he called me through his hands. Like an obedient kid, I went to him and sat in front of him. He smiled, and there was something so beautiful in that smile. Even till this day, I haven’t experienced such a childish yet powerful smile. He gave me a joint or cigar or whatever. I refused, but I touched his feet in reverence. Other than my mom, I have never knelt for anyone, but this man was a magnet.

He asked whether I feared him. I simply smiled. Then the music stopped again. Silence. Another Aghori jumped into the river, and they brought him a body. Again, the same spectacle. He touched it, this time he smiled, and the drums erupted like a roaring lion. He got up and started dancing. Oh man, this was Shiva’s Rudra Tandava in full galore. He was jumping, and he matched the tempo of the drums. Then one guy used his machete and cut the body.

Jules held on to my hands, and I am not going to write further about what happened. Jules was in no dancing mood for sure, and whatever he smoked, I think, was not helping him as he started shaking. My uncle was a renowned doctor, and I have assisted him in postmortems, so I didn’t experience fear.Cadaver. I could only think about Epicurus: “Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here.” But Jules had other plans, or should I say, Jules not only literally but technically wet his pants. I was so angry, but I couldn’t blame him after what we witnessed.

After their “ dinner” , the head of that group called me to sit with him. He was like a lion after the feast. I sat in front of him. Did I have fear, or was I thinking about Shiva? Or was I witnessing Shiva in front of me? Or was it the weed in the air, which was playing with my senses? Till this day, I don’t know.

Aghori: “Do you fear me?” he asked in Hindi.  
Me: I just kept my mouth shut.

Then he spoke in Tamil, to my astonishment, most of these heads of such groups are multilinguals and to this day, I don’t know how he recognized me a Tamil. I had read every one of J. Krishnamurti’s books. In fact, he was the only philosopher who spoke to me, but what this naked man told me was like Eklavya. If you don’t know about Eklavya, I will tell you about him, but not now.

Aghori:  
“You shouldn’t fear me, as I eat something which is already dead. I should fear you, as you kill plants and animals which are alive and eat them.”

He made me realize who the ""barbarian"" really was.

Prologue:  
Shiva is seen as a mystic who came from heaven and landed in Manasarovar by many people in the South. His abode, Kailash, is what they call the Himalayas. There are three paths to understand Shiva, and Aghoris follow the least used path, feared and respected at the same time. The Cholas, my kings who ruled the South, created temples for him, and when the kings of the North sent their daughters and sisters to the Mughals, we sent our women as suicide squads so the temples are safe till this day, and we are as dark as the Shiva inside our temples.

I wouldn’t like to dwell much into it; rather, I simply understood who the barbarian is. And so should you…

Jules walked back to the hotel for “obvious pant” reasons along with the local guide. Gateway hotels indeed opened another gateway in my mind . And when I concluded this story, Spotify played “Soul sister”, this time I was not angry. I listened, I think I am transgressing the pain.

* **Sign-up Free Syncing:** Creating a method to uniquely identify a user and sync their data (like high scores and achievements) across browsers, without requiring any login or external services.
* **Efficient Award System:** Building a system for achievements that stores and syncs a user's awards efficiently using a binary bitmap.

My SO gifted me DAK beans, so i am trying to make the best out of it. I didn't want to tell her the roast date has been a little longer than i normally aim for, but 6 weeks beans we still do okay right.

The shots run extremely fast 10 sec prefinsue, and another 10-14 seconds and its done to 1:2 or 1:2.5 ratio. The pressure only builds up to 5 bar. My first shot at 18.1 gr in and the initial grind setting was smooth to some extent, watery, and sweetness didn't stick for long. Bitter at the end lingered. Hence i figured for the second attempt to extract more 'mid'-shot by grinder finer and cut output shorter to prevent bitterness.

To my surprise, the second shot ran faster. Immediately hit with acidity, followed by harshness. Is this an underextraction? I couldn't recognise defects from the bottomless pf as it run so fast. Didn't see channelling perse.   All the variables I changed for the second shot should have promoted an increase in extraction but it didn't. I don't think going coarser is the route, as the pressure build up is at 5 bar low already.

My setup:

* Lelit Mara X, descaler, relatively good quality dutch tap water, temp mode I 92C-94Cish. OPV set for 8 bar boiler pressure.
* Pullman Filtration876 precision basket 17-19 gr
* wdt
* level tamping, either with normal tamper or normcor 
* DF64 gen 1, SSP HU burs, aligned myself with a couple of shims.

Since I got the Pullman basket, extraction time has drastically decreased, which I understand is expected with precision baskets. Results have been.. varying. Also with a simple medium roast blend coffee, i moreover don't even dare to serve it to my family, who just expect a classic. Shots turn out overly harsh. 

I am 5 years into my espresso journey, thought i learned a lot. But realise tasting coffee becomes increasingly difficult and frustrating. I start doubting myself, do I taste floral or sourness, is this over or under extracted? One thing is certain, I have flashy gear, expensive beans, but distasteful coffee.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a mug rug depend on several key features. Understanding these aspects allows for a more informed purchase.

**Material Composition:** The material dictates the mug rugS heat resistance, absorbency, durability, and overall aesthetic. Common options include cotton,wool,felt,cork,silicone,and ceramic. Each material offers different strengths and weaknesses.

For example, cotton is highly absorbent but may not offer the best heat resistance. Wool is naturally insulating and water-repellent but can be more expensive. Cork is eco-friendly and provides excellent grip but may stain easily. Silicone is heat-resistant and easy to clean but lacks the textural charm of other materials.Ceramic offers superior heat resistance and can be visually striking, but it's also prone to breaking. Consider your needs and preferences when choosing a material.

**Dimensions and Shape:** mug rugs come in various sizes and shapes,from classic squares and circles to more elaborate geometric designs and custom shapes. The ideal size should comfortably accommodate your largest mug or cup with some room to spare.

A standard size is typically around 5-7 inches in diameter or width. The shape should complement the overall design of your workspace or living area. Consider the mugs you will generally be using on the placemat from smaller tea-cups, all the way to larger drinking vessels. A mug rug should accommodate the most commonly used mug along with a buffer area to prevent any spills from running onto the table.

**Heat Resistance:** A primary function of a mug rug is to protect surfaces from heat damage. The heat resistance of a mug rug depends on the material used and its construction. Some materials, like silicone and ceramic, offer substantially higher heat resistance than others, like cotton or felt.

Look for mug rugs specifically labeled as heat-resistant if you frequently use very hot beverages. Be wary of mug rugs that appear to be made from heat-resistant materials, but are actually composed of low-quality materials or do not have the proper backing. A general test that buyers can perform upon receiving the place mat is to place a standard mug filled with boiling water for a few minutes, and then check underneath the placemat with some paper-towels for any condensed rings.

**Absorbency:** Spills are inevitable, so a mug rug's absorbency is crucial. Highly absorbent materials like cotton, wool, and microfiber can quickly soak up spills, preventing them from spreading and staining surfaces.

Consider the thickness and density of the material; thicker, denser materials tend to be more absorbent.Some mug rugs also feature a waterproof backing to prevent liquids from seeping through to the surface below. This becomes exceptionally important if your work desk is generally composed of materials that are easily spoiled such as bare wooden tables,or sensitive electronic products.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Mug rugs are not just functional; they're also decorative.They come in a wide range of designs, from minimalist and modern to rustic and whimsical. Choose designs that complement your existing decor and personal style.

Consider the colour,pattern,and texture of the mug rug. Handcrafted mug rugs often feature unique details and embellishments, such as embroidery, quilting, or appliques, adding a touch of artistry to your space. Some more common designs include minimalistic patterns, coffee related patterns, or even custom patterns.

## Core Benefits

Using mug rugs offers a range of benefits beyond simply protecting your furniture.

**surface Protection:** the most obvious benefit is the protection of surfaces from heat rings, scratches, and spills.Hot beverages can leave unsightly rings on wood furniture, while condensation can damage delicate finishes.A mug rug provides a barrier against these potential damages.

As a notable example, without a mug rug, a hot cup of tea could easily mar the finish of a wooden desk, requiring costly repairs or refinishing. A mug rug effectively prevents this damage, preserving the beauty and integrity of your furniture.Furthermore, should a spill of liquid occur, many mug rugs can absorb the initial amount of liquid that would normally stain materials such as clothes, sensitive papers or electronics, along with other table materials.

**Enhanced Aesthetics:** Mug rugs add a touch of style and personality to any space. They can be used to complement existing decor, add a pop of color, or create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

A thoughtfully chosen mug rug can elevate the look of a coffee table, desk, or dining table. For example, a set of colorful ceramic mug rugs can brighten up a minimalist workspace, while a rustic quilted mug rug can add warmth to a farmhouse-style kitchen. By the same token, a custom pattern mug rug featuring a design that is personally sentimental can improve the owner's mood on a daily basis when regularly used.

**Improved Hygiene:** By containing spills and preventing drips, mug rugs help maintain a cleaner and more hygienic surroundings. They can also prevent the spread of germs and bacteria.

Instead of letting spills drip onto a work surface or desk area, where bacteria can fester, mug rugs absorb the liquid and can be easily cleaned and sanitized. This can be notably critically important in shared workspaces or homes with young children or pets. The ability of most mug rugs to be easily washed and sanitized will assist in making for a more hygienic environment with a particularly pronounced effect in the work area.

**Noise Reduction:** Some mug rugs,especially those made from thicker materials like felt or cork,can help reduce noise caused by placing mugs and cups on hard surfaces.

The extra layer of cushioning prevents the harsh clanging sound that can occur when placing a mug directly on a table, creating a more peaceful and relaxing environment. This is particularly helpful in quiet offices or homes with sensitive hearing. Additionally, this extra layer of cushioning is capable of preventing scratches from accumulating on the bare surface as the cups are dragged across the bare table or desk surface.

**Versatility:** Mug rugs are not limited to mugs and cups. They can also be used as small placemats for snacks, candle holders, or decorative accents.

Their versatility makes them a practical and stylish addition to any home or office. For example, a decorative mug rug can be used to showcase a small potted plant or protect a table from a hot serving dish.

* **Frost** said, ""If I don’t start as soon as I get up, I won’t do it.""

In my case, to make sure I get started, I scheduled a yoga class in the morning. That way, I had to get up on Saturday **because I’d already paid.** No excuses!

* **Yak** said, ""Pre-timeblocking helps me. And I make sure to time-block in my time-wasters and lounging."" So, in addition to my morning yoga, I made plans with a friend for dinner. That way, I knew I had to get out and be productive.

After I got myself out the door, I took some books and a notebook to a coffee shop near my dinner spot, did some reading, and took some notes.

* **Wealthy** said, ""But to get anything done: keep your phone away!!"" So, during my reading time, I made sure to put my phone away. And guess what? I actually did it! 😄

It worked for me, and I’m super happy to share my experience with everyone who might be interested in trying something similar.

Some told Eckard their factories could be idled by mid-July without backup magnet supplies. ""The whole car industry is in full panic,"" said Eckard, CEO of Magnosphere, based in Troisdorf, Germany. ""They are willing to pay any price.""

Car executives have once again been driven into their war rooms, concerned that China's tight export controls on rare-earth magnets – crucially needed to make cars – could cripple production. U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to let rare earths minerals and magnets flow to the United States. A U.S. trade team is scheduled to meet Chinese counterparts for talks in London on Monday.

The industry worries that the rare-earths situation could cascade into the third massive supply chain shock in five years. A semiconductor shortage wiped away millions of cars from automakers' production plans, from roughly 2021 to 2023. Before that, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 shut factories for weeks.

Those crises prompted the industry to fortify supply chain strategies. Executives have prioritized backup supplies for key components and reexamined the use of just-in-time inventories, which save money but can leave them without stockpiles when a crisis unfurls.

Judging from Eckard's inbound calls, though, ""nobody has learned from the past,"" he said.

This time, as the rare-earths bottleneck tightens, the industry has few good options, given the extent to which China dominates the market. The fate of automakers' assembly lines has been left to a small team of Chinese bureaucrats as it reviews hundreds of applications for export permits.

Several European auto-supplier plants have already shut down, with more outages coming, said the region's auto supplier association, CLEPA.

""Sooner or later, this will confront everyone,"" said CLEPA Secretary-General Benjamin Krieger.

Cars today use rare-earths-based motors in dozens of components – side mirrors, stereo speakers, oil pumps, windshield wipers, and sensors for fuel leakage and braking sensors.

China controls up to 70% of global rare-earths mining, 85% of refining capacity and about 90% of rare-earths metal alloy and magnet production, consultancy AlixPartners said. The average electric vehicle uses about .5 kg (just over 1 pound) of rare earths elements, and a fossil-fuel car uses just half that, according to the International Energy Agency.

China has clamped down before, including in a 2010 dispute with Japan, during which it curbed rare-earths exports. Japan had to find alternative suppliers, and by 2018, China accounted for only 58% of its rare earth imports. ""China has had a rare-earth card to play whenever they wanted to,"" said Mark Smith, CEO of mining company NioCorp, which is developing a rare-earth project in Nebraska scheduled to start production within three years. Across the industry, automakers have been trying to wean off China for rare-earth magnets, or even develop magnets that do not need those elements. But most efforts are years away from the scale needed.

""It's really about identifying ... and finding alternative solutions"" outside China, Joseph Palmieri, head of supply chain management at supplier Aptiv, said at a conference in Detroit last week.

Automakers including General Motors and BMW and major suppliers such as ZF and BorgWarner are working on motors with low-to-zero rare-earth content, but few have managed to scale production enough to cut costs.

The EU has launched initiatives including the Critical Raw Materials Act to boost European rare-earth sources. But it has not moved fast enough, said Noah Barkin, a senior advisor at Rhodium Group, a China-focused U.S. think tank.

Even players that have developed marketable products struggle to compete with Chinese producers on price.

David Bender, co-head of German metal specialist Heraeus' magnet recycling business, said it is only operating at 1% capacity and will have to close next year if sales do not increase.

Minneapolis-based Niron has developed rare-earth free magnets and has raised more than $250 million from investors including GM, Stellantis and auto supplier Magna.

""We've seen a step change in interest from investors and customers"" since China's export controls took effect, CEO Jonathan Rowntree said. It is planning a $1 billion plant scheduled to start production in 2029.

England-based Warwick Acoustics has developed rare-earth-free speakers expected to appear in a luxury car later this year. CEO Mike Grant said the company has been in talks with another dozen automakers, although the speakers are not expected to be available in mainstream models for about five years.

***As auto companies scout longer-term solutions, they are left scrambling to avert imminent factory shutdowns.***

***Automakers must figure out which of their suppliers – and smaller ones a few links up the supply chain – need export permits. Mercedes-Benz, for example, is talking to suppliers about building rare-earth stockpiles.***

***Analysts said the constraints could force automakers to make cars without certain parts and park them until they become available, as GM and others did during the semiconductor crisis.***

***Automakers' reliance on China does not end with rare earth elements. A 2024 European Commission report said China controls more than 50% of global supply of 19 key raw materials, including manganese, graphite and aluminum.***

***Andy Leyland, co-founder of supply chain specialist SC Insights, said any of those elements could be used as leverage by China. ""This just is a warning shot,"" he said.***

# JUNE 9th, 2025~US and China set to meet for trade talks in London

[US and China set to meet for trade talks in London](https://www.kbc.co.ke/us-and-china-set-to-meet-for-trade-talks-in-london/)

https://preview.redd.it/6fq33gp5mv5f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=8575a1379303ceb4646fa1242e2edaf11895e7d5

**A new round of talks aimed at resolving a trade war between the US and China is set take place in London on Monday.**

US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that a senior US delegation would meet Chinese representatives. Over the weekend, Beijing confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks.

The announcements came after Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping had a phone conversation last week, which the US president described as a “very good talk”.

Last month, the world’s two biggest economies agreed a temporary truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between them, but since then both countries have accused the other of breaching the deal.

Trump said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would meet Chinese officials in London on Monday.

On Saturday, China’s foreign ministry said Vice Premier He would be in the UK between 8 and 13 June, and that a meeting of the “China-US economic and trade mechanism” would take place.

The new round of negotiations came after Trump said his phone conversation with Xi on Thursday mainly focused on trade and had “resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries”.

According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Xi told Trump that the US should “withdraw the negative measures it has taken against China”.

The call was the first time the two leaders had spoken since the trade war erupted in February.

When Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from a number of countries earlier this year, China was the hardest hit. Beijing responded with its own higher rates on US imports, and this triggered tit-for-tat increases that peaked at 145%.

In May, talks held in Switzerland led to a temporary truce that Trump called a “total reset”.

It brought US tariffs on Chinese products down to 30%, while Beijing slashed levies on US imports to 10% and promised to lift barriers on critical mineral exports.

The US had suspended sales of some technology to China including semiconductors while Beijing had restricted exports of rare earth minerals and magnets.

Swetha Ramachandran, fund manager at Artemis, told the BBC’s Today programme that the inclusion of Lutnick in the talks was a “welcome addition” since he was “behind some of the very harsh export controls of technology to China”.

“And some of the focus certainly seems to be on rare earths where China, of course, has dominance in terms of producing,” she said.

“They mine 69% of the rare earths globally that are quite essential to technology development in the US so I think there are enough chips on the table here that could make it acceptable for both sides to walk away with desired outcomes.”

The agreement made in May gave both sides a 90-day deadline to try to reach a trade deal.

The latest data released by Bejing on Monday showed China’s exports in May were lower than analysts expected, despite the truce.

China’s exports in dollar terms increased by 4.8% compared to the same time last year.

At the same time imports dropped by 3.4%, which was much worse than the 0.9% fall predicted.

But since then, relations appeared to have soured. Last month, Trump said China had “totally violated its agreement with us”, and then a few days later China said the US had “severely violated” the agreement.

The US accused China of failing to restart shipments of critical minerals and rare earth magnets vital to car and computer industries.

On Saturday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it had approved some applications for rare earth export licences, although it did not provide details of which countries involved.

The announcement came after Trump said on Friday that Xi had agreed to restart trade in rare earth materials.

Bu speaking on Sunday, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CBS News that “those exports of critical minerals have been getting released at a rate that is, you know, higher than it was, but not as high as we believe we agreed to in Geneva”.

I’ll be upfront with you—I never thought I’d be the kind of person to talk publicly about my bathroom habits. But after four months of using Colon Broom, I feel like I’d be doing a disservice by staying quiet. If you’re someone who deals with bloating, sluggish digestion, or just a general feeling of heaviness after meals, then what I’m about to share might help you out a lot.

So here’s my personal journey with Colon Broom—what I liked, what I didn’t, how it made me feel, and most importantly, whether it actually worked.

# Why I Tried Colon Broom in the First Place

# Let’s rewind a bit.

For the last few years, I’ve had an on-again-off-again relationship with constipation. Nothing severe or chronic, but enough to make me feel bloated, uncomfortable, and low on energy more often than I’d like. I eat relatively healthy, drink a fair amount of water, and get some exercise, but something was still off.

After one particularly bad week of digestive sluggishness and feeling like I was carrying around an invisible 5-pound weight in my gut, I started searching for a natural solution. I stumbled across Colon Broom through a Facebook post, and after falling down a rabbit hole of user reviews, I figured I’d give it a try.

What caught my attention?

* It's based on **psyllium husk**, a soluble fiber I’d heard good things about.
* It claims to support **regular bowel movements**, reduce **bloating**, and even help with **weight loss** and **detoxification**.
* Most importantly, it wasn’t some harsh laxative. I didn’t want anything that would have me rushing to the bathroom or wrecking my gut microbiome.

# My First Impression

When my first bottle of Colon Broom arrived, I was kind of surprised by how clinical the packaging looked. Very clean and minimalistic—not screaming “detox tea” or “quick weight loss miracle” like so many sketchy products do. That was a good sign.

The directions were simple: mix one scoop (or teaspoon) of the powder with 8 ounces of water, drink it, then follow it with another full glass of water. Do this once a day for the first week, then optionally bump up to twice a day.

I started with one scoop in the evening, about an hour after dinner.

The taste? Honestly, not bad. It has a slightly sweet, fruity flavor—kind of like a mild strawberry lemonade. I could tell it was sweetened with **stevia**, which I’m used to, so no complaints there. Texture-wise, you definitely need to drink it fairly quickly, or it turns into a jelly-like consistency. That’s the psyllium husk doing its thing.

# What’s Actually in Colon Broom?

Let’s talk ingredients, because that’s what sold me.

1. **Psyllium Husk** – This is the star of the show. It’s a fiber from the seeds of the Plantago Ovata plant. When mixed with water, it forms a gel-like substance in your gut, which helps bulk up stool and makes it easier to pass. It’s also known to support heart health and reduce cholesterol.
2. **Citric Acid** – Naturally found in citrus fruits, it aids digestion and adds that tangy flavor.
3. **Crystallized Lemon** – Rich in vitamin C and antioxidants. Supposedly supports immunity and helps with fat metabolism.
4. **Sea Salt** – Helps regulate fluid balance and promotes healthy digestion.
5. **Stevia Leaf Extract** – A natural, zero-calorie sweetener.
6. **Sucralose** – Another sweetener, though I was a bit surprised this was included. It's artificial, but used in very small quantities.
7. **Silicon Dioxide** – An anti-caking agent found in nature. Also plays a role in digestive and cardiovascular support.

# The First Few Days: Mild Bloating, Then Relief

**Day 1 and 2:** I felt a little gassy after the first two doses. Not painful, but definitely more air in my stomach than usual. The directions did warn about this—it’s your body adjusting to the sudden increase in fiber. I wasn’t too worried.

**By day 3:** My bloating had actually decreased, and I had my first satisfying bowel movement in days. Not explosive. Not urgent. Just… easy. That was a relief (literally and figuratively).

**By the end of the first week**: I was going to the bathroom regularly every morning. My stomach felt lighter. The sluggish, heavy feeling I usually had after lunch was gone. I didn’t feel “stuffed” all the time.

# The Second Week: Feeling the Difference

Around day 10, I noticed something unexpected—I had more energy.

Now, I’m not saying this is some miracle energy supplement, but when you’re not carrying around digestive discomfort all day, it’s amazing how much lighter you feel overall. My productivity improved. I wasn’t reaching for a second coffee just to stay awake.

Also worth noting: I was sleeping better. I didn’t wake up feeling as groggy or bloated.

This might be tied to Colon Broom’s claims about improving your **gut microbiome**. I can’t prove that scientifically, but from experience, I felt a difference. Less indigestion. Less burping. Fewer sugar cravings.

# Weight Loss?

Let’s be clear—Colon Broom is not a weight loss product. However, within three months, I had already lost about 9 pounds.

Some of that could have been water weight. Some might’ve come from being more regular. And some of it was likely from fewer late-night snacks and cravings. I wasn’t ravenous in the evening like I usually am.

It didn’t melt fat away. But it made it easier to stick to healthier habits, and that counts for something.

# How I Used It

Here’s what worked best for me:

* One scoop in water first thing in the morning before breakfast.
* A second scoop (optional) around 4 p.m., before dinner.
* Always followed each serving with another full glass of water.
* I didn’t change my diet much—just tried to eat a little cleaner and walk more.

# The Side Effects

Let’s talk drawbacks.

* **Initial bloating**: Like I said, the first few days were a little gassy. But it passed quickly.
* **Need to drink lots of water**: If you don’t follow each dose with another glass, you might feel constipated or too full.
* **Price**: It’s not cheap. A single bottle is $69.99, but the price drops with bulk purchases or subscriptions. I got the 3-bottle bundle and paid around $45 per bottle.
* **Sucralose**: I wish they had skipped this ingredient. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, but some people try to avoid artificial sweeteners.

# Other Perks I Noticed

Besides the obvious digestive improvements, there were some surprising benefits:

* **Skin clarity**: I’m not saying it cleared up my acne, but I did notice fewer breakouts. Might be due to less inflammation or better nutrient absorption.
* **Mood**: I felt less irritable and more even-keeled. Again, hard to directly attribute to the product, but the connection between gut health and mood is well-documented.
* **Less bloating during my period**: This was a huge one for me. Normally I get really puffy and uncomfortable, but the second month on Colon Broom, I barely noticed.

# Who Should Consider Using It?

Based on my experience, Colon Broom might be a good fit for you if:

* You struggle with **constipation or irregular bowel movements**.
* You feel **bloated, heavy, or sluggish** most days.
* You want a **natural fiber supplement** that actually tastes decent.
* You’re looking for **gentle detox** and **digestive reset**, without resorting to harsh laxatives or fad cleanses.

It might not be for you if:

* You can’t tolerate psyllium or other fiber supplements.
* You’re extremely sensitive to sweeteners like stevia or sucralose.
* You’re expecting it to be a magic weight loss cure. (It’s not.)

# My Final Verdict

After 4 months of using Colon Broom daily, I’m sticking with it.

I’ve never had such consistent, comfortable digestion in my adult life. The bloating is gone, my energy is up, and I’ve shed a few pounds without making any radical changes. My gut just feels better—plain and simple.

Is it perfect? No. I wish it were a little cheaper. And I’d love an option without sucralose. But compared to other fiber products I’ve tried (looking at you, chalky Metamucil), Colon Broom is hands-down the best experience I’ve had.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Especially if you’ve been quietly struggling with your digestion like I was.

If you do try it, give it at least 2–3 weeks to really start noticing the changes. And drink. Your. Water.

**Where to Buy**

I got mine directly from the official Colon Broom website. They offer bundles, free shipping options, and a 30-day refund window (though I never needed to use it).

**Pro Tip**: If you’re planning to stick with it, the 3-month or 6-month bundle saves a good chunk of money.

**TL;DR – My Colon Broom Experience in a Nutshell**

* **✅ Regular, smooth bowel movements**
* **✅ Less bloating and heaviness**
* **✅ Mild appetite suppression**
* **✅ Noticeable energy and mood boost**
* **✅ Easy to use and tastes surprisingly good**
* **⚠️ Requires consistency and plenty of water**
* **⚠️ Some bloating early on**
* **⚠️ Not a weight loss supp.**
* **⚠️ A bit pricey without a subscription**

Would I buy it again? I already did.

Let your gut be the judge—but for me, Colon Broom was just what I needed.

# Understanding Your Space

Creating a guestroom suite on a tight budget begins with a thorough evaluation of the available spaces within your home. Before embarking on any design plans, it is essential to identify areas that can be repurposed to accommodate guests. Common options might include a spare bedroom, a seldom-used home office, or even transitional spaces like a basement or attic, which can be transformed into inviting guest accommodations.

Begin by measuring the dimensions of the potential space. Accurate measurements will assist you in planning the layout effectively, ensuring that you maximize the functionality while adhering to budget constraints. During this process, it is vital to assess the amount of natural light the area receives, as lighting influences the overall ambiance. A well-lit space not only enhances comfort but also makes the room feel more welcoming for your guests.

Attention to existing furniture is equally important. Consider whether any furniture can be repurposed to fit the new guestroom suite. For instance, an old sofa could be reupholstered or turned into a comfortable sleeper couch, thus saving you from purchasing additional furnishings. Engage with top interior designers in Indore who specialize in creating budget-friendly designs. They can provide insights on how to best utilize your current resources while making necessary enhancements to the space.

Accessibility is another significant factor; ensure the guestroom suite is conveniently located in relation to the rest of the home to facilitate ease of movement for your guests. After identifying the most suitable space and taking into account all these elements, you can confidently proceed with creating a welcoming environment that embodies both comfort and functionality. This thoughtful planning will enable you to craft a stylish guestroom that reflects the qualities of the best interior designers in Indore while being mindful of budget constraints.

# Setting a Budget 

https://preview.redd.it/q1s6c5lysv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ec7f014702bc586244d6aee9cf94d365c017831

When planning the design of a guestroom suite, defining a clear budget is crucial to ensure financial feasibility without sacrificing style. The first step is to establish the total amount you are willing to spend. Consider all potential expenses, which may include furniture, decor, linens, and any necessary renovations. A comprehensive breakdown of these expenditures can help you remain within budget while achieving your desired outcome.

Begin by making a list of essential items for your guestroom suite. This entails identifying the must-have furniture such as a comfortable bed, nightstands, and perhaps a dresser. You may also need to account for basic decor elements like curtains and rugs, which contribute significantly to the overall ambiance. Following this, prioritize these elements by distinguishing between essentials and non-essentials; for instance, a high-quality mattress is a necessity, while accent pieces may be considered optional upgrades.

To effectively navigate the constraints of a tight budget, consider various strategies that can keep costs down. Shopping secondhand is a practical approach, as many thrift stores and online marketplaces feature gently used furniture and decor items at a fraction of their original price. Moreover, DIY methods can be employed for certain decor elements or small renovations, allowing for personal touches without significant financial investment. If buying new, be vigilant in seeking out sales and discounts, especially from reputable [**Interior designers in Indore**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-indore/) who may offer seasonal promotions.

By carefully planning your budget, prioritizing necessary items, and exploring cost-saving avenues, you can create a beautiful guestroom suite without overspending. This disciplined approach enables you to work with both established interior designers in Indore and innovative DIY ideas, ultimately delivering a welcoming atmosphere for your guests that reflects thoughtful planning and design.

# Choosing Essential Furniture 

https://preview.redd.it/twnk7zszsv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3688063ad721d372ffdc04cabd5ff408b33bb32

When creating a guestroom suite on a tight budget, selecting essential furniture items is crucial to ensure a comfortable and functional space for visitors. The primary piece to consider is a comfortable bed or sofa bed, as it provides a restful place for guests to sleep. A sofa bed is a versatile option that can serve as both seating and sleeping space, thereby maximizing functionality without compromising on comfort. For those looking to save even more, exploring budget-friendly options among the best interior designers in Indore can lead to valuable recommendations on where to find affordable choices.

Nightstands are another essential item to include in the guestroom suite. They provide a convenient surface for guests to place their belongings, such as phones, glasses, and books. To maintain a tidy appearance, consider multifunctional nightstands that offer additional storage options. Many [**interior designers in Indore for home**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-indore/) projects emphasize the importance of efficient storage solutions, so look for designs that incorporate drawers or shelves to help keep the space organized.

Storage solutions are integral for hosting guests, particularly in smaller areas. Invest in furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes, such as ottomans with hidden storage or shelving units that can act as room dividers. This approach not only helps in maximizing space but also adds a stylish element to the suite. Thrift stores and online marketplaces can be excellent sources for affordable yet chic furniture. Prioritize scouting these places to discover unique pieces that align with your budget and aesthetic goals.

The arrangement of the furniture can also significantly affect the overall ambiance and functionality of the guestroom. Ensuring there is ample space for movement and accessibility is vital. Consider placing the bed away from the door to suggest privacy and create a welcoming atmosphere. By implementing creative layouts and focusing on essential, multifunctional furniture, you can develop a cozy and efficient guestroom suite within budget constraints.

# Incorporating Versatile Decor 

https://preview.redd.it/8arya311tv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae31de74a4e15026ef11435f94bd76c23b3b5bc

When designing a guestroom suite on a tight budget, the selection of decor can significantly influence the overall ambiance. Incorporating versatile decor elements will not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also allow for easy changes when necessary. A great starting point is to choose a cohesive color scheme that is both inviting and neutral, creating a relaxing environment for guests. Soft tones such as pastels or earthy hues can serve as a backdrop that complements various decor styles.

Wall art is another crucial component that can be both stylish and budget-friendly. DIY projects can add a personal touch and have become increasingly popular among homeowners. For instance, creating canvas prints from cherished family photos or abstract paintings can serve as meaningful decor. Additionally, you may consider framing fabric swatches or inexpensive prints found in local markets to lend character without breaking the bank. These art pieces can reflect the personality of the space, making it feel unique and welcoming to visitors.

When it comes to soft furnishings, choosing durable and washable fabric for curtains and cushions can offer both practicality and style. Fabrics in solid colors or simple patterns can create a sophisticated look while being easy to switch out as trends change. By opting for multifunctional decorative items, such as reversible cushions or curtains with pockets for storage, you can enhance the usability of the guestroom suite. Personal touches, such as a small selection of books, fresh flowers, or handmade items, can also add warmth to the room and make your guests feel appreciated.

Ultimately, a successful guestroom suite does not hinge on high-end furnishings but rather on creativity and thoughtful choices. By integrating versatile decor elements, one can achieve a stylish and inviting space without the expense often associated with hiring interior designers in Indore.

# Creating a Cozy Ambiance 

https://preview.redd.it/g2325682tv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b08d6f0e6fca8a816b55e94d88ae41dcae9dcdf

Creating a cozy ambiance in a guestroom suite is essential for ensuring that visitors feel welcome and relaxed. One effective strategy is the use of soft lighting, which can significantly alter the mood of a space. Consider incorporating table lamps with warm-toned bulbs, fairy lights, or even dimmable ceiling fixtures. These lighting options not only provide illumination but also add a gentle glow that invites guests to unwind. Natural light, where possible, can also enhance the atmosphere during the day; sheer curtains can allow sunshine to filter through softly.

Another significant component of a warm and inviting guestroom is the flooring. Adding rugs can instill warmth and comfort underfoot, making the space feel more homely. Consider selecting plush, textured rugs that complement the overall color scheme of the room while also providing a tactile experience. When selecting furnishings, prioritize comfort; plush cushions and throws can enhance the bed’s appeal and encourage relaxation.

Personal touches play a vital role in creating an intimate atmosphere. Incorporating a selection of books or magazines gives guests something to read during their stay, while plants serve as a great way to bring life and freshness into the room. Consider placing low-maintenance indoor plants, like succulents or peace lilies, on bedside tables or window sills.

Scent can dramatically influence the ambiance of a guestroom suite. Utilizing scented candles or essential oil diffusers can create pleasant aromas, contributing to relaxation. Choose calming scents like lavender or vanilla—all which can help guests unwind after a long day. Additionally, soft background music or ambient sounds can further enhance the experience, helping to create a tranquil escape. By focusing on these elements, you can successfully develop a cozy ambiance that allows guests to feel at home without excessive expenditure.

# Affordable Bedding and Linens 

https://preview.redd.it/wxxeubc3tv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8eb6a39e2dbf6e12e179688d9fb4171acbe0da59

Creating a comfortable and inviting guestroom suite on a budget requires careful selection of bedding and linens. Choosing the right materials not only ensures comfort but also enhances the overall presentation of the space. Generally, guests prioritize cleanliness and comfort, which can be achieved without resorting to high-priced alternatives.

When selecting sheets, look for options made from breathable fabrics, such as cotton or a cotton-polyester blend, as these are often more affordable yet provide a cozy feel. Thread counts between 200 and 400 are ideal for striking a balance between softness and durability. Crisp, white linens can add a touch of luxury, making them a favored choice among the[ ](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-indore/)[**best interior designers in Indore**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-indore/). Such linens are not only timeless but also easy to maintain and present a clean look.

In addition to sheets, a quality blanket or duvet is essential for guest comfort. Consider investing in lightweight, yet warm fabrics that can cater to various climates. Throw blankets made from fleece or cotton can also serve as stylish accents while providing extra layering options for your guests.

Pillows play a significant role in ensuring a restful sleep. A mix of different types, including memory foam and down alternatives, caters to various preferences, promoting a relaxing experience for your visitors. It may be beneficial to source pillows from local interior designers in Indore for better deals and options tailored to your needs.

Storage solutions should not be overlooked, as a clutter-free space contributes to comfort. Utilizing under-bed storage or decorative baskets can help manage extra linens and ensure easy access for your guests. Finally, to present the bed attractively, consider arranging the bedding neatly, adding decorative corners, and including a personalized touch like a welcome note or a small decorative element. Such details can significantly enhance the guest experience while reflecting the essence of some of the [**top 10 interior designers in Indore**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-indore/).

# Functional Amenities on a Budget 

https://preview.redd.it/e02btif4tv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6ec4cfb173e6dcff4ab18e07bad6771b82442d2

Creating a guestroom suite that exudes comfort and functionality while remaining budget-friendly is entirely feasible. By incorporating thoughtful amenities, you can significantly enhance the guest experience without straining your financial resources. One of the simplest yet impactful additions is a coffee maker. This small appliance can offer guests a touch of hospitality, allowing them to enjoy their preferred morning brew. To source an affordable coffee maker, consider visiting discount stores or exploring online marketplaces where both new and gently used options are available.

Another basic amenity that can elevate the experience is providing bottled water. To keep costs low, consider buying water bottles in bulk or refilling reusable bottles with filtered water. Guest will appreciate having convenient access to hydration, creating a hospitable atmosphere in your guestroom suite. Furthermore, toiletries are essential for any guest's stay, and buying in bulk can significantly reduce expenses. Consider sourcing travel-sized toiletries from wholesalers, which not only saves money but also ensures that you have an adequate supply ready for your guests. Alternatively, you can also curate a small DIY toiletries kit using small mason jars filled with essential products.

Moreover, charging stations can greatly enhance your guests’ comfort during their stay. Instead of investing in expensive devices, you can create a functional charging station by repurposing a small tray, featuring essential cables and adaptors. This DIY alternative can be aesthetically pleasing while serving a practical purpose. Compact power strips with USB ports can also be a cost-effective solution, ensuring that guests can charge multiple devices without clutter. In conclusion, by thoughtfully selecting and sourcing budget-friendly amenities, you can create an inviting and functional guestroom suite that your visitors will appreciate, thus mirroring the hallmark features of the best interior designers in Indore.

# Planning for Privacy and Comfort 

https://preview.redd.it/2ekmjrl5tv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1651769cf5b252559c53f5301036c18229c2277c

When designing a guestroom suite, ensuring privacy and comfort is paramount to creating a welcoming atmosphere. This is especially true for guests who may be unfamiliar with your home and seek a space that allows for relaxation and personal time. Interior designers in Indore emphasize the importance of these elements, considering them essential in both aesthetic and functional aspects of design. By incorporating thoughtful strategies, one can enhance the guest experience without substantial investment.

One effective approach is the use of curtains or drapes that can be drawn to provide visual barriers from the home's common areas, effectively creating an intimate setting within the room. Opting for heavier fabrics can also aid in soundproofing, allowing guests to enjoy their stay without disturbances from household activities. Additionally, room dividers can be utilized to create separate zones within the suite, offering an adaptable layout that caters to varying guest needs and preferences.

In some cases, considering the inclusion of a lock on the door may be beneficial. This small addition allows guests to feel more secure and comfortable, particularly if they are staying for an extended period or if the suite includes shared facilities. For those constructing a guestroom suite from scratch, a separate entrance can further enhance privacy, allowing guests to come and go at their convenience. Such features are often highlighted by the best interior designers in Indore as vital components for guest-centric spaces.

Moreover, creating a welcoming layout that respects personal space is crucial. Arrange furniture in a way that promotes easy movement and provides designated areas for sleeping, working, or lounging. By considering the comfort and privacy of guests, one can transform any room into a sophisticated and inviting suite, reflecting the high standards of [**luxury interior designers in Indore**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-indore/) while maintaining a budget-friendly approach.

# Maintaining Your Guestroom Suite 

https://preview.redd.it/ls2xb0l6tv5f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05ac19d091ccff20b06ccf58b0dda5aa5b00dcbc

Once your guestroom suite is established, it is essential to ensure that it remains an inviting and comfortable haven for visitors. Regular maintenance of the space not only preserves its aesthetics but also enhances the overall experience for guests. One of the primary aspects of upkeep involves routinely checking linens, decor, and amenities. This step is crucial in maintaining cleanliness and ensuring that everything is in good working condition, particularly since guest expectations are often high.

In terms of linens, it is advisable to wash and replace bedding and towels frequently. Opting for high-quality materials will ensure durability, making your budget stretch further. Evaluate the state of bedspreads, throws, and pillows, as these items can significantly impact the room's ambiance. Likewise, decor elements such as artwork, plants, or wall hangings should be inspected regularly for dust or damage. Repurposing or refreshing decor items can be an economical way to enhance the aesthetic without a major investment, particularly when sourced from local artisans.

Another integral aspect is the assessment of guest amenities, such as toiletries and refreshments. Establishing a small selection of essentials can provide a sense of luxury, making your suite stand out among other options, particularly when considering the top 10 interior designers in Indore for inspiration on presentation and functionality.

*Seasonal updates can also refresh the guestroom suite without incurring significant costs. For example, during the summer, light fabrics and vibrant colors can create an airy vibe, while in winter, inviting textures and warm hues can create a cozy atmosphere. By thoughtfully maintaining and occasionally renewing your guestroom suite, visitors will appreciate the attention to detail, making your space desirable in the competitive market inhabited by best interior designers in Indore.*",1,1749466191.0,interiorvibes,0,1.0,False
1l71n0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1l71n0z/dating_in_the_us_vs_latin_america_a_different/,Dating in the U.S. vs. Latin America: A Different Rhythm,"One of the biggest things that hit me after spending time in Latin America was just how different the energy around dating feels compared to the U.S.

In the States, dating often feels like it’s built around avoiding people more than meeting them. Everything’s about filtering. Screening. Making sure someone checks all the right boxes: same values, same future goals, same lifestyle, same interests. You don’t meet to connect — you meet to confirm. And behind it all is this low-level fear of “being used,” “wasting time,” or getting hurt.

That’s not how it works down here.

In Latin America, people approach dating — and life — with more flow. More ease. More joy. You go out to enjoy yourself, not to interrogate someone’s five-year plan. There’s no need to pre-screen chemistry before grabbing a coffee. If it clicks, great. If it doesn’t, you still had a good time. No hard feelings. No mental spreadsheets of red flags.

Dating in the U.S. feels like throwing darts at a bullseye — trying to hit the perfect match from the start.
Dating here feels more like a game of cards — you play the hand you’re dealt, and even a weak one can lead to a fun night, a good laugh, or an unexpected connection.

If I’d gone into things here with the same mindset I had back home, I never would’ve met my fiancée. She had what a lot of Americans might call “red flags.” But I didn’t overthink it. I let the moment breathe. And what grew from that is something incredible — something I never would’ve experienced if I’d been trying to “optimize” my love life like a startup pitch.

People in Latin America just seem more open to experience. More willing to let things unfold naturally. And that attitude shows up in every part of life. People show up late — and nobody cares. Conversations last longer. Meals stretch into hours. Plans change. Nobody freaks out. There’s a softness to it all that makes space for actual connection.

You even hear it in the music. Salsa, bachata, cumbia, reggaetón — these aren’t songs for your head, they’re for your body, your heart. Reggaetón especially — it’s raw, it’s confident, it’s sensual. It’s about moving with someone, feeling something together, even if just for a night. It’s not always about falling in love. It’s about being alive. That same rhythm pulses through dating here.

Back in the U.S., we treat dating like a business operation: reduce costs (time, effort, risk), maximize returns (the perfect partner), and automate the process through apps and filters. But somewhere along the way, we squeezed all the humanity out of it. Now it feels like a job interview with romantic overtones. Especially for men — you’re expected to perform, prove, and pursue constantly.

Here? You just show up. Be kind. Be real. Nobody needs your resume. They want your presence. Your vibe. Your attention. That’s enough.

And look — a lot of people online get judgmental when they see men dating abroad. “They’re using women,” they say. But that’s not how it feels on the ground. These women aren’t being used — they’re participating. They’re enjoying. They’re connecting. They’re not desperate to find “the one” or obsessed with vetting your entire history before sharing a drink. They’re just open. And human.

Dating here isn’t about avoiding mistakes. It’s about making memories.

And honestly? A lot of Americans don’t know what to do with that. So when they see people abroad just being happy, dating freely, living with less fear and more joy — it triggers them. They call it exploitation, or immaturity, or selfishness. But what they’re really seeing is people free from the stress and rigidity of their own culture.

We’ve built so many rules around dating in the U.S. that nobody even gets to play the game anymore. We’re so obsessed with outcomes that we forget how to enjoy the process. We ask a hundred questions before a single kiss. We worry so much about getting hurt that we never let ourselves feel anything at all.

In Latin America, dating isn’t a checklist. It’s not a strategy. It’s a vibe. A moment. A rhythm.
Sometimes it lasts. Sometimes it doesn’t. But either way, you were there. You felt something. You danced to the music.

And honestly, that might be the most important part.",29,1749466167.0,thepassportbros,17,0.84,False
1l71mmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/basketballcoach/comments/1l71mmu/three_mistakes_i_made_that_you_shouldnt/,Three Mistakes I Made That You Shouldn't,"If you are trying to work in the NBA or higher levels of basketball, then I hope you will use my stumbling blocks as your stepping stones.

In 2018, I started coaching NBA players as a shooting coach. My goal was to eventually work for an NBA team, not privately with players. Here are the three biggest mistakes I made during that journey.

# 1. Film and Share EVERYTHING:

This is the biggest thing I would do differently.

I have planned and conducted over 500 on-court sessions and thousands of film sessions with a diverse range of players, from those trying to make it in the league to All-Stars and All-NBA players. I have notebooks with every session written down, every make and miss recorded, a collection of hundreds of thousands of shots.

However, I only have a few videos[1](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/three-mistakes-i-made-that-you-shouldnt#footnote-1-153578441).

Filming was a significant pain point with people in my life. They pushed, and I refused. I should have listened.

At my core, I am a basketball purist, not a marketing guru. When I worked with a player, I formatted everything around one central thought:

The Player’s Improvement Is The First Priority.

These guys were hiring me to help them improve their game, specifically their shot. [The epicenter of each player’s game.](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-core-of-every-player-development?r=2wmouo)

Regardless of their position in the league’s hierarchy, if their shot improved significantly, it could create generational wealth for them and their families, or if they already had it, it would elevate them from an All-Star/All-NBA level to the potential MVP tier.

I took this trust seriously and placed their success as the 1st priority; I saw it as the basketball equivalent of a fiduciary duty.

My reasoning for not filming was that I needed their complete trust; I needed them to be willing to try something new, and most importantly, be willing to fail. The gym had to be a safe space, a sanctuary.

The good news: *it worked.*

The numbers speak for themselves: an average jump of 6.1% in their three-point shooting and all on career-high volume (the lowest jump for a player was 5.8%).

The bad news: *it worked out much better for the players.*

I didn't build a profile or the clout, as the kids would say.

During the Covid months, I interviewed for the position of Head of Player Development at a large agency. On the Zoom call, there were five representatives from the agency, including one agent who had put my name forward as a potential hire.

After the call, my contact called me and stated that one of the agents on the Zoom meeting claimed I was lying about working with [Malik Beasley for the past two years](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-player-development?r=2wmouo) because I had not posted about it on social media. He said there were several people in Atlanta claiming to be the person Malik had worked with for the past two years[2](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/three-mistakes-i-made-that-you-shouldnt#footnote-2-153578441).

Malik was my first NBA client and a player with whom I had planned and run over 100 on-court and 200+ film sessions. And because I didn't scream, “I’m doing this!!” on social media from the top of the mountain, that meant I wasn’t doing it in the eyes of the world.

This same agent contacted me two weeks later and requested that I work with one of his clients. Imagine that. The moral of the story: shout it from the rooftops. Put yourself first.

I redirected the time I used to spend filming and posting basketball content on social media into a focus on film, edits, and planning for players. Perhaps this *extra time* was my moment of winning on the margins—the small details that helped me create a program that consistently enabled every player to achieve a significant improvement in their shooting.

**Question:**

If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound unless it’s on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube?

**Answer:**

*No, it doesn’t.*

Please don't be as naive as I was.

# 2. Network:



Just so you know, anyone and everyone you contact will tell you to network.

This is hard to do solo, especially if you're an *“outsider”* like me. If you don’t know if you are an outsider, here are three quick “yes or no” questions you can ask yourself to find out if you are an outsider:

1. **Did you play in the NBA?**
2. **Does one of your family members currently work in the NBA?**
3. **Did one of your family members formally play or work in the NBA?**

If you can’t answer yes to any of these, then you are, in fact, an outsider.

So, here is how traditional networking is going to go for you with NBA personnel:

First, you’re going to have to scrape and claw through your contact list to play the basketball version of [six degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).

Second, if one of these contacts somehow helps you reach an individual working in the NBA[3](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/three-mistakes-i-made-that-you-shouldnt#footnote-3-153578441) by phone, email, or in person, they will undoubtedly tell you some version of this: “Build your network; your first opportunity will come through your network.”

It’s great advice, and it will be vital work if you’re going to break through. I’ve had many conversations like the one above. My biggest mistake was trying to do all the legwork myself; you’re going to need help breaking into the networking game if you're an outsider.

There are a few options:

* John Ross at [GET IN THE GAME 101](https://open.substack.com/users/16244081-get-in-the-game-101?utm_source=mentions).
* Brian Davidson at [Sports Business Journal.](https://sportsbusinessventures.com/mentor/brian-davison/)
* Brian Pauga at [Break into Basketball](https://breakintobasketball.com/).

I didn't know these resources existed when I was trying my hardest to work the networking game. If you’re an outsider, this is how to do it: pay for the introductions.

My work with Malik Beasley went well in Denver, and as a result, I was afforded some time to connect with people inside the walls. Denver’s president of basketball, Tim Connelly, set me up on a call with Wes Unseld Jr., who, at the time, was the lead assistant in Denver.

I did my best to keep things light, play the game, and turned the call into a chance to catch up over coffee whenever I was out in Denver to see Beasley.

Unseld Jr. told me:

“Your first job will come from a connection; the interview will truly be just about whether you like each other, not whether you are smart or capable as a basketball mind.”

This is one of the most true statements you’ll hear about getting a job in the NBA, or pretty much anywhere, for that matter. It’s usually already done by the time you get to the interview. Someone on the other side is in a position to put their finger on the scale for you, and it’s mainly about the vibes.

Our paths would later cross during a meeting in LA about Gary Harris, right before the COVID-19 shutdown. [If you'd like to hear more about this meeting, you can take a look at it here.](https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/follow-the-money-a-teams-payroll?r=2wmouo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false)

When Unseld Jr. got the head job with the rebuilding Washington Wizards, a place in which I had people on the inside championing my work I thought: “Holy shit! This might be how the dots connect for me to get in.” Obviously, that didn’t happen.

You never know who that person will be, but you will almost certainly not find them on your own if you’re an outsider. The three people I listed above have created businesses by connecting outsiders with insiders. If you want to gain entry as an outsider, you’ll need to compensate them for their assistance.

# 3. Be Willing To Take A Step Backward… Or Five:

It's much easier to connect the dots when going backward, and one decision stands out as the most influential inflection point in my coaching career:

*Internship with Utah or a Six-figure contract with a player.*

Although the Utah job was not guaranteed, it was an opportunity to get a resume in the door after a meeting with Bart Taylor, then the General Manager of the Salt Lake Stars. I felt I had a good shot.

I wasn't married. My expenses were low, and I could have accepted any terms they offered to get my foot in the door.

My thought process was that if I deliver great work again (another player making a 6% three-point jump) with *this* player, I would 100% be able to secure a better[4](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/three-mistakes-i-made-that-you-shouldnt#footnote-4-153578441) entry-level position than an internship.

I took the player deal. Two things happened:

1. It worked; the player saw a 6.2% increase in his three-point percentage on a career-high volume.
2. But I made the same mistakes as before. Didn’t film. Didn’t scream “I’m doing this,” and as a result, no one except a few inner circle people knew about the project.

My thought process was wrong again. If your situation allows it, you *must* take steps backward if it means a real chance to get in, but only if working in the league is what you want and not just something you say.

Over the next few years, a similar story began to play out in numerous conversations with team personnel:

**Them:** *Tell us how you do it.*

**Me:** *I would love to! Players X, Y, and Z in your program possess all the physical tools necessary to thrive in the program I run, which has contributed to the improvements of Players A, B, and C. Do you see me in a potential role in your organization?*

**Them:** *Oh, and by the way, there are no job openings available for you here. We just want to know how you improve players’ shooting.*

I had some of the weirdest requests during this time. One assistant general manager asked me to take his analytics staff through my hard drive and teach them the body positions and movements that form the foundation of my “Stacking” program so they could incorporate it into their models: no fee, no job, nothing. Do it because we are an NBA team[5](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/three-mistakes-i-made-that-you-shouldnt#footnote-5-153578441).

One high-profile general manager asked me to send him a project on the bad habits and how to change them in one of their players’ shots, so that they could pass it on to the coaching staff to use: no fee, no job, nothing. Do it because we are an NBA team.

During my years with Malik, we would work out at Pepperdine; it’s one of my favorite gyms in the entire world. A small, single-court gym up on a hill, overlooking the water, there’s not many better feelings than looking out and taking in the Pacific Ocean at the top of those stairs before or after a workout.

[Mike Wexler ](https://www.nba.com/lakers/team/roster-coaches)(Lakers) and [Connor Griffin](https://www.nba.com/nets/roster) (Brooklyn) were at Pepperdine during this time and attended almost every workout, regardless of whether it was at 5 a.m. or 10 p.m. A few years later, they both made the climb into the league, and I couldn’t be more proud of what they’re doing right now. One of my favorite memories from my seven years of working with NBA players didn’t involve a player, but rather when Connor was in the final stages of interviews with the Denver Nuggets, and they called me as a reference. Talking about all the positive things Connor would bring to Denver and how lucky I was to have him in the gym gave me the greatest joy. I’m positive he would have gotten the job without that conversation, but it added to the pleasure of seeing him and Mike get “in,” which meant the world to me.

To all the young coaches reading this, know that it’s not impossible. Mike and Connor are two great examples, and I hope my stumbling blocks can serve as stepping stones for you along your journey.

Good luck!

So I've lived in Berlin for a few years now, and something that always struck me was how easy it is to feel disconnected in such a big, busy, wild city. I’ve used Facebook, Bumble BFF, Meetup... all had their moments, but nothing ever really stuck long-term.

That’s why I recently created a small Reddit space called **r/berlin_intimate** – just a simple place for Berliners to find real, in-person connection. No algorithms, no pressure – just people posting things like “Hey, want to grab a coffee this weekend?” or “Looking for a walk buddy in Kreuzberg”.

Still super new, but figured I’d share it here in case it resonates with anyone else.

Would love for it to become a chill, respectful space for spontaneous (or meaningful) meetups of all kinds – friends, walks, dates, whatever you’re into.

Thanks for reading – and keep this subreddit awesome! 🙌",0,1749466088.0,berlinsocialclub,38,0.4,False
1l71lwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cristostone21/comments/1l71lwj/resistant_vs_resistant_quartz_in_the_postcovid/,Resistant vs. Resistant: Quartz in the Post-COVID Kitchen,"I[f there’s one place in our homes that became the true MVP during the pandemic, it’s the kitchen. Whether it was baking banana bread in 2020, setting up a makeshift home office at the island, or turning to comfort food during uncertain times — the kitchen wasn’t just where we cooked. It became where we lived.](https://cristostone.com/)

Now, even as life has moved forward, that shift hasn't gone away. People want kitchens that work *hard*, stay *clean*, and look *beautiful*. And that’s where **quartz** comes in — ticking all the boxes of what we now expect from our surfaces.

# Resistant to Stains, Scratches & Heat

Let’s get straight to the point: quartz is a workhorse. It's engineered to be non-porous, which means no stains from turmeric, wine, or coffee — three things that have ruined plenty of countertops in Indian homes.

And with 2020’s obsession with cleaning everything, the fact that quartz doesn’t need sealing and resists bacteria became a major win. Even today, those hygiene habits have stuck around. People still want to wipe and go, without worrying about deep cleaning or harboring germs in porous surfaces.

Plus, thanks to its high heat resistance, you can set down a hot pot *occasionally* without panic — though, let’s be honest, using a trivet is still a smart move.

# Resistant to Fading Trends

Here’s the other kind of resistance: *style*. Quartz has staying power. The patterns and finishes we’re seeing in 2025 — from soft marbles to bold veined statements — aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

Post-COVID, people have moved toward *intentional design*. That means choosing materials that last both in quality and in looks. A quartz countertop doesn’t scream for attention, but it quietly elevates the entire space — whether your vibe is sleek modern or warm traditional.

# Quartz in the New Normal Kitchen

The kitchen of today needs to be:

* Durable ✔️
* Easy to clean ✔️
* Low maintenance ✔️
* Gorgeous (because Zoom calls still happen here!) ✔️

Quartz fits right in. It’s not just a safe bet; it’s a smart one. And whether you’re building new or remodeling, this material has proven it can stand the test of time — and pandemics.

# Ready to Upgrade?

Visit one of our **CristoStone showrooms** in Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, or Mumbai to experience our premium quartz collections in person. And if you’re still not sure what design suits you best? Our experts are happy to help you find “the one.”",1,1749466056.0,u_cristostone21,0,1.0,False

But I am a little worried my machine might explode, because the one thing all my tweaking never solved is the pressure.

No matter the amount of coffee, 16-19g, no matter how coarse or fine the grind, no matter how light or heavy the tamp, the pressure is sky high. The needle moves a little during pre-infusion, then rockets up, way past what the gauge indicates as ""Espresso Range.""

It’s there so I feel like I need to buy it. I have made iced coffee at home and try to replicate a similar coffee type at home but it’s time consuming and I didn’t like my coffee at home as much as I like buying a frappe instead. 

I don’t need coffee I would say. I live without it just fine on the weekends. When I was a stay at home mom I barely drank coffee. I feel like passing the coffee shop everyday is what’s making me buy it and if I try to avoid it I end up going there anyways just at a different time of the day.

**Ava’s POV**

The room froze when I saw him kiss her. One second I was hidden in the shadows, and the next my claws were digging into my palms, blood dripping onto the marble floor.

*Control, Ava. You can’t shift here.*

I stood in the darkest corner of Moonlight Lodge’s ballroom. My champagne tasted like cardboard. Shadow Creek pack was still a mess after our Alpha’s death last month. Not the time or place for me to lose control.

Jackson and Sophia swayed on the dance floor. My ex-fated mate couldn’t keep his hands off the Silverpeak princess. When she laughed at whatever he whispered, pain shot through my mark.

My neck burned where he’d marked me. Four months ago, he swore we were meant to be. Now he’s chasing power instead of love. His plan was simple: marry the Alpha King’s daughter, become Shadow Creek’s next Alpha. Easy upgrade from dating a nobody like me.

My fangs were already pressing against my lower lip. No amount of breathing exercises would stop this shift if I stayed watching them another minute.

I set down my champagne and made a beeline for the bar. Maybe alcohol could drown the rage before I fully transformed in a room full of elites who’d eat me alive for the entertainment value.

“Double whiskey,” I growled, not bothering to hide the gravel in my voice. The bartender’s eyes widened at what must have been the yellow glow of my irises.

“Make that a Moonlight Martini for the lady,” a deep voice cut in. “And the whiskey for me.”

My wolf froze mid-snarl. Just… stopped. Like someone had hit pause on her fury.

I turned and looked up—way up—into eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea. They weren’t just looking at me; they were seeing through me.

He wasn’t pretty-boy handsome like Jackson. This man’s face had character—laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, a slight crease between his brows from frowning too much. Dark hair with silver at the temples. His suit fit him like a second skin, but couldn’t hide the raw power underneath.

But his scent—*fuck*. Rain-soaked pine trees, woodsmoke, and something wild that made my wolf sit up and beg. The complete opposite to Jackson’s cologne-masked scent that never made my wolf react like this.

“I didn’t ask for your input,” I said, trying to sound tough while my wolf was practically rolling over.

One corner of his mouth kicked up. “You’re about thirty seconds from shifting in a roomful of pack leaders. The drink has wolfsbane extract. It’ll help.”

I glanced down at my hands. Claws, not fingernails.

“Whatever,” I muttered.

The bartender slid over the martini—swirling silver-blue like moonlight on water.

The stranger leaned closer. “Drink up. Your eyes are giving you away.”

I knocked it back in one go, grimacing at the bitter aftertaste.

“Better?” he asked, voice so deep I felt it in my chest.

The effect was almost immediate. My wolf settled, claws retracting, teeth returning to normal.

“Thanks,” I said reluctantly. “Though I’m not sure why you give a damn if I make a scene.”

His eyes flicked to the dance floor, then back to me with unexpected heat. “Let’s just say I have a soft spot for underdogs.”

Before I could respond, people started moving aside, stepping back to clear a path. For him. The penny dropped.

“You’re Blake Morgan,” I said, my stomach doing a backflip. “The Silverpeak Alpha.”

*The Alpha King. The one who could destroy every Alpha in the world with a single command.*

My wolf cowered and preened at the same time, a confusing mix.

“And you’re wearing a mate mark that’s being rejected.” His gaze dropped to my neck where the silver-white mark throbbed. “Who did that to you?”

The question hung between us. Telling the Alpha King that his future son-in-law had marked and abandoned me seemed like a bad idea.

“Someone who decided power was more attractive than keeping his word,” I said instead.

His eyes narrowed slightly. “Your control is slipping again. Come with me.”

It wasn’t a suggestion. The words carried the weight of Alpha command, pressing against my will. My wolf, weirdly, didn’t mind.

He guided me toward a private elevator, not touching me but close enough that his body heat reached across the inches between us. My skin prickled like I’d stuck my finger in an outlet.

The top floor suite was bigger than my entire house. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the forest and mountains beyond, silver moonlight pouring across dark furniture.

He went to a cabinet, returning with a glass of water and some dried herbs.

“Chew these,” he instructed.

I raised an eyebrow. “You always carry herbs for random werewolves having meltdowns?”

“Only the interesting ones.” Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. “The mark on your neck—it’s making you lose control, isn’t it?”

I touched it reflexively, wincing. “They never covered ‘what to do when your fated mate dumps you’ in werewolf school.”

“It’s strange to see a marked wolf without their mate present.” His voice dropped lower. “Especially at an event where that mate might be.”

The gears turned behind his eyes. He was connecting the dots—my reaction downstairs, the mark, his daughter’s fiancé.

“It’s Jackson, isn’t it?” he asked quietly. “My daughter’s fiancé marked you.”

I couldn’t speak, but my silence said it all.

“When?”

“Four months ago,” I said, tasting the bitterness. “Right before he decided being the next Shadow Creek Alpha was worth more than honoring a fated mate bond.”

Blake’s jaw tightened, the only sign that my words hit home. “And he never tried to break the mark properly?”

“Apparently dumping me in a coffee shop with ‘it’s not personal, it’s politics’ counts as closure in his book.”

Blake moved closer, his scent wrapping around me like a warm blanket. My wolf, who should have been cowering before the most powerful Alpha in our world, was instead practically purring.

“May I?” His fingers hovered near my neck, not quite touching the mark.

I should have said no. This was Sophia’s father. Jackson’s future father-in-law. But my wolf pressed forward, tilting my head to expose the mark.

When his fingertips brushed my skin, lightning shot through me. His eyes darkened, pupils expanding.

Something flashed in his expression—surprise, confusion, then interest.

Instead of pulling away, he traced the outline of the mark. Heat bloomed from his touch, not the burning pain I’d gotten used to, but something warm and sweet that pooled low in my belly.

I couldn’t deny it. My wolf was straining toward him like he was the last steak on earth.

“Why?” I whispered.

*Why am I reacting to my ex’s future father-in-law?*

He shook his head slowly, still touching my neck. “I don’t know what this is. But I want to find out.”

The pull between us grew stronger with each heartbeat. When he finally leaned down, it felt inevitable—his mouth meeting mine with a hunger that matched my own. My hands grabbed his shirt, dragging him closer. His arms wrapped around me, lifting me effortlessly against him.

It was crazy. Completely nuts. He was the father of the woman who’d stolen my mate. The most powerful werewolf alive. And I was nobody—just a Delta’s adopted daughter with a worthless mate mark.

My wolf didn’t care. She recognized something in him that cut through all that human BS.

Just as his hands slid lower, a voice sliced through my mind:

*Ava… they took your father…*

I gasped, color draining from my face. My mother’s voice, shaky and terrified, crashed through our mindlink with an urgency that chilled my blood.",1,1749465422.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

# 3 Micro-Workflows Worth Your Coffee Break

|Pain it Solves|What You Do|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Copy A/B fatigue**|Break the prompt into micro-tasks: headline → body → CTA — and test each slice separately in ChatGPT.| **Content-Creation** Keeps variables clean and hits the primitive that OpenAI says drives the fastest wins for marketers.|
|**Brand-tone drift**|Paste a 1-paragraph “voice sample” from your best campaign into every prompt. Let GPT mimic it automatically.|The guide shows AI “writes in your company’s style” when you feed it in-context examples.|
|**Blank-page ideation**|Drag raw focus-group notes (or screenshots) into ChatGPT and ask for headline angles before you brainstorm.|Uploading docs unlocks instant research insight; Match Group even simulates focus groups this way.|

# Why You Should Care

* **Saves real hours:** Promega shaved **135 hours** off email production in six months just by letting GPT draft first versions.
* **Keeps momentum high:** All three hacks land in the **high-impact / low-effort** quadrant that OpenAI recommends starting with, so you get quick wins without red tape.
* **Scales with your stack:** Each trick maps to one of the six core primitives (content, research, automation) that OpenAI says will future-proof your workflow.

**Next Steps (15-Minute Sprint)**

1. **Pick one live campaign.** Slice the brief into the three prompt chunks above.
2. **Drop your best-performing paragraph** into ChatGPT as a tone reference; generate 5 variant headlines.
3. **Upload last quarter’s survey notes** and ask: “What fresh angles did we miss?”
4. **Ship an A/B test** by EOD and tag results source=GPT in your CMS so you can track lift later.

**What’s your perspective on these AI workflows?** Jump into the comments to debate, ask questions, or share your own tips. Let’s spark a real conversation!

If you're searching for a **resort in Wayanad with a private infinity pool**, [**Wayanad Silverwoods**](https://wayanadsilverwoods.com/) is 100% worth checking out.

💧 **Why We Loved It**  
We stayed in one of their **Lakeview Villas** that came with a **private infinity pool**. Imagine taking a dip with your partner while watching the mist roll over Banasura Sagar Lake. Unreal. The villa was super spacious with warm lighting, rain showers, and even a jacuzzi in the bathroom!

🍽️ They arranged a **candlelight dinner** beside the pool one night, which was such a vibe. Plus, they offer Ayurvedic couple spa sessions and nature walks  super peaceful and intimate stuff.

🌿 The resort is surrounded by hills, forest, and water  if you love nature and calm vibes, this is it. We also did boating, short cycling trails, and even tried their coffee from the lakeside café.

🧘‍♀️ Pro tip: Book one of their **couple packages**. They include spa treatments, floral room setups, and other cute perks. Totally worth it.

📌 **What You Should Know**

* Yes, the infinity pools are private and cleaned daily
* It’s an eco-friendly resort
* Super courteous staff, but your privacy is always respected
* Great food (try the Kerala-style fish curry!)
* It’s about 30-40 min from Kalpetta town

📷 DM me if you want pics or villa recommendations – happy to share more!

I do miss the home page headbanner with highlights. I do like the full banner display of the series. Also, not sure if this is new or if i just didn’t notice, the recently viewed tab is a nice function. I also noticed they changed genres to categories. They didn't change anything about the reading experience.

They used to have a problem with sorting on dates, but now it works fine.

Does anyone else read on browser version? What do you prefer?

But that isn't how I work. If I have a complex problem, I need to know HOW to solve it. If I need to improvise every step and follow arbitrary rules then that is far too confusing and I'll be overwhelmed.

Every step of 'dating' is unclear. The first problem is where to meet someone. What places are acceptable and what places aren't? Are coffee shops and gyms acceptable places to initiate this contact, or should I just leave women alone in these circumstances? If it's situational then what defines an acceptable situation to ask someone out? 

If I have the green light to go ahead, what do I say? Should I lead with a compliment or just establish a conversation. How do I tell if she is just being polite or is actually interested? How do I find out if she has a boyfriend but not make it uncomfortable?

I need assistance with almost every single step. It's so confusing and seems impossible and it's just assumed that everyone knows how to do it. ",4,1749464626.0,ForeverAlone,1,0.84,False
