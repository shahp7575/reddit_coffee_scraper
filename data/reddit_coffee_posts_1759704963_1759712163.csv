1nz58q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nz58q2/aio_i_lied_to_my_manager_to_get_out_of_work/,AIO I lied to my manager to get out of work,"To start this off, I work 2 jobs. A coffee shop and a salon. I work 5 days at the salon from 9-8 and the coffee shop job for 6 hours (I get different shifts every time). 

I am feeling a bit burnt out being at the coffee shop but I have so many friends there that I like very much. But I will never give up my salon job because that's what I want to do career wise. I've been at this salon job for 2 weeks and they are putting me to work. 

Which I don't mind because this is a job I want to take seriously. The coffee shop...not so much. It's just a skipping stone job to keep me afloat while I earn more income for me and my grandma.

I found out my grandma is getting heart surgery soon and it made my anxiety pretty bad. Im feeling tired, overwhelmed, overworked, and not appreciated much at the coffee shop. Not to mention that the drama is kinda bad.

Anyways, one day I just had a breakdown and I wanted a day to just reset, clean my room, do my laundry and spend time with my family (who I haven't seen in a bit). I texted my managers saying my grandma was going into heart surgery tomorrow. Which is a lie. Something I don't do very often because I was taught that it will always come back to bite me. 

They texted me saying that it was fine and that they wish my grandma the best and sent their prayers. This is when I started feeling so effing guilty. I just want to confess and tell them the real story. 

FORGOT TO MENTION: I met up with my coworker that day that knew I was lying (she is someone who is very close to me so I knew I could trust her) She told me I was overreacting and that it's good I feel guilty so I know not to do it again but that it's no one's business. She worked later that day so I came with to get a drink and LEAVE. 

This is where I effed up. I came in and played the part of me acting down. My other coworker came up to me and asked if I wanted to take the rest of her shift. I really didn't want to but the others begged me. So I did. I worked for maybe 2 hours and left.

When I got home I got a text message from my manager who was really nice about it but I could tell she was having a hard time trusting me. To which I lied again. I am not lying about my grandma needing surgery but I did lie about what day it was because I just needed a break.

I am literally having a panic attack. I want to say something to my manager who texted me but Im afraid she is going to tell my head manager. Please tell me if I should confess or keep it to myself and learn from this mistake. ",1,1759711831.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1nz55xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1nz55xc/ib_gard_and_digestive_enzymes_finally_cured_me/,IB Gard and Digestive Enzymes finally cured me,"I just had my first mango mojito in four months last night with beef empanadas for dinner and had no pain at all today. After starting a regime of taking IB Gard on the am and pm for two months alongside digestive enzymes I am around 90% cured. I won't say it's the only thing that has helped, but I‚Äôve slowly reintroduced different foods into my diet after following a strict anti inflammatory gastritis diet for three months. 

I was suffering symptoms of indigestion, bloating, abdominal pain, cramping, acid reflux, intestines and stomach line burning for the past four months. After starting inner aloe Vera juice, DGL licorice, and Slippery elm capsules my symptoms eased but were still prevalent and became something similar to IBS. After my doctor recommended me to try FD Gard and IB Gard I started a regiment of IB Gard for the past two months. And it worked!! But the real game changer was taking IB Gard and digestive enzymes for my meals. 

I doubt this is a cure-all for everyone, but I had been taking turmeric, probiotics, and tried other things recommended on this sub. Anyway, I started taking IB Gard before eating breakfast in the mornings and dinner at night and have successfully been able to now eat fish and carnitas tacos, sub sandwiches, pizza, baked ziti, and chinese takeout food with no issue. I‚Äôve now eaten at Chick fil a, Jersey mikes, Taco Bell, takeout cheese pizza, several Chinese takeout spots, and several mexican spots with no issues. Also I can eat spicy sushi and spicy kbbq again in moderation. I even had halal food the other day with no problem.

Of course, I am still being careful - no high coffee, no citrus, nothing obviously acidic. But I can drink matcha and decaf. I am still meal prepping with chicken and turkey meatballs with stir fry veggies during my work weeks. But I feel like I'm getting back to fully normal, finally. 

For those of you that feel like results aren‚Äôt coming after starting a strict regime for 3-4 weeks please don‚Äôt feel discouraged. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing because all of our bodies heal at different paces. It will get better. Slow and steady wins the race!",1,1759711608.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1nz53gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nz53gw/i_30m_was_accused_of_being_inappropriate_by/,"I [30M] was accused of being inappropriate by someone [26F] I used to manage, and thought was my friend.","This is probably going to be a long story, tldr at the bottom but it‚Äôs been eating away at me and yesterday I received the nastiest message of my life.

So to begin, I initially hired this person and I was their manager for two years. Over that time we became pretty close, and had what I would describe as a genuine friendship, where we would send texts, reels/memes & chat about our lives. We also had a strong working relationship and she was great at her job which made my life so easy.

Coming from a position of power, I was always very conscious about what I said, making sure to never say anything that could be misinterpreted as anything more than friendly.

My personal life at the time is somewhat relevant here too as part of a work trip, I took my now fianc√© overseas and proposed. It is something that was widely known about in the organisation and something that I shared openly and proudly.

However over time as we grew closer, the organisation I worked for had a restructure where Sarah (not real name) was no longer reporting to me.

Despite my frustration with the organisational change, Sarah and I continued to have 1:1s and keep in touch daily. This went on for about 6 months until I ultimately decided to leave the organisation due to frustration and lack of growth opportunities.

When I left, I had conversations with Sarah mutually saying that we would stay in touch and I even proposed catching up after work or for coffee once a month or so. Also, in a card I received from the wider team during my exit, she wrote ‚ÄúI know we will stay friends!!!‚Äù

Now here is the situation.

Starting a new job is hard. It‚Äôs lonely, and I was struggling to make new friends. So I did what I have been doing for the few years. I leant on my friends, including Sarah.

I continued to send memes, I complained about being the new person and particularity the differences in work processes between the two organisations. After maybe 3 weeks of my new job, I decided to reach out about catching up for a drink by saying that one of the bars we had been to for team drinks was about half way between both of our offices. She reacted to that message at the time with the blush emoji and then started to slow down on her replies. Feeling like I have overstepped, I decided to be straightforward and ask whether that made her uncomfortable? It wasn‚Äôt my intention at all, I just wanted to catch up on all the drama from my old workplace and have a vent about being the new guy again.

After a few days she replied saying she was busy but it didn‚Äôt make her uncomfortable and that there is nothing to worry about. I took that at face value.

So I continued to behave somewhat normally but with this lingering feeling that something was wrong. I sent a few memes and messages and photos over the next few weeks, some she responded to, but most she didn‚Äôt. A real difference to how we usually spoke, at least from my perspective.

So after a while, maybe another week or so, I decided to ask again. For better or worse, I am a straightforward kind of person who would rather know, whatever the reason. But again, no response. I honestly began to get concerned, I wondered if she was not okay, had I done something wrong, or if she really was just busy.

This is where I probably messed up but it was eating away at me. I probably sent maybe 6-8 messages over the next two to three weeks checking in. I said how I was genuinely concerned, I asked whether something was wrong or I had offended her in anyway and apologised for whatever it could be.

Over the weekend after a few beers, I decided once again, to send a message, and even called once. I felt like a crazy person and I was well aware that I had probably sent too many messages and even said so within the message but I didn‚Äôt want to just let the friendship go over a situation I didn‚Äôt understand.

The next morning, after maybe a month of silence, I finally got a response. I‚Äôm actually grateful to have a response as I can finally stop worrying but it honestly was extremely nasty and I guess I‚Äôm wondering if I deserved it.

It said, not verbatim:

‚ÄúWho do I think I am calling after I didn‚Äôt respond to a message? When I told you nothing was wrong I meant it.

The way you have been with me recently is extremely inappropriate. To someone who was my manager, it is extremely inappropriate to ask to hang out a month after leaving. And expect me to respond to you within a day or something is wrong.

You have been acting so clingy and obsessive it has made me extremely uncomfortable. After you left the organisation you should have expected that our friendship would not remain the same.

It‚Äôs also important to remember that just because you‚Äôre blunt, doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone else is comfortable with that. I have been too busy with my life recently that I have not had the time or energy to deal with this situation.

Whether you like it or not, you were my manager and that power dynamic will always be there for me. You need to realise that the relationship we had at work wasn‚Äôt going to survive one of us leaving and your behaviour has been extremely inappropriate and made me unsure whether I can continue contact, at least for the foreseeable future.‚Äù

Back to me now:

I was quite shocked to read that. I did expect to some degree that I had sent too many messages, I did feel like a crazy person worrying. But after communicating almost every day for three years I thought it was really out of character and I was genuinely concerned about her. I feel like that message really attacks my character and portrays me as some creep, which is something I actively have been extremely careful to avoid in all messages over the last three years.

I guess I‚Äôm at a loss. I realise the friendship is over, I won‚Äôt be contacting her again but and I‚Äôm left questioning whether it was just one sided this whole time and I was oblivious.

Was it foolish to think we could be friends?

TL;DR, I thought an ex colleague who I used to manage and I were friends. Discussed that we would catch up after I resigned, tried to stay in contact, and I asked to catch up. I sent too many messages after being ghosted. But then I was accused of being inappropriate which I feel is really unfair. ",0,1759711415.0,relationships,4,0.5,False

The energy felt thick... too still... like multiple pairs of eyes followed me.

I work security - one man, one flashlight, one cracked thermos of coffee. Typical night shift survival kit. The place had been abandoned for years before some company bought it for storage. I'm not sure what they store, only that every box is sealed too neatly and stacked professionally. Feels like a front.

The first week was quiet. Cameras static, floors creaked, rats scratched inside the walls. Normal things. I'd whisper to myself just to break the silence. Sometimes I'd pop in some earbuds to change the atmosphere. Most times I would sleep or play on my phone.

It started with the windows of the office.

Windows line the hall outside the office - warped glass, silver faded to a dull gray. The kind you avoid looking into too long because it looks back. I'd catch glimpses when I passed... a womanly shape behind my shoulder... the faint glimpse of hair swaying when there was no logical explanation for any air flow in this building.

She never appeared fully. Just in reflections - glass, metal, water that pooled in the sink when I washed my hands. Every time I looked too fast, she was gone... every time I didn't, she was closer.

By the third week, I started talking to her. ""You just passing through?"" I'd ask the empty building between aisles of boxes. ""Or are you working the night shift too?""
My voice never sounded right anymore.

On the monitor screens, sometimes I saw movement - the shape of someone standing where no one should've been, facing the wall.
When I went to check, there was nothing but my own breathing and paranoia... and behind me, captured by the security footage. The woman. Pale. Watching. Waiting.

I started covering reflective surfaces - cardboard in front of glass, duct tape over metal, anything to stop the reflection. But you can't cover everything. Not the coffee in my cup, not the dark shine in my eyes when the light hit just right.

At 3:17 a.m., I caught her smiling at me from the black of a turned-off monitor. Her lips didn't move, but I heard her voice anyway - soft, patient, close.

""You work nights too, darling?""

I smashed the monitor with my flashlight. It didn't help. The cracked glass still showed her face - each shard holding a piece of her, like she'd multiplied.

By morning, the warehouse was quiet again. The boxes still stood like witnesses to my night.
They found my flashlight on the floor near the office...
and the security monitor flickering static.

Through the dark, you could almost see her silhouette, bending over my corpse - whispering something into ears that can't hear anymore.",1,1759711379.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1nz52zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/iTunesMatch/comments/1nz52zl/cloudy_with_a_chance_of_missing_features_the/,Cloudy With a Chance of Missing Features: The iTunes Match Saga,"Ah, iTunes Match. The cloud-based but emotionally unavailable partner to your sprawling music library. For those of us who‚Äôve spent years ripping CDs, tagging tracks, and hoarding obscure bootlegs like they were rare Pok√©mon cards, iTunes Match was supposed to be the dream: scan your library, match your songs to Apple‚Äôs pristine cloud versions, and stream your collection from anywhere.

But somewhere between the promise and the playback, a few key features got lost in the shuffle. Here‚Äôs a lovingly sarcastic roundup of the most commonly requested‚Äîbut still MIA‚Äîfeatures that Apple has yet to implement, despite our cries echoing through support forums since 2011.

# üñºÔ∏è 1. Force Metadata & Artwork Update from Matched Tracks

You matched your track to Apple‚Äôs version. Great! But your metadata still says ‚ÄúTrack 01‚Äù and the artwork is a pixelated photo of a cassette tape. Why, Apple, why? Users have long begged for a ‚Äúforce update‚Äù option that pulls in the clean metadata and high-res artwork from Apple‚Äôs matched version. Instead, we‚Äôre left manually editing fields like it‚Äôs 2005 and we‚Äôre burning mix CDs for our crush.

# üö´ 2. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Upload Unmatched Tracks‚Äù Toggle

Sometimes you just don‚Äôt want your unmatched tracks uploaded to the cloud. Maybe they‚Äôre low-quality demos, maybe they‚Äôre embarrassing teenage garage band recordings, or maybe they‚Äôre just too precious to risk Apple‚Äôs metadata blender. Users have begged for a simple checkbox: ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt match, leave it alone.‚Äù But Apple‚Äôs stance? ‚ÄúWe know better.‚Äù So your rare 96kbps live recording from a 2003 ska festival? Uploaded. Forever. You're welcome.

# üß† 3. Smart Playlist Syncing

You can sync your music. You can sync your metadata. But your smart playlists? Those clever little auto-updating gems‚Äî‚ÄúSongs I Haven‚Äôt Played Since the Bush Administration‚Äù‚Äîare stuck on your local machine like it‚Äôs still 2008. Apple, we‚Äôre not asking for miracles. Just let our smart playlists be smart everywhere.

# üìÄ 4. Match Quality Override

Sometimes iTunes Match replaces your lovingly ripped FLAC-to-ALAC version of a rare Japanese import with a 256kbps version from a karaoke compilation. It‚Äôs like trading a first edition for a paperback with coffee stains. Users have long requested a ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Replace My Superior Audio‚Äù option. Apple‚Äôs response? *Shrug emoji.*

# üß¨ 5. Version Control (Live vs Studio vs Remix)

You matched ‚ÄúHotel California.‚Äù Great. But is it the live version from 1980? The studio cut from 1976? Or the acoustic version from that one Eagles reunion? iTunes Match doesn‚Äôt know, and frankly, it doesn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs like a blind date with your music‚Äîsurprise! It‚Äôs the version you didn‚Äôt want.

# üßπ 6. Cleaner Cloud Library Management

Managing your cloud library feels like trying to alphabetize soup. You can‚Äôt sort by match status, you can‚Äôt filter by upload quality, and you definitely can‚Äôt bulk-edit anything. It‚Äôs like Apple wants you to give up and just stream Apple Music instead.

# üóÇÔ∏è 7. Folder-Based Matching

For those of us who organize our music like librarians‚Äîfolders by genre, year, mood, lunar phase‚ÄîiTunes Match doesn‚Äôt care. It scans your library like a toddler rifling through a toy bin. A folder-based matching option would be a dream for archivists who don‚Äôt want their Gregorian chants mixed in with EDM remixes.

# üßû 8. Bulk Unmatch or Re-Match

Want to undo a bad match? You‚Äôll need to manually delete the track, re-upload it, and pray to the iCloud gods. A bulk ‚ÄúUnmatch‚Äù or ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù button would save hours‚Äîand possibly friendships.

# üß† 9. Better Duplicate Detection

iTunes Match has the memory of a goldfish when it comes to duplicates. You might end up with three versions of ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody,‚Äù each from a different compilation, and iTunes Match will proudly upload all three like it‚Äôs curating a Queen museum. A little logic, Apple? Maybe a ‚Äúmerge identical tracks‚Äù button?

# üßº 10. Metadata Preservation

You spent years tagging your tracks with custom genres like ‚ÄúSad Robot Jazz‚Äù and ‚ÄúPost-Apocalyptic Disco.‚Äù iTunes Match sees your creativity and says, ‚ÄúNah, let‚Äôs call this Pop.‚Äù The metadata wipe is real, and it hurts. Give us a checkbox, Apple: ‚ÄúPreserve My Weird Tags.‚Äù

# üïµÔ∏è 11. Transparency in Matching Decisions

Why did it match your pristine rip of ‚ÄúPurple Rain‚Äù to a karaoke version from a budget compilation? Nobody knows. Apple‚Äôs matching algorithm is more secretive than the Colonel‚Äôs chicken recipe. A simple ‚ÄúWhy I Matched This‚Äù tooltip would go a long way toward soothing our confused souls.

**Final Thoughts:** iTunes Match is like that friend who shows up late to your party, brings the wrong chips, but still somehow makes you nostalgic for the good old days. We love it. We hate it. We wish Apple would give it a little TLC‚Äîor at least read the forums once in a while.

Until then, we‚Äôll keep dreaming of a world where our unmatched tracks stay private, our playlists sync across space and time, and our FLAC files fly free‚Äîwith artwork that doesn‚Äôt look like it was scanned from a cereal box.

Nate, my colleague, was fucking weird. He started as a friend, but somewhere along the line, he became obsessed with Zac, another colleague, and with me, when the three of us started working on a game together. His files were full of unfinished sketches of the two of us.

When Jude, our new animator, arrived, his blunt, no-nonsense attitude had finally driven Nate away. 

Now he was outside my apartment at 3am. 

At work the next day, Jude relentlessly bullied him as payback. Penn dumped his laptop in the trash, and I stole his wallet. 

‚ÄúHey, Nate!‚Äù Jude shouted across the studio. 

His latest joke was over the top coffee orders.

‚ÄúI'll have a double-grande latte with sprinkles, whipped cream, aaaand fudge sauce!‚Äù

Nate texted while we were having dinner. He wanted to talk at his place about the game. Cloudtown was almost finished. 

We just needed characters.

‚ÄúFuck him,‚Äù Jude groaned, downing his beer. ‚ÄúHe could, like, murder us and immortalize us in his freaky art.‚Äù

Zac laughed, nudging him. ‚ÄúYou watch waaay too many crime shows.‚Äù

We still visited, dragging along a reluctant Jude. 

The door slammed shut behind us the moment we stepped in, and it made me jump. Zac‚Äôs sharp gasp followed, then Jude‚Äôs muffled scream. Cold hands clamped over my mouth, stifling my cry, dragging me into the shadows toward that eerie, pulsing green light. It‚Ä¶ kind of reminded me of a Sim plumbob.

I woke up twice. 

The first time, I was on my back,  green light stretching across my vision. Cold porcelain held me. 

I was in a bathtub. 

To my right, a slumped figure was illuminated in that plumbob green. 

Zac. 

Threaded with wires snaking through his ears and nose, his head was no longer recognizably human.

A raw cry crawled up my throat, but I was so tired, my eyes flickering. I was half aware my right arm was gone. 

So was my leg.

Wet warmth seeped underneath me, sticky  and wrong. 

Another body was squished up against me. Jude. 

In the darkness, his torso lay, his lanyard still looped around his neck. 

But where‚Ä¶ 

Where was Jude‚Äôs‚Ä¶ 

That endless green light brightened, suddenly.

I blinked. 

I was standing in a coffee store. 

In front of me, dressed in an apron,  mid eye-roll, was Jude. 

‚ÄúYour coffee,‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúJude?‚Äù I whispered. 

I couldn't stop myself, prodding his cheek, where I'd colored the soft gradient browns of the NPC‚Äôs apron and hair. 

Jude stared straight through me.

‚ÄúEnjoy your drink!‚Äù

I stumbled back. 

I drew all of this. 

The NPC‚Äôs. 

The cozy colored sky above. 

I was inside *Cloudtown*.

**‚ÄúHey, Penny!‚Äù**

I turned around, facing our unnamed protagonist. 

His face was an outline with no discernible features.

1nz4vto,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nz4vto/sp_5_stories/,[SP] 5 Stories,"## Short Story 1: The Desert Office

There was an office in the middle of the desert, workers came every day somehow they found a way, every week a worker lost his way you could say they went astray. How this happens I cannot say. But the sun‚Äôs ray can make your mind a filet. On one particular day when a worker went stray, they found their way to another place, to a temple made from hay. In front in the sand stuck a blade. However to get there through a moat he must wade. He swam on through and walked on up, to find the blade, however it was stuck so deep so deep so great. In front laid a spade which he used to dig up the blade. On the blade were strange symbols that made his mind degrade. Soon the sun would set, the light would fade. In the sand behind the moat he dug a bed so soft he felt he could float, next to his arm laid the blade, its symbols an eerie light in the dark night. As he looked to the heavens above he thought the moon and the clouds would soon have fought but instead was not right, for they drifted in the direction of another light. The darkness so great his eyelids so weak, he fell in to a dream filled sleep. A mother would weep as she lost her sheep, they caught a stray chasing a temple of hay, instead the wolves would come and kill, the sheep for how unknowledgeable they are, they looked fluffier from a far he woke and found a cloud so loud hovering over his thoughtless head. The cloud, as fluffy and white as a sheep flying a thoughtless kite. He had a thought not of the cloud and the moon who hadn‚Äôt fought, but instead of the temple of hay which was now stripped away, from its colorless array of brown and grey hay. He entered with a mind with wonders unknown whose answers were a step away, if only he had thrown away the blade, for it had caught a stray to murder this man without a thought. His body and blood will lay till they rot. It slit his neck no hesitation, for death was a painful sensation.

## Short Story 2: The Wild Child

A child got lost at a very young age, and wandered in to a deep forest. As he aged he started to become more comfortable with the wild. He learned the languages of the animals, and learned how to act like them. As he grew older he was raised by some of the animals, taught how to hunt, gather, and to scavenge. But as he grew to be an adult he fell out of touch with the animals, and began to feel lonely. He knew he was not with his kind and could tell he didn‚Äôt belong. He began to feel an immense hunger, not for food, but for another person. So he searched he searched far and wide for his kind. He enjoyed the journey, traveling through nature, eating berries or whatever else he could find, meat was a special treat, going as much as a day without water. Finally after a while he gave up, and settled at a small waterfall, where he could wash himself, drink, eat the animals attracted to the water, and the plants that grew by it. However whilst he searched for the outside world, the outside world searched for him. Outside of his knowing, his mother was beginning to grow old and she wondered if her son was still alive or where he could possibly be. The world searched for him to help this mother get her last wish. Water also attracts people, so he was found soon, a few months later. After living his whole life in those woods, he was brought to civilization, at first he resisted the people ushering him to their vehicles, but he finally gave in and realized this is what he wanted, to be with his kind. He was taken, cleaned, fed, given a bed and small house, and a teacher was hired to teach him the language of the people. It took a while and after some time he took a DNA test and it matched with his mother, who was in hospice care. It took some time but finally he understood some of the basics of the humans, and was taken to visit his dying mother. They met and she was overjoyed. The man was confused, but her tears and laughter overwhelmed him, they embraced and that night she died, with a smile on her face, knowing that was the best, happiest, and most fulfilling day of her life. But without his mother he again grew lonely, the people introduced him to God and that helped for a while, but all he thought about was his old life back at home. The forest. One night he escaped and ran, his new shoes weren‚Äôt built for his wild feet, he ran with all of the energy of the trees and the sun, and the moon on the horizon. Finally he made it. It took some searching but he found a good place to settle down in. Days passed, nights flew by. He only thought of his mother, and one day meeting her again. One night he was very hungry, so he found a berry bush. He didn‚Äôt notice the bear that snuck on him. It attacked and he tried to defend himself, but what was he to do, with such a large beast pouring over him with one intention. That night he was brutally injured and could not move. The woods he roamed since a child. But was he really meant for the wild? That night he closed his eyes with his last bit of energy and got his last and final wish.

## Short Story 3: Office Life

He peered out of his office window. When would it end? The late nights, the early mornings, the few hours of interrupted sleep. The pain. He saw a chickadee perch along a rooftop. A hawk swooping down. Death. A meal. He turned his head back to his computer not caring at all. Numbers. Charts. Thoughts of freedom. Sleep. His children. The pain ate at his heart. Then the deceased chickadee‚Äôs building started to shake. It cracked. It fell. He looked back at his computer. Numbers. Charts. Thoughts of Freedom. Sleep. His children. His eyesight got blurry. The screen pained to look at. The symbols on screen morphed together. He blinked. Nothing. He blinked again. Nothing. Gunshots. Screams. His computer screen. Numbers. Charts. Thoughts of freedom. Sleep. His children. His door creaked open. His boss came inside. Bags under his eyes. Coffee in his hands. A frown on his face. The door creaked when it shut. His boss‚Äôs footsteps getting quieter. Lunch. A stale cookie. Lukewarm coffee. A smile on a coworkers face. The frown on his. The clock ticking. Back to work. Numbers. Charts. Thoughts of Freedom. Sleep. His children. Eyelids getting heavy. Lukewarm coffee. Motivation. Pushing through. Sun fading. Depression. Unwillingness to care. He looked back at his computer. A thud. Another thud. Hail. Rain. A crack in the dark sky. Lightning. Power outage. His computer went dark. He laid back in his chair. He blinked. Middle of the night. His car. The thirty minute drive back home. Fifteen minutes. Red light. Car crash. Not his. He looked back to his steering wheel. Back on the road. Low gas. Long drive to the next gas station. His car sputtered to a stop. A sigh. He opened the door. He started walking. A fallen branch. The ground hit his face. The mud. The rain. He got back up. He didn‚Äôt think it could get any worse. He woke in his small bed covered by heavy sheets. Lightning lit up the sky. He got up. Washed his face with cold water. He put his suit back on. He sighed.

## Short Story 4: The Cove

I look out the glass of my enclosure. I was born in this container, imprisoned from the outside world. I swam to the other side, and looked upwards. It would be feeding time soon. The fish in my bedroom sized tank were colorful, mindless, and empty in the heart. They found no problem with their illegal containment, no matter how little food they get, no matter how little care they get. I care. Our rich captor‚Äôs minion drops little specks of food from the top of the tank. That‚Äôs the only amount we‚Äôll get today. I swiftly swim up and steal some tip-off the larger particles. The mindless fish just keep swimming, not entranced until their measly brains process the meal. I swim back to the sandy floor and enter my small shelter of rocks. My stomach aches with hunger. I have been underfed, my rough skin is looking pale today. As one of the rocks slides out of place and begins to fall, I quickly adjust it with one of my tentacles. I decide that some rest might do me quite well, and I float in to a subconscious state of mind. I dream of the ocean the sea, somehow I know it is out there, more water than I live in yearning to escape. I dream of pattering, perhaps rain coming down on the rooftop. Suddenly I wake, it is the middle of the night and not a sound but the sand beneath me, and the dripping of water outside of my enclosure. I swim up to the top I of the glass and peer outside, if only there was a small gap, or‚Ä¶. I swim back to the floor, mind floating to the possibilities. If only. Not much happens at night and I still need rest so I swim back to my shelter. I dream of pattering again. I wake abruptly to light shining down from the usually dark alleyway leading to my enclosure. Footsteps. The fat, rich man that owns me and all of my neighbors walks in leading a woman, a young girl, and an even younger boy holding her hand. My captor twirls his mustache, and walks up to my enclosure. I hear muffled talking as he tells them about all of the colorful, still mindless fish swimming around in my tank. I swim back to my shelter of rocks and lay there bored. Just another one of the rich collectors wanting to see us. I hear a familiar noise and turn, pattering coming from the boy tapping on the glass, inconsiderate, but nevertheless I move along the floor towards him. The boy speaks and somehow I understand every bit. 
‚ÄúI can help you escape. I know you don‚Äôt like being constricted.‚Äù 
Entranced I look away, secretly agreeing.
‚ÄúNo?‚Äù The boy says, and I look back knowing it is true.
‚ÄúWell then, listen to me. I will cause a distraction at night and you can just slip out, of that hole at the top.‚Äù And he points to the top, enjoyment in his eyes. I dart back to my shelter, contemplating whether I want to or not. Even the fish wouldn‚Äôt be stupid enough to turn up this once in a lifetime, life altering opportunity. And so at feeding time I get the most I can, because I might not have much food very soon. I stay up wide awake at night waiting for the distraction, the small interruption that might pull away a guard. That‚Äôs when I hear it an alarm, and alarm to what I don‚Äôt know but I know that this is it, my moment. That‚Äôs when I hear what sounds like a young child‚Äôs wailing, another distraction. Perfect. I swim to the top of the enclosure scanning for a hole, just above the water, when I see it, the size of a dime but I am relatively small and I manage to slide through. I creep down the glass leaving a trail of water showing my escape. The alarms suddenly stop but the wailing continues. I have to hurry. I creep down the alleyway as fast as I possibly can, which is admittedly not too fast. But nevertheless I make it to a door, and the space under it gives me much more space than to hole. Suddenly, I am outside I must have chosen the right door. I creep down the empty sidewalks and look up at the palm trees towering over my head. I hear waves crashing and I know I must be close to the ocean, my home where I had never been. I creep towards it, and feeling a rush of adrenaline, I pick up the pace. I make it to a white sand beach outside of a cove and slowly creep to the edge of the water. I look back for what I hope is my last time, and I disappear into the sea.

## Short Story 5: The Window

The man sat in a wooden chair, looking directly out his window. It would rain soon. The clouds moved in, and the man continued to watch. After a while, the rain started to fall. The man sat in his char looking at the gray clouds, they looked like they came right out of a painting. He sat there with his thoughts, no one in his small house but himself. The rain intensified, coming down like bullets against his house. He continued to sit there and watch. Soon, a banging noise occurred like someone was hitting golf balls at his house. Hail. He continued to watch, not a movement in his wrinkled face. He thought about how his dog used to love to go for walks after rainfall. Oh how he would have enjoyed this moment. The hail pounded against
The glass. He watched, unfazed. A leak above, dripped a raindrop. It rolled down the man‚Äôs cheek. He didn‚Äôt bother to wipe it off. Inside, a monster ate at his heart, he had lost everyone, everything. He watched the rain come to an end. A brief moment of pause, only giving a break before it came down even harder. Another raindrop rolled down his cheek. He sat there in his chair and crouched over. He was getting old. His back hurt even as he sat in his chair. The rain intensified again and the hail got bigger. The rain started to collect on the ground. Another raindrop rolled down his cheek and he sat up and walked over to his sink. He turned on the faucet with cold water, grabbed a towel and wiped his face. He walked back to his chair and sat down, bored. He had no one to talk to, just a small conversation could change everything. He heard what sounded like a knock on his door and turned his head to look. Nothing. The hail continued to pound, and he turned his head back, and looked out of his window. The clouds consumed the light and it got dark. The trees cast shadows of long eerie, long fingered figures, and the mud only made the sight sadder. He watched as the rain intensified highly, and a flood of water came rolling down the hill outside. A wave of water rushed at his small house. He didn‚Äôt move a muscle. The water came at a forceful speed, and broke through his window and his door. The wave of water rushed toward him and engulfed his body, and his sadness.

However, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I should be concerned that he still stays in contact with his ex-girlfriend.

I‚Äôd been living in that quiet Wylie suburb for a few years when the Gores moved in down the street. My husband and I mostly kept to ourselves‚Äîquick nods over the fence, the occasional chat about the weather. Betty Gore always had a smile ready, though sometimes it looked like she‚Äôd put it on like lipstick, just another part of her morning routine. She taught at the local elementary school, chased after her two little girls‚ÄîAlisa, bright and talkative, and baby Bethany, still in diapers. Her husband Allan traveled often for work, gone days at a time.

Candy Montgomery lived just a couple streets over, but everyone knew her from church. Candy was bubbly, the kind of person who always volunteered to run the bake sale or organize the Christmas pageant. She had her own husband, Pat, and two kids. On the surface it all felt like a Norman Rockwell painting of small-town Texas‚Äîchurch potlucks, kids on bikes, neat lawns. Ordinary. Safe. Until that one Friday in June 1980.

That morning began like any other. I was folding laundry, the hum of the dryer filling the kitchen, when the phone rang. Allan Gore‚Äôs voice on the other end sounded strained.  
‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs Allan,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm up in Minnesota for work, and I can‚Äôt get ahold of Betty. She‚Äôs not picking up the phone. Could you and your husband check on her? The girls should be there too.‚Äù

I paused, the receiver cold against my ear. ‚ÄúSure, Allan. Probably just out running errands or something. We‚Äôll head over right now.‚Äù

My husband was in the garage tinkering with his car. When I told him, he wiped his hands and we walked the short distance to the Gores‚Äô house. From the outside, everything looked normal‚Äîthe curtains drawn, no car missing, the quiet of midday hanging over the street. We knocked a few times, called out Betty‚Äôs name. Nothing. My husband tried the door. It swung open easily. That was odd. Betty was careful about locking up, especially with two kids in the house.

Inside, the air felt heavy, still. A faint metallic smell drifted toward us. ‚ÄúBetty? Alisa?‚Äù I called, my voice softer now. The living room looked normal, toys scattered like breadcrumbs across the carpet. Then, from down the hall, came a faint cry‚Äîthin, insistent.

We followed the sound to the baby‚Äôs room. Bethany was in her crib, her diaper soaked, her little face red and wet from hours of crying. My husband scooped her up, rocking her gently. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Betty?‚Äù he muttered, scanning the hallway.

I moved toward the kitchen, my steps slow. That smell again‚Äîcopper and something else, thick enough to taste. On the linoleum, I noticed dark smudges leading to the utility room. At first, I thought it was mud or spilled paint. But as I drew closer, the odor sharpened, like pennies left to rust in a hot car. My hand trembled as I pushed the utility room door open.

What I saw made my knees give out. Betty lay on the floor, her body twisted, surrounded by a spreading pool of red that glistened under the fluorescent light. Her face was unrecognizable, slashed open, and beside her lay an axe, its blade crusted and dark. For a second, I couldn‚Äôt even breathe. A sound rose in my throat but stuck there. My husband came running at my gasp, saw what I‚Äôd seen, and pulled me back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look,‚Äù he whispered, his voice cracking. He grabbed the kitchen phone, his fingers shaking, and dialed the police. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a murder. Betty Gore‚Äîshe‚Äôs dead. Send help quick.‚Äù

The police arrived fast, lights flashing against the neat houses. They taped off the entryway, ushered us outside, and began their questions‚Äîwhen had we last seen Betty, had we noticed anything unusual. While we waited, Allan called again, his voice sharper now.  
‚ÄúWhat happened? Is Betty okay? The girls?‚Äù

I took the phone from my husband. ‚ÄúAllan‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad. Betty‚Äôs gone. The police are here. Bethany‚Äôs safe, but Alisa‚Äîshe‚Äôs not home.‚Äù

Silence. Then: ‚ÄúAlisa‚Äôs with Candy. She stayed over after Vacation Bible School. I‚Äôll call her.‚Äù

That night, after the police let us go, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Every creak in our house made me jump. Allan flew back the next day, pale and shattered. He told police about his affair with Candy‚Äîhow it had ended, but how Betty had found out. Candy had been the last person to see Betty alive, stopping by that morning to pick up Alisa‚Äôs swimsuit.

Whispers spread like wildfire. People said Candy and Betty had argued. I remembered seeing Candy at church, always so composed, always smiling. But now, little moments resurfaced. A few weeks earlier, I‚Äôd run into Betty at the grocery store. She‚Äôd looked tired, eyes swollen.  
‚ÄúEverything all right?‚Äù I asked.  
She forced a laugh. ‚ÄúJust the usual. Allan‚Äôs away again, and the baby‚Äôs teething. Candy‚Äôs been a big help, though.‚Äù  
Her hands gripped the cart so tightly her knuckles whitened.

The police came to our door again. ‚ÄúDid you notice anything strange between the Gores and the Montgomerys?‚Äù the detective asked. My husband shook his head. ‚ÄúThey seemed like friends. Church pals.‚Äù But I recalled a barbecue last summer. Candy and Allan had laughed a little too long over some joke, while Betty sat at the picnic table, poking at her plate. It hadn‚Äôt seemed like much then.

Days turned to weeks. The Gore house stood empty and dark. I‚Äôd walk past and feel eyes on me, even though no one was there. One evening, I was in my backyard hanging clothes when a car pulled up next door. It was Candy, dropping off some of Alisa‚Äôs things for Allan. She waved at me. ‚ÄúHorrible, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù she said, her voice steady. ‚ÄúPoor Betty. I can‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù

I nodded, but my skin prickled. Why was she out on bail? News trickled out: Betty had confronted Candy about the affair. Candy claimed Betty had lunged at her with the axe. She said she fought back in self-defense‚Äîstriking Betty over and over until she stopped moving. Forty-one times. That number stuck in my head, brutal and endless.

At the trial that fall, everything spilled into the open. Candy took the stand, her voice soft, her expression calm. ‚ÄúShe came at me with the axe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was scared for my life. I grabbed it and‚Ä¶ I just kept swinging until the threat was gone.‚Äù

The prosecutor leaned forward. ‚ÄúForty-one blows? That‚Äôs not defense‚Äîthat‚Äôs rage.‚Äù

Her lawyer countered with a doctor who claimed hypnosis had uncovered Candy‚Äôs repressed childhood anger. The jury listened. After hours of deliberation, they found her not guilty. The courtroom erupted. Allan sat stone-faced, holding Alisa‚Äôs hand.

Life went on‚Äîor tried to. But at night, lying awake, I‚Äôd imagine Betty‚Äôs last moments‚Äîthe flash of the blade, the pain. And Candy, walking free, smiling maybe, going back to church. We‚Äôd see her sometimes around town, and I‚Äôd cross the street. Because once you know what a neighbor can do‚Äîhide an affair, wield an axe, walk away‚Äîyou never feel safe again. Every locked door, every shadow in a window, is a reminder: evil can live right next door, wearing a friendly face.





# ""A Quiet Street"":

The trouble started small‚Äîso small, it barely felt like trouble at all. A missing birthday gift for our daughter Ava. It had been left on the porch by a friend, a simple wrapped box, now gone. I accused Gary Hembree‚Äôs daughter across the street. Gary came over that evening, his face already flushed, knocking hard on our door.

‚ÄúBarbara, why are you blaming my kid?‚Äù he barked the moment I opened it. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt take anything.‚Äù

I stood my ground. ‚ÄúThings don‚Äôt just disappear, Gary. Kids play around here all the time.‚Äù

He shook his head and turned away, but that was the spark. From then on, little things built up, like cracks creeping through a wall you don‚Äôt notice until the whole house shifts.

We lived on Smith Drive in Titusville, Florida, a stretch of asphalt where families like ours tried to keep their heads above water. My husband, Billy, had served in the Army during the first Gulf War. He came back changed‚Äîpains he never talked about, nightmares that woke him sweating. He kept chickens in the backyard, twenty of them clucking softly, a strange therapy he said helped calm his mind. Our two kids loved scattering feed, their giggles rising like bright notes over the birds.

Across from us lived Gary with his girlfriend Kim Sillsbury and his friend Roger Picior, always hanging around. Next door to them were Tim and Keri Blake, who used to be close to us once upon a time. Our kids had played together in the yards, barefoot, laughing. But after the gift incident, Gary reported our chickens to the city. Billy had to kill them all. I watched him do it, axe in hand, his face blank and tight.

‚ÄúThis is wrong, Barbara,‚Äù he said quietly, not looking at me. ‚ÄúGary did this to hurt us.‚Äù

I nodded, feeling anger take root like a thorn.

After that, calls to the police became routine. Billy reported Gary for parking his truck on the grass. Gary reported noise from our house. One day, Keri Blake came over with a folded piece of paper in her hand.

‚ÄúBarbara, you need to control Billy,‚Äù she said, her voice clipped. It was a notice. She and Roger‚Äôs girlfriend had gotten a protection order against him for staring too long.

I laughed at first. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs silly, Keri. He‚Äôs just watching the street.‚Äù

But her eyes stayed cold. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not silly. He‚Äôs scaring people.‚Äù

Billy overheard and went quiet. Later, he told me, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ganging up on us. I hear them talking.‚Äù

The court date came soon after. We all went before a judge for injunctions‚ÄîBilly against Gary and the others; they against Billy. Stories spilled out like dirty laundry‚Äîstolen items, threats yelled across lawns. The judge listened, stone-faced.

‚ÄúGo home and sort it out,‚Äù he said at last, denying everything.

Outside, in the parking lot, the tension cracked. Billy lunged at Gary, punching him hard enough to leave bruises. Police arrested Billy, but he was out quick. Gary looked at me as Billy walked away from the station.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over, Barbara,‚Äù he muttered.

I felt a knot form inside, wondering what he meant.

Weeks passed with more shouting. One night Billy played me a recording he‚Äôd made from across the street. Voices whispered through the static: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get him‚Ä¶ make him pay.‚Äù Then laughter, low and ugly. Billy‚Äôs eyes were wide.

‚ÄúSee? They‚Äôre planning something.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just talk, Billy,‚Äù I tried to soothe him.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúKim said she‚Äôd have Ava hurt bad. Rape, Barbara. Our girl.‚Äù

I gasped. ‚ÄúWho told you that?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeri mentioned it in passing, like a warning.‚Äù

From then on, I held Ava closer, checked the locks twice every night.

Labor Day weekend arrived, hot and airless. Voices carried from Gary‚Äôs barbecue‚Äîlaughter, music, clinking bottles. Billy paced the house like a caged animal.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre out there now,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúPlotting.‚Äù

I put the kids to bed early. ‚ÄúMom, why is Dad upset?‚Äù Ava asked.

‚ÄúJust tired, sweetie,‚Äù I told her, kissing her forehead.

Billy sat by the window, staring out into the dark. Midnight came. I tried to sleep but couldn‚Äôt. Sometime after, Billy slipped outside. I thought he needed air.

Gunshots cracked the night‚Äîsharp, one after another. I sat up, heart hammering. More shots, then screams. I ran to the window.

Across the street, figures moved in the dark. Roger‚Äôs son cried out, ‚ÄúDad!‚Äù I saw Billy moving with a gun in his hand. He shot Roger first, right there in Gary‚Äôs yard, blood spreading fast. Then he crossed to Tim‚Äôs carport. Tim stood there, confused, hands half-raised. Billy fired eleven times. Tim jerked with each hit, collapsing slow. Gary came out his door, shouting, ‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî‚Äù before a shot to his chest dropped him. Billy walked back to Roger, who groaned on the ground, and fired twice more into his head.

Silence followed, broken only by distant sirens.

I stood frozen at the window, hands over my mouth. Billy came back inside, the gun empty, his face pale.

‚ÄúThey were coming for us, Barbara,‚Äù he said, his voice steady but eyes wild. ‚ÄúI heard them say it‚Äîget Billy tonight.‚Äù

Police arrived soon, red and blue lights flashing against the houses. They took Billy away in cuffs. I answered questions in a daze.

‚ÄúHe thought we were in danger,‚Äù I told the officer. ‚ÄúThe threats were real.‚Äù

Gary and Roger died that night. Tim lived, but scarred forever. Billy went to jail, claiming self-defense under the law. Years later at the hearing, his lawyers played the recordings‚Äîtaunts, plans whispered. Some neighbors even spoke for him, saying the bullying was constant. But the judge didn‚Äôt buy it.

‚ÄúYou struck first. Unnecessary,‚Äù the judge ruled.

Billy now faces trial for murder and attempted murder.

Nights are quiet on Smith Drive again, but I still check the locks. The kids ask about their father. And I still wonder if the voices Billy heard were real‚Äîor only in his head. Either way, the fear lingers, a shadow in every corner. What starts small can end in blood, and once-trusted faces can turn into strangers with dark intent.





# ""The Lot Next Door"":

I had been living with James for about two years when we found that little rental on a quiet road in Encinitas. It seemed perfect at first‚Äîsunlight slanting through pepper trees, the ocean breeze sneaking in at night, a slice of calm where James could edit his films and I could design from home. James had a warmth about him that drew people in. He‚Äôd listen, really listen, and offer help without making you feel like you owed him. I‚Äôd always been more private, more observant. Maybe that‚Äôs why I noticed things sooner.

Our backyard backed onto an overgrown lot owned by our neighbor, Victor. At first, he just looked like any solitary man in his late fifties, the kind who tinkers with his land instead of talking to people. But there was something relentless about him‚Äîhow he attacked his property like it was an enemy to be conquered. Every morning before sunrise we‚Äôd hear the scrape of his shovel, the snap of branches, the drag of brush across dry soil.

He started with the tall pepper trees lining the strip by our door‚Äîthe only barrier between us and the road. I remember the first time James tried to talk to him. I was in the kitchen making coffee, watching from the window as James stepped outside, palms open in a neighborly gesture.

‚ÄúHey, neighbor,‚Äù James called out. ‚ÄúMind if we chat about these trees? They‚Äôre on your land, I know, but they give us some privacy. Maybe you could leave a few?‚Äù

Victor stopped sawing. His eyes, narrow under thick brows, flicked toward James. Sweat rolled down his temple, but his stare didn‚Äôt waver.  
‚ÄúThis is my property,‚Äù he said, his accent thick, hard to place. ‚ÄúI clear what I want. You don‚Äôt tell me.‚Äù

James nodded slowly, still calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not telling you anything. Just asking. It affects us, too.‚Äù

Victor‚Äôs grip tightened on the saw. ‚ÄúYou live on rent. This is mine forever. Go back inside.‚Äù

James returned shaking his head. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs stubborn,‚Äù he muttered, pouring himself a cup of coffee. ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôll ease up if we leave him be.‚Äù

But Victor didn‚Äôt ease up. If anything, he escalated. The chopping grew louder, earlier. His glances at our house lingered, cold and unreadable. It felt like he wasn‚Äôt just clearing land‚Äîhe was clearing us out, piece by piece.

Weeks passed. Our front yard felt naked without the trees. Victor muttered to himself as he worked, words too low to understand but sharp in tone. When James tried again to speak to him, asking him to cut back the noise, Victor‚Äôs face reddened like a warning light.  
‚ÄúYou yell at me?‚Äù he snapped, leaning on his shovel. ‚ÄúYou think you own this? You stop bothering me, or there will be trouble.‚Äù

James kept his voice steady. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just asking for some consideration.‚Äù

Victor‚Äôs eyes flashed. ‚ÄúConsideration? You harass me. Like a bully. I see how you are.‚Äù

That night James sat on the couch, staring at nothing. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs twisting everything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaking me the bad guy.‚Äù

I started to dread the sound of Victor‚Äôs tools. It wasn‚Äôt just noise‚Äîit was a signal, a rhythm of tension building outside our walls. I‚Äôd catch him staring at our windows while raking, his expression blank but heavy. Once I waved, trying to be polite. He turned away without a word.

Then came the note. A single sheet taped to our door, blocky handwriting pressed into the paper:  
‚ÄúStop watching me. My land. Your problem if you push.‚Äù

I showed it to James, my hands shaking. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs accusing us of watching him now?‚Äù

James crumpled the note. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs paranoid. I‚Äôll talk to him tomorrow. Calmly.‚Äù

The next day, James tried. I cracked the window to listen.  
‚ÄúVictor, about that note,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not watching you. We just live here. Can we find a way to get along?‚Äù

Victor dropped his rake and stepped closer. ‚ÄúGet along? You scream at me, threaten me. Every day you come out, yelling to stop. You act like criminal!‚Äù

‚ÄúI never threatened you,‚Äù James said, raising his hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to be reasonable.‚Äù

‚ÄúReasonable?‚Äù Victor spat the word. ‚ÄúI fear you. You come at me one day, I know it. Stay away!‚Äù

James came back inside, jaw tight. ‚ÄúHe says he‚Äôs afraid of me. Me!‚Äù

I touched his arm. ‚ÄúMaybe we should move. This isn‚Äôt worth it.‚Äù

But James wouldn‚Äôt. He loved that house, loved his work, and didn‚Äôt want to uproot everything over a neighbor. Still, I saw the shift in him. He checked the locks more. He kept his phone nearby, even in the yard. And always, Victor‚Äôs chopping. Day and night.

Then came the morning it all broke. I was in the shower, steam curling against the glass, when I heard James‚Äôs voice through the water: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs out there again, right in front.‚Äù

By the time I dried off, he was already outside. I called after him, ‚ÄúWait‚Äîdon‚Äôt confront him today!‚Äù but the door had closed.

From the kitchen window, I saw them. Victor stood at the edge of our driveway, a bag slung over his shoulder, tools dangling from his hands. His face was a storm.

‚ÄúVictor, enough!‚Äù James shouted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on my driveway now? This has to stop.‚Äù

Victor‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúYour driveway? This is my path. You come at me again!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police,‚Äù James said, holding up his phone. ‚ÄúBack off.‚Äù

Victor‚Äôs hand darted into the bag. His voice cracked. ‚ÄúYou threaten me? I defend myself!‚Äù

A sharp crack split the air. James staggered, clutching his side. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?‚Äù Another shot rang out. He fell.

I ran barefoot onto the pavement. ‚ÄúJames! Oh God, James!‚Äù

Victor stood there, gun in hand, his face blank as stone. He looked at me, just for a heartbeat, then turned and walked away, pulling out his phone like it was an errand.

I dropped to my knees, pressing my hands to James‚Äôs wounds, blood warm and slick under my palms. ‚ÄúHold on, please hold on,‚Äù I whispered, but his eyes had already started to fade.

The sirens came eventually. The police arrested Victor. At trial, he claimed self-defense. He said James threatened him, that he thought the phone was a gun. He painted James as the aggressor, the man who pushed him too far. But the jury didn‚Äôt buy it. They convicted him of murder.

Years later, I still hear it‚Äîthe scrape of a shovel, the chop of wood before dawn. I still check the yards around me, scanning for shadows. Neighbors are supposed to be safe. Victor taught me how wrong that can be.





# ""The Girl in the Basement"":

I never thought leaving home with my sister would lead to something so awful. Our parents worked the carnival circuit, always on the move, and that summer in 1965, they decided to leave Sylvia and me with a woman named Gertrude in Indianapolis. They said it would only be for a few weeks‚Äîjust long enough for them to finish the season. Gertrude had a house full of kids, and she‚Äôd agreed to take us in for twenty dollars a week. It seemed fair enough. My parents believed we‚Äôd be safe.

We arrived one humid afternoon on East New York Street, carrying two small suitcases and the kind of nervous hope that comes with meeting someone new. Gertrude Baniszewski opened the door in a faded housecoat, her face pale and drawn, cigarette dangling from her lips. Smoke curled around her as she looked us over.  
‚ÄúCome on in, girls,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll fit right in here.‚Äù

At first, things didn‚Äôt seem so bad. The house was crowded‚Äîseven kids already lived there‚Äîand the walls felt thin with noise and life. The wallpaper peeled, dishes stacked in the sink, and the air smelled faintly of stale bread and ash. Sylvia, sixteen, was the outgoing one. She had this bright laugh that filled the room, and she loved singing Beatles songs while helping with chores. I was fifteen, quieter, still a little self-conscious from the limp left by my bout with polio. We shared an upstairs room with Gertrude‚Äôs daughters, Paula and Stephanie, who were about our age.

It was messy but manageable‚Äîuntil that first check came late.

Gertrude changed overnight. One evening she sat us down at the kitchen table, her voice cold and sharp. ‚ÄúI took care of you two for nothing this week,‚Äù she said, eyes narrowing on Sylvia. ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù  
Sylvia tried to calm her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll come soon, Mrs. Baniszewski. Dad promised.‚Äù  
Gertrude just exhaled smoke through her nose and muttered, ‚ÄúPromises don‚Äôt put food on my table.‚Äù

The next day, when the mailman came empty-handed again, Gertrude grabbed a wooden paddle off the wall. She made Sylvia bend over and struck her across the back. The crack echoed through the kitchen. Sylvia flinched but didn‚Äôt cry. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for the trouble,‚Äù Gertrude said.  
I froze. My stomach twisted.  
When she turned toward me, Sylvia stepped forward. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hit Jenny,‚Äù she pleaded. ‚ÄúIt was my fault. I ate extra at supper.‚Äù  
Gertrude hesitated, then nodded. ‚ÄúFine. You‚Äôll take hers too.‚Äù  
And she hit her again, harder this time.

That was the beginning.

From then on, it was like Gertrude had found someone to pour her anger into. Every day, there was a new reason to lash out‚ÄîSylvia‚Äôs looks, her laughter, even her kindness. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre better than my girls?‚Äù Gertrude would sneer. Paula joined in quickly, shoving Sylvia into walls or calling her ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù Sometimes Gertrude just sat back, watching, a faint smirk under the smoke from her cigarette.

One afternoon after church, Gertrude accused Sylvia of stealing candy from a store. Sylvia shook her head, voice trembling. ‚ÄúI bought it with my own money, I swear.‚Äù  
‚ÄúLiar,‚Äù Gertrude hissed, and slapped her across the face.  
Paula laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, think you‚Äôre so innocent?‚Äù  
That night, Gertrude made Sylvia skip supper. I couldn‚Äôt stand it‚ÄîI slipped her a crust of bread under the table. John, one of the younger boys, saw and shouted, ‚ÄúJenny‚Äôs helping her!‚Äù  
Gertrude turned on me. ‚ÄúYou want to share her punishment?‚Äù  
I shook my head so hard my neck hurt.

Things only grew darker.

Gertrude began telling people Sylvia was ‚Äúloose,‚Äù spreading lies that she was pregnant or sleeping around. She‚Äôd say it with this strange, satisfied tone, as if she wanted to convince herself it was true. When neighborhood kids came over, they‚Äôd join in, laughing, mocking, hitting. A boy named Coy‚ÄîStephanie‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äîused Sylvia as a punching bag, flipping her to the ground under the excuse of ‚Äúpractice.‚Äù Her arms bloomed with bruises. I begged him to stop once, and he sneered at me. ‚ÄúMind your business, limp girl.‚Äù

The house turned into a world of cruelty, sealed off from reason. Neighbors came by sometimes, saw bruises, heard screams‚Äîbut no one interfered. One woman, Phyllis, saw Paula shove Sylvia in the yard and just said, ‚ÄúKids these days,‚Äù before walking home. The walls of that house might as well have been a prison.

By September, Gertrude had convinced herself Sylvia was evil. She called her names, starved her, humiliated her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fit to live with decent people,‚Äù she‚Äôd spit. The punishments turned sadistic‚Äîforcing Sylvia to eat spoiled food or hot dogs buried in condiments until she vomited, then making her eat it again. They burned her with cigarettes, scalded her with hot water. Once, Gertrude handed a match to her son John and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how tough she really is.‚Äù He pressed it to Sylvia‚Äôs skin.

When Sylvia cried, Gertrude just said, ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll clean you out.‚Äù

By October, Sylvia couldn‚Äôt walk right. Her body was a map of wounds. Gertrude locked her in the basement‚Äîcold, bare concrete under her, nothing to wear, nothing to eat. The air down there was damp, heavy with mildew. I sneaked her water when I could, whispering through the door. ‚ÄúHold on, Sylvia. Please.‚Äù  
She‚Äôd whisper back, her voice so small. ‚ÄúJenny‚Ä¶ I just want to go home.‚Äù

The worst came when Gertrude decided to ‚Äúmark‚Äù her. She heated a needle over the stove until it glowed red. The room smelled like burning metal. ‚ÄúHold her down,‚Äù she ordered. Paula and John pinned Sylvia‚Äôs arms. Gertrude bent close and carved into her stomach: *I‚ÄôM A PROSTITUTE.*  
Sylvia screamed until her voice broke.  
Then Gertrude handed the needle to a neighborhood boy, Richard Hobbs. ‚ÄúFinish it,‚Äù she said. He added the rest‚Äî*AND PROUD OF IT*‚Äîhis hand trembling as blood ran down Sylvia‚Äôs side.

After that, Sylvia barely spoke. Gertrude forced her to write a fake letter saying she‚Äôd run away with a gang of boys who had done this to her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll dump you in the woods,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll make it look real.‚Äù

The night before they planned to take her, Sylvia whispered to me, barely conscious. ‚ÄúJenny‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm dying.‚Äù  
I held her hand and sobbed. ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt say that.‚Äù  
Her breathing grew shallow. Her eyes unfocused. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Gertrude found her still body, she nudged it with a book. ‚ÄúGet up, faker.‚Äù  
But Sylvia didn‚Äôt move.

The panic came too late. They called the police, waving that letter around like proof. But when an officer crouched near me and asked softly what happened, I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore. I told him everything‚Äîevery bruise, every night, every scream.

They arrested Gertrude, Paula, and the others. The trial dragged on for months. Everyone blamed someone else, but nothing could erase what had happened in that small, ordinary house.

Gertrude was sentenced to life, though she got out years later. She died old, free, while Sylvia never got the chance to grow up.

Sometimes I still see her‚Äîsixteen, laughing under the summer sun, full of songs and hope. And then I remember how it ended, and how close evil can live‚Äîright next door, behind a smile, in a place that once felt safe.",1,1759710507.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers‚Ä¶ this, this is what I‚Äôve been missing.
(‚ÄúAnd in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make‚Äù ‚Äì The Beatles.)


---

So hey,

I‚Äôm 27. I‚Äôm a doctor. From India.
And no, I won‚Äôt diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I‚Äôm more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I‚Äôm a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The ‚Äúquotes random Marvel lines in conversations‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äústill mad about how Interstellar messed with time‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äúloses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi‚Äù kind.

I fall hard for characters that don‚Äôt exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I‚Äôm the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that‚Äôs equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we‚Äôre not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(‚ÄúNot all those who wander are lost‚Äù ‚Äì Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists.
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping.
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1nz4gkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nz4gkp/bestfriend_vs_girlfriend_prior_to_the_wedding/,Bestfriend vs Girlfriend: Prior to the Wedding DRAMA,"For context, this is not my story. However, I am heavily involve as their friend and family (to my SIL).

My SIL (23F) just got married to my college guy friend (28M)‚Äîlet's call him SIL Hubby. Now, SIL Hubby has two girl bestfriends, but let's focus on one. Let's call her N (25F).

The thing is SIL and SIL Hubby had been friends for 8 years. They've known each other for that long time but never got involved to each other romantically until January of 2025. 

On the other hand, SIL Hubby had been ""bestfriends"" with N for around 6-8 years ago? I (25F) has been a close friend of these two since around the same time. I practically know their relationship and had been observant ever since. 

When we were in college, I sincerely thought that N and SIL Hubby has feelings for one another which they totally dismissed. Though I know that SIL Hubby doesn't really open up to N even though they are bestfriends. SIL Hubby, without me knowing, had been opening up to SIL and he's comfortable to do that since they reconnected (around 2023).

Fast forward to their relationship. January of 2025 when SIL hubby started to court SIL and they officially got together on May. 

Since the confession of feelings and official courtship (for context: SIL Hubby had been asking SIL on random dates since December of 2023, on the reason that he sees her as a younger girl friend, not knowing that he is ACTUALLY already inlove with SIL. SIL is SIL Hubby's first girlfriend), N had been an a-hole. She suddenly wants SIL Hubby's attention even though she practically didn't care about him at all before this relationship.

N had a failed relationship where she has been sincerely is the victim. Her partner cheated on her after 4 years of relationship (which is another story to tell). However, during these times, she casually still dates SIL Hubby even if her former partner isn't comfortable. I don't really like that idea since for me, respect to your partner should have been given despite having your so-called bestfriend. Limitations should be there which clearly they don't had at the time.

Going back to 2025, N had shown SIL disrespect a lot of times by constantly asking for SIL Hubby's attention, demanding for dates and such, until things got out of hand. The people in their environment started to talk and came up that N might have hidden feelings for SIL Hubby. Nowww, this talk got to N and then she completely shut everyone off. SIL Hubby tried to talk with her but she didn't like that so she said no. SIL and SIL Hubby then let go of the situation.

UNTIL, their other bestfriend (let's call her Y‚Äî27F) came back to our country. N played the victim. She basically antagonise everyone and told Y that SIL Hubby forgot their friendship when in fact she is the one who doesn't even know boundaries. 

SIL and SIL Hubby had been planning for their wedding for months now. Now, at first, N and Y was supposed to be invited. But when Y came back, the three of them had a fallout. SIL Hubby had been so gentle with them but it got to a point where he left N at a coffee shop after N said that they are now FO. 

So then, SIL and SIL Hubby proceeded with their wedding, it is a private wedding and only a few family and friends are invited. Now, it is out and N and Y had been crying ever since. They also posted on social media how they feel and how neglected they felt,.

I had been close with N too but she's been too problematic after her break up. At one time, she actually told SIL (this is when they were still hanging out before the relationship) that she hope that my husband (20M) would not cheat on me because she feels he is too young. I got offended by that. She also has problems with my bio sister's bf (25M) whom is her former close male friend. I know we are all close-knitted as a community so it might be challenging to follow up with all these people involved.

I feel like N had been so entitled nowadays. I personally came to hate her a bit with how she treated SIL and us as friends. She made a group chat before wanting to talk to us but not for reconciliation or to have a healthy talk. She just wanted to defend her actions which are clearly immature because she had shown disrespect. She felt that we did team up to hurt her or gossip about her but that's not the case. She had just been so entitled that she overpassed the boundary of being a bestfriend.

So basiclly I(15f) have been best friends with my next door naighbor(also 15f) since I can remember. Let‚Äôs call her Mia for the sake of privacy. We never had any big fights or really any fights lasting longer than a day until now. There‚Äôs also this girl(15f) we can call Zoey. I‚Äôve been on and of friends with her since we were 5. The reason for that is that she is lowkey toxic. The best example is how, last year, while claming to be my friend she would twist every joke I make or any coment I have into a way to make me the bad guy and it reached a point where I lost myself and really started to struggle with my mental helth. I‚Äôm all good now but I wasn‚Äôt about to let her do that again so I planed to lose touch with her during the summer but it wasn‚Äôt easy. 
Also she is solid friends with Mia so idk the 3 of us started hanging out again and a trio was formed. 

Now I did still remember everything from last year and was not about to let it happen again and I think I did a pretty good job up until teo weeks ago. And also Zoey was actually acting like a good friend during the summer. 

So school started and this thursday I have this 3 day class trip. That‚Äôs kind of where this whole thing started. There was a talk about how we will sit and I may have overreacted snd ended up in a fight with Mia. Or well it should have been with Mia but instead the whole time I was arguing with Zoey more. She claimed that she wasn‚Äôt chosing sides but she obviously was. Either way I realysed that I was kind of in the wrong and spent 5 days trying to apolagise to Mia but she wasn‚Äôt picking up my calls or evan opening my texts. On the 5th day of this afther school I told her to call me bcs I didn‚Äôt want to lose out friendship over this but guess what, she never did. I ended up getting sick and only got back to school this last thursday. 

So afther school as Mia and I were walking back home(not evan talking and I was like 5 ft behind her) I asked her why did she get so mad over such a dum argument that she couldn‚Äôt talk to me for 1 and a half week(we did talk in school but not much and mainley schoolwork related stuff). She firstly gave me some bs excuse about how she wasn‚Äôt talking to me bcs I wasn‚Äôt talking to her. I called her out right away bcs come on. I literally spent 5 days crying in my room afther she wouldn‚Äôt pick up bcs I thought I fucked up our friendship over nothing. But yeah in the end she said that, at the moment, she didn‚Äôt feel like talking to me. I asked her to then explain why was she so mad that she couldn‚Äôt talk with me bcs again it was a dum fight. She said she didn‚Äôt know either and then she went home. 

Ofc I got mad and went home where I talked about the whole thing eith my mom(we have a vary Lorelei/Rory Gilmore relationship) and she helped me understand that at this point it was no longer my foult bcs she was the one not talking to me. Afther that we spent the afthernoon eating ice cream, watching Gilmore girls and talking about the whole thing so yeah by the end I decited to not waste more of my energy on this until Mia shows that she is also interested in saving this friendship. 

Also I have this cousin(14f) that I‚Äôm really close with and while she lives kind of far away we talk every day and she basiclly told me the same thing as my mom. 

So last Friday(afther the whole ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel like talking‚Äù thing) in school we talked probably the most we have since this whole thing started. Especially during PE bcs we were on the same team while playing some sports. And when we were walking back home that day we ended up walking right next to eachother. It‚Äôs a really short walk and I spend a big part of it answering snaps and so since I expected her to again ignore me or idk what and rush so she would be in front but to my suprise she didn‚Äôt. 
At one point she evan fell back a bit but ended up catching up to me again. 
She really isn‚Äôt the type of person to have deep talks with and all that so I saw this as her way of raising a white flag. 

Then today, while I was over at a friends place, she called me. I didn‚Äôt see it until laither and then texted her asking why she called. She said it was an accident but again we haven‚Äôt talked in the past two weeks and she called me over the norm call so idk how could it be an accident but I might be overthinking this. 

Other than that haven‚Äôt really talked the whole weekend but thank God that‚Äôs where Zoey comes to bring back the heavoc. 

She still claims that she isn‚Äôt chosing sides but since the fight happened she has been attached to Mia to the point where its sad to watch. Also she keeps doing her best to mention, preferabley in front of me, how she is going to sit next to Mia on this trip. She also told me she couldn‚Äôt hang out this weekend but low and behold she went for coffee with Mia today. 

I was mad when I saw the snap so I left her on seen. She then went on to ask me why did I do that and I told her it was an accident since knew she was still with Mia so I didn‚Äôt wanna get into it. Then she asked did I also accidentaly leave Mia on seen. I told her no, that I left her on seen bcs she hasn‚Äôt returned a single snap to me in the past two weeks. She responded with an ‚Äúok i guess‚Äù like girl tf but ok. For some reason I asked her why she was wondering why I didn‚Äôt answer Mia but realised it was kind of a dum question and deleted it. She asked me about the deleted chat and I explained it to her. From that she somehow concluded that I didn‚Äôt think that she had the right to know what was going on when she has been involved in this fight since it hapened. 

Looking back she was straight of just trying to get a reaction out of me probably just to make me look bad in front of Mia. I say this bcs since this whole thing started she loves the fact that she is getting more atention than normal. If it turned out that this whole time Mia was mad at me bcs Zoey was bsing things that I said, I wouldn‚Äôt evan be suprised. Tbh that‚Äôs curently my main suspicion. Also my moms, cousins and the friends at whose house I was when Mia called. 

But yeah I‚Äôm fully ready to not talk with zoey ever again bcs this was her last shot and she blew it so idgaf if she tries to be friends again couse I ain‚Äôt doing it. When I think about it, it‚Äôs kind of obvious that she has just been tounting me this whole time and was just looking for that reaction but I ain‚Äôt giving her the plesure. My parents told me that the best thing I can do is just show that idc any more. 

Idk if I wanna make up with Mia, I am really mad she didn‚Äôt talk to me all this time but idk there might be more to the story than I know. Either way I‚Äôll just se what happens at school tomorow and then decite what to do when it comes to her. 

My main problem is that I have a lot of friends but all of them are in random friendgroups so it would be really weird if i just joined in for the trip this week but idk who else I can hang out with while there. 

So yeah, WIBTAH if I stoped talking to Zoey compleatly, what do I do about Mia and any advice regarding the school trip. 

Also to note I would apreciate if this dosen‚Äôt get on any platforms other that reddit bcs I know Mia watches reddit storyes on tt and this getting back to her would be hella akward especially if we don‚Äôt make up and then this becomes gossip matereal for her and Zoey.

1nz4c4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nz4c4f/hr_sleep_waking/,[HR] Sleep Waking,"With a jerk Will‚Äôs eyes shoot open. With a glance around, a chuckle escaped his lips. Turning around and entering his apartment he was greeted with a question. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you go so eerily in the morning? What, you got a lady friend I don‚Äôt know about?‚Äù joked Rick, Will's roommate and best friend. 

‚ÄúNo no, I just woke up out there.‚Äù Will expand getting a sigh from Rick. 

‚ÄúYou got outside this time, huh next thing you know you're going to be in Africa.‚Äù

Walking into the apartment carrying some groceries. He was once again greeted with a question. 

‚ÄúHey, um have you seen Smoky? I can not find her anywhere.‚Äù Rick asked, looking under the sink. 

‚ÄúNo. I was in class all day. Did you check my closet? She has been sleeping in there recently.‚Äù Will replied, setting the groceries on the counter. After putting the groceries away, they looked all around the apartment for Smoky, but came up with nothing. 

‚ÄúD-do you think... she could have gotten out?‚Äù Rick asked with a shaky breath. 

‚ÄúNo, no she couldn‚Äôt have-‚Äù Will froze. A panic expression ran down his face. ‚ÄúDo you think she got out while‚Ä¶ while I was sleep waking.‚Äù A week has passed since Smoky got out. Will and Rick did everything they could. They put up posters, asked the neighbors, and posted it online, but still nothing. Even Though it was Rick‚Äôs cat, Will loved her too and has been dying of guilt all week.¬†

Will once again awoke with a jerk. The first thing he noticed was a floating feeling. When his eyes unblurred he noticed 12 buttons. He comically realized where he was as a ding went off. The door of the elevator slid open to the eleventh floor and an older woman walked in. Will hit the fifth floor and with the request of the woman also hit ground. Lost in thought and the awkwardness of the elevator ride, Will lacked to notice the cut on his nightshirt and other small details like the dirt smell. Once he entered the apartment he followed his normal routine. He brushed his teeth, changed, packed his bag, had breakfast with Rick both trying to make the other feel better about Smoky, and then left for school. With a twenty minute drive and five minute walk Will arrived at his set as usual but his professor wasn‚Äôt there yet. Not thinking much of it, Will decided to work on an essay for another class, and it continued like that until fifteen minutes after class should have started when one of the other students packed up their things and left. Some people easily got up and left but like Will some had some hesitancy to leave. But due to the time that was passing Will decided to go to the library due to the quietness and closeness to his next class. Other than his professor not showing up and waking up in the elevator Will continued to have a normal day.

The next day Will had a little worse morning. Like the day before Will awoke in a different place. There was some type of background noise but Will didn‚Äôt focus on that but rather constant cold on his face. Regaining his senses he chuckled thinking he made it outside this time. Opening his eyes Will was immediately blinded by bright lights. After taking a minute Will was able to see again and take in his surroundings. A scream left his mouth as he looked over a bridge. Quickly backing up and turning around he was hit with another frite as several cars went by. It took him some time to regain himself again. In a panic Will checked his pockets frantically, and breathed a sigh of relief when he felt his phone. He called Rick and with a panicked explanation Rick was on his way to pick him up. 

‚ÄúSo where are you?‚Äù Rick asked. 

‚ÄúUm. I-I don‚Äôt know‚Äù Will shakily answers. 

‚ÄúHey, hey, calm down, everything is ok. You‚Äôre going to take a deep breath ok, then you're going to go into Google Maps and tell me where you are, got it.‚Äù Rick farmly started before calmly instructing him. Will did as instructed and in twenty-seven minutes Rick arrived.

When they got home Rick only let Will sit down before starting his interrogation. ‚ÄúHow the hell did you sleepwalk 27 minutes away from here?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBy car.‚Äù Will added tiredly instead of answering. 

‚ÄúBy car. What is that like 45 by foot‚Äù Rick continued exasperatedly. Seeing that this wasn‚Äôt going anywhere or helping Rick calmed down. ‚ÄúLook, *sigh* I didn‚Äôt mean to get frustrated, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm worried and I don‚Äôt want you to get hurt‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt control it and it‚Äôs just something we have to live with, so let's just get some more rest. We have an hour and a half left until we gotta get up ok?‚Äù Will gave a slow nod, but contrary to his agreement Will couldn't go back to sleep.

The week continued its weirdness as Will appeared miles away twice more and his professor was officially declared missing. The next time Will slept walked he made it twenty-nine minutes away by foot, and the other thirty-three, all in the same direction as the first. Because it was now the weekend along with the fear and panic attacks waking up miles away somewhere randomes brings Will decided to try and not go to sleep. With a lot of coffee and catching up and even getting ahead on some school work he made it Thursday. Watching his friend stumble around Rick decided to end this. 

‚ÄúHey man, I think you need to stop this.‚Äù Focusing on keeping his friend steady Rick missed the slight widening of Will‚Äôs eyes. 

‚ÄúN-no I-I got this.‚Äù Will tried to convince him but do to an untimely placed yawned it didn‚Äôt work. 

‚ÄúLook man, if it makes you feel better I‚Äôll stay up and watch you.‚Äù Rick tried to bargain slowly leading him to his bed. 

‚ÄúNo p-please don‚Äôt‚Äù Will pleaded once again yawned. Once he made it into bed it was game over and in 2 minutes he was asleep.¬†

To Rick's surprise it only took 20 minutes for Will to start moving. Seeing Will get out of bed he was about to wake him, but stopped remembering something about waking up sleep walkers and fear and anger. Not thinking about it more favoring watching the weirdly fascinating thing sleepwalking was. As they left the building Rick decided to undermine his best judgment and just followed WIll lead by curiosity and worry for his friend. Rick found himself starting to enjoy the night walk which added to his already clouded judgment. Going for around 2 and a half hours they entered into a forest, and Rick was confused because Will has never made it anywhere close to here. About ten more minutes of walking and Rick was about to call it quits and wake up Will, but spotted a clearing and reluctantly decided to keep going. With only the moon and stars as his light he made it into the clearing. As he took a step forward he felt a chill go up his spine and his heart started to speed up. Making it closer to the center, he noticed some dirt patches, then more and more. He noticed different sizes, some around the size of a skateboard‚Ä¶ and some the size of a‚Ä¶ human. His heart skipped a beat as he looked up and saw 30 of these patches. He then noticed the lack of another person. Quickly turning around‚Äì

Which is to say that I am a cishet male looking for a cis woman.

This is me in Professor Kukui cosplay plus a gym selfie if I did this thing right: https://imgur.com/a/qhxvjqo

About me: I am a librarian working in Texas but very open to moving away. I have no girlfriend, wife, or children to worry about, so I‚Äôm free to move wherever makes the most sense for me. I joke that there are three pillars to my personality: Pokemon, soccer, and ASOIAF. They are by far the things that I enjoy most but I have a lot of interests. Im a bit of a creative dilettante; I enjoy singing, acting, writing, composing, podcasting and have recently taken up drawing though I‚Äôm not very good at it. I speak English and Spanish fluently and am starting to move beyond ‚Äúelementary‚Äù level in French. I am also learning Irish and Japanese, but I am in absolute baby-language with those. I‚Äôm a big reader and lately I‚Äôve gotten into nonfiction science books, but I‚Äôm not above popular stuff. I relatively recently read the first ACOTAR book and Fourth Wing and liked both of them fine though I must admit I have basically no desire to keep reading them üòÖ. 

I am a vegetarian so I cook a bit bc I live in small town Texas lol. I love coffee and have a bit of an aesthetic eye so I really like fashion. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm like ‚Äúinto‚Äù fashion, but I dress well. But don‚Äôt get me wrong- I‚Äôm just as likely to wear a t-shirt and jeans lol. I really dig the 1950s and dark academia aesthetics in particular, but don‚Äôt get me wrong; I am very progressive.

I‚Äôm financially stable but I‚Äôm nowhere near being able to support you, though the kind of woman I‚Äôm looking for probably wouldn‚Äôt want me to support her anyhow. I‚Äôve lifted or am in the process of lifting myself out of generational poverty depending on how you define that. My mom is my hero; she came to the USA penniless and now helps train phlebotomists all across the country. It‚Äôs bc of her that I was able to make the most of my opportunities‚Ä¶ or at least some of them lol.

About you: I don‚Äôt know! I don‚Äôt like trying to dictate what the world around me looks like. Besides being a futile effort, I like the whimsy of finding out who is out there and might enjoy getting to know someone like me. Of course, I‚Äôd have to be attracted to you, you‚Äôd have to be attracted to me and we‚Äôd have to be compatible in all the adult ways- that‚Äôs non-negotiable, but if you are very different from me but still found this intriguing, I‚Äôd love to know why and get to know you as well. Maybe we‚Äôll hit it off, maybe one of us will ghost the other, maybe we‚Äôll like each other just fine but there‚Äôs no real chemistry. Whatever happens, I appreciate you reading my little stream of consciousness post and hope you find someone you enjoy.

I pried open the armoire and took a deep breath of the dusty air that plumed out. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I‚Äôd anticipated, no must or mold or strange minty residues. A piece with a bad smell always meant double the work. In the best cases it meant sanding, sealing, and painting. In the worst ones it meant carving out chunks of rotten wood and hours patching up the holes. A piece without a smell could be a beast too, but I could at least hope for an easy restoration. 



Most of the projects I‚Äôd taken on lately had been for-friend-favors and quick in-home touch-ups for past clients. It paid the bills, kept me from getting rusty. But this one was different. I found it on Craig‚Äôs List, scrolling one morning in between bites of brown sugar oatmeal and my second cup of coffee. The seller was moving and didn‚Äôt want to take it along, so they‚Äôd low-balled the price and offered to haul it for a small additional fee. I emailed them as soon as I finished reading the description. 



I probably shouldn‚Äôt have. The listing might as well have said DON‚ÄôT DO IT SHERI. I didn‚Äôt need a problem project or money pit or a distraction from the list of inquiries sitting in my inbox. From the first low quality picture I could tell that the armoire was all of those things. I could tell, but I bought it anyway.

Because it reminded me a little too much of her. 

Farrah knew a good piece when she saw one. I said that at her funeral, then left and cried in my car until the blood vessels around my eyes broke. It was true, though. While I was finding coffee tables and bookshelves, she was dragging in secretary desks and antique cradles. There were a couple of flubs here and there, of course. I never let her forget the time she lugged in an Ikea accent chair to reupholster or the hand carved bed frame she left at an estate sale. We laughed about that one all the time. It drove her crazy that she hadn‚Äôt gotten to fix it up. 



There was a rough spot on the inside of one of the doors. I pressed my thumbnail into it, checking to see if it had gone soft. It hadn‚Äôt. The wood was just old and needed a good sanding, maybe a double coat of varnish too. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted the finish to be yet. It depended on how I felt after I spent some time with it.



What I did know was that it needed to be sanded. A lot. I started to plug in the electric sander, a gift from Farrah a few birthday‚Äôs back, but opted to start by hand instead. I liked the repetitive sound of wood against coarse grit. As I started working on the rough spot, I let myself zone out to that sound. Zone out, and remember. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect,‚Äù Farrah traced the floral carvings on the front of the armoire, then looked back at me beaming, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 



I nodded and reached out to feel the carvings for myself. It was a beautiful piece, but where Farrah saw perfection, I was starting to see problems. The bottom edge was dinged up from years of collisions with vacuum cleaners and chair legs, there was a gooey blue stain in the bottom left corner, and it looked like at least a few nails had made their way into the back over the years. 



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I looked over at her, and she rolled her eyes. 



‚ÄúOh come on, look at it! It‚Äôs begging for a dark walnut stain and a shiny new coat of varnish.‚Äù 



She leaned over and linked her arm through mine, framing the armoire with her hand. The sunlight coming through the window illuminated every scratch and dent, and I almost pulled away to tell her I was putting my foot down. But the sunlight also caught the subtle gold on the handles. The swirling pattern of the grain. Her.



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I rapped my knuckles on the door, ‚ÄúBut we better make a killing on this thing.‚Äù 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



That armoire really was a money pit. It only took a few hours of work to realize that the wood grain and good bones weren‚Äôt enough to make it a worthwhile investment. But Farrah wasn‚Äôt going to admit that I was right, at least not out loud, and I wasn‚Äôt going to make her stop working on it. It was nice to have something unsaid to allude to when we were making decisions. All I had to do was glance over at it and she‚Äôd magically agree with me. Albeit with a groan and the occasional dirty look. I tried not to lord it over her too often.



A chunk of wood splintered off of the patch I was sanding, sending tiny rivulets jutting out into the surrounding wood. I debated for a second about whether to tack it back in or not. I decided to go for it. If anything else splintered I‚Äôd start going in with filler instead. My Gorilla Glue was almost empty. I had to shake it a couple times to get enough out. Wood glue and I didn‚Äôt get along, so it was almost never well stocked in the shop. I‚Äôd rather use filler and paint a piece than try and hobble together something natural looking.



I wiped the Gorilla Glue off my fingers. It didn‚Äôt look bad. I would just have to sand over that spot again later. Picking up where I left off, I continued to sand. Coarse grit. Rhythmic scrapes. Wood dust getting in my eyes because I didn‚Äôt wear goggles like I was supposed to. The hot, sweet smell of friction wafting up and covering the smell of the glue. Farrah didn‚Äôt like this part as much. She liked painting and staining. The long strokes of paint brushes and the globs of varnish falling onto the plastic sheeting between the can and whatever she was covering. Sanding took too long. There isn‚Äôt enough instant gratification. 



She bought me the electric sander for my birthday, and she told me that she knew I didn‚Äôt want it. I‚Äôd want it someday though, when I realized how much more fun this all was without the days of repetitive rubbing. 



The day I started using it, she looked over and tried to hide a smile. Sometimes when I caught her feeling self-righteous it made my blood boil. That time though, I just kept sanding and looking back at her. She did it everytime.



If she was there, I would have used it on my armoire too. I would have done anything she wanted.



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Farrah leaned against the unstained side of the armoire and knocked on the door I was working on. 



The hinges were loose. I was going to replace the screws, but the wood underneath was rotted out, replaced with a mixture of do-it-yourself remedies left behind by who knows how many decades of previous owners. 



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna have to paint it,‚Äù I tapped one of the holes, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way this thing isn‚Äôt going to be fifty percent filler by the time we‚Äôre done.‚Äù



‚ÄúThe doors and sides are fine,‚Äù She shrugged me off and went back to staining. We chose a dark cherry oak. I suggested something a little lighter, or at least more neutral, but she dug her heels in and insisted on cherry. Something about how wood looked red towards the last round of sanding so she thought that was the original color. 



It was her project, so I let her have it. Until I found the hinge rot. 



‚ÄúThe doors aren‚Äôt going to matter if they don‚Äôt have any hinges. I‚Äôm going to have to carve out most of the inner edge and replace it with filler and a new strip to anchor in the screws. That‚Äôs not going to look right stained.‚Äù



She came around and looked at what I was dealing with, ‚ÄúDo you think we could just move the hinges?‚Äù



‚ÄúDid you not hear a word I just said? The whole inner edge. Out. Why would we move the hinges if they‚Äôre just going to fall out again when the rest of the wood goes soft.‚Äù 



‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know the wood is going to go soft.‚Äù 



I looked back over at the rotten spots of wood and felt my jaw clench up. It was ridiculous. There was no way to keep the wood without giving up stability, and she knew that. We learned all that stuff together. She was being particular. And stupid. And stubborn.



Farrah reached over and pushed my shoulder, ‚ÄúHey, come on. Let‚Äôs just give it a go. I know that this thing is going to look fantastic if we do.‚Äù



‚ÄúFantastic,‚Äù I pushed her back, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt usually come to mind when I see wonky hinges.‚Äù 



Rolling her eyes, she handed me a paintbrush and gestured to the can of stain by her feet. 



‚ÄúWe can deal with the hinges later.‚Äù



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



I painted the armoire a week after she died. I shouldn‚Äôt have. It was only a couple more tweaks away from her vision. A coat of varnish. Refasten the legs. Fix the bottom drawer that squeaked when it closed. But I didn‚Äôt do any of that. I took a chisel and carved off the flowers, and I painted it matte navy. By the time I was done, it looked fresh off an Ashley show floor. Perfect. 



No other spots  splintered as I sanded. It looked like it might be hanging on a slant, but that I could fix. It was another story if the door was just uneven, but slanting just meant new hardware. New hinges, maybe. Or just hinges in a different spot. 



I stopped sanding and took a step back to look at the armoire. Everything looks ugly right when you start working on it. From a few back the spot I was working on looked like someone‚Äôs cat had gotten too it. Faded and dusty and scratched up. It was all part of the process. I knew that, but it still looked horrible. The kind of horrible that made me want to try one of those miracle primers and skip the sanding altogether. 



Miracle cures don‚Äôt work though. I knew that, too. Skipping steps and ignoring problems is poor craftsmanship. Paint peels off without a sanded base. 



Farrah would say that‚Äôs why painting should always be a last resort. Why would we paint anything if we were just going to have to worry about it peeling off or getting scuffed up? I tried to argue that stain and varnish get scuffed up too, but she was right. A scuff mark on wood made a piece look lived with. Scuff marks on paint looked trashy.



I could still smell the Gorilla Glue. Mixed with the wood shavings and leftover paint, it smelled like I was trying to bottle This Old House. We‚Äôd never gotten good ventilation in the shop without opening a door. It was a health hazard. I used enough paint stripper and ammonia to guarantee that. Someday I would look for a better space to rent. One with more windows and a garage door, maybe even tall ceilings I could mount a big fan to and guarantee circulation. 



Or I could just open the door and let in some fresh air. I opened and shut the doors on the armoire a few times, moving the air around my face. Farrah did that all the time. I used to get on her about how it would mess up the doors, but now that nobody was around to watch I did it too. It was fun. Especially with doors that already didn‚Äôt sit right. They clicked and strained just enough that I could feel it through the wood. I bet she‚Äôd let me have it if I ever admitted it to her.



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

	

‚ÄúCan you please loosen up,‚Äù Farrah straightened up from hunching over one of the armoire doors and shot me a glare.



‚ÄúCan you?‚Äù I snapped back. 



I was wrestling with the legs of a vanity that didn‚Äôt want to reattach to the body. The woman who owned it was coming by in twoin an hours to pick it up, and I still needed to reassemble it. Not to mention touch ups or a once over with some Pledge. Everyone likes the smell of lemon, our reviews proved that. Instead of worrying about the vanity, though, Farrah was on it about her armoire. 



We‚Äôd agreed to put it on the back burner until the real estate season calmed down. Everyone was moving and either wanted to get rid of their furniture or have it fixed up. It meant big bucks for us. Big bucks, and a lot of work. 



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Farrah went back to her door, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll loosen up.‚Äù 



I ignored her. 



She wanted to know what I thought of repairing one of the legs instead of replacing it. Something about if a vice or rubber bands would work better. She was leaning towards rubber bands so we could keep the vice open for other projects. I was leaning towards neither so we could focus on those other projects. 



One of the vanity legs finally clicked into place. I looked up to show Farrah, but decided to leave it alone. She was still hunched over. I could hear her muttering to herself as she worked sanding each carving. To her credit, she did ask me if I needed help before she started. But when I said no, I didn‚Äôt think that meant another three hours of armoire. 



I shifted to the other trouble leg and started to work it into it‚Äôs socket. This was a beautiful vanity. The drawers opened smooth as butter. The old stain and sealant didn‚Äôt peel off when I started sanding. Only the legs gave me any trouble. One of them was a quarter inch too short. The owner used a copy of The Velveteen Rabbit to keep it stable. None of her grandkids wanted her to read it to them, so it might as well get some use.



I told her she‚Äôd have to convince them otherwise, because we were going to get her vanity standing stable. 



‚ÄúDid you get one of them?‚Äù Farrah leaned over my shoulder, startling me back to the moment.



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I kept my eyes trained on the second leg. 



‚ÄúWas there a trick to it, or did you just have to wrench it in?‚Äù 



She was trying hard. I could tell. A minute or two of silence never failed to get her trying hard. She couldn‚Äôt stand it. Especially when we argued. If it were up to her we would argue ourselves in circles until we dropped dead and had to be buried in her armoire. I shoved down on the leg, grinding it a little farther into the socket. She walked back to the bench. 



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù 



I closed my eyes for a second, then looked back at her. 



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



Farrah died five months later. I never got around to Pledging the vanity. 



The armoire was going to be an easy restoration. I could poke and prod at it all I wanted, but it wasn‚Äôt going to make a rotten patch of wood appear or a mystery stain materialize. Anything that had looked like a red flag in the listing was just that. A flag. It would take me at most three days to get everything smoothed, stained, and ready to put back on Craigslist to sell at a reasonable markup. I didn‚Äôt even have to paint it. The wood was in perfect condition. 



I sold Farrah‚Äôs armoire for almost double what we bought it for. I tried to give it all to her mom, but she wouldn‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôd done all the work, she insisted, I should get the reward. I spent it all on new supplies. Cans of pale oak stain that I always ran out of. A new package of paint brushes and drop clothes. A selection of the earthy paints shades that everyone was doing their bedrooms in. And three cans of satin finish varnish. 



The armoire would look good in satin. I‚Äôd stain it a couple shades darker than the natural wood, then use up the last of the three cans to finish it off. It shouldn‚Äôt take more than two layers to get enough coverage. 



Farrah and I learned our lesson about overdoing it with the varnish on a crib right when we first started. By the time we were done, it looked more like a tiny coffin than anything a kid should sleep in. She joked about that everytime we worked on beds. Maybe we should shine it up and save people a couple thousand bucks. They sleep in it now, and be buried in it later. When people came to pick them up we had to pinch ourselves to keep our composure. Joking about bed-to-casket convertibles probably aren‚Äôt funny to people just trying to get grandma‚Äôs bed frame looking as good as it used to. 



I almost laughed when I saw her casket. It was embarrassing. But when I saw the glossy, cherry stained wood, I couldn‚Äôt not see that stupid crib. And that stupid armoire. Her mom came and put her arm around me when I hung back to get my composure. It must have looked like I was going to cry. But I didn‚Äôt. Not until I got out to my car. 



There was enough dust in the air to start irritating my nose. I could feel an evening of sniffles brewing just behind my eyes. If I really wanted to be done with the armoire in three days, I needed to finish sanding at least a door and a half. I opened and shut the doors again, sending a fresh wave of dust out into the air. 



Dust. Old paint. Gorilla Glue. The flowers I bought her. The ones I bought her mom. The ones her mom bought me. Varnish. Wood. Rotten wicker from a bassinet in the trash. The remnants of candles we shouldn‚Äôt have burned around all our chemicals. Stain. Perfume. Our sheets. My whole world.



I took a deep breath and went to turn off the light. Everything smells like her.

Big mistake. üòÖTurns out, your first scans are all about **building confidence** and learning the quirks of your scanner and software. Picking the right object can save a ton of frustration and give you results you‚Äôll actually be proud [of.Here](http://of.Here) are a few things I wish I‚Äôd known from the start:

1. **Material matters** Shiny, transparent, or really dark objects can be tricky‚Äîthey either reflect or absorb light differently, confusing the scanner. Start with something matte and evenly colored. Wood, unpainted ceramics, matte plastic, or lightly textured fabric work really well.
2. **Shape is surprisingly important** Smooth, featureless shapes like a plain mug or ball can actually be harder to scan because the software struggles to find reference points. You‚Äôll get better results with objects that have distinct edges, corners, or patterns‚Äîlike a small ornament, figurine, or textured household item.
3. **Size matters** Go for something roughly the size of a coffee mug up to a shoebox. Too small, and you lose detail; too large, and it‚Äôs harder to keep the scan aligned.
4. **Stability is key** Make sure your object can sit securely on a table or turntable. If it wobbles during scanning, your results will be messy.

**Good beginner objects:**

* A small wooden ornament or carved box
* A matte-finish action figure or toy
* A patterned ceramic plant pot
* A textured household tool (tape measure, stapler, etc.)

Start with these, get comfortable with your scanner, and soon you‚Äôll be ready to tackle more complex shapes.

Once upon a time, in my lively Italian class, a student bravely asked, ""What does *oltre* mean?"" Little did they know, they'd just opened a can of linguistic worms! Let's dive into the mystical world of *oltre* together, shall we? 

**The basics of *oltre***

In Italian, *oltre* means **""besides""** or **""other than.""** Picture this: you're at a caf√©, and the barista asks, ""Would you like anything else *oltre al* coffee?"" It's like asking if you want a sidekick to your espresso superhero.

**The grammar tango**

Now, here's where *oltre* gets fancy. It pairs up with **prepositions** like *al*, *alla*, *allo*, and so on, depending on the noun. Imagine a dance where *oltre* changes partners, swirling with words like *mio* (my) or *tua* (your). It's a grammar party!

**Real-life adventures with *oltre***

One of my students once exclaimed, ""I invited my friends *oltre ai* colleagues."" See how *oltre* adds that extra sprinkle of inclusivity? Or how about, ""I want to visit countries *oltre all‚Äô* India?"" It's like planning a world tour with *oltre* as your guide.

***Oltre* and verbs: A dynamic duo**

But wait, there's more! *Oltre* loves to hang out with verbs, too. Think of it as the Robin to Batman, linking phrases like ""What do you do on Sundays *oltre a dormire*?"" It's the ultimate sentence-completer, always needing a buddy to finish the thought.

So, dear Redditors, have you had your own *oltre* adventures? Share your stories, and let's keep the conversation rolling!

1nz44ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1nz44ni/everything_you_need_to_know/,EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW,"Hi everyone! I am heavily inspired by Erik from The Power of I Am (love him). This is basically a summary of everything I have learned from him.

First thing I want to say is. **THE 3D IS NEUTRAL.** The trees, the sky, SP, 3P, even your own body is the 3D. You do not have to 'fight it' or ignore it. If you know how reality works, you know the 3D is only showing you old awareness. Would you be upset reading a newspaper from 4 years ago? No. If the 3D can conjure an emotional reaction for you then it has power over you. If you become upset over what someone said or did to you then you see a hint of truth in that. Always remain **UNMOVED AND NEUTRAL.** If something good happens, good. If something bad happens, good. Be neutral.

Secondly, **GIVE EVERYTHING A GOOD MEANING.** Describe everything as if it was the way you would like it to be. Give it to yourself internally. See it in your mind's eye. Everything you give yourself in imagination is happening right now. You want to kiss your person? Go kiss them in your mind. The 3D will eventually materialize that. Your person is on dating apps? Has a new girlfriend? Great, those situations will help them realize that actually you are the only person for them. Let them be and see it done in your mind. 

We are **ALWAYS** on the bridge of incidents. Everything is unfolding perfectly for your manifestation. You have to trust in the unseen. This is the definition of manifestation. A lot of people believe that we don't need to take action. Hey, maybe you CAN wake up one day and look shredded. If that is your belief. In my personal experience, I have decided that I have the body of my dreams. This manifested in me naturally craving to go to the gym and choosing healthier eating habits. I don't feel like I am forcing myself to do anything, it feels very natural. 

**BELIEVE EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE IS THE RIGHT MOVE.** I don't care if you text your ex first. But ask yourself, who is the identity that is texting? Would you be completely unbothered if they didn't text you back for years? Then sure, text them. Every move you make is the right move. In the end, you know it is done. You have your manifestation. So, it doesn't matter. But if this will make you spiral, stalk them, waver, and be unstable then you are just taking action from a place of fear and lack. 

**THE SWEET SPOT.** Act as if you are in the state of the wish fulfilled. You feel a pep in your step. Your coffee should taste good all the time. Not just when you have your SP. Go to sleep feeling gratitude. That's what the version of you that has everything would be acting. Now, it is okay to experience sadness, anxiety, depression, etc. Feel those emotions and treat yourself like you would a close friend. But nonetheless...**DENY, CHOOSE, BE.** You can be sobbing in bed all day but still affirm and visualize that it is done. 

  
**STOP PEDESTALIZING SP.** They are no different then manifesting a bag of chips. They will not save you. They are just a regular person. And yes even 'celebrity' SPs. Please work on your self concept and concept of self. If you are robotically affirming all day but deep down believe that all men are trash and you always get abandoned then your results will not last long. 

Now de-pedestalizing them does not mean bring them down or talk badly about them in your mind. Stop fighting with them in your head! You are just being aware of a different version of them that has a right to exist. Infinite realities exist. You are just selecting the version of them you prefer. 

Imagine you have been in a relationship with them for 20 years. If they text you, bump into you, ask you on a date. Would you be getting this overly excited? No, it would just be normal for you. Make everything normal. And stop looking for 'signs'. You are just manifesting the signs and putting angel numbers and whatever else in your own awareness. Then being excited to see them. Manifesting an SP is the same as manifesting angel numbers. Manifesting anything is the exact same. 

**MENTAL DIET.** Take a break from your phone and social media if you need. Stop overly consuming manifesting content and trying to find 'the next best technique bro' (lol). Every time you click on a video that is titled, ""Get your SP in 30 Seconds"". You are not in the state of the wish fulfilled. It's so so so important to just be present. That is when things materialize. 

**WORRIED ABOUT TIME?** Linear time is not real. The past, present, and future are all happening right now. You are in the state of the wish fulfilled. Stop caring about time. If you deposited a million dollar check to the bank, it would take time for that big of a check to clear with the bank. But you know you already have the money. Even if you can't 'see' it. **Trust the unseen.**

**WHEN SP COMES BACK.** Why are you demanding a conversation about the past? Why do you need them to apologize? If you selected a new version of them, why are you entertaining a completely different version of them you don't want. You are still focused on the old story and getting angry that they are reflecting that awareness. They are just reflecting you! If you are in a happy relationship with them, you would not be aware that you need to be apologized to or confront something that happened. Stop looking to the 3D for validation. IT WILL NEVER VALIDATE YOU. There is nothing outside of you. You are all there is. Stop giving your power away. ",7,1759708713.0,lawofassumption,4,1.0,False

i used to reread notes endlessly and still forget half of it the next day. what really clicked was mixing active recall with visuals. like, instead of just writing terms, i started making flashcards with images, literally just dragging in photos, anatomy diagrams, or graphs and pairing them with short answers. seeing the image and recalling the term (or vice versa) made stuff stick way faster. i use blekota for this since it lets you drop in an image and it turns into a quiz question automatically, which saves a ton of time before exams.

outside of that i keep my study blocks short (40‚Äì50 min), always review before bed (quick pass through flashcards), and once a week i ‚Äúteach‚Äù the material to an imaginary class lol. sounds dumb but explaining forces me to actually *know* it.

This may sound ridiculous but I‚Äôm giving it one last effort to see if the universe has my back. Today I lost my favorite long sleeve button-down plaid flannel, likely on the walk from South Station over to the 115 Purchase St parking garage at the corner of High st and Purchase St, around 4pm today Sunday Oct 5th.

I attached a picture of the shirt, I believe it‚Äôs goodfellow brand, but they don‚Äôt make it anymore! It fits me perfectly, is butter soft, and I‚Äôm kicking myself.

I had it double knotted to my backpack on a bus ride from NYC, and stopped outside South Station to get my stuff re-assembled before heading to the car. I did have to stop and double back at one point to ask security to assist someone having a medical crisis, but then crossed Atlantic st over to Purchase, and then took a block over to High St to get out of the sun. I walked High St down to Pearl; then took Pearl st back to Purchase and entered the garage. 

I‚Äôve already put in lost and found reports with the bus company, the mbta, and the parking garage, just to cover my bases. But here I am, hoping someone picked it up and turned it in somewhere. ü§¶üèº

Thanks for reading this, I just really love this dang shirt. Also if any dedicated internet sleuths can find a link to a replacement, I‚Äôll get you a coffee with my gratitude. üôèüèª

I only want those who truly mattered, the ones who walked with me through my darkest hours, who stood by me when the world felt heavy. Those are the souls I want gathered.

I don‚Äôt want an open casket or a traditional viewing. No. I want a celebration of my life,  a space filled with warmth, honesty, and stories. Speak of the strangest, funniest, and most unexpected moments we shared. Remember how our paths crossing shifted the way we saw ourselves and the world. I don‚Äôt want tears or sorrow to fill the room! I want laughter, loud, unrestrained, and contagious. The same kind of laughter that defined me. Let my memory live in the joy of your voices, not the weight of your grief.

When the celebration has ended, please cremate me and grant me this one last wish. I was raised in the countryside,  my childhood spent high up in trees, swinging from branch to branch, feeling the wind and the earth as my home. I have always been a free spirit, and nature has always been where my soul found peace.

Take part of my ashes to the ocean, the place where I went so many times to cleanse my energy and ground myself. Let me reunite with Mother Nature and become part of the waves that once calmed my anxious heart and washed away my worries.

With another part of my ashes, plant a tree in the backyard. Mix me with the soil and fertilizer so I may grow with it, becoming one with its roots and branches. Place a bench nearby, so you can sit in the mornings with your coffee, share your stories, and tell me about the day before. Under that tree‚Äôs shade, I‚Äôll still be with you, a part of your life, offering comfort, peace, and a quiet place for you to come and talk to me whenever you need to feel my presence.

Apartment #1 is luxury luxury. And Im not saying its the apartment that uses it as a marketing scheme. The place has 2 hot tubs and heated pool, its own coffee shop, smells of eucalyptus with 24 hour concierge and free dry cleaning services. It is super chic and has a hotel feel. BUT the apartment unit is just  okay, has the bare minimum and I cant open the windows more than a tiny crack. Its a skyrise, but I was hoping I would have a balcony (not an option) or ability to get some sort of fresh air. The location is also not as ideal, just okay. I still have great use of public transportation (I dont have a car), would be a 10 min bus commute but it does have a homeless issue around the building like any downtown city. However I feel super safe once IN the building. Not having fresh air is giving me claustrophobic concerns.

Apartment #2 is in an apartment that has just... okay amenities. No hot tub, does have a heated pool and fire pits though. Its pretty far to get around inside and is a bit of a maze. Still has safety though! Fob entry and fob use for elevators. The location is great and literally an 8 minute walk from my work, and is on top of a Kroger with private tenant access (This is GREAT for not having a car.) The hallways are just okay, no luxury feel. But the APARTMENT. It is huge, has real hardwood floors, and is perfect. It wowed me and has such charming personality rather than the standard landlord feel. It also has a tiny balcony and all windows open even though im on the top floor. Its also located across the street from union station so I would have access to anywhere in the city.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


You‚Äôll never hear this in a church basement over stale coffee and cigarette smoke, but the sacred text of Alcoholics Anonymous was written on a bed drenched in psychedelic sweat. Bill Wilson, the patron saint of the twelve-step, didn‚Äôt find God in a pew; he found Him in a poison-trip delirium at Towns Hospital in New York, riding the Belladonna Cure‚Äîa brutal cocktail of nightshade and mercury administered every hour on the hour for fifty straight hours. Let me repeat that: fifty hours. The man was essentially force-fed a medieval witch‚Äôs brew until the walls melted and God showed up as a blinding white light. Yes, the Big Book‚Äôs foundational spiritual awakening was brought to you by a high-pressure salesman named Towns, who owned the hospital that treated Bill for alcoholism. He claimed he got the shamanic recipe from some anonymous ‚Äúcountry doctor‚Äù‚Äîwhich is code for either an enlightened medicine man or a homeless guy who really knew his fungi. Either way, Bill W. was absolutely orbiting the planet when he decided to save the world from the bottle.

This was the 1930s, and the Western world was having a collective nervous breakdown. The occult was all the rage with the intellectual elite, a kind of spiritual panic-buying as the British Empire‚Äôs collapse brought back exotic beliefs from the East like souvenirs. Bill dove headfirst into this scene. We‚Äôre talking seances, channeling, the whole spook-show. He was also corresponding with occultist and psychologist Carl Jung, who‚Äôd already decided that alcoholism was a ""spiritual thirst‚Äù and that only a full-blown mystical experience could cure it. Jung was neck-deep in the Oxford Group, a secretive society obsessed with cracking the code of the Templars‚Äô lost spiritual tech‚Äîthe real ‚ÄúHoly Grail,‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt a literal cup but a method: Il Graduale, a step-by-step guide to enlightenment the Catholic Church tried to erase.

So Bill takes this template, this esoteric, alchemical ladder meant to turn the lead of human suffering into the gold of enlightenment, and he simplifies it into the Twelve Steps. It was supposed to be a liberating ascent. But somewhere between the mystical origins and the church basements, the gold turned back into lead. The program that was meant to expand consciousness became a factory for shrinking it. Independent thought was swapped out for thought-terminating clich√©s: ‚ÄúLet go and let God,‚Äù ‚ÄúFake it till you make it,‚Äù ‚ÄúYour best thinking got you here.‚Äù The quest for the Grail became a surrender to groupthink. The pineal gland‚Äôs antenna to the divine was swapped for a lifetime of nicotine and discount donuts.

Bill knew it was failing. He knew most people weren‚Äôt having these profound awakenings. So in the 1950s, he went back to the well (the chemical well). He started experimenting with LSD, hoping it could kickstart the mystical experience for ‚Äúcynical alcoholics‚Äù who couldn‚Äôt get there with coffee and confession. He even treated other members himself. He saw it as a tool, a shortcut back to that Belladonna-grade revelation. But the organization he built had already hardened into a dogma. They looked at their founder, seeing God on acid, and sneered: ‚ÄúBill takes one pill to see God, and another to quiet his nerves.‚Äù

And so AA‚Äôs origin story became the oldest story in the book: a beautiful, dangerous, alchemical truth gets sanded down, sanitized, and sold back to the masses as a lifeline. What began as a wild-eyed quest for God in the psychedelic poison became a program that often feels less like freedom and more like a softly-spoken cage. The seeker‚Äôs journey became a sinner‚Äôs script. Thanks anyway, Bill. We see what you were going for. It‚Äôs a shame the cure for the disease became a symptom of the same sickness.

How the AA Method Works: 
A User‚Äôs Guide to Divine Surrender

The AA process, at its origin, wasn‚Äôt just about quitting the bottle. It was an alchemical biohack‚Äîa forced pathway to spiritual awakening disguised as recovery. It‚Äôs a system engineered to do one thing: elevate your kundalini (dormant spiritual energy) and resurrect the divine light within. In rare, but documented cases, this leads to what‚Äôs been called spiritual awakening, the Christos alchemical rebirth‚Äîthe descent of the Holy Spirit, the quest for the Holy Grail. Today it's commonly known as pineal gland activation. 

Its roots dig deep into the ancient mystery schools of the Greeks and Egyptians and lead all the way to the current day Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons, their common traditions encoded in myth, architecture, and symbol for millennia. And while many occult & esoteric mystery school paths lead to the same enlightenment, they all begin the same way: surrender.

You can approach this awakening through three main doors: love, devotion, or madness. You surrender your rational mind to a person, to a set of beliefs & traditions, or to sanity itself. AA chooses devotion to a set of beliefs & traditions. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you worship‚Äîa doorknob, Shiva, JC, a tree, the group itself, anything but your own miserable, bankrupt ego‚Äîso long as you bend the knee to something other than yourself. This act of submission is the first, crucial step. It‚Äôs about switching off the rational mind, that arrogant, yapping manager in your skull that thinks it‚Äôs in charge.

Think of a dog walking through a city. They look up at a skyscraper, trying to understand it. They can‚Äôt. They don't have the cognitive ability to comprehend human engineering, and they're colorblind to the neon signs we see blazing. Where we see a bright red ‚ÄúOPEN‚Äù sign, the dog sees a dull, gray slab. Their dog brain just cannot process the engineering of a higher species. Now scale that up: You are that dog, trying to grasp divine engineering. God‚Äîor the architecture of the universe, your subconscious, whatever you want to call it‚Äîis the city. Your rational mind is not just useless here; it‚Äôs a liability. It‚Äôs barking at vacuums. 

This is likely why the Bible hammers on-and-on about fear. The most frequently repeated commandment in the Bible is ‚ÄúFear not‚Äù which appears 365 times‚Äîone for every day of the year. It‚Äôs not a suggestion; it‚Äôs a prescription. Your amygdala, that ancient lizard-brain panic button, is the primary obstacle to spiritual progress. You wouldn‚Äôt perform open-heart surgery on yourself while wide awake, would you? So why would you want to stare, fully conscious and rational, into the exposed, corrupted mess of your own soul? To encounter the divine raw would shatter most people. Permanent psychosis, lost forever in the labyrinth of their subconscious.

Enter the sponsor. This isn‚Äôt some cheerful buddy; this is your guide through the underworld. Your guru of the gutters. Their job is to hold the tennis ball‚Äîto distract you while God runs the vacuum cleaner in your brain. You are not meant to do this alone. To stare into the abyss without a guide is to risk falling in‚Äîforever. The sponsor is the voice that says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look directly at that white light yet. Look at me. Read this step. Call me instead of taking a drink.‚Äù They are the human shield between your fragile, flickering consciousness and the blinding, annihilating light of truth. You learn to trust the process by learning to trust them. And through that trust, you build the courage to eventually trust something even Bigger.

This is where AA‚Äôs genius (or its occult rigor) truly shines. It forces you to confront your deepest, most ubiquitous fears: public speaking, confession, radical honesty. These are not moral exercises; they are neurological drills. Shadow work. Amygdala reps. Every time you stand in a room of strangers and say, ‚ÄúMy name is ______, and I am an alcoholic,‚Äù you are doing soul-work. You are sanding down your own ego, fear, and dishonesty through sheer, brutal repetition.

And this is where esoteric Christianity‚Äôs core tenet ‚Äòradical acceptance‚Äô becomes the ultimate neuro-hack. ‚ÄúTurn the other cheek‚Äù isn‚Äôt about being a doormat, or finger-waving moral advice; it‚Äôs about overriding a million years of evolutionary wiring for retaliation. It‚Äôs consciously quieting the limbic system‚Äôs scream for justice. When you can face the worst possible scenario‚Äîtotal humiliation, failure, death‚Äîand breathe through it, you initiate a profound shift in your nervous system. It's the neurological mechanism behind most esoteric/occult spiritual practices meant to raise the kundalini, including modern day Bikram Yoga. 

Radical acceptance and amygdala training clears blocked chakras. You open energetic channels. You allow the microtubules within your neurons‚Äîthe very structures theorized to facilitate quantum coherence in the brain‚Äîto relax from a state of defensive rigidity. It is in this state of coherence, some propose, that consciousness fully enters the body; that the wave function of potential experience collapses from possibility into being. But when the amygdala is engaged‚Äîwhen you are trapped in fight-or-flight‚Äîthose microtubules constrict. You become a reactive puppet, severed from source, trapped in the illusion of separateness.

This amygdala training, this rewiring of fear, combined with somatic practices like semen retention (a classic occult method for conserving and transmuting vital energy), forms the bedrock of initiating a kundalini awakening. It‚Äôs why these methods are often concealed. We‚Äôve all heard about Gandhi testing his restraint by sleeping beside naked young women. This work goes further (stranger, more extreme) than anyone basking in the ‚Äúpink cloud‚Äù of early sobriety could possibly imagine. Hey, nobody said it was easy. 

Finally, there is community service, aka karma yoga for the broken. This isn‚Äôt about being a good person. It‚Äôs about energy maintenance. As the kundalini fire begins to rise, the system must remain in balance. Selfless service grounds the energy. It prevents you from blowing a fuse and ending up another enlightened lunatic shouting at pigeons (or barking at dogs) in the park. It connects you to something larger than your own awakening, ensuring the current doesn‚Äôt consume the wire.

So no, AA isn‚Äôt just about not drinking. It‚Äôs a factory for saints and madmen. It‚Äôs a boot camp for the soul, using fear as a whetstone to sharpen the spirit. You come for the sobriety. You stay for the awakening. And if you do it right‚Äîwith a guide who knows the path‚Äîyou leave fearing nothing at all.

 





12 Steps 2.0: A Modern Templar Framework for Liberation from Addiction & Compulsive Consumption

Recovery as Counterinsurgency in the 5th Generation of Warfare for your Mind, Body, & Soul

Premise:

Addiction is not a moral weakness or personal failure‚Äîit‚Äôs a systemic one. The myth of a ‚Äòchemical imbalance‚Äô is a victim blaming tactic that obscures reality: we‚Äôve been programmed, poisoned, and preyed upon by bad actors since birth. Real recovery requires rewiring, not repentance. We may be bruised in battle, but we will win the war.

Step 0: We Admitted We Were Under Siege

Before surrender came tactical awareness. We recognized that our minds, bodies, and spirits had been colonized by the evil empires of distraction, depletion, and dependency. This was not by accident‚Äîit was a cleverly disguised ambush attack by a superior army. Eventually we came to a point in our battles where it was necessary to declare a strategic withdrawal, so we could save our lives and fight another day.

Step 1. We Waved the White Flag of Our Ego

We surrendered to our own ignorance, recognizing that our inner world and dysfunction had become unmanageable. We admitted that our mental faculties had been hacked by formidable forces‚Äî Big Pharma, Big Food, Big Tech, and institutional narratives that brainwashed us into adopting self-destructive coping mechanisms of over consumption. Our 'powerlessness' was engineered by a psychopathic system that burns the capitalist-candle at both ends, so they can profit from our gluttony and the ensuing illness it causes. They designed our dis-ease so they could cash-in on the cure, but we refuse to be remedied by the same machine that broke us. We realized that no one is coming to save us but ourselves. So we began our counterattack.

Step 2. The Neurochemical Reboot

Following in the footsteps of AA founder Bill Wilson‚Äôs alchemical journey, we initiated a neural reset: a medically supervised, therapeutic ‚Äòmacro-dose‚Äô of plant psychedelics (ibogaine, psilocybin, or ayahuasca) to dissolve the addictive loops and delete the malware. We buried our old selves ceremonially.

Step 3. The Shadow Integration:

Here, with a guide, we entered the cave. With courage, we turned inward to confront our Shadow‚Äîthe disowned parts of ourselves that the addiction masked. We conducted a searching and fearless moral inventory of our transgressions, resentments, and fears. We did this not for self-flagellation, but for reconnaissance, because to know the enemy within is to disarm it. We did this without excessive rumination and we kept the therapy-industrial complex out of it. Their goal is incurable consumers, not healed warriors.

Step 4. The 90-Day Mitochondrial Crusade

Toxins out, energy up. Fasting, ketogenic nutrition, cold exposure, therapeutic lipids, and infrared sauna became our weapons. We starved the parasites‚Äîliteral and metaphorical‚Äîand reclaimed our cellular sovereignty.

Step 5. The Tribe Transformation

We exited enabler ecosystems, sought those who challenged us, and connected with an ‚Äòinner guide‚Äô or ‚Äòsource of wisdom‚Äô in the form of a recovery sponsor or spiritual guru. No more complaining to our comfort-cult. We built a circle of trusted warriors who sharpened one another 

Step 6. Daily Gratitude and Fear Extinction

We weaponized mindfulness. Through yoga, Wim Hof breathwork, and somatic practices, we recalibrated our amygdala‚Äîrewiring terror into tenacity. We audited our blessings daily, realizing the only way to have enough is to want much less. We shed the skin of programmed consumption and became creators, not captive customers‚Äîfueled by intuition, beauty, and nature - not inertia, indoor misery, and gluttony.

Step 7. Claiming the Courageous Archetype

We studied the laws of nature, the alchemical symbology of transformation, and the sacred myths that mirrored our struggle (Pinocchio, Osiris, Jonah, Odysseus, Dionysus, etc). We imprinted these symbols, story plots, and hero archetypes into our subconscious until the hero‚Äôs journey transformation became instinct. 

Step 8. Engineering Our Hero‚Äôs Journey

We confessed our worst transgressions in a rebirth ritual, then never spoke of them again, because rumination is the foe of joy. We spoke openly and honestly about our personal defects, and listened to other addicts share their recovery stories so we could gain deeper insight into how the disorder of addiction manifests in our own lives. We broke the cycles of victimhood, stopped begging others for their permission, and chose action over crybaby catharsis. Inner-engineering and future-self visualization became our compasses: we met the liberated version of ourselves and followed their map.

Step 9. Biohacking the Reward Regimen

We replaced cheap dopamine hits with earned peaks: flow states, mastery, and real-world wins. Service to others became our highest currency‚Äî guiding those still trapped in addiction, the holy grail.

Step 10. Spiritual Shielding

We adopted a daily meditative or spiritual practice‚Äînot as escapism, but as tactical training for the mind, and a way to balance our energetic bodies.

Step 11. Antifragile Conditioning

We trained like our lives depended on it (because they do). Healthy stress became our ally‚Äî weights, fasting, and cognitive challenges forged resilience.

Step 12. Burn the Blueprint & Carry the Message Forward

We rejected cookie-cutter recovery, recognizing that everyone takes a different path. We internalized the main Jungian principles of shadow integration, subconscious archetype programming, and participation mystique, then burned the specific blueprint. We carried the message forward to struggling addicts, and pledged to update our methods with (real) breakthroughs addiction / shamanic sciences. This is an initial prototype, not a dogma. We evolve or repeat.  

The Templar Oath

""I will not kneel to the systems that broke me.
I will weaponize my healing, protect those still trapped, and reclaim my sovereignty‚Äîby any means necessary.‚Äù

Apartment #1 is luxury luxury. And Im not saying its the apartment that uses it as a marketing scheme. The place has 2 hot tubs and heated pool, its own coffee shop, smells of eucalyptus with 24 hour concierge and free dry cleaning services. It is super chic and has a hotel feel. BUT the apartment unit is just  okay, has the bare minimum other than the fact I cant open the windows more than a tiny crack. Its a skyrise, but I was hoping I would have a balcony (not an option) or ability to get some sort of fresh air. The location is also not as ideal. I still have great use of public transportation (I dont have a car), would be a 10 min bus commute but it does have a homeless issue around the building like any downtown city. However I feel super safe once IN the building. Not having fresh air is giving me claustrophobic feelings. 

Apartment #2 is in an apartment that has just... okay amenities. No hot tub, does have a heated pool and fire pits. Its pretty far to get around inside and is a bit of a maze. Still has safety though! Fob entry and fob use for elevators. The location is great and literally an 8 minute walk from my work, and is on top of a Kroger with private tenant access (THIS IS GREAT for not having a car.) The hallways are just okay, no luxury feel. But the APARTMENT. It is huge, has real hardwood floors, and is perfect. It wowed me and has such charming personality rather than the standard landlord feel. It also has a tiny balcony and all windows open even though im on the top floor.

But I kept telling myself ‚Äî¬†*‚ÄúJust finish strong. You‚Äôve got Peace of Mind coverage, so give it everything.‚Äù*

I froze. My hands literally started shaking. I rechecked my name twice before it sank in ‚Äî it was real. That moment will stay with me forever.

**1- Preparation Timeline**: 3.5 months¬†of focused study ‚Äî mostly early mornings, weekends, and travel breaks. It‚Äôs not about hours; it‚Äôs about showing up every single day, even when your brain says,¬†*‚ÄúEnough of CIA triad already.‚Äù*

* **Destination Certification Book** ‚Äì Great visuals and structure; helped connect the dots faster.
* **(ISC)¬≤ Official Study Guide, 10th Ed.**¬†‚Äì My main deep-dive source.
* **Peter Zerger‚Äôs CISSP Cram**¬†‚Äì Clear, calm explanations.
* **Andrew Ramdayal 50 Questions**‚Äì Excellent for building the right mindset.
* **Prabha Nair‚Äôs Coffee Shots**¬†‚Äì Short, sharp recaps; great for last-week refreshers.
* **QE** practice sets ‚Äì They forced me to slow down, read carefully, and reason through the logic behind each option.
* **Official Practice Tests** (Sybex) ‚Äì Ideal for concepts clarity.
* **Prashant Mohan‚Äôs Memory Palace**¬†‚Äì Good for quick visual recall.

**3- Exam Experience:**

Amanda and I both moved to our current city at the same time. Young couples with a small child trying to find friends in a new environment where we knew no one. We met a few months into our move over coffee and hit it off beautifully.  She had a 1 year old son and I had a six month son. We were in the same phase of life , seemed to have similar values, newely SAHM's, house hunting in this new place with no real support system. We just gravitated toward each other. She was my rock through nagivating failed mom SAHM's groups and trying to find my place in this community she was always my person. It was great. Over the next 3 years our families did everything together.  It seemed like our family's became best friends. We played in a fantasy football league together, have dinner together, I have watched her children for her during doctors appointments. This truly was the first friendship in my life that I felt like this person was like my sibling...her kids were my kids...over the 3 year friendship we both had our second babies around same time and then I added 1 more soon after. I always joked that my second 2 kids had a built in best friend because the boys were so close. The friendship was pretty solid and easy going. We started traditions like trunk or treats, apple picking, peach picking, sport events etc that we are on our 4th year together as families doing..or we were. My friend Amanda just found out she is having her 3rd baby and thought since are other 2 kids were covid babies let's throw here a cute baby shower. I am friends with her mom and together her mom and I planned this adorable baby shower at a fancy brunch place and I just need to organize a few final touches. Invites are out and about 14 women will be there. Should be adorable and was originally such am honor to throw. 

That brings me to now. About 6 months ago I introduced my bestfriend (amanda) to another friend I met in a moms group...let's call her Kerry. Kerry also had 2 boys abound the same age as our older 2 and they all seemed to play great together. I started including Kerry in our outings and playdates and thought we were all jiving really well and having a good time. About 3 months into our new little friendship Amanda told me her son was not going to play soccer anymore. Now our 2 boys have played the last 2 years together. They are now 4 and 4.5 years old. I was supper bummed because my son loves playing with hers but I understand. She told me they were going to play baseball with Kerry's son. I thought that was great! We are a big sports family but my son just committed to ice skating so although we were sad to not be able to join them (we were invited)we unfortunately could not take on another activity and said have fun and let us know what you think about the program. I honestly didn't think much if it. This unfortunately is where things went south for our friendship.  

Over the last 3 months the friendship seemed to become cold. Our families never hung out on the weekend anymore but Kerry and Amanda seemed to always be together. I saw them every 2 weeks on our typical Friday play dates and we would plan get together for the future.  We had a family camping trip planned, Thomas the train day trip and a zoo day trip we were trying to work out. I thought we were talking and planning about these thing as a collective but I started to see i was an after though.  Amanda and I went from seeing eachother 2 times a week to me seeing her every other week in a group setting with Kerry.. Her and Kerry planned a zoo day trip...the one i thought we were doing as a group...they planned this a day my daughter has dance(only day in the week we cant go, and a day they had to take kids out of preschool) and invited me 2 hours before to let me know they were going.  I think maybe to save face because they obviously had planned this for a bit. At this point my feeling are hurt. I tried to ignore it thinking I am overthinking it or in my head. So our Thomas visit comes up...Amanda and Kerry disappeared together with their kids for about an hour. I took my kids to do an activity that they were not interested in so I said I would meet them after...no biggie right....we'll in hour later they both come back and decided that they actually wanted to do the activities and even though we were done we waited for them so we could stay together. ...I feel like now is the point I should have felt like I was maybe kinda an outcast.  

Now we finally get to the main drama of the story. Our camping trip. We had planned this camping trip for about 4 months. All 3 of our families. Kerry made a little sheet that outlined what our families should bring. I followed it to a t. My family was suppose to bring a grill, propane, breakfast food and then our individual camping stuff. They each had their owen list. We made a little group chat and i was getting excited about going. The few days before the chat was quite but I thought all was organized so I again didn't think anything of it. The day before I am asked about the grill surface because they need to cook tacos ( I thought we were doing burgers the 2 days) they laughed and said oh yeah we planned tacos but we dont all have to eat the same thing so no worries. This was only communication really before and i just said okay excited to see yall. Next day we were behind because 3 kinds packing under 4 is just a crazy task. We were about 2 hours behind them to the camp site. They had a little compound set already with obviously matching camping stuff when we got there. My husband unloaded the grill so they could all work on dinner and I set up toys for our kids and worked on tent. We made dinner got kids ready for bed, had a few drinks with everyone and everyone went to bed. My family and I were excited about the next few days events. 

The first morning of the trip the vibe was very apparent that we were not wanted. Amanda and Kerrys families started working on breakfast.  No one spoke to us. I started getting our cooler unloaded as my task was to bring breakfast food. I was met with a ""oh dont worry about it we brought ours.""  The other 2 families started making food for themselves.....it took me longer than I want to admit to realize we were not included in that. I now was pretty confused as i went to my husband to start our grill so we can make food for our kids/us as they are not including us in what they have going on and actually brought their own griddle and had a shared food tub. It was a very awkward moment. Trying to not ruin a 4 year friendship and not get in my head I blow it off. Maybe it was a miss communication when planning, maybe I am being sensitive, I tell myself let's just push through and see what happens.  I started washing and cleaning everyone's dishes to help and get site cleaned up as we all have tickets to go apple picking. I mind you cleaned up everyones breakfast mess by myself (my husband was dressing our kids fornthe day) We'll before I could finish cleaning Amanda and Kerry's families are in their cars, no good by and driving to apple picking. I panick and start to rush to finish cleaning, get trash in dumpster get our 3 kids in car and get on our way. We get to apple picking for them to not wait for us but to have already ordered doughnuts for their kids (we were 15 min behind) and have given away the table while I stood on line to ordered for my kids. I come back with my kids to see they were already at the Map and have moved on so I rush my kids into our wagon stroller to have drinks and catch up.  Mind you this is suppose to be the 4th year our families have gone with Amanda and now we were being treated like strangers or an inconvenience.  Years passed our kids order food together we take pictures , its much more chill. After chasing them around for about an hour around the orchard we stopped trying to easy drop and be included. They seem to be actively walking away and taking pictures without us. I no longer was interested inntrying to figure out next the move. They left as families and planned a lunch stopped that we were not included in on or invited to. At this point we found them talking in a group at theblarking lot and stated we were just going back to camp site to eat lunch as originally planned. They shrugged and said see yall later and we left. 

We get to our campsite. We packed up all our things and left 2 nights early without a word. I got a group text from Amanda and Kerry about 3 hours later asking where we were, and that was it. I had no response to give as I was shocked and pretty shaken up honestly. I cried in the car ride home. After hundreds of dollars to go camping with what I thought were my best friends and to be treated like I am invisible was so heartbreaking. I truly feel like a fool. I honestly have no idea why people would be so cruel. I have tried to reflect on if I may have said or did something, and i just dont know what it could be.  I may need to just come to terms with maybe I valued the friendship differently than Amanda did.  

So that brings me to now. I am obviously not going to throw this person a baby shower. Our kids won't be hanging out again. i plan to 100 percent cut all my ties. I dont see a need for interactions. Her mom was co-hosting the baby shower with me and has paid the deposit on the room. Thankfully, im not out much money. I will be sending her mom a message today stating i unfortunately can no longer commit to helping financially or with planning. I will send an updated rsvp list and add some new blocks to my phone.

Right now, I use a 1Zpresso JX (non-pro) grinder, which I‚Äôve been happy with. Unfortunately, the handle has taken one too many drops and the small plastic circle finally shattered. I‚Äôve sanded it down so it‚Äôs safe to use and rigged up a heavy paper towel to replace the broken ‚Äúshield,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not a long-term solution.

Since I sometimes serve coffee at concession stands during sporting events where I prepare larger batches ahead of time (Chemex) I‚Äôm considering moving to an electric grinder. While I value the control of a manual grinder, an electric option might be more practical for these situations.

As I live in a somewhat remote area, shipping and returns can be a hassle, so I‚Äôd rather not waste time trial-and-erroring with different grinders. I‚Äôm currently deciding between simply buying another manual grinder, or pairing one with an electric like the Fellow Ode Gen 2 fitted with SSP burrs (though I‚Äôve heard there might be other aftermarket burrs, possibly from a Korean company, worth considering maybe?).

My main priorities are:

* **Low noise** (I also own a Baratza, and it's a noisemaker....ahhh tinnitus is no joke)
* **Low fines**, especially when brewing African beans
* **Clarity in flavor**, since I‚Äôm known locally for being pretty hard-nosed about my coffee standards

I‚Äôm not trying to grow my micro-hustle, but I do want to maintain a reputation for quality. With that in mind, what should I be considering in my next grinder setup? Also, what vacuum canisters do you guys have experience with? Do cheaper ones from Ali Express hold up? I'm ordering some from Ode until I can get cheaper ones to add to those, since I can benefit from freezing my beans between orders. ",1,1759707560.0,pourover,0,0.67,False
1nz3pi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoingToSpain/comments/1nz3pi6/my_study_abroad_weekend_in_madrid_spain/,"My Study Abroad Weekend in Madrid, Spain!","Hi all! At the end of March, I met up with my family who was visiting Europe while I was studying abroad in Belgium. We met up in Madrid for the weekend, and had an amazing time which I thought I'd share! My boyfriend and our other American family friends also joined in on the fun, making it a super meaningful weekend. My mom is as fluent as you can be in Spanish without being a native speaker and has many friends from Madrid, so it has always been a happy place for us.

I landed in MAD early Friday morning, and met up with my family in the airport. We took a cab to our friend's apartment where we were keeping our bags, who also rents it out at as an Airbnb for months at a time, while he spends his time in Paris. We walked around Plaza del Sol, and stopped at a local cafe for some tortilla espanola and coffee. Spanish omelettes are one of my favorite foods, something we have been remaking a lot for breakfast here in the states.

We were finally able to check into our own Airbnb in the afternoon on la Calle de Santiago. We got settled, then headed out to meet some other family friends to tapear! Easily one of my favorite parts of the weekend. It was fully 1pm which is something I was not used to haha, but so much fun. We popped around local bars in La Latina and Malasa√±a neighborhoods. I had never been to this part of the city before and had a wonderful experience.

After a long afternoon, my boyfriend and I headed to shop! Shopping and window shopping is one of my favorite things to do, especially in Europe. Touristy I know, but we walked down Gran V√≠a. Scalpers had some great things, something I don't think we have in the US! For dinner, we went to Ten con Ten in the Salamanca neighborhood. Amazing!! The vegetables and truffle risotto are a must. I have heard it is a little overrated, but we had an incredible experience and the service was great. Afterwards, we saw a flamenco show which my mom commented is not authentic to Madrid, although the show and atmosphere was great. My goal is to visit the south of Spain to see an authentic flamenco performance!  Lmk if u have any recs for authentic flamenco in Andaluc√≠a.

On our second morning, we met up with family friends who had never been to Madrid, so we wanted to give them a comprehensive experience. We went to San Gin√©s for some churros, which were delicious as per usual. We took them to the Royal Palace, Plaza del Sol, and Parque de Retiro. We were hoping to get a boat in the park, so definitely try and book in advance as the line was super long. I believe you can do this on the Madrid Movil app. For dinner, we visited Frida in the Justicia neighborhood. Casual and contemporary atmosphere perfect for catching up with our friends! We ordered traditional tapas, and the croquettas were my favorite!

I feel like there is never enough time in Madrid! This was my second time, and I still have so much more to see. I know I have hit most of the ""touristy"" spots, but I still cannot get enough of the Spanish culture and way of life! Have you been to any places I have mentioned, and what are your thoughts? What should I plan when I go to Madrid next?",1,1759707554.0,GoingToSpain,0,1.0,False
1nz3phw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nz3phw/i_30m_tried_to_stay_friends_with_someone_26f_i/,I [30M] tried to stay friends with someone [26F] I used to manage,"This is probably going to be a long story but it‚Äôs been eating away at me and yesterday I received the nastiest message of my life. 

So to begin, I initially hired this person and I was their manager for two years. Over that time we became pretty close, and had what I would describe as a genuine friendship, where we would send texts, reels/memes & chat about our lives. We also had a strong working relationship and she was great at her job which made my life so easy.

Coming from a position of power, I was always very conscious about what I said, making sure to never say anything that could be misinterpreted as anything more than friendly. 

My personal life at the time is somewhat relevant here too as part of a work trip, I took my now fianc√© overseas and proposed. It is something that was widely known about in the organisation and something that I shared openly and proudly. 

However over time as we grew closer, the organisation I worked for had a restructure where Sarah (not real name) was no longer reporting to me. 

Despite my frustration with the organisational change, Sarah and I continued to have 1:1s and keep in touch daily. This went on for about 6 months until I ultimately decided to leave the organisation due to frustration and lack of growth opportunities. 

When I left, I had conversations with Sarah mutually saying that we would stay in touch and I even proposed catching up after work or for coffee once a month or so. Also, in a card I received from the wider team during my exit, she wrote ‚ÄúI know we will stay friends!!!‚Äù

Now here is the situation. 

Starting a new job is hard. It‚Äôs lonely, and I was struggling to make new friends. So I did what I have been doing for the few years. I leant on my friends, including Sarah. 

I continued to send memes, I complained about being the new person and particularity the differences in work processes between the two organisations. After maybe 3 weeks of my new job, I decided to reach out about catching up for a drink by saying that one of the bars we had been to for team drinks was about half way between both of our offices. She reacted to that message at the time with the blush emoji and then started to slow down on her replies. Feeling like I have overstepped, I decided to be straightforward and ask whether that made her uncomfortable? It wasn‚Äôt my intention at all, I just wanted to catch up on all the drama from my old workplace and have a vent about being the new guy again. 

After a few days she replied saying she was busy but it didn‚Äôt make her uncomfortable and that there is nothing to worry about. I took that at face value. 

So I continued to behave somewhat normally but with this lingering feeling that something was wrong. I sent a few memes and messages and photos over the next few weeks, some she responded to, but most she didn‚Äôt. A real difference to how we usually spoke, at least from my perspective. 

So after a while, maybe another week or so, I decided to ask again. For better or worse, I am a straightforward kind of person who would rather know, whatever the reason. But again, no response. I honestly began to get concerned, I wondered if she was not okay, had I done something wrong, or if she really was just busy. 

This is where I probably messed up but it was eating away at me. I probably sent maybe 6-8 messages over the next two to three weeks checking in. I said how I was genuinely concerned, I asked whether something was wrong or I had offended her in anyway and apologised for whatever it could be. 

Over the weekend after a few beers, I decided once again, to send a message, and even called once. I felt like a crazy person and I was well aware that I had probably sent too many messages and even said so within the message but I didn‚Äôt want to just let the friendship go over a situation I didn‚Äôt understand. 

The next morning, after maybe a month of silence, I finally got a response. I‚Äôm actually grateful to have a response as I can finally stop worrying but it honestly was extremely nasty and I guess I‚Äôm wondering if I deserved it. 

It said, not verbatim:

‚ÄúWho do I think I am calling after I didn‚Äôt respond to a message? When I told you nothing was wrong I meant it. 

The way you have been with me recently is extremely inappropriate. To someone who was my manager, it is extremely inappropriate to ask to hang out a month after leaving. And expect me to respond to you within a day or something is wrong. 

You have been acting so clingy and obsessive it has made me extremely uncomfortable. After you left the organisation you should have expected that our friendship would not remain the same.

It‚Äôs also important to remember that just because you‚Äôre blunt, doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone else is comfortable with that. I have been too busy with my life recently that I have not had the time or energy to deal with this situation. 

Whether you like it or not, you were my manager and that power dynamic will always be there for me. You need to realise that the relationship we had at work wasn‚Äôt going to survive one of us leaving and your behaviour has been extremely inappropriate and made me unsure whether I can continue contact, at least for the foreseeable future.‚Äù

Back to me now:

I was quite shocked to read that. I did expect to some degree that I had sent too many messages, I did feel like a crazy person worrying. But after communicating almost every day for three years I thought it was really out of character and I was genuinely concerned about her. I feel like that message really attacks my character and portrays me as some creep, which is something I actively have been extremely careful to avoid in all messages over the last three years. 

I guess I‚Äôm at a loss. I realise the friendship is over, I won‚Äôt be contacting her again but and I‚Äôm left questioning whether it was just one sided this whole time and I was oblivious. 

Was it foolish to think we could be friends?

It started on **September 1st** when I got an email for an interview. The first round was just a casual screening with the recruiter quick conversation, friendly vibe. It went well, and they said they‚Äôd like to move forward to the next round with the **Vice President** and **Customer Success Manager**.

That second round lasted around 40 minutes. It didn‚Äôt even feel like an interview. We had genuine conversations, even a few laughs. Both of them seemed so nice and encouraging. I walked out of that meeting feeling confident for the first time in a long while.

Two days later, I got another email  the recruiter said the VP and CSM were really impressed and wanted to schedule a **case study / product demo** round. I had **three days** to prepare.

Those three days, I gave it everything I had. I stayed up late rehearsing, polishing slides, and trying to make sure I‚Äôd deliver something that actually showed how much I cared about the opportunity. When the day came, the presentation went great. They smiled through most of it, asked smart follow-ups, and said things like, *‚ÄúIt really feels like you‚Äôre already part of our team.‚Äù*

That line stuck with me. It felt like I‚Äôd made it.

A couple of days later, I got a message from the recruiter they wanted to discuss ‚Äúnext steps.‚Äù That turned into another round, the **final interview**, called the *Culture Bar Raiser*. This time it was with the **Chief Marketing Officer**.

That conversation also went smoothly. The CMO was friendly, asked thoughtful questions, and by the end said I‚Äôd done really well. Two days later, the recruiter emailed saying the CMO gave **positive feedback** and that they wanted to **discuss salary and practical details** next. My heart jumped.

I thought, ‚ÄúThis is it. I finally got the job.‚Äù

Then came the final step: the recruiter invited me to **visit their Toronto office** to meet the team. She said it wasn‚Äôt an interview  just a casual get-together before things moved forward.

So I went.

The team welcomed me like I already worked there. They introduced me to the people I‚Äôd be collaborating with, showed me around the office, even demonstrated how the coffee machine worked. One person joked that I‚Äôd better learn to use it because I‚Äôd be needing it a lot soon.

They told me there were no other candidates left. They asked what the recruiter had told me, and I said she just asked me to come meet the team but hadn‚Äôt shared the official offer yet. They looked surprised and said, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs odd  we thought you were already joining us.‚Äù

We had lunch together, laughed, talked about work, travel, and life in general. It didn‚Äôt feel like an interview at all it felt like I was already part of them. Before I left, someone even said,

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really looking forward to working with you from the 14th.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt explain the kind of happiness I felt that day. I walked out of that building with a huge smile, already imagining my first day at work.

Two days later, I opened my inbox to find an email from the recruiter.

It said, *‚ÄúThe team really liked you and you were one of the best candidates we had. However, there were two finalists, and the team decided to move forward with the other candidate based on team comfort.‚Äù*

Just like that.

I stared at that email for a long time. I felt numb. Everything inside me sank. All the excitement, all the energy I had gone in seconds.

What broke me even more was what came next. Just a few hours after reading that email, I saw **the same job posted again on LinkedIn**, same title, same location.

I can‚Äôt even describe how that felt. It wasn‚Äôt just disappointment. It was confusion, betrayal, disbelief  everything all at once.

For a few days, I wasn‚Äôt myself. I felt like a completely different person quiet, drained, and defeated. I started doubting everything about myself. My confidence took a hit I didn‚Äôt see coming.

It‚Äôs strange how something that starts with so much promise can leave you feeling this small.

I know rejections happen, and I‚Äôve faced them before. But this one was different. This one felt personal. I had met them, laughed with them, shared a meal with them. They had said they looked forward to working with me.

And then nothing.

I don‚Äôt know what changed, or if something did at all. Maybe they found someone else. Maybe they just changed their mind. Maybe it was never what I thought it was.

But one thing I do know  I‚Äôll never forget how this experience made me feel.

Sometimes rejection isn‚Äôt just a missed job. It‚Äôs a piece of yourself that you lose in the process.",12,1759707310.0,interviews,5,1.0,False

   - Use tools that suggest catchy headlines. Think about emotional triggers! People click on *""You Won‚Äôt Believe What Happens Next!""* for a reason. üéØ

- **Visuals Matter:** 
   - Mix in some eye-catching visuals or memes. Who doesn‚Äôt love a good meme? They spread like wildfire! üì∏üî•

I know we are probably not alone in this. The USA, for example, is another big offender on sugar addiction. I am not sure yet if more or less than Brazil.

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

The day will break, our eyes will wake and our heads will shake away the responsibilities of the day. 

We'll lay in awe as the rain falls, dancing and trailing down panes of stained glass, each drop colliding and merging with others on their journey to the bottom. 

We'll lay in silence in a world full of violence, steam twirling from her coffee or tea and smoke rolling from my dried tobacco leaf. 

We'll experience true stillness and let the stress pass our minds by, for we will have found the peace that each of us seeks, but many may never reach. 

I've long yearned for these moments, and I hope you learn my darling, I've searched for you high and low, between the reaches of each and every starling.

Some ideas:

\-Starcraft with Station. The ""hero"" ships, USS Enterprise, Enterprise-A, Enterprise-D, Enterprise-E, Enterprise-F, Defiant, Voyager, Discovery, Cerritos, and the NX-01 Enterprise,

\-More Planets. 

\-A load of legendary creatures. Maybe the original series creatures will transform into the ones from the movies and the creatures from The Next Generation will transform into the Star Trek: Picard ones.

\-Q/Trelane/Gary Mitchell/Prophets planewalkers.

\-Phaser equipment and Vulcan Nerve Pinch instant that add stun counters.

\-Transporters that make something unblockable. Shields that make something indestructible.

\-Red Shirts that work like Flagbearers or maybe a \[\[Dauntless Bodygaurd\]\].

\-Tribbles that do self-replication like Scute Bugs.

\-Cardassian/Romulan interrogation card. 

\-Borg card that controls creatures.

\-Tons of alternate art for Spock. 

\-Exploding console card that deals damage to a player and a creature.

\-Some kind of Tea Earl Grey Hot/coffee/Raktajino card.

\-Gorn with original series art and Strange New World stats.

\-The Explore mechanic somewhere in there.

\-Some kind of mission mechanic, like Dungeons or Sagas, with a Warp Core that helps tutor/play them.

\-Maybe a mechanic like Party that uses the Trek crew/away team components of Doctor, Science, Engineer, Security, Commander. Doctors, Scientists, Artificers, Detectives(?), and Soldiers maybe?

Not all of those mechanics are going to be used. This just a shotgun possibilities. I'm sure folks with more experience with the recent sets can zero in on the possibilities of a Star Trek set.

1nz3fj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheDistantGod/comments/1nz3fj9/mondays/,Mondays,"It was just another morning when Phil woke up in his bed and felt strangely weightless. His mind still foggy from sleep, he reached for his phone only to feel it gone. Or rather he felt that he did not feel. And not just the phone, he felt nothing. Not the table under his searching hand, not the bedsheets on his back. Not even the shiver one got when crawling out of bed still half-asleep. Startled by the observation of his missing sensations he jumped out of bed. Looking around he saw his phone lying on the table, the screen showing a missed call from his boss. Another look at the clock next to the phone told Phil that he was three hours late for work. Which was a problem especially this Monday, since he was supposed to defend some poor mandate in a trial. Distressed, the man tore his hair, when the missing sensation once again unsettled him. He looked at his feet, bare on the hard ground. But he didn‚Äôt feel the ground nor the impact of his body when he jumped. It was as if he didn‚Äôt possess any kind of matter and yet his body had to bow to gravity. For he sank back down to the ground after every jump as usual. But no sound was made upon hitting the floor. Phil went to the open window, taking a deep breath. A shower and a coffee would solve the problem, certainly. Perhaps he had worked too much the past weeks and needed a bit of free time to relax. Yes, this must be the issue. Not dwelling on any nonsensical explanations, Phil turned to make his bed. But to his shock, someone else was lying under the cosy blanket. And not just any one, it was Phil. Or rather his body, so the lawyer assumed. Being neither religious, nor a scientist Phil wasn‚Äôt sure what to believe. Was he dreaming and having one of those out of body experiences? Or was there a rational explanation he didn‚Äôt know about? The man discarded the first theory, when suddenly the body started to move with some inaudible grunts. The skin seemed strangely pale, even grey. With stuttering movements Phil‚Äôs body managed to navigate itself towards the room‚Äôs door. Obviously not realising the door was locked, a loud thud let the body collide with the firm wood. Followed by more disgusting grunts the body heaved itself to its feet again.¬†

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Phil uttered out of habit as he stepped to turn the doorknob. The moment he grabbed the metallic object however, instead of really opening the door Phil‚Äôs hand gripped thin air and he found himself on the other side of the closed door on the ground. From inside the still closed room, he could hear his body utter a disappointed grunt.

‚ÄúI am a ghost,‚Äù Phil muttered, not sure how to react to that. Behind him the door suddenly burst as his zombified body stumbled through. Not paying attention to his bodiless soul, the empty corpse dragged itself forwards to the stairs leading down.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think‚Ä¶‚Äù Phil fell silent as Zombie Phil lost his footing and fell down the stairs with many clanks, clonks and some sounds that sounded like breaking bones. Taking after his body, the lawyer found it once again grunting and picking itself up. Whereas the left arm hung a bit loosely downwards in an unnatural angle. Searching the way to the kitchen Phil‚Äôs body made a new sound, a strange mixture of a gaping, growling dog and a croaking raven. Ransacking the kitchen, the corpse looked for something edible. Glasses with jam and juice smashed on the ground, bathing the floor in various liquids.

‚ÄúCome on, don‚Äôt do that. How am I going to clean that up?‚Äù The zombie stopped for a moment, listened and continued on its path of destruction. Finding some raw meat, the corpse devoured it on the spot.

‚ÄúKeep it together Phil, we are a lawyer for God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù Turning to his ghost, the body only uttered another one of his stomach-churning sounds and moved towards the door leading outside. Despair and hopelessness mingled as Phil stared at the room that once had been his priced kitchen. Breaking glass made him run to the door, which had just been smashed by the dead. Coloured glass fragments covered the ground outside, as the corpse still clothed in pyjamas, took a walk.¬†

‚ÄúNo, no, no, no, no,‚Äù Phil followed, agitated about what his neighbours might think if they saw him like this. The sound of popping water balloons let his body topple down once again. A confused grunt from a dumbfounded face was the answer, causing the children to giggle at the stupid picture.¬†

‚ÄúDamned children,‚Äù Phil exclaimed. But none of the living could hear him and so he was ignored. The lawyer thought for a moment. What was happening to him? Was he stoned? Did someone abduct him and flood his system with drugs? Nothing made sense to him at the present. It had to be a dream. Zombies weren‚Äôt real nor were ghosts. Screaming kids made Phil glance towards the street. His body was trying to catch them, probably to eat their brains.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare!‚Äù Phil cried out hurrying after his husk. And then everything happened too quickly for the man to register. Somewhere a car came down the road, the sound of breaking bones and screeching tires became one. And the last thing Phil saw before everything went black was the mangled mess of what once had been his body.

Munteras opened his eyes slowly as he woke up. His colleague had already detached the wires and cables enabling him to be part of the simulation.

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù The voice of his friend Orostris came from next to him. The violet eyes glinting with mischief. Having awakened from a 30 year dream, which had only lasted a mere hour, Munteras got up.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell, mate.‚Äù He yelled out but couldn‚Äôt suppress the laughter in his voice.

‚ÄúI told you; I could add a modification.‚Äù His friend grinned, satisfied with his success.

‚ÄúA zombie, Orostris? A zombie?‚Äù Munteras said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI asked to be a cat. Not a babbling, rich idiot having an out of body experience.‚Äù The other Uranian only shrugged, his scaly skin turning from blue to green indicating his mood.

‚ÄúYou said make it fun,‚Äù he grinned. ‚ÄúCome on, it‚Äôs my turn now.‚Äù Shushing Munteras from the chair, Orostris sat down.

‚ÄúI am going to throw you into a pack of wolves, I swear.‚Äù Munteras only threatened his friend, who gave him a thumbs up. Taking his friend‚Äôs place in front of the computers the simulation was started anew.¬†",1,1759706793.0,u_TheDistantGod,0,1.0,False
1nz3f1z,https://i.redd.it/uocgwtixkdtf1.png,"52 Weeks to the Badge - The Pumpkin Patch, The Black Sharpie & Your First Time...","I took my granddaughter to the pumpkin patch the other day, and it hit me...  
**Picking a pumpkin is a lot like picking the right candidate in an interview.**

At first glance?  
They all look the same. Orange. Round. Sitting neatly in rows.

Same with candidates.  
Some pumpkins are certified organic. Some candidates are certified EMT or Medic.  
The award-winning pumpkins? They‚Äôre grown with intention.

And that‚Äôs exactly what you need to be doing too.  
**There needs to be intention behind everything you do** toward this goal.

Otherwise, you blend in with the rest of the patch.

Clean haircut. Dark suit. Power tie.  
EMT. Academy. Medic cert.  
***They all check the boxes.***

But just like pumpkins, you don‚Äôt know if someone‚Äôs the right one  
until you look inside.

What are you hiring the pumpkin to do?  
Be carved for Halloween?  
Be baked into a pie?

That determines what kind of pumpkin you need.

Same with you.

The panel is trying to figure out what you‚Äôre made for.  
Can you be counted on for the next 30 years?  
Or are you one of those moldy pumpkins  
that doesn‚Äôt even make it to Halloween or Thanksgiving?

***And here‚Äôs the inside secret:***  
You can‚Äôt just hope they figure it out.  
You have to ***show them*** what‚Äôs inside.

That‚Äôs your job in the interview.  
To cut the top off and let them see the guts.  
Show them what your made of. So they says:  
***""This isn‚Äôt just another pumpkin, this one‚Äôs got something special.""***

# The Black Sharpie

Now let‚Äôs talk about the Black Sharpie.

There‚Äôs a reason people reach for it.  
It‚Äôs not flashy. It doesn‚Äôt change colors.  
**It‚Äôs consistent. Permanent. Dependable.**

You know what you‚Äôre getting when you pull the cap.

That‚Äôs who you need to be.

Someone they can count on.  
Not the dry-erase marker that fades halfway through the shift.

The panel isn‚Äôt just hiring skill.  
They‚Äôre hiring commitment.  
They‚Äôre looking for **permanent**.

They‚Äôre thinking,  
*""Is this the kind of person who will still be here 30 years from now?""*

That‚Äôs the Sharpie.  
That‚Äôs who you want to be.

# Your First Time

*You never forget your first time.*

First car.  
First apartment.  
First kiss.  
*(And yeah, maybe that first time too.)*

Why do you remember it?  
**Because it mattered.**  
It marked a moment where everything changed.

**That‚Äôs what your interview needs to feel like for the panel.**

You're not just another candidate.  
You need a story. An impression that sticks.

You want to be the one they‚Äôre still talking about  
after the doors close.

# So how do you stand out in a pumpkin patch?

How do you become the Sharpie instead of the fading Dry Erase marker?  
How do you make them feel like it‚Äôs their ***first time*** meeting someone unforgettable?

Here are **5 ways to make your mark**:

# 1. Reverse Engineer Something Remarkable

Look for opportunities to do something meaningful before you ever walk into the panel room.

Write them down. Build the story. Craft it with **intention.**

* Start a clothing drive for the homeless.
* Use your EMT skills on a medical mission.
* Serve meals at a soup kitchen.
* Whatever it is; **make it yours**.

They won‚Äôt remember your resume.  
But they‚Äôll remember the guy who ran a fundraiser  
so a kid with leukemia could ride a fire engine to his last treatment. That's REMARKABLE!

# 2. Skate to Where the Puck Is Going

Gretzky said it best.

Find an *up and coming* trend in the Fire Service and become an expert in it.

* Maybe it‚Äôs drones.
* Maybe it‚Äôs AI in public safety.
* Maybe it‚Äôs nuclear power or lithium battery fires.

Whatever you identify as that trend, **own it**.  
Let the panel know you saw it coming, studied it, and prepared to be the go to guy on it.

This shows **vision**, **initiative**, and **leadership**.  
You‚Äôre not waiting to be told what to learn; you‚Äôre already on it.

# 3. Find the Inside Playbook

""*I tracked down the rookie you hired two years ago who‚Äôs thriving here.*  
*Took him to coffee and asked him what it takes to succeed in this department.""*

**Do that.**

It shows you‚Äôre invested in **this** department, not just *any* badge.

You‚Äôre building relationships. You‚Äôre seeking mentorship.  
And you‚Äôre listening to the people already wearing the patch.

**Bonus**  
If that guy‚Äôs been pegged as ***‚ÄúThe Guy,‚Äù***  
There‚Äôs a good chance the panel already knows your name before you even walk in.

# 4. Turn Weakness Into a Differentiator

Most candidates hide their weaknesses.

**OWN YOURS!**

*""I bombed my first CPAT attempt.*  
*So I hired a coach. Fixed my mechanics.*  
*And came back stronger.""*

That shows humility. Resilience. Commitment.  
You didn‚Äôt make excuses. You made progress.

You‚Äôre not the kind of person who gives up.  
**You can be counted on.**

# 5. Close with: ‚ÄúWhy I‚Äôm Different‚Äù

*""I know most candidates will take every test out there and try to fit into whichever department hires them. That‚Äôs fine. This is a tough job to get.*

*But I made a different choice.*

*I identified this department as the place I want to spend my career.*  
*I visited your stations. I sat down with your firefighters*  
*and sought out the ones their peers said were the best.*

*I asked what it takes to succeed here.*

*Over the last 18 months, I‚Äôve studied your requirements*  
*and dedicated myself to meeting them.*

*I didn‚Äôt prepare to be a firefighter.*  
*I prepared to be* ***your*** *firefighter.*

*I‚Äôm ready today to prove it.*  
*Not just for this interview, but for the next 30 years.*

*The decision you make here could be the best hiring decision you‚Äôve ever made.*  
*And I‚Äôm here to back that up.""*

**You want to stand out?**  
Start today.

Because the pumpkins are lining up.  
The panel‚Äôs got their Sharpie uncapped.  
And someone is about to leave a mark they‚Äôll never forget.

PONDER THIS  
  
The closer we get to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the more we need the house of God, and the more we need the people of God. We need to practice separation from the world and communication with the people of God. It‚Äôs not always easy, but this is the way God designed us to get through life in this world. We need each other; we need Him.  
  
Remember what you‚Äôve learned. Don‚Äôt doubt in the dark what God has shown you in the light. Remember the Word of God and remember who you learned it from. Hold onto His truth and to the community He has given you to learn it with. This is how we continue to stand strong. God has given you a family for a purpose; don‚Äôt neglect to gather with them.  
  
How do you invest in the people in your church community? How have you grown with them?  
  
How do you invest in your relationship with God? How have you grown in your relationship with Him?  
  
PRACTICE THIS  
  
Spend time with your church family over a meal or coffee and ask these loved ones to share how they have grown in their relationships with God. APR

The thing is she doesn't understand what jealousy is no matter how much I explain it to her. And I hate some of his actions, I've seen him hit on her, hugs her a lot, tells her that he loves her everytime he gets the chance and tries to do a lot of spontaneous things like getting her food/coffee at work or buying her drinks everytime they hang out, and he asks her out every weekend.
I know my boundaries and i tried to explain them to her, and for me it's should be respect from both of them to stop hanging out until he stops having feelings at least, I don't like how he is a threat, it makes me feel like he's sitting there waiting for a minor problem to shoot his shot and get in. Like a bear waiting outside the door for it to unlock.
It's not about trust, I trust my gf I know she loves me and she wouldn't cheat on me, just his actions and the fact that they hang out lon1 feels threatening to me.
And to her it's just a ""friend thing to do"" even though I have tons of friends. He buys coffee, commutes for an hour and a half just to surprise her and give it to her at work, I would just call my friend and hang out with him/ her after they're done working.
How do I deal with this situation? Ik if it was the other way around I would cut the girl off, but she doesn't wanna cut him off and I think that I should respect that.

I don‚Äôt move as it goes off. I just lay there with my eyes open staring up at the ceiling, mind blank, the awful noise of the alarm playing. I feel my boyfriend James turn over in bed and turn the alarm off.¬†

‚ÄúYou okay baby? Why didn‚Äôt you turn the alarm off?‚Äù I glance over at him all I see is a shell of what used to be my boyfriend.

He has changed so much for no reason and I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take. I shift my eyes back up to the ceiling wishing I was anywhere but next to him in this apartment full of hatred. I feel him get up and I listen to his footsteps as he walks around the room.

‚ÄúLets go to the kitchen and make some coffee‚Äù He says as he helps me get up from the bed slowly and methodically¬† moving me to the kitchen tears welling up in my eyes.

James comes up and hugs me from behind his arms draped around my waist. I want to lean into him but his body and hands are cold, menacing, and unwelcoming. He kisses the back of my head, his lips feeling like icicles stabbing me. All of my attention is focused on the coffeemaker spitting out the coffee as soon as it finishes he grabs it and starts making his way out the front door.¬†

He speaks up before shutting the door ‚ÄúMake sure you clean the apartment today. I‚Äôll see if I can get off work early and we'll take pictures in front of the tree and open presents early.‚Äù He says with a smile but his eyes don't move his grey piercing gaze staring right through me. I say nothing just staring ahead as he exits the apartment silence filling up the space quickly.

Today doesn‚Äôt even feel like Christmas Eve, just another boring day filled with sadness. Suddenly I hear my phone ringing in the bedroom. I run to it because I know it's my mom calling me. The only thing keeping me going is talking to my mom everyday. I answer the phone enthusiastically, excited to talk to my mother. Instead of my moms voice on the other side of the phone it was a man. ‚ÄúIs this Clara Summers daughter of Maria Summers?‚Äù¬†

I croak out a small yes, a lump growing in my throat. The only words I heard was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù before I hung up the phone not needing to hear the rest. I fall to the floor devastated and as a last resort I dial James number. The ringing echoed through the apartment for a few seconds before he answered.¬†

‚ÄúHey, what's up?‚Äù He asks I muster up the courage to speak to him ‚ÄúMy mom she‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, not able to finish the sentence before breaking down and sobbing. ‚ÄúOh honey I‚Äôm so sorry I would try to come home early but I got a ton of work to do‚Äù¬†

I hang up and lay down on the floor for an hour before finally getting up to get started on cleaning. I walk to the kitchen to get the cleaning supplies from underneath the sink and start making my way towards the living room.

  
I stare at the mess remembering last night's incident. I get on my knees and begin scrubbing the blood out of the carpet. Once I get all the blood out I pick up the broken glass from the picture frame of me and James he threw at me last night. After cleaning everything I go to the bedroom to grab my purse off of the desk and head out of the apartment.¬†

I start walking to the nearest sporting goods store. When I get there I head to the desk where the pocket knives are. I don't bother looking at them, I just get the cheapest one I pay for it and begin making my way home again. Once I get back to the apartment I lay down on the bed and text James what time he will be home.¬†

He responds a few minutes later with 5:30 and a little heart emoji next to it. A faint smile appears on my face. I can sense the old him in that text, the old him I yearn so desperately to come back. I check the time and set an alarm for 5:28 pm. That should be just enough time. I lay in bed staring up at the ceiling. I replay my plan in my head over and over again. This will make James see how I am really feeling, it will bring the old him back and we're gonna be happy again. No more dinners in silence, no more nights ending in violence and blood dripping onto the carpet.¬†

My alarm goes off and this time I turn it off and I walk to the kitchen pocket knife in hand and body trembling. I lean against the counter letting my body slide to the floor. It‚Äôs 5:29 and he should be coming through that door any second now. I take one more look at the knife in my hand, the blade shining in the light.¬†

I suddenly begin to slash at my arms the knife going into my skin deep and rough. Then the sound of the door opening echoes through the apartment and James shuffles into the kitchen and lets out a loud gasp as he rushes towards me.

He crouches down next to me and my eyes shift to his face shocked to find a twisted smile stretched across his face.¬†

‚ÄúWhat a lovely Christmas present Clara I really couldn't think of anything better to get me. Now I can finally live my life without having to come home to your depressing ass.‚Äù He stands up and watches for a few minutes as I bleed out on the kitchen floor.¬†

My vision begins to grow blurry. My last memories of James being happy I‚Äôm dying. He then calls the police ‚ÄúPlease get someone here quick my girlfriend she cut herself and I think she‚Äôs bleeding out. I just got home from work, please hurry.‚Äù He says with a fake panic in his voice. The paramedics and police got here a few minutes later but it was no use. I was dead.

James would then go on to live his life happily guilt-free and no regrets. Until a year later it was Christmas Eve and he walked into his apartment going to the kitchen to make dinner. Until he looks down and sees me in the same spot as last year. I‚Äôm bleeding out and my eyes looking up at him begging him to save me.¬†

His eyes widen in horror as the realization sets in that he played a part in my death. Suddenly all the guilt, regret, and loneliness sets in. He hasn't realized how lonely it's been without me. A part of him was truly gone and he will never get it back. He ran to the balcony to get some fresh air so he could breathe properly. As he leans against the railing he looks down and suddenly the pavement is calling to him. He thought about how wonderful it would feel for his body to hit the hard ground.



Before he can realize what he's doing he stands on the railing staring at the ground until he suddenly jumps forward. He felt the breeze on his face relishing in the feeling until he didn't feel anything anymore. Blood splattering on the pavement and people screaming in horror.

I‚Äôve had the Lee for maybe 5 or 6 years now and mainly shoot 9mm for competitions and 5.56. The two I‚Äôm considering are a Dillion 750XL or the RL 1100. I really like the idea of adding a bullet feeder and powder check simultaneously and I also had a solid amount of mixed mil-spec and commercial 5.56 I‚Äôve been meaning to reload( the swager would be nice for this on the 1100). I would add a case feeder regardless to the xl750 and the 1100 comes with one. 

It would be around $1400 for a 750xl base with a roller handle, 9mm conversion, and case feeder assembly. I would only have the option to run either a bullet feeder or powder check with this set up. 

The RL1100 starting setup would be would be $2500 and would have all the options above. I could also run a bullet feeder and powder check simultaneously. 

This does not include caliber conversions and tool heads  for other cartridges. 

Main question and I know ‚Äúworth it‚Äô is subjective but is  there enough value that the $1100 dollar difference makes it worth it? 

I tend to reload anywhere from 200-250 rounds at the time (that‚Äôs all I have time for since I have to do everything manually on my Lee press, it‚Äôs been ridden hard). 

I enjoy reloading as it‚Äôs a nice way to enjoy a couple cups of coffee before the kids get up on a Saturday. I really want less headache and stress when reloading, the ability to sit down and crank out 500 quality rounds easily at a time then go hit the t-ball and soccer fields up later in the morning. 

I‚Äôve also watched all the Dillion videos and videos as well. 

Sorry for the long one.

1nz31lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nz31lr/behind_the_sliding_door/,Behind the Sliding Door,"The lake looked hungover most mornings‚Äîflat, gray, pretending not to remember wind. I‚Äôd stand on the deck with my coffee and try to convince myself the water‚Äôs calm meant ours was possible. One month. That‚Äôs what we told June when we moved into her spare suite: thirty days, forty tops, until our place cleared inspection and we could stop living out of bins.

June joked about us squatting. ‚ÄúIf my chairs go missing, I‚Äôm calling the news,‚Äù she said, laughing, not laughing. She had the kind of smile that pared a joke to the bone and left it on the counter, daring you to season it.

We‚Äôd been friends once‚Äîwine nights that turned into kitchen confessions, the sort of closeness that made me think agreeing to this arrangement was adult and generous rather than, as it turned out, naive. The house sat on a sloped lot, glass facing the lake like a staged apology. Our ‚Äúsuite‚Äù was a former rec room with a sliding door to the main living area. From the start, the door was temperamental; by the third week, temper had become policy.

Evan tried optimism like a sweater that never quite fit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs temporary,‚Äù he said. He stacked our bins neatly in the corner, labeled everything in blocky handwriting. He changed the batteries in the smoke detector and, unasked, put felt pads under the chairs so they wouldn‚Äôt scrape. This is what he does: smooths edges, makes a case for patience.

June‚Äôs rules showed up one at a time. At first they were reasonable. No shoes on the rugs, wipe down the shower, don‚Äôt run the dryer after eleven because the lint trap screams. Then they were precise. Label your food, use only the left half of the fridge deli drawer, a tidy list taped above the thermostat in Sharpie: DO NOT PASS 70¬∞ (ELECTRIC BILL!). The list sprouted a cousin on the fridge‚ÄîHousehold Safety Policy‚Äîwith bullet points that sounded like a lawyer having a bad day. Tenants must announce entry to common areas. Tenants assume risk of injury. Landlord may restrict access to appliances in case of unsafe operation.

‚ÄúDid you print this off a website?‚Äù I asked when I found it.
‚ÄúPinterest,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs common sense.‚Äù

The Wi-Fi password changed first. ‚ÄúOh shoot,‚Äù June said when I asked. ‚ÄúForgot to text you. New security. Tyler‚Äî‚Äù She stopped herself. ‚ÄúOld habit. Evan. I‚Äôll write it down.‚Äù

She never did. Evan shrugged and turned our phones into hotspots. ‚ÄúTwo more weeks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can do almost anything for two more weeks.‚Äù

The TV upstairs developed a medical need for high volume. Even when she was outside, it blared softly into the bones of the house‚Äîcommercial jingles you could hum through a pillow, a crime show that narrated itself right through drywall. On days she left the TV on while she ran errands, I muted it with a remote I kept hidden in a drawer. The next day I‚Äôd find the remote stuck to the underside of the coffee table with double-sided tape.

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs messing with us,‚Äù I told Evan.
‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs particular,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot malicious.‚Äù

He said the same thing about the sliding door the first night it locked. We came home late, and the glass wouldn‚Äôt budge. June appeared in the dark kitchen, an outline with a phone light trained on our shoes.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she said, too brightly. ‚ÄúJust checking the latch. Old doors like to drift.‚Äù She was barefoot. The phone light drifted to my feet, then to Evan‚Äôs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back late.‚Äù
‚ÄúWork ran long,‚Äù I said, though I didn‚Äôt owe her the detail and didn‚Äôt have it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be quiet.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo worries,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe house carries sound.‚Äù She said it like a threat wrapped in a fun fact.

After that, the door began to stick more often. It clicked at odd hours. Once, when I was in the shower, it slid open a fraction and then, slowly, closed.
‚ÄúWe have to leave,‚Äù I told Evan, half-wet on the bathmat. ‚ÄúSooner than the inspection.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe will,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt force the bank to move faster. For now, lock from our side. Let me talk to her about the door.‚Äù

He did. For a few days it behaved. The TV grew quieter. The fridge list stayed the same. I almost managed to convince myself I‚Äôd been dramatic.

Then the little things began to go.

A spare key we kept in a cereal box. A bowl I used in the mornings. A bottle opener, not special, just ours. The key turned up on the windowsill with a note: Found this lol. The bowl reappeared in the upstairs cabinet labeled PASTA BOWLS in June‚Äôs slanted hand, as if our possessions had been adopted and given better names. The bottle opener I never saw again.

I started a journal. Times, dates, small facts. I wasn‚Äôt trying to build a case so much as I wanted to stop gaslighting myself. Door locked at 9:12 p.m. TV loud at 6:40 a.m. Bowl reappeared upstairs 3:15 p.m. Wi-Fi networks multiplied: LakeLife, LakeLifeGuest, LakeLifeKidsOnly, LakeLife!123 (5G). June says ‚Äúinnsurance‚Äù with two n‚Äôs.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Evan said when he saw me writing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll make yourself crazy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying not to be crazy,‚Äù I said.
He pulled me to him and kissed my temple. ‚ÄúTwo weeks,‚Äù he said again, like weather, like fact.

June began to invite Evan upstairs when I wasn‚Äôt around. She needed help with a leaky faucet that didn‚Äôt leak when I checked it. She had questions about installing an outdoor camera. She wanted his opinion on paint colors. When I came up behind them one afternoon, she was showing him screenshots of neighborhood alerts: Suspicious activity near the lake. Person with flashlight at 2:13 a.m. The photos were blur and grain and reflection.

‚ÄúWe should be careful,‚Äù she said. She didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúI heard something the other night.‚Äù
‚ÄúFootsteps?‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúCould be,‚Äù she said, making a mouth like she was tasting a possibility. ‚ÄúOld houses carry sound.‚Äù

That night I woke to a sweep of light at the sliding door‚Äîslow, horizontal, like a search. Evan was asleep, his breathing even. I held my breath and watched the light pause, then tilt away, magician‚Äôs hand withdrawing. In the morning, I found faint arcs on the deck like scuff marks. June‚Äôs boots, lined by the slider, matched the curve.
‚ÄúWho would she be protecting us from,‚Äù I asked Evan, ‚Äúif she were the one outside with a light?‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe she heard something and checked,‚Äù he said, but he didn‚Äôt quite make eye contact.

I moved the journal from my nightstand to the back of a kitchen drawer. When I checked it three days later, the last entry was underlined in blue ink. I don‚Äôt own a blue pen.
I started leaving my phone recording on the counter when I went to shower. The first day, I caught a rustle and door squeak and a hum that could‚Äôve been the fridge, the old house, or a person. The second day, nothing. The third, the file was gone.

On a Sunday, June posted a printed schedule on the fridge: Shared Kitchen Hours. Our names were assigned time blocks. Ours were early morning and late evening. Her blocks were everything else.
‚ÄúIs this a joke?‚Äù I asked. My voice came out thinner than I intended.
She took a beat to pretend she hadn‚Äôt heard the fight in it. ‚ÄúBoundaries,‚Äù she said cheerfully. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs healthier.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor who?‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my house,‚Äù she said, sweet as a burn. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôll start there.‚Äù

Evan tried to split the difference. He put a small table in our suite and called it a kitchenette. He bought a plug-in hot plate. ‚ÄúA few more days,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be funny later.‚Äù
I wanted it to be funny. I wanted to look back and laugh about meal slots and password safari. But the house had started to feel like a personality test we were failing. The glass reflected us back as thin versions.

The storm came on a Thursday. The weather alert did the phone-banshee thing that makes you feel like the sky is a person calling your name. June stood on the deck watching the lake bruise. ‚ÄúWe may lose power,‚Äù she announced, as if she‚Äôd written the forecast. ‚ÄúCandles are upstairs. I‚Äôll be locking the sliding door to make sure wind doesn‚Äôt rattle it off the track.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt locks from both sides,‚Äù I said.
She smiled with all her teeth. ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù
The wind arrived fast, dinner plates slamming cabs, trees bending their knees. When the power went, the house exhaled, then felt suddenly very present‚Äîeach wall a shoulder, each window an eye. The TV died mid-sentence upstairs; the silence left a shape as loud as any sound.
Evan found our flashlights. One was dead. The other worked if you pinched it like a reluctant bug. The sliding door took its chance and misbehaved. From our side, it wouldn‚Äôt slide. From upstairs, something tapped it twice, like knuckles. I said nothing.

The first crash came from the kitchen. A pan, maybe, or the complaint of a cutlery drawer yanked wide. Then June‚Äôs voice, high, the way people sound when they want to be both frightened and in charge of the fright. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she called into the dark. ‚ÄúIs someone there?‚Äù

Evan put his hand on the doorjamb and listened hard. ‚ÄúStay,‚Äù he said, meaning me. He lifted the latch; it didn‚Äôt budge. ‚ÄúJune?‚Äù he called. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

Footsteps. Then light‚ÄîJune‚Äôs flashlight beam steady as a plan, cutting through the door‚Äôs seam. ‚ÄúI saw someone at the window,‚Äù she said, a little breathless. ‚ÄúThey ran.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhich window?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúThe one by your‚Äî‚Äù She stopped. ‚ÄúBy the downstairs hallway.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no window there,‚Äù I said.
The light bobbed. ‚ÄúI mean‚Äî I thought‚Äî‚Äù She laughed, a sharp thing. ‚ÄúSorry. Storm brain.‚Äù

Evan went up the back stairs to check the locks. I stayed in our suite and used my phone‚Äôs weak flashlight to scan the floor, under the futon, the corners where a shadow could decide to be more. The room had become a different country. The bins looked like strangers, the labels too sure of themselves.

In the beam‚Äôs edge, something caught. A small square tucked into the L between couch and wall. I reached down and pulled it free. A phone. Not ours. Not new. Recording app open. Timestamp: 00:02:13.

My scalp prickled. I felt the urge to put it back exactly, pretend I had never touched what was touching me. Instead I opened the audio.

Silence at first. Then the scrape of the sliding door, a small laugh I knew and didn‚Äôt want to know, Evan‚Äôs name in June‚Äôs whisper like a coin slid across a bar. The recording stopped, started, stopped, as if the phone had been palmed and pocketed and set again.

Footsteps above me, then on the stairs, then outside our door. I put the phone under the couch cushion and stepped back.

The sliding door slid, slow as a breath through teeth. Evan‚Äôs silhouette, then June‚Äôs behind him like a shadow that didn‚Äôt belong to anything.

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs locked,‚Äù Evan said. He looked pale in the flashlight glow. ‚ÄúBut the deck gate is open.‚Äù
‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù June said. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs prowling.‚Äù
‚ÄúOr you opened it,‚Äù I said. I had meant for it to sound calm, clean. The words came out raw.
Her face went still. ‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe because you like controlling what everyone‚Äôs afraid of,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe because you‚Äôre bored. Maybe because you‚Äôre sick.‚Äù

It was too much. It sounded crazy. I heard it. Evan flinched.
‚ÄúYou know what?‚Äù June said softly. ‚ÄúI was going to be nice. I was going to say, let‚Äôs revisit the timeline in the morning. But I‚Äôm done. You need to leave. Now.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn a storm?‚Äù Evan asked. ‚ÄúBe reasonable.‚Äù
Her laugh was a knife. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being reasonable. You,‚Äù she told me without looking at me, ‚Äúare unstable. You‚Äôve been recording me. You‚Äôve been moving things and blaming me. You‚Äôve been‚Äî‚Äù She gestured at the air, harvesting words. ‚ÄúEscalating.‚Äù

I wanted to argue. I wanted to drag the phone from under the cushion and play it, make truth do its job. Instead I heard myself say, too quiet, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in our room.‚Äù
Evan‚Äôs head snapped. June‚Äôs smile skittered. ‚ÄúWhy would I want to be in here?‚Äù she said, making here sound like an illness.
‚ÄúBecause you want to watch,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBecause you can‚Äôt stand that we live a life inside your house that isn‚Äôt about you.‚Äù

Lightning whitened the glass. For a second, all three of us were cutouts on a lightbox. Then the world went black again, small and human.
From upstairs, a bang. Front door? Cabinet? The house shook its shoulders.
Evan motioned toward the stairs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check the front,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù He didn‚Äôt finish. He looked at me like I was a problem with two true answers.

He went. June stayed, her flashlight low, painting the floor. ‚ÄúYou should pack,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt have this in my home.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll pack,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll leave you a note.‚Äù I made a smile that felt borrowed. ‚ÄúA friendly one.‚Äù

Her light stuttered across the couch cushion. I willed it to move on. It did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA prowler is one thing. A tenant who threatens me is another.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho threatened you?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou did,‚Äù she said, too evenly. ‚ÄúJust now. You said you‚Äôd leave a note.‚Äù She blinked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean when you say friendly.‚Äù
I laughed. I couldn‚Äôt help it. ‚ÄúOf course you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Upstairs, Evan called for me. ‚ÄúFront door‚Äôs fine. But‚Äî‚Äù He stopped. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs water by the back window.‚Äù
I took my chance. ‚ÄúGo help him,‚Äù I said to June. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start packing.‚Äù

She looked at me too long, calculating new math. Then she went, a soft sweep of socks on stairs.

I pulled the phone from under the cushion and slipped it in my pocket. My hands shook. In the dim, I rolled one bin forward and stacked two others on top. Pack what you can, I thought. Documents, chargers, the few clothes that still felt like mine.

I found our spare car key in the cereal box where it had reappeared. I found a note on the inside flap of our bin labeled WINTER: This is not your house. I left it there.

The storm got bored of rage and settled into purpose. The house breathed with it. I could hear June‚Äôs voice upstairs, fast and controlled, the register people use when they‚Äôre speaking for a recording. For a second I wondered if she‚Äôd put a phone somewhere to catch us again. For a second I wondered if she‚Äôd been catching us all along.

When the police lights finally lit the curve of the driveway, they turned the lake into an emergency. June‚Äôs relief was theatrical. ‚ÄúOfficer,‚Äù she called in a tone minted for sympathy, ‚Äúthank goodness. There‚Äôs been someone trying to get in. And my tenants are‚Äî‚Äù She looked directly at me through the sliding door glass. ‚ÄúFrightened.‚Äù

Evan stood half a step behind her, the expression of a man learning to count in a new language. The officer took statements the way people take coats‚Äîpolitely, without promise. June‚Äôs was crisp. Evan‚Äôs was careful. Mine was brief. I didn‚Äôt mention the phone.
‚ÄúStorms do weird things to houses,‚Äù the officer said finally, eyes on June‚Äôs boots by the slider, the wet arcs outside. ‚ÄúLocks swell, doors stick, branches knock.‚Äù He looked at us like he wanted to be anywhere else. ‚ÄúYou all be careful.‚Äù

After they left, June found her composure and a hair tie. ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she said, as if the night had been a temp.
‚ÄúWhat did you tell them?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúThe truth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat there were noises. That you‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù
Evan blinked. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt agree to that.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, you did,‚Äù she said sweetly. ‚ÄúJust now.‚Äù

He looked at me. I looked at him. We didn‚Äôt say what we were both thinking: that sometimes the reasonable thing is leaving before reason gets carved down to a rule on the fridge.
We packed. Not everything. The bins that mattered. The rest of our life could catch up or grow mold. Evan carried the heavier ones, moving like a person inventing a different future with each lift. I took pictures of the rooms as if I were making a record for a judge who would never read it. June stood on the deck and watched, her arms folded, the lake polishing its face behind her.

At the door, I put a note on the counter out of spite and habit both. June‚Äîthank you for the time here. We‚Äôre moving out today. Text to coordinate returning keys. I underlined coordinate twice and felt better than I should have.
When we left, she didn‚Äôt wave. The storm had rinsed the air so clean it made my teeth ache. Evan‚Äôs truck felt like an answer.

We drove to a motel with a number in the name and a smell of other people‚Äôs plans. Evan fell asleep hard, his jaw unclenching in stages. I sat at the end of the bed with the other phone in my hand and thought about evidence, about truth, about how a recording fixes nothing if the person hearing it has already decided. I pressed play anyway. I listened to June whisper Evan‚Äôs name. I listened to my own voice in the background on some earlier day, laughing at something that wasn‚Äôt funny.

When the recording ended, I scrolled. There were more files. Days and days of our life, sliced. June humming. Evan talking to himself in the kitchen. Me on the deck saying we can do anything for two weeks like a dare.

I didn‚Äôt wake him. I went into the bathroom and locked the door and stared at the motel mirror until my face resolved. I opened my notes app and wrote one line: Do not forgive a house for teaching you to be small.

In the morning, June texted. Please leave keys under mat. Also, you left a bowl. I‚Äôll donate.
Evan looked at the screen over my shoulder. ‚ÄúBlock her,‚Äù he said, and though it was small and late, the words warmed me.

We dropped the keys. I put the phone I‚Äôd taken in a padded mailer and addressed it to myself care of our new place‚Äîstill imaginary, but less imaginary than before. I didn‚Äôt want to carry her voice any farther than I had to. On the way to the post office, we drove past the lake road. The house sat with its glass face glazed, the deck chairs stacked like a threat, the sliding door catching light.

‚ÄúThat door,‚Äù Evan said, and we both laughed in the way that means not yet.

Our closing was delayed another week, then another. We lived in that motel until the lady at the desk started greeting us by name and sliding me extra coffee pods. Nights, I woke to the hum of the air conditioner half convinced it was the TV upstairs, and had to talk myself back into the room with the paintings of sailboats and the safe that didn‚Äôt work. Days, we filled forms and looked at paint chips for walls we did not yet own. We made something like a plan.

The day we finally got the keys to our own quiet, ordinary house, the air smelled like cut grass and dried rain. The rooms were smaller than I‚Äôd imagined and kinder. There was a sliding door to the porch‚Äîof course there was‚Äîand I touched the handle like a test. It moved easily, no sticks, no clicks. I locked it from our side and watched the mechanism seat with a firm little yes.

That night, I dreamed of the lake. In the dream, June stood on the deck with her phone held up not as a light but as a mirror, trying to catch our reflection and make it belong to her. When I woke, our new house was dark and honest. Evan‚Äôs breathing was the right kind of sound. I stood, padded barefoot to the sliding door, and put my palm flat against the glass. The lock was set. The door rattled, faintly, because houses breathe.

I waited for the old panic to climb my spine. It didn‚Äôt. The room held.

On the second morning, a text from an unknown number: Did you mean to send me this? A photo followed‚Äîmy note on June‚Äôs counter, the lake behind it, a pale smudge of someone‚Äôs reflection in the glass. The number wasn‚Äôt June‚Äôs. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I knew. The timestamp said 2:13 a.m.
I stared at it long enough for the coffee to go cold. Then I slid the text thread into the trash and set my phone face down on the table. Outside, our fence needed painting. The grass needed a haircut. The day needed me to choose it on purpose.

Later, I went to the porch and checked the sliding door again. Locked, from the inside. The glass showed me my face, not anyone else‚Äôs. Still, when the wind pushed, the frame shivered‚Äîjust a little‚Äîand the door gave a tiny, habitual rattle, like an old house clearing its throat to speak.
I left it to talk to itself. I had walls to paint. A bed to build. A life with fewer lists.

That night, after Evan fell asleep, I took my journal‚Äîthe motel version, slim and patient‚Äîand wrote until the words stopped feeling like evidence and turned into air. At the bottom of the page I drew a neat box and inside it wrote:
‚Äî If a door locks from both sides, choose the one that keeps you home.

I closed the book. I turned off the light. Somewhere in the dark of the house, wood settled, glass murmured, and a hundred yesterday sounds knocked softly and receded, as if trying one last time to be let back in.

The options for food was simple. The drinks were simple. Everyone loved Tim Hortons. Eventually I started changing my coffee less cream and then less sugar, until I was able to drink it black.

I was now hooked on dark roast. Most days making 6 or 7 trips. But then something changed. Longer lineups, too many options to order. Started using the app. That was way quicker. But then something happened again. Longer wait times for mobile orders. All the regular workers no longer worked there. Things really went to downhill really fast. So I stopped going. Best thing ever! I brew coffee at home. I have ordered coffee from around the world. My love for coffee is crazy. But what I love the most and what I'd like to say thank you for is, Thank you for being greedy. Thank you for becoming money hungry and forgetting how to treat customers.

This weekend, I was determined to finally take a solo step toward a more active social life, but my anxiety put up a terrifying last stand.

I got dressed, got my keys, and successfully put my shoes on‚Äîthe ultimate commitment signal. But right there, staring at the doorknob, the anxiety hit me like a wall. My chest got tight, my mind flooded with ""what-ifs,"" and I simply couldn't get myself to turn the knob. I ended up just taking my shoes off and retreating back to my computer.

I can only manage to go out if I'm with a trusted friend, and that's creating a major mental block:

I absolutely hate feeling like a sidekick or an NPC (non-player character) in my own life. I feel like I'm just waiting for the ""main character"" (my friend) to decide where we go, introduce me, or talk to me. I want to feel present, initiate things, and be the active participant, but the anxiety turns me into a silent, passive observer whenever I'm in a social setting.

This feeling of inertia and being mentally ""stuck"" is crushing.

Seeking Your Best Hacks:

 * Beating the Final Boss (The Doorknob): For those who've overcome the paralyzing fear right before walking out the door alone, what is the single best mental hack, mantra, or physical routine you use to push through that last, critical barrier?

 * Fighting the NPC Retreat: How do you force yourself to be the active participant in a low-pressure social setting (like a coffee shop or a park)? What small, tangible thing do you do to remind yourself that you are the main character of your own story?

Any specific, non-generic advice on fighting this exact mental block would be life-changing. Thank you all so much.

1nz300n,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1nz300n/creative_winters_and_how_i_deal_with_it_cycles_of/,Creative winters and how I deal with it. Cycles of self doubt and self actualization,"I have a pretentious writer rant about writers creative process and feelings. This might be informative for new writers, because now that I'm starting to get some experience I think I might of noticed something.

I think most creative professions have a creative winter. I know I do. It might just be how life is. For some people it's an unpleasant weekend that happens every so often. For most it's weeks long at least. Sometimes months or even years for the unlucky ones.

Where a dark version of ourselves creeps up from behind and starts asking us questions.

Questions like;

""Who would read this? You used the same pronoun like five times in a row. Experiencing your prose is like falling down a flight of stairs. Your characters all read the same, I just imagine the same voice when I read all of them. Thank god you clarify who is speaking at the end of each dialogue sentence.""

Creative winters aren't no joke. And they can hit like a truck if you're a new writer who doesn't know what's even happening.

Is it depression?

Sort of.

But not necessarily. I'm not depressed. But I have these low periods. At convenient times.

Tell me if this experience sounds familiar to you.

You just finished writing. You reached a milestone. 400 pages, or 10,000 reads. These milestones could be anything. For writers starting out, maybe a couple years in- it could be couple reviews. You just finished writing a significant portion of what you planned.

There's usually a crash that happens after. Where you think; ""Oh, my latest piece just performed better than anything I've ever written before it...""

And oof. It's in THAT moment, specifically... Where the dreaded 'creative winter' hits you. Where the dark version of yourself starts planting seeds of insecurity. Imposter syndrome. You start analyzing your work. Why was it received so well in comparison to your last work? Why isn't it being recieved better? Suddenly it's not good enough. Why were you ever happy about 10,000 reads? You should've aimed for 50,000 at least.

It picks your prose apart. Your ideas. Mistakes that readers of your latest work never cared enough to notice. But it's not their job to notice.

At first, I thought this was just a freak thing. Not supposed to happen. But now? Now that I've experienced this cycle a couple dozen times?

Where I work for months releasing new work until it breaks a milestone significantly further than my last milestone.

Then I crash. Burnout. And ruthlessly dressdown my work like my worst skeptic might.

Now I anticipate these seasons. This creative winter. I'm almost excited when they come. Until I'm in the middle of it of course, but when I feel the start of that downward spiral I get a masochistic feeling. Like I'm about to improve drastically as a writer. I'll go through hell to do it, but I'm setting new milestones. New standards. New rules for myself.

And for what? A little self-deprecation and self-doubt? What's a bit of imposter syndrome if I can improve even a little?

I process it by wearing cozy clothes, drinking copious amounts of coffee, and putting a strain on my relationships. Staying up late, eating unhealthy foods. Maybe I'll become an alcoholic and divorce a few times. Might do wonders for my writing career. I'm kidding about that last part obviously.

But I'm done avoiding the low points in my life. It doesn't stop them from coming. Instead I'll just do my best to make them as productive as possible. And see them as transformative periods where I look at myself and my goals through a scrutinizing lens of detail.

Am I alone in this? Has anyone else noticed this destructive cycle in creative fields? And if so how do you cope with it - if at all? In my perspective you only survive it. Then grow from it.",1,1759705633.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1.Carlin, Evan and their deductions spent another week stuck in Norris Tennessee trying to eke out content wherever they can while desperately trying to keep their most recent birth front and center headline news.  There‚Äôs been 2 pregnancy announcements and a miracle leg healing since Navy hit the ‚ÄòGram so unfortunately, she is old news.  The Stewarts will need to fly somewhere, film a speech therapy session or feign an illness to keep those numbers up.  In this family the attention train keeps moving on‚Ä¶ even before the AmEx bill starring that Prada diaper bag shows up.  We do get a Pastor Creepo sighting this week‚Ä¶ post church in a McDonald‚Äôs.  Zade is the hardest working Stewart at the moment, and he is sent to the counter at McDonald‚Äôs to order an apple pie while the new cult preacher cheers him on and Evan films the whole thing.  Of course the entire interaction is heavily subtitled and the comments pour in with folks calling him precious, cute and loving.  No Layla to be found in this one, and in fact it‚Äôs light on Layla all week.  Could she be speaking up and refusing to perform on cue?  It doesn‚Äôt matter because her replacement has arrived and they have Zade to fill the cute quota until the baby learns to crawl‚Ä¶ or hold her head up unassisted.  There are no free rides in Stewart world, and at 3 weeks old, Navy Kate is on the clock.  She films an ad for an infant pajama company and we get another shot of her in the bath promoting infant skincare products.  This week they are so bored Evan releases 2 vlogs.  The first is just a recap of his sister‚Äôs visit to meet the baby, old footage from her 2 week doctor‚Äôs visit and an ad for baby formula which Evan hawks by saying they maybe might need it, even though Carlin is exclusively breastfeeding and has no plans to supplement with formula, but for sure you should buy it.  The second vlog shows Zade attempting to play soccer again, and this week he manages to run.  They seem to think this is a monumental achievement and it seems like he spent a ton of time watching soccer videos to prepare. Evan breaks the cardinal rule of soccer parents by screaming ‚ÄúKick it, Kick it, Kick it‚Äù over and over.  The other parents try to ignore this screaming thumb hauling around a humongous camera and even Carlin moves her chair away from him. Back at home we watch Evan set up the baby‚Äôs crib in Layla‚Äôs room with lots of help from Carlin.  Layla‚Äôs room has new wallpaper and it seems as though her roommate will be joining her very soon. You know what we don‚Äôt see?  LAYLA.  This is an exciting development but doesn‚Äôt mean much because it just doubles the workload for Navy and Zade.  Gil comes over to cut some dead trees from their fence line while Evan hangs around behind him in an all-white T-Shirt and sneakers.  Gil hits a bee hive that sends Evan scurrying back into the house‚Ä¶ smooth move Gil.  They recap, repackage and replay the baby‚Äôs birth and call it ‚Äúraw and natural‚Äù.  That starts a heavy debate in their comments and the internet aunties are out in force to protect their precious Carlin.  She says this birth was healing for her after all of the complications the last time.  They head over to Zach and Whitney‚Äôs to film Whitney sick as a dog and newly pregnant.  Talk about wearing out your welcome‚Ä¶ they start the evening with Pizza Hut and stay so long they have to order Sonic.  Wonder why it‚Äôs such a chore for them to stay at home?
 
 
 
2.Harvey Clark is now an old, washed up, social security ready one year old.  He has had his moment in the sun at his first birthday party, and there‚Äôs really not much left to be excited about.  This week Katie and Travis dropped all of the details behind the big party and it easily cost $15,000.  Katie pretends to cry all week, but her face can‚Äôt really change expression any longer it seems‚Ä¶ so she just perpetually looks mildly animated.  They also drop 2 vlogs and the first one features all of the party prep.  GiGi and Pop are back in town to help with all of the hard work leading up to the big day, and Isaiah is also around to help and offer his truck for hauling things.  The big drama is that it may rain and Katie wanted the party to be outside.  Luckily their home is basically a beige warehouse so it‚Äôs not really a problem to move everything inside.  The theme is preppy rich white kid, and they nail it.  The food is catered by Olive Garden, she flies in a party planner from New Jersey and everything is her version of elegant.  Remember on the show when Katie loved the word ‚Äúbougie‚Äù?  This is what she must have been thinking.  She has plastic wine glasses and paper plates and rented tables and chairs.  Of course, this is all a business expense for them and they plan to get a week‚Äôs worth of content from it, so it makes sense.  Almost all of the Tennessee Bates show up lead by Gil and Kelly who haven‚Äôt done an ounce of work, per usual.  Katie shares all of the links including her $300 dress, Carlin‚Äôs $400 all white bounce house, and the $500 worth of stuffed bears she gave as party favors.  Too bad she didn‚Äôt spring for Rosetta Stone Scottish version so she could learn to pronounce Tartan correctly.  One more ‚ÄúturTAN‚Äù and I was going to lose it.  Yesh.  Somewhere in the mix of all of this was the baby himself‚Ä¶ but Harvey is really just a bit player.  After the big day the Clarks head to Dollywood to film all of the same things they just filmed 2 weeks ago and then it‚Äôs off to Build a Bear where they learn you have to actually show up during your child‚Äôs birthday month to receive the birthday bear deal.  No worries‚Ä¶ daddy has plenty of money. 
 
 
 
3.Josie Balka has kept a tight grip on new home content.  She made her pinterest private after it was leaked here, promised an update that never materialized, and only films tight shots of the new property.  Still though‚Ä¶ it is obviously happening because this week Trace said he has a sibling currently building a new home.  Gotta be the Balkas‚Ä¶ right??  In the meantime, she is committed to moving that camera all around her house filming herself brushing her hair, her teeth, making coffee and making out with ole eyebrows. She is still in the Jesus Gym even though it seems pretty lonely there these days and the pool noodle is still permanently in place.  She takes her followers along on another baby checkup and makes sure to film herself in the bathroom, holding her urine sample cup.  It‚Äôs the 7th anniversary of the time her parents absolutely ruined her wedding dress and to celebrate she and Kelton head off on a trip to a very ‚Äúfall‚Äù-centric place.  They are kid free on this getaway and luckily, she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about getting pregnant so perhaps she will enjoy herself.  Josie does pop up in the background of Harvey‚Äôs birthday vlog.  It‚Äôs hard to recognize her because it‚Äôs just regular Josie and not GlamBot Josie.  The one giveaway is her iPhone literally trained on top of baby Harvey for an extended amount of time.  Gotta get those shots!
 
 
 
4.Alyssa Webster lifted her mourning veil and returned to Instagram to humble brag about her trip to the Redneck Riviera and to show off all of her matching polyester blend outfits of questionable origin.  It was time for the Webster family‚Äôs yearly trip where they pack in to one house and do all of the same basic things they normally do 2 hours up the road.  She shows lots of pictures of Rhett in various hats‚Ä¶ including the one that burned down her influencer career‚Ä¶ and the girls are forced to wear the same dress in different sizes while standing stone still and plastering on a fake smile.  She thanks her number one (and only) fan, that Tikky chick for sending the girls some clothes.  Tikky has been busy because the Paine girls are also decked out in some matchy matchy this week thanks to her.  Poor woman, never gets an invitation‚Ä¶ only a lone tag.  Maybe one day Allie will show up at her doorstep because from the looks of it, the oldest Webster girl is over it.  You can see it in her eyes.  Alyssa herself continues to make up for never having gone to prom by showing up at inappropriate places in full on evening gowns.  This time she‚Äôs on the beach surrounded by bathing suits and seagulls in a flouncy floor length frock the color of‚Ä¶ skin.  She tries to snuggle up to lurch to prove they are in love but they just aren‚Äôt selling it these days. 
 
 
 
5.Is the Bates Kitchen done?  For the second week in a row, there‚Äôs no new vlog and the numbers are drivel compared to what the other Bates are bringing in.  Zach Bates in the kitchen was pure comedy gold so hopefully he can get those gross frozen meals to sponsor him for one more cheese and mayo filled episode.  I would hate for the final cook to have been a pie shell filled with cheese, potatoes, bacon and cream of chicken soup.  Whitney is suffering through the early days of pregnancy number 6 and doesn‚Äôt feel up to shilling at the level she normally does.  They do share a reel of Zach finding out she is pregnant.  We see Whitney holding a pregnancy test, and Zach fake laughing like a madman telling her that he already knew.  She pretends that there is no way he could have known‚Ä¶ who is believing this?  They have five kids and are in a fertility cult‚Ä¶ of course he knew‚Ä¶ the whole congregation knew.  Whitney holds the test like it‚Äôs a newborn kitten, petting and pawing at it and rubbing it all over her face.  That stick is the equivalent of an Oscar in fundie land and she is lavishing in its magical urine soaked possibilities.  Gross girl.  Go wash your hands.  And face. Anyway, this reel is the happiest you will ever see these people.  Procreation truly sends them into the stratosphere. Zach shares a reel making cookies with Jadon.  Jadon is the number one exploited kid right now, just like Zade is doing the heavy lifting for the Stewarts.  Management explains to them which kid will bring in the highest numbers.  Of course the cookies are for his ""pregnant wife‚Äù.  That‚Äôs her new name for 9 whole months.
 

6.Trace and Lydia join the two vlogs a week club‚Ä¶ Their first Vlog features a trip back to one of the places Lydia worked before totally committing to being a Tradwife‚Ä¶ A paint your own pottery studio.  Ryker runs around while they make small talk with the owner and paint some pieces. Afterwards they go to visit Lydia‚Äòs family who are hard at work trying to finish up a barn. The barn could be featured in Architectural Digest, and every piece is hand built by Lydia‚Äôs dad and brother‚Ä¶ Trace kicks around some sawdust and plays with a hammer so he can say he helped. Lydia has decided to focus on Maui the cat‚Ä¶ at least until Kaia is old enough to exploit more easily. Lydia puts Ryker to work filming a balance bike ad and little Kaia is expected to pull her weight by starring in an ad for pajamas.  Ryker and Maui have a spirited game of fetch and Trace is nowhere to be seen. The second vlog is a Q and A that finds the two of them sitting alone in the car.  They make a ton of excuses about why they are not leaving their tiny house anytime soon, but they do say they plan to film with Zach who will show them some properties that they have no intention of buying.  Trace does most of the talking and cuts Lydia off a lot. He says these questions really get under Lydia‚Äòs skin‚Ä¶ I wonder why‚Ä¶ she does not like people saying the baby looks like Trace because she says that is not an insult to her‚Ä¶ Were people saying it as an insult?? She makes it clear that she finds him very handsome. We know she wears glasses. Anyway Despite Trace being absent in almost all of their social media content, he is proud to say he only has one paying job and it is‚Ä¶ YouTube. That‚Äôs right this family of four is totally supporting themselves off of YouTube/influencing. Their biggest Vlog has less than 200,000 views but obviously that is not stopping them‚Ä¶ Lydia is learning from Whitney how to sling links and pay the bills. Trace says he only volunteers with the Sheriffs Department and has been for the past seven years and that everything he does for Medic Corps is also on a volunteer basis.  That leaves him plenty of time to golf, wear tights while playing fake football and hang out at the big house. Lydia is doing all of the editing of their content these days and she says it can take her up to 20 hours a week and 2 to 3 days to edit one Vlog. It certainly seems a heavy load she is carrying while Trace just does a lot of‚Ä¶ Existing. She tries to convince her followers and probably herself that she is happy and wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way. They say they will not rent a larger space because they are saving their money to buy‚Ä¶ Someone here commented that they may move in to Josie‚Äòs house and they could rent to own‚Ä¶ I guess we will see, but for now expect to see lots of content from Lydia, learning to live with less and less things while continuing to grow her family because they both are quick to say they want more children. He does briefly mention her family‚Äôs immigration issues, but only to say the standard line that they have been repeating for years now which is that they cannot talk about it. That big ass barn is clue number one that they don‚Äôt expect to go anywhere.





7. Michael Keilen is busy painting handmade Christmas ornaments to sell in her shop for the third year in a row.  She gives a sneak peek and they appear to be the same ornaments she sold last year. She and Brandon are still caring for the foster kids and Kelly was kind enough to mention them when she talked about her other grands this week.  Even though Michael said there is no adoption opportunity‚Ä¶ The boys have been with them for quite some time now.  Speaking of Kelly talking about her grandchildren‚Ä¶ She gets the honor of announcing Tori‚Äòs sixth pregnancy this week.  Once Kelly breaks the news, Tori herself comes back to show off a new family photo shoot that appears to have been taken in Florida.  One of the ‚Äúade‚Äù kids is wearing Aunt Alyssa‚Äòs sad hat‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt you just picture her handing those things out like trick-or-treat candy??  Anyway the pictures are the perfect level of cringe that we have come to expect from her‚Ä¶forced kissing and closeness with Triple B (Bad Boy Bobby), who continues to look dead behind the eyes. Of course Erin, Lawson and Michael all share Tori‚Äòs happy news.  For the Record- Tori announced babies one through four and number six. That last ‚Äúade‚Äù just slipped right through the cracks.



8.The prayers of tens of hundreds were answered this week when Saint Erin of The Rental rose up and walked again. After a solid month of being in her sick bed, she is finally able to once again control her own social media and shares the good news that she is up and moving by posting to Instagram and debuting a brand new family picture. Her favorite fundie photographer flew from Tennessee to Florida to take the sacred pictures and Superfan Tikky provided the girls with new outfits. There was much to celebrate‚Ä¶ Clothes that fit, fridge full thanks to Granny,  a happy ending to their story and a momma on her way straight back to the laundry room. You may think Erin would not be quick to celebrate Tori having baby number six so soon after delivering number five‚Ä¶ But that would mean you have forgotten who these people are‚Ä¶ Of course she is over the moon thrilled for her little sister and features lots of close-ups of baby Henry being cuddled by big brother Carles and daddy Chad.  Lawson, Michael and Kelly all share the blessed news that Erin is healed ‚Ä¶thus starting the countdown clock to baby number eight.




9.Tiffany Bates cannot decide if she wants to be an influencer who slings links, shares marriage comedy, travels, gives acting tips and behind-the-scenes views or a MAGA bigot spitting hate - so she spends another week doing a little bit of everything. Lawson is committed to being filmed with no shirt on and we see that and lots of pictures from Hawaii‚Ä¶ Of course he is also the worlds strongest man in his own mind and shows that by lifting up his pregnant wife as she is holding their toddler. They seem to have traveled from Hawaii back to California‚Ä¶ Are they in Cali for good until the baby is born or will they come home and hunker down in Tennessee? That‚Äôs one question‚Ä¶ Another is where the heck is Duke the dog?


10.Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ it has now been more than one month since the boutique has posted any new content and folks are finally paying attention‚Ä¶ There are a few comments on the last Post asking if they are going out of business‚Ä¶ this has never happened before. Will they have a final sale to liquidate or is it done forever??‚Ä¶.Kelly wishes a happy 3rd anniversary to Trace and Lydia and happy first birthday to Graham. She‚Äôs visiting with Nathan and Esther but that doesn‚Äôt stop her from saying baby Harvey is the cutest Bates baby she has ever seen. She just can‚Äôt stop with a happy first birthday - And people wonder why the siblings seem competitive‚Ä¶Kelly Joe is officially influencing! She models her skirt pants (skants?!?)& shares a link with a discount code. Of course she says no money is involved, but I‚Äôm sure they sent her a nice box full of clothing in exchange for her shoving that code down the fundie mom‚Äòs throats‚Ä¶Tiffy reshares the reel where Lawson gets fake sick as she goes into labor. She gets 2 million views and he gets lit up in the comments.


Have a great week friends and remember‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt follow any of their links during Amazon prime days!

1nz2wx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nz2wx3/tales_of_a_hotel_actech_part_three_day_1_entering/,"Tales of a Hotel AC-Tech -Part three- day 1, entering the labyrinth:","

    Sorry everyone, I just realised I had some Formating issues on the previous 2 posts, I'd really appreciate if you'd go back to read them for context. Anyway, back to my experiences.
    
    I‚Äôm not gonna lie, those were just the memorable encounters. Truth is, I‚Äôve spent hours, 
    maybe days at this point, wandering the labyrinth. Most of it‚Äôs dull. Just blank concrete, 
    dripping pipes, the occasional stack of forgotten file folders from the late '70s. It‚Äôs 
    become a place to sneak a smoke, kill time between assignments. A break room for the 
    underground. I still can‚Äôt say with certainty that every hotel I work in is connected, but 
    they all have cellars. And in each of them, there‚Äôs always a back door, or a bricked-up 
    hallway, or a half-sealed tunnel leading somewhere deeper. And more often than not, that 
    somewhere links to something else. At some point‚Ä¶ I got too used to it. It crept in slowly. 
    I caught myself marking busted machines as ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù just to finish up faster, to carve 
    out more time for exploration. I started using the labyrinth as a shortcut, to duck out and 
    grab coffee from the place I like a few streets over. And more than once, I found myself 
    just sitting in one of the vast, hollow chambers below street level, staring up at rusted 
    girders and cracked brick ceilings, soaking in the quiet beauty of the forgotten. That‚Äôs 
    when it hit me. I wasn‚Äôt okay. I put in a request to see a psychiatrist. Told HR I was 
    feeling off. Waited three months. No response. A bureaucratic loop of postponed calls and 
    ‚Äúwe‚Äôll follow up soon.‚Äù And somewhere in that waiting room silence, I started writing a 
    script in my head: No one‚Äôs going to believe this. You sound insane. You‚Äôre just tired. So 
    I canceled the appointment. 
    
    I kept my head down this week, focused hard, knocked out all my maintenance jobs by 
    Tuesday. Even managed to sweet-talk hotel management into giving me a parking permit that 
    lasts until next Monday. I think I might be about to make the biggest mistake of my life. I 
    packed my tool backpack like it was survival gear: a blanket, a few bags of jerky, a five-
    liter bottle of water, and enough batteries to outlast a blackout. Not exactly a glamorous 
    expedition, but it‚Äôs everything I might need. And no, I shouldn‚Äôt be excited. I know that. 
    No one in their right mind looks forward to spending time in the city‚Äôs underworld, in 
    places carved out for the forgotten, the outcasts, the unspoken-of. The monsters. But here 
    I am. Heart beating fast. Hands steady. Choosing to go back into the dark. 
    
    Day one:
     Today passed without incident. No whispers. No shadows moving where they 
    shouldn't. Just the labyrinth breathing its regular rhythm beneath the city, and me in step 
    with it. Down here, the dark doesn‚Äôt press, it settles. It wraps you up in something 
    thicker than air but gentler than sunlight. I‚Äôve always preferred it. Especially in summer, 
    when the sky above feels too bright, too loud. And the sounds? Mechanical. Predictable. 
    Nothing unexpected. The low spin of motors. Compressors kicking to life with their telltale 
    cough. Pipes burbling like subterranean streams. The faint electric buzz of dying 
    fluorescent tubes. Every note with a source. Nothing random. I passed through what used to 
    be a cafeteria. First sublevel, if I had to guess. The kind of place where workers once ate 
    microwave meals and pretended they had more time than they did. Everything now is yellowed 
    and cracked, but a shallow puddle still clings to the white tile floor. That‚Äôs when I saw 
    myself, reflected back in the water. For a second, I didn‚Äôt move. Didn't blink. The ripple 
    of the surface made my face shimmer and break apart. It hit me harder than it should. There 
    I stood. The same face I‚Äôd always known, now framed by an aging fluorescent reflection and 
    the worn fabric of my work overall, armor against the elements, against judgment, against 
    feeling. That puddle didn‚Äôt just mirror me, it reached somewhere deeper. Somewhere older. 
    And just like that, I was back at the indoor pool. Chlorine stinging my nose. The sharp 
    echo of wet footsteps. The blur of slides twisting overhead like colored tubing in a 
    ventilation shaft. I remember watching the other kids disappear, splashing, laughing, 
    pulled along by the noisy current of people who always seemed so comfortable belonging. Me? 
    I drifted at the edge. Not sad, exactly. Not jealous. Just‚Ä¶ out of tune. So I slipped under 
    the stairwell. Quiet. Dry. Out of sight. It wasn‚Äôt a tantrum. It wasn‚Äôt even a cry for 
    attention. It was an experiment. Would they notice I was gone? They didn‚Äôt. Not for a 
    while. Now, standing here decades later beneath the city, surrounded by silence and 
    concrete and stories that nobody upstairs would ever believe‚Ä¶ I think I finally get it. 
    Some of us were always meant for the in-between places. Not quite missing. Not quite found. 
    Just watching, and waiting, to see who notices. 
    
    I must‚Äôve crossed into the city archives without realizing it. One moment I was crawling 
    beneath a shelf, another odd passage where the floor dipped down and the air turned stale, 
    and the next I was standing in a cavernous hall lined with paper and metal and time. 
    Shelves stretched farther than my light could reach, each one sagging under the weight of 
    files that hadn‚Äôt been touched in decades. Most were stamped with years I only knew from 
    history class, 1871, 1879, neat handwriting faded to near-nothing. Paper so thin it looked 
    like it would dissolve if I exhaled too close. The air was thick with dust and‚Ä¶ something 
    older. Something like waiting. I paused for a second and let my eyes scan the rows. So many 
    folders. So much‚Ä¶ bureaucracy, maybe. Or memory. I wondered if anyone still knew what was 
    stored down here. If any of it still mattered, or if it was all just the echo of forgotten 
    decisions waiting to rot. I hadn‚Äôt planned to pass through the archive, just near it. But 
    down here, the path writes itself in strange turns. So I adjusted my pack, ducked under the 
    lowest shelves, and looked for what I knew had to be there. Sure enough, tucked beneath one 
    shelf at the edge of the room, a hatch. Bolted but loose. Just wide enough to squeeze 
    through. I dropped down into it and disappeared again, swallowed back into the twisting, 
    unknowable hallways of the labyrinth. 
    
    It felt, for the first time, like the labyrinth was speaking. Not in whispers or knocks, 
    but in what it held. In what it remembered. I started paying attention. Wiring so old it 
    might as well have been wrapped in cloth. Ventilation units stamped with 1956 in corroded 
    lettering. A room full of typewriters, silent and regal, and another stacked with boxes of 
    floppy disks like time capsules no one bothered to label. And in all of it, a kind of 
    reverence. This wasn‚Äôt just infrastructure anymore. It was the city‚Äôs memory. Layered in 
    dust and decay. Every layer of cable or pipe or rebar like a geological stratum of civic 
    ambition and eventual neglect. The cellars weren‚Äôt beneath the city, they were the city, 
    slowly forgetting itself from the ground up. But then I started noticing something else. 
    Patterns. Not just random damage, but repetition. Scratches across the concrete in parallel 
    lines. Metal beams bent not by time but by some force that clearly didn‚Äôt care they were 
    steel. Pillars crumbling in identical ways. Breaker boxes that looked like they‚Äôd been 
    clawed open by machinery. I‚Äôd seen these before, scattered and isolated. What I hadn‚Äôt 
    noticed was that they formed a path. A trail. And maybe I‚Äôve already snapped. Maybe the 
    maze finally got to me. But I‚Äôm not following it. Not yet. 
    
    That‚Äôs when I noticed the mistake. My phone battery had dropped to 26%. Not alarming, not 
    yet, but if I was going to be down here much longer, I‚Äôd need every percentage I could claw 
    back. I fished out my charger, then paused. I hadn‚Äôt seen a working outlet in over a mile. 
    No matter. I had tools. I pried open an old connector box and traced the lines. Luck was on 
    my side, 230 volts, standard alternating current, L1 to N. I clipped in the charger using a 
    pair of scavenged leads, the plastic a little brittle with age, and watched the icon blink 
    to life. Good enough. I set up camp right beneath the box, wrapped tight in my blanket like 
    an insulated pipe. I made sure to stay off the bare concrete, the cold seeps through you 
    fast when you forget to keep space between your skin and the stone. Learned that one the 
    hard way. Dinner was the usual: a strip of beef jerky, tough as a rubber gasket and nearly 
    as flavorful. Still, it fills the stomach. I tore off a second piece and tossed it into the 
    shadows, a peace offering, maybe. A snack for the rats. Or the Knockers. Or something else 
    entirely. Whatever‚Äôs out there in the dark, I‚Äôve come to respect it. Not fear it. ",1,1759705402.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
