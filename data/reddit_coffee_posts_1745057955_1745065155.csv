In 1922, he was awarded the Nobel prize and was the most famous scientist in the world.","As it happens, I have a personal connection to the Einsteins. Our two families knew each other in Berlin in the 1920s. My grandmother used to tell a story from when she was a child. One day, Albert Einstein and his wife came for dinner at the family’s apartment on Kaiserallee near the Kurfürstendamm. She recalled peering through the keyhole of the dining room door and seeing that the great scientist was wearing house slippers, confirming rumours of his forgetful nature.

After the meal, her father, Alfred Alexander, escorted Albert to the salon to take coffee, intending to quiz him about the theory of relativity. But when he climbed into bed later that night, Alfred confessed to his wife that he and his guest had become so engrossed in discussing the latest detective novels that he had forgotten to ask.

The two men also had a professional relationship. My great-grandfather was the Einstein family doctor. On 27 April 1926, Albert Einstein wrote a letter thanking my great-grandfather for the treatment he had provided to his terminally ill uncle and aunt: “Dear and esteemed Dr Alexander!” Albert said. “Words cannot express the good you have done for my family.” Having detailed the specifics of the treatment, he ended with a sentence that imagined a tactile link between the two families: “Clasping your hand in sincere gratitude, A Einstein.” “ - Thomas Harding, The Guardian

I wakeup feeling usually ok, I get ready, eat breakfast and go to work. 1-2 hours after getting to work it feels like my nervous system is on edge physically not mentally. Gradually it gets worse and worse until it gets really bad and I am shaky. After eating lunch and drinking electrolytes it gradually gets better and then I feel better than what I felt in the morning, although worn out from dealing with the first half of the day. I am so frustrated because I cant figure out what else I can do. I cant drink electrolytes first thing in morning because it makes me feel shaky also. I already take magnesium, vitamin D. 

I am diagnosed with some form of dysautonomia but dr isnt sure what, its not pots and all my drs can’t really pinpoint the cause of my symptoms. During my symptoms its not a sugar thing, I’ve checked that often. My breakfast is balanced with protein and small portion carbs. I dont drink coffee/caffeine because I cant. 

On weekends this isn’t as much of an issue, it feels like it’s whenever I have to be busy and use my brain like at work. 

I need suggestions on what supplements to try. I think I am looking for something to relax an overactive nervous system. Again it’s not really my mind because I am not stressing it’s something happening to my body. 

Another puzzle piece- I take fiber powder because it helps with my stomach issues. I feel like the fiber helps stop my digestive system from being overactive.

1k2uret,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k2uret/why_should_you_consider_the_antarctic_star_hzb15n/,Why Should You Consider the Antarctic Star HZB-15N Ice Maker Review?,"The Antarctic Star HZB-15N ice maker has been my latest kitchen gadget experiment, and it genuinely surprised me in both performance and design. This countertop ice maker makes a bold promise—producing up to 34 pounds of nugget, chewable ice daily—and I’ve been running it nearly nonstop to see if it lives up to the hype. As a self-declared fanatic of iced coffee and fizzy drinks, I rarely leave my glass without ice. Naturally, I wanted to see if this machine could keep up with my perpetually thirsty household.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact and modern look caught my eye straight out of the box. With dimensions of just 11.81 x 9.06 x 12.99 inches and a minimal stainless-steel black finish, it seamlessly fits on my countertop without dominating the space. Weighing in at 22 pounds, it’s lightweight enough to move around, although I’ve mostly left it stationed beside my coffee setup. The water tank can hold 1.1 liters, which feels pretty generous for compact ice machines. I especially liked the transparent lid, which made watching the ice production process oddly satisfying—yes, I’m that sort of person who finds ice making fascinating.

[Check Antarctic Star HZB-15N price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0bzy1lqzy/)

**Performance During Heavy Use**  
I have to admit, I was skeptical about its ability to make 34 pounds of ice in 24 hours, but it came surprisingly close. The speed at which it churns out ice amazed me. It starts producing ice in about 10-15 minutes after setup—no long waiting times, which was crucial when hosting gatherings. The nugget ice it creates is light, chewable, and perfectly suited for cocktails, sodas, or just a simple glass of iced water. What makes this even better is the consistency; I’ve yet to encounter a batch that wasn’t up to par, and the ice melts slower than the usual cubes from store-bought bags. 

**Key Benefits**  
- Produces approximately 34 pounds of soft, chewable nugget ice daily.  
- Transparent lid allows monitoring of the ice-making process—no guesswork needed!  
- One-button operation ensures ease of use for everyone in the household.  
- Compact and portable, requiring minimal counter space.  

**Flaws**  
- The storage basket isn’t insulated, so the ice starts melting if left untouched for too long.  
- It’s not the quietest machine; there’s a low hum while it runs, though not loud enough to disrupt a conversation.  
- Refilling the water manually can get repetitive with heavy use.  

**Features That Stand Out**  
What sets this apart from conventional ice makers is the one-button self-cleaning function. With just a 5-second press, the machine initiates a 15-minute deep-clean cycle, which helps prevent any buildup. I ran the self-cleaning feature before its first use, and it's been a regular routine afterward to ensure no funky tastes creep into my ice. Another underrated element is the indicator lights. The machine flashes for status updates—whether the water tank needs refilling or the basket is full—and it does so in an intuitive, non-intrusive way. It’s user-friendly enough that even my technology-averse father figured it out without needing to call me. 

**Competing Products**  
Compared to similar products like the GE Opal 2.0 Nugget Ice Maker, the Antarctic Star HZB-15N is more budget-friendly and equally efficient in ice production. While the Opal tends to have a slightly higher storage capacity and fancier app-controlled features, this machine prioritizes simplicity and compactness, ideal for those who value ease of use and portability. Another competitor is the NewAir Nugget Ice Maker, which also produces soft nugget ice but comes with a higher price tag and occupies more counter space. What I noticed is that this particular ice maker balances efficiency and a manageable footprint—perfect for medium-sized households or office setups.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This ice maker strikes an excellent balance between cost and capabilities. Machines offering similar features often land at a significantly higher price point. Considering its reliable performance, sleek design, and thoughtful features like self-cleaning, I’d say it's worth every penny. While it isn’t the most technologically advanced nugget ice maker on the market, it does exactly what it promises without over-complicating things.

I’ve been really trying to eat healthier, stay fit, and do it safely. My question is how many calories should I really be eating in a day?

I’m 24, 5’1”, and vary between 100-103 lbs. I normally don’t eat breakfast besides a muffin/small snack and a coffee. I’ll have a lunch (sometimes healthy, sometimes chick fil a/ fast food), and then I’ll have a larger dinner (I cook, so I always try and make a protein and veggies as a side with either a potato/rice/noodle base)

I’d say I normally get 1,300-1,800 calories a day, depending on how busy I am/how my body feels. Sometimes I eat more than what I described, sometimes I’ll eat less. I just listen to what my body tells me I need in the moment. I’ll have snacks if I need to and I don’t shy away from sweets or a soda here and there. 

I’ve been doing research online and have been getting frustrated with the conflicting information I’m getting. Some sources say my calorie intake is almost disordered and I’m unheathy, others say it’s fine.

1k2ugx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1k2ugx2/is_itgone/,Is it...gone?,"Has anyone had resolution of their chronic gastritis without major intervention/lifestyle change? I think mine may have healed itself but im not sure and don't wanna give myself false hope, but here's my story...

I became sick in September 2023. Chronic bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Couldn't eat more than 3 bites without it coming up. 

Endoscopy in February 2024 diagnosed me with chronic mild gastritis with vascular  congestion and folveolar hyperplasia. Basically my stomach was angry and swollen inside. They prescribed me PPIs and sent me on my way. 

I took the PPIs for about 6 months before stopping them. I had alleviation but not complete resolution of symptoms during that time. I never changed my diet, I really struggle with willpower. So I kept eating spicy food, fast food, caffiene, sugar, occasional alcohol. One change i did make was switching from coffee to green tea. I also continued to smoke pot daily, which really helps symptoms but is not supposed to be healing. 

Today, and for months now, I have not had symptoms of gastritis. I thought it still had it until recently because I was becoming very nauseated every morning and often vomiting. But since quitting excess snacking before bed my morning sickness went away....and that leaves me wondering, when did my gastritis go away? 

...or did it? Is it possible for symptoms to disappear for a bit but it's just in a latent phase? 

The only other thing I can think of is that I take antidepressants and anti anxiety meds now, started early this year. My anxiety is still ever-present, but maybe taking the edge off my negative mental state has helped? I was very highstrung and on edge before psychiatric treatment, lots of mood swings. Maybe my mental state was the cause all along and now that I've addressed it, problem solved? 

I really wanna hope its gone for good, but cant help but be suspicious. I know it usually takes a lot of work to actually heal it. Has anyone else had an experience like this? ",3,1745063362.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

1k2uguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k2uguy/advice_needed_on_troubles_with_my_23m_girlfriend/,Advice needed on troubles with my (23M) girlfriend (20F),"Hello, I 23/M have been with my girlfriend 20/F for 1 year and a bit. For context, I actually fell for her way before she did, we met through a close friend and developed a friendship. I started to catch feelings a few months into knowing her. I confessed my feelings and she rejected me...twice. The first time, she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, and didn't see me that way. Although it hurt, I accepted it and tried to move on. However, we were in the same friendgroup and imo she continued to interact with me above and beyond how a female friend should act, and something told me she had some sort of feelings for me. We would text for hours a day and video call till 2am. I'm still trying to get over her as this is happening. One night we go out as a group and get drunk, and we end up holding hands and dancing and everyone sees something is there. The next day I have a talk with her again about why she's acting like this, I clearly have feelings for her, but she was acting like she also had feelings even though she denied them. Again for the 2nd time she rejected me. This same pattern continued for months, till it got to a point where it was really so confusing and I had to talk with her a 3rd time, and this time she finally admitted she had feelings, and wanted to give things a try. We've been together from that day since. She's been very loving and caring, and we had a great summer together, I remember that time really fondly. 

Lately, I've been feeling frustrated with her. I feel she's changed, become a bit more selfish and stubborn. And we get into lots of arguments because of this. This may be partly because she's in her final year of uni and is stressed but at the same time I don't feel its right for her to be doing certain things. Even though I initially was madly in love with her, I feel I'm losing feelings because of constant disappointments. We both have our issues, I come from a very traumatic childhood so I may have some issues that come up in arguments, but I also feel she has alot of issues too, and its so exhausting to deal with. 

From what I can tell from the biggest arguments we've had, she has trouble with empathy I think, she doesn't realise what others go through. Imo she has major communication issues, she misunderstands alot of what I say, and I don't feel heard a lot of the time, its a if she's in her own bubble, and then blames me or others for not communicating enough.

Let me give an example, one day there was a big event in town for winter celebrations. I and my housemates live a bit further away and she lives in town. Since it was going to be busy, I decided to take the bus to avoid the headache of parking. I messaged her this and we agreed to meet in town 30 mins before the celebrations started, so we could be together at the stroke of the hour. When me and my housemates tried taking the bus down, for some reason the bus was dealyed or cancelled. We instead decided to take the train which would take slightly longer. We ended up getting there at 10 minutes to. I hadn't had the opportunity to call or message her because we were walking in the pouring rain in order to get to the train, and then from the train into town, I texted her as I got off the train saying I'd just gotten off, it would take about 15 mins to walk to where she was. She opened the text but didn't reply to me. I called her several times to ask her where she was so I could meet her. She ignored my calls, clearly she was annoyed I was late. I finally spotted her in a coffee shop by chance and asked why she hadn't picked up, she admitted she was annoyed at me. We ended up not being together at the official start of the celebrations (which is meant to be a romantic thing to share with your partner) all because she was annoyed that I wasn't there at the specified time (half past) and because I took too long inform her, even though it wasn't that long imo. We got into a huge fight about that, I was upset and disappointed she was so hung up on the time that she wasn't even there with me at the time and it pissed me off she was so inflexible and rigid all the time.

More recently, we've had two big arguments within the span of a week. Last week I needed her help with organising some clothes in my room, which she had wanted to help me do for a while now. I finally had the urge to do it that day and asked her if she could come over later to help. She said she'd see if she could but she was working on her deadline. Which I totally get ofc, she's doing her final works now, he last one is in a few days. She also offers for me to come round to hers so she could help me with that, so she wouldn't be away from her computer for long. I decline and say its better I stay home and do it. 

Later on in the day, must've been around 8pm, I wonder if she'd be free now, and I call her. It turns out she was out at dinner spur of the moment with her housemates. I felt kind of annoyed for several reasons: One, I had asked for help and she gave the excuse of work, but then decides to ignore that and just go out instead. Two, she always complains to me about not having enough money and sometimes refuses or is reluctant to take the bus up to see me when sometimes I can't pick her up (I work full time, long hours, sometimes till 11-12 at night). And yet she has the money to go out to dinner with her housemates on that day AND two days prior to the same pizza place with her course friends (keep in mind this is an expensive pizza place). Just to be clear, I have no problem with her being out with friends, but in this instance with the circumstances mentioned, I felt ignored and hurt. 

I called her out on this and she gave the excuse ""Oh I didn't realise you wanted it done today"" and ""I was trying to please two different sides, I couldn't help it"". Imo she admits she was juggling two commitments one with me and one with housemates and decided to take the more fun option, and also didn't fancy taking the bus up. Also keep in mind my commitment was made first, the flatmate thing was literally spur of the moment. For context she regularly complains that she doesn't like taking the bus up to mine because its expensive and she doesn't like lugging things on it, even though its at most 10-12 mins, less with no traffic, and the bus stop is literally infront of my front door. She regularly makes me drive her home because of this even when I have to drive to work, and I've nearly been late to work because of that once (I work for an app based delivery company and if you're late by as little as 5 mins, you get your shift cancelled).
Anyway, we got into an argument and I didn't want to see her for the next few days, and she ended up breaking down and wanting to see me so she came by taxi at 12 at night.

The more recent argument Last night I was working till 12 midnight in a town 40 mins away from where I live and she texts me asking if I wanted to stay over tonight. Keep in mind this weekend is the final push for her deadlines and we had agreed to stay at our own places till she had submitted everything. She says her flatmates are all gone for Easter and she's lonely and misses me. I tell her I couldn't stay the night because I had to prepare for work the next day and I'd be finishing late tonight, but I offered to pick her up and have her stay at mine (which is a detour from my drive home). She said she'd rather not because she wanted to get work done the next morning. This annoyed me because it seems when it suits her she asks for me to come over regardless of the consequences for me. Even if I had stayed over she'd still need breakfast and she'd still want some time in the morning to cuddle as she likes to do (well so do I ofc). My stance was that she could do that at mine and stay overnight if she wanted to see me, we could have breakfast the next day together, and she could take the bus home (which she hates doing as said before). She also can work from anywhere with her laptop, I can't get ready and cook my food etc for work anywhere, I need to be at mine. That's the difference for me. But as long as I make the effort, she wants to see me. The minute it inconveniences her, she suddenly doesn't want to. ""Oh Im too tired and I want my own bed tonight"" ""I need to get work done tomorrow"". I asked her, has she thought about if I'm tired from working for 10h straight that day and may have wanted my own bed that night too?  No part of staying over the night prevents her from doing work the next day, she could literally leave before I wake up to go home and work if she really wanted to, but I just feel she just doesn't take my circumstances into account. If she needed to work on her deadline, don't ask me to come round, if she wanted to see me, don't complain you need to do work the next day, you can't have it both ways! We got into that argument and we're not speaking, I told her to message me after she submits her deadline so we can talk. 

Even though we have a lot of love for eachother and care about what happens to eachother, I just feel she has two sides to her, the loving carefree giggly girlfriend and the girlfriend stuck in her ways, rigid, stubborn, inflexbile girlfriend, and I just really dislike and can't stand her negative side sometimes. And this doesn't just happen when she's got a deadline, it happens intermittently all the time. When she gets an idea into her head, she doesn't change, doesn't compromise or see reason. I'm worried if we're actually right for one another after all this. There's obviously so much more to this but everytime she disappoints me like this, I'm so exhausted from dealing with this. I need advice. On the one hand I really love her and we've talked about being long term, kids, marriage etc, but I just can't handle her negatives, or I don't think I can anymore. Our bond is really intense, but so are our arguments and its making me wonder whether we should part ways or not. What are your thoughts? Anything would be appreciated, even if you believe I'm wrong I atleast want some light shed on this. Thanks in advance.

TL:DR

1k2ugim,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RoundSolid2796/comments/1k2ugim/the_postit_mystery/,"""The Post-it Mystery"""," In a buzzing marketing firm in Mumbai, there was a guy named Aarav — quiet, creative, the kind of person who spoke more through his designs than words. Then there was Meera — vibrant, smart, always surrounded by people, the heartbeat of the floor.

They worked on the same team but had never really spoken beyond the usual, “Hey, can you send that file?”  
Until one day, Meera found a bright yellow Post-it on her desk. It read:

**“You light up the office in ways you don’t realize.”**

No name. No clue.

Thinking it was a prank, she ignored it. But the next day, another note appeared:

**“You’re the calm in this stormy place. Ever noticed how the plants on your desk grow faster?”**

Creeped out? A bit. Curious? Definitely.

The notes kept coming — some funny, some deep, all oddly observant. And always anonymous.

So Meera decided to play detective. She narrowed it down to five people, including Aarav, the silent designer who always wore headphones and carried a sketchbook like it was part of his body.

To test her theory, she wrote a message back and stuck it under her keyboard:  
**“Why the mystery? Why not just say hello?”**

No response.

But the next morning, there was a note on her *coffee cup*:

**“Hello :) Some things are more beautiful in mystery.”**

She started to enjoy the game. The back-and-forth continued. Little did she know, each note from her inspired Aarav’s designs — campaign ideas, color palettes, mood boards. She had become his creative muse.

One evening, after a client presentation, Aarav left his sketchbook behind by accident. Meera, being the last one to leave, picked it up to return it. And as she flipped through the pages... her breath caught.

There were drawings of her candid moments. Laughing with the team. Talking to the plants. Sipping coffee.

She turned to the last page. A note scribbled in bold:

**“Maybe tomorrow, I’ll finally say it in person.”**

The next morning, he was waiting at her desk, no Post-it this time.

Just a smile and a simple, “Hey Meera… I’m Aarav.”",1,1745063317.0,u_RoundSolid2796,0,1.0,False

1k2ucx5,https://i.redd.it/8gdykj114sve1.jpeg,Someone gave me a sample of the poop beans,"… and I’m not impressed. I have no idea how old they are. The person that gave them to me said they got them in Feb 2025. They are a very dark roast, but also low density. I use a hand grinder and it took a lot less effort to grind these than my regular roast. Pulling the shot I could see no crema. None. Very flat brew and it went quick as well. I can’t be bothered changing my grind size for these, I don’t think it will be worth it.

Also: there is a lot of fake poop coffee out there because it can be sold for hundreds of dollars per kilo, so there is no guarantee this was the real deal. 

First impressions of the aroma: tar. There was a faint hint of fresh, hot tar!

On tasting (I did my usual flat white) - an OK coffee, with a little licorice or anise.

After some time, we ended up having a video call, but she never wanted to turn her camera on — she always used the excuse that her hair was messy. Eventually, she told me (according to her) that she had autism.

Most of our conversations felt pretty one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled last minute, saying she had hurt her leg. After she told me about her autism, she often claimed I was treating her differently.

She opened up about her past, telling me her ex had left her, and that another guy she had been seeing replaced her not long after. I remember one day I got mugged and nearly lost her number — oddly enough, she barely reacted and told me she wouldn’t text unless I messaged first.

She used to talk about her cats all the time, and she mentioned her nephews were also autistic. I recall she once got really mad when her cousin brought up the fact she used to drink with her ex.

At one point, I invited her to go to the movies, since she was always saying we never went out. She refused at first, saying she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed. The very next day, she asked me: “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?”

Still, we ended up going to the movies. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and later spent the afternoon cuddling. She never let me check her phone, always stayed distant, and only shared her Instagram with me after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me some chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. Once there, she said she was feeling too embarrassed and asked to keep the lights off. I said it was fine, but her mood shifted completely and she became defensive.

Before that, we had spent an afternoon kissing at the park, and when it was time for her to leave, I offered to walk her home. It always felt like she was avoiding introducing me to her family. I walked her back and left.

On another occasion, her sister dropped her off at my place. I mentioned we didn’t go out much because she was always making excuses, and she got really mad at me for saying that.

One day, we were gaming together, and I criticized the game — she got upset and stopped playing. Later, she brought me chocolate, we hung out for a while, and soon after she brought up the idea of breaking up.

She once invited me to a party, but later said she wasn’t going anymore, only to change her mind at the last minute. I got annoyed and asked if she even wanted me to go with her. I told her I’d go, and asked if I could arrive a bit earlier, but she made it clear I should only show up at 6 PM.

I went earlier anyway. Her sister saw me on the street and invited me upstairs. Later we went to her friend’s party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, she looked at me and said, “Should we download an app to find a hot girl for you?”

After the party, we went back to her place. She asked me to stay the night, but I ended up leaving.

After all these situations, I called her and ended things. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had pushed her into therapy and that I had stolen her happiness.

Even so, she texted me later, saying she missed me more than she expected. We started talking again. One day, while we were still talking, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she claimed she was actually looking for her friend’s ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She said the feeling would pass and told me she had gone somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called and invited me to her mother’s birthday party, but I didn’t go. Her mother even called me, asking if I loved her. Later, her mom invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, and she told me her father was extremely mad at me. I felt awful and ended up venting about it online. She found out, confronted me, and said I had lied to and used her — that her behavior was all because of her insecurities and autism — and that she had prayed for me every single day. After that, she blocked me and disappeared.

Yesterday Guy met up with the district superintendent and some of his former colleagues at the school District. He is so happy that the community-based education initiative is still continuing. They invited him to an “exhibition” at the end of May where classes will present their projects. Also, the superintendent invited him to attend as a guest of the district a special [conference](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:0631f5c8-113d-431f-b3bf-b05edd800975) for young principals about special education.

They also talked about Lori and some of her challenges. I am not going to delve into details, but we will have our challenges if we move forward with our plan. The superintendent urged Guy to build a bridge to the district’s Committee of Special Education which serves private as well as public school children.

Returning to Ikeda Sensei’s lecture on *The Opening of the Eyes,* today I am completing the [Standing Up Alone Based on a Vow](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/a-vow-forthe-enlightenment-of-all-people-the-power-deep-within-our-lives-that-can-overcome-all-obstacles/) section. Sensei now looks at three examples of the nine easy acts the Daishonin uses. What does Nichiren think of his own chances of success? 

>He stresses that he is an ordinary mortal, describing himself as a person “of paltry strength,” “lacking in supernatural powers” and “without wisdom” (WND-1, 239). 

Very much like me.

>What he wishes to communicate is that even if one should lack physical strength, supernatural powers or wisdom, a person who cherishes a strong vow or commitment to propagate the Law and advances together with the Buddha will be filled with infinite strength, courage and wisdom and can overcome even the most daunting obstacles. That is the message of boundless hope implicit in his words. 

That is crazy, pure crazy. Our discussion meeting is tomorrow. With the sick out at the Daycare, we faced a stress test. Yes, we made it through, but The Mamas and Papas are exhausted. What? Plug up the holes in the meeting plan? When? Check in with Emily Veera, John, and Jack? Who? Remind members about the meeting? 

And today will be crazy also.

Sudden accident. We were together for six years. I was shattered. I don’t have much family, but my older brother (31M) helped me through a lot of the early grief. Or at least, I thought he did.

My fiancé was cremated, and I kept his urn in a wooden box on a shelf in my apartment. Nothing flashy. Just private. Personal. A part of him still with me.

Fast forward: my brother gets engaged. His fiancée and I never got along. She always made passive comments about how I ""still acted like I was married."" Once she even joked that “dating me must be like competing with a ghost.” I told my brother it bothered me. He said she was just awkward with grief and I should let it go.

About six months ago, they stayed over at my place for a weekend. I was out one morning running errands while they were alone in the apartment.

When I got back, the urn was gone.

I freaked out. I tore the place apart thinking it had fallen or been moved. My brother finally admitted that his fiancée “accidentally knocked it over” and that the ashes “spilled” so they “just threw the rest out.” Like it was broken glass or old coffee grounds.

They threw away my fiancé. Without even calling me.

I went silent. Dead silent. I told them both to get out and haven’t spoken to either of them since.

Now the wedding’s in two weeks. I’ve been getting texts from my brother, my mom, even extended family saying I need to be there. That “life is short” and “family is everything.”

But every time I think about sitting at that wedding, smiling politely, while the woman who literally discarded the last piece of the person I loved is in a white dress… I feel physically sick.

I told my brother I won’t be coming. He said I’m being cold. That it was “just ashes” and I’m choosing a dead man over my living family.

So… AITA for refusing to go?

 ## Core Benefits

The Body Glove water filter provides numerous benefits that enhance the quality of your drinking water and improve your overall well-being.

**Improved Water Quality**

The Body Glove water filter significantly improves the quality of your drinking water by removing contaminants that can affect its taste, odor, and safety. This includes chlorine, lead, sediment, and other impurities that can be present in municipal water supplies. By removing these contaminants, the filter provides you with water that is cleaner, fresher, and healthier.

**Enhanced Taste and Odor**

By removing chlorine and other chemicals from your water, the Body Glove water filter enhances its taste and odor. Filtered water tastes cleaner and more refreshing, making it more enjoyable to drink. This can also improve the taste of coffee, tea, and other beverages made with filtered water.

**Protection Against Harmful Contaminants**

The Body Glove water filter provides protection against harmful contaminants that can pose a risk to your health. This includes lead, cysts, and other microorganisms that can be present in water supplies. By removing these contaminants, the filter helps to ensure that you are consuming water that is safe and free from harmful substances.

**Cost Savings**

Using a Body Glove water filter can save you money on bottled water. Instead of purchasing bottled water, you can simply filter your own water at home, saving money and reducing plastic waste. The cost of the filter and replacement cartridges is typically much lower than the cost of buying bottled water over the long term.

**Environmental Friendliness**

By reducing your reliance on bottled water, the Body Glove water filter contributes to environmental sustainability. Bottled water production and transportation consume significant amounts of energy and resources, and plastic bottles often end up in landfills or oceans. Using a water filter helps to reduce your environmental footprint and promote a more sustainable lifestyle.

This week, I’m exploring the rich, spice-laden cuisine of YEMEN 🇾🇪 with SIFRATNA by Amjaad Al Hussain. Yemeni food is a reflection of the country’s deep cultural heritage, shaped by ancient spice routes and centuries of tradition. From the slow-cooked stews of the highlands to the seafood dishes of the coastal regions, this cuisine is bold, aromatic, and deeply comforting. SIFRATNA brings Yemen’s culinary traditions to life with beautifully detailed recipes and stories that highlight the warmth and hospitality at the heart of Yemeni cooking.

On the menu: fragrant fahsa with hilbeh (slow-cooked meat stew with fenugreek), crispy malawach, buttery khaliat al nahl (honeycomb bread), rich mandi rice, and aromatic spiced Yemeni coffee.

[Pic 2](https://ibb.co/r80NcHZ)

I adapted an easy no-cook marshmallow recipe to make these, and they turned out great! Apart from heating the water and gelatin in the microwave, this recipe doesn't involve cooking.

**RECIPE:**  
2 Tbsp Gelatine  
1/4 Cup Boiled Water  
1/4 Cup Cold Water  
3/4 Cup Sweetener of choice (or 1 Cup Allulose)  
1 Tsp Vanilla Extract  
Desiccated Coconut  

**INSTRUCTIONS:**  
Put the freshly boiled water and sweetener in the bowl of a benchtop mixer and mix on high for 5 minutes. It doesn't sound like it would do anything, but it helps the sweetener dissolve.

Mix the gelatin and cold water in a microwave safe jug and microwave on high for 60 seconds. Stir to make sure the gelatin is dissolved.

Add the hot gelatin mix to the mixer and beat until thick and glossy.

Spray moulds with a light coating of olive oil and quickly fill with marshmallow before it sets, **OR** line a tray with baking paper, spray with oil, pour the marshmallow in and flatten with a knife.

It should set within an hour. Carefully remove the bunnies from moulds and roll in coconut. Add eyes with a toothpick and some red food colouring (I didn't have any, so I used instant coffee). **OR** take the marshmallow out of the lined tray, cut into squares with an oiled knife and roll in coconut.

I like marshmallow with toasted coconut, and the easiest way to do this is to pour some desiccated coconut in a foil-lined tray and stick it under the grill. Stir frequently and don't take your eyes off it - it burns very suddenly. When it looks golden brown it's done, but let it cool before rolling marshmallow in it or the marshmallow will melt.

This is a great recipe for kids because it doesn't involve boiling hot sugar in a saucepan on the stove.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I'm new to allulose and I'm actually finding it bitter, which I think is a 'me' problem. So these bunnies were not entirely successful from that perspective. But the texture is spot on. I'll try again with a different sweetener some time.",3,1745060898.0,ketoaustralia,0,0.8,False

<div>### Creative &amp; Confident Approaches to Meet Women IRL

Meeting women IRL (in real life) offers an authentic experience that goes beyond the typical bar scene. For those seeking genuine connections, embracing creative and confident approaches can spark memorable interactions in everyday environments. Whether at coffee shops, bookstores, community events, or outdoor activities, these settings provide natural conversation starters that foster meaningful exchanges.

### Choose Unique Social Settings

Branching out from crowded nightlife spots can increase your chances of meeting women who share your interests. Consider engaging in hobbies like art classes, sports leagues, or volunteering groups. These environments encourage relaxed and organic interactions, helping you connect on deeper levels without the distractions of loud bars. Plus, meeting women through shared passions naturally builds rapport and confidence.

### Confidence and Authenticity Make the Difference

When aiming to meet women IRL, confidence paired with genuine authenticity is key. Approach conversations with curiosity rather than a rehearsed script. Showing interest in her opinions or experiences helps create a comfortable atmosphere. Confident body language—like maintaining eye contact and smiling—can also signal openness and approachability, increasing your chances of engaging effectively.

### Practical Tips to Enhance Your Success

- Focus on active listening to show you value her perspective.
- Use situational observations as natural icebreakers.
- Be mindful of social cues to respect her comfort level.
- Maintain a relaxed posture to convey ease and friendliness.
 
By stepping outside the bar scene and adopting creative, confident techniques, meeting women IRL becomes an enriching experience. Prioritizing authenticity and shared environments ensures connections that are both meaningful and lasting.

1k2tmhv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k2tmhv,Road trip pennies so far,"I’m part way through my Florida to Alaska journey, this is what I’ve collected so far. 
If you don’t want to read through a long, potentially boring story all about Pennies you can stop reading here. 

So, I went through my whole big bag of coins and picked out all the pre 1982 copper Pennies just to use for these. I had probably 30. Then I start my trip and can only find the left over bag with every coin but the copper Pennies. So I completely screwed myself basically. So after the Dallas and Texas pennies I decide to start paying for things with cash, because maybe I’ll happen to get copper Pennys back. And I did! Twice I paid with cash and twice my change included a copper penny. So now I’m like ok I’m a genius I’m just going to go ask a clerk for 10 pennies in exchange for a dime. Surely there will be one or two in the 10. No. And I did that 2 more times at two different places. No. It’s like the penny gods where reminding me that I can’t manipulate fate. So now I have 30 new zinc Pennys. Yay. So whatever, I give up on the copper thing. 

What do we think about having a penny from somewhere we didn’t actually go? I got to the petrified forest gift shop in Arizona and use the penny machine, planning on heading into the park right after. I get up to the gate and it’s $25 to enter?? I mean I could understand $10. But 25? I don’t even actually know what this place is (if it’s actually really cool don’t tell me). I’m driving from Florida to Alaska for crying out loud I can’t afford $25 to get into some random park. So I feel like a poser for that one.

 By this point I’m tired and hungry and trying to get to Sedona before sunset. I hadn’t eaten all day because I was craving vegetables after having not had one in days. So the plan was to stop at the Whole Foods salad bar in flagstaff. On the way to flagstaff is Winslow. Apparently it’s famous because of some eagles song about standing on a corner and taking it easy in Winslow or something. I don’t know exactly. So there’s a penny machine there but at this point I’m questioning if it’s worth the stop because I really just want to get to Whole Foods as fast as possible. I decide it is, I pull up extremely fast to aforementioned famous “corner” that this machine is on and I only take a second to look around. Literally the only reason anyone is visiting this town is because of this song. It’s the towns whole personality. People are taking pictures on the “corner” non stop. Anyways I decide to use my last copper penny, crank the machine and it comes out TERRIBLY. Like you can’t even see the design…..ok, great use for my last copper penny. So I get a zinc penny and get a different design. SMH. 

I don’t even check to see if flagstaff has a penny machine, it probably does. I don’t care at this point I just want food and to get to Sedona in time to have a drink with a view. I get to Sedona at a good time, maybe 6pm (btw the drive from flagstaff to Sedona was the most jaw droppingly beautiful drive of my life). I find a Sedona machine and thought it was funny they have a sign telling people only to use new shiny pennies not old dirty ones. And in the example the “dirty” one looks like a decently clean 1960 something penny. 

So eventually I’m leaving Arizona and on my way towards Utah, I stop at a gas station and buy a cup of coffee. It’s $2.16. Perfect. I’ll get 4 Pennie’s back. So I hand her $3. She takes it and says “wow I can’t believe you don’t have 16 cents”. First of all…how is that so unbelievable? Second of all…it’s like she had x-ray vision and could see into my purse where there was in fact a huge bag of coins. I laugh and say i actually need change, she gives me a blank look and hands me back 85 cents. Yes, 85 cents. When it should be 84!!! I think she thought she was doing me a favor by giving me a nickel instead of four Pennies. Thanks I guess. 

Anyways I’ll stop there for now. I’m currently in the back of my car at a loves truck stop unable to fall back asleep, mainly because I didn’t really think about how cold it gets here in Montana at night. Hoping writing all this out has tired me. I think I’ll go buy a bigger blanket tomorrow. ",7,1745060102.0,pressedpenny,0,1.0,False

We both had appointments most of the day Thursday and we each took turns watching the kids... I was really hangry all day I had no money in my account to do anything... my partner and I finished our appointments and drove to a bank wherein I had no idea he was about to go in and spend another damn nearly 2 hours at leaving myself and kids in the car... like wtf? We had other things to do! I am tending to the kids meanwhile just listening to music taking my 4 yr old to go pew things of that nature... I wait and wait finally he emerges. I say let's go home I have to use the bathroom and 4yr old has to poop. So we get home I go to the bathroom and so does 4yr old. We go back to the car and I tell him ""hey we need to go to the mailbox"" so we load up and go on our merry way but the entire drive he is going on and on about having to pick my son up from school (my child from another father previously) something he does all the time in fact. He hates my ex and id like to say he hates my child too... I just grey rock method him to the best of my ability... he likes to point blame at my child when my partner is the one who is always late and never wants to move until late into the day but this day he had to be up early for an appointment but decided to add a bank run that we never planned to do and took almost 2 hours to do so it's late in the day nearly 5 pm by the time we leave the mall box. The entire drive to my son's school he's talking about how he's regretting opening the new account and he's going to cancel it after wasting 2 hours to open it. We have to pick my son up and then go to my sister in laws. We get there and he's just being really rude to me like giving me a cold shoulder and saying he hates his life... I am watching the kids play in my SILs house my mom comes over there to bring her grandkids their Easter baskets he and my mom DO NOT LIKE EACHOTHER (another story for another time) so i am talking away feeding the kids dinner and whatnot the kids are running through the house having a grand time but at one point my 4yr old ran into a table and hurt himself a little I am trying to get up to go to him my mom is talking and my SIL is too I see a knife on top of the counter a little too close to the edge so I am a little ADD and I had to grab it to put it in the sink away from our toddlers and as I am doing so my partner comes in and is like why aren't you going? Once I moved the knife I was able to go get my child to see if he was okay, (I get a lot of side quests my bad) as I was walking over there he told me to just go back and visit that he will do it himself since I was too busy to watch the kids. I was pissed off because I was tending to him I just got a bit off course. But anyways I say it out loud that I'm frustrated with the way he spoke to me and moved on. The night did not go well. The kids were being loud and playing so we decided it was time to wrap up and go home... I see my partner grabbing our diaper bag towards the door (keep this in mind) I get the kids ready to go and I walk each of them to the car by myself. We have 4 of them. I take all the kids say goodbye to my mom and bye to my SIL and we leave  he tells me how mad he is about my mom asking to leave the kids with her when we do errands so she can visit her grandbabies. (Story for later) he keeps going on about being frustrated with the bank and my mother. My partner wants me to stop at a drugstore to get nicotine patches or whatever I realize then I did not have my diaper bag which had my wallet... I ask him where he put the bag he said he never grabbed it... I tell him ""yes you did I watched you pick it up and walk with it"" he said nope you can grab your own shit that was yours to grab... I again told him I didn't think to check because I had taken the kids to the car myself and I seen him with the bag. So he goes on and on about how I need to drive back right now and get it but my SIL is in bed but she was willing to wait up so I wanted to get it and he said no don't worry about it tonight just get it tomorrow ok... so I call her back and say I will get it in the morning just to go to bed and not worry about me. We just didn't want their basement tenant to rummage through it since he's a drunk. So she pulls it into her bedroom and hides it. I end the call and my partner proceeds to tell me you and I will NEVER have a shared bank account and this is why (I NEVER WANTED ONE ANYWAY!) I said okay I am sorry I thought I had it that's all and he went on and on how good he was about his wallet and stuff and said well this will teach you a lesson I have to train you and maybe one day you'll learn. He goes inside himself to get the nicotine. While I stay sat in the car bawling my eyes out because fuck letting him see me sad. 

We get home and I am upset I grab the kids out of the car and haul them off to bed and myself as well. Today the next day I wake up and tend to the kids my partner is in a bad mood he accuses me of gossiping about him to my mother which wasn't true I set his record straight for that one and I told him I stood by his word on that (again story time for later) he then accuses me of lying about how my phone autodialed police (last July there was an incident I'll get more into that later) I even showed him the proof of how it works on an iPhone by pressing the two buttons on the side at the same time or multiple times depending on the settings. He still refused to believe me but okay I just decide to go downstairs and feed/change the kids. I come back up to bring him a coffee and he's in a foul mood I try to pretend nothing happened and be playful. That didn't work tbh... I come back up a little later I was trying to tell him the kids needed diapers and that I needed to go to Costco to do so but I needed my wallet he told me nope this will teach you a lesson. That started another argument. Cause wtf my kids go without because it's going to teach me a lesson? I had enough to last me the night but damn... he stayed in bed until about 3 he comes down and doesn't say much to me or anything. I go and clean the kitchen and eventually get dinner started and served we go to say grace at the table my 4yr old usually does so but tonight he wasn't wanting too so I chimed in and started giving thanks and I was interrupted by my partner and forced to end my prayer mid sentence... this really got me after everything today.,, after dinner the kids are watching tv with my partner and I am tending to our baby eating food... my other diaper child had chugged a huge thing of water before sitting down to eat and I had changed him maybe an hour before I started cleaning and cooking and he had a juice at supper time. He happened to pee through the side of his pamper but their father never even checked his diaper or anything while I was busy ofc. So I hear him say what did you do? Did you pee!? And he yells at me and asked me if I had not changed him I said yes I had changed him shortly before I cleaned and cooked dinner but he did have a large water before hand. So he gets mad at me and I take the kids to shower as I wanted to sooner but baby was still eating food. He goes on and on about he should've only had one child and I told him he could've checked his diaper. (The diaper size is a size smaller too oops) but he basically tells me to fuck off. I go back downstairs and grab a towel and rag and clean the small spot on the chair as he sits talking on the phone... I'm annoyed at this point and go back upstairs to bathe the kids. He gets off the phone and asks me wtf my problem is and I tell him I'm fucking annoyed with his bs and I walk away and I went to call my BIL (literally the only one who can calm him down is his brother) to see if he'd talk to him but I hung up after the first ring and I text my other SIL and tell her I want him to leave and then I guess his brother called his phone and immediately he starts telling me we're over because I called his brother and he tells me to go back to ""my boy toy "" (my ex) and that I can sleep with him.. I get so mad I blow up I scream at him to get the fuck out and to leave the house for the night I don't want to see him. He says ""it's my fucking house I'm not leaving!"" (We're both on the lease btw) I again tell him to get the fuck out of the house and get a hotel anything just leave us alone tonight. He keeps repeating the same bs it's my house it's my house you get the fuck out. I said no you're the man you need to get out or I will call the police and have them escort you out. I fucked up by saying police I fucked up everything. Now things hit the fan big time... I've tried to apologize about saying I'd call police but it's bad.

1k2tht7,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1k2tht7/ive_been_pretending_to_love_coffee_for_years_and/,I’ve been pretending to love coffee for years and I don’t know how to stop now,"I feel like a fraud in my own house.  
So, when I first started dating my now-husband, I told him I liked coffee because he LOVED it. Obsessed. Black, no sugar, dark roast, espresso machine — the whole deal. He made it such a cute thing in our early relationship, bringing me “my favorite” cold brew, planning coffee dates, even buying me fancy beans for birthdays.

But here’s the thing. I *hate* coffee. Always have. It tastes like burnt dirt water. But I loved *him* and didn’t want to be the girl who ordered hot chocolate at a café while he talked about brewing methods.

So I started pretending. I’d sip it, smile, say “Mmm, smooth,” then secretly pour it into the sink or give it to a coworker. When we moved in together, it got harder. So I started adding tons of milk and sugar. He noticed and offered to “adjust the ratios” and now he makes me one every morning before I wake up. It’s the first thing I smell each day. And I drink it.

I’ve trained myself to tolerate it over the years, but not enjoy it. I even have a *favorite roast* now (a total lie). He bought me a coffee subscription for Christmas. Once he surprised me with a barista class. I smiled so much that day my face hurt.

It’s not even the coffee anymore — it’s the web of lies I’ve built. I don’t know how to come clean after all this time. What do I say? “Babe, you know those 800 cups of coffee you’ve lovingly made for me over the years? Yeah, I’ve been suffering through every one of them.”

Maybe I’ll keep pretending until I die. Or maybe I’ll fake a sudden “change in taste buds” and switch to tea. I don’t know. I’m in too deep. Help.",8,1745059546.0,confessions,19,0.79,False

She said he saw her story and he was also there. So we met him in the park and obviously I was like wtf

I was not happy and walked to see coffee exhibition and then I came back and after we had an argument , I said how you feel if I bring you somewhere and then start talking to some girl who’s a friend I’ve known for long time

I felt like I was being cucked and in the car back home said maybe we should break up…..then she says I’m weird for not having my friends who are girls and I’m selfish etc ? 

It obviously could be Thai culture where have guys friends is more acceptable, but meeting him there when I’m with her and talking together for like 15 minutes while I’m just sitting then like a spare part because I can’t simple Thai. And it’s Not talking to him just a simple high

Am I being really insecure or am I right to wtf is she doing, I said she was being disrespectful to put me in that situation

Context - about to turn 30 this year. I have achieved what i wanted in life so far , career wise. There is one more academic milestone left, a degree at a good university which hopefully i will get into this year (waiting on the test results basically). And after that, its work work for the rest of my life. I couldve done it sooner according to my parents but i kept taking breaks after each milestone in my life. No regrets on that front btw. 

I studied my ass off all my life so far, often at the cost of free time or time with friends and family. I did have a lot of fun moments, but the study and the stress did cost me my health - weight gain basically. And i did manage to lose almost all of it too and got myself a glow up over the past year. 

These days , i find myself having a short fuse at most things, completely irrational ones at times. I understand initially it was due to the stress of shutting myself in my home for three months and studying for this test that I mentioned, and i like to think i did quite well but i am pissed at myself for making a few silly mistakes. But even after the test, this nagging feeling of irritation remains. I keep thinking is it because im waiting for the results? But its not just that. 

i find myself overstimulated and annoyed for the rest of the day over minor inconveniences.. for example- 

Playing a video game, doing the same shit over and over again if it didnt go to my liking the first instance… 
grinding my coffee and the powder spills over more than usual as i tamp it and it grinds my gears…
People not following my instructions properly or people in my family telling me things multiple times when i am more than capable of understanding them in the first instance…
Not finding stuff where i left them because someone moved them. Ugh i get annoyed by this. ..
And the stupidest of them all - people online in reddit who have the wackiest opinions to my comments and who resort to ad hominem stuff. 
 

I know these seem completely irrational and stupid.

But i find myself avoiding talking to people in my family because of this low threshold for getting annoyed, and because there is not much common ground of topics to discuss with them for me, and also because they end up asking about when ill marry. Which pisses me off to no end. 

So the end result is, i spend most of time with myself, having taken a break from work, not going out of the home, and losing interest in a lot of things which i enjoyed previously. 

I dont talk to people any more than necessary because i am beginning to feel annoyed by it all now, except my close friends and my girlfriend. I genuinely enjoy talking to them and spending time with only them.

1k2tdki,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k2tdki,[SKX781] Why I’m Obsessed with the Seiko Orange Monster – A Love Letter to a Dive Watch Legend,"If you know, you know. The Seiko Orange Monster (SKX781) isn’t just a dive watch—it’s a cult classic. A bold, unapologetic, orange-dialed beast that doesn’t just sit on your wrist, it roars.

Specs & Features (aka why it’s an absolute unit):
	•	Model: Seiko SKX781 (1st Generation Orange Monster)
	•	Movement: Seiko 7S26 automatic (workhorse-level reliable)
	•	Case Size: 42mm (but wears more compact due to the short lug-to-lug)
	•	Lug Width: 20mm
	•	Water Resistance: 200m (ISO-certified diver)
	•	Crystal: Hardlex (Seiko’s proprietary tough glass)
	•	Bezel: 120-click unidirectional bezel with that iconic monster grip
	•	Lume: Lumibrite that glows like a tiny sun all night long

But here’s the thing—the magic isn’t just in the specs. It’s in the vibe.
That bold orange dial? It’s not trying to be subtle. It’s loud. It’s proud. It’s everything a dive watch should be.
And those shark tooth hour markers? Aggressive. Unique. Instantly recognizable. You don’t wear the Orange Monster—you own it.

I fell in love with this watch the moment I saw it. Not because it was fancy or expensive—but because it had character. It’s tough without being flashy, rugged without being clunky. It feels like a piece of gear that’s ready for anything—from deep sea diving to casual coffee runs.

Why I Love It (beyond reason):
	•	It looks like no other watch.
	•	It’s built like a tank.
	•	It glows like radioactive kryptonite in the dark.
	•	It makes me feel like a total badass—even if I’ve never been near a dive site.
	•	It’s a conversation starter every single time.

This watch doesn’t follow trends. It makes its own. And even though the first gen was discontinued years ago, its legacy is still alive and well—on wrists, on forums, and in the hearts of watch lovers like me.

Long live the Monster.

Rain chuckled and looked at the elaborately inked snake that wrapped around her arm and shoulder. Tamar wore a gown with extended cuffs, so hers was largely hidden — only its end could be seen, lying on her sleek bronze complexion.

""Apologies, Telle… I could arrange a meeting with the tattoo artist, but I fear your parents would disapprove.""

Telle reclined with a disgruntled look. ""My mother has a rebellious streak as well, you understand? Once, she slayed a Valor Saint. Our whole clan was exiled to Antarctica as retribution. But, never mind…""

She cast a final glance at Tamar's shoulder and averted her gaze with a proud snort. ""I have no desire for a snake tattoo, regardless. Birds prey on snakes."" She failed to conceal the trace of jealousy in her voice, though, which nearly caused Rain to laugh.

Telle and Tamar were rather alike in that they both had been nurtured by strict Legacy leaders, and usually displayed a rigid mask of restrained elegance to the outside. Yet, while Tamar's somber demeanor was innate to her, Telle's efforts to uphold a distant appearance were often awkward, obvious… and quite endearing!

Rain just managed to hold back a smile. Of course, that was only accurate for those familiar with her. To a casual observer, Tell of White Feather would seem like the embodiment of harsh and austere Legacy pride — and to those unfortunate enough to end up facing her blade, she would be akin to a frigid and pitiless terror.

…But that merely rendered the proud young lady increasingly charming. Rain scanned the area and signaled to a server. Before long, the trio was gazing upon artfully presented cocktails. Each resembled a static artwork contained within a vessel, adorned so finely that consuming them felt akin to a deed of destruction.

Telle regarded her two companions with uncertainty. ""So… we're indulging in alcoholic beverages?"" Notwithstanding her assured appearance, the stunning Feather Knight was in truth rather naive about mundane affairs. It was highly likely that she had never sampled liquor previously, hence she appeared hesitant.

Tamar gestured indifferently. ""I suppose. I'm puzzled, however. Why is there such a quantity of ice? It feels as though we're consuming ice with a mere hint of alcohol.""

Rain gazed upon them in exasperation. ""You two comprehend nothing! I meticulously perused the culinary segment of the Bastion Gazette. This establishment is the trendiest locale on the Lakefront Promenade currently, and these three cocktails are reputed to be exquisite. They are inspired by the deposed Sovereigns. Observe… these represent the Bloody Queen, the Old Valor, and the Sweet Shadow.""

Tamar's cocktail was vivid crimson, Telle's almost clear with precisely shaped ice blocks, while Rain's own was completely dark. She smiled broadly. ""Additionally, there's the fourth variant, the White Flame, which is the most favored… it's crafted with premium Beast Farm cream and potent spirits, resulting in a blend that's both velvety and intense, heating the body and calming the spirit. At least, that's what the Gazette claims. In any case… cheers!""

They lifted their vessels and tapped them delicately. Then, every one of the trio sampled their own. 'Ah… so it's dark due to coffee liqueur!' Rain felt satisfied. The Sweet Shadow was, indeed, delectable... she resolved to rely on the Bastion Gazette henceforth.

Tamar set her vessel aside and smiled... she rarely grinned lately, so it was an uncommon and appreciated view. ""Oh, isn't it time for felicitations? I observed the street lamps illuminate last evening. You two truly accomplished it!""

Rain beamed. ""Indeed we did!"" Telle gazed upon them, had another taste of her cocktail, and sighed. ""I feel jealous. You two already possess electricity… it likely won't arrive at the Chained Isles for another ten years.""

Following the war, the journeys of the three Awakened girls had diverged in various ways. The White Feather clan had reclaimed their ancestral territory, so Telle went back to the Sanctuary of Noctis with her family. She devoted the majority of her days to the Chained Isles now, solely coming back to Bastion every couple of months to represent her clan and handle formal affairs.

Tamar's destiny, meanwhile, was nearly the complete reverse of Telle's. Her father, the Saint of Sorrow, had perished in the last conflict of the Realm War… humanity had suffered the loss of numerous valiant fighters on that grim occasion, and she was among numerous who had been bereaved of companions and kin in the unforgiving forge of combat.

Rain desired to remain with her companion for some time, but regrettably, Tamar was not granted much opportunity to grieve. As the sole remaining offspring of the Saint of Sorrow, she had to take charge of her clan — and in its most trying times, nonetheless. Tamar may have ascended to the position of the new Lady of Sorrow, but she was only an Awakened.

Consequently, she was unable to assert dominion over the ancestral Citadel of the Sorrow clan — thus, her family were compelled to surrender their territories to an individual capable of doing so. That individual was precisely Saint Seishan, the erstwhile leader of the Seventh Royal Legion. Seishan had dealt with the family of the previous lord of the Lake of Tears courteously, but even though they were not coerced to depart, they nonetheless opted to forsake their erstwhile territory.

Consequently, Clan Sorrow transformed into one among the numerous declined aristocratic houses following the War. …Naturally, Rain knew Tamar well, so she was confident that her friend's clan would ascend anew eventually. Indeed, its reputation was already improving.

Tamar had enlisted with the Shadow Clan initially. Subsequently, she took part in the tournament held by the Fire Keepers and made a name for herself in the arena, vanquishing numerous powerful Awakened in an exceedingly fierce and impressive manner. She excelled sufficiently to reach the final round, nonetheless.

Thus, currently, Tamar was in a way a dual operative — admittedly, the factions she was part of were strongly connected rather than antagonistic. Publicly, she was an ascending talent among the recent recruits of the Fire Keepers. Privately, however, she acted as the Shadow Clan's team leader in Bastion… and also Rain's personal bodyguard at times. Life was indeed capricious occasionally.

Regarding Rain, she had remained in Godgrave for some time, subsequently arrived in Bastion to study Shaping under Lady Nephis and civil engineering as part of Chief Bethany's team. Additionally, at some point, she had also unlocked her Aspect.

1k2t50m,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1k2t50m/my_husband_still_doesnt_know_what_that_switch/,My husband still doesn’t know what “that switch” does in our kitchen… and I’m never telling him.,"So years ago when we renovated our kitchen, we ended up with one of those mystery light switches. You know the ones — they don’t *seem* to do anything, but you’re scared to mess with them too much in case they’re secretly powering something important.

My husband kept flipping it back and forth trying to figure out what it was for. Drove him *insane*. He even tested it during the day and night to see if it controlled an outside light. Nope. He eventually gave up and just started calling it “the dud.”

Except… it’s not a dud.

It controls the outlet behind our coffee machine.

I realized it one morning when I flipped it and the machine didn’t turn on. I tested it again and confirmed it — mystery solved. But I never told him.

Why? Because it became my little revenge switch. When he’s been extra annoying — like when he “forgets” to unload the dishwasher for the 3rd time in a row or leaves socks all over the living room — I flip it off the night before.

The next morning, he wakes up grumpy and confused because the coffee machine “won’t work again,” and I just shrug and say, “weird, maybe it’s time to replace it.”

It’s petty. I know. But it makes me feel a little better when I’m scrubbing crusty dishes he said he’d take care of.

I figure I’ll tell him eventually… like when we’re 80. Maybe.",227,1745058030.0,confessions,45,0.73,False
