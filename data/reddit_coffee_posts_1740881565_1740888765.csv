As we rolled into February, things took a nosedive with a brutal plunge to around $92,000 on the first day, setting the tone for a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the month.

Fast forward, and Bitcoin‚Äôs price has dwindled below $80,000, cementing itself as one of the more challenging Februaries in recent memory. Analysts at Coinbase weighed in, noting the chaotic atmosphere driven by the $1.4 billion Bybit hack and some shifts in the macroeconomic landscape.

With trade tariffs and a dip in the Consumer Sentiment Index influencing markets, Bitcoin didn‚Äôt quite bounce back like other equities after a brief moment of optimism from legislative moves in Washington. As it stands, Bitcoin is hovering around $85,200, reflecting a 12% decline from its lofty heights earlier in the month.

The critique from Coinbase reveals that the absence of any shiny new catalysts in the immediate future is keeping Bitcoin from reclaiming its throne above $95,000. With heavy outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs totaling over $2.9 billion last week and nearly $2 billion in perpetual futures getting liquidated, it seems investors are nervously sitting on the sidelines.

In a nutshell, the charts are looking a bit murky, and as the rush to market gets cautious, we‚Äôre all waiting for that spark of resilience to reignite the crypto adventure.

My (26F) bf (41M) have been together for a little over a year. We still kinda feel weird about the age gap but we talk openly and make jokes about it. 


Last night while we were in bed cuddling to sleep together, he turned around and asked me to hug him from his back which I did. A few moments of silence I thought he was starting to fall asleep then I heard him say ‚ÄúWhere ‚Äòave yeww been ol mah life, A?‚Äù To which I replied instantly with eyes closed ‚ÄúI was learning the alphabet while you were in the Cold War‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£



We freaking love to roast each other. I asked him one time to get me something from the other room and he came back with it so I said ‚ÄúThat was fast!‚Äù Then he proudly said ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt call me 10 seconds L (his first name initial) for nothing‚Äù So I laughed and said ‚ÄúAs a girlfriend, I can confirm‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ 


We woke up early today and I asked when I can see him again because he‚Äôs going on an international work trip. He told me ‚ÄúYou can see me when you can stand on a chair‚Äù He‚Äôs a 6 foot guy and I‚Äôm average in height so he never misses an opportunity to make fun of my height. 



As I‚Äôve said, we still feel awkward about our age gap but it‚Äôs nothing in comparison to the great company, hilarious banter we exchange, great sex and healthy communication we have. Many of the possible disagreements we avoided because he always urges me to speak and not bottle up any unresolved problems inside. 


Today, he woke me up with a kiss and a well-made coffee on the bedside table. Nag iiba talaga ang lasa pag sya nagtitimpla ng kape.

My (29F) little brother (25M) has always had an anger issue, from the time he was a kid. Him and my dad would fight over absolutely anything for no reason, to the point they couldn't be around one another. My mom and I would dread when my dad would wake up because we knew him and my brother would fight. 

Growing up my dad was very strict but always tried to encourage a relationship with my brother. From videogames to dirt bikes, you name it, my dad just wanted to have something they would bond over. Keep in mind during this time when my brother would opt out of said hobbies because, ""he was different than all of us"", I would participate in them with my dad so he didn't feel alone. As we got older my brother started acting out more and more, one incident he was yelling at my mom and my dad didn't like it. He told my brother to hand over his phone, my brother spit in his face and threw a hot coffee he was holding in his face. He was 17 at the time. 

During our teenage years I was always the one to help my parents with every chore, every hardship, while my brother was out for days on end partying with his friends, my parents were never as strict with him as they were with me.

Fast forward to these past few years, we lost our mother in April of 2020 to cancer, we knew this was coming for awhile. During her cancer I was designated caregiver, my brother used this time to steal money from my parents, partake in and sell illegal drugs, verbally and physically abuse my mother as well as the animals on our farm. I tried my best to keep the peace but it was to no avail, my brother just seemed mad at the world. 

These past few years since we lost my mom my brother has turned even worse, there are several incidents of him beating my dad, destroying his property, threatening to kill him, you name it. My dad has already called the cops on him and he has been in jail for assault, but my dad bailed him out.. My dad truly believes family always has to be there. I tried several times to talk my dad out of getting him out of jail. I voiced my concern to him that I was worried for his life, I didn't trust my brother. My dad called me heartless, said I do not care about my family. My dad and I have not spoken in almost a year now because of this issue with my brother and a few other hurtful things he has said to me. 

I have now found out from other concerned family members that my dad, who is now 67, is suffering from stage 4 cancer and my brother is even worse. My dad has said he has to keep him high and fed to keep the peace, that when they get into a physical altercation he has to hold my brother down until he stops trying to hurt him. I got concerned and found my brother's social media, which is extremely concerning. He talks about selling his soul, demon worship, cursing people. He has poems about killing family members and watching them rot. He has also posted many terroristic videos. I am truly concerned my brother is a psychopath and it is only a matter of time before something horrible happens. 

Not only has this behavior been going on, but my family members who have talked to him has said he has lost his mind, that he calls me horrible names, has written me out of his will and is putting my brother as the executor. My brother has never kept a job, he has stolen from every single one and been fired or walked out, he has been caught stealing more times than I can count, he steals my dad's things on a regular basis. My parents have a lot of land and farm equipment as well as animals still there, I am truly concerned what will happen to it if my brother gets all of it. 

There is a lot more concerning things with his behavior but I wanted to keep this somewhat condensed, I have been trying for years to get my dad away from my brother. 

Is there anything I can do? Report elder abuse? Just looking for advice. Thank you.",1,1740888236.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

I'm in my first year of a five year contract, and the next year and several weeks of that is going to be spent at this place in California where everyone tells me its the best thing you can do in the Army- but for what?

Every day feels the same. Every night feels the same. Wake up, homework, coffee, class, cigarette, class, cigarette, PT, homework, sleep, wake up, homework, and then, with all the budget fuckery going on now, I've found out that the one thing driving me to actually try and be good at what I've been sent here to get good at has been 'suspended' until further notice.

Everyone else around me got fat bonuses, and I have $0 bonus and forty grand in student loans.

I realize that I'm just being a whiner, and I know that I'm gonna wake up and just numbly go about my weak starting Monday, but I've just felt nothing but dread the entire time I've been in the army, like I just can't be free anymore.

Even then, I know that if I wasn't in, I would want to be. So. Am I fucked up in the head, or this a normal thing to think about? A lot of the time it's just hard to find any reason to get up and out of bed. And just this inescapable feeling that nothing I do will be enough, nothing I do will matter, and if I try, I'm being dishonest. It's like I'm kicking my feet and struggling just to do the bare minimum of being a normal fucking human at this point.

1j1i5sv,https://i.redd.it/veas4sn4a7me1.jpeg,Exploring cell adhesion,"What does a typical day look like for you as a researcher?

A typical day for me starts uniquely. Every morning, I send a good morning message to 
my crush, which gives me a positive start to the day. With a cup of black coffee in hand, I dive 
into reading scientific literature. Staying up to date with the latest research is crucial, as it helps me refine my own work and spark new ideas. 
From there, the day can vary depending on what‚Äôs needed in the lab. Some days are filled with 
experiments, where I meticulously design and carry out studies on cell adhesion molecules. On 
other days, I might be analyzing data or collaborating with colleagues to discuss findings and plan future projects. Writing and revising manuscripts for publication also takes up a significant portion of my time. No two days are exactly the same, but the combination of research, learning, and collaboration keeps things exciting.

Could you share more details about your current research focus?

My research is centered on understanding cell-to-cell adhesion molecules, which play a 
fundamental role in maintaining the structural integrity and communication between cells in 
tissues. These molecules are responsible for facilitating the interactions that enable cells to 
adhere to one another, a process critical not only for tissue formation but also for signaling 
pathways involved in development, immune response, and disease progression. We are particularly interested in deciphering how these adhesion molecules, like cadherins, integrins, and selectins, regulate various physiological and pathological processes. For instance, dysregulation of cell adhesion is a hallmark of cancer metastasis, where the normal adhesion mechanisms break down, allowing cancer cells to invade and spread to distant sites. By exploring the molecular mechanisms governing these adhesion systems, our goal is to identify potential therapeutic targets that can prevent or mitigate such pathological conditions. Our research combines advanced imaging techniques, biochemical assays, and molecular biology to dissect these adhesion mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels. We also collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, including computational biologists and biophysicists, 
to model and predict how changes in adhesion molecules affect overall tissue behavior. 
Ultimately, we hope that our findings will contribute to more effective strategies for treating diseases linked to aberrant cell adhesion, such as cancer, inflammatory disorders, and 
developmental abnormalities.

How do you like to spend your free time outside of the lab?

In my free time outside of the lab, I like to unwind through activities that engage both my senses and my mind. Shopping is a great way for me to relax and explore new trends or find interesting things. I also enjoy purchasing storybooks; I love getting lost in different narratives and discovering new perspectives through literature. And ofc
course, I‚Äôm a big fan of trying out new foods and indulging in delicious meals. It‚Äôs a way to reset and recharge before heading back to the lab with fresh energy!

What advice would you offer to aspiring researchers who are just starting out?

To aspiring researchers, my first piece of advice would be to stay curious. Science is all about 
asking questions and pursuing answers, often to things that haven't been fully explored. 
Embrace the uncertainty and remember that the path to discovery can be nonlinear‚Äîprogress 
often comes in unexpected ways. Alongside curiosity, patience is essential. Research can be challenging, and results don‚Äôt always come quickly, but the process is just as important as the outcome.
Another important aspect is collaboration. Science is rarely a solitary endeavor. Working with others, sharing ideas, and learning from different perspectives will not only help you grow as 
a researcher but also open up opportunities you might not have considered. Don‚Äôt be afraid to 
ask for advice or to seek mentorship. Learning from experienced researchers can provide 
valuable insights and guidance, particularly when you face inevitable challenges.
Resilience is key. There will be setbacks, failed experiments, and moments of doubt. What 
defines success in research is the ability to push through those moments and keep going. 
Celebrate small victories, stay committed to your goals, and maintain your passion for discovery. Finally, don‚Äôt forget to enjoy the journey. Research can be incredibly rewarding when you allow yourself to appreciate the progress you make, both big and small. It's a privilege to contribute to the collective knowledge of the world‚Äîembrace that and let it motivate you every day.

""Research is much like a relationship with someone you love: it brings moments of joy and 
hurt, frustration and passion. Yet, with patience and unwavering determination, the journey 
becomes a path to success.""",3,1740888104.0,Science_India,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We were surprised to see each other there and began talking. I never really noticed him (30M) before, but as our conversation progressed, a spark of chemistry or something happened. He asked if I'd like to get a coffee sometime and I said yes, so we exchanged numbers. I texted him the following day and asked if he was free for that coffee, but he got called into work remotely that day so he asked if I wanted to come over instead.. I declined due to logistical reasons. We continued texting, and I asked his age and told him mine. He said the age difference didn't bother him. FF, a couple days later, he asked me, ""What would you be looking for in a guy like me?"" And then he apologized for making it awkward, but I told him he didn't make it awkward and that I was glad he asked. I responded by telling him that I wasn't sure, but I felt a connection and couldn't say for sure until I got to know him better. I asked him the same thing, ""What would you be looking for in a woman like me?"" He then said he wasn't exactly sure what he was ready for right now. I'm like, cool, we're on the same page. Then the conversation went dead. So naturally, I started second-guessing everything and wondered if I had read too much into him asking for my number. He said, ""No, not at all. I just didn't realize how busy I was and how it would affect my ability to respond to you right away."" I responded with a thumbs up.. and then, for the first time in this last week, he initiated a text, whereas as before, I was the first one texting him. I didn't bother to respond much. Because at this point, I don't know what to think or how to respond! I don't know if he's a shy/insecure-avoidant or if he's playing games, just trying to see if he can get an older woman.

TLDR; my depressed husband has no family or friends he can confide in, and uses me as his dumping ground/punching bag, we have a daughter and I‚Äôm exhausted by life and all he‚Äôs putting on me, I don‚Äôt know how much more I can tolerate 

Husband and I have been together for 8 years. His entire family lives out of state and his father passed away when he was young. He doesn‚Äôt have a good relationship with basically anyone in his family, and is horrible at communicating over text or phone calls with them. He really doesn‚Äôt have any friends to talk to about real life stuff (he talks to co-workers every now and then and has surface level friends), and doesn‚Äôt let anyone in my family in enough to really get to the point where he can go to them for advise or to vent. He recently stopped seeing his therapist because he didn‚Äôt feel it was the right fit but plans to find another one asap. I am beyond exhausted at being his only outlet. 

I have always been extremely close with my family and he‚Äôs known that forever (we‚Äôve known each other for 16 years). I try my hardest and it seems to be a consistent argument over the last almost decade of how ‚Äúexhausting and rude‚Äù it is that my family makes plans and I decide to attend with our 3 month old ‚Äúregardless of if he wants to go or not‚Äù (all his words). Keep in mind there have been more times than I can count that I have declined dinners, birthday celebrations, family parties, etc. that he always conveniently forgets about. All of our fights are blamed on me, and he rarely if ever apologizes or thinks he‚Äôs wrong.

He has anxiety and depression and when he‚Äôs spiraling, he spits off 20 different issues he has (mainly with me or my family). Sometimes I just let him ramble and try to let everything roll off my back but it gets very difficult to constantly have a hard exterior and not let things hurt me so most of the time I try to interject and say something to make it a conversation instead of a berating by saying ‚Äúthose things aren‚Äôt true‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how that happened‚Äù and he freaks the fuck out saying all I do is become defensive/devils advocate and I don‚Äôt listen to him/never let him finish his point. He gets verbally mean and I‚Äôve been called names and he‚Äôs said extremely hurtful things to me that I just don‚Äôt know how much more of these bad times I can take. 

It sucks because when we‚Äôre good I feel like we‚Äôre SO GOOD. But then he makes me feel like I‚Äôm delusional because in his angry/depressed moments he tells me that‚Äôs all a fake version of himself he puts on for me and my family because he‚Äôs always depressed and if he didn‚Äôt love me as much as he did he wouldn‚Äôt even do any of it or spend any time with my family. He says all he wants to do is go to work and take care of his child. He never mentions me or our relationship in what he ‚Äúreally wants to do‚Äù, and that‚Äôs hurtful. If and when I cry from our arguments, that frustrates him even more for whatever reason, and nothing gets resolved. I would say 75% of our fights are brushed under the rug and not spoken about because when it‚Äôs finally ‚Äúmy turn to speak‚Äù I‚Äôm already in fight or flight mode and my response is freeze. I get overwhelmed and don‚Äôt know how to even respond to the long list of things he just spoke about. I know this is why the small issues we‚Äôre having have become big ones now. 

Side note: It also infuriates me when he says all he wants to do is take care of our child because he will literally do the bare minimum. Granted he has bad back issues and works a union construction job, wakes up at 4am, has been working overtime pretty much every weekend since going back after paternity leave, and commutes over an hour both ways to work. However, he does get home in the early afternoon and I don‚Äôt ask him to help me at all before dinner time when I‚Äôm cooking. Over the weekends if he‚Äôs not working, he‚Äôll feed her maybe twice and change maybe 3 diapers total. He doesn‚Äôt wake up with her overnight (not even when he isn‚Äôt working the next day), I don‚Äôt remember the last time he bathed her, he doesn‚Äôt wash any of the bottles ever, never does her laundry, doesn‚Äôt keep track of how much formula we have or stay on top of her sleeping/napping/feeding schedule, if she is fussy he loses his patience pretty quickly (never yells at her or gets mad at her, just hands her off to me). She‚Äôs at the point where he can‚Äôt comfort her or calm her down and he doesn‚Äôt even try if I‚Äôm around. On top of that I‚Äôm still on maternity leave so I‚Äôm with the baby all day and night with no break, keeping the house clean, doing dishes, all the laundry, taking care of the dog, taking garbages out, grocery shopping, making him lunch every day and setting up the coffee machine for him the night before, and cooking dinner every night. And I don‚Äôt bring any of these facts to him because it will be a waste of breath. Also, I have told him numerous times that I appreciate him and how hard working he is and how we wouldn‚Äôt have the life we do without him. I‚Äôve shown him my appreciation by making his favorite home cooked meals, massaging him, writing love letters, etc.

1j1i2tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j1i2tc/im_so_defeated/,I‚Äôm so defeated,"Very long post so thank you to anyone who reads the whole thing. I really just needed a good vent because I never can get it all out. 

TLDR; my depressed husband has no family or friends he can confide in, and uses me as his dumping ground/punching bag, we have a daughter and I‚Äôm exhausted by life and all he‚Äôs putting on me, I don‚Äôt know how much more I can tolerate 

Husband and I have been together for 8 years. His entire family lives out of state and his father passed away when he was young. He doesn‚Äôt have a good relationship with basically anyone in his family, and is horrible at communicating over text or phone calls with them. He really doesn‚Äôt have any friends to talk to about real life stuff (he talks to co-workers every now and then and has surface level friends), and doesn‚Äôt let anyone in my family in enough to really get to the point where he can go to them for advise or to vent. He recently stopped seeing his therapist because he didn‚Äôt feel it was the right fit but plans to find another one asap. I am beyond exhausted at being his only outlet. 

I have always been extremely close with my family and he‚Äôs known that forever (we‚Äôve known each other for 16 years). I try my hardest and it seems to be a consistent argument over the last almost decade of how ‚Äúexhausting and rude‚Äù it is that my family makes plans and I decide to attend with our 3 month old ‚Äúregardless of if he wants to go or not‚Äù (all his words). Keep in mind there have been more times than I can count that I have declined dinners, birthday celebrations, family parties, etc. that he always conveniently forgets about. All of our fights are blamed on me, and he rarely if ever apologizes or thinks he‚Äôs wrong.

He has anxiety and depression and when he‚Äôs spiraling, he spits off 20 different issues he has (mainly with me or my family). Sometimes I just let him ramble and try to let everything roll off my back but it gets very difficult to constantly have a hard exterior and not let things hurt me so most of the time I try to interject and say something to make it a conversation instead of a berating by saying ‚Äúthose things aren‚Äôt true‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how that happened‚Äù and he freaks the fuck out saying all I do is become defensive/devils advocate and I don‚Äôt listen to him/never let him finish his point. He gets verbally mean and I‚Äôve been called names and he‚Äôs said extremely hurtful things to me that I just don‚Äôt know how much more of these bad times I can take. 

It sucks because when we‚Äôre good I feel like we‚Äôre SO GOOD. But then he makes me feel like I‚Äôm delusional because in his angry/depressed moments he tells me that‚Äôs all a fake version of himself he puts on for me and my family because he‚Äôs always depressed and if he didn‚Äôt love me as much as he did he wouldn‚Äôt even do any of it or spend any time with my family. He says all he wants to do is go to work and take care of his child. He never mentions me or our relationship in what he ‚Äúreally wants to do‚Äù, and that‚Äôs hurtful. If and when I cry from our arguments, that frustrates him even more for whatever reason, and nothing gets resolved. I would say 75% of our fights are brushed under the rug and not spoken about because when it‚Äôs finally ‚Äúmy turn to speak‚Äù I‚Äôm already in fight or flight mode and my response is freeze. I get overwhelmed and don‚Äôt know how to even respond to the long list of things he just spoke about. I know this is why the small issues we‚Äôre having have become big ones now. 

Side note: It also infuriates me when he says all he wants to do is take care of our child because he will literally do the bare minimum. Granted he has bad back issues and works a union construction job, wakes up at 4am, has been working overtime pretty much every weekend since going back after paternity leave, and commutes over an hour both ways to work. However, he does get home in the early afternoon and I don‚Äôt ask him to help me at all before dinner time when I‚Äôm cooking. Over the weekends if he‚Äôs not working, he‚Äôll feed her maybe twice and change maybe 3 diapers total. He doesn‚Äôt wake up with her overnight (not even when he isn‚Äôt working the next day), I don‚Äôt remember the last time he bathed her, he doesn‚Äôt wash any of the bottles ever, never does her laundry, doesn‚Äôt keep track of how much formula we have or stay on top of her sleeping/napping/feeding schedule, if she is fussy he loses his patience pretty quickly (never yells at her or gets mad at her, just hands her off to me). She‚Äôs at the point where he can‚Äôt comfort her or calm her down and he doesn‚Äôt even try if I‚Äôm around. On top of that I‚Äôm still on maternity leave so I‚Äôm with the baby all day and night with no break, keeping the house clean, doing dishes, all the laundry, taking care of the dog, taking garbages out, grocery shopping, making him lunch every day and setting up the coffee machine for him the night before, and cooking dinner every night. And I don‚Äôt bring any of these facts to him because it will be a waste of breath. Also, I have told him numerous times that I appreciate him and how hard working he is and how we wouldn‚Äôt have the life we do without him. I‚Äôve shown him my appreciation by making his favorite home cooked meals, massaging him, writing love letters, etc. 

I feel like I‚Äôm with a manipulative narcissist who is emotionally and mentally abusive and I just don‚Äôt know how to even stop this cycle. I love him so much and he really is a great dad to our daughter. I just don‚Äôt know how much more I can handle. ",1,1740887841.0,Marriage,0,0.6,False

My Generation Is Blind to the Prosperity Around Us! I'm sitting in a small coffee shop near Nokomis (Florida) trying to think of what to write about. I scroll through my newsfeed on my phone looking at the latest headlines of presidential candidates calling for policies to ""fix"" the so-called injustices of capitalism. I put my phone down and continue to look around.I see people talking freely, working on their MacBook's, ordering food they get in an instant, seeing cars go by outside, and it dawned on me. We live in the most privileged time in the most prosperous nation and we've become completely blind to it.Vehicles, food, technology, freedom to associate with whom we choose.These things are so ingrained in our American way of life we don't give them a second thought.We are so well off here in the United States that our poverty line begins 31 times above the global average. Thirty One Times!!!Virtually no one in the United States is considered poor by global standards. Yet, in a time where we can order a product off Amazon with one click and have it at our doorstep the next day, we are unappreciative, unsatisfied, and ungrateful. ??Our unappreciation is evident as the popularity of socialist policies among my generation continues to grow. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said to Newsweek talking about the millennial generation, ""An entire generation, which is now becoming one of the largest electorates in America, came of age and never saw American prosperity.""Never saw American prosperity! Let that sink in.When I first read that statement, I thought to myself, that was quite literally the most entitled and factually illiterate thing I've ever heard in my 26 years on this earth. Many young people agree with her, which is entirely misguided. My generation is being indoctrinated by a mainstream narrative to actually believe we have never seen prosperity. I know this first hand, I went to college, let's just say I didn't have the popular opinion, but I digress.Why then, with all of the overwhelming evidence around us, evidence that I can even see sitting at a coffee shop, do we not view this as prosperity? We have people who are dying to get into our country.People around the world destitute and truly impoverished. Yet, we have a young generation convinced they've never seen prosperity, and as a result, we elect some politicians who are dead set on taking steps towards abolishing capitalism.Why? The answer is this,?? my generation has only seen prosperity. We have no contrast. We didn't live in the great depression, or live through two world wars, the Korean War, The Vietnam War or we didn't see the rise and fall of socialism and communism.We don't know what it's like to live without the internet, without cars, without smartphones. We don't have a lack of prosperity problem. We have an entitlement problem, an ungratefulness problem, and it's spreading like a plague.""",0,1740887668.0,GenZ,16,0.36,False

One of my local grocery stores put out a bunch plums (at a decent price!) and I had to grab a couple of pounds. I find off-season plums are much better for baking than eating, so some of these I'm going to use for jam, and the rest went into this Plum Cake. The recipe is from [tastesbetterfromscratch.com](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/plum-cake/). I've made it several times and it never fails to elicit smiles and ""mmmmmms"".

* 1 1/2 cups (187.5 g) all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 cup (113 g) butter, room temperature
* 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* 1/2 cup (122 g) milk (See below for substitutions.)
* 1 pound plums , pitted and cut into 8 slices \*NOTE: I add 2 pureed plums to the wet ingredients because I found this recipe to be a bit dry.

**Instructions**: 

1. Preheat oven to 350¬∞F. Grease an 8 or 9 inch springform pan, (or bake in a 9 inch deep dish pie plate, or round or square baking pan and cut and serve from the pan).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt.
3. In another bowl, or stand mixer, add butter and sugar and mix for several minutes, until pale and fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla and almond extract and mix until combined.
4. Add half the flour mixture, then half the milk and beat on low speed until smooth. Add remaining milk, then remaining flour.
5. Smooth batter into an even layer in the pan. Arrange the plums on top, skin side up, in a circular pattern.
6. Bake for 50-70 minutes (depending on how juicy the fruit is), until golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the pan, then remove the springform edge. Allow to cool completely before slicing and serving.
7. Serve plum cake warm or cold, with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, or with a cup of coffee or tea.
8. Store at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.Instructions ¬† 

**Variations:**

* **Different Fruit:** Use pears, peaches, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, or a combination.
* **Milk:** Soy, almond, or unsweetened coconut milk would also work.
* **Gluten Free:** Substitute gluten free flour
* **Dairy free:** Substitute coconut butter and soy, almond, or coconut milk.
* **9√ó13 Pan:** Double recipe to fit in a 9√ó13 pan.

1j1i0do,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenopauseShedforMen/comments/1j1i0do/i_probably_just_need_to_vent_but_will_take_any/,"I probably just need to vent, but will take any advice if anyone has any","Sorry this is gonna be a long ass post, but the background as I think about it and reflect on a post in the perimenopause subreddit about past trauma exacerbating the peri symptoms all ties together for us...

This is my 2nd marriage, first one fell apart to her having a mental breakdown and getting into drugs. My current wife was my best friend in 9th grade, the last person I danced at a school dance with ever and we stayed real close until like 11th grade. My best friend since kindergarten had a locker next to her and told her every day how much I liked her. I was friend zone...Fast forward to 2009, she left her husband and I was still single after my divorce. It started as a facebook message from her and then 2 old friends meeting for lunch and here we are today. I just turned 48 and she will be 48 in April.

After being together for a bit and getting engaged in 2010, we decided to make a big change and start fresh, we moved to Cali in 2011 and stayed there until Covid showed up and took my old man's life. At her direction, we decided we should move back in 2020 to help my sisters and mom out and to be closer to her parents who had been divorced since the late-ish 1990s. We came home for every Chrstmas and spent the time split 50-50 with staying at my family's house and her mom's.

We bought a really nice house, still needed a bunch of work and our animal family expanded from 1 dog and 4 cats to 2 dogs and currently at 9 (soon to be 7) cats. I have a step-son, in 2010 she had a partial hysterectomy, so she wasn't able to have anymore - it didn't bother me, I loved her. Also during all of this and pre-dating us as a couple, she was hurt at work (back) and it worsened over the years. She has now had 2 fusions and is permanently disabled. For about 10 years, she was on a ton of opioids to ""control"" the pain, she has been off them for about 1 year as of now. She is now using THC and a few other meds to control the pain along with an anti-depressant.  She is in constant pain, but has good days and bad days with it...

Perimenopause came up at around Sept 2023 at her annual physical and I don't think anything could prepare us for where we are now. It explained a few symptoms she was mildly experiencing, hot flashes some brain fog, some sexual discomfort. At Thanksgiving, everyone in my family and her mother always comes to our house for the big holidays, that was the tradition we started when we moved back in 2020. We noticed her mom was a little forgetful, but she played it off and we didn't think much about it, she was 69 at the time. By Christmas it was a different story, her mother couldn't cut her food and had trouble moving, she would freeze and not be able to move and her memory was much worse.   

My wife spent a few nights at her mom's to help her and we realized she couldn't be on her own. We attempted to move her in and it lasted a few days before we had to send her to the hospital in an ambulance, my wife cried a lot that day. She was eventually released and after a bunch of back and forth and in and outs of the hospital and rehab facilities, ended up in a long- term nursing home for Parkinson's and vascular dementia. I was of course there for my wife and helped every way I could. 

Her mom is a complicated woman, she would smile at your face and talk behind your back, she could be nice but also very vindictive to those she didn't like or crossed her. My wife has a brother and 2 sisters and basically only my wife and 1 sister was talking to her mom when we moved back. The would go for mani/pedis, out to lunch or the 3 of us would go out to dinner. When her mom would visit her sister and niece in Florida, my wife would watch her mom's 3 cats (which joined our home). During this time, she surrendered one of the cats to the vets office as he just sprayed constantly. As her mother was becoming forgetful, she never had him neutered.  I remember my wife calling me from the vet's office where they recommended that he be an only cat, they had a shelter and would adopt him out. She wasn't sure what to do, she didn't want him spraying in our house, but she felt bad. I told her that I support whatever decision she makes - she surrendered him and he was adopted a couple weeks later. He was a cool guy...

When she ended up in the nursing home, my wife and her mom signed power of attorney and health care proxy paperwork. My wife really struggled with all of this and then we had to empty her place, she reached out to her siblings 2 of which who wanted nothing to do with their mom and were at least a little helpful in packing and moving her stuff. My wife was also basically estranged from her 1 sister and brother, naturally they started talking and re-forming relationships - they also discussed all of their childhood trauma's and emotional abuse from their mother, it seems my wife kept those feelings tucked far away and memories as well. From February up through July, you could see my wife was starting to experience some of the emotional pain from back then mixed in with her growing peri symptoms. In July it was our 15th anniversary, she flipped out on the 4th and just disappeared and told me off for no reason. I had to cancel our 4th of July plans literally an hour before everyone was coming over.  It was also the last time she even talked to her mom, at that point it was fuck her she's dead to me and she is getting what she deserves. I was like huh? A few weeks later she opened up about how her mother called her a slut and a bunch of other name calling through her early teen years until she was like 21 or so. She opened up about the same stuff that happened with her sibling and mom as well. 

She hasn't seen or spoken to her mom since July, only responding to phone calls from the nursing home and/or hospital if she has to go there from falling. For us it has been wildy up and and down and today I'm just not sure anymore...

I also found out she was raped when she was 16, she was tied down by a firefighter she knew and others just stood there and did nothing. I was horrified, she cried, I held her, listened to her, told her it wasn't her fault and I'd always be there for her. 

In July it was decided that she need her 2nd back surgery, she had the ability to pick the date. We talked and it was a good conversation, I asked how long she thinks she could wait it out, since we had a lot of house projects that needed to get wrapped up before fall. I asked if she could make it until the end of September and timing that she'd be recovered before the holiday's, she wanted it done ASAP, so early August it was. I took 2 weeks off of work and worked half days the 3rd week to care for her and our furry family while she was recovering enough to take the dogs out. I handled everything, laundry, cooking, shopping, cleaning etc. But I obviously couldn't handle it all when I went back to work...

We had a really big argument in October and I was ready to end it. She was talking to someone we knew and said she had feelings for him. She claimed that it wasn't like that, but they stopped talking the 3 of us stopped hanging out etc., I almost pulled the plug on us then. She showed me the messages and all of that ended, she wept apologized and all that stuff. Everything was going very well until Early February this year and now the wheels are really coming off. I caught the flu at work and a bad cold after and she caught both. We went out for my birthday dinner with family and she was getting worse, I asked her to make herself a Dr appt and she made one at like 630 pm, I would be home and be able to take her, she was too worn out to go on her own. I come home, massive rage and uncontrollable anger.  She went on her own, diagnosed with pneumonia and she came home and tried to pack a bag and leave, she left bruises on both of my arms - she was fine during the day. I can't even begin to describe how uncontrollable her rage was - it was bordering on insanity. 

Throughout the July time frame through now, one of our cat's started to spray as they began to not like one of her mom's cats. We had a few discussions and my advice was for her to re-home her mother's other 2 cats. I get blamed for doing nothing, and as I reminded her they are your mother's cats you made the call and worked to re-home the one, you need to be the one to do the same for these 2 (my sister found them a home together with a family my brother in law knows - they leave Tuesday). I didn't know how much of an issue it really was for my wife as she would go from anger and rage one day about nothing to being ""normal"" the next.  Apparently, I was wrong and this is a big issue for her. Was hard to tell as she goes through the persi symptoms. You don't know what's a real issue or not, as it comes and goes with her symptoms. 

Last week, I came home and she showed me so I knew, that she looked at the sex offender registry and searched the guy who raped her out and pulled up the article where we has arrested by he FBI for trying to get with his family friend's 14 yr old daughter. She seemed fine, was very open honest and didn't seem unstable or upset.

On Wednesday she went to the Dr to go over her peri symtpoms and she was prescribed an HRT estrogen vaginal ointment, which she picked up on Friday and used for the first time last night. She's waiting for another script, that needed some work and changes due to insurance BS.   


Yesterday, was a red rage day, our cat sprayed on a window while I was on the phone with her and she flipped. I told her you need to re-home the cats, she did, and that I would make ours a vet appointment, I did - top get him checked out and to see if they recommend meds. She went off on the cat and he peed on her pillow and that obviously started WW3. She was raging all day. On the way home she asked if we could go out to dinner, we did and she was normal, we went to the mall after, all normal. Stepped foot in the house and the rage and anger started again, she slept in our spare room with the dogs. 

Today we are in separate rooms drinking coffee, I got up first, she said she wasn't coming down but she wasn't mad at me when I asked if she was. I ask if she's in the mood to go grocery shopping as we do every Saturday, she say's she wants to go. She gets a call from weird number and picks up, it's the nursing home, her mom has a rash that has gotten real bad and the nurse says it's starting to spread and blister, my wife tells the nurse, it must be the evil trying to escape, you can take her to whatever hospital you want. I didn't say a word, but was like WTF. We showered together, she seemed fine still, I said look if you feel like therapy is need for you or for us, let me know - we can make it work. Her eyes welled up and she said she doesn't want to talk about it. I said honey, we have to, she said I never went my self, maybe that might help I'm not sure. I got out of the shower and got ready to go as did she.  All was normal while we were out, we went to Petsmart for stuff for the dogs and cats, she was helpful and nice. We got home, she was doing well. Put groceries away, pet stuff away. I started doing dishes she said stop I'll get that, so you can go clean and change the litter boxes out, I did and she did all was fine. She started to vacuum and she's said it isn't sucking well, I asked if she checked the filters....and there it was insanity rage, she storms out the house and yells I'm buying a new vacuum slams the door and speeds off. She returns with lowes boxes, packs her clothes and belongings and moves into the spare room. Says I have 30 days to fix the cat issue or shes moving out. She has no fucks to give anymore, this isn't a life I want. I'd get rid of every animal and this house today if I could.  She even yelled at her baby (our small dog) and said keep it up and I'll through you out of the house., he is her whole life. She also spent all day yesterday and today arguing with people on Facebook about Trump...

Looking back over the past year, she has delved more into social media, Facebook and instagram reels all day long, Tick tock constantly. It's like she lost her self in that realm as well and her peri symptoms are just off the charts. Constant hot flashes, no sleeping at night, bladder control issues, head aches, memory issues, brain fog, muscle and joint aches, inability to concentrate. She soaked our cats iron skillet in water to clean it...

It's like she took all of her pain throughout her life and everything came out with the perimenopause and reflected every bit of anger and insane rage at my the cats, the dogs and the house.I have been empathetic, there for her, I went like 4 months without sex, didn't give her that much of a hard time becuase I knew she was struggling. It puts me in a no win situation, there is nothing I can do, expect what I read on how to be there for her, but fuck it's hard when you are the focus of it all...",2,1740887609.0,MenopauseShedforMen,0,1.0,False

Churros ng Hotel Chalet: 100 it‚Äôs decent . Need talaga nung dip nito. Mas if bumili sa Hotel mismo . 130 siya pero mas malaki and mas madami ang serving.


Calajo‚Äôs Yogurt: 180 get three toppings to choose from. Maybe opt out sa syrup nalang at nawawala yung lasa ng yogurt niya. But its good. Location is in the middle sa left side if coming from lower session


Caphe Viet 140 : Ordered the coconut viet coffee and my god this one is a 10/10 for me. Nalalasahan talaga ang coconut plus may coconut shavings pa on top and as a texture guy, this is a plus.  Location is upper session malapit sa sm harap ng globe

Gang gang chicken 180 for 3 pcs. Napahiya ako dito kasi sinabi ko na lahat ng flavours na gusto ko tapos sabi ni cashier guy. Sir, on flavour lang po . I got the honey miso butter. It‚Äôs an interesting flavour but maybe dagdagan pa onti ng sweetness. Doesn‚Äôt really have to be honey basta pandagdag lang but the chicken is well cooked. It is boness so mas madali kainin and ang bait pa nung nagserve. They will have a physical store daw sa upper gen soon. 


Other stalls i can recommend from last year na nandito rin this year:
Chef cronuts, Shiraz , mga bool shops and locally owned stores.

1j1htki,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j1htki/tics_and_general_questions/,Tics? and general questions,"Hello! Sorry in advance for the long post.

Over the last few months I‚Äôve been looking into my options for getting a proper evaluation. A previous psychologist (though not a very good one) told me I had ‚Äúanxiety-induced symptoms similar to OCD‚Äù, which I felt made sense and never gave too much thought. This would‚Äôve been over ten years ago, around age 15 (I‚Äôm now 28). They‚Äôre all fairly minor things, like certain routines, eating ‚Äòrituals‚Äô like pulling burgers apart and eating each piece in the right order, dedicated mugs for hot drinks (several for coffee, one strictly for earl grey, etc - I won‚Äôt use someone else‚Äôs mug and I get disproportionately upset if someone uses one of mine). 

They‚Äôve all been fairly manageable until the last couple of years. But now, I‚Äôm finding myself getting more worked up than I used to, particularly with intrusive thoughts and rumination, and especially during stressful periods. I‚Äôd chalked it up to being my (professionally diagnosed) BPD, but now I‚Äôm not sure that completely covers it. 

The thing that made me want to really look into this is my ‚Äòsqueak‚Äô. I have a few funny movement routines I do with my hands and face, but what I do most often is this little squeak in the back of my throat. When I think about it, I feel the need to do it more, but I get embarrassed, so I try to replace it by sort of tightening my throat and exhaling this quiet whistle instead. I hadn‚Äôt realised just how obvious my squeak is until recently, as people are usually too polite to say anything, but now that I know everyone hears it, I‚Äôm really embarrassed - and, in turn, have been thinking about it more, and doing it more. I‚Äôd ballpark it started when I was around 13, as I remember claiming my braces were squeaking when my mum would ask about it. I‚Äôm not sure if this is actually a tic or just something I‚Äôm generally compelled to do, but I don‚Äôt relate to most of the criteria for ADHD or Tourette‚Äôs, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs either of those. I‚Äôm curious if this is common or if I might be barking up the wrong tree?

To be clear, I‚Äôm not asking for a Reddit diagnosis! I guess my main question is how I should be bringing these things up, to whom (GP, psychologist, ‚Ä¶?), and how I might actually benefit from getting a diagnosis (regardless of whether it‚Äôs confirmed or ruled out). It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been able to afford any kind of therapy and I really just want to know the best place to start. 

Any advice or input would be hugely appreciated, thank you so much if you‚Äôve made it this far :) ",1,1740886975.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

1j1hq07,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1hq07,"Row on 5 (*) - London, UK - Feb 2025","Row on 5 is by far the hottest opening in London in the past year. Given that chef Atherton‚Äôs Dubai outpost Row on 45 got 2 Michelin stars outright, expectations were high for Row on 5. We booked a Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner, which ran us ¬£250 per person, in line with other 2 starred establishments in London. Sadly, the announcement came and Row on 5 was ONLY awarded 1 star in its first two months of operating, which is an incredible achievement in itself. 
The restaurant had taken our names prior to our booking, a point that will come up later on in my review.

1st pic- We arrive and have to go down a set of metal stairs before we reach the doors. We ring a bell and they let us inside the restaurant. In Frantzen style, the experience starts with a show around the venue, we are shown the wine cellars, the kitchen, the champagne room. 

2nd pic- Our experience will start in the downstairs seating area for the first few bites of our 15-course menu. 

3rd pic - A dill cocktail I had, with dill oil and gin as base. It was nice, savoury and rich in flavours. I liked it a lot.

4th pic- our first course: Oysters and pearls - N25 hybrid caviar, nori macaron and oyster finished with dill - crunchy meringue-like base, intense flavours of the sea with a bit of dill at the tail end , well rounded snack, inspired by the French Laundry as stated by the serving staff, 18/20

5th pic - Cornish bluefin tuna tart with tuna three ways - smoked, tartare and slowly cooked,marinated with lemon finished with wasabi and kombu - citrusy tart acidic flavours, crunchy , nice cold tuna , well balanced bite but nothing mind blowing, citrus overpowering the other flavours, tiny bit of spice, 16/20

6th picture - Cheese and onion - flavoured after the packet of crisps, onion cooked two ways - dehydrated and turned into a crisp and made with soy sauce into a jam and 15 month old aged cheese - sharp cheese and onion flavours, well rounded and balanced richness from the cheese and the sweetness of the onion, the ‚Äúcrisps‚Äù are well crunchy, overall creative bite, 18/20

7th pic -  Tempura Langoustine claw topped with tomato powder, with galangal sauce - served with name-engraved chopsticks - nice and crunchy, very umami, flavourful langoustine, with a rich sauce, gives elevated prawn cracker vibes ; very heavily inspired by Frantzen‚Äôs langoustine with galangal sauce dish, a bit too much on the nose, I get that chef Spencer Metzger worked at Frantzen and has used his time there as inspiration for conceptualising this menu, but the ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù here is bordering plagiarism in my opinion ; the cutlery for this course is chopsticks - with our names engraved as a token of personalisation ; a very nice personal touch that I genuinely found unique and memorable, and explains why they asked for our names. We are told we are going to take the chopsticks home by the end of the meal, packaged in a nice box, 17/20


8th pic - We are then taken to the upstairs dining room where we are served the second langoustine course.

9th pic - Scottish langoustine with duck egg yolk and curry leaf hollandaise, and curry leaf reduction sauce with Amela tomato jelly - sweetest tomato in the world - sweet and tart flavours from the langoustine and tomato jelly, richness from the hollandaise, acidity from the finger lime - very pleasant well rounded and nuanced flavours: sweetness at the forefront, followed by smokiness , finished by acidity and tartness , I found it more enjoyable than the first langoustine bite , 18/20


10th pic -  Orkney scallop with beuure blanc with dill , finished with XO sauce with scallop roe - rich beurre blanc - my favourite sauce, very umami flavours, the scallop is cooked perfectly, surprisingly not heavy sea flavours, dominated by umami and richness, smells acidic but isn‚Äôt , the sauce was gorgeous and the scallop had slight smokiness because it was finished on the BBQ, I enjoyed the cook on this a lot, 18/20


11th pic - Brioche with quince vinegar glaze and fermented honey, and chicken skin butter with chicken skin and lemon thyme leaves - nice and flaky bread, salty, the butter was very neutral and didn‚Äôt add much. Croissant-like brioche was amazing though, weird listing this as a course, though , 16/20


12th pic -  Cornish turbot poached with beurre noisette, albufeira sauce with fish liver and grapes,  and finished with lovage oil -  perfectly cooked fish, very umami sauce that is cut through by the freshness of the lovage oil and the sweetness of the grapes, 17/20


13th pic -Sika deer finished at the BBQ with beetroot and cassis sauce on the side, with rehydrated blackcurrant sauce and shiitake mushrooms, and a taro puff with venison - very meaty flavour, the sauces both are quite fruity, tart and sweet, a nice addition to the meatiness of the deer, not gamey at all - very enjoyable, the taro puff - very savoury and asian inspired, gorgeous venison flavour and nice crunchy outside, a real hitter of a main course, 19/20


14th pic - Stilton tart with white chocolate bisque, baked in the oven - strong blue cheese flavours, subtle sweetness , nice crunchy tart, cheese after flavours, but I am getting a bit tired of tarts at this point, also weird a tart this small constituting an individual ‚Äúcourse‚Äù, we waited a good 15 minutes for it after finishing the deer, 15/20


15th pic- Citrus curd with sauternes jelly, citrus stock ice shavings and grated yuzu zest , finger lime - very refreshing and citrusy pre-dessert, really good palate cleanser, variety citrus from Pyrenees  - yuzu, Buddha‚Äôs hand, finger like, Kaffir lime, 16/20


16th pic - Chocolate and jerusalem artichoke - caramelised fudge at the bottom, chocolate from Guatemalan single origin cacao, artichoke and hazelnut ice cream, chocolate mousse at the bottom - different textures at play - gooey fudge, crunchy biscuit, rich mousse, soft and gorgeous ice cream , lots of layers to the flavour profile, can‚Äôt really find the artichoke, the bite I found a bit heavy on the sweetness but generally enjoyable , 16/20


17th pic - Black sugar and hazelnut financier with two dips - earl grey tea cream and green oolong team, red tea from Taiwan cold brewed for 12 hours and a freshly baked 71% chocolate tart with smoked olive oil and sea salt; financiers are delicious, earl grey cream - neutral, subtle flavours;  green oolong - flavourful and sweet; this is yet another callback to Frantzen, akin to their madeleines at the end of the meal, served here with thick tea flavoured sauces and cold brew red tea. It was a very decent bite, 17/20


18th pic - Nica Brown Chocolate tart with salt - nice, warm and cozy , but again a very tiny bite, listed as an individual course, it was more of like a petit four than anything. It was okay, but nothing memorable 16/20


19th pic - Petit fours: Served from a petit four trolley, naturally we asked to try them all.A pple cider and cinnamon pate de fruit ; blackcurrants pate de fruit ; matcha tart with mochi ; salted caramel tart ; brandy chocolate ; after eight chocolate ; fudge ; coffee and praline chocolate 
My favourites from these were the after eight, apple cider and cinnamon pate de fruit, and the brandy chocolate (red one in the top right corner). The petit fours were generally nice but overly sweet at the end. 

After 8 - nice but tastes a bit like toothpaste

Brandy chocolate - nice deep brandy flavours, the cream is rich and sweet, but not overly so, with the brandy coming through in a very nuanced fashion; 

Fudge - too sweet, nice soft texture though

Coffee and praline - amazing, crunchy praline filling, deep coffee flavour

Pate de fruit - both are ok, a bit tart but nothing memorable

Matcha tart with mochi - nice and soft mochi, yet another tart

Salted caramel tart - surprisingly not too sweet , nice and soft caramel sauce, and yet another tart

Overall for the petit fours, 17/20. 

All in all, the experience started off strong, peaked halfway through the meal, and then dipped at the end. The seafood and main courses were generally enjoyable. The first few bites were playing off the ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù card a bit too heavily for my liking, I wish the chef would create something of his own, rather than try to ‚Äúrecreate‚Äù famous dishes from other restaurants. The interior was nice, and the service was generally good, at a solid 2 star level. The wine list was ridiculously huge to the point it was hard to hold. A massive book, I liked the detail that there is a description of each wine by the sommelier, but then the wine list is hilariously humongous as a result. They had a smaller by the glass menu, though.

The wine pairings - we opted not to go for one, given the bad value of the pairings. What really irked me is that two of the three lower priced wine pairings had 2-3 upgrade options that sometimes exceeded the value of the pairing itself. For example, the 145 pound pairing had a 220 pound upgrade option for a glass of Chateau d‚ÄôYquem 2013 over the included dessert wine. Why push for upgrades on cheaper pairings? Clearly you are making people feel like you are offering them subpar options for their selected level of pairing. Their highest end pairing was a whopping 995 pounds! There were a few by the glass options and they were generally okay value. I had a 175 ml glass of 2000 Bodegas Urbina Seleccion Rioja for 28 pounds, which was eh, alright, given that the bottle sells for 20-25 quid in shops. 

The pacing was also very weird. The table next to us received 3 courses in the time it took us to receive 1 (as a party of 2, mind you). It is definitely weird waiting 30 minutes for what is essentially a bite or two. At points they were churning out courses every 5 minutes, but near the end the gaps were too large for my liking. The final bites are served downstairs where the meal started (again, heavy INSPIRATION from Frantzen), but the seating downstairs is quite limited - which left us waiting at our table for 20 minutes, until the service staff came up and took us downstairs, presumably because of lack of spacing. This was, however, not communicated, and nothing was offered in the interim to fill our time and distract us from the wait.

I found that the food was either a few hitters of courses in a row, or lacking any real inspiration (repetition of tarts, bread as a course, really?). There were some outliers on the positive side, but generally, I‚Äôd say a 1 star rating is well accurate, given the mismatch between the level of courses throughout the meal. The staff there were generally disappointed by the 1* rating they received in the 2025 Guide and said they were expecting at least 2, but now they are aiming for 3. The service was generally great and they made our occasion feel special. At the end, we are given laser-engraved chopsticks with our names on them and the menu in a wax-sealed envelope with our names on them. A very nice personal touch, something you‚Äôd see at the highest level of dining establishments. Sadly, the consistency of the high level of food was not quite up there yet. They still have a lot of work to do until they reach the 2 star, let alone the 3 star level, but hopefully with time they find their stride. I give the experience a 17/20, where on my scale a 16/20 is a 1 star experience, a 17 is a 1.5 star, a.k.a. a very strong 1 star, pushing for 2 in the future (think Akoko), an 18 is a 2 star experience, a 19 is a 3 star experience, and a 20 is a solid, solid 3 star, a truly perfect experience. 

For reference, I have given Mirazur 18.5/20, Akoko 17/20, Frantzen 19.5/20 and the Living Table at Disfrutar 19.75/20. ",22,1740886631.0,finedining,2,0.96,False

I‚Äôll start with a little about me - I'm 56, married, and don‚Äôt have kids. I'm looking for a platonic friendship with a woman 40+ (bonus points if you're local!). Just to be upfront, I‚Äôm happily partnered and not looking for anything romantic - just a genuine, meaningful friendship.

I work in a male-dominated field, and while it has its moments, sometimes it‚Äôs nice to step away from that and have conversations with someone who brings a different perspective. Truth be told, I can count my close female friends on one hand (and still have fingers left over), so I‚Äôd love to change that.

**A little about me:**  
I‚Äôm naturally introverted - my idea of a great Saturday night is playing video games at home rather than going out. Bars aren‚Äôt my scene, and I can‚Äôt remember the last concert I went to. But I love the outdoors and spend as much time as I can RVing in the summer. I enjoy working with my hands and take a lot of pride in what I do.

I have two senior dogs who aren't spoiled in the least, and I appreciate good craft beer and classic rock. My idea of ‚Äúnew‚Äù music is anything from 20 years ago, haha! I enjoy deep, thoughtful conversations about all sorts of topics, whether it‚Äôs books (fantasy & sci-fi are my go-tos), YouTube documentaries, or just the quirks of life. Also, I make a killer grilled steak. Oh, and my sense of humor? Dry and sardonic, or so I‚Äôm told.

**A little about you:**  
You‚Äôre intelligent, 40+, and have a wide range of interests that you‚Äôre passionate about. Whether you‚Äôre married, single, have kids, or not - it doesn‚Äôt matter to me. What does matter is that you can hold a great conversation and value having a solid friendship where we can talk about anything and everything. You‚Äôre comfortable in your own skin, can laugh at yourself, and are looking to add a great connection to your life - not change it.

**What I‚Äôd love for us:**  
We chat whenever we can, share our thoughts, and have each other‚Äôs backs. We‚Äôre that trusted friend to vent to, bounce ideas off, or just share random life moments with. If we live nearby, maybe meet for coffee once in a while. Looks don‚Äôt matter, but I‚Äôd like to trade face pics - just so we know who we‚Äôre talking to.

1j1hmvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackerBarrel/comments/1j1hmvr/issues_with_cracker_barrel/,Issues with Cracker Barrel,"Can anyone relate to what is below? I know the grammar isn't great. I just wanted to get it all down. 

1) Usually short staffed

This location is short-staffed because servers call out of work or not enough people have been scheduled in the first place. Unfortunately, the servers that are waiting to leave during shift change pay the price by staying later than scheduled.

 

2) Ordering is not done properly so this location runs out of items often. Also, when kitchen run out of food during a shift it isn't communicated with servers at times.

This location runs out of resources almost everyday. Sometimes, server don't find out in a timely fashion. The kitchen will tell one person and the news doesn't travel to everyone on the floor. There is a board, which is used to list 86ed (foods not available), but it is rarely updated. Therefore, it isn't reliable to just look at that board. 



3) Employees purposely waste company resources to get out of duties

Half bottles of sauces get thrown out of because the responsible people try to avoid portioning it. Servers and to-go specialist run out of sauces because folks cut corners.



4) Trays and plates are extremely hot and burn because hot lamp has been turned up. 

Recently, customers have been complaining about their sides being cold. Since customers complained about the cold food, management turned 

 up the temperature of the heat lamp. This has caused the plates and the trays to be extremely hot to the touch for anyone handling them in the expo window and the floor. I had to place the tray down because it hurt to hold the tray. Other servers have to use their books, another tray, or purposely wear long sleeve to avoid being hurt. I had a guest touch the plate and wince from handling the hot plate. This issue could be avoided if the kitchen actually waited to plate the sides of the meal after the main portion has been done. Let say someone orders fried catfish and 2 sides of carrots. The cooks will put down the carrots first and then the fish. The carrot sides will cool down and guest will ask for a replacement. To me, it makes sense to add carrots after the fish comes off the grill. Everything will be hot and the guest will be happier. Instead management decided to turn up the lamp and put servers and guest in a harmful and painful situation. 



5) Some employees are video chatting or excessively talking on the phone while on the clock. Sometimes the conversations are extremely inappropriate. 



6) Food isn't stored properly.

The ice cream is constantly frost bitten because the temperature in the freezer is too low. People can not get ice cream with their desserts because of it. 



7) The coffee machine has been broken for months. The heaters for the pots do not work, water leaks from them all the time, and it has not been addressed properly.



8) Food is not made consistently so the quality is a hit or miss.

Examples: 1) Sawmill gravy can be watery, the right consistency, or too thick. 2) The rice for the chicken and rice (monday's daily dish) can be undercooked. 3) Sweet tea is too sweet or not sweet enough because there isn't a specific amount of sugar being used. 



9) Servers usually end up doing the to-go specialist or hostess job at one point of the day but aren't paid accordingly. This really falls under the short staffing issue.



10) The eating utensils are usually dirty after being washed. Servers have to inspect utensils before rolling them. They will usually find food particles on them even after going through wash 2 - 3 times. Cups will have lipstick stains on them even after being washed. It just makes the servers' job harder because time is wasted on things like this.  



11) The seating rotation does not make sense. 

Instead of sitting servers in order, servers are seated based on clean tables. The hosts/hostesses are pressured to get rid of the wait and that means servers will be seated with multiple tables at once. This may lead to less than great service for guests and lower tips for servers. 



12) Servers may get punished if a certain percentage of guests order water with their meal. 

The punishment is losing a table in the section you have. So if a server achieves that percentage of non-water drinks or higher, they get 4 out of 4 tables in their section. If the server gets too many water orders, the server gets 3 out of 4 tables. You can't force people to get non-water drinks. This system makes no sense and is demotivating. Please get rid of this.



13) Servers get seated outside of their designated sections to get rid of wait. This is an issue when the person has already been seated many times in a short period of time. The service guest receives suffers because the server is juggling a lot at once. 



14) Servers gets seated way too close to the times they are supposed to be off. The schedule will says someone is scheduled to stop work at 7 and the host will give that server another table at 7. This means the server needs to tend to the tables needs while completing side work. Sometimes tables stay for 1 hour or more. 



15) People are not trained properly AT ALL. Its more of a figure it out yourself type of environment. This is also why things aren't going well and tasks aren't done in a consistent manner.



16) Unsafe work conditions: Some things are out of reach and there isn't a safe stepping stool. So you are forced to just bat at boxes place high up. If there is...no one knows where to find it. These things should be shown during training.",2,1740886326.0,CrackerBarrel,0,1.0,False

Today was pretty wild though....First I hear it mentioned in a TV show I was catching up on (one of the Law & Orders), then I hear it mentioned in the book *Dark Matter* by Blake Crouch, then I'm catching up on FBI: Most Wanted and the episode takes place in Maine. The killer knows that the FBI is on to him and suggests that he and his girlfriend take an impromptu vacation....to Miami.

I will bust ass getting deals on groceries shopping at HEB, Walmart and then rarely at Randall's. Yesterday I got the biggest bang for our buck I have done in decades! I live outside Austin so Randall's trips are far & few between. I had some great steaks last week picked at Randall's that were 50% off. Either way eat or freeze within a day by next day. The steaks were fantastic!! Tendered like none other I have had before.
So yesterday after visiting my son I went back to Randall's for more steaks at 50% off and not only were steaks, meats, chickens 50% off they were also on special. Randall's also had some fantastic deals using their U coupons.

This is an abbreviated list but not all inclusive. I just had to share: 
Special: Buy 2 coffees Starbucks, Maxwell House etc and get 3 yes 3 free! I could not believe it so I got 3 large Maxwell Houses and splurged on 2 bags of Starbucks Mocha Coffee!

I purchased Ny York Strip Steaks avg price $2.00-$ 4.00 each. Beef Sirloin for $2.71 total, stew beef $3.63, 2 pkg of season Salmon each about $4.00. Pizza $4.99. 

I tried and stay away from  processed food however they had large size Marie Claire's dinners for $2.47 each normally cost atleast $6.00 a meal! They are great for us when no one feels like cooking or lunch.

Purchased egg bacon burritos, Blue Bell Dr Pepper Ice Cream gallon size. Coffee cake, cookies from bakery. Ground Yagu Beef Patties, Prime Rib Beef Patties, Gr Beef, Chuck Pot Roast, Pork Spare Ribs huge pkg enough for 2 meals for $8.37. Chicken breast buy 1 get 1 free, Chicken thighs buy 1 get 2 free. 2 family size pkg of Sandwich Oscar Meyers Turkey $4.00 each normally at Walmart/HEB $9.00! 3 ROLLS OF Jennie O's Oven Roasted Turkey Rolls 3 for $14.97. 

The list just goes on and on so I have included photos with most items I purchased. The fruit nut tray $5.99 however huge pkg of grilling vegetables $0.00! The grilling vegetables cost at least $12.00 minimum a pkg at Walmart/HEB.

TOTAL OF ENTIRE PURCHASE WAS:  $392.00!

I have posted 20 photos to show my haul of great deals! Not everything purchased is in the photos. Some may say I what I soent is a lot of money but it definitely is not! The deals were tremendous where we a household of 3 will have enough food and meals for at least 3 months maybe a little longer! 

I was overcharged on a couple of items to maybe $20.00 total. I feel so blessed in the shopping I did yesterday and what we received. We live mostly paycheck to paycheck and this shopping trip is a blessing! I plan on donating some of the food to the local food bank or the school food boxes. Since I did so well I decided to buy my self a Lotto ticket as a good job pat on the back. Won $20.00. Not rich but hey free money! I shopped from about 6:30pm to 9:00 pm or so and as I was leaving the man behind me said the lady just marked down the steaks. So of course I went back into the store and bought my steaks!

I hope this information helps people when buying groceries. Randall's has some fantastic deals when you look for their U digitial coupons and advertised specials. You truly can save on your groceries! I have no doubt if I had bought all of at HEB or Walmart my bill would have been $450.00- $550.00 maybe more!

Imagine waking up one crisp morning, coffee in hand, ready to tackle the day. You no longer dread checking your bank account or worry about bills piling up. Instead, you‚Äôve got a budget ‚Äî a personal roadmap guiding your financial journey. It‚Äôs not just about cutting costs; it‚Äôs about knowing exactly where your money goes and taking control.

**üó∫Ô∏è What is a Budget?**

A budget is like a map for your finances; it shows you where you are and where you want to go. Instead of wondering, where did my money go? You‚Äôll be empowered to say, this is exactly where my money is going. What if I told you that, according to various financial studies, nearly 65% of Americans do not have a budget? This means they‚Äôre missing out on the peace of mind that comes with financial control. A budget allows you to make informed choices about spending without falling into debt traps, such as overdraft fees or credit card debt.

**üíµ The Building Blocks of Your Budget**

Creating a budget involves understanding its key components. Start with¬†**income**, which includes your job salary, freelance work, and any other earnings. This is the foundational piece of your budget.

Next, identify your¬†**fixed expenses**¬†‚Äî the bills that remain constant each month, like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and car payments. These predictable costs are essential for planning. Then, account for your¬†**variable expenses**, which fluctuate monthly, like groceries and entertainment. Together, these elements give you a clear view of your financial landscape.

*::: This article is about the free*¬†[*Personal Finance Fundamentals Course*](https://app.bventured.com/courses)¬†*on our bVentured Wealth Academy. We encourage you to take it, it‚Äôs completely free.*

**üìä Tracking & Adjusting**

Once you‚Äôve set your budget, it‚Äôs important to continuously track your expenses. Use budgeting apps, spreadsheets, or even a plain notebook ‚Äî whatever works best for you. According to financial experts, regularly reviewing your budget keeps you on track and helps identify wasteful spending.

You will also want to make adjustments as needed. Life is unpredictable; that‚Äôs why having a flexible budget is a smart move. When your financial situation changes ‚Äî like a job shift or unexpected expenses ‚Äî you need to modify your budget accordingly.

**üöÄ Types of Budgets for Different Needs**

Not all budgets fit the same mold. Consider popular methods like the¬†**Zero-Based Budget**, where every dollar has a purpose, ensuring your income minus expenses equals zero. Alternatively, the¬†**50/30/20 rule**¬†allocates 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt repayment.

Experiment with these methods to find what suits your lifestyle and financial goals best. Whether you prefer a digital solution or an old-fashioned envelope system, the choice is yours.

**üéØ Setting Financial Goals**

A budget is a tool for achieving your financial dreams. What do you want to accomplish? A new car? A down payment on a house? Early retirement? Documenting your specific goals is vital. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps and align them with your budgeting choices. This makes your dreams feel attainable rather than distant fantasies.

**ü•≥ Celebrating Milestones**

Don‚Äôt forget to celebrate your financial wins, big or small. Did you stick to your budget for a month? Reward yourself! Reaching milestones offers motivation and encourages you to stay focused on your goals. Remember, budgeting is a journey, not an ultimate destination.¬†**With each step, you grow closer to financial independence.**

Budgeting is more than just a method to track spending. It‚Äôs a¬†**foundational tool**¬†that¬†**can**¬†lead to¬†**financial freedom**. Take charge today and turn your financial dreams into realities. With the right strategy and tools, you‚Äôll find that mastering your money is a journey worth taking.

Officially, I had the position of Laboratory Technician. Dr. Verde‚Äôs lab rarely took on undergrads (or so I was told by the grad student, Erica, who always made her dislike of me well-known) and I was lucky to have the position. 

In reality, ‚Äòthe position‚Äô paid a quarter over minimum wage and only offered 15 hours a week. Not enough to live on by a long shot, but enough to make it difficult to find another job to work around it. I was expected to be there in the middle of the day, too. It was necessary to have some overlap with Erica and Dr. Verde.

Outside the door to the lab, I chugged the last of my coffee before chucking the cup. It was barely ten in the morning, but it felt much later than that. I‚Äôd tried to catch a nap after the ordeal at the gas station--the adrenaline pumping my heart into double time made that impossible. Coffee was the next best thing. I shouldn‚Äôt have bought it, though. I‚Äôd have to find some way to tighten my budget if I wanted to make rent. 

I pushed inside the lab. The hot, humid greenhouse air met my nose. I was already sweating.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs five after ten,‚Äù Erica supplied without even looking up. She was pipetting something, her face scrunched up in concentration. 

‚ÄúThanks for noticing,‚Äù I mumbled and hung my bag on the hook near the entrance. Erica, a bit like Art, was the kind of person who I assumed had always been handed everything in life. Her long, dark hair was always pulled back in a sleek ponytail. The heat and humidity never phased her. She wore thin gold stud earrings and a thin gold necklace and a thin gold bracelet every single day. One time, I‚Äôd come in to see her gym bag and tennis racket sitting near the entrance, as if that was something people really did--just play a quick tennis match and then saunter off to the lab.

She was, of course, brilliant. She had several publication credits already and she was barely 25. She‚Äôd waltz into her PhD and probably be a prof before 30.

That only stressed me out more: I was still so unsure of what I wanted to do. Especially after the events of last winter, I had no idea what shape I wanted my life to take. I had started in science because I liked reactions. Back in high school, I watched my teacher pour vinegar and bicarbonate soda together. I remember touching the vial after--it was cold. Somehow, those two things mixing together had drawn the heat out of the room.

In my mind, I understood how a reaction could make heat. Bombs exploded. Fire started. Even those hand warmer packets get hot when shaken. But to pull the heat away from the room like that? Where did the warmth go? 

So often life was squeezing me from different sides--science, business, magic--and I was in the middle of it all, more like a ragdoll being thrown around than a bit of marble being carved into the right shape. 

I sighed. My hair lifted with my exhale.

‚ÄúYou can measure the sprouts,‚Äù Erica told me, even though I already knew that. The project in Dr. Verde‚Äôs lab was to look at the viability of cross-breeding species of plants. Specifically, the study was looking at gene incompatibilities in sister species. Dr. Verde wanted to make hybrids that thrived, instead of withering up and dying, which they all seemed to do.

Dr. Verde was nice, at least. He was a sunny sort of person, and most surprising of all he‚Äôd warmed to me. I didn‚Äôt think I had a shot in hell of getting an internship after how little I‚Äôd focused on my studies in the winter semester, but somehow I‚Äôd gotten on here. Which, again, Erica seemed displeased at because my lab skills were not up to her standard and there were several people who Dr. Verde turned away that were more qualified than me.

But gift horses and mouths and all that. The greenhouses were on the top floor of the agriculture building, and in the winter they were quite pleasant. Now, I was melting. Sweaty and hot and smothered. My mind was turning with what other job I could work into my schedule. Mostly, I was coming up with nothing.

I began to measure the sprouts--Erica tutted. Clearly, I was doing something wrong. What it was, I had no idea.

The sprouts and me both: I could mark us down as failed to thrive.

1j1h82n,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1j1h82n/i_will_always_love_you/,I will always love you,"Dear C,

I know I need to keep sight of the reasons I left, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I still love you and the connection we had, and I still love the life we would have built together. Although we were only together for a short time in the scheme of things, you really felt like home to me and your impact on me was profound. You were my best friend for that time and you made me feel so special, safe, and seen. You supported me through some pretty major things that were going on in my life, and I will always be grateful to you for that. My heart still squeezes when I think about you and I still occasionally wake up from dreams where we‚Äôre doing ordinary things together and it just feels like sunshine. I really thought you were my person, and I still think you might be, despite our differences and emotional baggage. Even though I must move on, I still believe fate can bring two people together more than once, and I believe that there‚Äôs such a thing as right-person-wrong-time. I‚Äôve learned lessons from losing you that I‚Äôm not sure I would have learned if we‚Äôd stayed together, so I am at least grateful for knowing what I now know.

I still haven‚Äôt told you all the reasons I left. You know why I got scared when I learned what you believe, and you know that I would really like to talk about that more and try to understand you better. But you don‚Äôt know that I noticed a shift in you while I was visiting. You seemed colder, quieter, and more distant. I don‚Äôt know why you were like this, but my anxious thoughts certainly tried to fill in the blanks with negative assumptions. It felt to me like you were losing interest in me or weren‚Äôt prepared to build a deeper connection with me - it felt like you‚Äôd put up walls and I started to feel like I was a bit of an inconvenience. I think I really struggled with finding the mental clarity to be able to communicate these fears and what I needed from you in an effective way while I was with you, and for that I am sorry.

I need to protect myself from relationships where the effort is one sided, because no matter how much I love you, I will only end up hurting myself if I‚Äôm the only one asking for physical and emotional closeness. It took me years to realise that I can‚Äôt wait for someone else to want the same kind of connection that I want, so I know it‚Äôs best if I focus my energy on myself for now, and maybe someday on someone who does want to put in the effort to deepen their emotional and physical connection to me, and can offer me the reassurance I need in order to know that my feelings are reciprocated. I need someone who is generous with touch and words to show they care. Someone who wants to break down barriers and talk about healing with me. I wanted those things so badly with you, just a continuation of the way things were when you visited me and the things we would talk about on calls.

I hope someday you can see that all my words and actions have come from a place of love despite maybe not knowing the right way to love you. I‚Äôve learned so much from this time apart that I wish I‚Äôd known before I met you. No healthy relationship exists without constant effort and intentionality on both sides, and communication of needs. It‚Äôs not enough for someone to be besotted with you, especially if you don‚Äôt trust them when they say they are, and you‚Äôre not able to reciprocate their feelings and the depth to which they want to connect with you. There‚Äôs no such thing as someone who ticks all the boxes from the get-go either - that‚Äôs how you wind up spending your whole life searching. I‚Äôm still figuring out which boxes are non-negotiable for me because you‚Äôve shown me boxes that I‚Äôd never considered. Nobody is perfect, and sometimes love is greater than our differences. Actually, the perfect person is someone who is willing to communicate openly and meaningfully with their partner, and actively works to grow individually and as a couple. Someone who doesn‚Äôt just answer direct questions, but offers information/reassurance freely, and never stops being curious. Someone who doesn‚Äôt shut down completely and who can take accountability for the part they played when things got tough.

I wanted so badly to go on that journey with you, but I can‚Äôt force you to want it too, and I can‚Äôt make you feel the same way about me as I feel about you, or accelerate your healing. I don‚Äôt think either of us has experienced a truly healthy relationship before, or at least not in a long time, which is why I think this might have been especially difficult for us. But it‚Äôs never too late to learn and it‚Äôs possible to learn together. I‚Äôm sorry I ran when I was scared, and I understand that you might never forgive me for leaving, or be able to trust me completely again, but if you ever find yourself wanting the same things as me and wanting to really try, I can promise you that I would give it everything I‚Äôve got.

You‚Äôre a really special person (one of my favourites) and your friendship is my favourite thing that you gave to me. I‚Äôm so grateful for the time that we had together and for having had a taste of a really pure kind of happiness and tranquility with you. I really do hope we can hold onto our friendship because I still want to understand you better, and I‚Äôd like to be there to tell you to have faith in yourself and your ability to develop into someone who is capable of building a beautiful relationship and family, even if that can‚Äôt be with me. It might hurt like hell seeing you with someone else someday, but I‚Äôd rather face that pain with maturity and see you get all the things you deserve than not have you in my life at all. I know I will keep working on myself and find that happiness again someday too. It‚Äôll be different though, and there will always be a special house in my heart built just for you and all the beautiful memories of our time together. A stunning home with a stream, wisteria and bougainvillea growing on the fence, lots of sunshine, fruit trees, chairs on the porch where we can sit and drink our coffees together, and plenty of space for the dogs to run around.

I just wanted to share my story with this group because I went through my hardest breakup in October and relied so heavily on people active in this group to get me through that time. I didn‚Äôt feel like I would ever get through it and didn‚Äôt believe people when they said I wouldn‚Äôt feel that way forever. But for the first time, I feel like I‚Äôm on tbe other side of things.

I was dumped last October on thanksgiving to very much my surprise. I was absolutely shattered and heartbroken and fought to stay together after we met up a few days after the breakup‚Ä¶ clearly I wasn‚Äôt successful lol

I was heartbroken for months. Crashed out, crying, depressed. I felt like I was going to be stuck in this space forever. I fantasized about him begging for me back and apologizing and saying what a mistake it was. Like‚Ä¶ it was so bad lol. Granted, I‚Äôm at a difficult and stressful stage of my PhD currently which amplified this loss a lot. That said! I stuck to no contact. Didn‚Äôt reach out once, deleted off every social media (including LinkedIn lol) 

I spent the first few months fighting my best to keep up the bare minimum. The only motivation I had was when he saw me, I wanted him to see how good I was doing and want me back. He lives about a 7 min walk from me so I knew I would run into him eventually. Well, I ran into him in December when I very much was NOT my best mentally despite externally looking good (I was heading to an event and picking something up at the grocery store when I saw him). Hell, I looked GREAT and he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to make eye contact w me let alone say hi and that absolutely broke me. It was like being broken up with all over again. I completely crashed out. 

Started going to therapy in January (for this and PhD stress factors) and it wasn‚Äôt like I immediately felt better. It was gradual. But last week in therapy I realized I felt great. I said ‚Äútime is a healer‚Äù and my therapist said ‚Äúno, you did the work. You‚Äôve worked so hard to get yourself out of this‚Äù and you know what, I have! I‚Äôve fought through the depression and sadness and tears and persevered and put the work in in therapy to get to this place. However, I conveyed to my therapist how worried I was to run into my ex again and have all this progress flushed. I told her I didn‚Äôt see any circumstance in which I wouldn‚Äôt crash out after seeing him. 

Well, ironically, I ran into him today on my way home from the gym. I didn‚Äôt look great, wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup and was in sweaty baggy gym clothes. But we chatted on the street, despite him trying to avoid that interaction lol (I made a split second decision to take my headphones off and chat). But as I looked in his face and heard his voice for the first time since he broke up with me, I felt nothing. There wasn‚Äôt the sharp pain of loss or longing. I realized I didn‚Äôt know this person anymore. The person I built up from the past isn‚Äôt this person. It‚Äôs like some illusion shattered. Ya, I‚Äôm now curious what things would be like if we grabbed coffee but he didn‚Äôt ask and I‚Äôm ok. I didn‚Äôt cry, I didn‚Äôt feel sad or numb. I spent about an hour afterwards trying to dissect if I was gaslighting myself into thinking I was ok when I wasn‚Äôt but no, I‚Äôm truly ok. 

For the very first time, it feels like this chapter of my life is over. Im very surprised as I expected to feel the opposite. I thought I‚Äôd be in an endless loop of missing him, seeing him, wanting him. But I‚Äôm instead left with a feeling of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next for me now?‚Äù  I‚Äôm not looking to the past or that relationship anymore. At least for now I feel that way. 

Anyways! I know this is long but seriously I thought I was going to be trapped in that sadness and longing forever and I hope my story can help anyone reading know that your pain won‚Äôt be forever.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm here because the Boundary Waters are my absolute favorite place on earth. I spent several summers portaging through them as a Boy Scout. I worked as a ""canoe guide"" (glorified dockhand and occasional cabana boy to Texas moms) at a resort lodge just off the border in Minnesota. I fell in love with life there, and that's also where I learned to use the stars as my guide.

I'm here because I love the Great Lakes, and I love the cultures that have grown up around them. I've lived in Chicago. I love Detroit and Toronto. I'm obsessed with Gordon Lightfoot's Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Lake Superior is the scariest thing on the planet. I spent ( many of my other) childhood summers at my grandma's cabin outside Portland, Oregon, and going with her to Seattle and Vancouver to gripe about the nursery crops with her friends. 

I'm here because I was obsessed with the history of North America as a kid. I have family who were at Valley Forge, and I have family who were slaves. I have family who were French fur traders. The War of 1812 fascinated me. I got to study law as an American with some Canadians who were among the smartest, most diligent attorneys I have ever met.

I'm here because maple syrup is my favorite coffee sweetener, I love flannel, and this is a magical continent.

1j1guh4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1guh4,"Row On 5 * (London, Feb 2025)","Row on 5 has been mentioned here a few times without much detail, so I thought I'd take a moment to fill in the gaps. I apologise for the quality of my photography - never been a big skill of mine. 

The restaurant was opened in November by Jason Atherton, who should need no introduction, with the kitchen headed up by Spencer Metzger, who has spent most of his career at The Ritz. The team opened up a similar concept, Row on 45 in Dubai, quickly earning 2* last year.

The UK Michelin Guide awarded Ro5 1* around the time of my visit, and I would say this is purely a function of the short time the restaurant has been open. It stands way above the crop of other 1* restaurants in London and (for me) would be strong at 2*, being in the same bracket as, and maybe even a bit better than, Kitchen Table. It sits in my top 5 meals in London and my top 10 globally for sure; I just haven't worked out exactly where in those yet.

Row on 5 occupies one of the most expensive addresses in London, Savile Row, and is next door to where the Beatles' famous rooftop concert took place. The restaurant has been fitted out to match, plush materials everywhere, and feels genuinely luxurious. You move from the downstairs lounge for snacks, up to the main dining room, then back down again for petits fours and digestifs. The air of luxury is set nicely by the very first impression, where the host offers to have your coats dry cleaned - for no additional cost - as you dine. Service is charming throughout, it feels as if they have stolen the best of the best from London's other restaurants. Dishes are generally served by chefs, all of whom are personable, but the rest of the team is outstanding too, a particular highlight being an infectiously enthusiastic sommelier (whose name I looked up afterwards - Roxane Dupuy). It's worth noting at this point that the restaurant serves some serious wines in its pairings. There are three levels, with the first two relatively close together price-wise. I chose the second, which included Egon Muller Scharzhofberger, a Dauvissat 1er Cru, and The Mascot. Pours are quite small, but it is refreshing to see a restaurant serving such serious wines as part of a pairing. There is an extensive by-the-glass menu with prices to suit all budgets, and the bottle list is a weighty tome hundreds of pages long. 

Let's get onto the food!

Snacks:

Oyster and Pearls - introduced as being inspired by the famous Thomas Keller dish. Macaron base with chives, then N25 Kaluga caviar topped with a sphere of oyster cream glazed in Beurre Blanc. This made me realise instantly I was in for a superb meal - technically impressive and tasted great.

Raw Cornish Bluefin tuna in a tartlet made from a reduced and dried tuna bone stock, marinated in fermented yuzu and chile, and with a crispy kombu nest on top. Well-flavoured tuna as I expected from previous occasions I have tried the produce from this trial UK fishery. 

'Cheese and Onion' - onions cooked slowly with rice to form a soccarat which is then baked and layered with 50-month Lincolnshire Poacher cheese, an onion jam which was like an intense brown sauce, and lemon thyme. Very bold flavours here and a nod to childhood British foods like the cheese and pickle sandwich.

(Not pictured) Langoustine claw tempura (a big big claw!) with a galangal and langoustine stock emulsion. Delicate, and very good - the emulsion was fantastic - and this course has one little non-food-related surprise I will leave for others to discover which was quite cool.

Now we move upstairs and to the more substantial dishes...

The rest of the langoustine! The tail is very lightly cooked, brushed with smoked vinegar, and topped with something crisp (not sure what) and shiso flowers. This came with finger lime, curry leaf oil, and salted duck egg sabayon. The langoustine was wonderful but the saucing was even better.

Half an Orkney scallop - would have been a huge one when whole - with a chilli-infused scallop coral XO, salmon roe and sansho leaf in a sake, chive and pike roe beurre blanc. Accurately cooked and flavourful scallop and again, superb saucing. I would say the well-known scallop dishes Core has served beat this out but it was still excellent and to be honest that is a very high level to compare it with. 

Laminated brioche with a honey glaze and served with chicken skin and yeast butter, topped with chicken skin, lemon thyme, and a cep concentrate. Technically excellent, tasted great, a bit messy to rip apart! To be honest, I would love to see the sourdough fad come back for bread courses, brioche has become a bit too ubiquitous in London recently and the amazing bread at Muse for instance provided more joy than this. 

No comparing this dish against other restaurants - it was one of the best fish dishes I have had in years. Lightly aged turbot brushed in brown butter and lemon juice, served with a delightful variant of a sauce Albufera made from a turbot bone stock and which had cured monkfish liver blended into it. In the sauce were some flavourful razor clams, and it was finished with a touch of lovage oil. One of the simpler dishes served, but absolutely stunning, and one which could happily grace any restaurant with any number of stars in the world. 

Sika deer, briefly aged and cooked rare over pine and juniper wood. This had great depth of flavour and came with some equally remarkably flavourful beetroot and a little blackcurrant puree. This was topped with brined and smoked bone marrow and sprinkled with sansho pepper. There was a venison stock, mushroom, port and juniper sauce - massively complex again, as with all the saucing here. Served separately, there was a fried dim sum of the braised haunch. Deer will never be my favourite meat, but I enjoyed this a lot.

Cheese course! Colston Basset Stilton tart with white chocolate, a gel of either quince or apple I think (sorry, forgot here!) and lemon verbena flowers. Sounds crazy, I was sceptical, but it in fact worked incredibly well, especially alongside the port served with it. 

(Not pictured). A citrus pre-dessert with a variety of citruses from a farm near the Pyrenees that they were very proud to source from, which were expressed in the form of a curd on the base and a topping of east-Asian style shaved ice. In between the two of these was Sauternes jelly. A dusting of kaffir lime leaf finished the dish off. Refreshing!

An artful and complex dessert which I struggle to remember the full composition of. A chocolate mousse, chocolate sphere, miso caramel fudge, salted Jerusalem artichoke, hazelnut and a coffee sabayon - I think! It was great anyway. I might have liked to get the Jerusalem Artichoke flavour over a tiny bit more, but then I am one of these people who prefers my dessert to be invaded by bits of herbs and vegetables which I know is controversial. 



And then downstairs for plus fours and digestifs! I am not going to go into great detail on these - they were notably excellent - but as you may have guessed from talking about the dessert above, sweets are never the highlight of my meal. I will mention briefly the 70+ per cent dark chocolate tart served just melted with smoked olive oil, as well as the little draws with a bewildering variety of other little treats you can see in the last pic (matcha tart may have been my favourite, though there was also a pretty cool hay caramel and a cobnut praline. 

Overall a stellar meal. High quality ingredients, technically spot-on cooking, some invention, and superb saucing that will stick with me. Finances permitting I am keen to get back as soon as the next menu is launched. The dinner is not cheap, at ¬£250 for food alone, but I would say it is worth it. I preferred Row on 5 to, for instance, The Ledbury, which is pretty good going after such a short time and I am sure the Michelin inspectors will be back with at least one more star next year.

Dear \[Agent‚Äôs Name\],

I am seeking representation for my suspense novel, *Echoes in the Snow* (approximately 65,000 words). Blending the brutal reality of survival with an emotional journey of self-discovery and loss, this suspenseful novel will appeal to readers of both survival fiction and literary drama‚Äîespecially fans of *The Crash* by Freida McFadden and *The Great Alone* by Kristin Hannah.

Olivia Hart never expected to see Jace Mendoza again, let alone be trapped in a car with him. But when a blizzard strands them in the remote Wyoming mountains on the way to a mutual friend‚Äôs wedding, the past they‚Äôve both tried to bury resurfaces with a vengeance. Jace, a former soldier who once shattered Olivia‚Äôs heart, is now her only shot at survival. But as the frigid conditions turn deadly, old wounds reopen, and Olivia must decide if she can trust the man who once walked away.

With dwindling supplies, treacherous terrain, and the relentless cold closing in, Olivia and Jace must rely on each other to make it out alive. But survival means more than just enduring the storm‚Äîit means facing the truths that tore them apart. And when Jace falls dangerously ill, Olivia is forced to confront the one thing scarier than losing him before: losing him for good.

I am the self-published author of *Under the Sweet Gum Trees*, a young adult contemporary novel that explores themes of emotional abuse and depression. Since its publication, I have sold over 200 copies and gained valuable experience navigating the publishing process and engaging with readers.

Sincerely,  
strawberryshortycake

Maria was my first friend when I started teaching. We were both first-year teachers, fresh out of college, thrust headfirst into the chaotic world of kindergarten at Willow Creek Elementary School. It was the kind of chaos that forced you to trauma bond, and that is exactly what we did. We became close friends by navigating the tangled web of lesson plans, parent-teacher conferences, and the almost never-ending energy of five-year-olds.

In those days, Maria and I worked closely together, trading classroom management tips, sharing creative bulletin board ideas, and staying late to create miniature wonderlands in our classrooms. Weekends became our lifeline‚Äîcheap wine, venting, and a much-needed escape from the endless demands of our new career. The other teachers noticed our bond almost immediately. If someone spotted one of us walking the halls alone, they inevitably teased, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your partner in crime?‚Äù It became a running joke, but there was truth behind it.

1j1gojs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1j1gojs/how_to_practice_gratitude_for_a_happier_life/,How to Practice Gratitude for a Happier Life,"Gratitude is a powerful emotion that can transform the way we perceive our lives. By focusing on the positive aspects of our existence, we shift our mindset and invite more happiness into our everyday experiences. When practiced regularly, gratitude can improve your mental well-being, foster stronger relationships, and increase overall life satisfaction. But how can we cultivate gratitude in our daily lives? Here are a few simple yet impactful ways to practice gratitude and lead a happier life.

# 1. Start a Gratitude Journal

One of the easiest and most effective ways to practice gratitude is by keeping a gratitude journal. Each day, take a few moments to write down three things you're grateful for. These can be big or small‚Äîperhaps a supportive friend, a delicious meal, or the warmth of the sun. The key is to focus on the positive moments that bring joy or peace to your life. Over time, this simple ritual can shift your perspective, helping you notice and appreciate the good things that might otherwise go unnoticed. A gratitude journal is a reminder that even on challenging days, there is always something to be thankful for.

# 2. Express Your Appreciation to Others

Gratitude isn‚Äôt just something you feel‚Äîit‚Äôs something you can share. Take time each day to express appreciation to the people around you. Whether it‚Äôs a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to a colleague, a heartfelt note to a friend, or a loving word to a family member, expressing gratitude strengthens your relationships and spreads positivity. When you acknowledge the kindness and efforts of others, you not only uplift their spirits but also cultivate a sense of connection that enriches your own life. Gratitude is contagious, and by sharing it, you create a ripple effect of kindness and joy.

# 3. Focus on the Present Moment

In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it‚Äôs easy to overlook the small joys around us. Practicing gratitude means pausing and savoring the present moment. Whether it‚Äôs enjoying a cup of coffee, taking a walk in nature, or spending time with loved ones, bring your full attention to the experience. Notice the details, breathe in the sights and sounds, and embrace the moment with appreciation. By shifting your focus to the here and now, you can cultivate gratitude for life‚Äôs simple pleasures and experience more contentment in the present.

# 4. Reframe Negative Thoughts

Gratitude is a powerful tool for changing the way we think. When negative thoughts arise‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs frustration at a challenging situation or dissatisfaction with our current circumstances‚Äîtry to reframe them with a gratitude-focused mindset. For example, instead of focusing on what you lack or what‚Äôs not going right, consider what lessons or opportunities the situation might bring. Gratitude allows you to shift your perspective, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and learning. This positive outlook can help reduce stress and increase your sense of control, ultimately leading to greater happiness.

# 5. Practice Mindfulness

Mindfulness and gratitude go hand in hand. Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the moment, and it can enhance your ability to notice and appreciate the good things around you. Whether you‚Äôre eating a meal, talking to a friend, or just sitting quietly, being mindful helps you tune into your senses and experience life with greater awareness. By cultivating mindfulness, you naturally increase your capacity for gratitude. You begin to appreciate the richness of each moment, which in turn boosts your happiness and mental well-being.

# 6. Create a Gratitude Ritual

Incorporating gratitude into your daily routine can be a simple yet powerful way to make it a consistent practice. Consider creating a gratitude ritual that fits seamlessly into your day. This could be as simple as taking a few moments in the morning to express thanks for a new day or reflecting on the things you're grateful for before going to bed. By turning gratitude into a habit, it becomes easier to maintain a positive mindset and integrate appreciation into all areas of your life. Over time, this ritual will have a lasting impact on your happiness and overall well-being.

# 7. Volunteer or Give Back

Another meaningful way to practice gratitude is by giving back to others. Volunteering your time, skills, or resources can help you gain perspective on the things you often take for granted. Helping others in need fosters a sense of purpose and reinforces your appreciation for what you have. When you give back, you not only enrich someone else‚Äôs life but also deepen your own sense of gratitude for the blessings in your life. This act of kindness not only enhances your happiness but also strengthens the sense of community and interconnectedness.

# Conclusion

Practicing gratitude is one of the most powerful ways to enhance your happiness and improve your mental well-being. By focusing on the positive, expressing appreciation to others, and incorporating gratitude into your daily routine, you can shift your perspective and invite more joy into your life. Remember, gratitude is a practice, not a one-time event, and with regular attention, it can help you cultivate a deeper sense of contentment and fulfillment. So start today‚Äîexpress your thanks, embrace the present moment, and watch your life transform for the better.",1,1740883182.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

As someone who is a lost son of the Celts, O'Brien was easily my favorite regular cast member on DS9. He had a large number of great moments over the course of the show's 7 seasons, and even beyond the show's timeline as well. For myself, there's so many good moments that it's impossible to choose just one. One of my favorite moments was in ""Image in the Sand"" when he got drunk with Worf, trying to figure out why he was so upset‚Äîand then the next day he's at Quark's with Bashir and Quark, clearly hung over, drinking coffee. He even *looked* hung over! I love those scenes because they were so close to real life.

The next moment was outside of Deep Space Nine, but another favorite O'Brien moment for me was him and Capt. Ben Maxwell singing ""The Minstrel Boy"" together. That solemn moment as he talked down Maxwell was very powerful.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j1ghtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j1ghtj/my_mom_constantly_comments_on_my_eating_habits/,My mom constantly comments on my eating habits and it's making me paranoid.,"Hello Reddit. I need some advice on how to navigate this.

I never had the healthiest lifestyle. Growing up I'd constantly skip breakfast and then have chocolate or snacks at school, then coming home me and my brother weren't huge fans of fruits and veggies, so our parents would cook more meat based meals. Still, my weight was average, sometimes underweight, maybe because I'd drink tons of water and would eat quite modestly, not sure. In any case, even here my eating habits were not a concern, not for me or my family.

Fast forward a couple years I started dating a man who was a bit overweight, and being both food lovers we would eat a lot of junk stuff. At the time I graduated school, which meant no PE classes anymore. At this time I had gained some weight; not a lot for me to be considered overweight, but enough to have some belly showing, and people noticing. Both my boyfriend at the time and my mother have expressed their desire for me to lose weight, so I could recover the great body proportions I had as a teenager.

Fast forward again, I'm no longer dating this person, but my mom has upgraded her weight concerns to health concerns. I was no longer eating as much junk food as before, but I wasn't quitting it completely. At the time I was a young unemployed adult still living under my parent's roof, and my diet had become a bit more ""boring"" I would say. Things like plain meat with no side dish and dry chicken. I would ask her for something else to eat, like cereals, and she would refuse to buy it because they were too unhealthy. It was her money, so I couldn't complain, but this did sort of accumulate.

So of course when I got a job, I bought all the snacks and foods I actually wanted to eat. Chocolate cereal, chicken nuggets, candies, etc. Basically got that whim out. Despite this I didn't binge, I still have a lot of candy left from a bag I got last year, the cereal box is unopened in favor of a sugar free option, and fast-food restaurants are too expensive so I only buy there once a month at most. Still, this doesn't mean I've quit all these unhealthy foods completely.

At the same time, my mom got an Instagram account. She's been wanting to lose weight for quite some time so she follows a lot of nutrition accounts and such. And this is where our issue begins.

She wants me to quit all these foods completely. Nearly every day she comes up with a new food that I should avoid eating. First it was the obvious ones, like McDonald's and fried foods. Then it was bread, pasta, anything that uses flour. Then cereal, I don't know why but they are unhealthy according to her. Then chicken, because they inject chicken with hormones to make them bigger and thus should not be eaten. Rice, only one specific kind of it. Salt and butter are literal poison. And the most recent one, sugar causes cancer. She also sent me a video of how salmon is toxic to our bodies.

And now, the problem with it is that these comments started to get to me. I've been having health anxiety for a few years, and this is making it worse. Whenever I eat something I shouldn't, I start to worry that I'm going to die soon. Because sugar was the most recent I now have an issue with sugar. Should I put sugar on my tea or just learn to like it bitter? Should I drink chocolate milk? If it's 98¬∫F outside, do I buy some ice-cream or forget it because it has too much sugar, even if I eat a little bit?

Overall I don't think I'm an unhealthy person. I have incorporated more greens into my diet, I love beans, I much prefer water to any other kind of soda, I have reduced my coffee consumption to a minimum, I'm eating a lot more fruits than when I was a teen, I'm trying to eat less just to lose weight, and I'm about to start exercising. But at the same time I haven't quit all the unhealthy foods, I still eat pasta, I still get myself chocolate, ice cream, cookies, chips, hotdogs. And I'm terrified that this is not enough, and that I'll make myself sick from not quitting everything.

So the advice I'm asking for is, how can I get a healthy relationship with food, while ignoring my mom's comments about how every piece of food can kill me? Or maybe she's completely right and I should learn to control my cravings, in which case, how to do that, when certain foods are what I look for to mitigate my anxiety?",1,1740882593.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

If you're interested in the first half of the reviews you can find them [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/s/nW1LtlyAHf)

üíóüíóüíó

**Match Made in Heaven** - *Matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood* 

**Rating:** (3/5)

Mmmm this is pretty! Matcha powder mixed into vanilla ice cream served in a freshly made wafflecone. Yep it's what it says on the tin! Historically I have not liked matcha (neither in perfumes or beverages), but this matcha note is less bitter and grassy than others I've tried. I can smell a hint of floral cherry blossoms and a delicate almond note that doesn't overpower everything else like I find it has a tendency to do for me in other scents. It's sugary; not in a way that'll make your teeth hurt, but just enough to treat yourself with! Just like 2am in Lafayette is the best coffee scent I've tried, I'd say this is the best matcha, but as pretty as it is I think I would like to smell this in the air rather than wear it myself.

**A Witch's Valentine** - *Raspberry puree, Turkish, Moroccan, and Bulgarian rose absolutes, marshmallow, sugar, white chocolate, suede.*

**Rating:** (4/5)

This scent feels like a fuzzy pink heart-shaped pillow! Delicate and velvety roses laid over raspberry jam, topped with sugar and soft marshmallows. It's hard not to feel giddy sniffing this, it's just so unabashedly lovely! The suede adds an interesting sort of buttery texture. White chocolate is not very detectable to me until it starts to dry where the scent then becomes more creamy, finally settling down into a sweetened suede. I usually don't care much for rose (it's not a hated note, just not a love) but this one is so well done I could see myself reaching for it occasionally, whenever I'm in the mood to feel luxuriously romantic and pink! I would consider grabbing a bottle of this one if I pan the sample.

**String of Light in the Forest** - *Vanilla milkshake, Haitian vetiver, lavender maillette, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, Ambroxan*

**Rating:** (3/5)

This is vanilla milkshake right up front, it's delicious and makes me want to locate the nearest ice cream shop asap! The amber and beeswax are rich and chewy, both giving the feel that the perfume is glowing from within. After a few minutes I start to notice a slight powderyness beneath the edible vanilla and a soft cozy lavender, which is more sweet than herbal. As it dries it becomes muskier and the vanilla becomes less intense, leaving the beeswax and golden amber glow, but it still remains a foodie scent for me. This is the only oil sample I have in my haul and I must note that this oil is strong - I can still smell it after a hot shower. If you like gourmand vanilla/amber scents I think you will love this, but I just know it's going to make me crave ice cream every time I wear it.

**English Major** - *Library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis hamiltonii absolute*, carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves*

**Rating:** (3/5)

Initial thought - yep that's marshmallow alright! Most marshmallow notes have not worked for me, but this has the right balance of sweet to powdery for my nose. There's also the texture of paper and a gentle cool airiness, but the initial phase is mainly marshmallow and orris. Sandalwood becomes more detectable in the drydown and the carrot seed adds an interesting, violet-like element to the scent that begins to take over. It's only subtlety earthy to my nose and sweet, but not as sweet as some of the others have been. It's quite nice, but ultimately not for me. 

**Moon Magic** - *Lavender sugar, Tonka bean, chai spices, vanilla steamed milk, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight.*

**Rating:** (4/5)

Sweetened lavender and warm chai mingle in the opening of this perfume. Lavender is typically not my favorite (I've been saying this a lot haven't I?) but I'm enjoying it here, it's pleasant and dreamy and not as herbaceous as it can be. The vanilla milk, more vanilla than milk to my nose, adds a creamy element that slowly warms up the longer it wears. Dairy notes can often read as sour to me, but this stays firmly sweet. Underneath the sweetness is a musky fuzziness, the texture of cashmere that grows stronger as it dries. This would be lovely as a bedtime scent; it feels like it's lulling me into a gentle sleep.

**Snow Moon Magic** - *Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord), marshmallow, cookie butter, and Tahitian vanilla.*

**Rating:** (3/5)

I sprayed Moon Magic and Snow Moon Magic on opposite wrists at the same time for a side by side comparison. SMM subdues the lavender of MM, drops some mini marshmallows into the warm cup of chai, and sets a plate with a pile of cookies down next to it. Then a fan is put next to those cookies to blow the delicious smell toward you, drawing you in nose first like some kind of cartoon. Cookies! Did I mention cookies? Man I want a cookie. Out of the two I prefer Moon Magic because that cookie note is gonna be too distracting for me!

üíóüíóüíó

To summarize, there are two scents I absolutely loved and will be full-sizing (likely in both EDP and oils for layering): Sit for a Spell and The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake - cannot express how much I love those two lol. Some runner-ups were A Witch's Valentine, Moon Magic, Dreaming Evil, Serpentine, and Your Girlfriend is a Badass. Overall I did not dislike any of the samples and will keep them all in my collection as a special reminder/scent memory of a fun day. 

I'm so glad I got the chance to try all of these and see what the buzz was about. I can confidently say Sorce is worth the hype! I was pleasantly surprised to find a gourmand I could really love, and many examples of notes I usually dislike done in ways I couldn't help but enjoy. Sorce really has a magic touch!

1j1g84w,https://www.reddit.com/r/quickbooksonline/comments/1j1g84w/reconciling_your_quickbooks_accounts_a_guide_to/,Reconciling Your Quickbooks Accounts: A Guide to Keeping Your Sanity,"**Picture this:** you, a mountain of coffee cups, and a QuickBooks Online reconciliation screen that looks like a battlefield of numbers. Sound familiar? If you're ready to trade the chaos for clarity, I've put together a guide to help you conquer the reconciliation beast. It's like a survival manual for anyone who's ever tried to reconcile their accounts while running on caffeine and sheer willpower.  
  
Let's dive in:

I. **Preparation: Brew the Extra Strength with Espresso**

1. **Gather Your Statements:**
   * Obtain your bank or credit card statement for the period you want to reconcile.
      * Some banks will automatically import transactions into QBO but most you'll have to get manually.
   * Ensure the statement is for a specific, closed period (e.g., the end of the month).
2. **Verify Your Starting/Beginning Balance:**
   * In QBO, go to the ""Transactions"" tab and select ""Reconcile""
   * Select the account you want to reconcile from the ""Account"" dropdown.
   * Compare the beginning balance on your statement to the beginning balance in QBO.
      * If they don't match, you'll need to investigate and correct the discrepancy before reconciling.
      * There may be a message that shows ""We can help you fix it."" in blue above the account selection.
      * If you click this, it will show the changes in previously reconciled transactions that are throwing off the balance.
      * There could also be an issue with the opening balance of the account that may need adjustment.
3. **Ensure All Transactions Are Entered:**
   * Before you begin, enter all transactions (deposits, payments, fees, etc.) that occurred during the statement period into QBO.
      * If you have your bank account connected in QBO, make sure all transactions have been categorized for the period you are reconciling.
      * If there are transactions in the ""For Review"" section, they will not show in the reconciliation as they have not been added to the ledger.
   * Double-check for any missing or incorrect entries.
4. **Resolve Outstanding Transactions:**
   * If you have any transactions that have been lingering for a long time, investigate and resolve them. This could involve contacting your bank or reviewing your records.
   * You may find it easier to finish the reconciliation and see which transactions have remained unreconciled from previous periods.

II. **The Mind Bender - The Reconciliation Process**

1. **Start the reconciliation while continuing to breath:**
   * In QBO, go to the ""Accounting"" or ""Transactions"" tab and select ""Reconcile.""
      * You can also click the ""Gear Icon"" then ""Reconcile"" under the Tools column.
   * Choose the account you want to reconcile from the ""Account"" drop-down menu.
   * Enter the ""Ending balance"" from your statement.
   * Enter the ""Ending date"" from your statement.
   * Enter the ""Service Charge"" and ""Interest Earned"" information from the bank statement if applicable. If you do not enter this information here, you can enter it into the register later.
   * Click ""Start reconciling.""
2. **Match what's on the statement to the transactions in the register:**
   * QBO will display a list of transactions that are in the ledger/register for the selected period.
      * Please make sure that the filters are selected correctly to include all relevant transactions.
      * Recommendation: Clear filters, then unselect all the transactions by using the top button. (There are often transactions already selected and can throw your balance off.) Then reapply filters for the period of the reconciliation.
   * Carefully compare each transaction on your statement to the transactions in QBO.
      * Recommendation: Start with the deposits to verify there is the correct amount of them in QBO since most statements show total amount of deposits. (Click the ""Deposits"" tab)
   * Check the box next to each transaction in QBO that matches a transaction on your statement.
      * Recommendation: Start at the beginning of the month and work to the end.
   * As you check off transactions, the ""Difference"" at the top of the screen will decrease.
3. **Address discrepancies and don't breakdown:**
   * Transactions on the statement but not in QBO:
      * Click ""Add"" within the reconciliation screen to enter the missing transaction.
      * If your account is connected, check the ""Bank Transactions"" tab, For Review section.
   * Transactions in QBO but not on the statement:
      * These are usually outstanding transactions. If they remain outstanding for too long, investigate them.
      * These are usually checks that have been written but not processed yet.
   * Incorrect amounts:
      * Edit the transaction in QBO to match the correct amount from your statement.
   * Duplicate transactions:
      * Investigate and delete the duplicate transaction in QBO.
4. **Finish the reconciliation and try not to cry tears of joy:**
   * Once you've matched all transactions, the ""Difference"" at the top of the screen should be $0.00.
   * Click ""Finish now.""
   * QBO will display a reconciliation report. You can choose to view, print, or save this report.

**III. Find out why your hair is being pulled out**

* Common Reconciliation Problems:
   * Incorrect starting balance: Double-check your starting balance and correct it if necessary.
   * Verify there is no error when starting the reconciliation due to deleted or edited transactions.
* Missing transactions: Ensure all transactions are entered into QBO
   * Confirm all transactions in the ""For Review"" section have been added to the register for that period.
* Incorrect transaction amounts and dates: Verify the amounts and dates of all transactions.
   * If you have a transaction that is missing, you can search it in the main search to check if it has been entered into QBO and verify it has the correct amounts and dates.

* **Best Practices:**
   * Reconcile your accounts regularly (at least monthly).
   * Keep accurate records of all transactions.
   * Investigate any discrepancies immediately.
   * Save and review your reconciliation reports.
   * Use bank feeds to automate transaction entry, but still reconcile. ¬†
* **Using Bank Feeds:**
   * Bank feeds can automatically import transactions into QBO, saving you time.
   * However, it's still essential to reconcile regularly to ensure accuracy.
   * Review and categorize downloaded transactions carefully and on a regular basis. ¬†
* **Reconciliation Reports:**
   * These reports provide a detailed record of your reconciliation.
   * Save and review these reports regularly for auditing purposes. ¬†
* **Undoing a Reconciliation:**
   * It is possible to undo a reconciliation, but it is not recommended unless absolutely necessary. Be aware that undoing a reconciliation can cause a lot of issues and has to be done by an accountant user.

By following these steps, you can confidently reconcile your accounts in QBO and maintain accurate financial records. If you have questions or if anything here is unclear, please leave a comment or reach out, and I'll gladly help explain more.

Only to find out that the fanon character is completely different from canon, and now whenever you see the character in fanfics be fanon instead of canon, you‚Äôre like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù and I hate that Ik it‚Äôs wrong. 

For example, for me I got into Batman/DC universe by fanfiction. The way Tim Drake is characterized is that he never sleeps, loves his coffee, where it‚Äôs the only thing he‚Äôll ingest, and has no friends/is a loner. Only to find out, that canonically he doesn‚Äôt drink coffee and has tons of friends. He‚Äôs actually quite popular and has the most friends of the batfam. I just read a fanfic where Bruce is de-aged and is slowly getting his memories back and Tim says he has some friends, namely the Teen Titans. And Bruce is like ‚Äúwhaaa?? My baby has friends? I‚Äôm pretty sure I could count the number of friends he used to have on one hand with fingers left over‚Äù. And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not true, he canonically has so many friends and is loved by a lot of ppl.
