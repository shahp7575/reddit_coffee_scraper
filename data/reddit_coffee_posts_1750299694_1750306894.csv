I just realized that I overbooked my booths. Initially, I imagined that 4 of the souvenir suppliers will fit sa loob ng hall na napili ko. But I kept on watching mga weddings on that hall, and sa likod yung caterer 'cause wala nang space sa gilid (ito yung nasa imagination ko). So, ang mangyayari sana, all the food suppliers - sa holding area, and the souvenir suppliers, sa loob ng hall. Pero ayun mukhang hindi pwede.

Kasya naman siguro ito no?

Souvenir Suppliers: 
- Soap supplier 
- Leather stamping
- Studio Booth
- Photobooth (kasama sa package, I don't wanna remove - but I have an option to upgrade to photoman)

Food suppliers:
- Grazing table
- Pinoy themed booth
- Taho
- Potato Corner
- Coffee Bar
- Desserts bar 
- Mobile bar 

I think pwede ko ipilit na yung mobile bar is sa loob para di na lalabas ang guests to get their alak. Plus the studio booth para masulit pero parang gusto ko na din sya sa labas ü•≤ I know the others will probably get ubos na before the reception starts so okay lang sa labas sila.

1lf1mdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1lf1mdh/i_cant_even_wake_up_when_i_wanna_wake_up/,I can‚Äôt even wake up when I wanna wake up,"my mom still won't let me keep my laptop and phone in my room and I have to give them to her at night even tho im 19 and i slept with them in my room while I was away at college. This is literally just bc I used to watch YouTube and movies at night when I  was younger and she thinks I spend too much time on my phone. Which I do, but only because school is over and I don't have a job because we're leaving for a month and she doesn't let me do much else. 

I said I was gonna bike around when I first finished with school but then she was like you can only bike in front of the house. Hello. And she's like that if I wanna go anywhere alone. When I was at uni I went loads of places alone and I was perfectly fine. And if I hang out with friends she doesn't like it, first off, and second off she calls me eight billion times to come home and I'll convince her to give me half an hour more and then she'll call again ten minutes later telling me I better come home now. And today I said I was gonna hang out with my friend tomorrow and she was like why? And she never agreed to let me go. And then both of my parents try to force me to take my sister with me everywhere. My sister is 12 and all of my friends are 19 like me.

And then I told her to wake me up early tomorrow because im not allowed to keep my phone even if it's to set an alarm, so I have to always ask her to wake me up and hope she actually does it and she was like why so you can use your phone longer? She acts like all I care about is my phone just because I don't wanna talk to her because she always turns everything into a thing about religion and I hate this stupid religion and I don't believe in any of this stupid make believe stuff. 

And I don't even like going outside because I have to always dress how her and my dad want me to and how they want me to dress is ridiculous. I could wear jeans with no rips and a shirt with full sleeves and it would still make them unhappy. One time she found me with my shirt tucked in at school and she literally hit me over it. I don't wanna look like a freak and I feel stupid and ugly because I can't even dress how I want to. And I just never go clothes shopping because she hates everything I like and then I can't buy it. And she's always taking stuff out of my closet that she thinks is too short for me and giving it to my sister. 

This is a really stupid post but I just wanna make some of my own decisions. Every choice I make has to go through her first, even if it's something as small as what time I go to bed and what time I wake up. The other day my dad started insisting I go to bed at ten and wake up at four. I have nothing to do at four in the morning. 

Also my dad spends all day on his computer NOT working just watching YouTube and movies so how is that any different. And allllll days he's like ""make me breakfast/lunch/dinner"" ""make me coffee"" ""take my dishes away"" even tho he's not doing anything important bc he's off work rn.

When we first moved away from my family in December we started having a consistent argument about him just not listening to me. (My feeling my thoughts or feelings) that came to a head when I said I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôm going insane and he needs to fix it or I‚Äôm leaving (I know I‚Äôm definitely in the wrong for the ultimatum but I was tired of almost 6 months of begging for one thing) and he promised he would do better. I also told him I‚Äôm not going to be second to a man (his best friend) and he promised he would change that

Fast forward to now I found out I‚Äôm pregnant (not planned but wanted) on the 14th of June. I tried to tell him and he said ‚Äòfunky‚Äô and fell asleep. It hurt my feelings but I ignored it. It then came to he went to help the friend with a project at work and when he got off he offered for us to go to lunch, I said yes and got dressed. His friend lives down the road (10 mins) and 40 minutes passed, I texted and called to see if he was alright and he sent me to voicemail without reading my texts. This is a pretty consistent thing and I just got fed up with it. I told him to forget picking me up and that I‚Äôm taking a nap. He came home and asked what was wrong and I told him why I was upset. He didn‚Äôt give a clear answer as to why he ignored me for 40 minutes and brushed it off. 


A little later in the day we‚Äôre running errands and he stops at a coffee shop for drinks and completely ignores me. He didn‚Äôt ask or offer a drink (I feel bad when I ask for things, he knows this so he usually offers) and by the time he noticed I was mad he was already paying, I said it‚Äôs not worth opening another bill and to just leave. 

As I stated above I‚Äôm pregnant (no clue how far along but it‚Äôs kicking my ass) he smokes weed regularly and I‚Äôve asked him to not hit his pen in the house, or in the car as it makes me nauseous. And he still does it. I have a calcium deposit under my kneecap (1/8th the size of my kneecap) so walking for too long hurts to an agonizing point. He will literally tell me I‚Äôm overreacting when I say I‚Äôm in pain and need to sit down or get a scooter to finish shopping, I just go with it because I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene. 

How do I tell him that I don‚Äôt like the way he‚Äôs treating me? How do I tell him the way he‚Äôs treating me isn‚Äôt okay? Is this normal? Am I just looking too far into it and causing issues for no reason? ",1,1750306613.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

FM advise needed,"Apologies, but this post keeps getting taken down from the dating and dating advice Reddit.  So I'm posting it here.

Hi everyone,
I feel pretty embarrassed and discouraged right now, and hoping to get honest feedback ‚Äî especially from women ‚Äî to help me understand what I might have done wrong in this situation.

Dating apps have been frustrating, so I‚Äôve been trying to meet people more organically. There‚Äôs a really cute, upbeat girl who works at a coffee shop inside a major retailer. I‚Äôve gone in maybe once or twice a week over the past month and a half, sometimes grabbing a drink while helping my friend who does food delivery orders.

I had a few brief, friendly exchanges with her, nothing intense or ongoing. But today I decided to give her a note instead of trying to talk while she was working ‚Äî I genuinely didn‚Äôt want to put her on the spot in front of others or make her uncomfortable, that‚Äôs why I decided to give her a note instead.  The note just asked if she‚Äôd like to go for a walk in the park or maybe axe-throwing sometime (I figured coffee wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea since she makes it all day). I included my number.

She smiled, said thank you, that it was sweet, and told me she‚Äôs been busy lately but would text me if she‚Äôs free.

That should have been the end of it ‚Äî but not long after, while I was helping my friend in another section of the store, a man came up to me and asked if I was [my name]. He pulled me aside and showed me the note I‚Äôd given her.

He started questioning me ‚Äî ‚ÄúDo you think this is appropriate?‚Äù He told me that the girl said I‚Äôd been coming in and making her uncomfortable. He asked if the woman I was with (my friend) was my girlfriend and how would he like it if I showed the note to her, and (he did and even told her what I had done).

He then banned me from the store for a year and said if I come back, I‚Äôll be arrested.

I walked out feeling completely humiliated. My friend was almost trespassed too, just for being with me. I feel confused, angry, and embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt think I was being creepy. I honestly thought giving a note was a more respectful option than putting someone on the spot at work. Her initial response made me think she appreciated that.

What hurts the most is that she said something kind to my face, made it seem as if she was mildly interested, then went to security. I get that people are allowed to feel however they feel ‚Äî but I really wish I‚Äôd been given a chance to correct whatever I did wrong before it got escalated to this level.

I‚Äôm 45 and neurodivergent (Autism/ADHD), so sometimes I miss social cues. But I try very hard to be respectful.  My mom had severe mental illness from abuse and I‚Äôve always tried to be conscious of how I come across to women.

So I‚Äôm genuinely asking:
From a woman‚Äôs perspective, what did I miss here?
How could I have handled this better ‚Äî or should I just not try approaching women in person at all anymore?

I really appreciate any honest, kind advice.",1,1750306497.0,DatingHell,0,1.0,False

When he plugs the yellow cable (pic 3) in to port 1 WAN on the Hap ax3 and uses Winbox to connect to the MAC Address via Wi-fi or Ethernet, I notice in the 'internet' tab for the ""Quickset"" feature that it's set to Automatic Address acquisition, so it should just find the DHCP like it did mine.. right?

Seems to not be the case as it looks like his DSL is likely PPPoE (I don't know how to confirm) and needs to get credentials from his ISP, go to the internet tab in Winbox again, And manually enter in said credentials because Automatic doesn't work seem to work.

is that the fix? is there anyway we can get rid of the entire DSL set up from the starting point and switch it to something more modern? He bought this house recently and experiences a good amount of packet loss and a lot of buffer bloat considering he's in the middle of the city of Edmonton on a ""1gb/s"" internet plan.

1lf1frh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lf1frh/hm_i_invited_tom_cruise_to_my_wedding/,[HM] I Invited Tom Cruise to My Wedding,"I really shouldn‚Äôt have.

Except we had an extra invitation.

And I love the *Mission: Impossible* movies.

And I assumed he wouldn‚Äôt show and might send something expensive I could return for something cooler.

But he came.

Tailored suit. Sunglasses. I watched from the front of the church as he slipped in a side entrance and took the back row. He was joined by my creepy uncle Rick. Ponytail. Teva sandals. ‚ÄúGutentag,‚Äù Rick said as he took a sip of Irish coffee from a plastic travel mug.

Rick was oblivious. Everyone was. Unfortunately that wouldn‚Äôt last long. Because when the crowd stood and turned around for Jessica‚Äôs big entrance, they noticed Tom first, and began snapping photos of him while the bride walked past, largely ignored.

When Jessica reached the front of the church, she was already upset. ‚ÄúWhy is Tom Cruise here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI sort of invited him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou invited Tom Cruise to our wedding?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think he would come!‚Äù

Yet there he was. And the thoughtful ceremony meticulously scripted by my type-A fianc√©e was quickly tossed aside by our minister, a part time community theater actor, who took the arrival of our surprise guest as a green light to wedge as many Tom Cruise movie quotes as possible into the next forty-five minutes.

‚ÄúYour mission, if you choose to accept it, is to take this woman to be your lawfully married wife.‚Äù

‚ÄúNormally this is where I‚Äôd talk about the importance of honesty in marriage, but now I‚Äôm worried‚Ä¶ that you can‚Äôt handle the truth!‚Äù

Even at the end, when he gave me permission to kiss the bride, he tacked on a ‚ÄúSHOW ME THE MONEY!‚Äù (This made no sense whatsoever but received a big laugh.)

After the ceremony, Tom found us to say hello and apologize. ‚ÄúI was scheduled to be in town already and even though my agent thought I was nuts, I thought this might be a fun surprise but‚Ä¶ if you want me to go, I‚Äôm pretty good at disappearing.‚Äù

He was a true gentleman. But I couldn‚Äôt kick him out any more than Ren√©e Zellwegger could in *Jerry Maguire*. Dare I say, he had me at hello. ‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre our guest. I‚Äôm sure things will get less weird.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt.

Half an hour into the reception, my mother-in-law Denise was three mimosas deep and threw herself at Tom‚Äîwhom she repeatedly called ‚ÄúMaverick‚Äù‚Äîsaying quite loudly that she was in a ‚Äúloveless marriage with a troll‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours for the taking, flyboy.‚Äù

Tom gently excused himself to the men‚Äôs room.

When he emerged a few minutes later, my cousin Felix cornered him by the bar and tried to rescue him from Scientology. ‚ÄúI can keep you safe, Tom. I have guns.‚Äù

I ordered the DJ to turn up the music and get people dancing. This was a happy distraction until my best man tried to pull Tom onto the floor to serenade my new wife with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve Lost That Lovin‚Äô Feeling.‚Äù

But when Tom begged off with a friendly wave, my scorned mother-in-law grabbed the mic. ‚ÄúYou are no American treasure,‚Äù she began. ‚ÄúYou are nothing but a pampered Hollywood phony-baloney!‚Äù

That was when Jessica ran to a nearby storage closet and barricaded herself inside.

I pressed my face against the slit in the door. ‚ÄúJessica. Sweetheart. Please come out,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she answered.

I forced the door open an inch and saw her sitting on a dirty step stool next to a dirtier mop. Her eyes were red and puffy.

‚ÄúYou invite the biggest movie star in the world to our wedding without even telling me. And then after you see how he is *ruining* things and he kindly offers to leave, you let him stay!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs Tom Cruise.‚Äù

Then she screamed and kicked the door closed with her heel.

I slumped away and found Tom nursing a drink near the chocolate fountain.

‚ÄúWife‚Äôs mad, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAnd now she wants me to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe does. I‚Äôm really sorry.‚Äù

Tom nodded but didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ you should have taken me up on my offer when you had the chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúI beg your pardon?‚Äù

Tom put down his drink and smiled. It was a knowing smile. The same smile he gave every villain in *Mission: Impossible* right before he stabbed them in the neck or threw them off a roof. Except I wasn‚Äôt a villain. I was just a groom who had an extra wedding invitation.

Tom took a step closer. His cologne smelled expensive. ‚ÄúTell me if I have this straight,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúFirst you invite me to your wedding. Even though we‚Äôre not friends. Even though we‚Äôve never even met. You were probably hoping my agent would just send a gift. A gift you‚Äôd promptly exchange for something sad and meaningless. Like a Nintendo Switch. Or some limited edition Funko Pop.‚Äù

*How did he know I had my eye on a Funko Pop?*

He continued. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre the first stranger to invite me to something? Do you know how many weddings I get invited to? Random birthday parties? Bar Mitzvahs? Except‚Äîplot twist‚Äîthis time I show up. Thought it‚Äôd be fun. Except now you have a problem. Because your wife doesn‚Äôt want me here. Fair enough. But then comes our Act 2 complication. I refuse to leave. Which shines a light on the bigger issue. The thing I picked up on pretty quickly after observing you the last few hours. The thing everyone in this room has been worried about since the day they heard Jessica agreed to marry you. *Oh shit*, *she‚Äôs settling for a wuss.*‚Äù

Creepy Uncle Rick leaned in next to Tom and nodded, ‚ÄúGod damn truthteller right there.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe? I am not a wuss,‚Äù I said.

Then I looked beyond Tom and Uncle Rick. And I saw similar faces with similar expressions. Unspoken concerns that Jessica had settled. Sure, my creepy uncle could be wrong. And maybe even Tom Cruise. But everyone?

If I couldn‚Äôt be strong for Jessica on our wedding day, how could she expect me to defend her every day after that?

I lifted my chin and stared Tom down. ‚ÄúPlease leave,‚Äù I said.

He laughed. ‚ÄúWas that you trying to be tough?‚Äù

‚Äú*Now,*‚Äù I added.

‚ÄúNot very convincing,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúTell you what. I‚Äôll leave just as soon as I cut the cake.‚Äù Over on the dessert table, Tom eyed the long silver cake knife.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould I?‚Äù

We locked eyes. Tom clenched his teeth and his jawbones pulsed. And then, in a flash, we both lunged for it. I got my hands on the knife but so did Tom and we began to wrestle.

Family members who later analyzed the footage from their iPhones said Tom employed a combination of jiu-jitsu and Krav Maga whereas my strategy was simply to hold onto the knife with my hands and curl up in a ball like an armadillo.

Tom whipped me around, taking out tables and chairs as I spun. He unknowingly edged closer and closer to a puddle underneath our ice sculpture. When his Italian loafers reached it, he slipped and, for a brief second, lost his grip. That was all the time I needed. I took control of the dull pastry weapon and hurled it as far across the hotel ballroom as I could. It landed with a clank against Jessica‚Äôs great aunt Moira‚Äôs oxygen tank.

Tom tried to sprint after it but I grabbed his pant leg and held on. It wasn‚Äôt cinematic but it was effective.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a real man!‚Äù he yelled.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ AM!‚Äù I yelled back.

And with that, I grabbed the husband and wife figurine from on top of our wedding cake and jabbed the happy couple‚Äôs plastic heads into Tom Cruise‚Äôs left hamstring.

He screamed and collapsed in pain.

Acting on some ancient, long forgotten heroic instinct, I leapt on top of him and used my knees to pin his chiseled shoulders to the ground. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I did it. I had bested Tom Cruise in hand to hand combat.

From from my position of glory, I spotted Jessica across the ballroom. She wasn‚Äôt horrified. She was smiling. Proud. Next to her, Creepy Uncle Rick raised his Corona and mouthed a silent, ‚ÄúAtta boy.‚Äù

Back on the ground, Tom stopped resisting. He didn‚Äôt look defeated. He looked‚Ä¶happy. As if by failing, he had accomplished exactly what he wanted.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my cue‚Äù he said.

I helped him up and we walked him to his tinted black rental car. We didn‚Äôt speak another word. But he did shake my hand. And before he drove away, he handed me an envelope.

Inside was a handwritten note.

*To the Happy Couple ‚Äî*

*Marriage is hard. Dare I say‚Ä¶ almost impossible. But it‚Äôs worth it. So don‚Äôt ever give up. Remember to laugh at the funny parts. Cry during the sad parts. And, whenever possible, perform your own stunts.*

*Best wishes.*

*Tom*

1lf1f3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1lf1f3d/tifu_by_trying_to_be_a_cool_boss_and_accidentally/,"TIFU by trying to be a ""cool boss"" and accidentally starting an all-out prank war that HR now calls ""The Mayonnaise Incident.""","It all started with a simple, noble goal: boost team morale. I'm a new manager, and my team is great but a little quiet. I figured a harmless prank would break the ice. So, last week, I put our lead developer's stapler in a Jell-O mold, a classic. He laughed, the team laughed, it was a home run. Or so I thought.

This, apparently, was seen not as a one-off joke but as a declaration of war. The next day, I found my desk entirely wrapped in aluminum foil. Okay, fair play. I retaliated by changing everyone's computer background to a picture of a Nicolas Cage centaur. They responded by hiding 157 tiny plastic army men all over my office.

The escalation was rapid and terrifying. We're talking fake memos about mandatory ""synergy-building interpretive dance sessions,"" a coffee maker that was rigged to only brew decaf, and my car keys being frozen in a block of ice. It was getting out of hand, but it was still mostly fun.

The climax came yesterday. 
To get back at the developer who started the retaliation, I decided to go for the jugular. I bought a family-sized tub of mayonnaise, pried the case off his desk phone, and filled the entire handset with mayo. I then hot-glued the casing shut. I sat back, proud of my diabolical work.

What I didn't know was that our Regional Manager was visiting. And he needed to make an urgent call. From my developer's desk. You can imagine the scene: a man in a $2,000 suit picking up a phone and getting a geyser of lukewarm mayonnaise all over his face, shirt, and a stack of important-looking documents.

The silence that followed was broken only by the soft, wet plop of a dollop of mayo landing on his shoe. The prank war is over. I spent my morning in a three-hour meeting with HR, where they presented me with a new, zero-tolerance ""Workplace Conduct and Food-Based Assault"" policy.

TL;DR: TL;DR: I tried a harmless prank to boost team morale, which escalated into a multi-department prank war, ending with me explaining to HR why I hot-glued a tub of mayonnaise to my regional manager's phone.

That was me just a few months ago ‚Äî tipping the scale at **120 kilograms**, exhausted from crash diets and fake promises.

I felt like I was watching life pass by. Then, something clicked. I stumbled across a simple keto recipe that turned out to be *so much more than just food*. It became my *ritual*, my *first win*, and my *daily proof* that I *could* change.

  
ü•ë My Go-To Keto Breakfast: The Creamy Avocado & Egg Bowl

This low-carb breakfast helped me shift into fat-burning mode, stay full for hours, and most importantly ‚Äî *feel good* about what I was putting in my body.

# ‚ú® Why It Works (Besides Tasting Amazing)

* **Healthy fats** from avocado keep you satisfied and energized.
* **Eggs** offer high-quality protein without the carb crash.
* It's **super quick to make** (under 10 minutes!).
* No fancy ingredients ‚Äî *just real food that works.*

# üìù Ingredients (1 serving)

* 1 ripe avocado
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tbsp olive oil or grass-fed butter
* 1 tbsp chopped chives or spring onions
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Optional: ¬Ω tsp chili flakes or smoked paprika
* Optional: squeeze of lemon juice

# üî• Instructions

1. **Boil or Fry Your Eggs**
   * Soft-boiled (6‚Äì7 min) or pan-fried sunny-side-up ‚Äî your choice! I love the runny yolk mixing into the avo.
   * If pan-frying, heat a bit of olive oil or butter in a non-stick pan and cook eggs until whites are set.
2. **Prep the Avocado Base**
   * Cut your avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop it into a bowl.
   * Mash it gently with a fork (don‚Äôt overdo it ‚Äî we want creamy, not baby food).
   * Add salt, pepper, lemon juice, and chili flakes if you like a little kick.
3. **Assemble Your Bowl**
   * Place your eggs right on top of the mashed avocado.
   * Drizzle with olive oil or melted butter for an extra fat boost.
   * Sprinkle with chives/spring onions and paprika if using.
4. **Dig In and Feel the Power**
   * This dish not only tastes indulgent ‚Äî it *keeps cravings away*.
   * I pair it with black coffee or herbal tea for that morning zen.

But I‚Äôm scared to make some grammar mistakes

Anyways here is a sneak peak of the fic I‚Äôve been working on ( has 150 pages already ) . is an AU where Historia is an exchange student from America and Ymir is British , they both meet on Brighton at the same Uni

The room falls silent as Ymir breaks down in sobs, her body shaking with raw emotion as she buries her face against the blondes head. The others are stunned, never having seen such vulnerability from the usually tough and freckled girl. But Ymir couldn't care less,because the best thing that ever happened to her was returning to America. Ymir had always known that their time together was limited, that their paths were destined to diverge. Yet, no amount of preparation could shield her from the excruciating pain that now consumed her being.

""Promise me you'll call me when you land,"" Ymir choked out between tears, pressing one last kiss to Historia's head.The blonde only could nod

""We will see each other again,"" Historia promised with a trembling voice, trying to reassure both herself and Ymir. But deep down, they both knew it wasn't a guarantee. With one last longing look at each other,

With a heavy heart, Ymir watched as Historia disappeared into the crowd at the airport. The weight of her promise hung in the air, suffocating Ymir's already conflicted emotions.Ymir had always been known for her tough exterior and her ability to hide her vulnerability behind a sarcastic smile. But now, as she stood there, she couldn't hold back her tears any longer. The weight of the world seemed to crush her shoulders, each sob threatening to unravel the carefully constructed walls she had built around herself.

Every corner of the Terminal 3 of the Heathrow airport seemed to taunt her with reminders of what she was leaving behind. The scent of cinnamon from the bakery nearby brought back memories of lazy mornings spent intertwined in a mess of limbs and sheets. The distant sound of an announcement over the intercom echoed through the hallways like a haunting melody, whispering promises that now felt like distant echoes from another lifetime.

She ran from the group not wanting to face their questioning gazes or their pitying hugs. Sasha tries to follow her but Bertholdt stops her and says

''Don't go after her Sasha , she may want to be alone for a while. It's a lot to take in for her'' Says Bert softly

Sasha reluctantly nods, understanding Bertholdt's words. Ymir had always been fiercely independent and she knew that sometimes all a person needed was some space to process their emotions. But as the group stands in silence, watching Ymir's retreating figure, Mikasa speaks up. ""We should give her some time, probably she won't come to the flat until tomorrow.""

Ymir takes the tube not registering where she's going her mind clouded by grief and heartache. The rhythmic hum of the train lulls her into a sense of numbness, providing a temporary escape from the reality that awaits her at the flat. The jostling of the crowded carriage seems to mirror the chaos of her emotions, a turbulent symphony that drowns out the world around her.

As she steps off the train, Ymir finds herself in an unfamiliar part of London. Neon lights flicker and dance along the rain-soaked streets, casting an ethereal glow upon the city. The air is heavy with the scent of damp concrete and distant laughter, mingling with the faint aroma of brewing coffee from a Costa coffee nearby. Ymir stumbles upon a quaint little bar tucked away in a corner, its windows frosted with condensation. A dim glow spills out onto the wet pavement, inviting her in like a beacon in the night. She pushes open the creaky door, revealing a cozy interior adorned with vintage posters and flickering candlelight.

Ymir finds an empty stool at the worn wooden bar and takes a seat, feeling the soft cushion beneath her tired body.

""What can I get you?"" Asked the Young Bartender

""The strongest shit you've got"" Replies the Brunette

The young bartender, with a sympathetic look in his eyes, pours Ymir a generous shot of whiskey and slides it towards her. She takes a deep gulp, relishing the burning sensation that spreads through her body. ""Rough day?"" The bartender asks, wiping down glasses with a rag. Ymir nods, not trusting her voice to say more.¬†

Historia sat in the boarding area  her mind still spinning with the events of the past six months.She took out her phone and typed out a simple message to Ymir ""Miss you already,"" It's feel so surreal to go back home, Historia couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. She was going back to her homophobic parents. She was going back to being the perfect girl, the people pleaser, hiding her new true self.

As Historia boarded the plane, her heart felt heavy with the weight of deception. She glanced out the window, watching as the landscape of London disappeared beneath the clouds. The country that had once embraced her newfound identity now seemed distant and unreachable. At least she would have some free days with Frieda in New york after facing her reality in Utah

We got married really quickly after having met each other. It seemed like a perfect relationship in the beginning. And I know I have played a part in making him feel uncertain at times about our relationship. 

Now it‚Äôs gotten to the point where the past several months we get in arguments that turn physical and they are progressively getting more physical. 
He is bringing up things that have happened in the past and he does it every time we argue. When we get in arguments he hides the car key, house key etc. so I‚Äôm unable to leave. He will leave me stuck at the house for 12+hours. There‚Äôs times that he will ignore me for days. He‚Äôs shut the power off to our house for hours, broken multiple phones, cut up my license. 

When we end up talking it out it always gets brought up that I‚Äôm not fighting for him and I shut down. I know I do and I‚Äôve been working on it. It is hard to not shut down though when I feel constantly attacked. 

He didn‚Äôt like posts I was liking on social media so I got rid of all those accounts. I basically don‚Äôt talk to anyone including my family anymore. He said that I don‚Äôt set healthy boundaries with people. 

He has said quite a few times that when I‚Äôm sleeping he has thought about stabbing me with a knife in the thigh. He made a comment once about how I might just be the next Gabby Petito. 

Recently when we argue he has been saying ‚Äúyou know you‚Äôre not the only girl I can get‚Äù or tells me about how he goes to a coffee shop and someone gives him their number.

I guess I‚Äôm really just asking for advice. Do things get better? Can they? What would you do if you were in my position? I‚Äôm feeling very doubtful. I‚Äôm to the point that I‚Äôm so emotionally shut down and constantly in fight or flight mode. ",1,1750305785.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Background - Dad died when I was little, he was abusive, don‚Äôt miss him. I went no contact with his entire family about 3 years ago after a childhood of trying to establish a relationship with people who were very indifferent toward me. I have no alive siblings.

My mom has always been very critical of me. Especially weight. I was a kid who would get chubby and then have a growth spurt. She hated when I was chubby. I‚Äôd go to exercise classes from the age of 9, nothing wrong with that it‚Äôs good to be healthy but I knew it was because she hated having a chubby kid. I had an eating disorder in my early 20s which I didn‚Äôt think she knew about until a family friend told me she knew but didn‚Äôt help me through it or do anything about it (probably because I looked great according to her even though it‚Äôs given me life long health issues). A lot of food and weight stuff. Even now, I‚Äôm not overweight but I‚Äôm not thin. I do a lot of sport, maybe 9-10 hours of sport a week and she always sends me instagram reels of the sport I do but the videos are all of fat people doing my sport which I find bizarre and pointed? 

I had a sibling die when I was a teenager and within a month I was sent to one of those teen wilderness camps because I was ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Never a therapist or someone that could help me with my grief.

She kicked me out 2x when I was a teenager. The first time I was 16 and I didn‚Äôt talk to her for 8 months and she went to therapy (my terms of reconnection were that she go to therapy). She only did like 3 sessions and stopped when I came back into her life. The 2nd time she kicked me out I was 18 or 19 - of age it‚Äôs fine, But she kicked me out because she found my diary and read it and found out that I was dating a girl even though she denies it to this day and claims she kicked me out because I didn‚Äôt clean my room again.

Recently, I came to visit her. We live in different parts of the world and I was ready for this to be this pivotal moment where we become close and I forgive and forget and it starts the mark of us being close in adulthood. I am sentimental and I see her ageing and it just breaks my heart that I likely will only see her a handful of times in my lifetime because of the distance. She doesn‚Äôt hug me, I have to ask for initiate and she just jokes about how clingy and sappy I am. She also makes fun of me in front of other people, like a lot. I feel like the DUFF of my own mother. Recently, I lost my shit at her, sobbing on the street, finger pointed in her face. We had met people on vacation and she decided to use one of the worst moments of my life and make fun of me to these strangers about it. I gave her so many warnings to change the subject because I didn‚Äôt like where it was going and she didn‚Äôt. She laughed and said ‚Äúoh yeah, when her first boyfriend broke up with her I was talking her off balconies! Haha!‚Äù I said stop, I pinched her under the table because I was so embarrassed she was bringing up something so personal to these people we don‚Äôt know. She carried on ‚Äúyeah she used to call me at 2am saying she didn‚Äôt know if she could live through this‚Äù. We had a massive blow up argument about it, I cried. I told her she was my first bully. Her boyfriends kids don‚Äôt talk to him and I told her she can join his club if she keeps it up. Her eyes wet a little bit but she doesn‚Äôt cry and she gave me some bullshit vague line about how maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with her and I saw a glimmer of hope that this might be a turning point.

Nope.

She drinks a lot. I don‚Äôt think I realised how much she drinks until this recent trip to see her. 
My step dad was a drunk and would drive me drunk all the time, driving often on the wrong side of the road. Her boyfriend drinks, not as much but he‚Äôll easily have 5-6 drinks and drive us around and I‚Äôve said I‚Äôm not comfortable with it but I get no say. I‚Äôm not allowed to voice that I‚Äôm uncomfortable with it. 

Last night we were out drinking all day into the evening. It‚Äôs not my idea of fun. I‚Äôll have 2-3 max and I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm full, I‚Äôm tired, I feel dehydrated, and these are not my friends. I came to visit her 2 years ago and she dragged me around to all these peoples houses to go and drink and I told her then I didn‚Äôt like it and I even told her on this trip before I got off the plane that I don‚Äôt want to do that. I barely know these people. I asked we go home after 4 hours and we all piled into the car a good 45 minutes later with the tipsy driver and I think we‚Äôre going home. No. She‚Äôs texting her friends seeing who‚Äôs up. Before I know it we‚Äôre in her friends driveway who I don‚Äôt know. I sit in the car for 5 minutes before she comes out telling me to come inside and meet her friends. It‚Äôs 10pm on a Tuesday night and they‚Äôve got young kids. Just tacky and classless. I say I‚Äôm tired and I thought we were going home. She gets tipsy driver to drive me home and I sit in the guestroom and cry to my friends on the phone for an hour about how she doesn‚Äôt listen to me and ignores me. I sent her messages because I was really upset and I said stuff like I‚Äôm unhappy, I feel like you don‚Äôt listen to me, you don‚Äôt consider my feelings, etc. and her response is she‚Äôll take me to a mall tomorrow and we can shop. Even though less than a week ago my finger was in her face screaming ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt throw money at me and call it a relationship!!‚Äù 

This morning I kept myself in the guest room, she messaged me a few times about stupid stuff, she made a pot of coffee and was asking me if I was ready to go to the mall. After 5 hours she finally got the hint that I wouldn‚Äôt be replying to messages. She knocks on the door and comes in and goes ‚Äúwe need to go to the mall soon because there will be traffic on the way home‚Äù and I just look at her and tell her that I‚Äôm upset with her and she scoffs and goes ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still upset‚Äù like it‚Äôs an annoyance. We get into it, she immediately defensive and goes ‚Äúwell I made you a coffee and you ignored me‚Äù and tried to like be mad at me. And I really just lost it. It was like joker/Britney Spears madness. I just started manically laughing while crying. I knew what I had to do. I had enough. I was tired of constantly feeling like crap and having to get over her behaviour. I don‚Äôt want to get over anything. I want to be angry and crazy, because I feel crazy. She makes me feel insane. 

She would say insane shit to me and I just, screamed like I never screamed before. It was demonic and it felt amazing. I don‚Äôt think she realised what I was doing, she was still really defensive about the coffee I ignored and how ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always upset about something‚Äù. I started throwing laundry, trying to find all my clothes to pack up. She calls me a spoilt brat. Maybe I‚Äôm a brat but I‚Äôm sure not spoilt. I‚Äôm the opposite of spoilt, I‚Äôm starved. I continue packing, she‚Äôs still so clueless that I‚Äôm leaving and still on the defence she goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in court‚Äù !! For, what exactly? Throwing a dress out of the dryer? My dad had a wrongful death thing so I was awarded the settlement money but because I was a child my mom (they were divorced) was the keeper of it or something. I was supposed to get it when I turned 18. I didn‚Äôt even know about it until I was nearly 20. It‚Äôs been 9 years since it should have come into my possession and I still haven‚Äôt seen it and it‚Äôs a considerable amount. 

She says her boyfriend‚Äôs going to kick me out of the house and I laugh in her face and I tell her I‚Äôm nearly finished packing and that I‚Äôm going and then her whole demeanour changes.  She goes ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to go‚Äù even though seconds before she was threatening it. I yell more. And more and more. It felt so amazing. I tell her to enjoy her childfree life. I tell her she‚Äôs a terrible mother. I tell her she‚Äôs a drunk and she‚Äôs sending herself to an early grave. I tell her she doesn‚Äôt deserve me and I don‚Äôt deserve her. Her first time, initiating any physical touch with me is at this moment where she puts her hand on my leg and tries to hug me and I tell her to get the fuck off me. It feels manipulative, my whole life she‚Äôs known I love and crave hugs or just like any form of love because I‚Äôm so starved of it and the first time she tries to is because I‚Äôve yelled and screamed and thrown things and packed my bags and this is the first time in a long time she‚Äôs feels like she might actually lose me. Why can‚Äôt I have a hug because she just felt like it? Why did I have to beg for that?

I left. I cried. I cried so much. I checked into a hotel and passed out for 4 hours. Now I‚Äôm awake with my thoughts. I don‚Äôt regret anything I‚Äôve done or said. It‚Äôs all true but now I‚Äôm just mourning a relationship I never even had. I feel so robbed. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever get it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll see her at my wedding, I don‚Äôt think I will ever introduce her to my boyfriends parents, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever watch her become a grandma to my kids. She‚Äôs never going to do the work on herself.

I see people with big massive families, the family dinners, family holidays, the cousins are best friends, everyone loves their siblings and their parents and I‚Äôm so jealous. How can people have so much and I have so little?

Will probably delete this but I‚Äôm sad and I needed to vent to something that wasn‚Äôt chatgbt

Just because someone on the internet made something from scratch, don‚Äôt feel bad if you haven‚Äôt done the same for your children. Our moms may not have packed fancy lunch boxes, but every meal was filled with love.

Don‚Äôt watch vacation videos and feel like you‚Äôve missed out. Those are just promotions. 

Don‚Äôt compare your relationship with what you see online - real love doesn‚Äôt need to flower showers and diamond rings. It‚Äôs in the small moments - making your coffee, checking in if you reached work, bringing home your favorite snack. Those girls are rich whose husbands would fight the world for them rather than bashing their women in front of million people. 

Look at our parents - how they‚Äôve stayed together despite so many differences. That‚Äôs real love.

Their lives are not fancy rather messy - can‚Äôt think of acting in front of a camera 24*7 and be conscious every-time I step out. Unfollow all those beetches who make you feel any lesser - we need not stay relevant. Not if it‚Äôs compromising your mental health.

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?

kdramas nowadays are a lot more realistic and don‚Äôt rly have such whimsical plots like the ones in these dramas and while i don‚Äôt necessarily view that as a bad thing i still miss this genre so bad, specially since i am a big fan of shoujo myself.. it gets a lot of hate bcs of how the female leads were written back in the day which is understandable but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt have a modern kdrama w a better written lead that feels like a shoujo. yk modern shoujo manga and animes nowadays have changed too! anyway, what are some other kdramas that you think fit in this ‚Äúgenre‚Äù?",4,1750304907.0,kdramas,1,1.0,False

1lf11zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1lf11zq/finally_hpv_negative/,Finally HPV Negative,"Hey y'all, I wanted to share my HPV journey in case it helps anyone out there going through the same thing.

When I first found out I had high-risk HPV, I was devastated. I kept it to myself, cried myself to sleep. Reading and re-reading my pap smear and colposcopy report to the point of obsession, asking chatgpt to analyze it over and over again. Although I don't pity myself because I have been pretty irresponsible in my personal life. Reading other's stories on this subreddit gave me comfort and hope and now I want to do the same.

I'm a woman in my early 30s living in the U.S. I was first diagnosed in 2022. Before that I had a negative pap 4 years prior. My HPV type was in the high-risk category, but not types 16 or 18. I asked my gynaecologist if I could test for a specific strain but she said there are none available right now for that and it wouldn't help since all of those would just be treated the same way.

This is my timeline:

* Year 1: HPV positive. Dual stain test found no abnormal cells.
* Year 2: Still positive. Dual stain showed abnormal cells. Had my first colposcopy (CIN1). I broke down crying in a corner of the hospital right after my procedure.
* Year 3: Still positive again. Dual stain showed abnormalities, but colposcopy found nothing. 
* Year 4: Finally tested HPV negative!

Around year 3 is when I really started panicking because what I've been told is that normally it clears away within 2 years. I made lifestyle changes ‚Äî started running regularly. Before year 3 I also stopped drinking alcohol and stayed celibate for more than 2 years. I don‚Äôt smoke, have no other health concerns, and am generally in good shape. I didn't really cut down on sugar and coffee because I'm addicted to those and I just can't give it up but if you are super ambitious you can do it. I also didn't take any supplements. I think what really helped was running regularly?

I'm still a little anxious about the possibility of HPV returning so for now I'm going to keep up with my current health routine. I hope this helps whomever is reading this and know that you are not alone. Also appreciate the little things in life and be grateful with what you already have!",5,1750304741.0,HPV,1,1.0,False

I sometimes get suicidal thoughts when people do actually leave me.  it happened today 

when i have a deep dealing of rejection i get intense anger.  i often threaten to kill myself to people if I get mad enough.  I used to live with my family I would get the most intense mood shifts.  one time I started to feel upset that someone made a bad comment to me on reddit and I started screaming and yelling.  my family came in worried asking me what‚Äôs wrong and I started stabbing myself with things.  this stuff scares my family and my grandparents so when i was 18 i decided to move out because I couldn‚Äôt live with the guilt anymore.  i would constantly cut myself and show it to people to be like ‚Äúi hate you, this is what you did to me‚Äù.  I try to envoke a reaction out of others to get their sympathy if they make me upset.  so ill tell them im going to buy a gun and silly myself or be detailed in how I would harm myself 

i used to use drugs but stopped because it wasn‚Äôt helping me anymore.  nearly died one night by taking 5 halcions and 8 beers.  collapsed on the ground nearly cracking my head on the coffee table.  i got in trouble a year or two ago for beating up my moms.  so im a 19 year old dude and im a mess of a person .  This is me this is who i am.  I don‚Äôt enjoy living, i feel empty everyday.  I have had a long term feeling of loneliness.  Everyday I can‚Äôt predict how I feel.  Started to get suicidal today for a few hours.  Actually felt like I wanted to stop living .  after going through all the stress I have in my life I now just look at people as objects.

We‚Äôve been on two dates, and they‚Äôve been really great except for the fact that nothing has really advanced in a physical sense. Our first date we had coffee, for our second we played mini golf and got ice cream, both lasted around 2 and a half hours. 

I haven‚Äôt really dated since high school, so I‚Äôm still a bit all over the place figuring out how things work. I don‚Äôt usually do anything physical on the first date, but the second I‚Äôd at least want to try and go for a hug, preferably a kiss. I just didn‚Äôt really see any good signs to do so, I tried going for a hug at the start but honestly it was awkward and I don‚Äôt think she picked up what I was trying to do. The rest of the dates have been amazing, she genuinely seems like a great person, both times we talked nonstop until we left, and over text she‚Äôs been responsive and initiative. 

After the second date we both said we had a good time and wanted to see each other again, when I got back home I texted her saying I was enjoying getting to know her and that I haven‚Äôt really put myself out there or went on dates in a while so I‚Äôm still figuring things out, I wanted her to know I am interested in a romantic sense even if I‚Äôve admittedly been a bit too anxious about it. She responded saying she appreciated the transparency, she was enjoying getting to know me as well, and that she thinks it‚Äôs important to talk about that kind of stuff. 

I‚Äôm thinking for the next date I‚Äôm gonna invite her to my place, she previously suggested we could watch this movie together so it‚Äôs not out of the blue and would allow us to be a bit closer and intimate. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a case of us both being a bit nervous, she may also have different expectations about how she approaches dating, I think for now she‚Äôs still interested but if I don‚Äôt advance things by the next date she‚Äôs going to lose that interest or if she doesn‚Äôt reciprocate it she‚Äôs probably not as interested as I‚Äôd like.

I am 20 years old (soon 21) and I am still a virgin, without a partner, without kisses, without anything that seems so natural to everyone. But that's not what weighs me most. What bothers me is having really tried... and that every time it ends the same: in nothing.

But hey, I followed their advice to lose my fear and after chatting, try to ask them out.

The thing was like this:

+ I invited a girl from university (a classmate who I thought was pretty) several times. I got nervous, I sent him the message... and nothing.

+ I invited another classmate with whom I had studied a few months ago and we were texting, I cheered up despite the fear... she ghosted me directly.

+ I invited another girl who left university but I kept in touch, it even seemed like there was good vibes. She ended up inviting me first, but it was in the absolute friend zone.

+ I invited someone I met on Instagram, she chats well, she's cool, I invite her... ghosting again.

I invited the last one, I met this one 1 week ago, with whom I chatted very well, we even managed to get her Instagram. I invite her to a coffee‚Ä¶ I ghost the same.

And yes, clearly the pattern repeats itself. I'm not crying because of rejection. I am sharing the frustration of having tried it many times, and that the result is always the same: silence, emptiness, ‚Äúnothing happened.‚Äù
The craziest thing is that I speak well, with respect, without strange intensity. And it's not that I stayed in theory: I took the step. And still, nothing.

Maybe someone tells me: ‚Äúwait, it's coming‚Äù,
but the bottom line is that it's tiring. Because you want to see even a small result after trying so much.

That. I wanted to share it because I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

I went about 5 days without caffeine 2 months ago and I felt so clear-headed, but I still hadn't been working on my depression.

Lately I've been feeling really great with my new medications and supplements. I think I'm finally ready to quit caffeine. I'm very into holistic and green psychiatry + medicine and I believe that the general consensus among those communities is that at least for some people, it should be considered that it might be a good idea to eliminate caffeine completely from the diet.

I go through several different moods and sets of feelings in the same day. I believe that the fluctuating moods could be caused by the caffeine. As I've been increasing my meds + supplements I've been noticing the caffeine is less and less vital to my daily routine, and now I'm thinking maybe I'm finally ready to ditch it.

I'm going to record several clips of aspects of my daily medications/substances/supplements/food+drink, routine, tomorrow. I'm hoping that in doing this I can give myself the motivation to remember that I have the other tools and coping skills to get through my day without caffeine. It's been affecting me for so long and i KNOW it isn't healthy.

I think I've got the motivation to do this. I just have to be on the lookout - no iced tea (except green tea extract [supplement] with negligible amounts], no coffee, no mountain dew, no chocolate (except cocoa powder supplements with negligible amounts), no supplements with caffeine, no otherwise caffeinated soda.

I lit a cigarette, third one this hour, and leaned against the hood of my unmarked ‚Äò98 Crown Vic. The summer sun beat down like a punishment, making everything‚Äîgarbage, pavement, breath‚Äîsmell like hot meat. New York in July. Like hell forgot to pay the A/C bill.

They called me Frankie D‚ÄôAngelo. 26 years in Homicide. I‚Äôve seen bodies left in dumpsters, bathtubs, park swings, even once folded into a goddamn washing machine. But nothing‚Äînothing‚Äîlike this bastard.

They called him The Smiler.

At first, the papers tried cute nicknames. The Happy Slasher. Mr. Grin. I didn‚Äôt laugh. You don‚Äôt laugh when you find a woman on a subway bench with her lips sewn into a grotesque goddamn smile, a chunk of her tongue placed in her own lap like a garnish.

Three bodies. Three weeks. Always posed. Always smiling.

We didn‚Äôt know if it was thread or wire he used. Didn‚Äôt matter. It held. He made sure it held.

July 14th. 104 degrees in Queens.
Another body. This time a street magician named Rico. They found him inside a run-down magic shop, slumped against a wall of dusty top hats. His mouth sewn just like the others. Smile like a jack-o‚Äô-lantern. Eyes wide with terror. Only difference? The Smiler left us a message. Carved right into Rico‚Äôs chest.

‚ÄúYou see the world how it is. I show them what it can be.‚Äù

I stared at the words until they burned into my brain. Then I walked outside and puked into a trash can. My captain‚ÄîBurtino, a real asshole with a hairpiece you could land a plane on‚Äîtold me I was too close. Said I needed rest. I told him I‚Äôd rest when The Smiler was six feet under with a smile of his own.

He didn‚Äôt like that. Wrote me up. Again.

July 20th. 108 degrees in the Bronx.
Sweat poured down my spine like molasses. My suit clung to me like regret. We got a lead. Guy named Ellis. Homeless, lives under the BQE. Says he saw a man dragging a body bag into an abandoned factory near Hunts Point.

I found Ellis sitting under a bridge, shirtless, eyes cracked like desert stone.

""You Ellis?"" I asked.

He nodded, real slow. Like the heat cooked his thoughts.

""You said you saw something.""

‚ÄúI seen him, man,‚Äù he said, voice raspy like gravel. ‚ÄúHe hums. Real soft. Like a lullaby. Had a needle in one hand. Big smile on his face. Like he was proud.‚Äù

I knelt down, looked Ellis in the eye. ""What song was it?""

He thought. Then he hummed a few bars.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre happy and you know it‚Ä¶‚Äù

My blood turned to ice in the inferno. I knew that tune. My daughter used to hum it. Before the cancer. Before I buried her.

I stood, lit another cigarette, and told Ellis to stick close. Gave him twenty bucks. He cried. First time anyone paid him to remember a nightmare.


---

July 23rd. 110 degrees. No wind. No clouds. Just pain.
I broke into the factory at dawn. Didn't wait for backup. Couldn't. I had this fire in my gut, and it wasn‚Äôt just the bourbon from last night. I knew he was in there.

The place stank of rust, piss, and something else. Something sweet. Like rotting fruit.

Then I heard it.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre happy and you know it‚Ä¶‚Äù

Soft. Echoing off the broken walls. I followed it through the shadows, gun drawn, heart banging like a war drum.

That‚Äôs when I saw him.

He was crouched over something. No, someone. A young man. Hispanic. Still breathing. Barely. The killer was threading a needle with surgical precision, humming like a goddamn bedtime story.

I raised my gun.

‚ÄúFreeze!‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move. Just kept sewing. Slow. Deliberate.

‚ÄúI said freeze, motherf‚Äî!‚Äù

He finally looked up.

And Jesus Christ.

He wasn‚Äôt what I expected. No monster. No beast. Just a guy. Late 30s. Clean-shaven. Handsome, even. Like the type you‚Äôd hire to babysit your kids or host a game show. His eyes were the dead giveaway. Wide. Empty. Like TV static.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre interrupting my art,‚Äù he said.

His voice? Calm. Teacher-like. Polite.

I moved closer. ""Let him go.""

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù he said, rising slowly. ‚ÄúI free them. I give them what the world won‚Äôt. A smile. Forever.‚Äù

I felt something in me snap. Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was years of seeing the worst of humanity. Or maybe it was because this man was trying to give the world the same smile my daughter had‚Ä¶ before the chemo took it from her.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick,‚Äù I said, stepping forward.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm necessary.‚Äù

He lunged. I fired.

Bang.

One shot to the gut. He stumbled, but kept coming.

Bang. Bang.

Chest. Shoulder.

He dropped the needle. Still smiling. Still humming.

Bang.

Right between the eyes.

He collapsed like a marionette with its strings cut.

Blood pooled around his head in a thick, black halo. His face twisted in something that almost‚Äîalmost‚Äîlooked like peace.

July 24th. 102 degrees. Brooklyn.
The papers screamed about the hero cop who stopped The Smiler. They used my name like it meant something.

Frankie D‚ÄôAngelo.

But I didn‚Äôt feel like a hero. I felt like a man who stared into the void and flinched.

I visited the boy we saved. His name was Marco. He couldn‚Äôt talk, not yet. But when I walked in, he looked at me with eyes full of thanks and terror. And he tried to smile. Not sewn. Not forced.

Real.

I smiled back. Best I could.

As I walked out of the hospital, the heat hit me like a punch.

But for the first time in a long time‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt feel so heavy.

Foot traffic is low, but there are no options of this nature in walking distance in this area.

Here‚Äôs some specifics:

- The location I‚Äôm considering is a small strip of 4-5 storefronts. There is a convenience shop, and a restaurant that appears to have replaced another restaurant fairly recently. The food is great (went recently). The other storefronts are all shuttered businesses.

- The surrounding half mile radius is residential, which is then surrounded by two large middle schools, a large retail/chain shopping area with a big grocery store, and quite a few large commercial spaces (think mechanics, warehouses, etc). There‚Äôs also low income housing. There‚Äôs a Dunkin‚Äô Donuts/starbucks/panera nearby; not walking distance, but close.

- I would consider this neighborhood very prone to gentrification (saying this as someone who grew up one town over). I think it‚Äôs going to change substantially over the next 5-15 years.

- This is not a heavy foot trafficked area. It has some foot traffic due to the schools and transit nearby. But not a main square type of area.


I‚Äôd love to hear from people who run cafes, smoothie/juice bars, coffee shops etc what you think of an idea like this. I would focus on marketing to the immediate neighborhood with physical menus and coupons, build a good relationship with the restaurant next door (encourage folks to eat there/they encourage folks to get a drink from us), maybe even offer small business owner discounts since there‚Äôs a ton of different small business nearby. It‚Äôs a working class and heavily immigrant neighborhood is why I am focused on smoothies and juices. I don‚Äôt want to bring a hipster vibe at all to this area, especially as a local; more of a healthy, no frills, value focused option for my community.

Something to note too is it‚Äôs in a bit of a dead zone considering how many chains and businesses are only less than a mile or so away. There‚Äôs only like 2 restaurants that are walkable to the neighborhood,  and no local drink spots at all as far as I can tell (not even coffee).

Just not sure if the challenging criteria could make it difficult to be successful. Thank you for reading.",1,1750301674.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

Just to clarify upfront: I‚Äôm not technically an ex-Mormon, since I was never baptized and don‚Äôt plan to be anymore. But I got pretty close. This is the only place I can think of for advice anyways too.

My best friend has been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints her whole life. When she moved here, she was kinda shy and I asked her to be my friend ykyk. We got close in school and I invited her over to my house, she came over and we had some coffee, I remember her saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have that‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs that?‚Äù And then explained that she was Mormon, I thought that sounded cool and didn‚Äôt think anything n else of it for a while but then I got invited to a stake dance, and I really enjoyed it. Then I started going with her to the Wednesday night Young Women‚Äôs activities, mostly as a way to spend more time with her and learn more about her faith since I was kinda clueless. At first, it was just for fun, but I gradually got more curious and started paying attention to what they were teaching in the mini lessons. I eventually asked if I could go to their Sunday ‚Äúsacrament‚Äù service, and I was surprised by how interested I was in the talks and lessons, but obviously I couldn‚Äôt take the sacrament but I was silently hoping I could one day. It felt like something I‚Äôd never had, and they told me it was then ‚Äùspirit‚Äù I believed them and I came back the next week and my friend gave me a copy of the Book of Mormon, and they told me to start reading and then pray about if it was true. I started reading it, but I didn‚Äôt really understand what I was reading and I didn‚Äôt get the feeling from the sacrament, I prayed anyways and got that feeling again like the first ‚Äúsacrament‚Äù meeting so I believed it was true. That‚Äôs how they set me up with the missionaries, they had all of their lessons and I was really invested. They got to their lesson about baptism and they were trying to persuade me to get baptized as they apparently always do and I was really excited and wanted to so bad but told them I‚Äôd need to talk with my family. I did, and they said blankly ‚Äúno‚Äù and I told the missionaries that but they told me that my parents need to pray harder and they are stopping me from my faith or something like that. I kept going for a while but then I just stopped because of some family issues that conflicted with Sunday‚Äôs meetings, I get at least five messages a week asking when I‚Äôll come back and if my parents will agree for me to become a member and how my friend misses me!! and I also learned a lot about them and that‚Äôs even more why I am fed up with it! I still really want to be friends with them but the missionaries always use her a guilt trip and I think she‚Äôs okay with I don‚Äôt even know!! What do I do??

1lezq7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1lezq7k/i_wrote_a_poem_once/,I wrote a poem once,"Okay yeah I'm back tonight I guess, because I'm just gonna crank this one out and then go to bed, at a *gasp* decent time for once. 

This is actually just for me. It popped into my head and I have this thing where I don't really give myself time to think, and maybe if I keep setting aside a little time for that, it'll be easier to sleep at night without 900 things popping into my head. 

Anyway if you're still here, you might've read that title and thought to yourself, *Well of course you did. That's something you like to do.* oh, and keep in mind sometimes when I write here I don't know who I'm writing to-- am I writing to you, or to myself? I can't always figure it out, and I am guilty of referring to myself from third person. But never in front of other people, obviously. There you go hahaha, now you have another one of my biggest secrets.

But hear me out because I actually have a very specific poem in mind, one that I came up with around three years ago. It was supposed to go in my sketchbook with a cool drawing. I have a drawing for it, but it's not good enough and I really wanna redo it. 

Anyway it's pretty short and I've memorized it. I'm gonna admit that I still don't always understand the difference between poetry and prose (I'm pretty sure I've got it figured out, but I'm also stubborn and tend to be resistant to things.) 

Anyway I don't know why that's relevant, because I'm near positive this would count as a poem: 

At last, Spring has come.
and as the flowers bloom,
vines twisting and turning
through the cracks and crevices
of my heart
Suddenly I bleed color.

Wooo I don't know if the formatting will look right. Oh well. Anyway yeah, the meaning's kinda layered. There is some trauma and silliness in there, but it's also just kinda about getting better, I guess. It stinks, but I guess things always get worse before they get better. Not that things are bad now, lmao I'm pretty sure we're passed that. 

So like, this popped into my head when I think about yesterday. I decided to walk home from the gym. Even though I always talk about how close I am I've never actually taken the time to walk instead of taking a bus or getting a ride.  It'll take some getting used to, but I'd like to do it more often. 

I don't know. The world feels so big,  and in comparison I still feel so small. And vulnerable, too, sometimes, I guess. But the colors are so vibrant, and it's crazy how many things I've never really paid attention to, like the Thai restaurant on the corner, or that coffee place that I'm just *dying* to try. Ooo I wonder if the Thai place has beef salad. I think it was back when I took 311, I was buying that stuff nearly everyday. I was so mad when that spot got closed. 

Hmm in other news, my brother got a cat. A kitten, actually. So tiny, only five weeks old. Probably not a wise decision,  since we have three dogs. Also caused a huge fight in the family. The kitty is confined to his room. He's such a smart, cute, and intelligent baby. I think you would appreciate his name. Dewey.

Okay, that's just his nickname. Dyl actually insisted on giving him a much longer, more elaborate,  weird name. I don't even know how to spell it. And according to him, I'm horrible at pronouncing it too. It's five names total. Super excessive. I should tell him that he needs to add sir to the beginning. 

Okay me sleep now, byeeeeee

1lezpke,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1lezpke/my_first_divine_liturgy_experience_was_awful/,My First Divine Liturgy Experience was Awful,"A few weeks ago I (22F) attended my first Divine Liturgy in a Greek Orthodox Church. I felt like I had to at least try it if I want to be saved.

I wasn't really excited. I felt sick and worried for some reason. I don't have any ill will towards Orthodoxy at all. In fact, I respect it deeply and I'm always eager to learn about church history because of Orthodoxy.

I attended alone and sat in the back. I was one of the only non-Greeks in the service. I was surrounded by families and couples while I was the only one alone. I barely understood a word that was being said. It was a mix of Greek and English, but I struggled to understand what the priest was saying. It wasn't his fault, I think I was just too far in the back.

I stayed for the whole service. I stood and sat when everyone else did. I crossed when everyone else did. I prayed when everyone else did. I didn't partake in the Eucharist. I really wanted to though. I want to experience being in communion with Jesus Christ.

I didn't feel anything special during the chants. The icons were terrifying. I struggled to keep up with doing the cross signs with everyone else. I was constantly confused and felt so out of place. I didn't feel like I belonged there. I tried to connect with God. 

I left after the service. There was a coffee hour or something but there were just a bunch of families huddled together. There wasn't a place for me, so I didn't stay.

I tried to enjoy it. I just couldn't. It wasn't the Church's fault at all. Nothing resonated with me. I feel awful for feeling this way. It makes me feel like I'm extremely evil or something. I'm burdened with guilt for having these feelings towards the service. I keep wondering if I've been rejected by God. I don't want to reject Him either. I want to love Him and be saved.

I keep reading everyone else's first experience and all of their testimonies are the polar opposite of mine. They talk about how they felt God right away and how it was so beautiful to them. It makes me feel even worse, like I'm the devil or something.

This didn't only happen in the Orthodox Church. It happened this past Easter at a Catholic Church too. My Catholic friend invited me to attend the Easter service and it was the first time I've been to a Catholic service. I felt the exact same way as I described before.

I'm only sharing this because I want to know if this is normal. If anyone has experienced the same thing, I'd love for you to share it with me.

I'll keep praying for God to correct me and give me a heart of flesh. I desperately want to be saved and I know I cannot be saved if I'm not connected to the Church.",18,1750300500.0,OrthodoxChristianity,57,0.91,False

Just a pinch of baking soda (less than 1/16 tsp) for every cup can mellow out the sharp/tangy edge of black coffee without having to add milk or sugar. Be careful not to add too much to significantly affect its flavor. You only need just enough to neutralize its acidity. It does make the coffee slightly more bitter, but I actually enjoy that.

Also note that baking soda can absorb the odors of other compounds which might affect the added flavor on your coffee. You need to store it in an odorless airtight container or deliberately store it with an aromatic substance like vanilla or jasmine (I haven't tried this yet. I'm not sure if it will significantly affect the flavor).",2,1750299941.0,sugarfree,3,1.0,False
