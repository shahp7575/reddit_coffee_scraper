Breakfast 1: bougie granola to add to the stash for my celiac friend who may be visiting sometime in a week or two
Lunch 1: egg sandwiches and peach crumble
Dinner 1: ""cottage pie"" and mixed vegetables

Breakfast 2: porridge and honey
Lunch 2: idk, but I did get a coffee and the barista stuck stickers on my lid, and that made me smile a little.
Dinner 2: cursed little sandwiches that sat there and watched me sleep

Breakfast 3: okay we get it OP, the granola is fancy and you're being savvy, hush hush.
Lunch 3: Fish that smelt so bad, mixed vegetables, and rice pudding.
Dinner 3: pumpkin soup, egg sandwiches, and nippys 

No matter how awful I feel, I'll always try and write a thank you note and draw a little something. I'm too committed now. I could be curled up in pain but still cranking out those silly little pictures. 

The last slide is currently where I am now. I had a moment of energy at 11am and decided to go and get a coffee, but felt so awful pretty soon after, so it is now 7pm, and I've only just had the energy to have it, so I'm not against microwaving coffee. Microwaved cafe coffee is better than instant.

Some days, rice, meats veggies and fruits leave me wanting for pizza, even though it satiates me until my next meal, and a small snack, usually a pickle or two, or i weigh out some sunflower kernels.

1q3ka65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3ka65,Rokko Traverse - my first ultra distance on trail,"This wasn’t technically a *race*. That said, there are organised races that use this route several times a year. More importantly, my training plan labeled the day “race,” so I planned it like one, stressed about it like one, and suffered through it like one.

The Rokko Traverse (六甲縦走) is a long trail crossing the Rokko mountain range in Kobe. There are multiple route variations, but most versions run roughly east–west from Sumaura Park to Takarazuka, covering close to 50 km with around 3,300 metres (10,000 feet) of climbing. It’s not one big climb: it’s a cruel sequence of steep ups and downs that slowly sandpaper your legs into dust.

**Logistics: The First Challenge (before any running)**

The first real problem wasn’t pacing or fueling — it was what to do with my clothes.

It’s damn cold out this season, and the idea of finishing a long mountain run and then riding trains and a bike home in sweaty gear sounded miserable. Carrying extra clothes the whole way also sounded miserable, just in a different way. So two days before the run, I took the train out to Takarazuka, and stashed a jacket, shoes, and clean clothes there in a coin locker. Future Me would either thank me or curse me depending on whether I actually made it that far.

**Race Morning (even though it wasn’t a race)**

Alarm at 3:20 a.m. Breakfast. Running clothes. Bike to the nearest JR station in the dark, wondering why I do this voluntarily. I was absolutely freezing, but a station coffee and a warm train helped.

I took the first train to Akashi. In hindsight, starting directly at Sumaura Park would have been much more sensible. But I wanted to see the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge at twilight, so I decided to add a 12 km “warm-up” before the actual trail. Sensible is overrated.

The train was full of people heading home after Friday all-nighters. I tried not to stare at my phone too much and instead mentally rehearsed the day. I was carrying 3 gels, 4 rice balls, 1 litre of water, and a few items that turned out to be essential later: band-aids, a phone charger, and a headlamp (we’ll come back to that).

The warm-up went smoothly, bridge was beautiful, and I hit the start of the trail around 7:45 a.m. That’s when the real adventure began.

**Early Miles: Reality Check**

The trail starts climbing immediately. Steeply. And it became obvious very quickly that I was still carrying fatigue from the previous week. Even the first climb felt hard.

This is kind of the Rokko Traverse’s signature move: you don’t climb 3,300m all at once. Instead, you climb 300m, descend 300m, hit pavement for a few minutes, then repeat. Sometimes it’s rocky, sometimes wooded, and sometimes–if you’re lucky–it’s just straight stairs.

The early section up to Takatori is basically the appetiser. It hurts, but it’s manageable. After that, you’re officially seated for the main course.

**Mount Maya: The Main Course**

The climb up Mount Maya is brutal. About 700 metres of gain, and by now the legs are already pretty cooked.

By the time I reached the top, it was after 2 p.m. I had one rice ball and one gel left and was about two hours behind schedule. I’d been dreaming (borderline fantasising) about a bowl of udon at a shop I knew near the top.

It was closed.

Luckily, there were a couple of food stands still open. I grabbed a karaage dog (fried chicken in a bun), sat down for 5-10 minutes, enjoyed the view, and let the grease work its magic. Around here, I noticed snow on the ground for the first time. Fortunately, I’d packed two pairs of gloves. I doubled them up and got back on the road.

**Mount Rokko: “Dessert” Is a Lie**

In my head, Mount Rokko was dessert. Maya was the main dish, so surely the final peak would be… manageable?

Absolutely not.

The climb itself isn’t particularly steep, but by now I was 42+ km in, physically and mentally exhausted. Snow covered the trail, and then it started actively snowing. Honestly, that part felt more magical than difficult... I come from somewhere where it almost never snows.

This was also my first time navigating this section, which meant repeatedly thinking *“I must be almost there”* and being very, very wrong every time. I got lost a couple of times despite having the route on my watch… there are lots of forks where it’s not immediately obvious which way is correct.

Eventually, I reached the summit of Mount Rokko (930m). It was snowing hard. I’d hoped someone might take a photo of me, but there was no one around, so I settled for a selfie and started the descent.

**The Long Way Down (a.k.a. Why I Fear Descents)**

For me, descending is harder than climbing, and this final descent was the most brutal and mentally challenging section of the entire day. My ankle hurt, I had a couple of blisters (thank you, band-aids!), and my phone was down to 10% (thank you, charger!)

I kept hoping for road or easy trail. Instead, it was mostly rocky, woody singletrack, very few steps, and just enough snow to keep things interesting. The flatter snowy sections felt amazing… and then came more downhill.

A few kilometres before the summit, I’d passed another runner. We waved. On the way down, we met again and talked briefly. Turns out he was also doing the full traverse–and had previously run the Tahoe 200. I told him to go on ahead and said, *“I might catch up.”*

Spoiler alert: I did not catch up.

In fact, I didn't see a single other person from this point until I made it back into the city.

I stopped on a flat snowy section to eat my final rice ball, and around this time it started getting dark. The night before, almost as an afterthought, I’d stuffed a headlamp into my pack.

“I’m sure I won’t need this,” I’d said out loud. “But just in case.”

I needed it. For the last 30 minutes, the trail was pitch black. At one point, my headlamp caught two small eyes reflecting in the distance… flashing, disappearing, flashing again. *Please don’t be a bear or a boar,* I thought. Probably it was a cat. Maybe. Any animal in the dark is terrifying when you’re alone and exhausted.

**Finish Line (and a pigeon rival)**

After nearly 12 hours, 59 km, and 3,200 metres of climbing, I finally made it to Takarazuka.

First stop: Seven-Eleven sandwich and protein drink. I wanted nothing more than to sit down, but a very feisty pigeon tried to fight me for the sandwich, so I stood a bit longer.

Then: coin locker, clean clothes, and a freezing walk to the public bath (you don’t notice the cold while you’re running!) Inside, for the fourth time that day, I ran into my Tahoe-200 friend… already finished with his bath!

“So much for ‘I might catch up,’” I said.

We exchanged Strava details, and I finally got to sit in warm water, tired, sore, and incredibly satisfied. My first time running an ultra-distance on trail, and my first full Rokko Traverse in the books.",4,1767513695.0,Ultramarathon,0,1.0,False

I’ve seen many posts of people sharing about post-COVID migraines but none with triggers/trends of effective managements shared. I’m just wondering if there’s any common themes for those of us with these covid migraines??

IF you’re a post-covid sufferer I would LOVE to hear any of the following: 

1️⃣any common triggers?
2️⃣effective preventative treatments? 
3️⃣effective acute treatmwnts 

➡️treatments ineffective? 
➡️any diagnosis or suspicions? 

I’ve struggled SO hard to find a medical provider that actually has expertise and advocates for me. So yes. Here I am asking reddit. 

For me personally my answers would be: 
1) drinking alcohol makes them worse (sometimes), eating lots of protein/salts seems to reduce migraine frequency (but I’ve never had a huge appetite so I find this challenging), regularly drinking electrolytes and tons of water helps reduce frequency. 
2) propranolol was effective as a preventative but I kept needing dosage increases (up to 100mg 2x day), and I was getting wild nightmares and reduced effectiveness,  so was recently switched to Venlafaxine 75mg which has been completely ineffective after 8 weeks and causing crazy night sweats. 

3) Mint-Frovotriptan has been my most effective acute treatment, along with frozen coffees, chugging electrolytes and having a nap. Other failed acute treatments: Cambria did nothing, Advil and Tylenol do nothing, rizatriptan was partially effective but not as good as frovotriptan. Other suggestions that don’t work for me beyond a couple minutes include all the classics: ice on the head, peppermint oil, feet in hot water, craniosacral therapy, pressure points on my head, acupuncture … have been willing to try absolutely anything 🙃. 

I’ve seen mention of covid causing POTS or Dysautonomia so looking into those more, I suspect that I need more hydration and more electrolytes than the average person (I drink 3-4 litres of water a day, if I’m exercising I can be slightly more or with electrolytes added).

Before this I mainly brewed with an AeroPress and drank milk-based coffees, so switching to straight black V60 has been a big change for my palate.

I’m currently brewing very light roast coffees on a plastic V60 (01) with a Timemore C3 grinder, mostly using the Tetsu Kasuya 4:6 method. While my brews seem technically okay in terms of flow and total brew time, I’m struggling to consistently find sweetness, and I’m also not really able to taste the flavor notes mentioned on the coffee.

Most cups tend to lean either toward brightness or develop slight bitterness toward the finish, but without much clarity or sweetness in between.

Current setup:

	•	Coffee: 15 g

	•	Water: 240–250 g (1:16–1:16.6)

	•	Grinder: Timemore C3

	•	Grind size tested: 22–25 clicks

	•	Water temp: \~94–96°C

	•	Filter: Hario white papers

	•	Kettle: gooseneck

Example brew (4:6):

	•	0:00 – 40 g bloom

	•	0:40 – +60 g (100 g total)

	•	1:20 – +75 g (175 g total)

	•	2:00 – +75 g (250 g total)

	•	Total drawdown: \~3:00–3:10

I’m enjoying the learning process and trying to build a solid foundation, but my main goal right now is to start tasting the natural sweetness and flavor clarity people often talk about with light roasts.",1,1767513235.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

If she wasn’t such a pacifistic weakling, if she only followed Atlas’ advice and burned Pebble until they were a lifeless husk of coal, maybe things would’ve turned out differently.

Blowtorch knew that that her arm would regrow… hopefully, but it would take a while adjusting to her missing limb.

“Hey, Blowtorch! How have you been holding up?” Tree Topper greeted.

He looked happy to see another person from his team complete the challenge, but his smile became strained once he noticed she only had two arms on her left side.

“Blowtorch… I’m sorry for whatever happened to you out there… If Atlas wasn’t so inconsiderate to have you redo the challenge…”

Blowtorch narrowed her eyes into a glare.

“I WOULDN’T HAVE LOST IT! YOU DON’T…YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, SO DON’T ACT LIKE YOU DO!!“

Tree Topper reached out a hand to seemingly comfort her, but she slapped his hand away. She didn’t need his pity and fake kindness.

Blowtorch walked away from Tree Topper and sat cross-legged on the concrete ground, trying her best to ignore the stares and whispers directed at her from her fellow competitors.

“I can’t believe it! I… I stood up to him! I…didnt know I was even capable of something like that, even if I felt like… a completely different person doing it.“ she ruminated.

Blowtorch believed she was still a far cry from confident person who can stand on her own like Atlas can, but her argument with Tree Topper proved sticking by Atlas’ side is necessary to reach that milestone.

I am going to list the things that bother/worry me most and it may sound like I hate this man, but I truly don’t. I also rarely bring these things up with him, I would never want to make him feel bad, so please don’t take this rant like I am torturing the man.

He is an apprentice tradesman, but he has let his apprenticeship run overtime as he procrastinates things, like he is due to do one more stint in college before he qualifies and has been waiting months to hear word about same, but he won’t ring them up himself and he refuses to let me do it on his behalf. He goes out to the pub at least twice a week, which would be fine if he had any sense, but he always ends up out til 4am, sometimes heading to a derelict cottage owned by his family for ‘afters’ with his friends, in which case he’ll be out all night long. He prides himself on being the “leader” of his friend group which I find so childish, especially considering they are all mid-late 20s. He has developed an ‘addiction’ to vapes, won‘t stop, won’t even try, it’s a ridiculous habit in my opinion, he has a drawer full of them in his bedroom. He can’t organise his finances; I know apprentice wages are bad, but he is living with his parents and he still runs out of money and can’t pay small bills. He will let me pay for his coffee and then spend his last penny on a vape. His mam cleans his room and leaves little notes for him pleading with him to respect his room/keep it clean. I recently visited his parents for dinner and afterwards, he put his plate in the sink and went into the sitting room, feet up watching darts, I followed him in and asked him to come back into the kitchen to clean up (after his parents had spent hours making a beautiful dinner) and he threw a little strop getting up, (his parents wouldn’t let us clean up anyway - ?ROOT OF PROBLEM). I want to go for a walk every now and then and he’ll get pissed off bc he’d rather stay in on the couch. He didn’t even give me a Christmas card, let alone a gift for Christmas, I didn’t even mention it because I saw it coming. And this is all just recent stuff, like the list goes on and on and on.

Despite how all this sounds, I do love him but not as much as I used to. I feel more like a mother than a partner. He isn’t there for me the way I am for him. I just don’t think he is in a place in his life where he is ready for a relationship, let alone a family. I have tried so hard to help him get on his feet but he refuses to help himself.

As a result, I think I am going to end the relationship and emigrate. I don’t want to waste any more time and if settling down with a good man isn’t an option right now, I would like to emigrate for a while.",6,1767512766.0,WomenofIreland,8,0.88,False

So I have a Delonghi Dedica EC685 for almost 2 years now, and ever since I have been using it to do espresso. I had one incident where the taste was awfully sour when extracting. I had doubts over the water source and coffee, so I changed both. After descaling, the sourness was still there. So, I went to my vendor, and he cleaned it.

Now, the descaling indicator lit up again so I started the descaling program. Afterwards the sourness came back, I flushed the tank through the machine but the sourness is still there after refilling the tank 3 times now. What should I do? Should I go to the vendor again or is there another fix I can do? I cannot imagine that I need to flush out water from the tank 10 times for example.

 (June 30th, 1865, Southbound Ranch, Texas) “A man can give everything for his country, only to return from war with the hopes of being forgotten, and forgetting himself.” James wrote in his diary as he walked among the decaying corpses of the men he once fought beside, and the men he once saw as a threat only one month prior. Now they were just corpses on the ground. Peaceful, lying there, still. James walked through the field, the sounds of cannon fire still whooshing overhead in his mind, the smoke of gunpowder still blurring his vision, and burning his eyes, the screams of the war still haunting him. Suddenly he dropped to his knees, a plain stare on his face, he had stumbled upon whom he was looking for. A blue blood-stained coat lay torn, a face motionless, and decaying, once brown eyes now pale. (May 13th, 1865, Southbound Ranch, Texas) “Over the hill and through the vineyard men, c’mon keep pushing.” General Greysonshouted, as the tired men continued to push on-wards. The hot summer heat was taking its toll on the men but a soldier must obey orders. So James sluggishly marched on-wards with the rest of the men. (June 29th, 1865, Near Southbound Ranch, Texas) “The war had ended already but our Generals were too blood hungry to know it. Those men… My brother, they all died… for nothing.” He wrote as he sat up to make some coffee. “Now I must find him and bury him.” He wrote as he sipped his steaming coffee. (May 13th, 1865, Southbound Ranch, Texas) As the bullets flew by and men beside him dropped, James suddenly felt a sharp pain in his side, his once dirty gray wool jacket, now rapidly turning a dark red. He had been shot. As he pushed on-wards through the pain, suddenly his legs gave out, and he dropped. He was losing a lot of blood. But let off a few shots before everything turned black. (June 29th, 1865, Near Southbound Ranch, Texas) “I don’t remember much of what happened after being shot. I was out for bout an hour. And when I woke up I was in a field hospital and the wound had been cauterized.” James wrote as he recalled the events that happened that day. “When I returned home a week later, Ma had been informed that William didn’t make it.” He wrote in his journal. “Why couldn’t he have listened to me and joined the Confederacy, why did he have to die…” He wrote. (June 30th, 1865, Southbound Ranch, Texas) James buried his brother on what remained of the battlefield, and with his brother’s blue coat in hand he walked up the hill to where he’d remembered being shot. (June 19th, 1865, Somewhere in Texas) “News came today the war had been declared over. We’d lost… We’d all lost more than just the war.” James wrote in his journal. (April 20th, 1861, Somewhere in Texas) “Leave the Union brother and join me in fighting for our rights as a Confederate, I know you want the country to stay unified and you feel obligated to serve the Union, but they don’t respect our people’s livelihood. I just… I’d feel a lot better if you were fighting with me and not against me. Your brother - James.”( July 2nd, 1865, Somewhere in Texas) The letter he had written to William, but never received a response back on. William had kept it in his jacket after all this time. “I found the letter I’d written to him, along with a letter he’d planned to send me back. I didn’t have it in me to read it, but it’s in the sleeve in the back of my journal if you’d like to read it Ma. Your son - James” He wrote before leaving the blue coat and journal on his moms doorstep and walking away. (June 30th, 1865, Southbound, Texas) As he looked down the hill from where he had been shot he noticed where his brother had laid… He had been the one who shot William, He had been the one who took his brothers life that day, how could he forgive himself? How could Ma forgive him? (July 2nd, 1865, Somewhere in Texas) Jame’s mom had read his journal, but she would never know why her son never returned that day. She’d lost one son to the war, but the hard truth she would realize that day was both had been lost. And one day like James wrote, they’d both be forgotten.",2,1767512469.0,writers,1,1.0,False

We volunteered and I ended up moving in earlier than expected in late November while my fiancé moved in early December. We already established that our roommates have been having trouble with their schedules and have also had trouble managing cleanliness in the home it was very minor at the time and R and C started to maintain their hygiene when we moved in and even started to return to their original chores and time management duties. 

However, as more days passed it became noticeable that J had been not cleaning up after herself and making the home unlivable and unsafe; her room had food and trash that was rotting and causing a awful smell at the end of the hallway, there was her cats fecal matter on a piece of furniture, boxes and clothes were thrown about the room, the windows were consistently always open and she left her dishes on the coffee table in the living room which is where she sleeps mainly because her room is so bad. This has been going on since she moved into the apartment in feb/March of last year. We have brought it up to her and the first instance was when R and C went on a drive and the conflict involved her screaming at me and my fiancé and running off to her room and slamming her door putting me into a panic attack and mental breakdown for an hour and a half. My roommates know I suffer from traumatic incidents from family and old relationships so conflict is not one of my strong suits and this was the worst emotional experience I’ve had to endure since I lived with my parents in 2021. 

R is disabled and they need assistance with certain tasks and they have mentioned their need for a support animal since they don’t have a lot of people at home to keep them company as we all work and they tend to have seizures now and again from stress. B has a heart condition which could become a risk if her room and the environment are not clean, and C suffers from severe asthma. 

Since everyone had been doing a fair enough job to maintain the home and R needed an emotional support animal to keep them company, we agreed to look for some options. In December we found a dog that needed to be rehoused since she needed owners who were home 24/7 R was the perfect match. We made a plan for when the dog was moving in (Jan 9) and reminded J consistently to keep up with her chores and responsibilities and to please clean her room before she got here and mentioned the risks her room poses to the roommates. Ever since my fiancé moved in it has been excuse after excuse;

“I needed the old roommate to move out to move my belongings out of my room”

“I needed you to move in so I can move stuff”

“I need your fiancé to move in so I can move stuff”

“I’m too tired”

“I’ve been working all day”

“I just got home from work”

“I’ll do it in a little bit” (never happens)

“I didn’t want to do it during Christmas because we were busy celebrating”

It has gotten to a point where I find myself reminding her everyday to do SOMETHING about her room and it always seems to be getting put off or not taken seriously. My roommates and I went up to her today right before writing this and set the boundary that we will not be signing a lease with her if she does not clean and keep the bedroom maintained explaining it being a safety hazard to our roommates and the animals. She couldn’t come up with a response and angrily grabbed her comforter, told me to get out of her way, stomped and yelled down the hall to her room and slammed the door like a child.

What do we do. We have discussed owning our own house (hopefully) without her, but I feel bad ditching her at the same time. Is there a compromise we can try to make to keep everyone happy but following schedule and maintaining the home.

I purposely told myself New Years night that I will move on from my divorce by being angry in order to keep the sorrow and grief away. Today I woke up extremely angry! Spend the day in anger. Then in the evening while driving to meet a friend for coffee I was listening to a video from Better Beyond Divorce and the therapist said in order to let go you have to forgive.

She described how keeping resentment doesn't hurt anyone except yourself. It's like drinking poison and thinking the other person will die. I knew I will eventually have to move past the anger stage but I didn't want to even think about it now. As Rachel Sloan described why people keep resentment I asked myself why be angry and resentful and my answer wasn't that I was using it to keep grief away but my answer was that it is actually still keeping me connected to my ex wife. As if being angry at her will do something to her somehow. Anger was my little way of still holding to a marriage and partner that isn't there.

So I decided to forgive her, even if I believed she doesn't deserve it. Rachel Sloan said it doesn't matter that your partner knows if you forgive them or not. After meeting with my friend I went home, greeted my ex wife (we cohabiting for a few months) and told her I wanted to speak with her. I told her I forgive her, I didn't elaborate much but I told her - for me, not her- that I forgave her.

It felt good to say those words. It did feel l wasike forgiving her will free me from holding on.

I went back outside and I drove throughout the city I had a mix of emotions. I felt that I was letting go. Then as I drove and thinking I came back to angry. Then as I drove and memories ran through my head especially seeing places that we used to go to I felt immense sadness and grief. It has been a day of rollercoaster emotions, that's for sure.

Now I'm going to bed and still think I made the right decision to try to actively forgive her. I'm being kind to myself, it's okay to feel a mix of sadness, pain, hurt, disappointment , anger and resentment - it doesn't hurt the fact that I forgive her. I forgive her and I have to move on with my life without holding onto her. I won't let her hurt me anymore. I forgive you because I want to grow and build myself.

Still I must admit since the first day of our marital problems I haven't had one spare second that I haven't thought of her, our marriage and what's happening. She is in my head 24/7. She/us is my first thought when I wake up, my last thought before I sleep and when I wake up in the middle of the night 

Still I forgive her and I'm moving on with my life. Our marriage doesn't exist anymore, there's no us, no hope and I am proud.

2. It's alot to talk about and explain

3. The internet and society have already decided who was involved and responsible. My small voice wont reach very far and it's just not worth the effort.

September, 2011.


I'm 19, fresh out of dropping out of my first semester of community college because i realized how much i hated school and wasn't interested in doing math and english again.

I was angry and had a grudge against.... *something*. I wasn't sure. I just had this gut feeling and knew *something* was wrong with the world. But I was a dumb teenager who was unfamiliar with politics, economic issues and much more. i was just angry.


An activist friend of mine who I smoked with messaged me and asked me if I wanted to accompany him to this late night meeting of the 'general assembly"" in NYC. I didn't know what it was, but I enjoyed hanging out with him and I was mildly curious so I said sure.


So we go. We get there around 8pm. We're just outside of Central Park and it's dark out. My buddy and I find this group of about 5 older men standing near a statue talking. We go up introduce ourselves, etc. I didn't understand the significance then but looking back, I get it. 

The discussion was revolving around attendance, potential issues, long term effects of the protest and occupation of liberty park.


To be honest they were a bit confused about who we were and why we were there, but my friend mentioned that the meeting had been posted online. We just happened to be the only ones who showed up. So there we are, the 7 of us, discussing what would become a pivotal moment in american history. Of course I didn't understand the implications back then.


So cue a week later, here we are in bowling green park. I'm on the steps with people talking through the loudspeaker. Im there with the marches. I'm there when we settled into liberty park.


I start helping set up the media center, where I would spend most of my days. I watched the Nic-At-Night table form. The library, the dumpster diving before the pizza donations started flowing in. The constant 24/7 drum circles. The impromptu music sessions. The pictures, the spontaneous marches. 


The first few days were a fever dream. Celebrities stopped by. We got autographs. Immortal Technique showed up the 3rd night and did a show for anyone who was awake at 3am. We ran on coffee and that's about it. Cops were everywhere and the public was equal parts annoyed and infatuated, both telling us to get jobs and to keep going. Myself and a few others set up emails, twitter accounts, FB, etc. I set up the official twitter and much more. i handled much of the communication, answered questions from journalists, both on the computer on in person. I was interviewed multiple times.


Fast forward a week or two and I'm denying an interview with Stephen Colbert (on behalf of his interns) because i just finished an interview with a vietnamese newspaper and havent slept more than 7 hours in the last 3 days. Relaying police locations through social media, de-escalating the ever growing problem of SA, violence and unhygenic behavior that was going on in the park. Yes, there were some really shitty, awful things that happened during the occupation. Don't let anyone tell you different. 


When i needed a shower, i spent a few hours traveling home to eat, shower and go back. Or I would shower in the apartments of people I met. Food was readily available any time of the day at this point. Especially pizza. A few pizzerias had created their own pizza specifically for us. The 'Occu-pie'. lol.


I made life long friends and memories. I got arrested a few times and put on YT. (still there). I watched men in suits go in and out of telecom company trucks and had my phone hacked multiple times. I had my retinas scanned, was beaten by NYC cops and passed out from blood circulation being cutoff because our zipties were too tight. I met some of the greatest men and women I've ever known in jail cells. The kind who stole food from the cops and passed them too us as they were being escorted to the cells next to us. I shared hand rolled cigarettes with hardened criminals who happened to be in the same cell as we were because we snuck them in and they knew where matches were hidden. I've had friends I just met waiting outside with food and coffee for us when we got released. I've had a few short and long term romantic encounters as a result of being there, and I've had my mind opened via natural and man-made substances in apartments i would normally only ever dream of standing on the balcony of, overlooking the city.


now it's fair to say that many might disagree about many thing about OWS. and that's ok. my political views arent the same either. I've grown and it's been a long time.


Whether it was karma, synchronicity or just sheer dumb luck, I got to be a part of something that, not only am I immensely proud of and look back on with fondness, gratitude and love, but something I consider to be pivotal in american history. and I wouldnt change anything.

1q3jmw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1q3jmw8/should_i_show_up_to_my_dad_after_15_years_of_no/,Should I show up to my dad after 15 years of no contact?,"Long post, Back story: So around 2011 my parents got divorced. I was 12 at that time. One day, my dad furiously just left the house and never came back. I lived with my mom ever since then. He also cut us off financially and took no responsibility. He basically abandoned us and ceased all communication, hired bunch of lawyers to seize cars/property and other things we had access to. We are from a country where men usually have all the power and women don’t, so after divorce my mom did not get anything from my dad. Soon enough my mom was struggling to pay mortgage, my school tuition fees and other living costs with her job over there. She had some assets back home, so she liquidated everything and decided to apply to the USA in an investment category for a better future for me. Our paperwork was approved 3 years later for a legal stay. 

We moved to the United States around 2015 and became US citizens in 2018. I started high school, went to college, graduated super early, pursued my MBA and currently I am working at Apple as a Senior Software Engineer. My mom worked a few odd jobs throughout the years and I worked odd jobs through hs / college. I am 26 now, My mom dosent work anymore, I asked her to stay home, I make around $300k a year so I just take care of us.

Recently I was curious how my dad was doing. We haven’t been in touch since the day he left in 2011. I tried reaching out couple of times throughtout the years and he never replied back. He remarried twice since 2011, currently he is with his 3rd wife. I looked him up on Facebook in December end and to my surprise I found a few pictures he uploaded. He was headed to USA for 2 weeks to celebrate new years. He is currently in the same town as me for atleast one more week.

I was curious to find out where he is living, so I checked his facebook profile everyday for new posts. He is an avid poster, and he posted everyday. I saw a video of him having tea in a shop. I couldn’t catch the name but it looked like a chamomile tea. I screen recorded the video, and I asked ChatGPT, “find me coffee shops that serve chamomile tea in this town.” Long behold, 16 results popped up. To narrow the search more I asked ChatGPT to narrow the search down to shops that have opening hours at 6:30 AM because he posted the video around that time. It narrowed it down to 7 shops. I personally went down to all those 7 shops to get a cupcake or something till I found the exact spot he came to based on the furniture and layout of the shop in the video. 

Great, I found the coffee shop he went to one morning. He probably lives closeby within 5-10 blocks in an Airbnb or something. I drove around the neighborhood a bit but gave up because there was 100s of houses lol. 

The very next day, he posted a selfie of him infront of a house with home clothes on and there was a car parked in the street in the back. I saw that and told myself, The car has a plate. Hmm.

I went to the DMV system to “pay tickets” and check ticket history for that plate number, and I found out that this car received multiple tickets in the past 2 years in the same street. The owner probably lives in that street and forgot to move his car at times. Surprisingly, the coffee shop I sourced, is also 7 blocks away from the street. I asked ChatGPT to find me coffee shops that are in walking distance to the previous list of coffee shop from the same street that opens at 6:30 AM, and it gave me the same result I sourced. 

Great, now I know which street my dad is on. That street only has 6 houses. My dad is living in that street, in 1 out of the 6 houses. I figured, tomorrow, I will drive to that street, park a bit far away and sit in my car, watch movies till I see him coming out, and approach him. Eventually he will come out lol, he is a tourist in this town.

I have no bad intentions, I just wanted to speak to him, see how he was doing and ask if he would be willing to have dinner with me one day. If you were in his shoes, how would you react, would it be negative or positive? Should I just let it go, or go ahead with this. I haven’t been in touch or seen him in 15 years.

Since that point it has been an incredible 3 week rollercoaster as the community got around CrossPoint.

I am so blown away by this community's positivity and support around CrossPoint, and I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all.

Since launching it, CrossPoint has gained 400 stars on GitHub, had 17 different people contribute code (not counting all the pending changes), had an incredible number of people offering suggestions and support, and had all of you posting about your love for it with your current setups. I've seen it in the background of posts loving the X4, direct appreciation posts, featured in videos, and an ever-flowing stream of comments mentioning it. It's incredible.

This all started with a few pioneers in the Discord, huge shoutouts to u/JetSerge, u/CidVonHighwind, and everyone else in that community who initially started with a small idea that custom firmware *may* be possible, and the early work done to get some POCs off the ground.

To those who have contributed code, I appreciate the effort working in and around my mostly unpolished code, and the patience of dealing with my reviews. Y'all have added some amazing features which I would not have had the time/energy to complete, so on behalf of everyone enjoying the fruits of your labor, thank you!

To those who donated some of their hard-earned dollars (especially in this economic climate) to CrossPoint, I can't say how appreciative I am. It's such an amazing symbol of your support and rest assured all proceeds will be going towards snacks and coffee to help keep me fueled up.

(I wanted to take a beat here to reaffirm that CrossPoint is, and will always be, free. I do not rely on tips/donations to sustain myself or the ongoing development of the firmware, regardless of how appreciated they are.)

To everyone using CrossPoint, thank you, I hope you're enjoying your respective books and my work can make your reading experience just a little bit better ❤️

Thank you all for making this community awesome, and please check out the other work by the community, things like: [MicroReader](https://github.com/CidVonHighwind/microreader), [cr2xt](https://github.com/CrazyCoder/cr2xt), [x4converter](https://x4converter.rho.sh/), [hojo](https://github.com/meta-boy/hojo), [ReadMe.club](https://www.readme.club/), and likely many more which I've missed!

\---

A note on the work coming soon:

The remaining things to tick off for a [1.0 release](https://github.com/daveallie/crosspoint-reader/discussions/186) are hyphenation support, and more stability of the update functionality, and network transfer functionality. You may see a handful of other major features between now as then as the community have been cooking up some big ones in the last week or so, but they aren't requirements for what I consider 1.0.

The biggest piece to follow 1.0 is true custom fonts, I have yet to properly spike it, but have some rough ideas on an approach. Until the point where custom fonts exist, support for other specific languages will likely go unaddressed (sorry to the Vietnamese/Japanese/Chinese/Korean readers out there, I know you have been asking for support for a bit). Until then, it's worth having a look at some interesting forks like [this one](https://github.com/eunchurn/crosspoint-reader-ko) which replaces all fonts with Korean support.

Even though it is currently pre-1.0 (literally just an arbitrary line in the sand), if you've been on the fence, I'd encourage you to give it a go, the reading experience has been solid for a while, and from the volume of people I've seen using it, it doesn't seem to explode people's devices or anything.

To date, I have been trying to make CrossPoint reflect the community's wishes but also be something I want to continue to use myself. Managing inbound requests and PR has taken up more of my time than I initially anticipated and I am just a single human with a life and a full time job. So while I do appreciate all the support CrossPoint gets, please forgive me if I'm not able to get to everything in a timely manner and if things start to slow down a little on the development-front as the year starts to ramp back up.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but my dream for CrossPoint is that it becomes obsolete. I have enjoyed developing within the constraints of this device, but would also love for everything great about CrossPoint to be copied into the official firmware. Having options for firmware is nice, but I don't want people to chose between feature X in CrossPoint and feature Y in the OFW. I'm just a dude in front of a keyboard who picked up the device, whereas Xteink can properly support something well into the future and roll it out across other devices in their range.

That is all for now folks, and thank you all once again.",66,1767511146.0,xteinkereader,3,1.0,False
1q3jj2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1q3jj2q/my_experience_worldbuilding_for_people_beginning/,My Experience Worldbuilding. (For People Beginning Worldbuilding (Especially if through Dungeons and Dragons and/or With Other People)),"It's a little long, but here is my experience and advice coming from someone who has been doing this for roughly 5 years total, and has a lore manual of everything that extends 455 pages and counting, because no world is ever done. This is my first post on Reddit, and I just thought I would share to see if it helps anyone.

Overview:

Ultimately, when you look at worldbuilding as a whole, at least in my experience, it's just shoving whatever sounds awesome together while binding it to some semblance of reality and seeing yourself live in this world with all these things and being mystified. That’s \*my\* goal at least. If I could step into my world, I want to be awash in the splendor of beauty, complexity, characters, depth, and lore, nothing like what our Earth has to offer. Below is my experience building 5ish years and 455 pages worth of lore and worldbuilding step by step in what is, I believe is the most fun and easiest way to create stories and fantasy (or realistic) worlds. I broke it into chapters for fun, but each chapter is super short.

Chapter 1: Thunder Legends

When my brother and my brother were little, we had a trampoline, and we would often do fake, superhero-style fights. I believe it began with Pokémon battles where we would imagine ourselves as the Pokémon doing the attacks to each other (nonviolently). Eventually, this evolved into, “We need more characters to fight each other.” So we created characters, maybe it was a knight who was possessed by a ghost, or a digital block character, or a living rock person; the sky was the limit. So we created these fighters who all had very specialized attacks and whatnot, and we battled each other on the trampoline. And our imaginations ran vividly wild. We would introduce our fighters to each other with their backstories, making a bunch of mini-stories. At some point, we wanted not to fight, but instead pretend we \*were\* these characters; thus, the medium of the fictional narrative was introduced to our lives. We created an evil character, King Crusher. He had captured all of our heroes, and we had to trek as one character of our choosing through uncharted territory to rescue them. I suppose it was right before this that I was introduced to Dungeons and Dragons. I, as a Game Master of sorts, led trampoline adventures for my brother, and then we would switch roles. There was no world, there was no magic system or lore other than what our characters already had, which, again, was just their backstory lore.  
  
At this time, we had just finished playing Undertale and Deltarune (Chapters 1 and 2), and I don’t know if we liked the characters, or the villains, the setup of the story, or what, but it convinced us to broaden our stories. \\\[A few years prior, before the trampoline battles, we had a comic book “agency.” We never published anything, but we called it Thunder Comics. Why that name? No idea.\\\] Anyway, after we were inspired by video games, shows, our own comics, the games my brother made on Scratch, etc., we created a grand narrative; we called it Thunder Legends. This was the first time all of our adventurers and superheroes, and our previous villains, would work together to defeat King Crusher once and for all. And \*none\* of it was written down, and as I write this several years after the fact, we cannot remember the details of the world or the plot.  
  
Here was the premise: there were 3 all-powerful creatures (we did not call them gods for some reason) named King Crusher, Queen Margo, and Fran. The idea was that the King was evil, the Queen was good, and Frank was a middleman between them so they didn’t destroy everything. Again, all of this lore was super vague and unspecified. The premise of Thunder Legends was that Frank had grown tired of the bickering and decided to secure himself some alone time and entertainment, so he trapped everything into a video game. Called Thunder Legends. King Crusher and Queen Margo would both be the main villains of 2 different “chapters” of the game, again heavily Deltarune-inspired at this point. I was the player for the first chapter, and my brother was the player for the second. The real premise was that the supposed villain of the chapter had controlled all of our characters, and we had to battle them to break the curse and bring them to our side.  
  
All of our adventures were entirely improvised, and often themed around one specific character. We would visit a haunted castle to find that possessed knight character, or a town bar to find a gunslinging rat and his compatriots. We would scale large towers of frightening villains to find a group of colorful, fruit-based warriors for some reason, and on and on. Each time we left a place, we would instantly find another hero waiting to try to crush us. There was no “what will you do?” It was a directed adventure, nevertheless covered in random characters, new ones, old ones, ones that didn’t matter like shopkeepers, but nevertheless they all had their own personalities, etc. We were so caught up in the story and the adventure, when we took beach trips, we would go out onto the beach at night, or sometimes during the day, and reenact the battles unfolding in our minds. This world we had created, a culmination of all these characters and their abilities we thought were cool, fighting a menacing villain who was evil for the sake of it. It was, looking back, all ungrounded and not as realistic as a fantasy world should be (if it needs to be at all). It wasn’t the place where an upstart warrior could make a name for himself; it was a dream of the most legendary characters we could think up from their own worlds and times.  
  
So after Thunder Legends ended, we grounded it, even if only a little. We gave each character their own world that they were from, some from the same one, but rarely. We spread them out across a galaxy, all operating on different timelines in different places, but all in the same universe. The “Thunder Universe”, I think we called it. Shortly after, however, the trampolining stopped: I had grown up, I suppose. Trampoline battling was not the first thing a 12-year-old wanted to do anymore (because 12 is sooo mature.) We still did it, but the frequency diminished before we knew what was happening, and before too late, so did the worldbuilding and the imagination.  
  
But then I began really playing Dungeons and Dragons. I had in the past, as I mentioned, but that group had broken up, and I hadn’t played in a while, until one of my friends left, and my other two neighbors decided it would be fun to try. I read the entire Player’s Handbook cover to cover. I read the Dungeon Master’s Handbook cover to cover. It was complicated, it was realistic, and it fueled my mind with all the possibilities I could bring to me and my brother’s world to a more “realistic.” My brother was, however, not going to play with us, so I decided to create some grounding lore myself, but that would come later.   
  
Here is the issue I encountered with DnD. It wasn’t the limited player creation, or the combat, or the magic system (well, kind of, but not for me at this point in my life), it was the lore that came with all of it. Dungeons and Dragons had pre-established planes and gods and creatures and characters, and I didn’t want to learn the lore of another plane written by \*some guy\* (no disrespect, I love the DnD lore); I wanted to expand what I had already imagined, and the two didn’t fit together. Granted, I have used Dnd characters, monsters, items, etc., still do in fact, but the \*world\* I made is like nothing DnD has ever seen. 

Chapter 2: King Ironfist

For my friend, who will remain unnamed, and me, it was not the first time we played DnD, and being young, I think we barely adhered correctly to the rules, so we were rusty to say the least. My neighbor had never played, so as the DM, I had to craft my world to both teach a new player, introduce cool concepts and characters, and relearn how to play the game itself. I landed on a pretty simple fetch quest. The players would start on a train headed to a village with a letter from the “King Ironfist” recruiting them on an adventure to find powerful artifacts in the ruins of a lost fortress that was destroyed. Super straightforward. One player was a dwarven rogue named Thorien Hilltop, and the other was a dragonborn bard named Harvey Iwell. They arrived at the village, got a map, and set out. I gave them the perception of a gnomish wizard sneaking away from the group of adventurers (the king had recruited 100 total adventurers), and naturally, the party investigated, finding this NPC named Liz. Liz was hired privately by the king for a similar quest, to collect these stone tablets. Anyway, the story itself is not really that important. Essentially, the two party members go through the quest and end up at the ruins of the city, and find a dungeon. In the dungeon is where my imagination finally took place. They fought a new enemy called a Guardian. I told them that there was once a great army of Guardians, these construct-like, gargantuan robot golems, and they served the gods long ago. Throughout the story, they had been finding this odd slime of different colors, and consuming each would give a different effect. When they killed the Guardian, it turned into slime, so this was the first time I had foreshadowed something deeper, and the lore was unfurling. After killing it, they got a stone tablet, and meeting with Liz, they placed all the tablets on a golden piano, played a puzzle-melody thing, and unlocked a chest with a crystal gem inside it. It was at this point that the King, Ironfist, appeared and took the crystal from the party. But where did he come from? Oh, he flew in with his wings. Because he was not a king, he was the god King Crusher, who just made mortals find him one of the most powerful things in the universe. The party instantly turned on him and barely escaped with their lives (and the crystal). Throughout a series of running away and other mysteries, they discovered lore and history through cave paintings in dungeons. They found a shrine, and when placing the crystal on the shrine, it created a rift in space, atop the mountain this shrine was on. Importantly, during the adventure, Thorien touched the magic crystal, and his mind was taken to deep space in a temple floating through. He was introduced to the space between worlds called the Void, and the temple they were in was the home of the gods Ironfist, Marcy, and Frank. He was also introduced to another deity-like entity called Ismos, who is the embodiment of the crystal they found (and more). Thorien soon freed his mind from Ismos’ control and left the void. Eventually, King Ironfist (as he became known, nevermore as King Crusher, no idea why) found them, and before he could land the final blow, a hand reached through the portal and dragged him through. It was Queen Margo, and she beat him up. I then asked my players what they wanted to do for the rest of their in-game lives. Harvey said he would travel the world as a bard, and Thorien founded a city with his son he adopted along the way. While this is a crude and minimalist representation of the story, its accuracy is not relevant. The highlight is that they were introduced to a foundation of lore: planets, gods, and the void. I had brought them into a universe that had already been baking in my mind from a culmination of media, trampoline battles, DnD pre-existing lore, and whatever books I had just read. That was all we needed to start, and none of us knew what we were doing.

    After this session, we made several decisions that would shape the world we had unknowingly started to build. The first was that there would never be 1 DM. There were three of us, and we would rotate who creates and runs the story, which obviously let all of us contribute our own imaginations and lore whenever and however we wanted, shaping anything we saw fit. The second was to draw a world map. We got 4 pieces of printer paper, and we all took a page (or two in my case) and drew whatever continent we wanted, and all the mountains and cities, and villages we saw fit. We named cities, valleys, oceans, nations, everything. That day, I went home, copied the map, fixed it up a bit (I was the more artistic of us and wanted the map to look better, I guess), and I took the copies and coffee-stained them, giving us a map that we have used for 5 years now. We named the planet Gehena, and it became the center of our attention in our newfound universe. It could have been that places exploded too quickly, that we didn't want to map out another planet just so a story could take place there, so we stayed on Gehena, and our world was born. The next two campaigns that were run by the others, and not very much happened in them on the worldbuilding front.

Chapter 3: Seasons

    Every time the DM role came all the way around to me, we called the preceding campaigns a season, like a show. So as the seasons roll through, more and more lore is introduced. New factions, races, religions, groups, characters, places, and items. Soon our lore became complicated, and none of us really had it all down. It only being in our heads was the issue, because we all could not remember anything, and by mid-season 2, we needed a solution. Hence, the lore manual. I bought a thick leather notebook, and we named it “Infinity: a finite book of lore.” I guess we thought the name was funny. I spent hours laying out the table of contents and chapters. When we played DnD, it normally got late, and we would sleep over at my neighbor’s house. After cleaning up our dnd stuff, we would lay in bed, and I would get out the lore manual, and we would talk about lore. I would always go through my table of contents and name something that needed work, like the demons, or the dimensions, or the central elements to our universe, and we would delve into it, piece by piece, together. We have been doing this for a while now, and our world has grown so vast that I moved the lore manual to digital so it was easier and faster to keep up with. We write down every character, campaign, world lore, established celestials, demons, angels, groups, cults, religions, places, items, and languages. Everything. It was initially a web on the application Obsidian, but I couldn’t share it without issues, so it was moved to a Google Doc. As I write this, we are in Season 8 (with more pre-history stories and campaigns before it), and the document is currently 455 pages long. 
    
    There is so much I have learned from writing this with my friends, and I feel like my story and experience would be valuable to others who want to do it just like I did when I was 14. Thus, here in the preceding chapters is how (I think) we built our universe: Polythus.

Chapter 4: Advice for starting

    Speaking from my experience, it is far too tedious to lay out everything a good fantasy world needs and go through them one by one, and if you’re trying to make it creative and interesting, that is an even larger and more tedious process. I would say take it bit by bit, and start with what you’re interested in. Make characters and tie their stories together, then ask the questions. Make more stories with them, who thwarts them, where are they, how can they do magic? All those good questions you can ask yourself *as you build* a story. Of course, context matters. If I were to start completely new, I would start with a world map with some creative features, maybe a magic island or a constantly-erupting volcano, something interesting. I would make a character who searches or lives there, and evolve the story from there. (Every character I have ever played has a completely original backstory from a new place with new ideals that shape the world and its lore. Worldbuilding in my case does not end with the DM; there is always space to include your inspirations and imagination.) With multiple people, it is so easy to shift your focus to other parts of the world, other civilizations, letting your minds run wild. Then, when inspiration strikes, carve out a nation and its culture, or all of them. You can give them banners and language, and food, as well as other customs. What animals live on each continent? What groups are there? What alliances exist between nations and factions? Who do they pray to? And it snowballs from there.
    
    Then you ask the big questions. How did the universe begin? How many worlds are there, if any others? Are there separate planes, dimensions, and realities? How did that happen?

Chapter 5: Playing DnD the “fun way”

    Our world, I would say, is loosely similar to that of Dungeons and Dragons, what with having numerous gods and planes, etc., and we still use DnD spells, combat, and character sheets, but we don’t focus on the logistics. It’s not; am I within 5 feet to make a reaction attack of opportunity? Well, sometimes it is, but what I’m trying to say is play loosely. As a DM, my favorite thing is when the players feel like they’ve won. If they trick the villain, or convince him his moral code is flawed, or outright defeat the queen of demons in an epic universe-wide battle, they should feel it, regardless of what the rules say. Can’t they sacrifice their soul to save the world? Who decided that? Bad example, but you get my point. I had a player in one of my campaigns who was a cleric, and the entire campaign up to the end, he revived everyone (very high scope and violent campaign lore-wise). So when he sacrificed himself for his friends to make sure they didn’t die, I played out his death. I took him through the process of a soul. He was examined by our Soul Guardian, a demon, an angel, and Queen Marcy (if you remember her), and he argued his case for returning to life to save his friends. They granted him godhood for his use of his abilities to save others. Granted, that was at the end of a campaign, which would be very overpowered for a player, but I did also let a player become a full-fledged immortal angel and then return to the party. What I’m emphasizing here is don’t let pre-existing rules stop your imagination from having fun. Make the crazy, magical, and unrealistic lore, physics don’t have to apply. Even if you are playing a game like DnD, you don’t have to be tied to their established rules, although for playing games like these, it is an incredible tool and framework. Make your own rules, break them, and adhere to the combat rules, or rules you find accurate and plausible to your world/scenario. I think of Dungeons and Dragons as a way to put yourself and your friends into your minds and basically play pretend together, as childish as it sounds. It's a medium of storytelling. One that is particularly unrepresented.
    
    So I would say that when playing DnD, especially for worldbuilding, do what sounds awesome. There are really no restrictions on what you can or cannot make. If you want to make a magic scroll that can reset the timeline for some reason, so be it. If you want to make the first creator god have a twin and, based on that, create a separate reality, go for it. If you see something cool on Instagram and you want to include an aspect of it, why not? But I would not just dump it all into a doc. I would not just write character backstories. Have characters actively doing, actively interacting with others. Build their cultures and their world. Because I believe these worlds are built on the back of stories, on impact, emotion, and personal inspiration and interest.

I run what I call a “sandbox” campaign. I outline what is happening in the universe at that time in a couple of bullets, with maybe an NPC profile or two, and a brief session 0. Then it’s improv and a subtle direction to the plot. (Of course, sometimes I have been known to overly plan out interactions or the plot, and sometimes everything, but not to the extent normal DMs do. When making a compelling narrative, planning is often your best friend unless you’re *really good* at improvising.) The way we play is chaotic, it's unique, and my players don’t feel railroaded at all: when there is a clear path filled with lore, they often choose it out of curiosity and not necessity. This makes our campaigns very personal, open to player expression and creativity, and far more inspired, I would say.

Chapter 6: Bland vs Tasty

    One thing I struggled with for a little bit was what to include in my campaigns to make them unique and add to the lore in a way no other world had before. I solved this by starting a notes app page, and anytime I heard something interesting, whether from a book, show, movie, or social media, I wrote it down for inspiration. 

We live in an age where being unique is so easy. Find an aesthetic or theme you like, research maybe a real cultural meaning behind it, and make names based on that. Take an animal and give it a magical property like being on fire or something. Merge things that have nothing to do with each other. Take elements of real life and fantasize them. AI, I have also found, is very helpful at giving a personal interpretation of your lore. My friends and I have often given it lists of NPCs and character builds and asked it to rank them based on their power, or uniqueness, or character arcs by the end of the campaign, etc. If you ever need someone to talk to about your lore, attach a file of it to AI and just ask it questions to see if it understands. It makes sure your story and lore is digestible enough, at least if you ask the right prompts. Another easy source of inspiration is the internet. I am currently running a steampunk/magic fuel campaign, and just now, while writing this, I looked up a steampunk city and found something completely unrelated while looking at the images, and now I have more ideas. If you are trying to be unique, don’t steal people’s work and ideas, obviously, just take little bits. Say “oh, that’s cool” and incorporate it, but make it even more interesting and special to *your* world. Don’t see a flying city and say, “That’s cool, let me show that image to my players and put that exact thing in my world.” You say, “I want to make a flying city, but it's going to look like this, or this culture will build/own it…” There is no such thing as bad inspiration, I would say. Take what interests you and turn it up to 100.

    If your world is straightforward, that’s great, but I would say you should make it *fantastical*. That’s the appeal of these worlds you build, whether for a game or a book or both. You should feel as if you stepped in; there would always be something that excited you. My universe, Polythus, is vast, and half of the characters and items are just random jokes or references, which is part of the appeal, but the stories we make, between my friends and me, are real, and the world becomes richer and richer every campaign. Every political scandal, every new NPC, the world grows into something none of us recognize from the little town setting of the very first campaign. Our lore document is now canonically written by one of my played characters, and has information from the beginning of time onwards. We have completely redone time, seasons, language, magic (oh boy, there is so much magic lore), and everything that makes a world. We wanted to put ourselves and our minds into as much of our real lives as possible, and twist and turn it, reimagining it until it was *ours*.

Chapter 7: Final Words

    If I had to make a universe again, here are the steps I would take, because I feel like no one ever gives actionable advice anymore. My primary advice is to build off of interest and story. Establishing a long list of to-dos and rules is just going to hold you down. Be free, take inspiration, create, create, create, change things, then create more. Build off of whatever captivated you about worldbuilding in the first place. Here is my track I would take if I had to do it again:  

1. Create a compelling character (think OC)
2. Create their backstory
3. Create their connections or where they’re from
4. Make another
5. Make a couple more
6. How do they interact?
7. What happens when they do?
8. Where are they?
9. How do they do what they do from a lore perspective?
10. What does the world look like? (Map draft)
11. What do the nations look like?
12. What sets them apart?
13. How about the culture, creatures, and landscape of each area?
14. Final draft of Map
15. How was the world itself made?
16. Are there gods? How did they get their power?
17. How was the universe made, and what does time and space look like here?
18. Who made the mortal people? Why?
19. Where do all the people reside? Just on one planet or many?
20. Interesting flair and opportunity for more creativity, such as, but not limited to: different planes and dimensions, great magical beasts, prehistory, lore for the creation of the gods, angels, demons, souls, and where they come from/go, etc.. You can also do this at the beginning, and it often motivates you in your creation to move in the thematic direction you want.
21. Make more stories, and each time add some interesting and inspiration-driven ideas or characters
22. Every once and a while, step back and define your world like languages spoken or special races, classes, etc.
23. Lay out your lore in a simple way that is easy to flip between concepts, easy to edit, and easy to share if you are with multiple people.
24. Do whatever you want.
25. I had a monster-making phase for a while
26. Keep going until your world is covered in deep lore, maps, amazing characters you barely remember because there is so much magic, technology, politics, worlds, gods, dimensions, planes… and on and on
27. Ask opinions, whether from AI if it’s honest, or from people who would care and give genuine advice
28. Take more inspiration, feel free to retcon anything you want to change (unless you play with people, and that would mean re-writing their actions), although I have overwritten backstories (with their consent and help) before. Make your world *yours*
29. Build an identity for your world. Is it dark and mysterious, fantastical and wonderful, comedic, or a mixture of all of them? Such is life
30. Make stories
31. Then make more
32. And more
33. And more
34. Then write a book about it
35. And become a millionaire
36. Buy a mansion
37. Never worry about money again
38. Make more stories
39. Because it's fun

You get the point, it should be story-driven because it is honestly the most interesting part of the lore, and I’m not even a history guy. If you want to prepare a world *before* you have players in it, or write a book about it, I would say you should introduce them at about number 21, but again, you should still be making the world *yours* (you and your group or just you if you’re awesome, I guess).

I don’t know if I’ll put this anywhere because I wrote it in an hour, and it is a short representation of how vast and long this world has been building. (Over 4 years, starting from when I began playing DnD, which is when the world-building aspect truly began in my eyes. Also, the only reason it took this long is that it was built through campaigns; I’m sure you could build an interesting and compelling world in far less time.) This is in no way a straight pathed process, although I tried my best to give you the path I took. For you people like me in groups, a reminder that sometimes other people have better ideas than you do. And it’s worth exploring them just as much. Again, probably won’t post it, but in case I do, I hope this helps. I would post my lore doc, but I don’t want what is unique to my group, and our stories and ideas, to be taken and used elsewhere, because I am rather possessive of my universe. Hope this helps your worldbuilding! Let me know if you end up reading all the way :)",2,1767510979.0,worldbuilding,0,1.0,False
1q3jikt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Coletrain96/comments/1q3jikt/fractal_indifference/,Fractal Indifference,"Darkness crept over the horizon, erasing the view more and more with each breath. Jack Buchannan took it in, awestruck as always. For three generations the Buchannans had been the keepers of this land. Life times of struggle and strife had built it to what it now was; thirty thousand acres of corn, cotton, and cattle. Every inch blessed by God. Every inch hallowed ground. 

Jack sat on his old Ford tractor and almost shed a joyous tear. Almost.

Down the valley a piece, Something drug his attention away. As the night stretched on, closing in on him, he saw *it*. Whatever it was, it was moving real fast straight towards him. Wolves had been gone from these parts for decades. Coyote? Maybe. Then again, maybe it was some kids from town. Supper was going to have to wait. No one messed with Buchannan land. No one.  

In a few short heartbeats, Jack threw the tractor into motion and drew his pistol from its holster. Behind him, guarded only by three strands of barbed wire, his main herd idled. He had to keep them safe. 

Night now fell like a blanket of uncertainty, eating every bit of clarity he had. Two summers ago, on a night much like this, he had turned the tractor over while trying to move the herd. The headlights had shattered. Town was forty five minutes out of his way and the Ace closed at 7p.m. 

“Damnit,” he thought, not for the first time. He should have replaced the lights.

Up ahead, and closing fast, the shape seemed to grow. What was once a small shape no taller than the cotton it ran in, now seemed to be a hulking *thing,* towering over the reedy plants.

Jack pressed in the clutch, bringing the tractor to a manageable speed. As he slowed down to a stop, he braced himself and aimed. Fear lanced through his mind. 

*What am I looking at?* he thought. The shape kept changing. Small then big. Long now short. Fat, skinny, fast, faster. It made no sense. He shook his head and took a deep breath.

100 yards. He had to wait till it was closer.

75 yards. Sweat seemed to pour from his hands.

50 yards. He thought he could see some jagged mouth where the head should be.

25 yards. He clicked the safety off and squeezed.

**BANG!**

Jack saw stars, then nothing at all.

Back at the top of the hill, eight hundred head of cattle bellowed simultaneously, then wandered off. The old tractor kept drifting forward.

\---

Jack sat up in a rush. His lungs pumped hard, filling him with cold air as fear flooded his veins. It was bright, like looking into the hot sun while working the land.  He blinked rapidly as everything came into focus.

He was… in his bedroom.

*What on earth?*

He grabbed his clock and tugged it towards him. The wire snagged, sending his bible and pocket knife clattering to the floor.

11:43 a.m. That couldn’t be right, there was no way he slept that long. Yet, when he looked out his window, it seemed far too true. The sun was already high enough to bleach the thin curtains pale, yet there were no flies at the window, no cattle lowing in the distance, no wind worrying the cotton. His bedroom smelled wrong, too. Not of dust and oil and old wood, but of something thin and sharp, like rain that never quite fell.

His head was killing him, his joints ached, and his chest felt tight. He stumbled to the bathroom and washed his face. The water was ice cold. When he looked in the mirror, everything was blurry. He rubbed his eyes, but nothing changed. Looking around, everything else was clear.

*I’ve gone and lost my mind.*  
No, not lost it. Misplaced it.

The cows needed to be moved today, and it was surely noon now. He had broken his father’s golden rule. Never sleep in when there is work to do.

Hurriedly, he left the house. At the edge of the yard, where the fence began, he froze. The cows were gathered in strange clusters. Three huddled close to the fence, then a patch of seven farther off, another three nearer still, forming a rhythm he could not make sense of. They never came this close to the house. He took a step forward, then another, squinting at the unusual pattern.

Perplexed but set in his ways, Jack shouted, sending the cows further into the field. They moved reluctantly, glancing back at him in a way that made his stomach twist. All obeyed, eventually, but it felt like forcing a river uphill.

When he reached the barn, he stopped short. The tractor, his old Ford parked just as he had left it last night, was gone. He rubbed his eyes again, heart thudding. Empty space. He had stored it away last night, when…

A low, resonant bellow rolled across the pasture. The sound pressed against his skull, unnatural in rhythm and tone. His headache throbbed, spreading down his neck. The cows bellowed again, a chorus that did not sound right, that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Jack swallowed hard. Something was very wrong.

The cows had stopped, once again bunching up. Jack tried to count them but couldn’t make sense of it. Every time he started, the numbers slipped from his mind. 

Jack stepped forward, trying again to separate the cows. His boots sank slightly into the soft earth, though it had rained only yesterday. Each step felt heavier than it should. The clusters shifted slightly as he moved, reforming into patterns he could not comprehend. He tried to count them. One, two, three… the numbers vanished from his mind as quickly as he thought them.

The wind whispered across the field, thin and sharp, carrying a sound he could not name. The horizon did not look right. Hills he had crossed a hundred times seemed farther away, stretched unnaturally, as if the land itself had grown taller while he slept. He rubbed his eyes, but the stretch remained.

And then he heard it again. Not the bellowing, but a faint vibration beneath his feet, steady, almost deliberate. Jack froze. The world was watching him now, he was sure of it. In the corner of his vision, a dark shape appeared. When he turned to look, it was gone. Yet again he turned to the cows, but the shape bloomed back in his peripheral vision. 

He tried once more to focus on it, but a wave of nausea rolled through him. His stomach clenched hard. His mouth filled with something thick and bitter. He staggered, bent double, and retched onto the ground.

For a long moment he stayed there, shaking, spitting, trying to clear the taste from his mouth. When he finally straightened, his head was pounding, his legs weak, and the shape was gone.

Only the land remained. Watching.

\---

Jack’s eyes shot open. A surge of anxiety jolted him upright, tangling him in the comforter as he slid off the edge of the bed.

He freed himself with a heavy breath and sat on the mattress. The clock read 6:15 a.m. That seemed right. Out his window, he saw the faint morning light painting the land. A bird sang somewhere nearby. The branches of his favorite oak tree swayed in a breeze. 

He felt… better.

Jack made his way to the bathroom and washed his face. When he looked in the mirror, his own tired face looked back. It was clear and focused.

He let out a sigh and walked lightly to the kitchen. Coffee brewed on the counter, and the warm, familiar smell perked him up a bit more.

Jack carried his mug to the back door and stood there for a moment, letting the warmth soak into his hands and the familiar smells of coffee and old wood and morning air settle him. The pale light through the window had the same quiet promise it always had, the sort that made work feel possible again.

He opened the door.

The breeze he had seen in the oak tree did not reach him. The leaves still moved, whispering softly to one another, but the air against his face was perfectly still, heavy and unmoving in a way that made him pause before stepping forward.

When he stepped onto the porch, the boards did not creak beneath his weight. That should have been impossible. This house sang with every footstep. He shifted, deliberately this time, pressing his heel down, then his toes, but the wood did not answer him. The mug was warm in his hands. The railing was solid beneath his fingers. Only the sound was missing, and the faint, unreasonable certainty that something about that mattered.

“Morning,” he murmured, more out of habit than expectation.

His voice felt swallowed before it finished leaving his mouth. He went down the steps and into the yard, and it was only then that he noticed the grass did not move around his boots. The blades brushed his ankles, cool and sharp, but they did not bend, did not part, did not show any sign that he had passed through them at all. He stopped and crouched, pressed his hand flat against the green and felt its texture clearly beneath his palm. When he lifted his hand, nothing rose with it. The grass had not been pressed.

A slow unease began to coil in his chest. He straightened and looked toward the pasture.

The cows were still there, scattered along the fence in their strange, uneven groupings, their sides rising and falling as they breathed. He raised a hand and waved, then lifted his voice and called out, the way he had a thousand times before, but no heads turned. No ears flicked. It was as if the sound had never reached them.

He picked up a small stone and tossed it between two of them. It disappeared into the grass beyond without so much as a startled twitch.

The perplexity of it all left him hollow. He made his way to the barn, each step dragging like a thousand. His heartbeat quickened, and the rhythm of it seemed to spill outward, threading into the world itself. Every footfall matched an invisible pulse. Every breath raised the crescendo, and for a fleeting moment he felt as though the land itself was moving with him, not around him.  

The barn loomed in front of him, seeming to swell with his heart and lungs. The wood pulsed, growing and stretching to extreme proportions. As he stumbled forward, the doors opened by themselves. Inside, his tractor sat running. The headlights were on, shining directly in his eyes, though the engine smelled faintly of ozone instead of oil

*I… when did I?...*

The engine’s humming invaded his every sense, its vibration pitching in time with the rhythm that seemed to surround him. A pulsing headache bloomed behind his eyes, and shapes, impossible and shifting, unfolded in his vision as if the world itself were bending inside his skull.

Jack’s vision sharpened instead of blurring. The pain behind his eyes drew tight, not like a wound but like a lens being turned into focus, and the world shifted with it. The barn no longer held a single shape. Its walls layered over themselves, boards overlapping boards that were not there a moment before, angles folding into angles that should not have fit. The space inside it felt deeper than its outside allowed, a hollow that opened inward rather than containing.

The tractor’s headlights shone forward and backward at once. The beams did not stop at the far wall but slid through it into something that was not darkness but depth.

Lines ran everywhere. Through the dirt floor, through the walls, through the tractor’s metal frame, through his own hands and arms. Some were thick, some thin, some vibrating so fast they were only a shimmer, all crossing and bending and tangling through one another in patterns that made his stomach tighten and his breath come shallow.

Not the surfaces he had always known, not the shapes he named and trusted. This was a structure that held everything in place while pretending not to exist.

“Holy Christ!” he screamed. Nothing felt real. His stomach turned to lead.  

Jack swayed on his feet, one hand braced against the tractor’s hood. The metal felt wrong now, too warm and too distant at the same time. The engine’s hum no longer sounded like sound. It was a pressure that moved through him, a vibration that matched something deeper than his ears, something that seemed to run through his bones and into the ground beneath him.

He lifted his head.

Where many of the lines bent sharply inward, where their paths twisted tight around a point that was not quite a point, something stood.

It was not a shape in any way he could name. It had no clear edge, no surface, no form that stayed consistent from one moment to the next.

It had been in the field. It had been in the barn. It had been beneath his feet since the moment he woke. The thing did not turn toward him in any way that space could describe, but he felt its attention settle on him all the same, like a change in pressure, like the sudden awareness of being looked at in a dark room.

Jack took a step back.

The space behind him did not behave as it should have. The barn stretched away instead of receding. The floor did not carry him so much as slide beneath him, and the distance he tried to create did not feel like distance at all, but like a rearrangement.

He swayed a moment before falling to the floor. The lines tightened. He felt like he was floating, carried through the world in a mist he couldn’t see.

The thing did not move closer. It did not need to.

His heart hammered, and with each beat the world seemed to answer, a subtle tightening and release that ran through the barn, through the land beyond it, through the air and the ground and the sky above.

His breath came in shallow gasps. The pressure in his skull built higher and higher, images tumbling through his brains. Curves without radius, angles that bent inward on themselves, depths that opened in places that should have been flat. His hands trembled.

The thing’s presence deepened. Not closer. Clearer.

Jack cried out, though he did not hear the sound. The lines did not fade. The world did not return.

He was still inside the barn when his eyes felt like they ruptured. Brilliant colors exploded across every surface.

The *thing* drew closer, until all the colors vanished. All that existed was black.

It was all black.

\---

Jack opened his eyes. There was no light, no darkness. There just *was.*

Bands of deep purple swirled with emerald green. Pinks and yellows converged and dissipated. Shapes flowed between it all, bending and breathing with him.

He lay there, taking it all in. Not because he chose to, but movement was all the same. He was both there and not. 

He rose with nothing but a thought. The light bent to his will and folded around him. He walked out what was once his front door. Patterns greeted him, all in varying degrees of intricacy. 

Jack moved, gliding forward, or was it backwards? He didn’t know nor care where he went. As shapes moved past him, he reached out and touched them. Some multiplied, some dissipated.

The patterns moved, replicated, subjugated, all at once.

And the place where Jack Buchannan was, existed, and ceased. ",2,1767510932.0,u_Coletrain96,0,1.0,False

**TACTICAL LOG: OPERATIONAL GROUP ""TRIDENT""** **Location:** S.L.A.M. Equatorial Platform Alpha (Indian Ocean) **Time:** April 25, 204X – 23:45 Local Time **Unit:** DEVGRU Red Squadron / Task Force 88 **Mission:** SEIZURE / HVT SECURE

The Indian Ocean was a flat, black mirror. To the naked eye, there was nothing but the dark horizon and the distant, towering lights of the Platform, rising like an oil rig on steroids.

But Lieutenant Commander Washington (callsign ""Viper"") wasn't looking with naked eyes. His panoramic NVGs painted the world in a crisp, white-phosphor monochrome.

""Alpha Team, status,"" he whispered into his bone-conduction mic.

""Alpha in position. Mag-locks engaged on the North Pylon. We are ghost,"" came the reply.

""Bravo, breaching the sub-sea maintenance hatch. Thirty seconds to interior.""

Viper checked his wrist display. The operation was textbook. The USS *Virginia* had dropped them five miles out, running silent. Their delivery vehicles—advanced swimmer delivery sleds—had brought them right up to the massive composite legs of the Space Elevator's base station. They had bypassed three sonar nets and a thermal curtain.

The S.L.A.M. security was a joke. Automated patrols, yes, but predictable. Civilian-grade. Reid might be a genius physicist, but he clearly didn't know a damn thing about perimeter defense.

""Command, this is Viper. Outer perimeter breached. No resistance. Proceeding to the Control Center to secure the hard-line.""

""Copy Viper. The President wants that elevator locked down before the morning news cycle. Green light on all targets of opportunity. If it resists, frag it.""

The team reached the nearest mooring of the harbor to the space elevator, moving in the shadow of a gigantic container ship that was disgorging containers onto the floating platform at breakneck speed.

The harbor was a void. Beyond the harsh floodlights bathing the container ship, the darkness was absolute—a light-swallowing black that even the panoramic NVGs struggled to penetrate. Washington signaled for a perimeter check, moving low against the damp steel.

Then, the air itself seemed to tighten.

It wasn't a sound. It was a physical pressure that hit them in the chest, rhythmic and crushing. *Thrum.* The Ascendant was firing. Every sixty seconds, a hundred-ton cargo pod was punched into the sky, riding a wave of electromagnetic force so dense it tasted like copper on the tongue.

Washington’s headset didn't just go dead; it screamed. A high-pitched squeal of overloaded circuits tore through the bone-conduction loop before silencing instantly. His HUD flickered—vital signs, maps, objectives—then dissolved into grey snow.

He tapped his helmet. Dead. He looked at Alpha Two. The operator was frantically tapping his wrist comp, shaking his head. The Intel boys had prepped them for RF jamming, but not for this—a brute-force magnetic pulse occurring every minute.

Ten minutes in, and they were deaf, dumb, and blind to Command. Washington sliced a hand across his throat: *Comms cut.* He raised two fingers, then pointed to eyes. *Visuals only. We go dark.*

In the suffocating darkness, spatial orientation disintegrated. The only anchor was the distant, throbbing light of the Elevator shaft, miles away across the platform. Washington moved by instinct, guided by the faint phosphorescence of the salt spray.

Then, the air pressure dropped.

It wasn't a wind; it was a displacement. A massive, invisible wall of force *whooshed* past them, inches from Washington's shoulder. It was silent—terrifyingly so. No engine roar, no friction scream. Just the terrifying sensation of immense mass moving at speed.

Then another. *Whoosh.*

Then another.

The containers. The ship was unloading them, and they were gliding autonomously toward the elevator on unseen magnetic rails, cutting through the darkness like silent trains.

""Hold! Freeze!"" Washington roared, forgetting silence discipline, his voice cracking with sudden, primal fear.

He spun around to check his six, his NVGs scanning the line. ""Sound off! Count off!""

Silence.

""Alpha Two? Alpha Three?""

Nothing.

Washington grabbed the shoulder of the man behind him—Alpha Five. The man was shaking, pointing a trembling finger into the dark.

Washington looked.

A split second of illumination from a passing strobe caught the next container gliding past. It was a standard ISO unit, forty feet of steel weighing a hundred tons. But the front face wasn't smooth grey metal.

It was wet.

Smeared across the impact plate of the silent juggernaut was a horrific, unrecognizable paste of crushed ceramic armor, night-vision optics, and organic matter. Red pulp.

Three men. Gone. Erased in a second by a silent, indifferent logistic algorithm that didn't even register a collision.

Washington forced the panic down, shoving it into a dark corner of his mind. He couldn't scream. He couldn't mourn. He could only command.

""Move,"" he signaled, his hand shaking slightly before clenching into a fist. ""We finish this.""

They advanced into the belly of the machine. It was a harrowing, terrifying trudge through a valley of death where the reapers were silent algorithms and invisible magnetic fields.

They lost two more men at the primary rail junction—caught in the slipstream of a high-speed loader that moved faster than human reflexes could register. One second they were there; the next, a red mist hung in the humid air.

Nine became seven.

Then, the drones returned. Not the welders this time, but heavy lifters, indifferent to the soft biological obstacles in their path. Alpha Six was crushed against a pylon. Alpha Eight was swept over the edge into the black ocean below.

Seven became four.

But they didn't break. The terror that should have paralyzed them was forged into a grim, unbreakable resolve. They were the tip of the spear, and the spear does not stop until it strikes or shatters. They moved with a mechanical precision born of desperation, vaulting over coolant pipes, dodging the rhythmic pistons of the auto-loaders.

They reached the final maintenance gantry. Lungs burning, muscles screaming, the four survivors clawed their way up the slick durasteel ladder.

Washington crested the ridge first. He raised his weapon, scanning the platform.

There.

Two hundred meters ahead, suspended like a spider's nest in the center of the magnetic web, sat the target. The Control Center. The brain of the beast.

**THE WHITE HOUSE – SITUATION ROOM** **Time: 00:15 EST**

""We lost the feed,"" General Vance said, slamming his fist on the table. ""All telemetry from Trident is gone.""

""Did they secure the asset?"" President Whitmore asked, sweating.

""We don't know. The last transmission was... confused. They reported the structure was attacking them.""

“They are highly trained Mr President, even without communications, they will follow through”

“Ok, Admiral, where is our carrier fleet?”

""Carrier Strike Group Five is holding station at rendezvous point Zulu. They are sanitizing the airspace over **Pulau Lingga** as we speak. Birds are on the deck, sir. They launch on your mark.""

Director Cohen didn't speak. He just stared at his tablet, his face draining of color. He didn't ask for permission; he swiped a finger across the glass, casting his feed to the main display.

""Sir. You need to see this. It just hit the AP wire.""

The screen lit up with a breaking news alert, flashing in urgent red.

**FLASH // URGENT: ENTIRE CREW OF USS VIRGINIA RECOVERED BY CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP 'OCEAN PRIDE' 20NM SOUTH OF SLAM PLATFORM. CAPTAIN REPORTS SUBMARINE SUFFERED CATASTROPHIC POWER FAILURE AND FORCED SURFACING. NO CASUALTIES.**

The silence in the room wasn't just heavy; it was absolute. It was the sound of a superpower realizing it was bleeding.

Admiral Blackwood slowly lowered himself into his chair, his eyes wide. ""The *Virginia*... is a Block V fast-attack boat. It doesn't just... fail.""

""He didn't just blind them,"" Cohen whispered, looking at the President with dawning horror. ""He just sank their ride home. Trident is stranded, sir. They are on that rock alone.""

""Get me Admiral Sterling,"" Whitmore commanded, his voice tight. ""I need to know we still have teeth.""

The main screen shifted. The seal of the US Navy flashed, replaced by the live feed from the flag bridge of the USS *Gerald R. Ford*.

Admiral Sterling stood in the center of the frame, the very image of American naval supremacy. Behind him, the bridge was a hive of disciplined, quiet activity. Through the blast windows, the night was pitch black, punctuated only by the red and green running lights of the F-35s on the catapults.

""Mr. President,"" Sterling said, his voice calm, cutting through the static. ""Strike Group Five is Green. We are holding station. The airspace is sanitized. We are ready to rain hell on your command. Launch in T-minus two minutes.""

""Do it, Admiral. Clear the board.""

""Aye, sir. All stations, this is Flag. Initiate—""

The Admiral didn't finish the sentence.

It didn't start with a bang. It started with a *click*. The sound of a thousand magnetic locks engaging simultaneously across the length of the thousand-foot vessel.

The proximity of the magnetic field of the elevator and the combat readiness of the mighty ship activated a hidden 'security' routine in the main operation computer.

Deep in the bovels of the beast, in the brand new main coolant pump regulators, nano particles started to invade the entire nuclear generators, and from there all the commands systems.

Then came the scream.

*WHOOP. WHOOP. WHOOP.*

The bridge lighting died, replaced instantly by the sickly, rotating amber of the NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) alarm.

""Radiological warning!"" the Tactical Action Officer shrieked, his face bathed in the yellow light. ""Sensors detect a catastrophic core breach in Reactor Two! Lethal levels!""

""Scram the pile!"" Sterling roared. ""Dump the rods!""

""I can't!"" The Engineering officer was hammering his console, panic rising in his voice. ""The system has initiated 'Protocol Omega'. It's a containment lockdown. Sir... the blast doors.""

On the main monitor, the internal CCTV feeds popped up. They showed heavily armored watertight doors slamming shut in corridors, mess halls, and engine rooms. Sailors were banging on the thick steel, their faces twisted in confusion that was rapidly turning to terror.

""They're sealed in,"" the XO whispered. ""The whole engineering watch... they're trapped in the containment zone.""

""Override!"" Sterling commanded. ""Send a team to manual control!""

""We can't, sir! The bulkheads are locked! The ship thinks we're leaking radiation everywhere! It quarantined the propulsion section!""

Then, the floor tilted.

""Helm!""

""She's not answering, Admiral!"" The helmsman was fighting the wheel, veins bulging in his neck, but the heavy controls were dead. ""Rudder is locked hard over! 15 degrees starboard!""

A deep, guttural vibration shuddered through the deck plates. The engines.

""Turbines are spooling up,"" the helmsman cried out, looking at the RPM gauges climbing into the red. ""We are going to Flank Speed! She's running away with us!""

In the White House, the silence was broken by the terrified voice of a superpower losing its grip.

""Where is she going?"" Whitmore demanded. ""Blackwood, give me a vector!""

Admiral Blackwood stared at the tactical plot. The blue icon of the *Gerald R. Ford* was tracing a straight, accelerating line. It wasn't heading for the open ocean.

It was heading for the rocky shoreline of **Pulau Lingga**.

""It's a mutiny,"" Vance whispered, staring at the screen. ""But it is the ship mutinying.""

""He's not stealing the ship,"" Blackwood said, his voice cracking. ""He's executing it.""

On the screen, the coastline was visible now through the bridge windows—a dark mass rushing closer at terrified speed.

""Impact in ninety seconds,"" Blackwood stated, closing his eyes. ""He is driving a hundred thousand tons of nuclear-powered steel directly into the island at flank speed. He's going to crash her, sir. He's going to break her back.""

""Impact,"" the tactical officer whispered.

The blue icon merged with the landmass. The telemetry feed flatlined. The *Gerald R. Ford*, the pride of the fleet, was gone—wrecked on the shores of an Indonesian island by its own brain.

The room held its breath, waiting for the scream, the outburst, the grief.

It never came.

President Whitmore didn't flinch. He didn't look away. He stared at the dead screen for a single heartbeat, his face a mask of terrifying, frozen calculation. Then, he turned.

""Get me the Second Fleet,"" he commanded, his voice devoid of tremor.

""Sir?"" Vance blinked, still processing the catastrophe. ""The *Ford* just—""

""The *Ford* is a sunk cost, General,"" Whitmore cut him off, ice in his tone. ""We have a war to win. Get me Admiral Lasky on the *Enterprise*. They are holding in the North Atlantic. If we can't hit him from the Pacific, we burn him from the roof of the world.""

""Connecting,"" the comms officer said, his hands shaking.

The main screen flickered. The static cleared to reveal the bridge of the USS *Enterprise* (CVN-80). But the scene wasn't the orderly command center Whitmore expected. Smoke hung in the air. Technicians were running with fire extinguishers.

Admiral Lasky stepped into the frame. He was covered in soot. He didn't salute.

""Mr. President,"" Lasky coughed. ""I assume you're calling for a strike package.""

""Launch everything, Admiral,"" Whitmore ordered. ""Full spread. Target the Tether.""

""We can't, sir,"" Lasky said flatly.

Whitmore’s eyes narrowed. ""Refusal of orders is treason, Admiral.""

""It's not refusal, sir. It's capability."" Lasky stepped aside, pointing through the blast glass to the flight deck.

It was a graveyard of ambition. A squadron of F-35s sat paralyzed on the deck. But the catapults... the tracks weren't straight lines of steel. They were warped, glowing cherry-red in the twilight.

""The EMALS,"" Lasky spat the acronym like a curse. ""The electromagnetic launch system. Five minutes ago, we experienced a power surge. It didn't trip the breakers. It melted the coils. The magnetic catapults are fused solid, Mr. President. We can't launch a paper airplane, let alone a fighter.""

He turned back to the camera.

""And the weapons elevators are seized between decks. The command circuits are fried. We are a hundred-thousand-ton floating hotel, sir. I have issued the order to come about. We are limping back to Norfolk for repairs.""

The feed cut out.

Whitmore stood in the center of the ruin of American power. The Pacific Fleet was wrecked. The Atlantic Fleet was castrated. The Trident team was silent.

Reid hadn't just defeated the United States military. He had dismantled it, piece by piece, from his living room.

Whitmore didn't scream. He didn't rage. He simply turned his back on the screens showing the smoking ruins of his conventional power and looked at the single, isolated monitor on the far wall.

It displayed a high-altitude vector map of the Western Pacific. The ocean was black. The land was green. And crawling across the stratosphere, sixty thousand feet above the chaos, were two solitary white pixels.

Ghost 1 and Ghost 2.

B-21 Raiders. The unseen blade. They had been loitering for six hours, running silent, waiting for the order that no President ever wanted to give. But the fleets were gone. The blockade was broken. The world was watching the United States bleed.

Whitmore looked at those two dots. They were the only thing left that couldn't be hacked, couldn't be stopped by a clever algorithm. Physics still worked. A falling star still burned.

The room went cold. The air conditioning hummed, sounding like a roar in the sudden, suffocating silence. Every general, every aide, every analyst knew what was coming. They stopped breathing.

Whitmore extended his hand, palm up. His voice was a whisper, but it carried the weight of the end of the world.

""The Football.""

The military aide, a young Major whose face had gone ash-grey, stepped forward with the heavy black briefcase. He placed it on the table. The click of the latches opening sounded like gunshots.

Whitmore took the laminated card—the ""Biscuit""—from his pocket. He snapped it open.

""General Vance,"" Whitmore said, his eyes dead. ""Authenticate.""

""Sierra. Tango. Nine. Victor. Alpha,"" Vance recited, his voice shaking.

""Authentication confirmed,"" Whitmore said. He punched the sequence into the comms link. ""This is National Command Authority. Flash Traffic to Ghost Flight. Reference Plan Omega.""

He looked at the two white dots.

""Release the package.""

The room waited for the confirmation code. The 'Weapons Away' signal that would mark the point of no return.

It never came.

Instead, the two white pixels simply vanished.

""Lost contact!"" the comms officer shouted, his voice cracking. ""Ghost Flight has dropped off the net!""

""Did they drop the payload?"" Whitmore demanded, leaning over the table. ""Did they release?""

""No confirmation! Transponders are dead!""

The room erupted. Generals were shouting into phones that were dead or jammed. Analysts were frantically rebooting consoles. It was pandemonium—the blind panic of men who had pulled a trigger and didn't know where the bullet had gone.

""Mr. President!""

The shout came from a young intelligence aide in the back corner. He wasn't looking at the main screen. He was looking at a raw feed from a weather satellite on his laptop. He looked sick.

""Put it on the main,"" Whitmore whispered.

The screen flickered. The vector map of the Pacific disappeared. In its place appeared a satellite overlay of the Asian continent.

Two faint, pulsing distress beacons were blinking. But they weren't over the Indian Ocean. They weren't even close to the Space Elevator.

They were deep inside the People's Republic of China.

""They're not over the target,"" Vance breathed, his legs giving out. ""My God. Where are they?""

""Sichuan Province,"" the aide said, his voice trembling. ""Sir, we just received a burst transmission from Ghost One via emergency low-band. Their navigation systems... they were compromised four hours ago. They thought they were on an attack vector south of India.""

""They've been flying over China for four hours?"" Whitmore gripped the table, his knuckles white. ""With live nuclear warheads?""

""It gets worse,"" the aide whispered.

On the screen, new icons appeared around the distress signals. Red icons.

""Ghost Leader reports visual contact,"" the aide read from the scrolling text, tears streaming down his face. ""Six PLAAF J-20 Mighty Dragons. They have lock-on. They are forcing them to land at Chengdu Air Base.""

Whitmore closed his eyes. The nuclear bombers hadn't been stopped. They had been delivered—hand-delivered—to the United States' greatest rival, complete with their payloads and their encryption keys.

Reid hadn't just disarmed them. He had framed them for an act of war he knew they couldn't win.

**THE FINAL BLOW**

The silence in the Situation Room was broken by the chirping of a notification. Not a red alert. Not a nuclear warning. Just a standard media monitoring alert.

""Sir,"" the press secretary whispered, looking at her phone as if it were an alien artifact. ""CNN is live from Singapore. You need to see this.""

Whitmore looked up from the abyss of his defeat. ""Put it on.""

The main screen, which had just displayed the end of American hegemony, flickered. The terrifying red icons of the compromised bombers vanished.

In their place was blinding, high-definition sunlight.

The shot was aerial, swooping down over the iconic rooftop infinity pool of the Marina Bay Sands. The water was a dazzling turquoise, merging seamlessly with the skyline of a city that looked like it had been scrubbed clean of all the world's dirt.

There, at a private table under a white parasol, sat the man who had just dismantled the US Navy and hijacked its nuclear arsenal.

Georges Reid was wearing a linen shirt, unbuttoned at the collar. He was buttering a croissant. Opposite him, Clarissa Tang—the woman the intelligence reports called the ""White Widow""—was laughing at something he had just said, looking radiant and utterly unbothered.

Below them, on the public observation deck, a crowd of thousands was cheering, waving flags with the S.L.A.M. logo. They weren't screaming in terror. They were cheering in adoration.

Reid looked up, shielding his eyes from the sun. He spotted the news drone. He didn't hide. He didn't look like a Bond villain plotting in a bunker.

He smiled. A genuine, relaxed, devastatingly charming smile. He raised his coffee cup in a lazy, negligent toast to the camera, then turned back to his breakfast.

The news chyron scrolled across the bottom of the screen in cheerful blue and white:

**LIVE: BILLIONAIRE 'SAVIOR' SPOTTED ENJOYING SUNDAY BRUNCH. WITNESSES CONFIRM REID HAS BEEN POOLSIDE WITH FRIENDS FOR PAST 4 HOURS.**

The reporter’s voiceover was breathless, almost giddy. *""When asked about the rumors of naval maneuvers in the Indian Ocean, Mr. Reid simply laughed and quoted Shakespeare: 'Much ado about nothing.' He then ordered another round of mimosas for his table.""*

In the dark, windowless tomb of the Situation Room, President Whitmore watched the man who had just ended his presidency eat a pastry in the sun. The contrast was a physical blow. The sweat on Whitmore's back felt cold. The air in the room tasted of stale coffee and fear.

On the screen, Reid was bathed in light, untouchable, eating breakfast while the world burned around him, and that world loved him for it.

Whitmore slowly sat down.

""He was there the whole time,"" Vance whispered, the realization shattering him. ""He didn't even need to be in the room to beat us. He did it on autopilot.""

Whitmore didn't answer. He just watched the screen, where the God Emperor of the new world was wiping a crumb from his lip, having breakfast on top of the world.

**THE FATE OF TRIDENT**

The four remaining survivors of Red Squadron stacked up on the heavy blast door of the Control Center. Washington checked his weapon. He was bleeding from the ears, his vision blurred, but the mission was all that mattered.

He held up three fingers. Two. One.

*Breach.*

The strip charge blew the locking mechanism. A flashbang canister was tossed inside, turning the world white with a deafening *CRACK-THUMP*.

They flowed into the room like water, weapons snapping to corners, voices screaming the commands they had practiced a thousand times.

""US Military! Get down! Hands on your heads!""

""Clear left!""

""Clear right!""

""Status!""

Washington stood in the center of the room, his rifle raised. The ringing in his ears faded, replaced by the hum of cooling fans.

There was no one to arrest.

The room was pristine. No chairs. No coffee cups. No panic. Just rows of fake plastic server racks with blinking Christmas lights humming in the dark, and a single whiteboard in the center of the room.

It wasn't a command center. It was just a trap.

Washington walked to the whiteboard. A single message was hand-written in black marker:

**GAME OVER.**

*KA-CHUNK.*

The sound came from behind them. The blast door they had just breached slammed shut, driven by hydraulic rams that crushed the twisted metal of the lock like paper. Magnetic seals engaged with a hiss of finality.

""Door's sealed!"" Alpha Five yelled, throwing his shoulder against it. ""It won't budge!""

Then, the floor dropped.

The entire room lurched violently, knocking them off their feet. A massive mechanical *THUD* reverberated through the walls as heavy locking pins engaged on the exterior.

Gravity shifted. The room tilted forty-five degrees.

""We're moving!"" Washington screamed, grabbing a server rack for support. ""The whole damn building is moving!""

It wasn't a building.

Outside, in the dark, the ""Control Center"" module detached from its moorings. Enormous magnetic clamps seized it, lifting the two-ton structure and sliding it seamlessly onto the magnetic rail of the Ascendant.

Inside, the survivors of the world's most elite special forces unit were helpless as the G-forces hit them. They weren't soldiers anymore. They were cargo.

The module accelerated, rocketing upward into the night sky, carrying the last of the President's men toward a prison in high earth orbit.

Checkmate.

They were released a week after without a single word in the middle of Singapore, in a paper prison uniform, in the afternoon equatorial shower. They walked to the US Embassy, where the Press was waiting to eat them alive.

Now she has not contacted me for the past 3 weeks. I am not sure if i am already discarded. Following is the time line of the major milestones in our relationship. Please help me get clarity on where i stand. 


Day 0 - we meet on a coffee date

Week 2 - first dinner. She is enthusiastic. We text at a decent rate. She talked about a deep trauma she had in het previous relationship.

Week 4 - we keep going on great dates. Slow physical touch escalations ( in out culture we dont get physical until quite some time).

Week 6 - i start finding her texting rate is low

Week -7 - she texts me that she miss me and she feel safe and comfortable around me. I reply to her but she goes no contact for 3 days. Later come back as nothing happend

Week 9 - her texting even reduces. No reply for 3 days become more common. But we still meet and continue having great dates. Meetings go awesome as it was in the beginning. 


Week 12 - we had an intimate and romantic birthday celebration (her). I gave her some thought ful gifts and she reciprocated really well during our tome together.

Week 13 - from 2 days after the birthday she goes silent for a week. Later come back saying sorry she was not present. The reason was she was “busy”. She also said she will make up for it. I mentioned i really like her and want to connect even more at a more closer level ( i had no idea about what an fa means then).

Week 14 - she goes no contact and later comes back and says she cant be in a relationship now. She is scared of getting hurt again. After this she goes no contact

Week 18 - she comes back after 3 weeks of silence and says sorry she is absent and if i want to stop talking to her forever she will understand. I called out  her behavior . Then She says “i process things differently than you and i am scared of getting hurt again”. 

After this she again goes no contact and now its been 2 weeks.

When she goes no contact I never initiate or chase. She comes back after 2-3 weeks. What should i do? I really want to make this work. ",1,1767510169.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

But last week I was cleaning out his car and found a bunch of receipts from restaurants and coffee shops during times when he told me he was at the office. Like, receipts from 2pm on a Tuesday when he said he had back-to-back client meetings. And some of them are from places that are nowhere near his office. I haven't confronted him yet because I'm honestly of what I m find out. Part of me thinks maybe he's just taking longer lunch breaks than he admits to, or maybe meeting clients at these places? But another part of me is wondering if something else is going on. The thing that's really getting to me is that if he's lying about something as simple as where he eats lunch, what else m he be lying about? I've always trusted him completely and now I feel like I don't even know what's real anymore. I keep going back and forth between wanting to just ask him directly and wanting to do more invest first.

I’ll give you the most pressing examples of the kind of person I am: 



-  I threw a pill bottle at my 16m brother in the car when I was 18

When we were in the car we were frustrated with each other- then he started making fun of me for not being able to drive yet (I was in a car accident that totaled our car when I was 16- and due to my already preexisting mental illness and untreated adhd- it delayed me, although I do admit it is a bit silly that I was a grown adult not able to drive). Anyways I threw my pill bottle at him, hopped out of the car, flipped him off and went to school until I was sent to the hospital and spent a week in the ward because I stupidly told the teacher some stuff..when I got home… annnnddd wasted money..

-  I ran away for a brief period of time on a car trip.

I don’t know why I did this it’s really stupid immature and selfish- basically I talk my mouth off a lot and get obsessed with certain topics- like something I’m excited for. So in the car everyone got pretty pissed off at me- as family car trips go- they’d eventually snap- saying some not so pleasant but warranted things. “You’re annoying, this is why nobody likes you, you never just shut up, you ruin everything.” Coming from my mother, Brother, and a little from my father. So I hop out (the vehicle was in a short line), and I walk a ways until my father confronts me- I ask him if they’re still going to berate me- he calls me immature (which I was), and I (not wanting to be in the car again to be berated- choose to stay out for a while and wander the town.) They then drive off and pretend they are leaving me (So I wander and try to find a place to get information so I could find a place to stay like a roadside or something). Apparently they were just joking with me that they left me and were already an hour away- they had just gotten themselves lunch and went sightseeing. I kinda deserved that ngl. 

-  I punched my dad in the face. 

When we arrived at where we were staying my brother continued to say the previous things- so I got a little upset. Travel is generally hard on me (for unknown reasons)??- 
I started crying and freaking out (and idk what I was saying tbh I just started weeping and complaining.) 
I guess I was being too loud and my father grabbed me from behind and restrained my arms as a punishment- so I wiggled loose and attempted punching him in the face. I did but it was pretty light luckily. He threw me against the Tv (deservedly).

- I threw coffee on the ground in my house. 

I woke up one morning to my parents who made some plans I was not aware of- and I started telling them about why they wouldn’t work out and how I wished they asked me. They called me a brat and stuff. I started crying and telling them I wasn’t trying to be and that I appreciated them and that I wasn’t trying to interfere- But that it was their fault for not asking me ahead of time- and (understandably) my father yet again restrained me. I had a coffee cup in hand and I threw it at the floor and he grabbed me and threw me down a flight of stairs (lol). 

-   Flirted and almost got together with someone who was 16 when I was 19

Me and the same kid that I was talking about above started flirting and we even gave each other kisses on the cheek. I immediately asked their age when we started genuinely texting- but they just replied with “junior” and I was a senior- so my careless dumbass assumed we were not that far apart in age. It was until I figured out they were also consecutively dating a freshmen that I realized I may have misjudged the situation. I then asked for more specifics and had a serious conversation- and he told me he was 16. I was 18 turning 19 shortly- so I cut off the relationship- but I should have been less careless and gross. 

-  I actively encourage and aid my minor friends in illegal behavior.

We walk on the tracks and go under bridges. I bought all of us spraypaint and I help them steal Barb wire off of fences. One is 17, one is 15, and one is 14.

-  Basically I was 5 or 6.  I remember wrestling with a boy around my age (I think I genuinely dunno how old this kid was), and he started saying things about my gender and stuff, and how I was weak, and that women were stupid, and similar things alike. I did the same but replace women with Asian. He (rightfully) got upset and that’s when I realized what I did really effected him, so I apologized to him, but it doesn’t matter because I was still racist and what happened was awful. I got another post abt it.


- I’m a hoarder. Yeah just that. I keep everything other than the obvious gross stuff like napkins and used stuff. I can get rid of things, but I also can’t walk in the room i live in because I have so much.

- I’ve engaged in some crazy shit online from 15-18 years old. 

- I’m gay and that’s kind of a moral failing in my eyes. 

That’s the tame stuff I feel like I can get away with but if you need more of the worse stuff to make a decision lemme know. Be honest. ",1,1767509798.0,Life,14,0.6,False

Carissa sighed softly, “It… was just my luck back then.”

The truth was, she hadn’t completed her professional education at the Art University, no degree, no certificate. Her heart had shattered, and she felt as if her dreams had slipped through her fingers. That’s why she had quietly started sharing her art online, with no real expectation of fame or recognition. She chose to keep her identity a secret. To protect herself, she even bought new tablets and phones solely for her artwork, meticulously using VPNs and masking her IP address so that no one could ever trace the creations back to her.

But in reality, she had quietly risen to greatness, and even now, she had no intention of revealing herself. She had come simply like any other admirer of art, seeking a spark of inspiration. Yet unexpectedly, her long-hidden identity was unveiled in front of everyone, by none other than her old rival.

Lucien, “Blaming your luck for this? That’s a lame excuse.”

Carissa let out a bitter, sad smile. “You wouldn’t understand… you’ve already achieved everything, that’s why it’s beyond your knowledge.”

Lucien’s eyes softened with concern. “What’s going on? Are you struggling, financially, with relationships, or dealing with the loss of someone dear? Tell me… maybe I can help.”

“Why would you even want to help me?” Carissa asked, her voice tinged with suspicion. “You used to hate me, didn’t you?”

Lucien’s lips curved into a teasing smile. “Exactly. I did… but not anymore.”

Carissa gave him a sharp look, caught between disbelief and curiosity.

“Come on,” he chuckled, leaning slightly closer, “we were just kids back then. Are you seriously still holding a grudge?”

“And really, what grudge could I have had against you back in university? You were barely around for half a month anyway! Gone the rest of the time! Did I slip a cockroach into your lunch? Ruin your artwork? Or hide a mountain of lice in your long hair? Huh?”

Carissa threw up her hands in exasperation. “Gosh! How old are you now? Do these ridiculous ideas just randomly pop into your head?”

Lucien, “Don’t dodge the question. Tell me, would you… like to work with me?”

Carissa blinked, caught off guard. “What…? Did I hear that right?”

He smiled, unwavering. “You heard perfectly. I assume you’re still working as an independent artist. So, how about joining forces with me? Partner with me, and not only will one of your pieces be showcased at every exhibition I hold, but I’ll also make sure it reaches the biggest names in the art world and helps you sell them too.”

Carissa paused, pondering for a moment. “So… you mean, since you’ve become such a big artist, you’re offering me the chance to rise too? Is that what you’re saying?”

Lucien, “Aww… so you do admit I’ve grown into a big artist, and that you’ve been keeping an eye on me all this time. I like that.”

Carissa playfully tapped his shoulder. “Be honest! What’s with these sudden lines of yours?! What do you mean? What you want from me? ”

Just then Lucien confidently raised his paddle, signaling his bid for a artwork—a striking depiction of a male fire figure and a female water figure locked in a fiery kiss.

The background pulsed with heat, energy, and raw emotion. The passion of the kiss seemed to ignite like actual flames, with fire dancing across the woman’s lips. The water element flowed gracefully through the smooth lines of her face and the soft, golden waves of her hair. Meanwhile, the fire figure, clad in a vivid red suit, kissed with intense fervor, his energy meeting hers, while her hand rested gently on his shoulder, grounding the fiery embrace in a delicate balance of passion and fluidity.

The painting had already drawn countless bids, yet Lucien confidently raised the stakes to an astounding one billion, and claimed it as his own.

Glancing at Carissa, seated close by, his eyes locked with hers, he murmured with quiet intensity, “It’s you I want, nothing much.”






A little while later, the exhibition finally wrapped up. Carissa, drained from the day’s events, simply wanted to go straight home. But Lucien wasn’t about to let her slip away. With a confident insistence, he ushered her into his car, declaring he would drive her.

As they drove, old habits resurfaced, they bickered and teased each other just like in their university days, the playful tension filling the car.

Carissa kept protesting, insisting he had no right to make her ride with him and refusing even to give him directions to her home. 

Lucien leaned back in his seat, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Ah, I see,” he drawled, his lips curling. “So your plan is to spend the whole night here in my car with me? Well, I don’t mind that at all.”

Carissa shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass, realizing quickly that he had no intention of letting her go so easily. With an exasperated sigh, she finally gave in and muttered her address under her breath.

The moment he started driving, Lucien’s playful interrogation began. He asked about her life, her family, her work, his tone casual, yet his eyes intent, studying every flicker of expression on her face. 

Then, he said, “So… what about your love life? Anyone special these days?”

Carissa turned her face toward the window, refusing to answer, but Lucien only chuckled softly, the sound low and knowing, as if he could already read her silence.

Carissa had no intention of sharing anything personal, but Lucien was relentless. He kept nudging, teasing, and tossing playful questions her way until she finally sighed and gave in. Piece by piece, she did tell him a little about her life, just enough to keep him quiet.

In return, Lucien opened up too, his voice dipping into a softer tone as he spoke. He mentioned that he was still single, then, with that same effortless charm, added that even his family admired Carter’s work.

A small smile tugged at his lips as he glanced at her. “You know,” he said, “my family’s been praising your art for years. Next time, you have to meet them, they’d be over the moon to finally meet the artist they’ve been talking about nonstop.”

Before she could brace herself, they had arrived at her home. Carissa’s stomach twisted with worry, she was sure Lucien would find some way to tease her about her modest living.

But to her astonishment, he didn’t mock her at all. With a playful grin, he leaned back on his car and said, “Well, since I’ve come all this way… I think a cup of coffee is the least I deserve, don’t you think?”

Carissa said, “Listen, why are you being so clingy? Don’t tell me you plan to come inside and make fun of my home and my situation—”

Before she could finish, a familiar voice called from inside. Reluctantly, Carissa introduced Lucien to Madeline. 

“Oh! So this is Lucien,” she exclaimed. “I’ve heard so much about you,” she added, then glanced at Carissa with a teasing smile, “but you never said he was this handsome!”

Carissa shot a quick glance at her sister, and Lucien, chuckling as he caught her eye, said, “I’m glad you mentioned me, it seems I left quite a memorable impression.”

Eventually, they went inside for coffee, sharing light conversation along the way. But Carissa soon nudged him gently.

“That’s enough now. Go enjoy your coffee. We don’t usually let strangers linger this long.” 

By the time they settled in, Carissa had slipped back into her familiar self, hair tied up, in cozy pajamas, and glasses perched on her nose.

Madeline frowned, “Hey, don't be so rude—”

Lucien waved her off gently, smiling, “It’s alright.”

“Besides,” he continued, “after all the fuss and excitement today, everyone must be exhausted.”

Carissa gave Lucien a pointed look, and he nodding subtly to Madeline. 

She said to Carissa, “Go on, let your friend be.”

Carissa, “We are not friends.”

Madeline chimed in teasingly, “Then…couple?”

Carissa turned to her sister with an incredulous, almost wild look.

Lucien simply laughed at the scene. Then she walked him out outside and just as Carissa tried to walk away again inside, he caught her hand gently.

“Hey now! What’s this?”

Lucien said smoothly, “Consider this your gift.” With a small flourish, he retrieved the painting he had just won at the auction from his car.

Carissa stared, eyes wide. “Wait… what? You just bought this!”

He gave her a sincere smile. “Exactly… and it’s all yours.”

“Huh?” Carissa’s eyes widened in more disbelief. “Excuse me… what?”

“You… you bought this for me? For a billion dollars?!”

Lucien simply nodded. 

Carissa burst out laughing, shaking her head. “No way! I don’t want it!” She handed it back to him. “Here—take it! I’m no beggar! Give it to someone else, not me!”

“I know what this is,” Carissa snapped, crossing her arms. “You’re giving this to me as some kind of joke after seeing my house like this, right? Hmp! Arrogant! Full of pride and money, that’s all you care about?!”

Lucien stepped closer, his voice low and as he leaned toward her ear. “Arrogant? Me? That was back then… back when I planned on winning you over.”

Carissa took an embarrassed step back, flushing. “Wait… why are you whispering in my ear? Huh?” Her eyes darted around. 

Lucien smiled warmly, cradling the painting gently in his hands, his touch tender and careful.

“Carissa, I love you. Think of this as a small token of my feelings, a little confession wrapped up just for you.”

However, was disappointed in humanity after walking up and down the waterline, picking up rubbish. Rubbish through the shrubs, in the rocks and sand, smashed bottles hidden under rocks, rubbish in the water.

Also there were clothes, lots of broken glass everywhere, empty food and drink containers, takeaway coffee cups, fishing lines - some with hooks still attached, tent poles. Most the glass I managed to get in the empty popcorn container.

And the amount of Tweed Bait bags floating around the place! Plus a rotisserie chicken bag with its bones in it!

I don't care if you're a local, or visiting, but if you're the type of person that does this, do better. Do better for yourself and for future generations that follow in our footsteps. Do better for the wildlife on the land, in the water and in the skies!

I’m really looking forward to my trip next week, January 7 through January 12

My daughter(8) my husband and I are going.

I would like to preface this by saying that my daughter is not a simple adventures kid. She’s watched several documentaries about the Whitney plantation, loves all things spooky and deeply respects history.

She loves books, reading, and anything related to history and morbid things. She’s also so particularly interested in learning about the mysteries of New Orleans universe.

She’s been practicing her French and this trip was a surprise for her for Christmas.

We are staying at the Rubenstein hotel

We are def not renting a car— but need transportation for a few hours to get to the Whitney plantation. And maybe hit the other two on the same day.

Attached is my preparation so far I said it for daily activities, and I made it based on the proximity and Where, we will be in the area

My biggest questions here are:

1. For the Whitney plantation, is there any specific cabdriver or person who would be willing to work with me to drive me and my Family there and back for a fee of course!
2. Although I am aware of the spooky tours, I looked into each of them and I am at a bit of a loss because the ones that seem to be most attracting to my daughter seem to be adult only. I am looking for something deeply respectful of the occult history, and that would be OK with an eight year-old that is Incredibly interested in the learning deep rooted history of NOLA
3. Although we have saved up a bit for the trip, we are trying to be as mindful as possible with regard to our spending. We are prioritizing things she will want for our bigger purchases (she wants books, so we are going to visit quite a few bookstores) what locations would you particularly not recommend for overpriced food on my list?

We will be visiting the commanders Palace for lunch on Thursday as our special treat

4. Is there anything that’s not on here that you think she would love?

5. Since we are arriving and would be probably settled in around nine P.M. on a Wednesday. Is there any particular activities or locations that are open a little bit later in the evening that would allow children?

1q3j4w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q3j4w4/what_is_a_cracked_vpn_and_is_it_safe_to_use/,What is a Cracked VPN and is It Safe to Use?,"I've seen people get burned by cracked VPNs more times than I can count. The temptation is obvious—why pay for NordVPN when some sketchy forum promises the same thing for free? But here's what actually happens when you download that ""free premium VPN"": your device becomes a playground for hackers.

Cracked VPNs aren't just ineffective. They're actively dangerous. And I'm going to show you exactly why—plus legitimate ways to get VPN protection without gambling with your data.

>✅ **Quick Answer:** A cracked VPN is pirated software that's been illegally modified to bypass subscription fees. **They're extremely unsafe**—most contain malware designed to steal your data, and they completely defeat the purpose of using a VPN in the first place. The good news? Legitimate VPNs cost as little as **$2-3/month**, making cracked versions pointless.

# What Is a Cracked VPN? The Technical Reality

A cracked VPN is **pirated software that's been reverse-engineered** to remove licensing checks and subscription requirements. Hackers modify the legitimate VPN application's code to make it appear registered without actually paying the provider.

Think of it like someone picking the lock on a premium service. But unlike cracking a video game (which only affects the user), cracking a VPN fundamentally breaks the security model.

Here's what hackers actually do:

* **Strip out license verification code** so the app doesn't check for valid payment
* **Remove update mechanisms** to prevent the app from detecting it's been modified
* **Inject their own code** (this is where things get really nasty)
* **Bundle it with malware** that steals your data while you think you're protected

The irony? You're downloading a security tool that's been purposefully compromised by criminals.

# How Cracked VPNs Spread: The Distribution Network

You won't find cracked VPNs in legitimate app stores. Instead, they circulate through:

* **Torrent sites** (the same places where other pirated software lives)
* **Shady third-party app stores** with zero security vetting
* **Underground forums** where users trade ""cracks""
* **Suspicious download sites** that promise ""free premium VPN""
* **Dark web marketplaces** (yes, it gets that sketchy)

These sources have **zero accountability**. There's no one verifying the software is actually what it claims to be. And criminals know this—which is why they use these channels to distribute malware disguised as useful tools.

When you download a cracked VPN, you're essentially trusting random strangers on the internet to give you security software. Sound smart to you?

# The Real Dangers: What You're Actually Installing

Let me be blunt—cracked VPNs are malware delivery systems with a VPN interface slapped on top. Here's what independent security researchers have found inside these ""free"" tools:

# Hidden Malware and Data Theft

Cracked VPNs frequently contain Trojans, spyware, and adware embedded directly in the code. The moment you install the software, hackers gain backdoor access to your device.

What they can steal:

* **Banking credentials and credit card numbers**
* **Passwords for all your accounts** (email, social media, work)
* **Personal communications** (messages, emails, browsing history)
* **Identity documents** if you've stored them digitally
* **Cryptocurrency wallets** (a favorite target)

Recent malware campaigns have used fake VPN installers to spread info-stealers like Lumma and ACR, which are designed specifically to harvest credentials and financial data.

# Zero Actual Security

A VPN's entire purpose is encryption. But cracked VPNs often:

* **Use broken or outdated encryption** with known vulnerabilities
* **Don't encrypt traffic at all** despite claiming to do so
* **Leak your real IP address** (defeating the whole point)
* **Expose DNS queries** so your ISP still sees what you're doing

Cracked VPNs may use less secure encryption protocols than legitimate versions and could contain altered code that makes your data more vulnerable to hackers.

You end up with the **worst of both worlds**: no privacy protection plus active malware on your device.

# The ""Free"" Service That Sells You

Here's a dirty secret—many pirated VPN builds inject ads, trackers, or monetization schemes beyond the malware itself. You're not getting a free service. You're becoming the product.

These fake VPNs:

* **Log every website you visit** and sell that data
* **Inject advertising** into the pages you browse
* **Run subscription scams** that charge hidden fees
* **Mine cryptocurrency** using your device's processing power

# Performance That Makes You Regret Everything

Even if you somehow avoid the malware (unlikely), cracked VPNs are still terrible:

|Issue|Why It Happens|
|:-|:-|
|**Constant disconnections**|Broken code doesn't maintain stable connections|
|**Glacially slow speeds**|Limited or congested servers (if they work at all)|
|**Missing features**|Kill switches and DNS protection get stripped out|
|**No updates**|Security vulnerabilities never get patched|
|**Limited servers**|Most location options simply don't work|

Cracked VPNs can be unstable with frequent connection drops, leaving you more vulnerable online.

Want to stream Netflix? Good luck. Need it for work? Forget about it. Trying to torrent safely? You're exposing your IP to everyone.

# Legal Risks You Probably Didn't Consider

Using pirated software is illegal in most countries. Period.

In some regions, distributing and using cracked software may be a civil or criminal offense resulting in fines or other legal penalties. If copyright holders decide to pursue action, you could face:

* **Substantial fines** (thousands of dollars)
* **Legal fees** defending yourself
* **Criminal charges** in some jurisdictions
* **ISP warnings** or service termination

And here's the kicker—using a cracked VPN also breaches the provider's terms of service, which could lead to additional legal complications if they decide to pursue action.

# No Support When Things Go Wrong

Let's say your cracked VPN starts malfunctioning (it will). Or you discover it's been leaking your data (probably is). Or you need help configuring it. Who do you call?

**Nobody.**

Legitimate paid VPN services provide access to customer support teams to help resolve technical issues. Cracked VPNs don't provide this support—if you run into a problem, you're on your own.

You can't email support. You can't open a ticket. You can't even leave a review warning others. You're completely on your own with compromised software on your device.

>⚠️ **Warning:** I've personally helped friends recover from cracked VPN infections. The damage repair—professional malware removal, identity theft monitoring, new credit cards—cost more than **5 years** of legitimate VPN service. That ""free"" VPN ended up being the most expensive software they never bought.

# The Complete Risk Breakdown

Here's everything you're gambling with when you download a cracked VPN:

|Risk Category|Specific Threats|Likelihood|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Malware Infection**|Trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware|Very High|
|**Data Theft**|Passwords, financial info, personal communications|Very High|
|**Privacy Loss**|IP leaks, DNS leaks, traffic logging|Extremely High|
|**Identity Theft**|Stolen credentials used to impersonate you|High|
|**Financial Loss**|Stolen banking details, credit card fraud|High|
|**Legal Trouble**|Copyright infringement fines, criminal charges|Medium|
|**Device Damage**|System instability, performance degradation|High|
|**No Support**|Zero help when things go wrong|Guaranteed|

# Why People Turn to Cracked VPNs (And Why It's Unnecessary)

I get it. VPN subscriptions seem expensive when you're comparing them to ""free."" But this is faulty logic for two reasons:

**First**, legitimate VPNs are cheaper than you think. We're not talking about $20/month anymore. Premium services have drastically cut prices to compete.

**Second**, the ""cost"" of a cracked VPN—malware removal, identity theft recovery, lost data—makes it the most expensive option by far.

Let's look at what legitimate VPNs actually cost:

|VPN Provider|Monthly Plan|2-Year Plan|Cost Per Month|Features|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Surfshark**|$15.45|$53.73 (27 months)|**$1.99**|Unlimited devices, 4,500+ servers, CleanWeb ad-blocking 🏆|
|**NordVPN**|$12.99|$80.73 (27 months)|**$2.99**|8,800+ servers, NordLynx protocol, Threat Protection|
|**Private Internet Access**|Higher|\~$54 (3 years)|**$2.03**|Unlimited devices, strong P2P support|
|**PrivadoVPN**|Higher|\~$30 (2 years)|**$1.11**|Most affordable option, unlimited connections|

**Think about this:** Surfshark costs **$1.99/month**. That's less than a coffee. Less than a single streaming rental. Less than parking for an hour.

For the price of **one lunch per month**, you get:

* Actual working encryption
* Legitimate 24/7 customer support
* Regular security updates
* No malware (obviously)
* A company that's legally accountable for protecting your data

The ""savings"" from a cracked VPN disappear the moment you factor in the risks.

>💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Don't want to commit to 2 years? Almost every legitimate VPN offers a **30-day money-back guarantee**. Try NordVPN or Surfshark for a month, and if you hate it, get your money back. That's essentially a free month without the malware risk.

# How to Spot a Fake or Cracked VPN

Before you download ANY VPN, run through this checklist. If you see these red flags, **run**:

# Obvious Warning Signs

**🚩 Third-party download sites**  
Legitimate VPNs are only available through official app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) or the provider's website. If someone offers a premium VPN on a third-party site or forum at a cheap price or for free, it's most likely pirated.

**🚩 ""Free premium features""**  
Real VPN companies don't give away their paid tiers for free. If it sounds too good to be true, it's malware with a VPN label.

**🚩 Suspicious file names**  
Files like ""NordVPN\_Cracked.exe"" or ""ExpressVPN\_Full\_Version\_Free.apk"" are **obvious** malware. Don't be fooled by the branding.

**🚩 Requests for excessive permissions**  
If a VPN app wants access to your camera, microphone, contacts, and SMS messages, it's not a VPN—it's spyware.

**🚩 No official website or support**  
Can't find contact information? No customer support email? That's because it's not a real company.

**🚩 Browser/antivirus warnings**  
When your browser or security software throws up a red flag about a download, **listen to it**. Those warnings exist for a reason.

# The ""Too Cheap"" Scam

Some scammers sell ""premium VPN accounts"" at suspiciously low prices—like a year of ExpressVPN for $10. These are either:

1. **Stolen accounts** from hacked users (which means the seller can see your data)
2. **Account sharing services** that violate terms of service
3. **Completely fake** accounts that stop working after payment

Unscrupulous online providers sell premium VPN subscriptions at low prices, but these are just VPN accounts stolen from users with weak passwords—meaning the people who sell them can view your information.

# The Smart Alternative: Legitimate Affordable VPNs

Want a VPN without breaking the bank? Here are your **actually safe** options, ranked by value:

# Option 1: Budget Premium VPNs (Recommended)

These providers offer legitimate premium features at rock-bottom prices:

**Surfshark** — **$1.99/month** (2-year plan)

* Unlimited simultaneous connections (protect every device you own)
* 4,500+ servers in 100 countries
* CleanWeb blocks ads and malware
* 30-day money-back guarantee
* Works with Netflix, torrenting, everything

This is my top recommendation. Surfshark represents exceptional value at $1.99/month on its 2-year Starter plan, delivering performance that rivals VPNs costing 5x more.

**NordVPN** — **$2.99/month** (2-year plan)

* 8,800+ servers in 129 countries
* NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard—blazing fast)
* Threat Protection blocks malware and trackers
* Independently audited no-logs policy
* 10 simultaneous connections

Worth the extra dollar if you want the fastest speeds and largest server network. NordVPN ranks #1 in best VPN services and is great value at $2.99/month.

**Private Internet Access** — **$2.03/month** (3-year plan)

* Unlimited devices
* 35,000+ servers
* Excellent for torrenting
* Open-source apps (you can verify the code yourself)

# Option 2: Reputable Free VPNs (With Limitations)

Not ready to pay anything? These free options are **actually safe**, unlike cracked VPNs:

**ProtonVPN Free**

* No bandwidth limits (unlike most free VPNs)
* Strong encryption
* No-logs policy
* **Limitations:** Only 3 server locations, slower speeds

**Windscribe Free**

* 10GB/month data
* Good privacy practices
* **Limitations:** Data cap, limited servers

>💡 **Pro Tip:** Free VPNs are fine for occasional use, but they have significant limitations. If you're using a VPN daily, the $2-3/month for a premium service is absolutely worth it. That's the cost of one coffee, and you get unlimited everything.

# Option 3: VPN Free Trials (Test Before Buying)

Want to try premium features risk-free? Use these trial periods:

* **NordVPN:** 30-day money-back guarantee (essentially a 30-day trial)
* **Surfshark:** 7-day free trial + 30-day money-back guarantee
* **ExpressVPN:** 30-day money-back guarantee

Sign up, test it thoroughly, and request a refund if it doesn't work for you. I've done this multiple times with zero hassle.

# What Makes a VPN Actually Worth Paying For?

When you pay for a legitimate VPN, here's what you're getting that cracked versions **cannot** provide:

✅ **Real encryption** — Your data is actually protected, not just pretending to be  
✅ **Verified no-logs policy** — Independent audits prove they're not storing your data  
✅ **Regular security updates** — Patches for new vulnerabilities get applied automatically  
✅ **Working kill switch** — Internet cuts off if VPN drops, preventing IP leaks  
✅ **DNS leak protection** — Your ISP can't see what you're doing  
✅ **Customer support** — Real humans who can solve problems  
✅ **Legal accountability** — The company can be sued if they violate your privacy  
✅ **Streaming support** — Actually works with Netflix, Disney+, etc.  
✅ **Fast speeds** — Servers aren't congested or broken  
✅ **Multiple device protection** — Use it on phone, laptop, tablet simultaneously

A cracked VPN offers **zero** of these benefits. Not one.

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** You're not paying for the software—you're paying for security, privacy, and infrastructure. Trying to skip that payment by using a crack is like buying a safe with a broken lock. It defeats the entire purpose.

# The Verdict: Are Cracked VPNs Ever Worth It?

**Absolutely not.**

I've tested VPNs for years, and I can tell you with complete certainty: cracked VPNs are **worse than having no VPN at all**. At least without a VPN, you know your connection isn't secure. With a cracked VPN, you have a **false sense of security** while hackers actively steal your data.

Here's the math that should settle this:

* **Cracked VPN:** $0 upfront + malware removal ($100-500) + potential identity theft ($1,000+) + legal risk + zero privacy = **Terrible deal**
* **Legitimate VPN:** $2-3/month + actual security + working features + legal protection + customer support = **Obvious choice**

The ""free"" option isn't free. It's just expensive in ways you don't see until it's too late.

# What You Should Do Instead

If you need a VPN but money's tight:

1. **Try a free trial** — Test NordVPN or Surfshark for free with their money-back guarantees
2. **Use a reputable free VPN** — ProtonVPN's free tier is safe (just limited)
3. **Wait for a sale** — VPN providers run constant promotions
4. **Pay for one month** — Even $12.99 for one month of real protection beats $0 for malware

What you **shouldn't** do is gamble with your data by downloading sketchy software from shady websites. The risk-to-reward ratio is completely upside down.

# My Personal Recommendation

After years of testing, I recommend **Surfshark** for most people. At $1.99/month, it's barely more expensive than the data you'd lose from a single identity theft incident. Plus, unlimited device connections mean your whole family gets protected for less than the cost of a Netflix subscription.

Not ready to commit? **Try the 7-day free trial**, test it out, and see if it works for you. If you don't like it, request a refund within 30 days. No risk, actual security.

The alternative—downloading a cracked VPN—guarantees you'll end up with malware, zero privacy, and potential legal trouble. That's not a gamble worth taking.",1,1767509647.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False
1q3j44z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3j44z,Skincare Advise pls,"Hey guys, I'm a 27-year-old male and fairly new to skincare. Over the past few months, I've tried to understand what products suit my skin by reading and experimenting a bit, and based on that, I ended up with the products I'm currently using.

My skin condition: my skin is mostly clear. I have just a very slight hint of dark circles nothing too noticeable unless you really look for it. I've also realized that my skin is on the drier side, because when I wake up in the morning, it doesn't feel oily at all and often feels dry.

Since I'm still learning, I wanted feedback from the community. I'm not sure if I'm overdoing anything or using products that I might not actually need but bought anyway.

I'd love suggestions on:

1. Whether any product in my routine is unnecessary

2. If there are better or more effective replacements Or if my routine can be simplified for my skin type

I've listed the products I'm currently using below. Looking forward to your suggestions and learning more. Thanks!

I’ll give you the most pressing examples of the kind of person I am: 



-  I threw a pill bottle at my 16m brother in the car when I was 18

When we were in the car we were frustrated with each other- then he started making fun of me for not being able to drive yet (I was in a car accident that totaled our car when I was 16- and due to my already preexisting mental illness and untreated adhd- it delayed me, although I do admit it is a bit silly that I was a grown adult not able to drive). Anyways I threw my pill bottle at him, hopped out of the car, flipped him off and went to school until I was sent to the hospital and spent a week in the ward because I stupidly told the teacher some stuff..when I got home… annnnddd wasted money..

-  I ran away for a brief period of time on a car trip.

I don’t know why I did this it’s really stupid immature and selfish- basically I talk my mouth off a lot and get obsessed with certain topics- like something I’m excited for. So in the car everyone got pretty pissed off at me- as family car trips go- they’d eventually snap- saying some not so pleasant but warranted things. “You’re annoying, this is why nobody likes you, you never just shut up, you ruin everything.” Coming from my mother, Brother, and a little from my father. So I hop out (the vehicle was in a short line), and I walk a ways until my father confronts me- I ask him if they’re still going to berate me- he calls me immature (which I was), and I (not wanting to be in the car again to be berated- choose to stay out for a while and wander the town.) They then drive off and pretend they are leaving me (So I wander and try to find a place to get information so I could find a place to stay like a roadside or something). Apparently they were just joking with me that they left me and were already an hour away- they had just gotten themselves lunch and went sightseeing. I kinda deserved that ngl. 

-  I punched my dad in the face. 

When we arrived at where we were staying my brother continued to say the previous things- so I got a little upset. Travel is generally hard on me (for unknown reasons)??- 
I started crying and freaking out (and idk what I was saying tbh I just started weeping and complaining.) 
I guess I was being too loud and my father grabbed me from behind and restrained my arms as a punishment- so I wiggled loose and attempted punching him in the face. I did but it was pretty light luckily. He threw me against the Tv (deservedly).

- I threw coffee on the ground in my house. 

I woke up one morning to my parents who made some plans I was not aware of- and I started telling them about why they wouldn’t work out and how I wished they asked me. They called me a brat and stuff. I started crying and telling them I wasn’t trying to be and that I appreciated them and that I wasn’t trying to interfere- But that it was their fault for not asking me ahead of time- and (understandably) my father yet again restrained me. I had a coffee cup in hand and I threw it at the floor and he grabbed me and threw me down a flight of stairs (lol). 

-   Flirted and almost got together with someone who was 16 when I was 19

Me and the same kid that I was talking about above started flirting and we even gave each other kisses on the cheek. I immediately asked their age when we started genuinely texting- but they just replied with “junior” and I was a senior- so my careless dumbass assumed we were not that far apart in age. It was until I figured out they were also consecutively dating a freshmen that I realized I may have misjudged the situation. I then asked for more specifics and had a serious conversation- and he told me he was 16. I was 18 turning 19 shortly- so I cut off the relationship- but I should have been less careless and gross. 

-  I actively encourage and aid my minor friends in illegal behavior.

We walk on the tracks and go under bridges. I bought all of us spraypaint and I help them steal Barb wire off of fences. One is 17, one is 15, and one is 14.

-  Basically I was 5 or 6.  I remember wrestling with a boy around my age (I think I genuinely dunno how old this kid was), and he started saying things about my gender and stuff, and how I was weak, and that women were stupid, and similar things alike. I did the same but replace women with Asian. He (rightfully) got upset and that’s when I realized what I did really effected him, so I apologized to him, but it doesn’t matter because I was still racist and what happened was awful. I got another post abt it.


- I’m a hoarder. Yeah just that. I keep everything other than the obvious gross stuff like napkins and used stuff. I can get rid of things, but I also can’t walk in the room i live in because I have so much.

- I’ve engaged in some crazy shit online from 15-18 years old. 

- I’m gay and that’s kind of a moral failing in my eyes. 

That’s the tame stuff I feel like I can get away with but if you need more of the worse stuff to make a decision lemme know. Be honest. ",0,1767509443.0,LifeAdvice,4,0.5,False

Day one of our plant festival. Mr. Shriner hired some teenager to watch the shop this weekend so I could do the kettle corn stand. However, I feel like it makes more sense to hire the kid for the kettle corn and leave me to my air conditioned shop. Safe to say, not into it but whatever. 

So, I dressed myself in as much linen as possible, gave Demeter some extra kibble and headed out the door early to set up. Because Mr. Shriner is a traditionalist, I had to load 2 huge copper kettles into the truck of my car and hope my strap job stopped them from bouncing out. When I pulled in, Markus and Cami were just starting to unpack their car as well so we chatted for a moment. 

Cami makes the crystal sun catchers remember? Her table is always some form of divination, but she switches it up every year. This year, she went with palm reading and pendulums.

I don’t think I’ve introduced you to Markus yet. He’s a younger guy, works at the elementary school as the gym teacher. He does the muscle work for the fair. Setting up tables and booths, moving stock, all the things you’d expect from a young buff meathead. I say that with love of course, but he’s closer to being a camp counselor kind of man then your stereotypical jarhead gym teacher. 

I helped Cami pop up her booth while Markus McMuscles moved the kettles to my stall for me. By the time he came back, Cami was set up, and Markus and I were all soaked in sweat. I said my goodbyes and tootled off to finish unpacking. 

After several trips to the car, I got everything to my booth, started to put it away, heat up my kettles all the fun stuff.. So I get the gas going and turn around to set out my kernels and my flavors, and I managed to only grab what I needed for caramel, not Jed Mei’s snow. I still don’t have a clue where that comes from or what flavor it is. Maybe it’s white like snow?  If we would have stuck with caramel and cinnamon-caramel, this wouldn’t be an issue but I digress. So day one is only gonna be caramel flavored. 

Things went really well for a few hours. The mayor did her speech to open the festival, and the rides all started in a jarring scream of calliope and neon lights. Kids came up with their pocket money or their parents credit cards and walked away with bags of kettlecorn as big as they are. I seen some happy customers leave Cami’s tent, and even Rooter showed up for a few minutes. He stopped in and bought a bag to take to Sara and Loretta before heading to the cemetery. 

Then things went weird. oooOOOooo. Realistically, I think it was heat stroke. It’s August. 

So the festival is set up in the center of town, in a large paved plaza. In the middle of the plaza is a huge statue that’s been here since the town was founded. Not of the founder, like the one in the simpsons’ mind you. It’s a carving of a huge tree with the front of it missing. Kinda like a doorway you know? There’s a figure standing in that doorway, wearing long robes covered in leaves and a mask that looks kinda like this little tree guys from legend of Zelda, with a little branch kicking off the side and everything. 

Karen and her husband were selling her oils across the plaza from me. I could see their table, and they didn’t have a gazebo or anything to keep the sun off of them. Her husband has been steadily sipping tall boys all morning, so he was at the very least buzzed. Karen was putting drops of some oil in every time he looked away from a new can. What was she putting in their coffee last week? Jamsonweed for mental clarity or something? I don’t think that’s going to negate the whole pounding beer all morning but whatever. 

By noon, he had finished a six pack, and I didn’t see him drink anything else. So Ralph is sitting there, mildly buzzed and listening to his wife chatter when his eyes begin to bulge out of his head. He starts to mumble, trying to get his wife’s attention as he pushes back in his camping chair. Karen; in the midst of an ever important sale, ignores him until he goes “ass over teacups” as my mom says. Ralph flipped backwards in his chair, throwing his beer away from him in the process. He lands flat on his back, and keeps trying to push himself away, pointing at something in front of the table. Karen finally gives him attention, and tries to help him off the ground but he kept pushing her away, trying to crawl away until he backed himself against a tree. A few people rushed over to him, so my view was blocked but I could hear him start screaming. Something about redemption and reclamation of what is owed. Someone called an ambulance as soon as he started to vomit a black gooey stuff and started seizing. They rolled him on his side, and someone held Karen out of the way. Bless her, she was so scared. 

It didn’t take long for the ambulance arrive thankfully, and they were both loaded in and taken away before he got worse. He hadn’t drank or ate anything but beer for hours, sitting in the hot August sun, so it’s not terribly surprising he got so sick so quick. I hope he feels better soon though.

 Cami and I packed up Karen’s table for her and put it in her car. I scribbled out a note saying I had her keys and her purse and to call me when she’s ready for them, but if I don’t hear back tomorrow I’ll give a call. 

The rest of the day went well beyond a weird vibe hanging in the air. I sold out on corn about an hour before anticipated, so I took a stroll around the other booths before I packed up. Ended up buying a new toy for Demeter and a cute cigar band ring for myself. It looks kind of like Rooter’s now that I look at it.  But the carving is an eye with a lil flame in it and the stone is a transparent orange instead of a deep green tree. It almost glows, isn’t that neat? 

**Sunday, August 3rd, 2:39 am** 

Is heat stroke contagious? Can heat stroke cause mass hysteria? Today was fucking nuts. I don’t know what happened but I lost my mind again. A lot of us did. 

So I got up, got ready and left at the same time as yesterday, but I remembered Mr. Mei’s special blend this time. I even grabbed an extra bag of corn since I sold out early yesterday. Karen’s booth is gone when I arrived and someone else took her spot selling custom tumblers and those 3D printed dragons. Her car was gone too, but I still had her keys so she must have parked in a bad spot and got towed. I heard her husband was still hospitalized, so she’s probably not too concerned yet. 

So, rinse and repeat of the process yesterday. I start to heat the kettle, unpack my supplies, say hi to Cami (who brought me a saffron latte. I could kiss that woman) and Markus, and start popping corn. I did up a batch of caramel first and bagged that, hanging it on the hooks by the window. Then I popped open the cartons of Jeb Mei’s snow and my entire field of vision is covered in this tacky, off white powder that smells like… composting plants is the closest I can get you. It was absolutely disgusting and stuck to everything it touched. So I get that batch going and try to wipe everything clean but the powder just kind of transfers to my gloves so I keep having to change them. I blow through a pile of gloves in five minutes, but I did manage to get things cleaned up. So I bag up our mystery flavor, and hang that up in my windows for display.. Things are ok, maybe a bit warmer than I would have liked. I start selling bags of both flavors, things are great.

 I sell out of the first batch and start on the second when my hands start to tremble a little. Ok, it’s hot, so I start chugging my water and get back to work. Across the plaza, I hear a rattling scream. Then another, another, and another. When I look up, there’s several small pockets of people on their knees, screaming and collapsing to the ground, frothing at the mouth or gawking at the heavens above. Their friends watch in horror as they writhe around. 

I glance over at Cami, and she’s on her knees, her face raised to the sky, just like everyone else. I try to rush over to her in case she starts to seize too but my legs won’t let me move. I drop down just like everyone else, staring up to what should be clouds, but instead is the greasy ceiling of my booth. 

Cami starts to shriek, joining the horrid harmony of the poor other souls. 

Being on the floor, I can’t exactly see anything even if my legs would move but I feel like I can hear everything around me. 

The screaming starts to turn into a droning hum as people congregate in the center of the plaza around the big statue. They sort of congeal around it and their sound begins to change from that communal drone to speaking in tongues and begging for redemption. 

My legs start to twitch under me, as if they have a mind of their own. I start to stand, being pulled to the statue myself. As I approach it, I feel the air vibrate, pulling me closer to it, until I’m trying to push myself through the masses at the marble base to touch it and praise *her*. Cami is on my left, a shambling mess covered in…. Soot? Why does she have soot bleeding out of her nose? They all do.  I jerk my head down to see the front of my shirt covered in soot and ash. We all do. A spark climbs up my spine, jerking my head back up towards the statue. I meet her eye, and begin to beg. I didn’t know the statue was a woman, but she felt like a benevolent soul I must appease. 

The tone of our congregation suddenly shifts, and people are pulling each other out of the way, trying to touch it. I watch my own hands grab the collar of the woman in front of me and pull her to the ground. She sells earrings a few booths from Karen. I quickly take her spot, leaving her lying on the ground in this undulating mass of limbs and soot. 

Someone pushes up behind me and I hear a sharp crack before the woman releases a feral scream that quickly peters out. We don’t care. No one stops to help her. We’re fighting for the right to touch the base of this weird statue. 

As soon as my fingers graced the marble base, a surge of power that felt ancient and earthy launched up my arms and sends me into a frenzy. We clammer back into the crowd, letting the people behind us get a taste if they can manage to stay upright. If they fall, they’re underfoot and probably stepped on. With no control over my body, I rush for the nearest structure and begin to claw at the siding, trying to tear it apart with my bare hands. I think it was an enclosed gazebo where teenagers hid in to smoke pot at night. The wood planks had that plant smoke smell embedded in them and it felt like an offense to her. I don’t even know who she is but I needed to please her. I keep tearing at the boards until something becomes loose and falls to the ground then I move to the next one, this dryadic power telling me to destroy the structure because it’s an offense to *her* and what she’s provided for the town. I hear someone next to me, trying to do the same to appease her and win *her* favor. My body begins to grow heavy and slow at this point, and I think I blacked out. 

When I came around again, it was dark outside. The streetlights had come on, and the entire plaza was absolutely destroyed except the statue. Booths and tables had been flipped, the gazebo was missing boards and covered in dark wet streaks. Something had been on fire at one point, but now it was just a pile of smoldering ashes, the smoke hanging in the air. Hopefully unconscious bodies are scattered around, some twitching a little and some totally still. The woman I had pulled down is still in a crumpled pile at the base of the statue, and I couldn’t bring myself to go see if she’d alive or not. 

I pushed myself to my feet again and try to stay upright but my entire body feels like it’s on fire. My fingertips feel raw, I’m down at least one finger nail and maybe a few fingerprints entirely. I all but crawl to my car and climb in, patting around for my keys. Despite the utter chaos of the day, my keys never fell off my belt. This is why we have carabiners people. I crept home, grossly under the speed limit until I pulled into the back of the shop. I drug myself upstairs and crashed on my couch with Demeter on my chest for a few hours. 

I just woke up again, and I needed to write this down. This entire day was fucking crazy and I don’t know what happened but I’m not the only one that lost my mind. Enough people went nuts and caused destruction, we hurt people and someone started fires. The plaza was an absolute mess and I have no idea what caused it. I don’t know why we wanted to touch the statue. I don’t know who she is. I’m scared.  I’m going back to bed. 

**Sunday, August 3rd, 9:48 am**

The festival is canceled. But not from the mass hysteria or anything. There’s now an open investigation for embezzlement on the planning committee. And get this… The plaza is totally untouched. The gazebo is fine. No scorched piles of something. No people laying in the grass. All the ash and soot and everything is gone and sparking clean. But I’m still missing a goddamn nail. I don’t know what’s happening. ",1,1767509252.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,0.67,False

Motivational pa nga minsan.

Pero sa totoong buhay ng maraming Pilipino,  
**madalas hindi siya angkop sa mga sitwasyon.**

## The hidden assumption behind “magtipid ka lang”

May extra ka raw na puwedeng bawasan.

Pero kung around ₱13-20k ang take-home mo:

• Fixed na ang ambag sa bahay  
• Fixed ang pamasahe  
• Fixed ang pagkain (na minsan kulang pa)  
• Load/data
• Madalas may sinusuportahan pa  

So alin ang tatanggalin?  
Renta? Pagkain? Pamasahe?

## The problem isn’t discipline. It’s math.

Hindi ka “gastador.”  
Wala ka lang margin.

Kaya:

• Cutting coffee doesn’t magically create savings  
• Extreme tipid leads to burnout, not progress  
• Budget guilt replaces actual solutions  

See? You can’t optimize what’s already at survival level.

## What actually helps (for people with tight income)

Still – not perfect advice:

• Kahit ₱100–₱500 lang, basta consistent  
• Iwas muna sa bagong utang 
• Focus on stability, hindi financial heroism  
• Stop treating survival spending as failure  

Savings is not about being disciplined.  
It’s about having **room to breathe**.

## If you’ve been told “magtipid ka lang” before —

Did it really help?  
Or did something else actually move the needle for you?",10,1767509039.0,FinancialLiteracyPH,3,0.82,False

Look, we need to talk about the 3 PM slump. For me, it wasn’t just a slump; it was a daily crash-and-burn. Every single afternoon, my brain would just... check out. It was like a thick fog rolled in, making simple tasks feel impossible. My focus was shot, my memory was trash, and honestly, it was starting to affect my work.

I tried everything. I was chugging so much coffee I basically had a constant case of the jitters. I tried meditation, but let's be real, I couldn't stick with it for more than three days. My brain is too loud to just sit there in silence.
Then I stumbled across ""The Brain Song"" during a late-night doomscroll. My first thought? ""Honestly? This is pure pseudoscience and snake oil."" But two things caught my eye: a one-time price of $39 (no subscription!) and a 90-day money-back guarantee. For 30 days, I’d be a human guinea pig.
My 30-Day Experience:

Week 1: Ngl, I Thought I Wasted My Money. I felt nothing. Literally nothing. If anything, I was a little annoyed. The track isn't music; it's this weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape. The first few days, I just kept checking the clock. I was this close to quitting.

Week 2: Okay, Wait a Second... The Shift. This is when I started noticing something. The 3 PM slump wasn’t hitting me like a truck anymore; it was more like a gentle slope. And my memory recall felt... less effortful. You know that feeling when a name is on the tip of your tongue? That happened less.
Week 3 & 4: By the end of the month, the effects were much more noticeable. The best way I can describe it is clarity and flow. I still get distracted, but I could snap back to what I was doing way faster. The mental ""fog"" that used to cloud my afternoons felt noticeably thinner.

The Good and The Bad: It's low-effort and there is no subscription BS. But, it's a slow burn. It took me a solid two weeks to notice anything at all. Also, the marketing is kinda cringe. The sales process can be a trip with false urgency timers and unskippable upsell videos.

Final Take: The Brain Song is NOT a miracle cure. It's not going to turn you into a super-genius overnight. But it is a subtle but legit tool for improving mental clarity and focus. For me, that alone was worth it.

I’m Karen Casper, co-founder of **Behavior Technologies LLC**. Usually, I’m working on complex AI stuff (like our TokCore project), but sometimes I just need to make something silly that scratches a very specific itch.

**The Pet Peeve:** Does anyone else get irrationally annoyed when YouTubers or streamers say, *""See you next time""*? I’m sitting there thinking, ""No... you won't. You can't see me. That is physically impossible.""

**The Product:** So, I made the **Literal Sign-Off Mug**.

It’s designed to be a little chaotic for your morning coffee routine.

* **The Front:** Features a giant eye graphic with the text: *""I'll see you next time...""*.
* **The Back:** Flips the script and roasts the concept with: *""Well, I can’t really see you, so I guess I won’t… Bye!""*.

It’s basically ""main character energy"" in ceramic form. I love using it to troll my husband (and co-founder) Joseph or just to have a laugh at the absurdity of internet interactions.

**Where to find it:** If you want to embrace your own chaotic internet persona, you can grab one here:[**https://www.behaviortechnologiesllc.org/**](https://www.behaviortechnologiesllc.org/)

1) Your a overly wealthy asshat  taking vacations to places like “marthas vineyard” You have absolutely no connection to the reality of the average “commoner” you have a butler and go to parties where you only invite other rich asshats and talk about sailing and how people are lazy now and thats why they are poor
2) you are a non productive member of society, no this is not just homeless people or men living in their moms basement at 40, lots of you have jobs, they just dont do anything of real value, they are not necessary for the toliets to flush or the lights to come on, maybe you work in corporate pushing paper and sending memos, you might pour coffee at a certain location that had a pagan logo, maybe your a professional protester with blue hair idk but you guys sure do have opinions about everything and they are strong! and definitely right weather its the drop out saying fuck the system or the blue hair screaming my body my choice doesn’t matter I promise you could stop going to work forever and the power plants would still work, the water treatment plant would still run, military would still be on patrol… you could vanish and the only ones who would notice are your fake friends on social media
3) vampires parasites and leaches theres some overlap here with group 1)&2) but this is something different this goes from your incompetent criminal bankers who failed in 2008 and the criminal moron politicians rewarded. them 700 billion dollars, to your purse snatchers knocking out old ladies stupid punks attacking people in public for views retail theft rings in cali politicians in cali basically everyone in california theres just criminals and victims left there, when politicians have apps that follow their stock trades  people in your state are morons and odds are you are one of them, even your toxic dmv lady sucking the life outa making you fill out forms and throwing shade at you for no reason while she helps the government rob you by forcing you to buy an enhanced license 
4)The people that do all the actual work, linemen, plant operators, truck drivers, farmers, trades people, small businesses owners , garbage men, railroaders, roughnecks , fishermen, and the white collar version the very few competent engineers that are left, we are tired of you people in the first 3 groups please get your shit together we are already letting you coast, wipe your ass with silk,  and in some cases steal pleAse get your shit together before something bad happens im sick of working 55 hour weeks

This code implements a walk-forward backtest for a 3-factor term structure model of commodity futures prices that switches between two parameter regimes based on ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) climate conditions. The model uses a Kalman filter framework where:

* **State dynamics**: Three latent factors (level, slope, curvature) evolve according to mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes
* **Regime switching**: When the ONI (Oceanic Niño Index) exceeds a threshold, the model switches to ENSO-specific parameters that capture climate-driven volatility scaling and adjusted risk premia
* **Walk-forward calibration**: Parameters are recalibrated on a rolling window of historical observations as new data arrives, separately for each regime

Key model components include risk premium adjustments, variance convexity terms, and climate-dependent volatility scaling. The backtest maintains parallel Kalman filter states for both regimes during transitions, with rollforward protection to handle outliers and near-expiry numerical instabilities.

Configuration values (kappa, sigma, lambda, etc.) have been replaced with `-----` placeholders and should be populated from calibration results before running.

# DAWN OVER THE WILDERNESS

**November 25, 1971 - 6:47 AM**  
**Cascade Mountain Range, Southwest Washington**

The sun came up cold and grey over the forest.

Sergeant Michael Brennan stood at the edge of a logging road, drinking coffee from a metal thermos, watching the first light filter through the Douglas fir trees. The trees were massive... some of them two hundred feet tall, their trunks so thick that three men holding hands couldn't reach around them. Between the trees, the forest floor disappeared into shadow and undergrowth so dense you couldn't see more than twenty feet in any direction.

Brennan had been a Search and Rescue coordinator for the Washington State Police for twelve years. He had found lost hikers, located crashed planes, and recovered bodies from ravines and rivers. He knew this wilderness closely... knew how vast it was, how hostile and how easy it was for something to vanish completely into the green darkness.

And now he was supposed to find a man who had jumped out of an airplane somewhere in this forest last night.

Behind him, the staging area was coming to life. FBI agents dressed in dark suits and overcoats... completely wrong clothing for a wilderness search, but they hadn't expected to be doing this when they woke up yesterday morning. Military personnel from Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, many of them Vietnam veterans who knew something about operating in difficult terrain. Local sheriff's deputies.... volunteer search and rescue teams.... helicopter pilots doing pre-flight checks on their aircraft.

More than three hundred people, all mobilized in the twelve hours since D.B. Cooper had jumped into the darkness.

The problem was simple and overwhelming... nobody knew exactly where he had jumped.

The FBI had calculations... based on the time First Officer Rataczak felt the tail pitch upward... 8:13 PM... and the aircraft's estimated position at that moment, they had drawn a box on the map. A search area roughly twenty-five miles long and fifteen miles wide, centred on the Lewis River valley between the small towns of Ariel and Amboy.

Three hundred and seventy-five square miles of wilderness.

That's bigger than New York City.... bigger than most people could really imagine. And unlike New York City, which is flat and full of streets and buildings, this was vertical terrain... mountains, valleys, rivers cutting through canyons, cliffs that dropped away without warning. And every square inch of it was covered in forest so thick that you could walk past something ten feet away and never see it.

*""We're looking for a needle in a haystack,""* Brennan said to the FBI agent standing next to him... a young man named Peterson who looked like he had never been in a forest before in his life.

*""Except the haystack is three hundred square miles,""* Peterson replied, staring at the trees with visible unease. *""And the needle might be buried under leaves. Or in a river.... or hanging in a tree two hundred feet off the ground, where we'll never spot it.""*

*""Or he might have walked out already,""* Brennan added*. ""If he survived the landing. If he didn't break both legs... didn't get tangled in his parachute and suffocate.... didn't hit a tree at forty miles per hour and die on impact. If he didn't land in the river and drown. If... ""*

*""I get it,""* Peterson interrupted. *""The odds aren't good.""*

*""The odds are terrible,""* Brennan corrected. *""But we still have to look.""*

At 7:00 AM, the helicopters lifted off.

**The Search Begins**

The first helicopter passed over the Lewis River valley just as the sun cleared the eastern mountains.

Inside the aircraft, FBI Special Agent Ralph Himmelsbach pressed his face against the window, scanning the forest below. From the air, the wilderness looked even more impossible than it had from the ground. An endless carpet of green, broken only by occasional clearings where logging operations had carved temporary wounds in the forest. The Lewis River wound through the valley like a silver snake, its water grey and cold, moving fast with November rain.

Himmelsbach was forty-two years old, a veteran agent who had worked bank robberies, kidnappings, and organized crime cases. He was methodical, patient, and obsessed with details. And this case... this bizarre, audacious hijacking had grabbed him in a way no other case ever had.

Because D.B. Cooper had done something impossible. He had hijacked an aircraft, gotten his ransom, and jumped into the darkness. And now, twelve hours later, nobody had any idea whether he was dead or alive. Whether his body was lying broken at the base of a tree somewhere below, or whether he was already out of the forest, already gone, already spending his two hundred thousand dollars somewhere far away.

The helicopter pilot's voice crackled through Himmelsbach's headset:

*""What exactly are we looking for?""*

*""Parachute canopy,""* Himmelsbach said. *""If he landed in the trees, the parachute should be visible from the air. White or beige fabric, probably tangled in branches. Or if he made it to the ground, look for disturbed earth, broken branches, anything that looks like something heavy fell through the forest.""*

*""That's basically describing the entire forest,""* the pilot said. *""Trees fall all the time. Branches break in the wind. There's disturbed earth everywhere.""*

Himmelsbach knew he was right. But what choice did they have?

For three hours, the helicopter crisscrossed the search area, flying low enough that Himmelsbach could see individual trees, high enough that they could cover ground quickly. They saw logging roads, abandoned cabins, and the occasional deer bounding through clearings. They saw the river, the roads, the small towns clustered along highways.

**They saw no sign of D.B. Cooper.**

On the ground, search teams fanned out along the logging roads that cut through the forest. Teams of five or six people, moving slowly through the undergrowth, calling out to each other to maintain contact. In a forest this dense, it was easy to become separated, easy to get lost yourself while looking for someone else who was lost.

Deputy Sheriff James Wilson led one of these teams, three other deputies, and two FBI agents following him in a loose line. They had been walking for ninety minutes, covering maybe two miles of ground... painfully slow, but moving any faster in this terrain was impossible. The undergrowth grabbed at their legs. Fallen logs blocked their path every hundred feet, forcing them to climb over or detour around. The ground was uneven, full of hidden holes and rocks that turned ankles.

*""This is insane,""* one of the FBI agents muttered, pausing to catch his breath. *""He could be fifty feet away, and we'd never see him.""*

Wilson, who had grown up in these mountains and knew them like some people know city streets, nodded grimly.

*""That's the problem with this forest,""* he said. *""It doesn't give up its dead easily. We've got hikers who went missing in the sixties that we never found. The forest just swallows them. Ten years later, maybe a hunter stumbles across some bones...or maybe never.""*

They kept walking. Looking at the base of trees, hoping to spot fabric or equipment. Looking up into the branches, hoping to see a parachute tangled in the canopy. Looking everywhere and seeing nothing but endless trees.

By noon, none of the ground teams had found anything significant. A few pieces of trash... beer cans, old newspapers, a rusted car bumper from some long-ago logging truck. But nothing that had anything to do with D.B. Cooper.

The helicopter teams were not having better luck. They had covered most of the primary search area... the zone where Cooper most likely would have landed based on the FBI's calculations. They had seen nothing that looked like a parachute, or a crash site, nothing that suggested a man had fallen from the sky here last night.

At 1:00 PM, the search teams broke for lunch. They gathered at the staging area... the muddy clearing where they had started that morning... eating sandwiches and drinking coffee, comparing notes.

*""Nothing in sector three.""*

*""Nothing in sector seven.""*

*""We covered the entire north ridge.... nothing.""*

Sergeant Brennan stood at the centre of the group, looking at a map spread across the hood of a police cruiser. The map showed the search area divided into numbered sectors. Next to each sector number, someone had written ""CLEAR"" in pencil as teams reported back.

But ""clear"" didn't really mean clear. It meant they had walked through that area and hadn't seen anything obvious. It didn't mean Cooper wasn't there. In a forest this dense, you could walk within twenty feet of a body and never see it beneath the ferns and fallen logs and shadows.

Agent Himmelsbach joined Brennan at the map.

*""What do you think?""* Brennan asked.

Himmelsbach took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He had been up for nearly thirty hours straight... since the moment the hijacking began yesterday afternoon. He was running on coffee, adrenaline, and the stubborn belief that if they just looked hard enough, they would find something.

*""I think we need more people,""* Himmelsbach said. *""Three hundred isn't enough. Not for an area this size.""*

*""I can get you more people,""* Brennan said. *""The problem is, more people don't necessarily mean better results. You put too many searchers in the forest, and they start interfering with each other. They contaminate evidence. They get lost themselves. Search and rescue isn't about throwing bodies at a problem. It's about systematic, careful work.""*

*""Then we need more time.""*

*""We've got time,""* Brennan said. *""Question is, does he?""*

That was the calculation hanging over everything. If Cooper was injured but alive... maybe with broken bones, maybe hypothermic but still breathing... every hour that passed reduced his chances of survival. The temperature last night had dropped to around thirty-eight degrees Fahrenheit at ground level. Not freezing, but cold enough to kill someone wet and injured and wearing nothing but a business suit.

If he had survived the landing, he might have twelve hours before hypothermia shut down his organs. Maybe twenty-four if he was tough and lucky.

**They were already thirteen hours in.**

*""We keep searching,""* Himmelsbach said*. ""Until we find him or until we're certain there's nothing to find.""*

The afternoon search continued with the same result... **nothing.**

By 5:00 PM, the sun was already setting... November days were short this far north. The search teams withdrew from the forest as darkness fell. Night searching was too dangerous.... You couldn't see where you were going. You couldn't spot evidence. All you could do was get lost yourself and create a second rescue operation.

The helicopters returned to base. The ground teams loaded back into their vehicles. The staging area emptied out, leaving only a few FBI agents and local police officers who would maintain a presence overnight in case Cooper somehow walked out of the forest and gave himself up.

Nobody really expected that to happen.

In a motel room in the small town of Woodland, Washington... the closest town with actual lodging... Agent Himmelsbach sat on the edge of his bed, staring at a topographical map spread across the cheap carpet. The map showed elevation lines, rivers, roads, and the dense green shading that indicated forest coverage.

Somewhere in that green maze, D.B. Cooper had landed last night.

Dead or alive? Himmelsbach didn't know.

**But he was going to find out.**

**November 26, 1971 - Thanksgiving Day**

Most Americans spent Thanksgiving Day eating turkey and watching football.

The search teams spent it walking through the forest in freezing rain.

More volunteers had arrived overnight. National Guard units…. more FBI agents flown in from Seattle and Portland. Even some civilian volunteers... local hunters and outdoorsmen who knew the terrain and wanted to help.

The search area was expanded. If the FBI's calculations about Cooper's jump location were wrong... if he had jumped earlier or later than 8:13 PM, if the aircraft's position had been different from what they estimated... then he could be anywhere in a corridor stretching from Portland to well past the Lewis River.

They searched all day. Through rain that turned the forest floor into mud… through undergrowth that soaked their pants to the knees…. through terrain that seemed designed by nature specifically to hide things.

And they found nothing.

That evening, as search teams returned to the staging area for the second night, the mood had shifted. The initial optimism... the belief that they'd find Cooper quickly, that he couldn't have gotten far... had evaporated.

This wasn't going to be a quick search with a neat resolution. This was going to be long, frustrating, and probably futile.

*""He's dead,""* one of the local sheriff's deputies said, warming his hands around a cup of coffee. *""Has to be. Either he died on impact, or he's lying out there with broken legs, already dead from exposure. Nobody survives jumping out of a plane at night in the rain wearing a business suit.""*

*""Maybe,""* Brennan said. *""Or maybe he was better prepared than we think.""*

*""What do you mean?""*

*""I mean, what if he had survival gear we don't know about? What if he had a second set of clothes waiting somewhere? What if this whole thing was more carefully planned than we're giving him credit for?""*

The deputy shook his head. *""You're giving him too much credit. He's a jumper, not a genius. And now he's a dead jumper.""*

But Brennan wasn't so sure.

Because here is what bothered him…. Cooper had been smart about everything else. He had specifically chosen a Boeing 727 because it had the rear airstair. He had specified exact flight parameters... altitude, speed, flaps, landing gear... like someone who understood aircraft aerodynamics. He had demanded four parachutes to make sure authorities didn't give him sabotaged equipment. He had tied the money bag to his body using a parachute cord.

***Every single thing Cooper had done showed planning, intelligence, and technical knowledge.***

So why would someone that smart jump into a forest at night in a business suit with no survival gear?

Unless he had survival gear. Unless there was equipment waiting for him on the ground. Unless he had stashed clothing and supplies somewhere in the forest before the hijacking, planning for exactly this moment.

If that were true, if Cooper had really thought this through that carefully, then maybe... he had actually pulled it off.

But Brennan kept these thoughts to himself. No point speculating without evidence.

**The search continued for five more days.**

By November 30, they had covered most of the primary search area and large portions of the secondary zones. They had walked hundreds of miles of forest floor. They had photographed thousands of trees from helicopters…. had investigated every suspicious object, every piece of debris, every potential clue.

**And they had found exactly nothing.**

No parachute, no money, no body, no equipment, no clothing…. not even a footprint.

It was as if D.B. Cooper had simply ceased to exist the moment he stepped off that aircraft.

**On December 1, the active search was officially suspended.** They had kept a few people assigned to follow up on tips and investigate any new evidence that emerged. But the large-scale operation... the helicopters and hundreds of searchers and daily systematic grid searching... was over.

They had failed.

Agent Himmelsbach returned to his office in Seattle, frustrated and exhausted. The biggest hijacking case in American history, and they didn't even have a body to show for it.

But if they couldn't find Cooper in the forest, maybe they could find him another way.

**Maybe the evidence he had left behind in the aircraft would tell them who he was.**

# THE EVIDENCE ROOM

**FBI Seattle Field Office**  
**December 3, 1971**

The conference room on the third floor had been converted into a war room.

One entire wall was covered with a massive map of Washington State, with the search area outlined in red marker…. pins indicated where search teams had covered ground. Photographs of the terrain were tacked up along the edges.

Another wall held photographs of physical evidence, crime scene photos from inside the aircraft. Close-ups of the black necktie... the cigarette butts lined up on white paper…. the two parachutes Cooper had left behind.

A third wall was beginning to fill with faces. Suspects…. persons of interest. Already, there were more than fifty photographs. Soon there would be hundreds.

Agent Himmelsbach stood in the centre of the room, coffee cup in hand, staring at the evidence wall.

*""Talk me through what we've got,""* he said to the team of forensic specialists, and investigators gathered around the conference table.

Special Agent Morris, the lead forensic analyst, opened a folder and began reading from his report:

*""Physical evidence recovered from the aircraft consists of the following items. One black clip-on necktie, manufactured by JCPenney, style discontinued in 1968. Two: a mother-of-pearl tie clip attached to the necktie. Three: eight cigarette butts, Raleigh brand with filters,* *recovered from the ashtray at seat 18-E. Four: one strand of dark brown head hair, recovered from the headrest of seat 18-E. Five: one additional hair sample recovered from the armrest. Six: approximately sixty latent fingerprints lifted from various surfaces the subject touched during the hijacking.""*

*""Tell me about the fingerprints first,""* Himmelsbach said.

*""We've run them through every database we have,""* Morris replied. *""FBI criminal database, military records, federal employment records. No matches.""*

*""So he's never been arrested?""*

*""Not for anything serious enough to require fingerprinting. And if he had military service, he either served before fingerprinting became standard, or his records were destroyed, or he somehow avoided being printed.""*

That was interesting. Most veterans who served after World War II had been fingerprinted as part of their service records. The fact that Cooper's prints didn't match any military files suggested either that he had never served, or that he had served so long ago that records no longer existed, or that there was some other explanation.

*""What about the cigarette butts?""* Himmelsbach asked.

*""Raleigh filter tips,""* Morris said. *""Not a premium brand. Retail price in 1971 was about fifty cents per pack. The cheapest brand on the market would be around thirty-five cents. So he's smoking budget cigarettes but not the absolute cheapest available.""*

*""What does that tell us?""*

*""Possibly financial stress. Someone is watching their money even on small purchases. Or it could just mean he prefers that brand. Hard to say.""*

*""Can we get anything else from the cigarettes? Saliva? DNA?""*

Morris hesitated. *""We're preserving them for future analysis. DNA testing is still experimental... might be ten or twenty years before it's reliable enough for forensic use. But if we preserve the evidence properly, future technology might be able to extract useful information.""*

Himmelsbach made a note: ***Preserve cigarette butts at all costs. May be most valuable evidence decades from now.***

**He had no idea how prophetic that note would prove to be.**

*""What about the tie?""*

*""JCPenney brand, discontinued in 1968,""* Morris said. *""It's a clip-on style... no actual knot required. Just clips onto the collar. Common among businessmen in the sixties and early seventies who wanted to look professional without the hassle of tying a real tie.""*

*""Age of the tie?""*

*""Based on the discontinued date, it's at least three years old. Could be older. Shows normal wear... not brand new, not falling apart. Just a regular tie that someone's worn regularly for a few years.""*

*""The tie clip?""*

*""Mother-of-pearl. Inexpensive. The kind you'd buy at any department store for a few dollars. Nothing distinctive about it.""*

Himmelsbach walked closer to the photograph of the tie pinned to the wall. It looked like something his own father might have worn. Plain… unremarkable. The kind of thing you had seen on a thousand men in any office building in America.

But it had been around Cooper's neck. His skin had touched it. His sweat had soaked into the fabric. Somewhere in the fibers of that tie might be evidence that would eventually identify him.

*""What about microscopic analysis?""* Himmelsbach asked. *""Fibers, particles, anything stuck to the fabric?""*

*""We've done preliminary analysis with standard microscopy,""* Morris said. *""Found common clothing fibers, dust particles, skin cells. Nothing remarkable. But technology is improving all the time. I recommend we preserve the tie for future analysis with more sophisticated equipment.""*

Another note: ***Preserve the tie. Could be critical evidence with better technology.***

*""Hair samples?""*

*""Dark brown, Caucasian. The lab says they can't determine age from a hair sample, but they can confirm race and colour. Matches the description witnesses gave... dark-haired white male.""*

*""Can we use it for identification? Compare it to suspects?""*

*""With current technology, hair comparison is subjective... an analyst looks at the samples under a microscope and judges whether they're similar. It's not as reliable as fingerprints. But again, future DNA technology might be able to extract genetic information from hair roots.""*

Himmelsbach circled the evidence table, looking at each item in its clear plastic evidence bag.

A tie. Some cigarette butts. Two hairs. Sixty fingerprints.

That was what they had to identify a man who had vanished into the wilderness with two hundred thousand dollars.

It didn't feel like enough.

*""What about the parachutes he left behind?""* Himmelsbach asked.

This question was directed at Earl Cossey, the professional parachute rigger who had provided the parachutes to authorities during the hijacking. Cossey had been brought in to examine the parachutes Cooper had left behind and provide expert analysis.

Cossey, a lean man in his forties with the weathered face of someone who spent a lot of time outdoors, stood up and walked to a table where the two abandoned parachutes lay.

*""These are the two he didn't take,""* Cossey said, pointing to each one in turn. *""This one is a functional reserve parachute. Fully operational. I packed it myself the day before the hijacking. If he had chosen this one, he could have used it for his jump.""*

*""Why didn't he take it?""*

*""No idea. Maybe he didn't like how it looked. Maybe he didn't understand the difference. Or maybe he had specific reasons for choosing the ones he did take.""*

*""Which ones did he take?""*

*""He took one of the NB-6 main parachutes... that's a military-issue emergency bailout rig. And he took this.""* Cossey pointed to the second abandoned parachute*. ""Or rather, he didn't take this... he took the other reserve parachute.""*

*""What's special about the one he took?""*

Cossey's expression darkened. *""The one he took was a training parachute. A dummy rig. The canopy is sewn shut. It can't deploy. It's completely non-functional.""*

The room went silent.

*""Wait,""* Himmelsbach said slowly. *""Are you telling me Cooper jumped out of an aircraft with a parachute that doesn't work?""*

""Not exactly. He took two parachutes with him... one main and one reserve. The main parachute was functional. It would have opened fine. But the reserve he took was the dummy rig. If his main parachute had failed and he had tried to deploy the reserve, it wouldn't have worked. He had fallen to his death.""

*""Did he know it was non-functional?""*

*""I don't know. The parachute is marked to indicate it's for training only. But the markings might not be obvious to someone who's not familiar with parachute equipment. In the dim cabin light, under stress, he might not have noticed.""*

*""Or?""* Himmelsbach prompted.

*""Or he examined it carefully and knew it was non-functional, and he took it anyway for some other purpose.""*

*""Like what?""*

Cossey shrugged. *""Maybe he cut the parachute apart to use the fabric for something. Maybe he used the harness as part of his gear. Maybe he wanted the extra shroud lines... he had already cut some lines from one of the reserve chutes to tie his money bag. Maybe he thought having two parachutes would look more credible even if one didn't work.""*

Himmelsbach made another note: ***Why take a non-functional parachute? Accident or intentional?***

*""Tell me about his parachute knowledge,""* Himmelsbach said. *""Based on his choices, based on how he handled the equipment, what's your assessment? Was he an experienced jumper?""*

Cossey thought carefully before answering.

*""That's complicated. Some things he did suggest knowledge. He examined the parachutes carefully before accepting them, as if he were checking for sabotage. He cut shroud lines from the reserve chute to make a harness for the money... that shows understanding of how parachute equipment works. He knew enough to demand both main and reserve parachutes, which suggests familiarity with standard skydiving practice.""*

*""But?""*

*""But he made choices that don't make sense for an experienced sports jumper. He took the NB-6 military parachute instead of the more modern reserve parachutes. The NB-6 is an automatic-opening rig... it deploys immediately when you pull the ripcord. You can't control when it opens. And once it's open, you can't steer it. It's just a big canopy that lowers you straight down at a fixed rate of descent.""*

*""Maybe he wanted an automatic-opening parachute,""* Himmelsbach suggested*. ""Maybe he was worried about losing consciousness during freefall, or not pulling the ripcord in time.""*

*""Possible,""* Cossey admitted. *""But an experienced jumper would want steering capability, especially jumping at night over forest. The ability to avoid trees and pick a landing spot is crucial. The NB-6 doesn't give you that. You go where the wind takes you and hope you don't hit anything solid.""*

*""So what's your conclusion? Expert or amateur?""*

*""I think he had some knowledge. Probably military training... the choices he made, the equipment he selected, all suggest someone who had done military parachute training at some point. But I don't think he was a sport skydiver. An experienced sports jumper would have made different choices.""*

Himmelsbach absorbed this. Military training. That aligned with other aspects of Cooper's behaviour. The discipline. The calm under pressure. The formal way he spoke to the flight attendants... calling them *""Miss""* and expecting to be addressed as *""Sir.""*

The profile was taking shape:

**Male, Caucasian, mid-to-late forties. Military background, probably Air Force or Army. Parachute training, but not expert-level. Some technical knowledge of aircraft. Financially desperate... smoking cheap cigarettes, wearing a three-year-old tie, willing to commit a serious crime for money. Polite, disciplined, methodical. Familiar with the Seattle-Tacoma area... knew local geography, recognized landmarks from the air.**

It was something…. but wasn't enough.

Thousands of men fit that profile. Tens of thousands, maybe. How many Air Force veterans in their forties lived in the Pacific Northwest? How many of them had parachute training? How many were desperate enough for money to hijack an airplane?

They needed more.

*""What about the money?""* Himmelsbach asked. *""Are we ready to track it?""*

Special Agent Thomas, who'd coordinated the ransom assembly with Seattle First National Bank, nodded.

*""Every bill's serial number has been photographed and recorded on microfilm,""* Thomas said. *""We have the complete list... all ten thousand bills. The bank is keeping the original microfilm in secure storage. We've distributed copies to every FBI field office in the country, every major bank, every law enforcement agency that might encounter the bills.""*

*""What happens if someone tries to spend one?""*

*""The moment any of these bills enters circulation through normal channels... deposited in a bank, used at a business that sends cash to a bank, exchanged at a currency exchange... it should be flagged. The serial number will match our list, and we'll know immediately.""*

*""What are the odds Cooper can spend the money without getting caught?""*

Thomas considered. *""If he tries to spend it normally... buying things at stores, paying rent, depositing it in a bank... We'll catch him within days. The problem is if he's smart about it.""*

*""Smart how?""*

*""He could spend it slowly. One twenty-dollar bill at a time, at different businesses, spacing it out over months or years. That makes it much harder to track. Or he could exchange the bills for other currency... go to Canada or Mexico, exchange the twenties for local currency in small amounts at different exchanges. That breaks the chain of tracking. Or he could just sit on the money for a few years. Wait until the banks stop actively checking serial numbers, then gradually start spending it.""*

*""How long will banks actively check?""*

*""FBI policy is to maintain active surveillance of stolen currency serial numbers for five years. After that, it goes into archival databases that are checked less frequently. So if Cooper is patient, if he can wait five or ten years, his chances of spending the money without detection go up significantly.""*

Himmelsbach didn't like that answer. But it was realistic. The FBI couldn't maintain active surveillance of ten thousand serial numbers forever. Resources were limited. Other cases demanded attention. Eventually, the Cooper case would fade from immediate priority, and when that happened, Cooper's chances of getting away with it improved.

Unless they caught him first.

*""All right,""* Himmelsbach said, addressing the full team. *""Here's where we are. We don't have a body. We don't have a confirmed identity. What we have is evidence that will help us identify suspects and eliminate them. So that's what we do. We start building a list of every man who might fit the profile. And we investigate them one by one until we find him.""*

*""How long is that going to take?""* one of the younger agents asked.

Himmelsbach looked at the growing wall of suspect photographs. Fifty faces already. And they had barely started.

*""As long as it takes,""* he said.

**December 1971 - January 1972: The Tip Line**

The FBI established a dedicated phone line for Cooper tips. Within the first week, they received more than eight hundred calls.

Most were useless. People reporting their neighbours, ex-husbands, or co-workers because of some grudge or suspicion that had nothing to do with actual evidence. People calling to confess to the crime themselves... these were almost always mentally ill individuals seeking attention. People reported sightings of Cooper at gas stations, restaurants, or bus depots, none of which could be verified.

But some tips seemed credible.

A woman in Oregon called to report that her ex-boyfriend... a former Air Force paratrooper who had been acting strangely in the weeks before the hijacking... had disappeared on November 24 and hadn't been seen since. The FBI investigated. They tracked down the ex-boyfriend in California, where he had moved to take a new job. He had time-stamped receipts proving he had been in Los Angeles during the hijacking. **Eliminated.**

A man in Seattle called to say his brother-in-law worked for Boeing, had parachute training, and had recently complained about needing money. The FBI investigated. The brother-in-law was at a Thanksgiving dinner with twenty witnesses when the hijacking occurred. **Eliminated.**

A bartender in Portland called to report a customer who had been drinking heavily the night of November 24 had arrived around midnight looking dishevelled and muddy, and had paid his bar tab with a stack of twenty-dollar bills. The FBI investigated. They tracked down the customer... a construction worker who had been working a late shift and had come straight from a job site, explaining the mud. He had been paid in cash that day by his employer. The bills' serial numbers didn't match the ransom. **Eliminated.**

One by one, the tips were investigated and dismissed.

By January 1972, the FBI had looked into more than three hundred potential suspects. They had eliminated two hundred and twenty of them through various means... alibi verification, physical description mismatch, fingerprint comparison, age discrepancy.

Eighty suspects remained under active investigation.

*And the list kept growing.*

**February 4, 1972**

Special Agent Charles E. Farrell submitted his comprehensive report on the D.B. Cooper investigation. The report was three hundred and thirty-six pages long, documenting every aspect of the case from the initial hijacking through the current status of the investigation.

The report included detailed timelines, witness statements, physical evidence analysis, suspect profiles, and Farrell's own assessment of what had likely happened.

His conclusion, after reviewing all available evidence, was sobering:

*""Based on the conditions present at the time of the subject's jump... darkness, rain, freezing temperatures, inadequate clothing, hostile terrain... and the lack of any evidence suggesting successful escape, this investigator assesses that the subject known as 'D.B. Cooper' most likely did not survive his jump from Flight 305. His body likely remains in the wilderness of southwest Washington, possibly suspended in trees or covered by undergrowth, and may not be discovered for years if at all. However, without recovery of remains, this conclusion cannot be considered definitive.""*

Agent Himmelsbach read the report in his office, then set it aside.

He understood Farrell's reasoning. The evidence did suggest Cooper was dead. But Himmelsbach couldn't shake a feeling... completely unscientific, based on nothing but instinct... that Cooper had somehow pulled it off.

Because everything else about this case had been smart, careful, well-planned. Why would Cooper plan everything so carefully only to jump to his death in a business suit?

Unless the business suit was a misdirection. Unless there was more to the plan than anyone knew.

Himmelsbach opened a new file folder and wrote on the tab: **D.B. COOPER - ACTIVE INVESTIGATION**.

*Then he got back to work.*",0,1767508436.0,WhyDoWeNeverAsk,3,0.5,False

This guide is intended for accessing legal content only—public domain materials, Creative Commons licensed files, open-source software, and content you own. Always verify the legality of what you're downloading.

Your ISP just blocked The Pirate Bay. Again.

Whether you're trying to grab open-source software or access public domain content, ISP blocks are frustrating. The good news? There are legitimate ways around these restrictions—if you know what you're doing.

I've spent years testing different methods to access geo-blocked content, and in this guide, I'll walk you through the most effective techniques for unblocking The Pirate Bay. More importantly, I'll show you how to do it safely.

# ✅ Quick Answer: Best Way to Unblock The Pirate Bay

Using a VPN is hands-down the most reliable way to access The Pirate Bay. A quality VPN like **NordVPN** masks your IP address, encrypts your connection, and routes your traffic through servers in countries where The Pirate Bay isn't blocked. Unlike proxy sites that can expose your data or Tor that slows everything to a crawl, VPNs offer the best balance of speed, security, and reliability.

# Why Is The Pirate Bay Blocked in So Many Countries?

The Pirate Bay isn't blocked because governments hate file sharing—it's blocked because the site hosts massive amounts of copyrighted content. Courts in dozens of countries have ordered ISPs to restrict access based on copyright infringement concerns.

Here's where you'll run into blocks:

|Region|Countries Blocking TPB|
|:-|:-|
|**Europe**|UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Romania, Greece, Russia|
|**Americas**|Argentina, Brazil|
|**Asia-Pacific**|Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Singapore|
|**Middle East**|Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE|

**The twist?** Even in these countries, The Pirate Bay remains accessible through workarounds. ISPs block the domain, but they can't block every method of access. That's where VPNs come in.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Some countries block TPB aggressively (China, UAE) while others have blocks that aren't strictly enforced. A VPN works regardless of how strict the ban is.

# Method 1: Unblock The Pirate Bay With a VPN (Best Option)

VPNs are the gold standard for accessing blocked sites. Here's why they beat every other method:

* **Actual security:** Your traffic is encrypted—ISPs can't see what you're doing
* **Reliable access:** Server networks span countries where TPB isn't blocked
* **Fast speeds:** Unlike Tor, VPNs don't crater your download speeds
* **Multi-purpose:** Protects all your internet activity, not just torrenting

# Step-by-Step: Accessing TPB With a VPN

**1. Choose a VPN that supports torrenting**

Not all VPNs allow P2P traffic. Stick with providers that explicitly support torrenting on their servers. I recommend **NordVPN**—it offers dedicated P2P servers, military-grade encryption, and verified no-logs policies.

**2. Download and install the VPN app**

Sign up, download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS), and log in.

**3. Connect to a server where TPB isn't blocked**

Select a server in:

* **Switzerland** (unrestricted access, strong privacy laws)
* **Netherlands** (fast servers, close to Europe)
* **United States** (massive server network)
* **Mexico** (unrestricted, good speeds)

**4. Verify your connection**

Check that your IP has changed by visiting [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net). You should see the VPN server's IP, not yours.

**5. Access The Pirate Bay**

Navigate to thepiratebay.org or one of its official mirror sites. You're in.

# Why NordVPN Works Best for This

I've tested over 30 VPNs for torrenting, and NordVPN consistently delivers:

|Feature|Why It Matters|
|:-|:-|
|**8,800+ servers in 129 countries**|Easy to find servers where TPB isn't blocked|
|**NordLynx protocol**|WireGuard-based—blazing fast for large downloads|
|**Dedicated P2P servers**|Optimized specifically for torrenting|
|**Verified no-logs**|Independently audited—your activity isn't stored|
|**Threat Protection**|Blocks malware and ads (critical on torrent sites)|
|**Kill switch**|If VPN drops, your connection cuts—no IP leaks|

🔒 **Security Note:** Free VPNs are terrible for torrenting. They log your data, inject ads, and often leak your real IP address. Don't risk it.

# Method 2: Use Pirate Bay Proxy Sites (Quick But Risky)

Proxy sites mirror The Pirate Bay's content on different domains. When the main site is blocked, these mirrors let you access the same torrents.

# Working Pirate Bay Proxies

These proxies were functional at the time of writing:

* pirateproxy-bay.com
* thepiratebay7.com
* thepiratebay0.org
* piratebay.party

**How proxies work:** Instead of visiting thepiratebay.org directly, you access a clone hosted on a server in an unrestricted country. The proxy fetches content from TPB and displays it to you.

# The Major Downsides

Proxies aren't secure solutions:

❌ **No encryption** — Your ISP sees everything  
❌ **Malware risk** — Fake proxies inject malicious code  
❌ **Unreliable** — Proxies get shut down constantly  
❌ **Slow speeds** — Often overloaded with traffic

If you use a proxy, **always** run it through a VPN for encryption. Never browse proxies with your real IP exposed.

# Method 3: Access TPB Through Tor Browser

The Tor network anonymizes your traffic by bouncing it through multiple volunteer-run servers. It's the most private method—but comes with serious trade-offs.

# How to Access The Pirate Bay via Tor

1. Download [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
2. Install and launch the browser
3. Connect to the Tor network (takes 30-60 seconds)
4. Navigate to thepiratebay.org or a .onion mirror

**Tor's advantage:** Near-total anonymity. Your traffic is encrypted at multiple layers, making surveillance extremely difficult.

**Tor's massive problem:** Speed.

Torrenting through Tor is **painfully slow**. Your connection routes through 3+ random servers, adding huge latency. A download that takes 10 minutes on a VPN might take hours through Tor.

Plus, the Tor Project explicitly asks users not to torrent over Tor—it clogs the network and hurts people who rely on it for safety in oppressive countries.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Use Tor if anonymity is paramount and you're only downloading small files. For actual torrenting? VPNs win every time.

# Method 4: Change Your DNS Settings (Hit or Miss)

Some ISPs block The Pirate Bay at the DNS level. Your router queries your ISP's DNS server, which returns ""blocked"" instead of TPB's IP address.

Switching to public DNS servers sometimes bypasses this:

**Recommended public DNS:**

* **Cloudflare:** 1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1
* **Google:** 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4
* **Quad9:** 9.9.9.9 / 149.112.112.112

# Quick DNS Change (Windows)

1. Open **Settings** → **Network & Internet** → **Change adapter options**
2. Right-click your connection → **Properties**
3. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** → **Properties**
4. Choose **Use the following DNS server addresses**
5. Enter: Primary: `1.1.1.1` / Secondary: `1.0.0.1`
6. Click OK and restart your browser

**The catch?** This only works if your ISP's block is DNS-based. If they're blocking at the IP level (most common), changing DNS won't help. Still worth trying—it takes 2 minutes.

# Best VPNs for Unblocking The Pirate Bay (Tested)

I've benchmarked these VPNs specifically for torrenting performance. Here's what actually works:

# 1. NordVPN — Best Overall for Torrenting

|**Specification**|**Details**|
|:-|:-|
|Servers|8,800+ in 129 countries|

|Encryption|AES-256-GCM|
|Kill Switch|Yes (automatic)|
|Price|$2.99/month (2-year plan)|
|**Winner**|🏆 Speed + Security|

**What I liked:** NordLynx protocol is ridiculously fast. Downloaded an 8GB file in under 5 minutes on a US server. The kill switch actually works (tested by killing the connection mid-download—internet cut immediately).

**What I didn't:** Monthly pricing is steep ($12.99). You need to commit to the 2-year plan for the best rates.

# 2. Surfshark — Best Budget Option

|**Specification**|**Details**|
|:-|:-|
|Servers|4,500+ in 100 countries|
|Speed (average)|200+ Mbps|
|P2P Support|All servers|
|Encryption|AES-256-GCM / ChaCha20|
|Connections|Unlimited|
|Price|$1.99/month (2-year plan)|
|**Winner**|🏆 Value for Money|

**Why it's great:** Unlimited simultaneous connections. Protect every device you own for less than the price of a coffee. CleanWeb feature blocks torrent site ads automatically.

# 3. ExpressVPN — Fastest Speeds, Premium Price

|**Specification**|**Details**|
|:-|:-|
|Servers|3,000+ in 105 countries|
|Speed (average)|250+ Mbps|
|P2P Support|All servers|
|Encryption|AES-256|
|Protocol|Lightway (proprietary)|
|Price|$3.49/month (annual plan)|
|**Winner**|🏆 Raw Performance|

**The verdict:** ExpressVPN is objectively the fastest VPN I've tested. If speed is your priority and budget isn't, this is it. The Lightway protocol cuts connection times to under 2 seconds.

**The downside:** Pricey. You're paying for premium performance.

# 4. CyberGhost — Easiest for Beginners

|**Specification**|**Details**|
|:-|:-|
|Servers|11,651+ in 100 countries|
|Speed (average)|180+ Mbps|
|P2P Support|Optimized torrent servers|
|Encryption|AES-256|
|Price|$2.19/month (2-year plan)|
|**Winner**|🏆 User-Friendliness|

**Why beginners love it:** One-click torrenting profiles. Select ""For Torrenting"" and CyberGhost auto-connects to the best P2P server. No configuration needed.

# How to Download Torrents Safely (Avoiding Malware)

The Pirate Bay is notorious for hosting fake torrents packed with malware. Here's how to avoid getting wrecked:

# Check the Uploader

**Trusted uploaders have badges:**

* 🌟 **VIP** — Verified, trusted for years
* ☠️ **Skull** — Trusted uploaders

Avoid torrents from brand-new accounts with no upload history.

# Read the Comments

Scroll down. If people are saying ""This is a virus"" or ""Infected my PC,"" believe them. Legitimate torrents have comments like ""Thanks, works great!"" or technical questions.

# Verify File Sizes

A 4K movie shouldn't be 50MB. A game shouldn't be a single .exe file. If the file size is suspiciously small, it's fake.

# Use Antivirus Software

Run downloads through antivirus before opening. Windows Defender works, but dedicated tools like Malwarebytes catch more threats.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Never disable your antivirus to run a torrent. If something ""requires"" you to disable security software, it's malware.

# Common Issues and Fixes

# ""The VPN is connected but I still can't access TPB""

**Solution:** Clear your browser cache and cookies. Sometimes old session data reveals your real location. Use incognito/private mode.

# ""Download speeds are terrible""

**Try this:**

1. **Switch VPN servers** — Some get congested
2. **Use a closer server** — Distance = slower speeds
3. **Change VPN protocol** — WireGuard is fastest
4. **Enable split tunneling** — Route only torrent client through VPN

# ""My ISP is throttling my VPN traffic""

If your ISP detects VPN use and slows you down:

* **Use obfuscated servers** (NordVPN offers these)
* **Change VPN port** to 443 (looks like regular HTTPS)
* **Try different protocols** — Some are harder to detect

⚡ **Performance Insight:** I've found that connecting to servers geographically close to you almost always delivers better speeds. A Netherlands server from London beats a US server from London.

# FAQ: Your Questions Answered

**Is it legal to use a VPN for The Pirate Bay?**

Yes. VPN use is legal in almost every country (except China, Russia, UAE with restrictions). However, what you download can be illegal. Stick to public domain and open-source content.

**Can I get caught torrenting with a VPN?**

Only if your VPN leaks your IP address or doesn't have a kill switch. Quality VPNs like NordVPN prevent leaks. Free VPNs? They leak constantly.

**Do free VPNs work?**

They ""work"" in that they might connect, but:

* They log your data and sell it
* They inject ads into your browser
* They leak your real IP
* They're incredibly slow

Don't use free VPNs for torrenting. Period.

**What if The Pirate Bay is down?**

Try mirror sites:

* thepiratebay10.org
* thepiratebay7.com
* pirateproxy.live

Or check if it's actually down at [isitdownrightnow.com](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/thepiratebay.org.html)

**Can I use a proxy instead of a VPN?**

You can, but you shouldn't. Proxies don't encrypt your traffic—your ISP sees everything. Use a VPN for actual security.

# Final Thoughts: Access TPB Safely or Don't Access It At All

Look, The Pirate Bay has been around for over 20 years for a reason—it's resilient. But accessing it without proper protection is asking for trouble.

ISPs monitor torrent traffic. Copyright holders send DMCA notices. Malware infects unprotected devices. The risks are real.

**If you're going to access The Pirate Bay, do it right:**

1. Use a reputable VPN (NordVPN is my top pick)
2. Enable the kill switch
3. Only download legal content
4. Check uploader credibility and comments
5. Run antivirus scans on everything

The methods in this guide work—I've tested them extensively. But none of this matters if you're not careful about what you download.

I’m a 26 year old guy in New Zealand looking to meet new friends and see where things naturally go. I’m all about easy, real conversations, sharing random thoughts, everyday stuff, or diving into deeper topics over time.

I’m into staying active, hitting the gym, playing sports, long walks, exploring new spots, good coffee, and binge watching movies or shows. I like chats that feel effortless, and I’m happy to start with memes, shared interests, or casual talks. If we click and we’re local, meeting in person could be fun, no pressure.

A few things I’m curious about:

- What’s something small that made you smile this week?
- Any quirky hobbies or hidden talents people usually don’t guess?
- Book, show, or movie you’ve been hooked on lately? (I just finished Stranger Things!)
- If you could wake up anywhere tomorrow, where would it be?
- Your go to comfort food or drink?
- A random fact or skill you’re secretly proud of?
- Do you have a favorite sport or way to stay active?

Hey everyone,

Relocated from Mumbai and I’m still navigating the rhythm of the city. I’m a 32-year-old guy, fully independent, and looking to build some genuine connections here intwin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.

I’m at a stage where I value quality over quantity. Whether you’re looking for a solid friendship, a partner in crime for exploring, or something with a ""benefits"" element (FWB), I’m open to seeing where things go if the chemistry is right.

A bit about me:
The Vibe: Chill, easy-going, and drama-free.
Interests: Big on movies (theaters or home), long drives, exploring the local food scene, traveling, and catching live shows/events.

Host Status: I live independently and can host occasionally for the right person/deserving vibes.

Nights in: Huge fan of the classic Netflix & Chill—sometimes a quiet night in with good food and a movie is better than a night out.

What I’m looking for:
Someone who is authentic, independent, and down to actually do things rather than just text forever. If you’re up for a drive, a dinner date, or just hanging out at my place to unwind, let's talk.

If this resonates with you, slide into my DMs with a bit about yourself and what you’re looking for.

1q3ihte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Craps/comments/1q3ihte/vegas_trip_report_12261229/,Vegas trip report 12/26-12/29,"My Brother and I decided when the NFL schedule came out that we would go watch our POS NY Giants in las vegas when they went to go play there. 

""We'll probably be watching a game with heavy draft implications"" is what I texted him after we locked in the plans and lo and behold...

Anyway- Id been dinking dunking and stashing away winnings over the course of a month to have as a bankroll roll for the trip since my brother never played craps so I fully intended to show hime the beauty of this wonderful game. With a bankroll just north of 6k I was ready to fucking touch some dice. 

We both arrived around 11pm and i immediately won 600 at the bubble craps station in the airport terminal. ""This is either a great sign or I just blew my load way too early"". 

He gets off his flight and to my despair he tells me hes come down with a cold and will be calling it an early night so he can get after it with me all day saturday. 

I sadly agree its for the best and let him head up to his comped room (my comp) at the cosmo while i head to my own. I try to force myself to sleep but the visions of box cars and parlayed hard 8s dance around in my head too much. 

I grab my dice throwing shirt, shoes and pants and head straight down to the best crew on the strip, the cosmo craps pit. 

First shooter sets their point 50 pass, 270 out please, 50 for the bonus+ 3 way, thank you lets go shoote- 6-1. 

Ok no worries lets get the cubes warm lucky number 5's the point lets do the 270 across again , 59 bonuses and three way lets go shooter cmon sh- 6-1. 

I think you know where this is going. 

After getting my face ripped off at the table i decide to try the bubble. Down another 800 there. 

I go to the bar for a drink and realize I just tanked half my bankroll in less than 30 minutes. 

I go upstairs. Angrily order room service. Angrily binge the room service, forxe myself to bed, and dream of those beautiful box numbers coming in all night. 

The next day the cosmo buffet had snow crab legs at the brunch buffet.  I had about 8 crabs worth of them and a spinach salad and black coffee.  

My brother and I decide to go back down to the cosmo casino so i can show him how to play. I find some relatively lucky shooters and am up 800 pretty quickly. He immediately understands the beauty of the game but has yet to witness the horror. 

We play some blackjack that sees me lose another 600 before deciding to head to fremont to check out the cheap casinos and their retard strength beverages. 

First stop is el cortez- the knicks were playing so we parked our asses at the bar extending into the high limit slots area and played virtual bj to keep the free drinks coming while we watched the knicks. 

Lady luck started filming a youtube video near us and I was embarassed to know who she was so before i did or said anything cringeworthy i suggested we check out their crapless table because i wanted to play the hardway all day bonus. 

My brother goes off to get another drink while i sit at the infamous elco craps table that ive seen hundreds of hours worth in bluffs videos. 

Same as last night at the cosmo- 270 across. 50 pass, 50 for the bonus (10-15-10) but instead of 15 on the three way i put 15 on the hardways all day. 

Shooters rolling pretty well, peppering the inside box numbers. He hots his point twice and im up a good amount. He rolls a hard 10 and i think to myself, ""hold on hes rolled a few hardways already...""

Hes rolled three of four, only needs a hard 6 to win it. Holy fuck when did this happen

Holy fuck it pays 156-1??

Holy fuck i have 15 on it??

Holy fuck he just hit his point again?!

The puck goes off, my brother cones over and sees im up huge already. 

I whisper to him, well out of sight and earshot of the shooter, ""if this dude roles a hard 6, I win 2400 fuckin dollars"". 

""You know what to do now"" the shooters friend calmly tells him. The shooter sets his dice and doesnt hesitate to roll them. 

THREE. THREE. 

LETS FUCKIN GO SHOOTER. LETS FUCKIN GO. HOLY FUCK. 2400 LETS FUCKIN GO. GOD DAMN. 

The entire area by the craps put quiets down and I have way more eyeballs on me than i expected 

""Sorry...sorry, im just excited sorry"". The pit boss and dealers laugh and say not to apologize theyre happy too. 

I tip the shooter 100 for no good reason, he had 25 on it too, and tipped the dealers 100 as well. In hindsight im a bit too generous with gambling winni gs but it is what it is. 

We walk away from elco up 3k and practically back to my original bankroll. 

Then we made the mistake to walk fremont. 

First up was circa- where its not called craps, its called ""Dice"". 10 minimum but i justt scored big so might as well do my 270- PSO. 

OK lets try again at this long ass deep assmorbidly obese bathrub looking ass table- PSO. see ya!

Then to binions, where I waxed poetic to my brother about how this is where the real gambling happens, where people scape together dollars to try their luck and make it something grand. 

They have a half tub! Awesome! Lets try it! 4 more PSO's! Not awesome!!

And just like that, im down another 2k. 

We get back to the cosmo and my brother is beat so he heads to bed. 

The stadium craps is open and i havent quite quenched my thirst of the bones yet. Its just me and the dealer so i go toe to tow with the backwall. 

I do practically every strategy you can think of in crapless. Come bet strat, iron cross, 440 reduce, you name it I try it. I just cant make a profit. Back to my room, taile between legs, angry room service, angry sleep. 

The next day the giants wont the football game. 

On the walk back to the cosmo we did what any good northeastern tourist to vegas does and we hopped more casinos. 

I went on a demi-god roll at the mgm grand but was so drunk that on the walk to the bar i lost one of my 500 buck chips. I went back to the same craps table and demanded they help me won it back lol. I went on a decent roll with mostly points hit and won another 600 to cover my stupidity. 

Losing the chip spooked me so we beelined it back to the cosmo where again we called it a night as we had shitty morning flights the next day. 

All in all, it was a rope a dope kind of trip with no serious breakthroughs besides the Hardways all day bonus hit. 

Cant wait till next time. ",9,1767507505.0,Craps,2,0.92,False
