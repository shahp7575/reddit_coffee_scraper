Choosing the Right Propane Outdoor Fire Pit Table for Your Space
----------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the perfect propane outdoor fire pit table for your space can be both exciting and overwhelming. With so many options available, it’s essential to consider various factors to ensure that you choose a table that complements your patio, offers functionality, and enhances your outdoor experience. By keeping your unique needs in mind, you can select a fire pit table that will serve as a stunning centerpiece and a source of warmth for years to come.

### Consider Your Space

The first step in choosing the right propane outdoor fire pit table is to evaluate the size of your available space. Measure the area where you plan to place the table. Remember to account for surrounding furniture and movement space. A fire pit table should facilitate interaction while lingering in comfort. You can consider the following:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-tables-propane  
  
- **Compact Areas:** If you have a smaller patio or balcony, look for round or oval-shaped tables that can fit in tighter spaces.
- **Spacious Areas:** Larger spaces can accommodate bigger rectangular or square tables, which can serve as both a fire pit and a dining table.

### Choose the Right Style

Next, think about the style of your propane outdoor fire pit table. The design should reflect your personal taste and match your overall outdoor decor. Here are some style ideas to consider:

- **Modern:** A sleek, minimalist design works well with contemporary outdoor spaces.
- **Rustic:** Wooden or stone finishes can add a cozy, natural feel.
- **Traditional:** Classic wrought iron or ornate designs can enhance a traditional garden setting.

### Material Matters

The material of your fire pit table plays a significant role in its durability and aesthetics. Common materials include:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-tables-propane  
  
- **Steel:** Offers excellent durability and can withstand various weather conditions. Look for tables with weather-resistant coatings.
- **Aluminum:** Lightweight and resistant to rust, aluminum is perfect for easy mobility.
- **Cast Iron:** Known for its strength, cast iron also retains heat well but may require more maintenance.
- **Stone or Concrete:** These materials provide a sturdy feel and often come in beautiful rustic designs, but they can be heavier and may require a solid base.

### Safety Features

When selecting a propane outdoor fire pit table, prioritize safety features. Always look for models equipped with:

- **Flame Control:** Adjustable flames allow you to set the right level of heat for your gathering needs.
- **Automatic Shut-Off:** Systems that turn the flame off automatically if the fire pit gets too hot can increase safety.
- **Screen or Cover:** A protective screen can help keep sparks contained, providing an added layer of safety.

### Portability and Maintenance

Consider how often you'll move your fire pit table and the maintenance required. If you want flexibility, a lightweight table would be ideal. For maintenance:

- **Cleansing:** Regular cleaning prevents debris buildup, which can affect performance and aesthetics.
- **Storage:** If you live in an area with harsh winters, consider a model that can be easily stored indoors or comes with a protective cover.

### Budget Considerations

Setting a budget before shopping can help narrow down your options. Propane outdoor fire pit tables come in a wide range of prices, so it's essential to find one that meets your needs without breaking the bank. Consider the benefits of investing in a quality table, which may offer better durability and design.

Taking the time to consider these factors will ensure that you select the perfect propane outdoor fire pit table for your outdoor living space. With the right table, you’ll create a warm and inviting atmosphere for gatherings with friends and family, offering the chance to enjoy cool evenings by a beautiful fire.

1hh2cly,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisclaimerAppleTV/comments/1hh2cly/post_ep_4_hear_me_out/,Post Ep 4 Hear me out...,"Okay so my friend and I just finished episode 4, in which we finally get the full story of why Catherine is such a ""horrible bitch"" and why she ""deserves"" Kevin Kline ruining her life. Now hear me out...unless future episodes give us the story from a different lens...I don't see how Catherine is particularly evil in any extraordinary way. Let's see:

1) she meets a horny young man in Italy and after flirting with him, they BOTH share responsibility for having an affair and cheating on their partners. Sasha may not be married and co-parenting with Jonathan, and we may be conditioned to see her and her feelings as disposable becauses she is a ""loose girl,"" but he did cheat on her all the same. 

2) They have sex and take photos in a bedroom of Catherine's hotel suite (?) Not sure exactly where they were but Nicholas was in another room and it appears he woke up during the night and called out for her and she said to go back to sleep. Yes, I know we are conditioned to believe that ""good mommies"" jolt out of bed sprinting to their child's bedside to comfort them every time they toss and turn in the night, but you know, in actual real life, it's also acceptable for parents to yell down the hall ""you're okay, go back to sleep."" 

3) On the beach, Catherine does two things wrong...she asks a woman to keep an eye on Nicholas while she goes to the bathroom (to have sex with Jonathan) and then later takes a nap, during which time Nicholas decides to paddle his floatie into the sea. 

4) When Nicholas is being rescued, the entire beach tries to rescue him but comically forget about Jonathan until seconds too late and basically leave him to die even though they all see him in the water before two other men take over for him. Catherine appears to look out into the water for 5 seconds before anyone else on the beach remembers him. Apparently we are supposed to believe SHE alone killed him, not any of the other 30+ people involved in the rescue,  because she didn't call out 5 seconds earlier. 

Okay, let me know if I missed any of Catherine's transgressions. Look, this is where you have to hear me out. I just don't have a hate boner for this woman like I'm supposed to. I actually don't want to see her life destroyed, I don't want Kevin Kline to try to get Nicholas to kill himself or whatever in revenge against Catherine. I feel for Sasha Baron Cohen, but people get cheated on all the time, including Jonathan's girlfriend, and me in the past, and it's not really an excuse to ruin someone's career or harm their children. I get that by modern helicopter parent standards Catherine is a ""bad mommy"" but I happen to not want to see women destroyed for that. Parenting is different across different eras and cultures. In Denmark, parents leave their babies in strollers on the sidewalk briefly while they enjoy a coffee. Even American kids of 1 generation ago used to roam the streets every day until the streetlamps came on. Now a coworker of mine in America had CPS called on her because a Karen was mad her kids were riding bikes up and down the street in front of her house. I think part of the reason young women don't want kids anymore is because the helicopter mommy standards are so exhausting - that's another conversation, but it's contributing to why my reaction to this depiction of ""evil Catherine"" is to roll my eyes at the screen and go ""okay?""

Yes, Catherine is bad for inviting her affair partner into the hotel suite where her son was sleeping down the hall. Yes, I realize in current year, you're expected to bring your child into the toilet with you and not nap until they're safely locked inside a house with you. But...I just don't care. Sorry. I just don't want to keep watching this series and see Catherine get bullied by Kevin Kline because of these sins we learn about in episodes 3 and 4. The only justification Kline could have for revenge is the 5 seconds a shocked Catherine was looking at Jonathan in the water, but I don't see how Jonathan's parents could possibly know about that. Kevin Kline already sent the naughty affair images to Sasha Baron Cohen, giving him the info he needed to decide to leave Catherine. That's already justice served in my opinion. 

So, my question is, in future episodes, do we get a different perspective on Catherine's sins? Is it going to be like The Last Duel, where we see the rape of Jodie Comer by Adam Driver from the rapist's delusional perspective before seeing the true events from the victim's perspective? Are Jonathan's parents somehow able to learn about these details, or are they just hunting down and punishing Catherine because she had an affair with Jonathan before he chose to follow her into the water, and therefore somehow she's responsible for him drowning, even though an entire beach full of people literally just left him to die even though everyone clearly saw him. Honestly after watching the end of episode 4, they are more responsible for Jonathan's death than Catherine. Unlike the Italian bureaucrat told Jonathan's mother, the lifeguard DID eventually come to rescue Nicholas,  but simply left Jonathan to die, even though the lifeguards were clearly able to identify that the two men who went to rescue Nicholas after Jonathan needed support to get out. Are we supposed to blame Catherine more than the trained water rescue professionals here for forgetting about Jonathan? 

Okay rant over, at this point, I just feel like the series is trying to get me to hate Catherine when she seems like a perfectly unremarkable human being. I'm capable of hating female characters. I absolutely was cheering on the downfall of Rosamund Pike in ""I Care a Lot"" and that awful headmistress from Harry Potter (the one who wears pink). But at this point, if this is all Disclaimer is giving me to work with, I just can't summon the will to erect a hate boner for Catherine. Watching her downfall will annoy me unless they're going to give me something else to work with. So, let me know. Spoilers welcome. ",1,1734530933.0,DisclaimerAppleTV,0,1.0,False

I'm hoping to get some guidance on breaking into the financial services world (asset management, PE, IB, HF). My reasoning for this choice is from a conversation I had with a good friend who is a PM. Told me his fund was built for people who didn't have  a lot to get a shot at wealth and showed me letter from families who invested with him and how appreciative they were. It gave me the same feeling and purpose as my previous career.

I'm a 30y/o male who left over a decade long career as a paramedic in a busy city based 911 system. At the recommendation of friends and family I completed my MBA from Boston University back in May of this year. I was a general MBA, but targeted finance based classes. It was a really hard transition from my previous work and walked put with a 3.4. Leading up to and post grad I was applying for internships, and entry level jobs everywhere looking to get help from family and friends. A common response was ""You're to overqualified for entry roles because of your MBA, but you lack experience so you're not a good fit for a senior role"". I totally agree with the ladder of that statement! I was happy to take an entry level roles because it got me in. I landed a remote pharma consulting role, but there isn't much finance work to help with and learn from. I've had about 100 coffee chats that have been more disheartening than helpful. One person from a NYC IB group told me ""well you should just apply and get in, that's what happend to me. You are kind of old so you're way less valuable than someone in my age bracket"" she is 23...

Currently work full time in my consulting role and am pursuing my CFA lvl 1, my goal is to be so knowledgeable and skilled that I can break in regardless of the salary. I'm coming from a career of 40k a year and very happy so money was never the driving force, it was grand scale helping others.

After that long winded explanation, what I'm hoping to find is guidance on how people in my age bracket, and coming from such an odd background can break into finance careers.

Thank you all and sorry for the long read!

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1734530471.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

I started Zep mid September. Stepping on the scale this morning I thought I was going to be disappointed again as I've been hovering just above hitting the 40 pound target since before thanksgiving. To be perfectly honest, I'm feeling some scale dysmorphia, because this journey has been so unlike any other time I've lost weight.

What's working:

* **Calorie deficit using the LoseIt app**. I'm not religious about tracking, but it's been important to make sure I'm getting enough protein and staying within 1000-1200 calories/day. I aim for at least 100g/day of protein
* **Water!** I start each day drinking at least 8-16 oz before coffee or breakfast.
* **Strength training /Walking** \- I work out 3x/week with a trainer for 30 minutes. I'm not a gym rat. I walk a few miles almost every day, and with the cold weather, I ordered a walking pad (downsized version of treadmill). It's coming today! I choose exercise that will be sustainable and easy to fit within my schedule.
* **Eat food that remembers where it came from** \- I have Hashi's, so was eating pretty clean prior to going on Zep (limited gluten, dairy, red meat). I steer clear of processed foods, only occasionally using protein shakes (vegan) or protein bars.
* **MagO7** has been a game changer around avoiding any issue with constipation
* **Way less alcohol** \- prior to starting Zep I was having one bourbon/ginger beer nightly. I switched to a non-alcoholic bourbon and only occasionally indulge in the real stuff. Definitely helps curb inflammation + I read alcohol can inhibit Zep from working as well.
* **Therapy + Journaling** \- both have helped me to retrain my brain around negative thinking and I'm learning more about my triggers, which used to lead to me using food to soothe or tamp down feelings. For the first time in a long time, I have certainty I will get to my goal. When I start to go down a darker path, I push myself to name 5 things that are working right now. This simple trick really helps me elevate mindset.
* **Advocating for what I need** \- I fired my endocrinologist who wasn't listening when I told her I needed to move up my dosage. My PCP took over my script, and my dose at 7.5 is working well again with less food noise",2,1734530435.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

as someone incredibly unlucky and down the past few years, nobody associates with me anymore. everyone leaves me on delivered, even when i ask how they are. i’ll invite someone to hangout, they’ll reject the invitation and then go hangout with others and post about it. if someone’s feeling “kind” they might give me a 1 hour coffee date on a Monday night. I have always been mindful to keep my discussions of my situation to a minimum, to avoid negativity. when i lost my job and had trouble with the current job market, people stopped asking me to hangout. when i had two failed surgeries this year, people stopped asking how i am. now that my health has declined even worse, i have no contacts in my life anymore. they’ve all slowly faded away after pitying my situations and then treated me differently. this is very difficult as a 25 yo woman who desires the sanity of companionship and friends. this feels like a negative feedback loop that is nearly impossible to escape from. when i think about it — if i somehow miraculously had a change of luck, i wouldn’t want to associate with me in this situation or people like me either, I’d want to get away from it. i add nothing to the table anymore, i have no network that would entice another person my age to stay in contact with me. my health and career struggles have just compounded onto each other, and now i’m basically a shut in. i was never this way to this degree in my entire life, and it hurts so badly. i’ve also learned that some people i have known through my life aren’t real friends to discard me like this. what is one to do in my situation — or do i just accept a loner life confined to the outskirts of society which will someday lead me to end my life? I can’t live in total isolation like this. It’s not normal. 

Lots of people tell me to just accept the social isolation and rejection, but I’m a woman and I’m not built that way. I’m trying to understand and gain more insight. This level of isolation shaves years off of one’s life. Accept being alone, be independent, date yourself. I do all of these things. I have no issues being alone, I’ve traveled continents alone, I go on solo trips and dates alone. the issue isn’t spending time with myself. it’s that i am sick of being alone and so deeply lonely.

Inspired by other posts, here are some of my winners (and losers) this year.

**Favorites**

I absolutely loved DAK—it was my first batch order from them, and all four coffees were amazing. My absolute favorite was Blueberry Boom, but the others were also pretty close.

Next to DAK, I really enjoyed coffees from The Barn and 19grams (both in Berlin). My coffee journey pretty much started with 19grams, and they always deliver great coffee.

**Meh…**

I was quite disappointed with the coffee from Manhattan Roasters. It was by far the most expensive coffee I’ve ever bought, but in terms of taste, it fell behind the level of the other roasters mentioned above (at least for me—I’ve heard others say the same, but I wanted to test it myself).

The coffees from Five Elephant were also a bit underwhelming. I couldn’t get a great cup out of any of the ones I tried.

**2025**

What else should I try next year? What have been your favorite coffees and roasters this year?

I tried to get my hands on some Cinnamon Roll from DAK, but it was sold out everywhere.  
I’m also thinking of trying some other roasters and definitely plan to order a few more times from DAK.   
  
Also hoping for one more project like the decaf Project from James Hoffmann because I missed it and just ordered a Decaf bag just a week before the project started. \^\^

S&W was fairly light, but each of the three bags from Sey seem quite a bit lighter based on color and bean density. I tried each of them with my normal V60 recipe and was unimpressed. They lacked sweetness and felt one-dimensional; perhaps underextracted, yet my grind size was already pretty fine and drawdown times were pushing 4 minutes. I tried two of them with a little bit coarser grind size, and it reduced the drawdown time but didn't improve the taste.

So today I took out the Aeropress and brewed the third bag -- a Colombian Gesha -- for the second time. I used the same grind setting as the previous two bags (medium-fine-ish) and steeped for 8 minutes. Boom. Fantastic cup. I think these super-light washed coffees need high extraction, but it's hard to get with traditional pour over brewers like the V60. Maybe I could have pushed my grind size even finer, but based on my experience with the V60 I doubt I would have gotten a good cup that way.

1hh1sk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hh1sk7/am_i_a_horrible_partner/,Am I a horrible partner?,"I (26F) have been with my partner (24M) for two years, we’re happy and things are going so well. He proposed to me this past weekend. But I feel like a horrible partner to him. For context, I suffer from a few mental illnesses that affect my day to day life. I have depression, severe anxiety, borderline personality disorder, adhd, autism and cptsd. 

My depression comes in waves, every 4-6 months usually when the weather changes. My anxiety is an ebb and flow situation. Depends on what happens throughout the day. My bpd is horrible to live with and sometimes I don’t know how to deal with it so I self medicate by over eating, staying up all night and sleeping my days away. My adhd makes me forget tasks I have to do if they are not directly in front of my face. I slowly pick up the house everyday. Sometimes three things get done, sometimes I manage to tackle everything all at once in a day. But that’s not always the case. My autism isn’t too bad I’d say. I just have some days where it’s hard for me to do certain tasks because my brain doesn’t like the smell, texture or feeling. My cptsd was caused by severe childhood trauma. Which brings me to my point of this post. 

Because of my mental disorders sometimes I have trouble communicating what I need from my partner, and I suffer alone most days because I don’t want to burden him with having to deal with me. I also have bouts of depression which make me essentially useless when it comes to taking care of the house. Because half the time I don’t even want to be breathing anymore. Let alone worry about the dirty dishes. My mood can switch with the drop of a hat. Literally. I sobbed about that yesterday for 30 minutes because it was inconvenient and ruined my day. I stopped doing things that I used to at the beginning of our relationship, because I don’t think about it anymore. Like making his coffee for work and making sure his work clothes are always clean and neatly folded in the drawer. 

I know he loves me. He tells me everyday and shows me everyday. But I don’t feel like I deserve him. He’s a hardworking blue collar man, and I’m a depressed girl with suicidal tendencies that likes to eat her feelings and cry 25/7. 

What can I do to improve myself so that I can be a better person and partner to him? Any advice or kind words would be greatly appreciated. 😞",1,1734529205.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

1hh1ru8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hh1ru8/how_to_navigate_my_30f_partners_32m_close/,How to navigate my (30F) partners (32M) close friendship with an ex he still lives with?,"My (30F) partner (32M) and I have been together for about 4 months. We are in an exclusive, serious relationship that we both want to continue long  term. We currently live 4 hours apart. For context, my partner is from another country and has no family in the country where we live. His group of close friends is small, and he considers his ex partner as one of them (this was not disclosed to me early on). They were together 5 years and broke up about 18 months before we got together. 

Coming into this relationship, I knew he still lived with his ex girlfriend and that they had 2 dogs together. As they were still living together, early on I asked about the nature of their relationship, why they split up, why they are still living together and how he sees their relationship into the future to make sure I wasn't stepping into something messy. His answers gave me confidence that their relationship wasn't one that would make me uncomfortable. He told me their relationship was just housemates and that they hang out occasionally, but not often. They split up because she cheated on him, and he left. They are still living together because he struggled to find/afford somewhere else to live after going back to his home country for a few months after they split and he was helping look after the dogs whilst she would go away. He said that they would be casual friends that would catch up for coffee every now and again. I didn't see anything suss with that, and figured we would all eventually get along fine. 

There have been a few developments since then that have left me feeling very uncomfortable with their relationship:

* She called him the second time he came to visit me for a weekend during a mental health crisis. I'm not going to repeat exactly what she was saying, but she wanted him to come back home and told him she thought that they would eventually get back together and work things out etc. He ended up staying with me, but did seriously consider going back. 
* It has since been revealed that he considers her a close friend. When away on work trips, they have been in daily communication with each other, asking about how each other is going, sleeping, feeling, and sharing photos. They were also hanging out together outside of the house, giving each rides to places, and cooking for each other. 
* When I realized that they weren't just housemates, and that she was often turning to him for emotional support, I expressed my concerns and asked if he could pull back from being her primary support person. We talked and agreed he would limit their conservations to stuff about the dogs and mimise how much time they spend together. I've since found out he didn't really follow through on this, and they were still texting near daily and spending time together. 
* She still is isn't comfortable with me being around the house they live in, or meeting me. 

I'm feeling foolish, deceived and very hurt. He promises there isn't anything going on and that he has no feelings for her. I believe he doesn't have feelings for her, but I don't believe that she no longer has feelings for him. I feel like they are on the verge of having an emotional affair or maintaining an emotionally intimate relationship, just minus the physicality, and he is enabling this.

At this point, what hurts the most is the deception (either consciously or unconsciously), and that he doesn't seem to feel any remorse for the hurt he has caused me. We've had multiple discussions about this, and despite me trying to be understanding of the unique situation, he is quite defensive of their relationship and does not want to stop being close friends. He has said, more than once, that by me wanting him not to spend one on one time with her, or not having personal conversations often, that I'm trying to isolate him from one of his only close friends. I understand they live together, and that all contact can't be eliminated, but I do feel like it could be minimized. I do not want to isolate him from his friends (intentionally or unintentionally) but I feel like I'm been taken for a ride, and that whilst he is happy to respect her boundaries, he is resentful about the boundaries I need him to set. 

I'm feeling very insecure about this, and am unsure how I can navigate this in a manner that isn't toxic or controlling, and is empathetic to his feelings? However, I really do not feel comfortable with him staying in constant contact and maintaining a close friendship with her. The few friends I have discussed this with have all said I'm not being unreasonable, but their perspectives are obviously biased. 

He is in the process of finding somewhere else to live, but I don't think that will really do much to change the dynamic of their relationship. 

  
TLDR: My  partner lives with his ex and has a close friendship with her. He misrepresented the nature of their relationship with me, and I'm no longer comfortable with their closeness. How can I navigate this situation without being toxic or controlling?",2,1734529139.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1hh1mbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingAddiction/comments/1hh1mbj/my_struggle_with_gambling_a_journey_from_euphoria/,My Struggle with Gambling: A Journey from Euphoria to Despair,"I want to share my experience with gambling, hoping that it might resonate with others who’ve faced similar struggles or might help me find a way out of this mess. It all started on my 18th birthday. In Europe, that’s the day you’re considered an adult, and with adulthood comes responsibilities, but in my case, it also led me straight into the world of gambling.

That night, after celebrating with friends and family, some older cousins and friends decided to take me to a casino. It was my first time, and I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I walked in with just 20 euros, but I left with 1,000. For an 18-year-old, unemployed, and still in high school, that was an unbelievable sum. It felt like a huge win, but I didn’t know it would be the beginning of a very dangerous cycle.

The high of that initial win led me right back into the casino within days. I won another 500 euros, and that felt like enough to leave, so I did. But soon, gambling had become a regular part of my routine. Every day before school, I’d wake up early—not because I had to—but because I’d stop by the casino for a coffee and a quick spin on the machines. I wasn’t spending large amounts at first, usually 20 to 100 euros a day, but I was still doing it regularly. I didn’t have a job at the time, but I managed to scrape together some money here and there, often by borrowing from friends or family, and spent it all at the casino.

Fast forward a couple of years, and I’m 20. I’ve got a job now, but it’s not much. I’m making about 2,000 euros a month. After covering living expenses and bills, I was left with about 1,000 euros each month. And what did I do with it? I gambled all of it. Every single month. It got so bad that I wouldn’t even have enough money left to go out with friends or fill up my car with gas. I was living paycheck to paycheck, and the gambling consumed me.

Eventually, I took a loan from a creditor—2,000 euros—to gamble. And, predictably, I lost it all in one sitting. I was left with just 50 euros to survive for the next two weeks. This pattern continued for a while. The gambling wasn’t about enjoyment anymore; it was about chasing the high, the quick fix, even though I knew deep down it was ruining my life.

By the time I was 24, I thought I had finally gotten control. I hadn’t gambled in a year and had managed to save up about 25,000 euros. I was feeling good—until one day, I was with some friends who introduced me to an online casino. They’d won some decent money with a small deposit, so I thought, why not? It’ll be fun, right? A small gamble with my savings. But I lost it all. Every single penny—gone in one night.

Now, I’m back at square one, 10,000 euros in debt and feeling completely lost. Over the past 5-6 years, I’ve gambled away roughly 100,000 euros. No one knows. Not my girlfriend, not my family. They all think I’m doing well, that I have savings, that I’ve got everything under control. In reality, I don’t even have money for a pack of cigarettes today.

I’ve reached a point where I don’t even understand why money has no value to me. It’s not even about the rush anymore; it’s like a compulsion I can’t break. I can go without gambling for a while, and I don’t even miss it, but then something triggers me, and in a matter of seconds, everything is gone. The thought of winning again, of turning things around, feels so overpowering, and then it’s over.

I’m not sure what I’m asking for, but I need help. I need advice on why I treat money like it’s worthless and why I can’t seem to stop. If anyone has gone through something similar, or has any advice, I’d appreciate it. I know I’m not the only one dealing with this, but I feel so alone right now.",1,1734528640.0,GamblingAddiction,0,1.0,False

Xykon is an extremely powerful lich sorcerer, and is the main antagonist of the webcomic Order of the Stick, a world [that operates under the rules of Dungeons and Dragons 3.5th Edition](https://i.imgur.com/dCTMpLX.png).^124 As a young boy he realized he had been born with magic powers such as raising the dead and shooting lightning, and soon decided to use these powers to take whatever he wanted and kill whoever got in his way. In his old age when between schemes he was approached by the goblins Redcloak and Right Eye, who wanted his help gaining access to extradimensional gates that the absurdly powerful monster known as The Snarl contained within. Assuming that he could control this monster and conquer the world, Xykon quickly agree. However their first attempt at attacking these gates saw him imprisoned and without his magic, forcing [Redcloak to turn him into an undead lich.](https://imgur.com/a/giYswsL)^SD With this newfound power Xykon quickly proved to be a much greater than he ever had been alive, and together with Redcloak (Right Eye having been killed) and an army of expendable minions, they sought out the other gates in the hopes of furthering their plans (while not-so-secretly not trusting each other in the slightest). They would also repeatedly find themselves in conflict with the adventuring party known as the Order of the Stick, all for the silly reason of avenging a murder and trying to save the world.

***“Only those with narrow minds fail to see that the definition of Impossible is ‘Lack of imagination and incentive.’” -Serena Butler (Dune: The Butlerian Jihad, by Brian Herbert)***



**– – – The Great Merge, New York, 1986 – – –**



Victor Castella was enjoying a cup of hot cocoa when the first tremors were felt, and while earthquakes did happen in this region of the States, they were rather rare. Still, Victor was confident that nothing bad would happen, they were probably just distant aftershocks that’d finally reached them. He and several other patrons of the local coffee shop chuckled and smiled at one another, finding some measure of novelty in the sensation of the ground shaking briefly under their feet.



Yet when the tremors didn’t stop, nor did they diminish but instead grew stronger, chuckles and smirks gave way to concern and soft murmurings of confusion.



When the sky turned black, and an aurora borealis swirled overhead in the middle of the day, they knew something was well and truly wrong. As people began to take cover in all the places they’d ever been told to, a sensation of intense heat settled over them. At first, those in the know about such things thought perhaps someone had launched a surprise nuclear attack against them, which would account for the heat and perhaps the tremors. But when a purple energy went sweeping by, they knew it was not a nuclear weapon.



The heat began to suffuse their bodies and Victor shuddered as he felt a twisting in his gut, as though he was about to lose his lunch. Something snapped in him, a gnawing hunger forming, and he staggered out onto the street as did many others, beginning to run in pursuit of the light that had already swept out to sea.



His body burned, his blood boiled and all that he was was melting away as the hunger grew more intense, and as more of whatever had struck the city continued to seep into him. Thousands of people streamed out of the city and countless other cities, following the light, following the hunger. As they did, some collapsed, their bodies no longer able to contain the pure magic that flowed into them, perishing on the spot as the final remnants of humanity fled, severed. They didn’t stay down for long, picking themselves back up with blue veins of pure magic crisscrossing beneath their flesh, and they continued to run.



In time, those who ran all perished, then returned, undead creatures who streamed into the mountains, then into the caves of those mountains, where they feasted on new mana pools that had formed in the wake of the merge.



It was here that they lived, where they congregated, till eventually there was nothing left to feed on, and so as one, the Severed turned their focus outwards. Towards fresh prey.



**– – – Inelthemar, Realm Primus, Present Day – – –**



*Whispers surrounded the white robed figure, his features obscured by a deep, shadowy hood. Six arms shifted restlessly upon his throne, matched in action by the multitude of tentacles that had long ago replaced his legs. Great wings which contained swirling power twitched and fluttered as he sat forward, casting their light upon the dark floor like light passing through water. He felt a touch of something drawing closer, something ancient and new, yet somehow recognizable, yet it was so far away, so distant it could not be near, not even in the same realm.*



*It clicked, then, where he had last felt such a thing and his blood, what little remained, burned hot with the sting of a betrayal most unexpected and potent. His rage was not explosive like that of some of his subjects, it did not lash out blindly at anything in his immediate vicinity, yet it made itself known by other means.*



*A deep tremor ran through the room and the air, dust and debris pattering gently as it fell from ledges near the ceiling, and the tremors extended out into the glittering city that surrounded his throne room. The beings who flitted about and supped on only the best wines, foods and even living beings, trembled as they felt their liege’s anger wash over them. It brought with it confusion and worry, for never had he let his emotions show so.*



*The tremor subsided and the Undying Emperor leaned back, pondering this development, while uttering but a single word, a name to be precise.*



*“Irhaal…”*



**– – – Neremyn Pass, Realm Castellum/Eldarani (Earth/Efres), Three days since leaving Irallin – – –**



The looming mountain range was quite spectacular, though a far cry from the Alps or really any of the larger mountain ranges that Earth had sported before the merge. For one thing, Evelina could see six different avenues of travel through the mountains. One, however, looked to be far easier than the others, which was probably why it had a name and a very visible road through it.



She turned her head and could not see where the mountains ended, and wondered just how long it all was. Still, that wasn’t overly important, it wasn’t like humanity couldn’t simply go over the mountains with planes and vehicles. Luckily, it seemed that the elves had long ago laid down stoneworks for the pass, smoothing it all out for ease of travel on foot. How smart, how thoughtful, it surely wouldn’t come to bite them in the ass when humanity came trundling along in tanks and trucks.



It was for this particular pass that they were heading, and they seemed to be the only travellers at the moment, which suited her just fine. Yet she couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched, and figured that after four hours of such a feeling, it was probably wise to make a mention of it.



“Erissir… I think we’re-”

“Aye lass, we are. Keep actin like ye have been. We make it ta the pass and we’ll take a few wee shortcuts I know, throw them off our scent… or find out who they are.” He kept his voice low, low enough that not even an elf could have eavesdropped. Evelina nodded, reaching out absentmindedly to pat Berernger, who could sense that something was troubling them.



She wanted to turn and confront whomever it was that was following them, but that would be stupid and reckless, so she would do as Erissir said. She would trust him on this and hope it wouldn’t bite her in the ass later.



Reaching the base of the mountains she could now see that the way up was a smooth ramp, with flat areas at regular intervals to allow animals and people to rest and continue or camp for the night. A smart thing to account for if she was being honest, from the look of it the ramp would be a bitch to do in one go.



With a deep breath they began the climb, and she was thankful that the incline was not too steep.



Reaching the first flat area of the path she waited till the lip of the ramp would hide them from sight and split off a single copy, sending them sprinting forward and diving into the foliage that surrounded the lower levels of the ramp. Erissir gave her a curious look and she just smiled, offering no comment on what she’d just done.



The copy would wait, still as a statue and watched for those who were following them, while Evelina and Erissir would continue the climb. What the copy saw was most interesting. A cloaked pair of figures were who made it to the first level about a minute or two later, each moving nearly in lockstep as they made no clear indication that they knew of the copy.



Next were a pair of halflings, though these seemed to be a husband and wife simply off to the next village or city and thus of no concern. The copy nodded to itself and dissolved away, returning to the original who inhaled deeply as the memories of what it had seen in such a brief existence were given over.



“Two unknowns, cloaked, tall. Probably elves.” She murmured, Erissir grunting softly and tilting his head back a bit, peering upwards at the mountaintops.



“Alrighty then, next level we make a break fer it. Head left towards a grouping of blue colored rocks, ye’ll find a wee tunnel, perfect fer us dwarves but ye elvish types will have to duck a bit. Dunno about the beasty… might be too big.”



She glanced at Berernger, who locked eyes with her for a moment before lowering himself a bit closer to the ground.



“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it, friend. Just lead the way.” She murmured with a soft smile, the dwarf nodding and clearing his throat softly, or rather, as softly as a dwarf could. They continued on, reached the next level and immediately set off sprinting, Berernger grabbing Erissir by the back of his armor and hoisting him off the ground as the bear moved far faster than the dwarf did. As a result there was a bit of indignant curses thrown about.



Those did not last too long as the bear gave the dwarf a little toss as they reached the group of out of place rocks, Erissir landing with a little stumble before rejoining Evelina in the sprint.



As he had said, there was indeed a wee tunnel, and just as they squeezed into it they heard a shout from behind them as the cloaked figures noted that they’d been made.



Erissir led the way, waddling along at a speed that seemed reckless to her in such a small space, but he moved with such confidence that she was certain it was born from a life raised underground. Berernger had the most trouble, just as the dwarf had suspected he might, the bear having to wriggle through some excessively cramped spaces but he could manage it just fine apparently.



“We’ll pop out into a bit of a cave system, we dwarves marked a route we can take ta get ta the other side of the mountains, plenty of places we can ambush these idiots as well.”



“Right!” Was all she could say as she ducked under a protruding bit of stone, the tunnel widening out into a pleasantly sized cave that wasn’t going to trigger elvish claustrophobia anytime soon. She wished they had more time to explore the place, she loved caves, but instead of exploring they were still moving with some haste towards a peculiar object. That being a somewhat large statue of a dwarf who had both arms outstretched, one pointing down another tunnel and the other pointing back the way they’d come. A very effective means of giving directions.



“There’s a side passage we can use, we’ll get the drop on em and find out who sent them.” The dwarf almost sounded giddy at the idea of beating up a few people who were not magical zombies. And after having fought the Severed, Evelina couldn’t exactly blame him for feeling so, for she felt the same. “‘Ere we are, turn left here!”



Erissir turned left and ran face first into a very large, very metal fist. The dwarf was slammed onto his back, completely knocked out and before Evelina or Berernger could do anything about halting their forward momentum, they were met with fist and sleeping magic. The last thing she heard as the world went black was a gravelly voice.



“Take them back to camp, we’ll find out their little secrets soon enough.”

Turns out, finding a part-time job in London is harder than spotting a pigeon without an attitude or getting on the Tube without delays! I've been on the hunt for ages, and at this point, I’m starting to feel like a character in a Netflix drama called ""The Unemployed Chronicles.""

I’ve tried everything – cafés, shops, and even staring wistfully at “We’re Hiring” signs hoping they’d hire me telepathically. So, here’s me throwing out a cheerful S.O.S! If anyone knows of any part-time gigs, has a hot tip, or could toss me a referral, I’ll be forever grateful (and happy to bribe you with snacks or coffee).

Let’s make this city a little less lonely and a lot more helpful. Job-hunt hacks, good vibes, or even a pep talk are all welcome here!

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his nerdy quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.


So if you're a fellow lover of coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? So I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into business and investments, frustrated law student, can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck (sarcasm towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha).

- I'm 5'10"", physically fit, resides in quezon city. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and hygienic

- I'm an INTJ, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in horoscope.

- Loves to read self-help books as I love to learn and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set feasible goals and actively pursue them.

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your overall health and well-being. But have you ever wondered, ""How much water should I be drinking a day?"" This question is more complex than it seems. While the traditional advice suggests eight 8-ounce glasses (about 2 liters), science provides a broader perspective on hydration needs, influenced by various factors.

Water is critical for every body function. It helps regulate temperature, keeps joints lubricated, and allows organs to function properly. But how do you determine your personal hydration needs? Let’s explore the science behind this important question.

### Factors Affecting Daily Water Intake

Your daily water requirements can vary due to several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals typically require more water.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise regularly, you’ll need additional fluids to compensate for lost sweat.
- **Climate:** Warm or humid weather raises fluid needs.
- **Diet:** Foods that contain water, like fruits and vegetables, reduce the amount of water you need from beverages.
- **Age:** Older adults may find it harder to sense thirst, increasing the risk of dehydration.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain illnesses or conditions, like fever or vomiting, require increased fluid intake.

### The Science Behind Hydration Recommendations

The general recommendation that you need eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily is a good rule of thumb, but not a one-size-fits-all solution. Experts suggest a more tailored approach that factors in your unique lifestyle. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends the following daily water intake:

- **About 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) for men**
- **About 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) for women**

This total water intake includes all beverages and food, so you don’t have to drink water alone to meet these guidelines. Foods like cucumbers, oranges, and soups contribute significantly to your hydration.

### Listening to Your Body

Your body often gives you signals to indicate your hydration needs. Thirst is a natural cue, but it’s essential to stay ahead of this signal, especially during exercise or high temperatures. Here are some effective ways to monitor your hydration:

- **Urine Color:** Light yellow urine typically indicates proper hydration. Dark urine can signal dehydration.
- **Thirst:** If you’re feeling thirsty, drink water before it escalates.
- **Energy Levels:** A drop in energy might be linked to dehydration.

### Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated

To ensure you're drinking enough water every day, consider these simple strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** A reusable water bottle can serve as a constant reminder to drink.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or apps to remind you to drink water.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Adding fruits or herbs can make drinking water more enjoyable.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Having a glass of water before each meal helps boost hydration.

These habits can seamlessly increase your daily water intake, making hydration feel natural rather than forced. You might even find that you feel more energized as a result.

### : Finding Your Balance

While the general recommendations provide a solid framework, the ideal amount of water for you can differ based on various individual aspects. Pay attention to your body’s signals, adapt to your environment, and remain mindful of your lifestyle. By prioritizing hydration, you'll not only improve your health but also enhance your overall quality of life.

The Role of Hydration in Physical Performance and Recovery
----------------------------------------------------------

Hydration is a vital aspect of physical performance and recovery. When you engage in activities that demand energy, your body needs water to function optimally. Understanding the role of hydration can significantly impact your overall athletic performance and recovery times.

The human body is composed of about 60% water. This high percentage underscores the importance of staying hydrated. Water is involved in numerous bodily functions, such as regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and delivering nutrients to cells. Without sufficient hydration, these processes can falter, leading to decreased performance and increased fatigue.

### The Impact of Dehydration on Performance

One of the first things to notice about dehydration is its potential to impair physical performance. Even a small drop in hydration levels — around 1-2% of body weight — can negatively affect your athletic abilities. Here are some consequences of dehydration:

- **Reduced endurance:** Lack of water can lead to an increase in body temperature, which can hinder your ability to sustain prolonged physical activities.
- **Decreased strength:** Muscle function relies on water to facilitate contractions. Dehydration can lead to muscle fatigue and cramps.
- **Slowed recovery:** When your body is dehydrated, it takes longer to recover from exertion, leaving you more susceptible to injury.
- **Impaired cognitive function:** Hydration plays a key role in maintaining focus and decision-making during sports activities.

### Hydration Guidelines for Optimal Performance

Knowing how much water you should be drinking can make a significant difference. While individual hydration needs may vary based on factors such as age, weight, climate, and physical activity level, some general guidelines can help you maintain proper hydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink about 17 to 20 ounces of water 2 to 3 hours before exercising.
- Sip on 8 ounces of water 20 to 30 minutes before your workout.
- During exercise, aim to consume 7 to 10 ounces of water every 10 to 20 minutes.
- After working out, drink 8 ounces of water within 30 minutes, and continue to hydrate based on your thirst levels.

### The Role of Electrolytes

Water isn't the only component of effective hydration. Your body also loses electrolytes — such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium — through sweat. Replenishing these electrolytes is especially important during long or intense workouts. Here’s how they contribute:

- **Maintain fluid balance:** Electrolytes help regulate fluid balance in and out of cells, which is crucial during exercise.
- **Aid muscle function:** Proper electrolyte levels are essential for muscle contractions and preventing cramps.
- **Support nerve function:** Electrolytes transmit electrical signals, which are crucial for muscle control and coordination.

Sports drinks can be beneficial for restoring electrolytes after strenuous activities, but it's important to choose options that are low in sugar and additives.

### Strategies for Improving Hydration

Improving your hydration habits can be simple. Here are some effective strategies:

- **Carry a water bottle:** Keep a reusable bottle with you to make sipping on water easy throughout the day.
- **Set reminders:** Use phone apps or alarms to remind you to drink regularly.
- **Track your intake:** Consider using a hydration app to monitor how much water you’re consuming.

Common Myths About Daily Water Intake Debunked
----------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, many of us have heard various tips and tricks about how much water we should drink each day. However, some of these suggestions are more myth than fact. Let’s explore some common misconceptions about daily water intake, helping you to make informed choices about your hydration needs.

### Myth 1: You Need Eight Glasses of Water a Day

The idea that everyone needs to drink eight glasses of water each day is more of a guideline than an absolute rule. While water is essential for health, individual requirements vary based on factors like age, activity level, and climate. In fact, the National Academies of Sciences suggests about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) for men and 2.7 liters (91 ounces) for women, which includes all beverages and foods consumed.

### Myth 2: You Only Need Water When You're Thirsty

Some believe that as long as you drink when thirsty, your body is properly hydrated. While thirst is a useful signal, waiting for it might not be the best strategy. Thirst can sometimes lag behind your body’s actual needs. To stay well-hydrated, consider sipping water throughout the day even when you don’t feel thirsty.

### Myth 3: Coffee and Tea Dehydrate You

Another common myth is that beverages like coffee and tea dehydrate you. While caffeine can have a mild diuretic effect, studies show that the hydration provided by these drinks often outweighs any potential dehydrating impact. In moderation, both coffee and tea can contribute positively to your daily fluid intake.

### Myth 4: You Should Drink More Water in Hot Weather Alone

While it's true that you might need more fluids in hot weather, don’t ignore your hydration needs in cooler months. Your body still loses water through processes like breathing and sweating, regardless of temperature. Staying hydrated all year round is essential for overall health, so be mindful of your water intake no matter the season.

### Myth 5: Drinking Water Can Help You Lose Weight

Many believe that drinking water helps with weight loss. While hydration is important for metabolism and can help curb hunger, it’s not a standalone solution for shedding pounds. An overall approach including balanced nutrition and physical activity is essential for effective weight management.

### Myth 6: All Fluids Count as Hydration

Every beverage you consume contributes to hydration, right? While it’s true that fluids count towards your daily intake, not all beverages are created equal. Drinks high in sugar or caffeine can have negative effects. Opting for water, herbal teas, and other low-calorie beverages is a better way to stay hydrated without additional calories or effects that higher-sugar drinks might trigger.

### Myth 7: You Can Overhydrate

While being adequately hydrated is crucial, excessive water intake can lead to a condition known as hyponatremia, or ""water intoxication."" This occurs when sodium levels in your body get too low due to excessive water consumption. It’s rare, but it reinforces the idea that balance is key. Listen to your body and seek hydration in a responsible manner.

### Myth 8: Hydration is Only Important During Exercise

Many individuals think that hydration is only a concern when exercising. However, staying well-hydrated throughout the day is vital for maintaining overall body function. Proper hydration supports everything from digestion to joint health. Make drinking water a daily habit, not just a pre- and post-workout routine.

Knowing the facts about hydration can help you make better decisions about how to drink water daily. By debunking these myths, you can find a balanced approach to your daily water intake that works best for you. Remember, the best way to determine your hydration needs is to listen to your body and adjust according to your lifestyle and environmental factors.

Understanding the Effects of Dehydration on Your Health
-------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for every function in the body. It makes up about 60% of our body weight. When you don’t drink enough water, your body can become dehydrated. This can lead to serious health issues. Understanding the effects of dehydration on your health is crucial for maintaining overall well-being.

### What is Dehydration?

Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in. This can happen for several reasons, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Excessive sweating, especially during physical activities
- Not drinking enough water throughout the day
- Illnesses that cause vomiting or diarrhea
- Hot weather conditions that increase moisture loss

Even mild dehydration can affect your body and mind. Recognizing the signs of dehydration is the first step toward prevention.

### Signs and Symptoms of Dehydration

Dehydration can manifest in various ways. Here are some common symptoms to look out for:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Thirst: Your body’s first signal that it needs water.
- Dry mouth and throat, along with chapped lips.
- Fatigue or dizziness, especially when standing up quickly.
- Less frequent urination or darker urine than usual.
- Headaches or difficulty concentrating.

If you notice any of these symptoms, it’s vital to drink water promptly to restore your fluids.

Drinking enough water can help you perform at your best during workouts or daily activities.

### Impact on Mental Health

To keep both your body and mind sharp, make hydration a priority.

### Long-Term Health Consequences

Chronic dehydration can lead to severe health problems. Over time, not drinking enough water can contribute to:

- Kidney stones: Insufficient hydration increases the risk of mineral accumulation.
- Urinary tract infections: Dehydration can lead to more concentrated urine, making infection more likely.
- Digestive issues: Water aids in digestion, and a lack of it can cause constipation.

By staying hydrated, you can help prevent these long-term health issues.

### How Much Water Do You Need?

The amount of water you need varies by individual factors like age, gender, physical activity level, and climate. A common rule of thumb is to aim for about eight 8-ounce glasses a day, but remember that needs can vary widely. You can also hydrate by consuming fruits and vegetables, which have high water content.

- Flavor your water: Add lemon or cucumber slices for a refreshing taste that makes you want to drink more.
- Eat water-rich foods: Include fruits like watermelon and vegetables like cucumbers in your diet.

By being mindful of your hydration, you’ll support your health both physically and mentally.

Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated Throughout the Day
------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall well-being, but sometimes it can feel like a challenge to drink enough water throughout the day. Here are practical tips to make hydration easier and more enjoyable, ensuring that you’re getting your daily dose of water without feeling overwhelmed.

### Set Clear Goals

Setting a specific goal for your water intake can provide a clear target to aim for.

### Carry a Reusable Water Bottle

Keep a reusable water bottle with you wherever you go. This simple act makes it more convenient to sip water throughout your day. Opt for a bottle that holds at least 16 ounces, so you can track how many refills you need for that ultimate hydration goal. With a water bottle by your side, you’ll be more likely to remember to drink.

### Use Reminders

Sometimes, busy schedules can cause you to forget to drink enough water. Set reminders on your phone or use an app that pings you at regular intervals. These gentle nudges can help keep hydration at the forefront of your mind.

### Infuse Your Water

If plain water doesn’t excite you, try infusing it with fresh fruits, herbs, or vegetables. Here are some tasty combinations:

- Strawberry and basil
- Cucumber and lemon
- Mint and lime
- Orange and rosemary

These infusions add flavor and encourage you to drink more. Plus, they can provide added health benefits from the nutrients in the fruits and herbs.

### Hydrate with Food

Your hydration doesn’t only come from drinking liquids. Many fruits and vegetables have high water content and can contribute to your daily intake. Consider including these options in your meals:

- Watermelon
- Cucumber
- Zucchini
- Oranges
- Strawberries

These hydrating foods into your diet is an easy way to boost your overall water consumption.

### Drink Before Meals

An effective strategy is to drink a glass of water before each meal. Not only does this help you remember to hydrate, but it can also aid digestion. Drinking water before a meal can also help control appetite, making it easier to manage weight.

### Set Specific Drinking Times

Drinking water can become a habit if you establish specific times throughout the day to enjoy it. For instance, aim to drink a glass of water every hour or right after you wake up and before going to bed. Customizing these intervals to fit your schedule will make hydration feel less like a chore.

Challenges can add a fun twist to hydration! You can invite friends or family members to join you in a hydration challenge and track your progress together. You could even create friendly competitions to see who can drink the most water in a week. Engaging with others can boost your motivation and accountability.

### Make It a Habit

Creating a habit takes time, so try to incorporate these tips into your daily routine gradually. Be patient with yourself; start small and slowly increase your water intake as you become more comfortable with drinking regularly. Establishing good habits will make hydration feel natural in no time.

Science points to hydration as a key factor in enhancing physical performance and aiding recovery. By debunking common myths about daily water intake, it becomes clear that individual hydration needs can vary greatly depending on factors like activity level, climate, and personal health.

After passing the local boards and trying out available options to practice here in the PH, I tried my luck and took step 1 last month.

Dry or Wet?,"Background - Am still fairly new to the espresso-making world and, in process of dialing in a new coffee, I've been using the bottom paper filters (dry) since I first got my machine and all my accessories. While having some small dialing-in challenges and experimenting/adjusting my puck prep technique to try to alleviate, I just started wetting the bottom paper filter and I noticed a (dramatic) increase in shot times.

In fact the first time I did it (without changing anything else in my process), it was so bad I somehow managed to choke the machine for the first time ever (barely a few drips coming out after like 30 seconds), even though this was the same finest grind size which I did experiment with before with dry paper filters (but was just getting inconsistent results before).

Upping the grind size, while still wetting the filter paper, I noticed the shot times with wet paper filter come out much much longer/slower than any of my previous dry filter attempts on the same grind size (albeit it seems like the extraction does appear to be more even throughout the puck when it first comes out).

The question is - Since there appears to be such a massive difference in my experience, (and I could commit to one or the other and just redial from there - but would just like know which is the right approach before I go down that route), for those of you who use bottom paper filters, what is the latest consensus on how we should properly use them? Should we keep them always dry no matter what, or prewet them before placing into the basket? What has been your experience?

Any additional tips, info, or input would be much appreciated.

I want to open a cat café in Enschede – but I need your help!

Enschede has plenty of cozy spots, but it’s missing something: a place where you can relax with a cup of coffee and a cuddly cat on your lap. That’s why I want to open a cat café – a warm, welcoming space for both people and cats.

Why a cat café?

For the people:
Many students live in housing where pets aren’t allowed. A cat café gives them a chance to enjoy the comfort of feline companionship. We also aim to create jobs, especially for people with fewer opportunities in the job market. For example, individuals with autism, who often have a natural bond with animals, can gain confidence in a safe, supportive environment.

For the cats:
Our focus will be on shelter cats – the ones often overlooked. The cat with a missing eye or the bonded pair that can’t be separated – they’ll find a loving home with us.


What to expect:
A cozy atmosphere with delicious coffee, tea, homemade treats like vegan paninis, smoothies, and more. While you enjoy your drink, you can cuddle with our cats and unwind.

I launched a crowdfunding campaign yesterday to make this dream a reality. The goal? To open The Enchanted Cat (working title) this summer – Enschede’s very first cat café.

What do you think of this idea? I’d love to hear your thoughts! 😊

Enschede has plenty of cozy spots, but it’s missing something: a place where you can relax with a cup of coffee and a cuddly cat on your lap. That’s why I want to open a cat café – a warm, welcoming space for both people and cats.

Why a cat café?

For the people:
Many students live in housing where pets aren’t allowed. A cat café gives them a chance to enjoy the comfort of feline companionship. We also aim to create jobs, especially for people with fewer opportunities in the job market. For example, individuals with autism, who often have a natural bond with animals, can gain confidence in a safe, supportive environment.

For the cats:
Our focus will be on shelter cats – the ones often overlooked. The cat with a missing eye or the bonded pair that can’t be separated – they’ll find a loving home with us.


What to expect:
A cozy atmosphere with delicious coffee, tea, homemade treats like vegan paninis, smoothies, and more. While you enjoy your drink, you can cuddle with our cats and unwind.

I launched a crowdfunding campaign yesterday to make this dream a reality. The goal? To open The Enchanted Cat (working title) this summer – Enschede’s very first cat café.

What do you think of this idea? I’d love to hear your thoughts! 😊

***Photo above*** *- Otis elevator operators in 1945. Starbucks' baristas in 2024.*  
  
I interviewed a guy for a job, a few years ago. His resume said “barista” for his current job. I had to ask – what in the world is that?  
  
*“I pour coffee at Starbucks”.*  
  
I never blinked an eye. This kid was the boss’s son applying for a job. I was evidently only conducting the interview to avoid any appearance of nepotism. We were a financial and software company. The boy knew something about Java, but not our kind. Junior had finally listened to dad and ended a bad 3 year career decision called barista. *“You’re hired!”* (Actually, HR made that call.)  
  
The Starbucks’ strike in the link below is about wages and benefits, of course. For a part time job pouring coffee to go, for commuters. The dream is to be able to support a family of 4 decently on a job like this. Or take regular European vacations. The reality is that will never happen. Evidently baristas were unimpressed with the campaign position of both Kamala and Trump – to end income taxes on tips. Their existential problem remained . . . baristas are stuck in a job with no potential for advancement. At least Amazon provides pickers and drivers free part time college tuition, and they can give programming a shot. Rumor has it that some guy actually made it, and tripled his Amazon salary. Theres an advert to this effect on basic Spotify.  
  
Elevator operators found themselves in position similar to baristas after World War 2. A job with no potential for advancement. “Strike!”  
  
In the case of the elevator operators, their action triggered an immediate and irreversible transition to self-service elevators. (see link below). Evidently the elevator operators had a misconception that office and apartment buildings would have to replace an entire elevator to make it self service. In fact, only that weird half-moon shaped hand throttle, like they use on battleships, needed to go. Just put in a few buttons and a chime.  
  
Just so you know, I am NOT rooting for baristas to get replaced by buttons and chimes. But Starbucks is already sucking it. Wait times are as long as 30 minutes for service. Prices are through the roof. Baristas write insulting nicknames on cups when your order is finally ready. Drinks are poured improperly. And Starbucks is already in the process of “simplifying” its menu, because baristas are challenged with mixtures involving java, syrup, cream, and sugar. Repeat: I do NOT want baristas to get fired en-masse. But those who cannot remember history are likely to repeat it.  
  
Just ask your granny, if she was ever an elevator operator.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

I'm fully aware my morning routine is bad. So many nights I have been super motivated to do something differently, but then I wake up and do the exact same morning routine.

**Here's my morning routine:** 

**1. Wake up easily to my alarm (never have problems waking up)**

**2. Make myself a coffee**

**3. Have a coffee and a vape while watching gaming videos**

**4. Do that until I need to poo (I can't leave the house if I don't, IBS/anxiety)**

**5. Then have a shower and get ready for the day or go to the gym (every other day)**

  
**My problem with this:**

\- Often times my brain is so drained from watching all the videos for an hour, that I can't get myself to start working

\- I work for myself, as a freelancer and often lose motivation to work after lunchtime.

\- I know my mornings could be so much better. Not productivity-wise, but setting myself up for the day, so I don't feel unmotivated throughout some days.

There's been a few mornings (literally 2) that I didn't do my usual routine and it did feel great, but I struggle to repeat that.

I was a barista for 4 years in a retail chain (UK) that was constantly understaffed and paid minimum wage. I left earlier this year, struggled to find another job, and eventually ended up getting employed by another chain coffee shop because I needed the money. It's slightly better with staffing and workload, but it's insanely busy and I'm working 10+ hour shifts with a 30 min unpaid break, and frequent 5am starts or 10pm finishes which affect my social life. My schedule is inconsistent. Same minimum wage pay. I feel consistently emotionally and physically drained. I desperately want out of retail/hospitality.

I have a postgraduate degree in a humanities subject, studied because the research area is my passion, and I am applying for doctoral studentships to get back into academia. This comes with its own set of struggles, but I find I don't mind the grind as much because it's working towards something I want. In the past year I have applied to jobs in museums, libraries, archives, editing, research, and heritage with no luck. Currently searching to volunteer in one of these areas to get relevant experience.

My main question is: genuinely, how do you all keep going? How do you show up every day when you know that your work is just insignificant, low-paying capitalist drivel? How can I escape retail/hospitality? I can't seem to disconnect my mental/emotional health from my job. It's a struggle to show up to a place that takes so much and gives so little back.

The alternative I’m considering is the VertuoPlus which is a bestseller but it doesn’t have the expert mode and instead comes with a CA Prop 65 warning (I’m a cancer researcher so I do pause for these. Yes, I know coffee has acrylamides but I’m choosing that delectable poison in small doses over others). It also has less power than the Pop+ so the coffee wouldn’t be as hot.

In 2023 they hired subcontractors for their busy season (winter) so I gave the tip to them. 
In 2024, they have expanded even more, and now they have several subcontractors and we never know who we will get. The original husband & wife team also will still do cleaning. I never tip the subcontractors for each cleaning because I never tipped the owners, the price stayed the same (actually increased due to cost of living) and I never know who I’m going to get until after the fact - I work from home so I typically take my dog to daycare after I bring my daughter to daycare and I work from a local coffee shop until the owners text that they have finished. I’ve only interacted with the subcontractors on my busy workdays where I work from my home office until they arrive. I’m not sure how to handle the tip this year. Any advice?

She does the grocery shopping, the house shopping, the decorating, making breakfast, and fake laughing at his cringy self because she has no other way of tricking people into thinking the relationship is fulfilling. The forced laughter is awkward. Juan is a master manipulator. They deserve each other - they can’t do better.

Not because I didn’t want one, but because I was simply unable to keep a plant alive. I had succulents, yucca, coffee plants, even a tiny redwood tree.. and I killed them all. So I gave up - plants just weren’t for me, apparently. Then, about 3 years ago, I saw this little dracaena fragrans - and I fell head over heels in love with it, and I took it home. That dracaena changed everything - I slowly learned how to care for her, then adopted more plants. Now I have 12, they are all doing well - and my dracaena fragrans, the one that started it all, is still going strong. I’m so happy with it ❤️

1hh0oab,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hh0oab,Tokyo- Florilège (unusual dining experience) ,"Florilège is one of the dream fine dining destinations on my list when visiting Tokyo. Like others I went on their website one month in advance and managed to reserve two seats for our Tokyo trip this Dec. However, the overall dining experience fell short after the main dish (and if anyone knows why Florilège decides to serve their mains this way I would love to know) 

The restaurant is located in the new Azabudai Hills, and the setting is a huge communal style table where about 20+ people sit around the table and the chef is surrounded in the open kitchen in the middle. 

Their alcohol and non-alcohol pairing are priced reasonably, my wife and I were equally impressed with their pairing selections. There were about six pairings from start to main, and coffee/tea for dessert. 

The starters and appetizers were creative and very flavorful, focused on using seasonal vegetables including daikon, tomatoes, lotus roots, etc.

However, the dining experience took a turn when they started to serve the main dish. 

Our reservation was at 18:30pm, I believe there was an earlier round that started at around 18:00pm. There were two Japanese couple sitting across from us, and a few guests dine solo that started before us. When it was time to take photos of the main dish for the first round guests, the chef presented a plate with what looked like a huge rack of venison rib steak (we also see the chef basting the rack of ribs in butter during the preparation). However, when it was our time to take photos of the main, the chef showed us a pot with stewed oxtails in it. I mustve really enjoyed the appetizers and didn’t realize at that point we would have different mains, but turned out about 10+ people who ate one dish earlier than us had venison steak for mains, and we were served with a plate of stewed oxtail. 

Once realized we were served different mains, I was very confused and didn’t care much about the oxtail (I would argue if you spent the same at the restaurant, most people would choose steak over beef stew). This was a very odd experience, and I don’t think I have ever been in a fine dining restaurant with set menu that serves different mains. By the way, there wasn’t an option to choose the mains, it was assigned. 

Later when deserts were served, I did ask the waiter if they had different menus, and the explanation did not make much sense. So I didn’t bother to ask for more details. 

In hindsight, the experience would be different if we didn’t know what other guests were being served for mains, but when you saw other people were having steak first, then you were served with beef stew, it was a quite a let down….

To this day I still cannot find an explanation to explain why a two star Michelin restaurant would arrange two different mains, even though we paid the same for the same dinner set menu. Venison steak at that point seemed like a far superior choice for mains. 

Side note: Florilège presented the menu after the service, and while each dish is highlighted with the main ingredient used, the mains was conveniently noted as “To Balance”…",10,1734525501.0,finedining,17,0.75,False
1hh0mrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1hh0mrc/caffeine_sensitivity_causing_increased_anxiety/,Caffeine sensitivity causing increased anxiety???,"I’m currently 32w pregnant with my 2nd son. I absolutely have generalized anxiety, and during my pregnancies/postpartum I tend to experience relatively manageable anxiety/OCD.  

There were about 2 weeks earlier in my third trimester that I didn’t drink coffee/caffeine at all, just didn’t sound good. Fast forward to right about my 31 week mark, I woke up with a panic attack in the middle of the night, and have had absolutely crippling anxiety since then. Like inescapable spiraling since my panic attack.

This morning as I was about to pour my morning coffee, I had a revelation - I started drinking coffee again right before my anxiety went INSANE. Ive always drank a reasonable amount of caffeine, but I’m wondering if I’m just super sensitive to even a cup of coffee during pregnancy??? Has anyone else experienced caffeine-related anxiety/sensitivity during pregnancy?

I am on the brink of asking my doctor for anxiety meds, but I really don’t want to go on it if it is truly just the caffeine! TYIA!",3,1734525349.0,BabyBumps,5,1.0,False

Context: I had an ectopic back in August, thankfully resolved with expectant management. This has been my only pregnancy. Before getting a positive test (dr caught it at a baseline ultrasound appt, 2 days into my period, which was the flag that something was wrong), the only weird change I had noticed in my body was ~3-4 nights of AWFUL sleep right around the time of implantation. It felt like I had chugged a pot of coffee right before bed and my brain just wouldn’t let me go to sleep. I haven’t had this issue since.

We’re still trying and I’m currently in the implantation window. Just had my second night of similar awful sleep and I’m freaking out a bit that it may be another ectopic. Trying to stay calm though!",1,1734525054.0,EctopicSupportGroup,0,1.0,False

I,"My gf and I live together. She has a dog, so I guess the dog is pretty much mine now too. He’s a sweet soul. Very well behaved. But unbelievably needy. 

He sleeps with us in the bed, he’s allowed on all the furniture, he follows us to the bathroom when we’re showering... He’s never more than 30cm away from us at any time. 

I feel like he has no boundaries. But that’s how things were before I moved in with my gf and I knew all about it. So I tolerate it even if he annoys me sometimes. 

But one thing I absolutely can’t tolerate is that he sits with us when we eat. We often eat while sitting on the couch in front of the TV, we have a coffee table in front of the couch. And the dog jumps up on the couch next to us and just stares with an almighty intensity at our food. Sometimes making slurpy/smacking noises and breathing really loudly (he’s a French bulldog). For the record he never tries to take the food. It’s just the staring and the noises that bother me. And the close proximity. It absolutely enrages me. 

I told my gf a few times I can’t have him or any other animal sitting at the table with my while I eat. He has to be on the floor. 

She was ok with that, but then it immediately happens again and again and she doesn’t seem to bother about it. It totally doesn’t bother her at all 

I can’t escape the feeling of being a bit of an asshole. Because I can’t explain why it bothers me so much. I feel like I’m being irrational. I just think he needs some sort of boundary. I’d like to be able to explain this better to my partner so she understands where I’m coming from and treats it more seriously.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s digital landscape, connecting with your audience is more important than ever. Whether you are a blogger, a vlogger, or an online writer, fostering engagement can not only build loyalty but also enhance your content reach. Here are some effective strategies to create and maintain a lively interaction with your readers or viewers.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Create Valuable Content

Provide content that solves problems, entertains, or educates. When your audience finds value in what you create, they are more likely to share it. Ask yourself:

- What problems do they face that my content could help solve?
- How can I make my content more enjoyable or informative?

The more relevant your content is, the better the engagement you will see.

### Encourage Interaction

Ask questions at the end of your posts or videos to initiate discussion. Encouraging comments not only creates a sense of community but also provides you with feedback. You may use prompts such as:

- What do you think about this topic?
- Have you ever experienced something similar?
- What are your suggestions for future content?

Engaging your audience in a dialogue makes them feel valued and more connected to your work.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Utilize Social Media

Social media is a powerful tool for increasing interaction. Share your content on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where your audience hangs out. Each platform offers unique opportunities for engagement:

- **Facebook:** Create groups related to your niche to foster community.
- **Instagram:** Use polls and question stickers in Stories to gather feedback.
- **Twitter:** Start conversations by utilizing trending hashtags.

Each interaction on social media can lead your audience back to your content, which enhances its visibility.

- Exclusive content or early access to articles/videos.
- Personalized recommendations based on their interests.

Consistency breeds trust. By sticking to a regular content schedule, your audience knows when to expect new material. This helps maintain interest and anticipation. Consider setting a specific day and time for your blog posts or video uploads, and stick to it, allowing your audience to integrate your content into their routines.

### Respond to Feedback

Your audience’s responses, whether positive or negative, are valuable. Take the time to reply to comments on your blog or social media posts. Acknowledging their thoughts shows you value their input and helps build trust. Additionally, when you use feedback to adjust your future content, it demonstrates that you listen and care about your audience's opinions.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive

- Which topics generate the most comments?
- Are there specific formats (videos vs. articles) that attract more viewers?
- What times do your posts receive the most engagement?

Use this analysis to refine your strategies, ensuring that you continue to meet your audience's evolving needs.

The most common method of monetization is through advertisements. Many platforms allow creators to incorporate ads within their content. You can join programs like Google AdSense, which displays ads relevant to your audience. Every time someone clicks on an ad, you earn money. This passive income stream can be quite lucrative, especially if you have high traffic on your site or video channel.

Another lucrative option is affiliate marketing. By promoting products or services through special links, you earn a commission for every sale made through your referral. Here’s how to get started with affiliate marketing:

- Choose a niche that aligns with your content.
- Join popular affiliate programs, like Amazon Associates or ShareASale.
- Embed affiliate links in your blog posts, social media platforms, or video descriptions.
- Write reviews or create tutorials that naturally incorporate those products.

You can also offer sponsored content. Brands pay you to create content that features their products or services. This method is effective because it aligns with the interests of your audience. Make sure to disclose sponsorships to maintain trust with your followers.

Another strategy is to create premium content. You can develop exclusive content available only through a paid subscription. Platforms like Patreon allow your audience to support you financially in exchange for additional perks, such as behind-the-scenes content, early access to videos, or exclusive live chats. This not only generates income but also builds a deeper connection with your most dedicated fans.

Digital products are another excellent way to monetize your skills. You can create and sell items like eBooks, online courses, or printables. This allows you to leverage your expertise in a specific area. Here are some steps to effectively sell digital products:

- Identify your audience's needs and interests.
- Create a high-quality product that addresses those needs.
- Market your product through your existing content platforms.
- Utilize email marketing to promote sales and updates.

Remember about donations and crowdfunding. Many creators use platforms like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee, where fans can donate to support their work. This method works particularly well for creators who produce content that resonates deeply with their audience, allowing them to show appreciation for your hard work.

Vlogging, in particular, has its unique monetization pathways. YouTube, for instance, has its Partner Program that allows you to earn money from ads on your videos. To qualify, you need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours within the last twelve months. Think of creative content that can draw in and engage viewers.

When it comes to writing blogs, leveraging SEO can help increase your visibility. By optimizing your content for search engines, you attract more visitors to your site. Use keywords wisely, create engaging titles, and make sure to provide value to your readers. The more traffic your blog receives, the more opportunities you have for monetization.

The methods of monetizing your content are diverse and plentiful. From ads to affiliate marketing and beyond, each strategy has its strengths. You must find the combination that best suits your style and audience. Start exploring these options today and turn your passion for content into a profitable venture.

We are now looking at two full-length ballets in 24 that had few to no debuts in Principal parts, despite multiple performances. I'm sorry but Coffee doesn't count. While its lovely for dancers who've been with the company for 20 years to still be able to perform well or adequately multiple times per week, in order for the company to progress, there has to be some balance. Under Peter, seniors maybe performed 1-2 times per week on average with the exception of Kyra and then later Wendy Whalen.

While it has been deeply frustrating coming to terms with the reality that it’s a very real bad dream, life is much sweeter and fuller. 
•Instant 10% ++ richer. Can pay all my bills in full on time, feed my family and share with others. 
•7x days a week are all mine, no more ridiculous youth nights, Mormon taxis, Wars Council meetings, etc. All mine and my families. More time with my family and being present. 
•Alcohol, in moderation, yes please. 
•Coffee, where have you been all my life.
•Friendships instantly tested and the ones who stayed are there because they genuinely care and are not assigned or called to friendships.
•Marriage / intimacy, more honest, forgiving and no more “special clothing” getting in the way. 
•More forgiving and patient with all my children, giving them moral guidelines and actually let them govern themselves. Forgiving of their errors in judgement and letting them touch the flames of mistakes and letting them learn for themselves rather than a purity or total avoidance culture - Less judgement of others and appreciating people where they are at. 
•More forgiving of myself and others. 
•Eternity will take care of itself, I live purposefully today intend on doing good and being good on my terms and as opportunity presents. 

Yes there are still deep and difficult challenges, like loss of multi generational community and with that a Mormon “identity”. Loss of immediate family connection and familial resonance (tough) but my wife and children are close and we are more real and present with each other. 
A new life of discovery, evolving identity, reimagining of self, desires and dreams is by far still a wonderful exciting challenge and a path of deep satisfaction.

This environment, this product, is a shitshow. Pure ops. I have been trying my hardest to cobble together as many Temporal workflows as possible to automate my involvement, but the larger business has put roadblocks in place that will take months to clear.

So for now, I have to help manually deploy parts of this service. I then hand it over to the other teams who work on config and everything else.

Part of the QA was testing this config process. Reconfigure, remove settings, whatever. Basic QA stuff.

They broke it. It stopped working. They reached out to the software vendor, who ultimately told me I need to look at the logs and figure it out. I don't own the data involved in this, I don't understand why people configure it the way they do, if I did I wouldn't be an SRE, that's not my job. Yet here I am, responsible for cleaning up the environment (manually) every time QA breaks it and the vendor throws up their hands because ""you shouldn't have done that"". This time, they told me I should trawl through the audit logs to see what behaviour might have caused it. I don't even have access to the actual app or system logs, since their service is ""cloud"" (despite requiring a Windows-based heavy client), so all I can do is look up user audit logs to see ""X user did <generic action>"". These are non-technical actions - think scheduling an ad campaign. Even looking at the audit logs, why do I need to care that someones scheduling is wrong? Why am I even here. What did I do to deserve this.

The product itself only runs on Windows (so it's a virtual desktop or VM required to do anything), and their publicly documented solution for regular & well known bugs leading to memory leaks is to simply ""reboot the server daily"". I wish I was joking.

The vendor offers API documentation but absolutely no effort in actually implementing anything that would resemble modern-day automation. Ever get nostalgic for 2002 Java apps? Boy do I have some great news for you. I have essentially been building a framework around their API over the last 2 months, purely so I never have to look at their bullshit heavy client in my stupid Windows VM ever again. However as mentioned, there are business blockers in the way that mean the foreseeable future here will be clickops for teams who can't do their own jobs.

There is no product owner on our end btw. My manager, when he was an engineer, ended up trying to be helpful and so hacked together a bunch of stuff that does the work of the other teams for them. This has come back to haunt us, in that they now do not know how to do large parts of their own jobs and expect us to fix everything for them.

I cannot dedicate my life to fixing QA fuckups via clickops. I would rather work in a coffee shop.

How the fuck do I approach this without burning bridges? My manager is off work until after the new year and a bunch of senior managers are asking me why I've taken so long to respond to their emails about fixing mistakes their teams made.",5,1734524048.0,sre,5,0.78,False

Enschede has plenty of cozy spots, but it’s missing something: a place where you can relax with a cup of coffee and a cuddly cat on your lap. That’s why I want to open a cat café – a warm, welcoming space for both people and cats.

Why a cat café?

For the people:
Many students live in housing where pets aren’t allowed. A cat café gives them a chance to enjoy the comfort of feline companionship. We also aim to create jobs, especially for people with fewer opportunities in the job market. For example, individuals with autism, who often have a natural bond with animals, can gain confidence in a safe, supportive environment.

For the cats:
Our focus will be on shelter cats – the ones often overlooked. The cat with a missing eye or the bonded pair that can’t be separated – they’ll find a loving home with us.


What to expect:
A cozy atmosphere with delicious coffee, tea, homemade treats like vegan paninis, smoothies, and more. While you enjoy your drink, you can cuddle with our cats and unwind.

I launched a crowdfunding campaign yesterday to make this dream a reality. The goal? To open The Enchanted Cat (working title) this summer – Enschede’s very first cat café.

What do you think of this idea? I’d love to hear your thoughts! 😊
