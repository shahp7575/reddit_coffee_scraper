It hit me... I've been rushing through my mornings without really savoring them. I mean, mornings set the tone for the whole day, right?

The peace and simplicity of just sitting there got me thinking about how much I miss these moments when I dive right into my phone or start worrying about the to-do list. So, I've decided that from now on, I'm gonna give myself a little more time each morning to relax and actually enjoy my coffee without distractions.

Chapter 1  
  
Brooklyn Sheridan had been the Sheridan family's beloved princess for twenty years—until the real daughter showed up at their doorstep with a DNA test.  
  
That's when she discovered she was nothing but a switched-at-birth fraud.  
  
Humiliated, she packed her bags to leave. But on her last night in the mansion, Kaiden Sheridan carried her to his car.  
  
The brother who'd been cold and distant her whole life pressed her against the leather seats and made her come three times.  
  
Her voice was raw from crying out when he gripped her waist, whispering over and over in her ear: ""I've wanted to fuck you for so damn long.""  
  
In that moment, she finally understood—all those years of coldness had been nothing but self-control.  
  
Soon after, he announced their engagement. No one could talk him out of it.  
  
When their parents objected, he stripped them of power and took complete control of the Sheridan empire.  
  
When the real daughter threw her tantrums, he cut off all her credit cards and threatened to ship her back to whatever trailer park she came from.  
  
Brooklyn couldn't accept being with the brother she'd grown up with. She tried to run countless times, but he always dragged her back.  
  
He had her completely trapped—nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.  
  
Until two weeks ago, when he crashed his Porsche racing through downtown at midnight to get her favorite cheesecake from that 24-hour bakery.  
  
When he woke up... he remembered nothing.  
  
The Sheridan family was overjoyed. When they introduced Brooklyn, they didn't mention she was the woman he'd obsessed over—they simply called her the nanny.  
  
Now they wanted her gone while Kaiden's memory was wiped clean.  
  
""This is a hundred million dollars.""  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan shoved the check across the mahogany table. ""Kaiden doesn't remember you exist right now. Take this money and disappear. We raised you for twenty years—consider this our final favor. Never show your face around him again, and make damn sure he never finds you.""  
  
After what felt like forever, Brooklyn finally spoke.  
  
""Fine. I'll have all my immigration paperwork done within two weeks. I'll never come back to the States.""  
  
She picked up the check, her hands trembling slightly. This whole year felt like some twisted nightmare.  
  
They wanted her gone. And honestly? She wanted to leave too.  
  
Sure, Kaiden had spoiled her rotten this past year—designer clothes, jewelry worth more than most people's houses, vacations to private islands. But this kind of possessive, stolen love was suffocating her.  
  
He never gave me a choice, she thought bitterly. Just took what he wanted, like everything else.  
  
With his amnesia, this was her only shot at freedom.  
  
""What the hell is going on here?""  
  
The front door slammed open. Kaiden stood in the entryway with Alina Sheridan trailing behind him.  
  
He looked every inch the billionaire CEO—tailored Tom Ford suit, perfectly styled dark hair, that commanding presence that made board rooms go silent. Even now, with no memory of who she was, he still made her heart race.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan's faces went white. They plastered on fake smiles. ""Oh, nothing at all! Just going over some household stuff with the nanny.""  
  
Mrs. Sheridan elbowed her husband. ""We were just heading upstairs for our afternoon nap.""  
  
Before leaving, she shot Brooklyn a look that could kill—keep your mouth shut.  
  
Brooklyn stared at the floor, clutching the check so hard her knuckles went white. She started toward the servants' staircase when—  
  
""Stop.""  
  
Kaiden's voice could freeze hell over.  
  
She froze mid-step, not daring to look up. Her heart was hammering so loud she was sure he could hear it.  
  
His Italian leather shoes clicked against the marble as he approached. Then his fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes—those same dark eyes that used to look at her like she was his entire world.  
  
God, he's still so beautiful, she thought helplessly. Even now, when he looks at me like I'm nothing.  
  
Her breathing hitched as memories flooded back—him pressing her against the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse office, bending her over his desk after board meetings, taking her on the hood of his car in their private garage.  
  
His thumb traced her jawline, those familiar calluses sending shivers down her spine. ""What's that perfume you're wearing?""  
  
Brooklyn opened her mouth to answer—  
  
""Don't wear it again."" He dropped his hand like she'd burned him. ""Nannies should stick to changing diapers and making bottles. Don't try to seduce anyone in this house.""  
  
Her chest tightened painfully.  
  
Before, he used to bury his face in my neck and breathe me in like I was oxygen. 'You smell incredible, baby,' he'd whisper. 'Like vanilla and something that's just... you. Drives me fucking crazy.'  
  
'I'm not wearing any perfume,' I'd tell him.  
  
'Then it's just you. Every part of you was made for me, Brooklyn. You're never leaving me. I'll hunt you down wherever you go.'  
  
She'd believed him then. Thought she'd never escape.  
  
But now he doesn't even remember my name.  
  
Brooklyn swallowed the lump in her throat. ""Understood, Mr. Sheridan.""  
  
She watched him disappear into his study, then finally let herself breathe. She was turning to go pack when Alina suddenly appeared and slapped her across the face so hard her ears rang.  
  
""You pathetic little bitch!"" Alina shrieked. ""Even with my brother's memory completely gone, you're still trying to sink your claws into him!""  
  
Jesus, that hurt. Brooklyn's cheek burned, but she didn't touch it. Wouldn't give Alina the satisfaction.  
  
""Well, guess what, trailer trash? My brother's got a real fiancée now!"" Alina's smile was vicious. ""The engagement announcement's going out next week. Some sophisticated woman from a proper family—not some charity case who doesn't know her real daddy.""  
  
Brooklyn's stomach dropped.  
  
A fiancée. Of course. He's Kaiden fucking Sheridan—heir to a billion-dollar empire. Of course they'd line up suitable wives the second he was available again.  
  
Not that it matters. I'm leaving anyway.  
  
But Alina wasn't done. ""Guards! Grab this slut! Throw her in the cold storage! Let her freeze her ass off and think about what happens when you try to seduce my brother!""  
  
The bodyguards looked at each other nervously. Nobody moved.  
  
They all remembered what happened to the last guy who'd touched Brooklyn—some senator's son at a charity gala. He'd grabbed her waist for a photo. The next morning, his hand was delivered to his father's office in a Tiffany box.  
  
Alina's face turned red. ""My brother has amnesia! She's just the fucking nanny now! What are you scared of?!""  
  
She pointed at the head of security. ""If you don't arrest her right now, I'll have you all fired!""  
  
The guards still hesitated.  
  
Then the study door flew open.  
  
Kaiden stepped out, his jaw tight with irritation. ""What's all this screaming about?""  
  
Alina immediately switched to her sweet little sister act. ""Oh, Kaiden! The nanny was being completely inappropriate, so I wanted to discipline her. But these guards won't listen to me!""  
  
Kaiden's cold gaze swept over the security team. ""What did she pay you? Since when do you ignore direct orders from family?""  
  
He looked at Brooklyn with pure disgust. ""Get her out of my sight. She's making me sick.""  
  
The study door slammed shut.  
  
He used to warm my feet against his chest when I got cold at night. Now he's sending me to freeze.  
  
With Kaiden's permission, the guards had no choice.  
  
Brooklyn closed her eyes as they dragged her toward the basement. She'd always been sensitive to cold—that's why Kaiden used to keep the mansion at exactly 75 degrees year-round.  
  
'Can't have my baby getting cold,' he'd say, pulling me closer.  
  
Now he doesn't give a damn if I freeze to death.  
  
The cold storage was brutal—probably 20 degrees below zero. Brooklyn curled up in the corner, her thin cotton dress doing nothing against the bitter cold.  
  
It's fine. Just a few more hours. Then I can pack and get the hell out of here.  
  
I can go back to being Brooklyn Sheridan, not Kaiden Sheridan's obsession.  
  
Maybe I'll go to Europe. Start fresh somewhere he'll never think to look.  
  
Her teeth were chattering violently now. Ice crystals formed on her breath.  
  
God, I'm so tired. So tired of running, of being scared, of loving someone who sees me as property.  
  
Maybe this is how it ends. Maybe I just fall asleep here and never wake up.  
  
Just as consciousness started slipping away, she heard someone screaming her name like the world was ending.  
  
""BROOKLYN!!""  
  
A figure burst through the door, shaking as he gathered her frozen body into his arms.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
When Brooklyn woke up, harsh hospital fluorescents made her squint.  
  
""Brooklyn, how are you feeling? Are you hurt anywhere else?""  
  
A familiar voice drifted to her ears, followed by a concerned face coming into view.  
  
Alistar Roosevelt sat beside her hospital bed, dark circles under his eyes like he'd been keeping vigil all night.  
  
""...Alistar?""  
  
The memories before she'd blacked out came rushing back. She struggled to sit up. ""You're the one who found me?""  
  
Alistar nodded, his voice still shaky. ""I kept calling but you wouldn't pick up. When I got to the Sheridan place, the staff told me you were locked in the freezer...""  
  
He was interrupted when the TV in her room suddenly blared breaking news—  
  
""In a stunning announcement today, Sheridan Industries and Wingston Corp confirmed their merger through marriage. CEO Kaiden Sheridan and heiress Karina Wingston will wed next month in what's being called the wedding of the decade...""  
  
On screen, Kaiden looked every inch the billionaire in his charcoal Armani suit, jaw set like granite, while Karina hung off his arm with a megawatt smile that screamed 'I won.'  
  
Perfect. They look perfect together, Brooklyn thought bitterly. Two beautiful, rich, soulless people.  
  
Alistar quickly grabbed the remote and killed the TV.  
  
The hospital room went dead quiet.  
  
After a few seconds, he took a shaky breath and met her eyes. ""Brooklyn, I know everything that's been happening.""  
  
""You couldn't get away before, but now... Kaiden doesn't remember shit."" His voice was quiet but determined. ""Let me get you out of here. Please.""  
  
Brooklyn stared at her hands. ""Thanks, Alistar, but I'm already getting my papers together to leave for France.""  
  
""The Sheridan family's had people in intelligence and national security for three generations. They can't leave the country without massive government clearance."" She paused. ""Once I'm in Paris, he'll never be able to follow me.""  
  
Never. Because they'll never let him leave, and I'll never come back.  
  
Relief flooded Alistar's face, and he almost grabbed her hand before catching himself. ""That's amazing! I can help you with all the paperwork!""  
  
She pulled back slightly, and he noticed.  
  
""Shit, sorry. I'm just..."" He ran a hand through his hair. ""Really fucking relieved, you know?""  
  
He hesitated, then looked at her with those earnest brown eyes. ""But I need you to know something.""  
  
""How I feel about you. You've gotta know by now, right?""  
  
Brooklyn's chest tightened. She stayed silent.  
  
Of course I know.  
  
From day one of Kaiden's obsession, Alistar had been her only friend. Her only ally.  
  
He'd offered to help her run away countless times, but she knew what Kaiden was capable of better than anyone.  
  
She'd tried escaping dozens of times. Never made it more than a few blocks before his security dragged her back.  
  
One time, some investment banker had bought her a drink at a charity gala—purely innocent. The guy disappeared. Not just from New York. From fucking existence.  
  
Kaiden's reach extended everywhere—FBI contacts, CIA connections, judges, senators. She couldn't escape, and she sure as hell wasn't going to get Alistar killed trying.  
  
So she'd kept him at arm's length, no matter how much it hurt.  
  
She closed her eyes, her hands shaking. ""Alistar, I can't—""  
  
""Hey, no."" He held up his hands. ""I'm not asking you to feel anything right now.""  
  
""I just want you to know..."" He took a deep breath. ""Once you're free, you can actually live again.""  
  
""Do whatever job makes you happy, travel wherever you want, and... maybe fall in love with someone who won't treat you like property.""  
  
His smile was sad but genuine. ""Even if it's not me, I just want you to be happy.""  
  
""I want you to remember what normal feels like. Don't let this year destroy who you really are.""  
  
God, he's too good for this world, Brooklyn thought, tears pricking her eyes. Too good for me.  
  
After a long moment, she whispered, ""Thank you.""  
  
""Once I'm in Paris, I'm going to live like a normal person again."" She looked out at the bright afternoon sun, her voice stronger now. ""See the Louvre, drink wine at sidewalk cafes, maybe even fall in love with some pretentious French artist.""  
  
Someone who doesn't know my name. Someone who'll never know what I've been.  
  
Alistar's whole face lit up. ""Then let me help you get there.""  
  
That afternoon, Alistar drove her to the French consulate and waited while she rushed through her visa application.  
  
""With expedited processing, you should have approval in ten to fourteen days,"" the consular officer said, handing back her passport. ""Bon voyage, mademoiselle.""  
  
Walking out into the Manhattan sunshine, Brooklyn felt something she hadn't experienced in over a year—hope.  
  
Two weeks. Just two more weeks and I'm free.  
  
Alistar drove her back to the Sheridan mansion, chatting about practical stuff the whole way—where she should live in Paris, how to set up a French bank account, whether she'd need a job or if her settlement money would be enough.  
  
""My family's got some business interests in Europe,"" he mentioned casually. ""I might be able to transfer to our London office. You know, just to be in the same time zone if you need anything.""  
  
He's following me to Europe. For me.  
  
Brooklyn's stomach twisted with guilt. ""Alistar, don't uproot your whole life—""  
  
""I'm not,"" he said quickly. ""We've been wanting to expand anyway. It's not just about you.""  
  
Liar. Sweet, wonderful liar.  
  
They pulled up to the mansion's circular driveway. Brooklyn was reaching for the door handle when Alistar suddenly said, ""Wait.""  
  
He leaned over and gently smoothed down a strand of hair that had escaped from her ponytail, his fingers barely grazing her cheek.  
  
So gentle. So different from...  
  
Brooklyn automatically looked up at him, but then her blood turned to ice.  
  
On the mansion's front steps, Kaiden Sheridan stood like a statue, his dark eyes locked on her face with laser focus.  
  
How long has he been watching us?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Kaiden stood there in his perfectly tailored suit, expression cold as steel, that commanding presence radiating from him like a warning.  
  
Brooklyn's fingers trembled. She quickly turned to Alistar. ""You should go.""  
  
Alistar didn't notice anything wrong, still talking. ""When your papers come through, you—""  
  
""Just go!"" Her voice cracked with barely controlled panic. She looked at him desperately. ""Please.""  
  
He blinked, confused, but finally nodded. ""Okay. Be careful.""  
  
Brooklyn waited until his car disappeared down the driveway before turning around. Each step toward the mansion felt like walking to her execution.  
  
Kaiden remained motionless on the steps, watching her with those dark, unreadable eyes.  
  
Jesus, my heart's beating so loud he can probably hear it.  
  
She was shaking all over, terrified of what was coming.  
  
Would he explode? Would he break Alistar's hands like he used to do to any man who so much as looked at her?  
  
But when he finally spoke, his voice was flat and emotionless:  
  
""We have guests. Go prepare the coffee service.""  
  
Then he turned and walked inside, leaving her standing there like an idiot.  
  
That's it? No screaming, no threats, no violence?  
  
She stood frozen for a long moment, hardly daring to breathe.  
  
He really doesn't remember. He really doesn't give a shit about me anymore.  
  
Relief and something that felt suspiciously like heartbreak warred in her chest as she headed to the kitchen.  
  
But when she carried the silver tray with coffee and petit fours into the living room, she stopped dead.  
  
Sitting in the center of the sofa like a queen holding court was Karina Wingston—the woman from the news announcement.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan and Alina were clustered around her, all smiles as they discussed wedding plans in excited voices.  
  
Kaiden sat slightly apart, not participating but listening with polite attention.  
  
They look so fucking happy, Brooklyn thought bitterly. Like Christmas morning.  
  
She kept her head down and approached quietly. ""Your coffee, Miss Wingston.""  
  
Karina looked up with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""Thank you.""  
  
She reached for the delicate china cup, then suddenly ""fumbled"" it—  
  
Scalding coffee splashed across Karina's cream Chanel blouse.  
  
Before Brooklyn could even process what happened, Alina's hand cracked across her face.  
  
""You did that on purpose, didn't you?!""  
  
Brooklyn opened her mouth to explain—""It wasn't me—""  
  
But Alina was already shrieking, turning to Kaiden like a tattletale kid. ""I've been trying to tell you! This nanny has been obsessed with you!""  
  
She pointed at Brooklyn with disgust. ""She steals your stuff, stares at you constantly—she's totally unhinged! Now that she knows you're engaged to Karina, she's gone completely psycho!""  
  
This is insane. They're all insane.  
  
Brooklyn's blood turned to ice. ""I didn't do anything—""  
  
But Karina was already speaking, tears glistening in her perfectly made-up eyes. ""Kaiden, someone in your position will always attract... unstable people. If you don't handle this firmly, others might try the same thing.""  
  
Oh, you manipulative bitch.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan immediately chimed in: ""Absolutely! She needs to be punished!""  
  
Brooklyn's heart sank as understanding hit her like a freight train.  
  
This was planned. All of it. They set me up.  
  
And Kaiden hated nothing more than women who threw themselves at him.  
  
Sure enough, his voice cut through the room like a blade: ""Take her to the stables. Twenty lashes.""  
  
Without another glance, he scooped Karina into his arms and headed upstairs. ""I'll call my private doctor.""  
  
Twenty lashes. Oh God.  
  
Before Brooklyn could say another word, two security guards grabbed her arms and dragged her outside toward the horse stables behind the mansion.  
  
The night air was freezing against her skin.  
  
Alina followed them out, practically vibrating with excitement as she picked up a leather riding crop from the tack room.  
  
""Finally,"" she breathed, eyes gleaming with malice. ""You're mine now, you pathetic little slut.""  
  
She raised the crop high.  
  
CRACK!  
  
The first blow across Brooklyn's back sent fire through her nerves. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from screaming.  
  
""That's for stealing my life!""  
  
CRACK!  
  
The second strike split through her thin sweater. She could feel warm blood starting to seep through the fabric.  
  
""That's for seducing my brother!""  
  
CRACK!  
  
""And that's for being a worthless piece of trash!""  
  
Don't scream. Don't give her the satisfaction.  
  
But each strike of the crop felt like a branding iron. Blood ran down her back, soaking through her clothes and dripping onto the stable floor.  
  
""Scream!"" Alina shrieked, hitting harder. ""Come on, where's all that attitude now? My brother can't save you anymore!""  
  
Twenty lashes felt like two hundred.  
  
Alina seemed determined to release years of jealousy and rage with each brutal strike. By the end, Brooklyn could barely stay upright.  
  
All she could hear was Alina's vicious laughter and the sharp crack of leather against torn flesh.  
  
When the final blow landed, Brooklyn's knees gave out. She collapsed onto the hay-strewn floor, the world going black around the edges.  
  
Maybe this is how it ends. Maybe I just die here like the animal they think I am.",1,1748679010.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Victor Vaughn, the heir of the Metro Society, was known far and wide for being a devoted husband. For my birthday, he bought up every firework and rose in the city.

It was the strawberry-flavored one that I hated.I paused slightly.Then, I bent down to pick up the condom.The pink packaging, as I brought it closer, still carried the nauseating smell of strawberries.But that familiar package… I felt like I had seen it somewhere before.Last month, when I visited Victor's office, I happened to run into his new secretary, who was holding a package.She didn't see me and bumped straight into me, causing the box in her hand to drop. Tiny foil squares scattered across the [floor.You](http://floor.You) okay?"" I'd asked, automatically crouching to help. Juliette's face turned bright red when she saw me.Mrs. Vaughn, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to bump into you.""As I picked up a small packet, she quickly snatched it out of my hand, blushing. At the time, I just found it funny. Why would a young girl buy something so personal in the office? But Juliette smiled and explained, a touch of pride in her eyes.

""This is from my boyfriend. We go through them so fast; we need to buy more every few days. Mrs. Vaughn, please keep this a secret.""

The memory snapped back to me, and now, holding the exact same wrapper, my blood turned to ice.

""Sweetheart, what are you thinking about?""

Victor walked out of the bathroom, still wrapped in steam, and gently hugged me from behind.

Seeing my pale face, his heart tightened. He pulled me close with a worried expression.

""What's wrong, baby? Did someone upset you? Is there someone in your department bothering you? Just tell me, and I'll fire them immediately!""

I slowly raised my head, silently gazing into Victor's eyes.

Six years of marriage, and he was always so gentle, caring, and attentive to me.

Whenever I wasn't feeling happy, he'd buy every rose in the city to cheer me up, rent out a giant private cinema for me, and find any way to make me smile.

Everyone said he was a rich, pampered husband.

I felt like he spoiled me too much and laughed.

""Keep this up, and they'll say I'm your downfall.""

But Victor didn't care at all. His eyes were full of tenderness as he held me tightly.

""Then let me burn the world for you.""

Those words from the past echoed in my ears.

But people change.

I smiled bitterly, raising my hand and waving the pink package in front of him.

""What's this?""

Victor's face flickered with panic, but he quickly regained his composure.

""Sweetheart, where did you find this? I've never seen it before.""

I pointed to the coat next to me. ""It fell out of the pocket.""

Victor froze for a moment, then knocked his head in frustration.

""It's my fault, I must've grabbed the wrong thing during the team-building event last time.""

""Must've grabbed it by mistake at the company picnic. Someone ordered chicken wings; I thought these were napkins.""

I stared into Victor's eyes without saying a word.

Seeing my silence, Victor suddenly grew tearful and hugged me, explaining desperately.

""Evie, you don't think this is mine, do you? I know you hate strawberry flavor more than anything. We don't keep anything strawberry-scented at home, so this couldn't possibly be mine.""

As he explained, he pulled me into his arms and kissed me gently.

""Sweetheart, you are my everything. If you don't believe me, I'll go back to the office and figure out who this belongs to, and fire them right away.""

His eyes were clear, with no sign of lying.

Saying this, Victor actually stood up, ready to leave.

I grabbed the corner of his shirt and smiled.

""No need.""

Victor turned around, and I spoke clearly, one word at a time.

""I trust you. You wouldn't lie to me.""

Victor smiled and ruffled my hair before getting up to prepare the lunch I'd take to work the next day.

I leaned against the railing on the second floor, watching his busy figure in the kitchen, lost in thought.

After six years of marriage, Victor insisted on cooking for me himself.

No matter how busy he was, he always found time to prepare fresh ingredients and cook meals for me so I could take them to work the next day.

My coworkers would ask, ""Mr. Vaughn, with all your money, you could hire any five-star chef. Why waste time cooking yourself?""

Every time, Victor would answer, ""Evie likes the meals I make.""

As long as I liked it, he would do it without hesitation.

But how could he have forgotten?

On our wedding day, I told him that if he ever lied to me,

I would disappear completely from his world.

Chapter 2

Outside, the thunder rumbled. After seeing I had fallen asleep, Victor carefully tucked me in.

Just as he was about to wrap his arms around me from behind, his phone rang.

In the dim light, Victor frowned as he glanced at his phone, then looked back at me, still sound asleep.

The footsteps quickly faded away.

Downstairs, I heard him deliberately lower his voice.

""Didn't I say no calls after work hours? Anything can wait until tomorrow. Don't bother me when I'm with my wife… What? You came to my house?""

Victor quickly hung up and rushed downstairs.

I got out of bed, slowly making my way to the floor-to-ceiling window.

This spot offered a great view, allowing me to clearly see outside the villa door, where Juliette stood drenched.

The door opened soon after.

Victor was holding an umbrella.

What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you not to come near my house, and especially not in front of my wife?""

Juliette looked up at him, her face filled with pleading.

""Victor, I'm scared of the thunder. I… I missed you.""

She tiptoed and kissed Victor on the lips.

Victor stiffened.

He held the umbrella with one hand to shield her from the rain, while his other hand rested on Juliette's waist to steady her.

""Stop this.""

Victor said this, but his actions showed no signs of stopping her.

He let her kiss him enough, then frowned slightly and reached up to wipe the rain from her face.

""Before I met you, how did you get through rainy days? You're soaking wet. I'll take you to shower, or you might catch a cold.""

Juliette's clothes were soaked through, clinging to her body, accentuating her alluring curves.

Victor quickly looked away, swallowing hard.

""Victor, can I take a shower at your place?""

At her request, Victor's expression immediately turned cold.

""No.""If Evelyn sees you—"" He thrust his jacket at her. ""Wait in the car.""

Then he tossed her the car keys.

Victor handed her the umbrella, then turned back to change and came into the bedroom to turn off the lights.

Leave the light on.""

My voice suddenly broke the silence.

Victor's hand froze in place.

He stood there stunned for a moment, then turned to look at me, his smile a little stiff.

Sweetheart,"" he finally said, ""how long have you been awake?""

Chapter 3

I looked up at him, pretending to have just woken up.

""Honey, what are you doing standing there? Why aren't you coming to bed?""

My gaze fell on the suit he had changed into, and I frowned.

""Weren't you in your pajamas just now? Do you have somewhere to go?""

No, I was just trying on the clothes I'll wear tomorrow. I'll be right to bed, sweetheart.""

Victor told me to sleep first, but I insisted on watching him get into bed with me.

Victor's face was calm, though he was hiding something. He changed back into his pajamas and held me close.

Sleep tight, baby.""

I closed my eyes, but my mind kept replaying the image of him kissing Juliette earlier.

Juliette, his assistant, had been with the company for two years now.

Before this, I never suspected anything between them.

To reassure me, Victor had insisted on hiring only male assistants after we married—no woman could get close to him.

The day Juliette applied for the job, I happened to drop by with fruit for Victor.

When I learned she hadn't been hired, Juliette collapsed on the floor in despair and cried uncontrollably.

""Please, Mr. Vaughn, if I don't get this job, I'll die.""

Victor remained cold and indifferent.

In desperation, Juliette ran to the company's rooftop to threaten him.

""Victor, I meet all the qualifications, why should I lose this job just because I'm a woman? I won't accept it! If you don't hire me, I'll jump from here today.""

Worried about the scandal, I convinced Victor to take her on.

After that, he never treated her kindly, only letting her assist him behind the scenes.

But when did they start… this affair?

My thoughts were a tangled mess. Victor was fretting over his secretary downstairs, and here we were, each lost in our own thoughts.

Several times, Victor tried to pull his hand away, but I held on tightly.

After what felt like an eternity, I heard a low sigh from him.

Victor opened his phone and sent a message to his assistant.

I squinted and caught a glimpse of what he sent:

Juliette is in my car. Take her to a hotel—I can't get away.""

The assistant quickly replied.

Victor sighed in relief, put his phone down, and cuddled up to sleep with me.

The next day, when we got to the office, the atmosphere was off. Juliette had thrown a tantrum and made a mess of the office.

Colleagues surrounded her, trying to comfort her.

""Jules, did you have a fight with your boyfriend?""

Those dark circles! Did he keep you up all night?""

Stop talking nonsense, can't you see that Jules is upset? It must be because her boyfriend mistreated her. There's no good man out there…""

When I walked in, I met Juliette's swollen, tearful eyes.

Her gaze shifted to Victor behind me.

You're right. All men are the same. They're all liars!""

She flirted blatantly with the male assistant, glaring at Victor.

Victor remained calm as ever.

But I felt the stiffness in his posture.

As usual, he made me coffee and brought it to my office.

Baby, I made your coffee with extra sugar. I know you like it that way.""

Victor wrapped his arms around my waist from behind.

Go ahead and work, I'll have the assistant bring your lunch in a while.""

I nodded, and Victor quickly went back to work.

But as he passed by, he called out to Juliette without any emotion, ""Come to my office.""

Colleagues began gossiping.

Mr. Vaughn's gonna rip into her again.""

Last time, they spent two hours in his office. Afterward, Juliette came out with red eyes, staggering. I feel sorry for Juliette, she's been stuck working for him all this time.""Yeah, Mr. Vaughn only spoils his wife Evelyn. He doesn't care about anyone else…""

I couldn't help but sneer at their conversation.

Is that so?

I hesitated for a moment, then opened my laptop to check the surveillance.

After some adjustments, Victor's figure appeared on the screen.

This was from a hidden camera I had bought just a few days ago.

I had placed it in Victor's office to test the camera's clarity.

I never imagined it would come in handy.

The office door closed.

Juliette, with a cold expression, pouted. Victor sighed in frustration but pulled her into his arms with affection.

You were trying to provoke me earlier. I told you, last night I couldn't get away because my wife woke up. Don't be mad. Tonight, I'll tell Evelyn I'm on a business trip, and I'll spend the whole night with you. Okay?""

Juliette looked up at him with pitiful eyes. ""Who knows if you're lying to me again?""

""Every day, you're always with Evelyn, cooking for her. You never make me any food.""

Juliette pretended to punch him playfully. ""Do you believe me? I'll eat all the food you made for Evelyn at lunch!""

Victor's face darkened. ""Don't you dare.""

""I told you, we keep our affair secret from Evelyn. If she knows anything, not only will I fire you, but I'll never see you again. Get it together.""

When Victor loosened his grip, Juliette quickly grabbed his hand, looking scared.

I'm sorry, I was just joking. You left me last night. I'm still upset. Don't you know how to comfort me?""

Looking at Juliette's pitiful face, Victor's eyes darkened with possessiveness.

He grabbed the back of her head and kissed her roughly.

She whimpered in his arms.

She fumbled to untie his tie, eager to undo his belt.

Is the door closed?"" Victor asked in a hoarse voice.

Juliette nodded like a doe, ""It's already closed. Your wife won't find out.""

I stared at the scene on my laptop, tears streaming down my face.

They couldn't even wait for a hotel. They were already all over each other in the office.

I fought the urge to break down the door and watched the whole thing quietly, recording the screen as evidence.

First tried it during our vacation in Bantayan Island years ago - bought from ambulant vendors at the Hagnaya port. I was intrigued because I thought it resembled  tamales but it was rather on the dessert side and midly sweet which I liked.

With a handful of pantry ingredients blended togetger (fresh sweetcorn, cornmeal/riceflour, cornstarch, dessicated coconut/coconut milk, sugar/condensed milk)  i tried to replicate it albeit with minor tweaks and the result is just as good.

Pintos is soft, subtly sweet, and has that comforting coconut flavor that reminds you of the joys of simple life. It's perfect with a cup of coffee or as a little afternoon pick-me-up.

Chapter 1  
  
I just spent a million dollars on a diamond necklace at auction, only to discover my CEO husband gifted it to his secretary the very next day.  
  
His secretary posted on Instagram:  
  
\[Little Kitty has been marked by her Master now. Forever loyal to him. Meow\~\]  
  
In the photo, she's wearing a maid costume and had split my necklace into two pieces.  
  
One strand wrapped around her cat's neck.  
  
The other dangling from her own ankle.  
  
I called my husband demanding an explanation, but he didn't pick up.  
  
Thirty minutes later, I posted my own update:  
  
\[Not bad for a cat bed made of famous paintings. Little pussy knows quality when she sees it.\]  
  
The photo showed all of my husband's authentic paintings in his office—completely shredded and stuffed into my cat's bed.  
  
My new post hadn't been up for even ten minutes.  
  
When I checked, there were already hundreds of comments.  
  
\[OMG! That's a genuine Van Gogh, and you shredded it? That's some real rich people shit.\]  
  
\[Who was stupid enough to piss off our CEO's wife?\]  
  
...  
  
I smirked, scrolling through the comments with amusement.  
  
Suddenly, my husband's name flashed on my screen.  
  
Dead silent before, but now he's suddenly alive.  
  
I answered slowly, taking my time.  
  
His roaring voice immediately filled my ear.  
  
""Vivian, what the hell are you doing now!""  
  
""Do you have any idea how valuable those paintings were?!""  
  
I laughed softly before firing back.  
  
""Me?""  
  
""That's rich coming from you, Marcus.""  
  
""What about my million-dollar necklace that you just handed off to someone else?""  
  
""Letting her split it up to put on her cat's neck and her own ankle?""  
  
""I thought this was your new thing.""  
  
""Taking precious items, breaking them apart, rearranging them for fun.""  
  
""So I helped you out by breaking apart and rearranging your precious paintings.""  
  
""Quite the stylish cat bed, don't you think?""  
  
Marcus was speechless.  
  
After a few seconds of silence, he finally explained in a stiff voice.  
  
""Amber just closed a big deal for the company.""  
  
""The necklace was her bonus.""  
  
""How she chose to use it isn't my concern.""  
  
""Oh? A bonus?""  
  
""Your chief assistant has closed how many major deals for you?""  
  
""I don't see you giving him such generous rewards.""  
  
""And besides,"" I paused, my voice turning cold, ""you used MY property to score points with her.""  
  
""Your double standard is impressive, Marcus.""  
  
Marcus fell silent again.  
  
I didn't give him time to think of a comeback.  
  
""How exactly did she 'close' this big deal?""  
  
""Don't tell me she was wearing that maid outfit, calling some client 'Master' on her knees?""  
  
""Vivian!""  
  
Marcus's voice suddenly shot up.  
  
""Can you stop being so disgusting!""  
  
""There's nothing going on between Amber and me!""  
  
""Nothing going on?""  
  
I laughed like I'd heard the joke of the century.  
  
""In your world, Marcus,""  
  
""As long as you haven't shared a bed, it means nothing?""  
  
""You're impossible to deal with!""  
  
Marcus, clearly cornered with no comeback, hung up.  
  
The smile completely vanished from my face.  
  
My family, the Winters, are genuine old money.  
  
As their only daughter, I was my parents' treasure since childhood.  
  
Back then, the Reynolds were still second-tier. They desperately wanted to use my family's connections to break into the elite circle.  
  
So they carefully packaged Marcus Reynolds and presented him to me.  
  
I have to admit, the Marcus of those days was handsome, capable, and treated me with unmatched tenderness.  
  
Young and naive, I agreed to what seemed like a perfect match.  
  
After our marriage, his family got exactly what they wanted. Riding on my family's coattails, they soared upward, thriving in business and society.  
  
In just a few years, the Reynolds even showed signs of surpassing some old established families.  
  
Perhaps power and wealth came too quickly.  
  
Marcus gradually forgot how he obtained everything he has today.  
  
He became arrogant.  
  
That was like biting the hand that fed him.  
  
Since he's so fond of keeping these tacky ""Little Kittys"" outside our marriage...  
  
I'll give him a real one to deal with!  
  
Thirty minutes later, a massive, fierce-looking Maine Coon cat was delivered to me.  
  
Sorry, bestie, I need to borrow your domineering pet today to settle a score.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I gathered Marcus's collection of limited-edition luxury watches, stringing them together to create a giant bracelet. Then I grabbed five or six of his favorite hand-tailored Italian silk ties, knotted them together, and attached them to the watch bracelet—voilà, a cat leash!  
  
With the makeshift leash in one hand and the bracelet in the other, I brought the cat to Marcus's company headquarters.  
  
""Where's my husband?"" I asked sweetly.  
  
The receptionist looked up and her eyes nearly popped out of her head.  
  
""M-Mrs. Reynolds! He's in a meeting.""  
  
I walked straight to the conference room, gave a gentle knock, and pushed the door open without waiting.  
  
""I'm so sorry to interrupt, everyone.""  
  
""We need to pause this meeting. I have an urgent matter for Mr. Reynolds.""  
  
My tone was pleasant, my smile perfectly appropriate.  
  
Everyone in the room noticed what I was holding and struggled to contain their laughter.  
  
Marcus sat at the head of the table, his face ashen.  
  
The meeting was promptly suspended, and everyone quickly filed out of the room.  
  
Before Marcus could close the door and unleash his fury,  
  
His secretary—Amber Stevens waltzed in with two coffees, swaying her hips.  
  
""Sir, I brought you—AHHH!!!""  
  
Before she could finish, the Maine Coon broke free from my grip and charged straight at her!  
  
Cat fur flew everywhere.  
  
I laughed softly.  
  
""Aww, look! They recognize each other as the same species. How excited!""  
  
Amber was absolutely terrified by the sudden attack, spilling coffee all over herself.  
  
She screamed, frantically trying to protect herself from the cat's claws.  
  
In the chaos, the cat's paws caught the leash, unraveling the ties, while several watches from the bracelet fell to the floor, their faces shattering on impact.  
  
Marcus finally snapped, jumping to his feet.  
  
""Vivian! What the hell are you doing?!""  
  
""Isn't throwing tantrums at home enough? You have to bring this circus to my office too?""  
  
""Get this wild cat out of here right now!""  
  
I gave him my most innocent look.  
  
""Wild cat?""  
  
""Honey, this is the special pet I got just for you.""  
  
""I heard you've developed a thing for little Kittys lately.""  
  
""So I found you an expensive one.""  
  
""You better take good care of her. I'll be checking in on both of you regularly,"" I said, my eyes darting meaningfully between him and Amber.  
  
Stifling a laugh, I walked over and scooped up the cat, then shoved the tie-leash into Marcus's hands. I turned my cold gaze toward the disheveled Amber.  
  
""Miss Stevens, is this how you conduct yourself?""  
  
""So clumsy and careless!""  
  
""This cat is my precious new purchase. If anything happens to it because of you, you'll answer to me personally!""  
  
Amber finally snapped out of her shock.  
  
Her face turned ghostly pale as she apologized repeatedly, her voice trembling.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Reynolds. I didn't mean to... I...""  
  
Only then did Marcus notice that all the shattered items on the floor were his watches.  
  
Looking at the ""leash"" in his hand, he realized they were his beloved custom-made ties!  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""Vivian! Have you completely lost your mind?!""  
  
His voice shot up several octaves.  
  
""Bringing a wild cat to disrupt my workplace is bad enough!""  
  
""But destroying my watches! My ties! Just wasting them like this?!""  
  
""These are priceless collector's items!""  
  
His voice shook with rage.  
  
""Tell me! Why do you keep destroying my things?!""  
  
I stroked the cat calmly while looking at him.  
  
""Marcus, I'm just following your example.""  
  
I paused, glancing at Amber.  
  
""Didn't you carelessly give my million-dollar necklace to your 'little wild cat' here?""  
  
Marcus choked on my words, staring at me in disbelief.  
  
""All this over a necklace?""  
  
""You shred my paintings, and now you're destroying my watches and ties?""  
  
His face showed exhaustion and bewilderment.  
  
""I already explained! It was a bonus for Amber!""  
  
""It's just a damn necklace!""  
  
""Fine! I'll buy you ten more—better and more expensive ones!""  
  
I sat down in his chair.  
  
Looking at Marcus's increasingly furious face, my mood brightened.  
  
""Oh, please don't stop now.""  
  
""Keep giving bonus.""  
  
""I've been wondering what to do with the rest of your precious collection anyway.""  
  
I looked down and noticed an open document on the table—an investment contract with the Kinlin Corporation.  
  
I tapped the contract with my finger.  
  
""This looks promising.""  
  
""Maybe you should give this away next?""  
  
""VIVIAN!""  
  
Marcus spat out my name through clenched teeth.  
  
""You can throw all the tantrums you want at home. Nobody's stopping you.""  
  
""But my company business? That's off-limits.""  
  
""This isn't your personal playground for your meltdowns.""  
  
I stared at his livid face and smiled as I picked up the contract.  
  
Page by page, I ripped it to shreds.  
  
I flung my hand up, releasing the pieces.  
  
Countless paper fragments floated down, landing on both Marcus and Amber.  
  
Marcus completely lost it, lunging toward me.  
  
""VIVIAN!!!""  
  
""What the HELL do you want?!""  
  
""Have you actually lost your mind?!""  
  
I stepped back, my smile slowly fading.  
  
""Lost my mind?""  
  
""Marcus, you're the one who's lost it.""  
  
I stared at him coldly, all playfulness gone from my eyes.  
  
""This contract? I'm the one who secured it.""  
  
""Now I'm upset, so I'm destroying it. Problem?""  
  
This project had been stalled for ages, with the client being incredibly difficult. Marcus had been stressed to the breaking point over it.  
  
As luck would have it, the head of the client company was Uncle Wilson, who'd known me since I was in diapers.  
  
I called him, subtly mentioning Marcus's company, hoping he might cut them some slack.  
  
Uncle Wilson agreed immediately.  
  
Later, Amber happened to be the one who handled the final negotiation, getting credit for the easy signing.  
  
""You secured it?""  
  
""Vivian, there's a limit to how much bullshit you can spew.""  
  
""Amber worked on this deal for over a month to get it signed!""  
  
""And now you waltz in here, destroy it, and have the audacity to claim you made it happen?""  
  
""Have you no shame?!""  
  
On cue, Amber started sobbing.  
  
She gazed at Marcus with puppy-dog eyes, tears streaming down her face.  
  
""Mr. Reynolds...""  
  
""I worked so hard on this project, staying late every night, preparing countless materials...""  
  
""I know your wife doesn't like me, but... but she can't just make up lies about me and dismiss all my hard work...""  
  
Her shoulders shook dramatically, as if she'd suffered some terrible injustice.  
  
This was the first time I really looked at her.

1kzrtnm,https://i.redd.it/mdxm2amar24f1.jpeg,Wild Mushroom Magic - Dehydrate & Powder Power!,"Today, we're diving into the amazing world of wild mushrooms! These nutritional powerhouses are packed with flavour and can elevate your WFPB meals to the next level.

Once you've got your hands on some beautiful, safe wild mushrooms, what's next? Well, fresh mushrooms are amazing, but they don't last forever. That's where our trusty Ninja Airfryer comes in! Today, I'm going to show you how to easily dehydrate wild mushrooms and then transform them into an incredibly versatile and flavourful mushroom powder. This stuff is like magic dust for your WFPB kitchen!

Full video guide here… https://youtu.be/n0Lm1hJVn8g

Part 1: Why Dehydrate Wild Mushrooms?
So, why bother dehydrating? Great question!
 * Preservation: Dehydration extends the shelf life of your precious mushrooms by months, even up to a year if stored properly. No more worrying about them going slimy in the fridge!
 * Concentrated Flavour: The dehydration process intensifies that amazing umami flavour mushrooms are famous for. A little goes a long way!
 * Nutrient Retention: While some very sensitive vitamins might slightly decrease, dehydration is generally a great way to preserve most of the mushrooms' nutritional goodness, like B vitamins, selenium, and potassium.
 * Versatility: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated for use in soups, stews, and sautés, or, as we'll see today, powdered for an instant flavour boost.
 * Space Saving: A huge basket of fresh mushrooms shrinks down significantly once dried, saving you precious pantry space.

Part 2: Prepping Your Wild Mushrooms for Dehydration
Hibby: Alright, let's get these beauties ready for their drying session.
 * Cleaning is Key: Wild mushrooms can be a bit... earthy. Avoid soaking them in water if you can, as they'll absorb too much moisture, prolonging drying time. A soft brush, a damp paper towel, or a quick rinse followed by thorough patting dry is usually best. For some varieties with lots of nooks and crannies, a very quick dunk and immediate dry might be necessary.
 * Slicing for Success: Uniformity is your friend here. Slice your mushrooms to a consistent thickness. I recommend about 1/4 inch or roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Thicker slices will take longer to dry, and uneven slices mean some bits might be damp while others are overly dry.

   * Pro Tip: For smaller mushrooms, you might be able to leave them whole or just halve them. Use your judgment based on their size and density.

Part 3: Dehydrating in Your Ninja Airfryer

Now for the magic of the Ninja Airfryer! Most Ninja models with a dehydrate function work brilliantly for this.

 * Arranging on Trays: Lay your sliced mushrooms in a single layer on your Ninja Airfryer's dehydrating racks (or air fry basket if that’s what you’re using – though racks are better for airflow). Don't overcrowd them! Good air circulation is crucial for even drying. You might need to work in batches depending on how many mushrooms you have.

 * Setting the Temperature: We're aiming for a low and slow approach to preserve those nutrients and flavours. Set your Ninja Airfryer to the Dehydrate function. The ideal temperature range for mushrooms is typically between 110-125°F (or about 43-52°C). Check your Ninja's manual for its specific dehydrate settings, but this is a good general range. If your model has a specific ""mushroom"" setting, even better!

 * Time to Dry: This is where patience comes in, folks! Dehydrating mushrooms can take anywhere from 4 to 10 hours, sometimes even longer, depending on:
   * The type of mushroom (some have higher water content).
   * The thickness of your slices.
   * The humidity in your kitchen.
   * Your specific Airfryer model.
 * Checking for Doneness: Start checking your mushrooms around the 4-hour mark, and then every hour or so after that. They're ready when they are ""leathery"" to ""crisp"" dry. They should feel dry to the touch and snap easily if you try to bend them (especially if aiming for powder). If they still feel pliable or damp, they need more time.
   * Important: It's better to slightly over-dry than under-dry, as any remaining moisture can lead to spoilage.

Part 4: Conditioning & Storing Your Dried Mushrooms
Hibby: Once your mushrooms are perfectly dehydrated, there's one more important step called ""conditioning.""
 * Cool Completely: Let the dried mushrooms cool completely before storing.
 * Conditioning: Place the cooled, dried mushrooms into an airtight glass jar, filling it about two-thirds full. For the next few days, shake the jar once or twice a day. This helps to distribute any residual moisture evenly among the pieces. If you see any condensation forming inside the jar, the mushrooms aren't dry enough and need to go back into the dehydrator for a bit longer.
 * Proper Storage: Once conditioned and confirmed dry, store your dehydrated mushrooms in airtight containers (glass jars are perfect) in a cool, dark, and dry place. Away from direct sunlight and heat. Properly stored, they can last for many months, even up to a year!

Part 5: Creating Wild Mushroom Powder.
Okay, team, now for the really exciting part – transforming these flavour bombs into an incredible mushroom powder! This is where the culinary magic happens.
 * Ensure They're CRISP Dry: For powder, your mushrooms need to be absolutely cracker-dry. If they have any bend or chewiness, they won't powder well. If needed, pop them back in the Ninja on dehydrate for another hour or two until they snap.
 * Choose Your Weapon (Grinder):
   * Spice Grinder/Coffee Grinder: A dedicated coffee grinder that you use only for spices is perfect for this. Don't use the one you use for coffee beans unless you want mushroom-flavoured coffee (or vice-versa!).
   * High-Powered Blender: A good quality blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec, or even the Ninja blender attachment if it's powerful enough) can also work, especially for larger batches. You'll need to use the smallest blending cup if possible for finer results.
 * Grind in Batches: Don't overload your grinder. Work in small batches for the finest, most consistent powder.
 * Pulse and Grind: Pulse a few times to break up the larger pieces, then grind until you achieve a fine powder.
   * Safety Tip: Let the powder settle in the grinder for a minute or two before opening the lid to avoid a mushroom dust cloud! You can even drape a damp paper towel over the lid as an extra precaution.
 * Sieve: For an ultra-fine powder, you can sift it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any larger bits. These can be re-ground or just tossed into your next soup.

 * Storing Your Mushroom Powder: Store your beautiful homemade mushroom powder in a small, airtight jar, again in a cool, dark, dry place. It's even more susceptible to moisture than whole dried mushrooms, so a good seal is vital. It will last for months, retaining amazing flavour.
Part 6: How to Use Your Wild Mushroom Powder (WFPB Style!). 
Now for the fun part – how do we use this incredible WFPB flavour enhancer? The possibilities are endless!

 * Soups & Stews: Whisk it into broths for an instant depth of flavour. Amazing in lentil soup, bean chilli, or vegetable stews.
 * Sauces & Gravies: Adds a rich, savoury, umami kick to your plant-based sauces and gravies. Perfect for mushroom gravy without needing fresh mushrooms!
 * Seasoning Blends: Mix it with other herbs and spices to create your own unique seasoning blends for tofu, tempeh, roasted vegetables, or potatoes.
 * ""No-Cheese"" Sprinkles: Combine with nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt for a savoury sprinkle over pasta, popcorn, or salads.
 * Burgers & Loaves: Add a tablespoon or two to your homemade veggie burger patties or lentil loaves for an extra layer of deliciousness.
 * Dips & Spreads: Mix into hummus, cashew cream, or bean dips.
 * Bread & Savoury Bakes: You can even incorporate a little into savoury bread doughs or muffin recipes!

Part 1: Why Dehydrate Wild Mushrooms?
So, why bother dehydrating? Great question!
 * Preservation: Dehydration extends the shelf life of your precious mushrooms by months, even up to a year if stored properly. No more worrying about them going slimy in the fridge!
 * Concentrated Flavour: The dehydration process intensifies that amazing umami flavour mushrooms are famous for. A little goes a long way!
 * Nutrient Retention: While some very sensitive vitamins might slightly decrease, dehydration is generally a great way to preserve most of the mushrooms' nutritional goodness, like B vitamins, selenium, and potassium.
 * Versatility: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated for use in soups, stews, and sautés, or, as we'll see today, powdered for an instant flavour boost.
 * Space Saving: A huge basket of fresh mushrooms shrinks down significantly once dried, saving you precious pantry space.

Part 2: Prepping Your Wild Mushrooms for Dehydration
Hibby: Alright, let's get these beauties ready for their drying session.
 * Cleaning is Key: Wild mushrooms can be a bit... earthy. Avoid soaking them in water if you can, as they'll absorb too much moisture, prolonging drying time. A soft brush, a damp paper towel, or a quick rinse followed by thorough patting dry is usually best. For some varieties with lots of nooks and crannies, a very quick dunk and immediate dry might be necessary.
 * Slicing for Success: Uniformity is your friend here. Slice your mushrooms to a consistent thickness. I recommend about 1/4 inch or roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Thicker slices will take longer to dry, and uneven slices mean some bits might be damp while others are overly dry.

   * Pro Tip: For smaller mushrooms, you might be able to leave them whole or just halve them. Use your judgment based on their size and density.

Part 3: Dehydrating in Your Ninja Airfryer

Now for the magic of the Ninja Airfryer! Most Ninja models with a dehydrate function work brilliantly for this.

 * Arranging on Trays: Lay your sliced mushrooms in a single layer on your Ninja Airfryer's dehydrating racks (or air fry basket if that’s what you’re using – though racks are better for airflow). Don't overcrowd them! Good air circulation is crucial for even drying. You might need to work in batches depending on how many mushrooms you have.

 * Setting the Temperature: We're aiming for a low and slow approach to preserve those nutrients and flavours. Set your Ninja Airfryer to the Dehydrate function. The ideal temperature range for mushrooms is typically between 110-125°F (or about 43-52°C). Check your Ninja's manual for its specific dehydrate settings, but this is a good general range. If your model has a specific ""mushroom"" setting, even better!

 * Time to Dry: This is where patience comes in, folks! Dehydrating mushrooms can take anywhere from 4 to 10 hours, sometimes even longer, depending on:
   * The type of mushroom (some have higher water content).
   * The thickness of your slices.
   * The humidity in your kitchen.
   * Your specific Airfryer model.
 * Checking for Doneness: Start checking your mushrooms around the 4-hour mark, and then every hour or so after that. They're ready when they are ""leathery"" to ""crisp"" dry. They should feel dry to the touch and snap easily if you try to bend them (especially if aiming for powder). If they still feel pliable or damp, they need more time.
   * Important: It's better to slightly over-dry than under-dry, as any remaining moisture can lead to spoilage.

Part 4: Conditioning & Storing Your Dried Mushrooms
Hibby: Once your mushrooms are perfectly dehydrated, there's one more important step called ""conditioning.""
 * Cool Completely: Let the dried mushrooms cool completely before storing.
 * Conditioning: Place the cooled, dried mushrooms into an airtight glass jar, filling it about two-thirds full. For the next few days, shake the jar once or twice a day. This helps to distribute any residual moisture evenly among the pieces. If you see any condensation forming inside the jar, the mushrooms aren't dry enough and need to go back into the dehydrator for a bit longer.
 * Proper Storage: Once conditioned and confirmed dry, store your dehydrated mushrooms in airtight containers (glass jars are perfect) in a cool, dark, and dry place. Away from direct sunlight and heat. Properly stored, they can last for many months, even up to a year!

Lonely childhood, & a very unpleasant mom because of the breakup between her & my dad. Senior year ended with covid lockdown, & being embarrassed at graduation because I got tricked into going alone (my dad was drunk & thougt it would be funny to tell me that I only had to go pick up my robe & hat). Developed a crazy eating disorder during lockdown that still is not better. Goes to the psych ward for the first time & a bunch of more times after that, all for suicide attempts well as psychotic episodes. I want to go to college as a first gen college student, but my social worker intervened & said that I had to go inpatient for my ED before she could help me. I go inpatient & immediately get sexually harassed in the shower. Shower incident made me depressed, anxious, & nervous around bathrooms for a long time. Gets kicked out over shower incident. Return home & dad hounds me to get a job right away. Goes to work at a local gas station because I live in rural nowhere, & ED gets 10x worse. Another psych ward visit. Social worker tells me to go inpatient again. I try to ask about inpatient but they tell me that I need to be 'fasttracked' by doing outpatient first & then inpatient. Bank account gets drained immediately because they made me buy my own food & meds, they don't get included with the total bill. I go back home after a week. Gets another job at a department store coffee shop. Finds out that the entire store is infested with roaches, & I also had awful working conditions & a schedule that made it impossible to go to my weekly psychiatrist appointments. Quits department store job because I didn't even make enough money on my paychecks to pay for a hypothetical exterminator if I needed one due to the storewide infestation. Dad is angry. I try to enroll in JobCorps. Couldn't go to my first location of choice because the admissions coordinator literally refused to tell me where the bus stops (for the shuttle to campus) were. Tries a different location, but it takes an extra 2 months of waiting to get my file transferred over. Gets in, yay! Things go well for a few weeks until I get a new roommate. She's nice, but vapes in the room for literal hours each day. I develop asthma less than 2 weeks of being her roommate. She gets moved to a different room & she hates me. Also, she hates me while being floor lead, so I think all of the other leads on the floor hate me too. Also, most Job Corps students vape on campus, so a lot of people began to hate me I think. Things calm down for ~2 weeks. Thinks slowly start looking up. Gets a new roommate, she's super sweet & we have a lot of the same hobbies. Finally happy & confident in the future. Gets an email literally 1 day later telling us that our center (& most of the other centers) are shutting down. My dad makes me leave early. Has an asthma attack shortly after arriving home because my dad was smoking in the house while he's well aware of my asthma. Dad tells me to never come back.

Well! They got me gals! I'm so sick of trying to better myself & things never going well for me. I've just been so internally angry for the past two days, but I've been incredibly depressed for several weeks. & I'm kind of always depressed, but it's been extra bad on campus. But, while I didn't enjoy a lot of aspects of Job Corps, I am just so destroyed that one of my last options has just been ripped away from me. I keep having awful thoughts of destroying things & hitting people, but also thoughts of people doing those things to me. But I don't wish to think like that. I just want to be like everyone else, I don't enjoy being the way that I am. I don't feel like trying anymore. I'm probably going to take the easy way out. I've never really gotten along with my dad, but basically disowning me for an asthma attack that he could've prevented is crazy work. & my mom is going to be furious when I see her. She was texting me a little bit ago, & she said it's not my fault & that I can go home, but I know my mom because she's just like me, something will make her angry & I don't think I can handle that right now.

Now for the magic of the Ninja Airfryer! Most Ninja models with a dehydrate function work brilliantly for this.

 * Arranging on Trays: Lay your sliced mushrooms in a single layer on your Ninja Airfryer's dehydrating racks (or air fry basket if that’s what you’re using – though racks are better for airflow). Don't overcrowd them! Good air circulation is crucial for even drying. You might need to work in batches depending on how many mushrooms you have.

   * The thickness of your slices.

Part 5: Creating Wild Mushroom Powder.
Okay, team, now for the really exciting part – transforming these flavour bombs into an incredible mushroom powder! This is where the culinary magic happens.
 * Ensure They're CRISP Dry: For powder, your mushrooms need to be absolutely cracker-dry. If they have any bend or chewiness, they won't powder well. If needed, pop them back in the Ninja on dehydrate for another hour or two until they snap.
 * Choose Your Weapon (Grinder):
   * Spice Grinder/Coffee Grinder: A dedicated coffee grinder that you use only for spices is perfect for this. Don't use the one you use for coffee beans unless you want mushroom-flavoured coffee (or vice-versa!).
   * High-Powered Blender: A good quality blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec, or even the Ninja blender attachment if it's powerful enough) can also work, especially for larger batches. You'll need to use the smallest blending cup if possible for finer results.
 * Grind in Batches: Don't overload your grinder. Work in small batches for the finest, most consistent powder.
 * Pulse and Grind: Pulse a few times to break up the larger pieces, then grind until you achieve a fine powder.
   * Safety Tip: Let the powder settle in the grinder for a minute or two before opening the lid to avoid a mushroom dust cloud! You can even drape a damp paper towel over the lid as an extra precaution.
 * Sieve: For an ultra-fine powder, you can sift it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any larger bits. These can be re-ground or just tossed into your next soup.

 * Storing Your Mushroom Powder: Store your beautiful homemade mushroom powder in a small, airtight jar, again in a cool, dark, dry place. It's even more susceptible to moisture than whole dried mushrooms, so a good seal is vital. It will last for months, retaining amazing flavour.
Part 6: How to Use Your Wild Mushroom Powder (WFPB Style!).

1kzrr9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kzrr9h/my_mind_is_still_reeling_and_i_want_to_hear_your/,My mind is still reeling and I want to hear your thoughts on this one.,"I matched with a guy off hinge, we hit it off right away and were talking daily. Couple days in, he asked for my Snapchat, I obliged as I wasn’t thinking this was going to turn into anything serious. Not long after, maybe a day or two, we met up. He  came to my place and we spoke for a while, also engaged in sex which imo no biggie, again, I wasn’t thinking this was going to go far. 

Following that night, he continued to Snapchat me regularly, his responses were quick and he ended up asking for my Insta. Again, I obliged, he seemed alright and I was starting to like him. He then started to send me instagram reels, one after the other. The reels were quite relationship focused or like ‘I have a huge crush on you’, ‘me trying to get into your heart’ type vibe. At first I was like this is full on, I wouldn’t be doing this to people I’ve just met, yk. 

We see each other again, a couple nights in a row actually, him regularly sleeping over. During one of these times he pointed out that I never send him any instagram reels, I played it off like oh I don’t get cute ones that I can share (I did, but like, it’s too soon). I was then scrolling through my insta beside him and all these cute relationship type reels were popping up and he said something along the lines of, ‘see, why don’t you send me reels like this!’, it was said in a sort of excitable tone. Once he said that I thought to myself oh okay then, I’ll send you what you want type of thing. 

We continue seeing each other regularly, him coming over to mine and sleeping over after he finished work. We were still talking regularly on Snapchat and text, and still sending reels to one another. By the third week I was going interstate for that week. The messages/snaps/reels had slowed down a bit but I wasn’t fussed as I was spending time with family. We had agreed that he’d come see me once I was back home, we planned for the Saturday as he had plans Friday. 

Come end of the week, he said he would come over Friday now as his plans weren’t going ahead, I didn’t think too much into this because I was excited to see him. He came over and slept the night, all was well. On Saturday morning he said he had to go home and do some chores, and he’d come back Sunday night. I acknowledged this but also expressed I wish he could’ve stayed for the Saturday as we only ever saw each other at night. He didn’t say much to that but he did express a tiny tiny tiny amount of guilt. Come Sunday morning, he said he wasn’t feeling well and agreed he would keep me updated whether he was coming over or not. This was fine by me but I didn’t hear from him at all until 5pm when I messaged him saying we’ll cancel for the night as I hadn’t heard from him. He responded straight away apologising and he can come see me Monday morning. I said I’d think about it as I was a bit annoyed because I had seen his Snapchat score increase through the day yet he couldn’t even swing me a text saying ‘hey, still unwell, let’s reschedule’ until I said something first (I know l, I know.. my actions were not great, following his snapscore). 

Come Monday morning I was thinking I would like to see him as I was used to seeing him almost every night and with us having a week off from seeing one another, I just wanted to see him. So I messaged him asking if he’d still be keen to come over. He said yes but couldn’t stay for long. Fair enough, he had work and I was WFH, I can see now I probably should’ve just left it.

I asked when I could see him again next and we agreed Tuesday but would depend on his OT at work. I told him I didn’t mind him coming late so we could at least spend some time together. At this point I felt like I’d take anything just to see him. Again, he was terrible at communicating and at this stage, I really should’ve just let it be. 
He did end up coming over Tuesday night and he stayed over. He left early the next morning. Oh, I forgot to mention, prior to my interstate trip, the following mornings he slept over he would fill up my water bottle and/or make me a coffee, he would make sure I was good to start my day. It was sweet of him. This morning though, he just rushed out. This is really when I felt the shift.

That week he never snapchatted me, sent me maybe one reel and was barely responsive to my messages. At the end of the week I asked him about it, pointing out the fact that he was so communicative and present at the beginning, even telling me he deleted the dating apps, we also spoke about values one night when he was over which his response was communication and honesty, to now barely a peep. After my lengthy descriptive message, he sent me an audio message explaining he still likes me, he’s still interested in dating me but feels like he’s rushed into this and he’s not ready for commitment. He offered that we can either slow down or I can walk away (it was said nicely). Yeah, hard to hear and I told him I’d need to think about it. After some personal reflection I understood where he was coming from and appreciated the fact that he was honest, and to be fair, I didn’t want to rush either but I felt like he opened up the doors to it so I reciprocated. I was willing to give this a second chance but at a slower pace.

After a few days I let him know where I stood and I was willing to slow this down. I then get nothing from him and still haven’t heard from him. It’s been over a week now since his last message of still liking me and still interested, and offering to slow it down. 

Also, in the early stages he shared his location with me so I could always see where he was at. On my trip interstate I ended up doing the same. Just the other night I ended up removing him from socials and removing my location to bring me some peace. The morning after, I noticed he removed his location. 
I can admit I was getting very anxious about his actions and movements because he’d stop responding so I was checking his location every now and then. Look, I can acknowledge my actions were not great. But this makes me think he was doing the same of me? It’s such a coincidence that he stopped sharing his location within 12 hours or so after I stopped sharing mine, and he wouldn’t have been notified so he would’ve had to manually check my location, right?

I’ve been thinking about everything since it started, his actions and my own. I’ve learnt my lesson from this but I still wonder what the f is and was going through his mind? How can someone express so much to someone to then disappear. Oh! And in his last voice message he said this was love…. Yeah, umm, okay.

Anyway, would like to hear the opinion of others on this and what you think the type of person he is. Lacking emotional maturity for sure. Probably avoidant?

In positive news, what I have learnt is: 
- never give in too quickly when you’re not ready just to please someone else
- don’t take someone’s bare minimum effort to actually date you (coming over to watch something on TV every time shouldn’t be what the start of a relationship should look like imo)
- don’t give all your time to someone even if you think they’re worth it, always give time for yourself, your friends and/or family 
- save tough conversations for when you’re in person rather than text message.

I recently posted about budget espresso options,but based on comments it seems like I should wait for sometime before getting into a proper espresso.

So my next question is what to try after Moka Pot.

V60 or KaldiPress ?

I prefer medium roast iced americano produced by moka pot. Now I want something different.

* Between v60 and KaldiPress which one is more versatile?  

* Which is more rewarding in terms of experimentation?  

* I do not have any kind of kettle or flask, is goose neck kettle with thermostat important for v60? Is there a good budget kettle for v60?

* For a noob getting AeroPress over KaldiPress worth the price difference?",2,1748678230.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

I Work at Vostok Station in Antarctica. There Are STRANGE RULES We Must Follow.


I never applied for the job. That morning in late April 1983 started like any other. The sky was gray and overcast, the kind of dull weather that seeps into your bones in Leningrad. I was halfway through breakfast when there was a knock on my apartment door. I wasn’t expecting anyone. When I opened it, a man stood there. He wore a plain grey wool coat, his face unreadable. No introduction, no badge. Just a heavy envelope sealed with wax, which he handed to me without a word. Then he turned and disappeared down the hall like he was part of the shadows.
I stared at the envelope in my hands for a long moment before breaking the seal. Inside was a letter, typed neatly but cold, with no signature.
To: Viktor Andropov
You are hereby selected for mandatory reassignment to Vostok Research Station, Antarctica. You are to report to Sheremetyevo Airport, Moscow, on May 6th. All documents, travel, and provisions will be provided. This deployment is under Article 4 of the Scientific Advancement Mandate, Section 13B.
You do not decline.
Those last four words were stamped in red ink at the bottom.
I was a technician, nothing special, nothing high-ranking. Scientific background, sure, but that didn’t explain why I’d been chosen. I stared out the window, watching the dull city slowly wake up as I tried to make sense of what I’d just received. Part of me thought this was some sort of mistake. But in ’83, questions like that never got you anywhere.
I packed a small bag: warm clothes, a few books, my cigarettes, a notebook, and a worn photograph of my brother. I left a short note for my neighbor, just in case. Then I headed out.
Sheremetyevo Airport felt normal enough when I arrived. People bustled past in winter coats, dragging bags behind them. Flight announcements crackled over the speakers. The scent of hot coffee and stale pastries filled the air. Nothing seemed out of place—until I got closer to the Aeroflot check-in desk.
The clerk was a woman with tired eyes and pale skin. She barely glanced at me as I handed over my papers. Her hands shook slightly as she stamped my documents, but she didn’t say a word. I tried to catch her gaze, but she looked away quickly, her expression unreadable.
Behind me, a man coughed—dry, sudden, and harsh. Then it stopped as abruptly as it started. I didn’t dare look back.
The boarding call came earlier than expected. I walked to the plane—a bulky Antonov-12 that looked like it had been patched together over decades. Inside, the cabin was cramped and cold, the smell of oil and metal thick in the air.
There were only five passengers, including me.
A woman in her fifties wore a doctor’s badge pinned to her coat. She stared blankly out the window. A man dressed as a priest muttered prayers under his breath, his hands clenched tightly in his lap. A young soldier sat rigid, sweat gleaming on his brow despite the cold cabin. And another technician—I caught his eye once; he seemed as uncertain as I felt.
None of us spoke. We just sat, waiting as the engines roared to life and the plane began to taxi toward the runway.
The stewardess came around about an hour into the flight, her smile too wide, too forced. She handed out trays of food: boiled fish, black bread, and a strange pink gelatin that trembled like it was alive.
I asked what the gelatin was. She said, “Preserved protein. You’ll need it.”
I didn’t touch it.
The priest ate it all. Fifteen minutes later, his nose started bleeding—thick, black blood. No one said a word. Not even him.
An hour into the flight, the hum of the engines settled into a dull roar around us. The cabin’s cold air seemed to press in tighter with every passing minute. The stewardess returned, her smile never fading, carrying a thick folder.
She moved down the aisle with deliberate steps, then stopped beside me and handed it over wordlessly. The others received their copies too—though no one made a move to open them.
I cracked mine open. Inside were the rules. Typed and stapled, nothing handwritten. The font was sharp, precise. The heading read: “Vostok Station Transit Protocol.”
Rule 1: Remain seated and buckled during all phases of flight. Movement is permitted only during approved intervals.
Rule 2: Do not engage with other passengers unless necessary. Communication should be limited and formal.
Rule 3: Consumption of provided rations is mandatory unless medically unfit. Refusal must be reported immediately.
Rule 4: Use of electronic devices is prohibited. Unauthorized signals interfere with navigation and communication systems.
Rule 5: Any unusual behavior—violent outbursts, incoherence, or dissociation—must be reported to the crew immediately.
Rule 6: In the event of decompression, secure your oxygen mask first. Do not assist others until your own mask is secure.
Rule 7: No unauthorized access to cargo or crew areas. Security protocols are strictly enforced.
Rule 8: Medical emergencies must be reported via the intercom system. Self-treatment is discouraged unless explicitly trained.
Rule 9: Failure to comply with these rules will result in immediate containment upon arrival.
Rule 10: Remember—your compliance ensures your survival.
The last line was underlined twice in red ink.
I glanced around. The priest was already reading over his copy, lips moving silently. The doctor’s fingers trembled slightly as she flipped through the pages. The soldier just stared straight ahead, face pale and tight.
No one said a word. The silence stretched thick between us.
I folded the folder carefully and tucked it into my jacket pocket.
The stewardess came back with that same unnatural smile. “If you have questions, direct them to me,” she said softly. “But I assure you, these rules exist for your safety.”
I didn’t ask anything.
The hours stretched on. Outside the small windows, the endless gray clouds gave way to a featureless, icy expanse far below—a reminder that we were heading somewhere far from anything familiar.
The plane’s engines droned steadily as we neared the southern horizon. Outside, the endless gray sky began to shift, hues of icy blue and bleak white stretching out beneath us. I pressed my forehead against the cold window, watching the swirling clouds dissolve into a vast, frozen wasteland. Nothing moved down there—just jagged ice ridges and vast snowfields that looked like a frozen ocean.
Inside, the cabin had grown even colder. My breath fogged in the stale air. The priest was still muttering prayers under his breath, voice barely audible but relentless. The doctor stared at her hands, pale and shaking. The soldier hadn’t moved from his seat since the rules were handed out. The other technician had vanished sometime after the stewardess passed out the rules. No announcement, no explanation.
A low thud rattled the cabin as we hit some turbulence. The stewardess appeared instantly, her smile unchanged. “Please remain seated and buckle up,” she said softly, but her eyes flickered with something unreadable.
The intercom crackled. A voice, cold and clipped, broke the silence. “Attention all passengers: we are preparing for final descent. Please ensure all items are secured and your seat backs are upright. The temperature inside the cabin will drop further upon landing—dress warmly.”
The overhead lights dimmed, casting eerie shadows. The metallic scent in the air sharpened.
Minutes passed like hours.
Then, through the window, I saw it—a sprawling cluster of rusted buildings, half-buried in snow and ice, barely visible beneath the thick blanket of white. The plane banked slowly, descending toward that forsaken place.
The stewardess came by again, handing out small sealed packets of food. “Meal rations. Consume only what you need,” she said. Her smile never faltered, but there was a hint of urgency beneath it.
I tore open the packet. Inside was dry bread, some preserved meat, and a strange cube of gelatinous substance. It smelled faintly metallic, almost like rust and something else I couldn’t place.
The plane’s wheels touched down with a jarring bump, sending a shudder through the cabin. Outside, the wind howled, carrying a sharp, biting cold that seemed to claw at the very bones of the aircraft.
The pilot’s voice crackled over the intercom once more. “Welcome to Vostok Station. Please remain seated until disembarkation is announced. Weather conditions are severe. Proceed with caution.”
As the plane taxied toward the landing strip, I swallowed hard. I knew then that whatever awaited us at the end of this flight was unlike anything I’d ever faced before.
We came to a stop with a hiss of hydraulics and the soft groan of protesting metal. For a moment, no one moved. The silence in the cabin was heavy, stretched thin across the space like ice just beginning to crack. Outside, wind battered the fuselage, and the world beyond the windows had turned to a swirling blur of white.
Then came a sharp metallic clunk. The door at the front of the aircraft creaked open, letting in a vicious draft of cold that knifed through the cabin like a living thing. The stewardess stood by the exit, her too-wide smile replaced with a mask of blank professionalism. She gestured wordlessly toward the open hatch.
The soldier stood first, moving like a marionette on brittle strings. I followed, hoisting my suitcase—heavier now, somehow—and stepped into the howling wind.
The cold hit like a sledgehammer. I gasped, my breath freezing in midair. The snow beneath my boots felt unnatural—too soft, too deep, as though we were walking on ash rather than ice. The others staggered out behind me, hunched against the wind.
A tracked vehicle waited for us, its engine rumbling low. Its windshield was covered in ice, but the driver inside didn’t move to clear it. The door opened, and a man in a thick, full-body snowsuit waved us in. His face was hidden behind a frosted visor. He didn’t speak.
We climbed aboard, one by one, cramming into the cramped, freezing compartment. The door slammed shut, sealing us in with the engine’s rumble and the wet stench of melting snow and machine oil.
The driver put the vehicle into gear. We lurched forward into the blizzard.
Nobody spoke. Not during the first hour. Not during the second. The only sound was the drone of the engine and the occasional creak of the frame as the vehicle flexed over uneven ice. Through the fogged-up windows, I saw shapes—maybe rocks, maybe something else—looming and vanishing in the distance.
Around the fourth hour, the priest began to hum again. A different tune now—low and wavering, like a lullaby half-remembered from a nightmare.
The soldier flinched every time the vehicle bounced. His hand never left the grip of his sidearm.
The doctor had started whispering something in Czech, over and over. I couldn’t make out the words.
The heat in the cabin wasn’t working. Ice crystals formed in the corners of the glass. Our breath plumed in front of us like smoke.
At some point—six hours in, maybe seven—we passed what looked like a pole sticking out of the ground. A red flag fluttered weakly at the top, though there was no wind inside the vehicle. The technician beside me—the one who’d looked just as confused as I had on the flight—pressed his face to the window.
“There was someone out there,” he whispered.
I looked. Nothing. Just empty snow and fog.
He didn’t speak again.
Then we saw it.
Vostok Station.
It rose from the ice like a wound in the Earth—low, rusting structures hunched beneath layers of permafrost and darkness. Thick cables trailed from one building to another, sagging under the weight of frost. There were no lights, no sign of life. Just that endless, silent cold.
The vehicle came to a stop. The driver didn’t move. The door opened.
I stepped out.
The cold here wasn’t the same. It didn’t just burn—it pressed against you, into you, like it wanted to wear your skin.
The others followed, one by one. The technician slipped on the ice and didn’t get back up for a full minute.
No one helped him.

1kzrobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1kzrobs/how_i_lowered_my_ldlapob_by_almost_60_in_35_days/,How I lowered my LDL/ApoB by  almost 60% in 35 days with diet,"I am 35M, had an extensive blood panel in April and found out my total cholesterol is insanely high. It wasn't totally unexpected as I would normally eat 5-6 whole eggs scrambled in butter for breakfast, a 300g ribeye or other type of steak for lunch and tons of home made mayo that i make with like 15 yolks and 200ml of olive oil.

So, the test results were the following: 

Total cholesterol: 9.24 mmol/l
Triglycerides: 1.19 mmol/l
LDL: 8.24 mmol/l (for the US folks, I think that's over 330 in freedom units)
HDL: 1.68 mmol/l

I got freaked out and immediately started low fat diet, but repeated the test 4 days later to make sure it's not a mistake(also added vldl and APOB and APOA) :

Total cholesterol: 9.46 mmol/l
Triglycerides: 0.66
LDL: 8.61 mmol/l
HDL: 1.5 mmol/l
VLDL: 0.3 mmol/l
ApoB: 2.39 g/L
ApoA: 1.35 g/L

Immediately went to see a cardiologist. I'm lucky enough to have a friend whose father is a very good and open minded cardio surgeon and professor at the medical university, so I didn't have to wait long. He told me to try diet for a month or two to see how I respond to it and then put me on meds. My ECG was good, he also put me through a dobutamine stress test and was pleased with the results and my heart's performance. 


The diet:

Breakfast:

-10 scrambled egg whites
-2 small slices of whole grain bread (about 50 grams) made in the manner of french toast (dipped in the egg whites and seared on the pan with a little spray of avocado oil, about 2-3 grams)
-10 to 15 grams of organic (saying organic as I've seen almond butters with tons of unnecessary ingredients) almond butter spread on the toasts
-80 grams of blueberries or raspberries. 
-1 decaf coffee with 50ml of oatmeal milk and 10g of collagen peptides
-1 teaspoon of psyllium husk

Lunch

- 150-200 grams of baked chicken breast from pasture raised chicken. I choose pasture raised because it's drier, has a better omega 3 to omega 6 ratio, no antibiotics and of course tastes better (in my opinion)
- Carb which is usually baked mix of regular and sweet potatoes, basmati rice or blended lentils soup.
- Salad with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, half avocado, balsamic vinegar and 5-10g of home made extra virgin olive oil (my family has been making our own olive oil for over 6 generations) 
- Teaspoon of psyllium husk 

Dinner
- 200-250g of white fish fillet - usually bass, bream or fagri - whatever is the freshest wild catch when i go to the fish market
- Basmati rice or sweet potato
- Small green side salad with half avocado and 5-10g of olive oil and balsamic vinegar 
- Teaspoon of psyllium husk

Throughout the day I take 2 espressos with a splash of 1.5% cow milk or oat milk.

On 1 or 2 days per week I would swap the chicken breast for 150-200g of lean venison, horse or kangaroo steak. I prefer venison but the others aren't bad either. 

When I go out with family and friends I order whatever white fish the restaurant offers with steamed veggies as most other garnishes would often include questionable amount of oils, butter or dressings.

The supplements:

- 1500 mg berberine (500 mg with every meal)
- 1g of fish oil with every meal (500 EPA 250 DHA)
- 50 mg zinc bisglycinate
- 800mg magnesium (400mg citrate, 200mg bisglycinate and 200mg L-threonate)
- 1500mg turmeric
- 10g of collagen peptides, as mentioned in the food section
- 5-8g of creatine
- 10g of electrolyte pouder

Out of those only the berberine is new, as well as tripling the fish oil dose compared to before. I take the betberine as it helps with insulin sensitivity which I was worried abour when I started eating more carbs, it is also linked to LDL reductions but more studies have to come out to say for sure.

The exercise:

- 4-5 resistance training workours per week (3 for upper body and 1 or 2 for legs)
- 12k steps on average - some days more, some days (when it rains) less.
- I try to do zone 2 walks on at least 3 days of the week + HIIT once a week. 
- Sauna - 3-4 sessions of 20 minutes

Nothing new for me in terms of resistance training, steps are a bit higher than before and now I focus on zone 2 and hiit compared to the mostly recreational walks I did before.

For sauna i used to be on and off, but now I do it every other day. 


The ourcome:

I repeated the blood test 35 days after my first test and got the following results:
Total cholesterol: 4.79 mmol/l
Triglycerides: 0.5 mmol/l
LDL: 3.44 mmol/l
HDL: 1.4 mmol/l
ApoB: 1.03 g/L

I know it's not over and I have to keep working to lower these even more, but I feel like that's a big personal win for a month. I also realize it's not just about the things I ate, but also the things I stopped eating that made a bug difference.

I have an appointment with my cardiologist next week to discuss the results and what to do next.

I am open for a low dose of statin or  preferably nexlizet/repatha if i hit a plateau in the coming month or two, but I'll let my doctor decide.",2,1748678008.0,Cholesterol,1,1.0,False
1kzro7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kzro7l/james_hoffmanns_ultimate_v60_technique_very_fine/,James Hoffmann's Ultimate V60 Technique - Very fine grind size?,"Instead of using my usual technique, I just tried James original V60 technique (2 cups, 30g / 500ml) again, which is basically bloom + 1 pour (45s bloom with 60g, 45-1:15 pour to 300g, 1:15-1:45 pour to 500g). 

While I usually use 95 clicks on my K6 for the natural Ethiopian which I brewed, I went a good bit finer to 80 clicks for James technique. I finished pouring a little later than 1:45 and the draw down completed at 2:35. However James states that draw down should complete at around 3:30, and it feels like I have to go down to like 60 clicks or even less to get another minute of draw down, which already comes close to my usual moka grind size. 

To be fair the resulting coffee was a bit underextracted so prolonging the brew time makes sense, it just seems to be super fine. But then James often recommends to go as fine as possible to where it is not astringent yet.


Have you used very fine settings with a really slow draw down of like 1:45? 

I'll probably just try it out tomorrow or later but it really contradicts the ""go coarser"" mentality.

hi i'm shean 

I fell first, hindi ko rin alam kung bakit basta basta ko nalang nafeel na gusto ko siya, gusto ko siyang mahalin at baguhin. 

May 23, 2022 nung umpisa kaming mag usap, pinaramdam ko sakaniya na gusto ko siya, hindi niya rin ako nilandi nung una palang pero habang tumatagal pumapatol na rin siya. and yes, may nangyare saamin after 5months ng pag uusap o landian. nung gabing yon doon din lang nagkaroon ng label na official na kami. 

may mga gbf siya, alam ko yon nung una palang pero sinabihan ko siya na ayos lang basta alam nila boundaries nila sa isa't isa at ayaw ko yung may gbf siyang ex niya o may something sila dati. ilang beses akong nagtanong at humingi ng assurance sa bagay na yan pero patuloy niya rin naman akong binibigyan at sinasagot niya na wala naman daw siyang kaibigan na ex niya dati.

binigay niya acc niya, pero bago ko iopen yon sinabihan niya akong wag magbasa sa gc nila ng mga gbf niya at mga pm sa isa't isa. nagtaka ako at nag overthink dahil don kasi bakit niya naman ipagbabawal na magbasa ako ron sa gf niya ako diba? pero sinagot niya na para lang daw sa privacy, kasi nagkkwento mga gbf niya tungkol sa mga sex life nila. ako naman na tanga nirespeto parin yon kasi mahal ko nga at may tiwala ako kahit papano.

pero tangina, last year ko lang nalaman na ex niya pala yung isang gbf niya. sobrang may hinala na rin kasi ako non kasi ni ultimo sa panaginip may nagsasabi saakin na may ex siyang kaibigan niya parin hanggang ngayon, pero blurred yung mukha, short hair. yung girl na rin yon dun lang iba nag turing ng bf ko, nag cocomment siya sa mga tiktok vids ni girl na kusanh lumalabas sa fyp ko lol. 

nalaman ko yung bagay na yon kasi nakita ko sa convo ng ex ko at pinsan niya yung printed pics nilang nakapaskil sa wall nila sa isang bahay nila sa elyu. nung nalaman ko nung gabing yon sakto nasa elyu siya, nagbabakasyon. inopen ko agad sakaniya, hindi ako galit. nagtanong lang ako kung bakit tinago niya saakin, tinanong ko sakaniya kung bakit nagsinungaling pa siya kahit alam niya namang ikakasakit ko yon pag nalaman. alam niya rin na yun ang deal breaker ko, pati ang cheating.

pero mas nasaktan lang ako sa mga sagot niya, sinabihan niya ako na kasalanan ko naman daw kung bakit ako nasaktan kasi nag kalkal pa ako sa account niya. nakikipag hiwalay siya pero nag beg akong wag niya akong iiwan, pinatawad ko siya para lang hindi ako iwan kasi mahal ko nga. 

sobrang nasira ako nung gabing yon, wasak na wasak. inaway niya pa ako imbis na humingi ng tawad at magpaliwanag. 

pero kahit ganon ang nangyare pinatawad ko parin kasi inisip kong tapos naman na yon, inisip ko nalang at sinapuso yung sinasabi niyang ako naman na mahal niya, hindi mga ex niya o kung sino sa past niya. sadyang hindi niya nalang daw sinabi na ex niya yung girl kasi bata palang naman daw sila non (wtf nalang talaga)

natrauma ako sobra sa bagay na yon to the point na hindi ko nalang ulit binuksan fb acc niya para lang wala na ulit makita at malaman kasi mahal na mahal ko talaga e, antanga ko sobra.

after ilang months din ulit bago niya icut off mga gbf niya,  nag beg pa ako para dyan pero inabot pa ng months bago gawin. (ang sinabi kong icut off niya is yung ex niya lang, pero siya nagdesisyon na lahat sila icut off) 

nakita ko rin na nag aadd at accept siya ng kung sino sinong girl, as in lahat girl. sinabihan ko siya tungkol don na itigil niya kasi hindi maganda yon at micro cheating tawag don. nag agree naman siyang ititigil niya na.

may ilang beses nakita kong nilike niya post ng ex niya sa ig, sinabihan ko nanaman siya tungkol don na nasaktan ako kasi ex niya na yon bakit nag rereact parin. pati yung ex crush niya nilike niya rin post non at nakita ko rin na grineet niya ng ""happy birthday"" sa com sec.

may isa siyang kaklase nung grade 10, inamin niya saakin na fwb nila dati isa't isa nung grade 10 sila. 
pero tsaka niya lang inamin nung nahuli kong tinuruan niya mag floating yung girl nung may outing silang magkakaklase noon. napagselosan ko yung girl kasi sobrang dikit sakaniya, as in tumatambay pa sa kwarto ng ex ko dati. nakita ko rin na may ss ng story sa fb nung girl sa cp ng ex ko, at may stolen pic pa shutek e ni minsan hindi yon ginawa sakin dati ng ex ko bago ko pa siya utusan. nag cocoffee rin sila together at inaangkas sa motor at ginagawang passenger princess sa car kahit sinabi kong uncomfy na ako sa girl. at isa pa, pumayag na maging kabit yung girl dati sa isang boy kaya malandi talaga yon. dumating naman yung time na cinut off niya, inunfriend niya sa fb at inunfollow sa ig. pero kahit ganon ang ginawa niya sinama niya parin sa yearly dump yung pic nila together. (siya rin partner niya nung prom nila)

lahat yan binalewala ko, pinalampas ko kasi mahal ko nga. nagpauto rin ako sa mga pangako niyang hindi niya na ulit uulitin pang magtago sakin ng mga bagay na alam niyang makakasakit sakin, maliit man o malaki.

this year, parang nag iba ihip ng hangin. madaming nabago sakaniya, may mga lumala at may mga bagong bagay na nagagawa siyang nakasakit saakin.

palagi nanaman siyang nag iinom, nag punta siya sa bar kahit sinabihan ko siyang wag na pumunta sa kahit saang bar. hinayaan niya akong magtampo nung gabing yon, tumuloy siyang pumunta kasi nakakahiya raw sa tropa niya bday daw kasi ng gf non. (nasa baguio sila that time)

kinabukasan nung pagbabar nila, dumaan sa suggestions sa ig yung account ng dati niyang gbf, yung kaibigan ng ex niya. may story so pinindot ko kasi parang iba na nararamdaman ko e, parang may something. pagkaopen ko nung story, nasa bar si girl, pic ng alak na nasa table yung story niya. wala naman mukha ng kahit sino pero tinanong ko parin ex ko, dineny niya, hindi niya raw nakasama.

so pinalampas ko kasi wala naman akong matibay na proof na nagsama sila e. btw, kuya nung girl yung tropa ng ex ko na kasama niya that time kaya sobrang lakas talaga ng feeling na nakasama niya si girl. 

nung holy week nagbakasyon ulit siya sa elyu, may isang coffee shop siyang pinuntahan kasama yung tropa na nakasama niya rin sa bar. kinabukasan nanaman non, nagpakita nanaman account nung girl na may story din kaya pinindot ko ulit. yung story niya is pic ng foods at drinks na same sa coffee shop kung saan nagpunta yung ex ko. nung inopen ko sakaniya yon, hindi niya na dineny. kasi kung tutuusin sobrang tibay na na proweba yon. 

nagtampo ako malala, sinabihan kong walang wala na akong maiooffer pang iba sakaniya kasi nagagawa niyang itago sakin yung bagay na yon, walang sawa naman siyang nanlambing pero kinabukasan nakikipag hiwalay siya sakin.

nilalambing niya naman na raw ako pero di parin daw ako nagpapatinag, ayaw niya na raw akong saktan ulit kaya gusto niya nang tapusin relasyon namin. ako na tanga nag beg kahit ako yung nasaktan dahil sa ginawa niya. 

isa rin sa nabago sakaniya is yung tungkol sa pag a-update niya, kulang kulang mga sinasabi niya kahit hindi naman siya ganon dati. may mga bagay siyang ginagawa at pinupuntahan, pero sinasabi niya lang sakin after na ng lahat ng yon. syempre nakiusap nanaman ako na kung pwede wag ganon kasi nag aalala ako at naghihintay sakaniya, mas mabuti na yung nagpapaalam siya bago niya gawin para alam kong safe siya.

nagalit siya nung una pero unti unti kong pinapaintindi sakaniya na nag aalala lang ako. pero ewan, maayos siya ngayong araw pero kinabukasan wala nanaman. paulit ulit lang lahat.

tuwing sinasabihan ko siya tungkol sa mga bagay na kelangan niyang baguhin, palagi rin siyang nakikipag hiwalay. sinasabi niyang wala na raw progress relasyon namin, siya pa talaga may ganang sabihin yon e siya nga yung hindi nagbabago.

sinabihan niya akong sabihin lang sakaniya mga kelangan niyang gawin at baguhin para hindi niia na ako masaktan, para matuto siyang mahalin ako nang tama. pero nung sinabi ko sakaniya lahat pinafeel niya lang na napaka demanding ko, kahit bare minimum hindi niya maibigay. 

may mga gabing nag ooverthink parin ako kasi what if ginagawa niya parin yung mga bagay na ayokong gawin niya sa fb niya, yung mga pag mmicro cheating niya. so kinukuha ko ulit fb account niya, kinausap ko siya nang maayos habang hinihingi yung bagay na yon pero nagalit lang siya. sinabi niyang magkakalkal nanaman daw ako para may mapag awayan nanaman daw, ang sabi ko naman, wala namang mapag aawayan kung wala naman siyang ginagawang masama o tinatago sakin. 

pero kahit anong pagbbeg ko hindi niya binigay, hinayaan ko nalang ulit kasi mahal ko e, kahit papano laki parin ng tiwala ko sakaniya. 

pero dahil sa mga pinapakita at pagttrato niya sakin, nung May 26, hiniram ko dummy account ng kaibigan ko para ichat ex ko, loyalty test kumbaga. hindi niya ako tinulungan nung humihingi ako ng tulong para sa peace of mind ko e, edi ako nalang gagawa ng bagay para mapatunayan lahat ng hinala ko kung mali ba o tama

nag hi ako sa chat, nagreply naman siya na kinagulat ko. kasi dati bago siya magreply sa kung sino sinasabi niya muna sakin at nagpapaalam kung pwede replyan yon. 

sinabi ko sa chat na interested akong makilala siya ganto ganyan, na hindi niya naman nireplyan yung chat kong yon para sagutin kung pwede ba o hindi, kasi nga may gf na siya

inuuna niya pang replyan yung dummy account kesa sakin. nasa inuman nanaman siya that night, sinabi niyang di siya makakareply sakin. pero tangina bakit nagrereply sa dummy account? so dun palang grabe na yung sakit na nararamdaman ko whdnhs

kinwento niya naman sakin na may nagcchat sakaniya.  may weirdo raw na nagcchat sakaniya, naiinis daw siya. ako naman patay malisya syempre, tinanong ko kung bakit naging weirdo yung nagcchat sakaniya, kung bakit niya nireplyan, kung bakit hindi niya agad kinwento sakin, kung lalake ba o babae yon

pero ang sagot niya lang sakin, akala niya raw kakilala nung kakilala niya kasi mutuals sila sa dummy account ko. 

ang sabi ko rin sakaniya hindi naman siya sure, kahit makita man niyang mutual friend nung dummy acc yung kakilala niya, bakit niya parin nireplyan? hindi naman dapat replyan yon lalo na't random girl. 

pinapasend ko sakaniya screenshot ng buong convo, pero hindi niya sinend. wala lang naman daw yon at hindi importante bakit isesend niya pa, wala naman daw makikita. ang sabi ko naman, kung ""wala lang"" yon bakit hindi niya kayang isend sakin? mas napapaoverthink lang ako kako

pero wala, hindi nagpatinag. siya pa ang galit.

ang sinend niya lang na screenshot is yung huling convo nila. ang masakit pa ron, may dinelete siyang chat nung dummy account which is yung tinanong ko sakaniya if interested din ba siyang makipag usap sa chat. 

inaway ko nanaman at pinilit na isend ang buong convo nila, pero wala parin nangyayare. kaya hindi ko na siya nireplyan muna ng halos mag iisang oras ata that time para mag isip isip ng desisyon.

sa huli, pinili ko parin na iend nalang relasyon namin, kasi hindi ko na kayang itolerate pang mmicro cheating niya, mga pananakit niya, mga pangako niyang napapako. 

sakit lang talaga, hindi niya manlang nagawang mag beg sakin ni isang beses para lang hindi ko siya iwan. wala manlang akong natanggap na pagsisisi sa ginawa niya sakin, reply niya agad sa long message ko about sa pakikipag break sakaniya ""okay"" 

kung hindi pa ako gagawa ng way para maconfirm panggagago niya sakin, mananatili akong bulag. ansakit magmahal ng isang tao kapag hindi niya kayang alagaan din nararamdaman mo. 

nag end kami nang maayos kahit papano kasi diko naman pinaramdam na galit ako sakaniya, mabait parin ako, winiwish ko parin na maging mabuti kalagayan niya kahit papano. sinabi niya sakin na kelangan niya muna maging better para deserving na rin daw siya sakin. naniwala naman ako, naniwala naman akong yan ang dahilan kung bakit hinayaan niya lang akong iwan siya.

ilang araw after ng break up namin, nakita kong nag react sa sp ng ex ko yung isang girl na naging cause rin ng pag ooverthink ko.

 finollow niya yon sa ig dati, tinanong ko kung sino at bakit finollow niya yon. ang sagot niya lang sakin hindi niya raw alam kung pano niya finollow yon, hindi niya raw kilala. ano yon? kusang pinindot ng kamay niya habang tulog? inunfollow niya naman agad, binigyan ako assurance para hindi na mag overthink so pinalampas ko ulit yon. 

pero nalaman kong kaibigan ng kaklase ng ex ko yung girl, so pumasok sa isip ko na nakilala niya yung girl dahil don sa tropa niya. ang masakit pa rito, kung saan nag ggym yung ex ko, doon din nag ggym yung girl so dagdag overthink nanaman kasi kahit nakiusap akong lumipat nalang siya ng gym kasi uncomfy ako, hidni niya parin ginawa. 

pinalampas ko nalang ulit lahat yan, kasi mahal ko nga at may tiwala ako, sobrang bait at tanga ko, aaminin ko yan. 

so eto na nga, nung gabing nakita ko yung pagreact nung girl sa sp ng ex ko, chinat ko siya. tinanong kung bakit naging friend niya yon sa fb ngayon e dati naman hindi. ang sagot niya sakin, nakipag hiwalay naman na raw ako bakit cinocontrol ko parin siya, bakit demanding parin daw ako. sinabi niya sakin na he can do whatever he wants kasi wala naman na raw kami.

so ako, mas nasaktan. kasi hindi naman pagdedemand at pagcocontrol yon, sinasabi at pinapafeel ko lang sakaniya na akala ko kaya hindi niya ako hinabol nung nakikipag hiwalay ako kasi gusto niya muna maging better, gusto niya muna magbago. 

sinabi ko sakaniya na nakipag hiwalay ako para magbago siya, hindi palalain mga maling ginagawa niya. nakipag hiwalay ako para matuto siyang itigil nga bagay na naging dahilan kung bakit ako lumisan.

pero wala e, kahit gaano ko ipaintindi ko sakaniya wala parin nangyayare. 

kaya ayon, i feel so betrayed...

sinabi niya rin sakin na pagod na raw siya maghintay sakin. so ganto, strict kasi parents ko kasi only child ako, bawal talaga ako mag bf pero pinaglaban ko siya kasi mahal ko nga. natanggap naman ng parents ko relasyon namin, ayaw lang nila yung nagkikita kami o lumalabas labas na kaming dalawa lang, angbgusto nila tuwing may okasyon lang. so ako syempre sumama loob kahit papano kasi gusto ko nga rin maksama ex ko nang kaming dalawa lang, para mas maenjoy din namin kasi walang nagbabantay na magulang.

sinabi niya sakin na hindi niya raw magawang isurprise ako, igala, ganto ganyan. na nagawa naman namin, nagawa niya naman akong isurprise, nagawa niya namang pumunta rito sa bahay kahit wala siyang pinagsasabihan ni isa samin ng mga parents ko, so ano yung mga sinasabi niya ngayon? nakalimutan niya na lahat lahat ganon?

kung ikukumpara yung mga nakaraang taon namin kesa ngayong taon, mas nagkikita talaga kami madalas ngayon, kaya may part sakin na hindi naniniwalang hindi niya na ako mahintay kaya hindi niya na ako hinabol nung nakipag hiwalay ako sakaniya.

inaamin kong hindi pa ako nakakamove on, kahit grabe panggagago niya sakin mahal ko parin siya. hindi ko madelete pics namin sa social media, wala akong pinagsasabihan kahit kanino, kaming dalawa lang may alam ng break up namin. hindi ko masabi sa mga magulang ko kasi hindi ko pa kaya, hindi ko pa kaya magkwento kahit sa kaninong kakilala ko.

pero siya, nagawa niyang idelete post niya, featured niya na kasama ako. nung mismong gabing nakipag hiwalay ako, ganon lang kadali sakaniya...

balak ko lang na magdelete kapag nakamove on na ako o sadyang kelangan na talaga mag delete, tama pa ba 'to?

We (me and the wife) are looking to get a coffee machine for our usage. Mostly will be used to make cappucino and espresso. Post research last year (basically finding that you need at least 10 bar for good extraction), we got the Kaff Fontana coffee machine for my parents. They really like it btw.  
But wife doesn't want same product for our home (understandable) and prefers a 2 in 1 (pods/capsule + powder). I argued on the 2 in 1 part that A, pods/capsule can become useless if the brand stops making compatible ones and B, we can save money by getting a powder only machine.   
My query is, we want a no nonsense, great machine that can give us the best coffee, on a budget. Our budget is max 15-17k, can stretch to 20 if the machine is tried and tested and is really better than the ones cheaper. Wife has shared the Noire Azure Coffee maker (12k on Amazon). Will something like the DeLonghi EC685 Dedica be much better than Noire? And which one would have good after sales, in case it goes kaput in some time (I saw a v bad review of Ideal Brew machin on Amazon). Kindly ask any questions that need answering in comments.

I’ve been to her house many times, eaten with her family, had drinks, met her boyfriends, and even attended group meetings for Nar-anon which is a 12 step group for the family and friends of addicts. So she’s not the addict, she goes to the program to deal with an ex who was an addict. I go regarding my dad’s addiction.

Tonight she called me and said her family had thrown her and her shoes out their door because she didn’t want to stay at home after she had surgery. So she got her ex husband to pick her up, but not before she called me (I drive for uber full time). 

So she said she needed a friend and I went over there. The story sounded weird and I found myself wondering why they would do that. So we went to get coffee (after first driving somewhere else first) and she basically launched into a tirade. This is what it consisted of:

That the musician Vessel from Sleep Token was actually channeling messages from Michael the Archangel. She went into great detail about how when he was a child Michael revealed himself to Vessel and instead of him singing about the entity Sleep(which IS the actual lore of the band) she is convinced he is channeling messages of God.

She stated that our step 3 in our program which is that we turn our will and ourself over to a higher power, has manifested in her knowing and being gifted with this insight. She said she was closed off to it before and only once she opened herself up to it, did it all start to make sense. 

Some other red flags 🚩 

A bunch of shit was in her driveway that she frantically pulled out of her garage to make room for a brand new Mercedes she bought this week

She states that ever since her spiritual awakening she has been gifted with a different and more commanding voice and now she’s going to be a singer.

She has stated that Vessel from sleep token is her soul mate and is convinced that she will meet him and they will make music together.

There’s been some other stuff in there too, but yea to say I’m concerned is an understatement.

She’s building a business (although she’s been doing this for quite a while), and I know recently her bf broke up with her. Someone from her job said she was “going through it” at work. I know this because I had dinner with her and her friend and her work friend said this to the table

And I know that her daughter and ex husband who live with her are moving in a month.

She has always had some off the wall spiritual beliefs, I do too (I’m a witch) but this is way different. I don’t want to stand in the way of a spiritual awakening but I’m concerned there’s more going on. 

I asked her if she had bipolar in her family and she sighed and said that’s what her ex-husband said to her and he almost called the cops on her. I’m like… ok so I’m not the only one then. 

But it was impossible to get a word in edge wise when we were at dinner. She’s convinced she has the ability to command people to do things and they’ll do it. She is rather imposing and intense, but I feel like she’s gone from assertive to kind of delusional. 

She said that she did not have bipolar in her family and it wasn’t that. And that if she gets depressed suddenly then we can take her to the hospital. 

Idk what all to do here? Like, I called her on this stuff and she dismissed it all. We aren’t besties, although I think she thinks we are closer than we are. She made a big todo on the way to the Diner tonight that if someone doesn’t “walk in the light” she can’t have them around her, and that she would have no issues completely removing someone from her life. 

I walked away from that whole conversation not feeling like I had gotten through to her, and just kind of accepting that this is how she feels about shit. 

She’s in psychosis or something. My mom was bipolar and was unmedicated most of my childhood. I’m noticing some shit. But I’m not a damn doctor, so I don’t wanna say that’s what this is. She wouldn’t do drugs afaik. 

I mean if her family won’t even deal with her….Some of her explanations sound kind of reasonable tho? 🤷🏼‍♀️ like she acknowledged that she sounded crazy but she wasn’t, and I was like “is this why your family threw you out?” She said no, she doesn’t tell her family this stuff. 

She said demons were following her home, and I’m like…. Wut 👹

I left feeling so anxious. I don’t know what my place is here? Can I have some advice? Should I fuck off? I mean her ex-husband is aware and he lives in the home with her.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated. ""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible. ""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said. ""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry. ""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin."" ""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. 

That's not something she should do."" I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin. ""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town."" ""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience. ""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior."" ""I'm what?"" 

I thought I had heard wrong. ""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong. ""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying. ""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final."" ""But, Dad..."" ""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument. I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future. At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. 



So they agreed that I should take advantage of it. ""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging. I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city. ""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!"" I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. 

On Saturday, we got ready at her place. ""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?"" ""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

 ""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind."" When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said: ""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat."" ""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?"" Chapter 2 There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear: ""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan. Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. 

When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice: ""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?"" ""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him. It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting. ""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!"" ""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority. ""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party."" ""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too."" ""Lucky me!"" ""And why's that?"" I smiled. ""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted. ""Even with the mask?"" ""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful."" ""You're such a charmer."" ""You think I'm charming?"" ""You know you are. And handsome too."" ""I'm glad you like what you see."" ""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" -

 I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet. ""Are you okay?"" ""I think I need some air."" ""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes. He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. 

I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist. ""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle. ""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?"" ""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment. 

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically. We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us.

 I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me. We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said: ""You're truly amazing!"" He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear: ""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know. Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying: ""What did you say?"" 

At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party. Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway. I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me: ""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" 



I laughed, and she laughed with me. ""When we get home, I want to know everything!"" ""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes. ""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?"" ""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water. ""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit. We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding: ""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything."" I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked: ""You guys used protection, right?"" My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down: ""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!"" Chapter 3 On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused. ""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile. I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests. I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver. 

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me. The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes: ""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent.

 You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself."" I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued: ""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care..."" I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating: ""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!"" How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly: ""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. 



I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?"" I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively. We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said: ""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love."" Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs: ""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!"" She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. 

Mel immediately supported me and said: ""Let's go then, I'm with you!"" When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried: ""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?"" ""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both."" My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. 



The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that. Finally, my father spoke: ""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back."" My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said: ""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags..."" ""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope. ""But Dad, I brought shame to you..."" ""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out."" Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents: ""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around."" My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

 As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me. The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory. Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed. But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out. My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. 



They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love. I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man! My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. 

Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons. After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything. 

Chapter 4 When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him. After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. 

I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice. I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying: ""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview."" ""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again. I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name: ""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group."" He smiled: ""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief. That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day. At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said: ""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?"" ""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today? ""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?"" ""No, ma'am. Everything is clear."" ""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday."" She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out. I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me: ""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?"" This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked: ""Mel, what about Fred?"" ""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. 

Friend, it's a new life for all three of us."" I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said: ""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!"" I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good. 

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road. We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center. The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk. I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. 

I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me. Chapter 5 I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president. Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule. ""So you have a child. 

How old is he?"" she asked with a smile. ""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!"" ""What's his name?"" ""Peter."" ""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said: ""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush."" I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare. Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day. Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon.

 I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice: ""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?"" I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice: ""Put Mariana on."" I was startled but kept my composure and replied: ""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?"" ""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently. ""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant."" ""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word. ""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?"" ""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office."" ""Certainly, sir. And your name is?"" ""Looks like I'm your boss!"" 

He snapped and hung up. Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked: ""Was he calm?""

 I looked at her and couldn't help myself: ""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck."" She burst out laughing and then said: ""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it."" I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!",1,1748677503.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1kzrjjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1kzrjjx/does_anyone_have_this/,Does anyone have this,"I was falsely accused of having an affair by my step-sister, and my mate, refusing to listen to my explanations, forcibly cut open my belly, extracting my unborn child before it was full term. Blood gushed out in torrents, and I thought my life was ending right then. But when I opened my eyes again, I had been reborn to the day before my 18th birthday.
Determined to avoid the tragic end of my last life, I fled to the pack ruled by my biological father. However, to my shock, I discovered a startling secret about my last life here...
**
“Please don’t do this.” I begged over and over, but no one was listening. I thrashed against their hold, but nothing. “I am your luna.” I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. “Luke please.” I begged once more time, my voice horse.

“Kill it once it’s done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.”

He can’t mean that. This was our baby. “Our baby.” 

“Is a mistake from the moon goddess. One I will rectify.” His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn’t even face me. 

“Now do it. That’s an order.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

It was a mistake to come here. 

It was a mistake to give him everything. 

“Oh, and doctor?” Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. “Don’t use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.”

“Yes, Luna.” The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was in trouble. 

I’m sorry, baby. Momma couldn’t save you. She wanted you so, so much. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade. 

“Silver?” My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn’t want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. But I never touched another wolf, nor would I again, not after this betrayal. 

Why, Moon Goddess, why would you give him to me just to take him away? My pup.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us. 

“Bring me the body of the pup.”

“Yes Alpha.” I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I started to scream, soon I felt the blvvd trickling down my side, every drip off of me hitting the floor. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak. 

I’m sorry, baby.

They weren’t trying to keep me alive, which I expected, but I wished wasn’t true. I used to love my mate, but I felt the love die in me when I saw my pup being ripped from my belly.

“Please, let me hold him once.” I tried to move my arms to reach for him, but I was still tied down. The doctor, who was shedding tears, brought my pup and laid him on my chest. 

He was perfect. I rubbed his scent on my face and mine on his. He would forever be a part of my soul. 

My missing piece. 

“Doctor, now.”

“Yes Alpha.” The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements. 

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place. 

“I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. And I have, over and over, since he found out of your betrayal.” 

Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. “He is perfection. And don’t worry. I will give him another son.” She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. “What’s so funny?”

“I can smell the beta on you. That’s Derek’s child, and it’s a girl. Nice try though.”

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again. 

“You s1vt!” He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room. 

“Brandon!” Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. “What’s wrong?” She staggered to her feet, but more blvvd dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

“You lied!” He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver traveling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. “This was my pup. I can smell me on him. He was mine.” Brandon’s eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. “You said she cheated on me and that it wasn’t my pup.”

“She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.”

“You said you smelt it.” From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. 

And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon. 

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls. 

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup. 

“Save her.”

“No!” Shannon screamed. “I am the Luna now, you marked me last night.” Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. His betrayal had bile shoot into my mouth. “I am bearing your pup.”

I started to laugh again. I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, lingering next to me. “Stay with me Amy.”

“Beta’s baby. She is with…the beta.” I choked out the words and laughed as horror bloomed in his eyes. Blvvd flew from my mouth as I smiled again. 

“Save her.”

“No!” I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. “Don’t move.” I used my Alpha strength to freeze everyone, including my mate. 

“How?” Brandon looked down at me, pleading. “Let me save you.”

“I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don’t deserve to save me. You don’t deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything.” I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body. 

And then I was free.

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. 

“Amy hurry, you’re going to be late.” I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? “Amy!” The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn’t stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother’s arms. “Mom, you’re here.” I started to cry. “I’ve missed you so much.”

“Amy. My girl.” She laughed as she patted my back. “I saw you yesterday.” She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. “Happy birthday, baby.”

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. “Thank you, mom.”

“Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life.” She smiled at me and I felt my blvvd freeze. I didn’t want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

“I’d rather stay here with you.” I smiled as I kissed her cheek. “I don’t want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he killed my baby and me. He killed my mother for her involvement. Shannon’s father, my mother’s husband, watched her die. Don’t get me wrong I knew he loved my mother, and he was hurting, but his scheming daughter was the cause of all of this. He stood by and watched it all happen.

I understood why he supported his daughter, but I didn’t like it, nor him, for that matter.

“Baby. You won’t miss us. We will be there every step of the way.” She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

“Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy’s pack?” My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn’t a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. But he swore it was a mistake. It was another Alpha’s maneuverings to break them up, but my mother said it didn’t matter. It was too late.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

“No baby. I can’t go back.” My mother’s face fell as she turned away.

“I don’t want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don’t want a mate.” I whispered my new truth.

“Mates don’t hurt each other, baby.” She tried to smile but I shook. I knew exactly what mates do to each other.

“Would you be made if I refused my mate?”

“God no baby. The Moon Goddess makes a path clear, but it is up to us to choose it. If you don’t want your mate, you can reject him.”

“And if it is the Alpha’s son?”

My mother looked at me. She knew that if it was the Alpha’s son, I would be in trouble. They wouldn’t allow me to leave. An Alpha has to mate his first mate, even for a day to come into his full power. “What do you know?” I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. “I don’t know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon’s boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta.” I pulled back. “I don’t want this for me.”

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. “Okay baby. But you can’t leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.”

I tossed my hands in the air. “How would I do that?”

“There is much you don’t know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure…” She trailed off and I just nodded my head. “Then let me make a few calls. You don’t have to go to school today.”

I lept back into her arms. “Thank you, mom. I don’t know what I would do without you.”

“I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you.” She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.
I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I rubbed my flat stomach. “Don’t worry, my pup. This time around, no one will hurt you.”

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn’t do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

“I’m telling you, if she is Brandon’s mate, I’m going to kill her.”

“You can’t mean that, Shan.” The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon’s best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

“Of course I do. Brandon is mine.”

“Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.”

“You shut your mouth, Megan.” Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. “He’s mine.”

“Whatever I gotta go. Hurry up before I leave you behind,” Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

“What do you think you’re doing in my closet?”

“Amy?” Shannon’s mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

“You’re lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to kill me. Didn’t I hear that correctly? A beta’s daughter threatening an alpha.” I tsked.

“I didn’t do anything.” She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

“Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal.” I couldn’t stop my grin as I felt her tremble. “Did you threaten me?”

“Yes.” she screamed at me. “You’re going to take Brandon from me.”

“I don’t want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him.” I pushed her away. “Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you.” I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

“What is your problem?”

“You. Now leave.” I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Stupid woman. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that had happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

“Pack your bags, Amy.” My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making. 

“What?” I looked up. “Why?”

“You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha.” Mom smiled down at me. “Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.”

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. “I can go?”

“Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.”

I pouted. “Mom, I really don’t want to be here.” I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn’t risk him finding me.

“It’s okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad.” She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. “Now get ready.”

“Okay mom.” I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open. 

“I knew it.” I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

“Shannon, why are you screaming?” Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room. 

“I’m not Brandon’s mate, daddy.” Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms. 

“How are you so sure?” Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

“It’s you. You stupid wh0'Re.” Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

“Amy!” Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked. 

“Morgan, you can’t yell at Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first.” My mom placed my breakfast on the table. “Amy, 
Come eat. You have a long day ahead.”

“Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?”

“She is going away for the summer. To her fathers.” My mother turned to me and opened her arms. “Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.”

I walked over and sat down, and dug in. 

“Why is she going to her dads?” Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up. 

“She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?” My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn’t know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it. 

“Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven’t seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom.” I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled. 

“You’re leaving?” Shannon stood up.

“Yup. I’ll be gone the full summer.” I smirked over at her. “But my room is locked, and it will stay that way.” My smile dropped 
away as I stared at her and used my alpha command. 

“Amy!” Morgan yelled out. “You know you’re not allowed to alpha command your step sister!” 

“And I wouldn’t have Morgan, if I hadn’t found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet.” I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie. 

“Is that true?” Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

“I wouldn’t lie. I’ll just command you to tell the truth.” She screeched and stomped her foot.

“Yes!” she screamed. “Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon’s mate.”

“How?” I threw up my hands, playing like I didn’t know the truth. “How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.”

“Because he scented you on me!” Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

“Calm down. You’re hurting everyone’s ears and just explain yourself.” My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

“Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy’s dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I’m not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me.” Shannon pouted.

“So he likes the way I smell, doesn’t mean we are mates.” I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn’t accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

“Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell.” Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. “He’s the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her.” She pointed to me. 

I scoffed. “I don’t want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day in hell before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon.” I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves. 

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It’s said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs. But either way, I wasn’t lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon’s vicinity.

“You’re lying. He’s the alpha.”

“And?”

“Everyone wants to be the luna.”

“Idiots want to be the luna.” I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

“That’s for you.”

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely taken a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver’s arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. “Hey love bug.”

“Uncle Ronnie. I’ve missed you.” I climbed over the seats and sat up front. “What are you doing here?” Ronnie was my dad’s beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life. 

“You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.” 

“Dad sent you?” I laughed.

“Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da.” He smiled over and laughed with me. “As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.” 

“He didn’t have to.” I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt. 

“Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you’re sending in the summer. What’s going on?” My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head. 

“I don’t want to be here.”

“Why?”

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. “I’m afraid that my mate is here and I don’t want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.”

“Why wouldn; t you want your mate?” My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport. 

“I’ll tell both you and dad, just not now.” My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding. 

“Fine, but I want the full story.”

“You will get it, I swear.” I nodded back to the road. “Now focus on driving so you don’t kill us.” I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane. 

Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. “I just worry about you, pup.” I couldn’t stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

“I know you do.” I settled back into my seat and sighed. “I promise, what happened isn’t going to make that feeling any better.” I wiped at my face. “I don’t even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.”

“Well, let’s hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar.” My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time. 

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. “Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours.” My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

“Work?”

“Work.” He nodded. 

“This summer, can you teach me some stuff?” A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself free from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

“Of course, Sugar.” My uncle smiled up at me. “You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were 
open to it.”

“I asked to move to your pack.” I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

“What is going on?” His eyes flashed.

“I’ll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.”

“Of course, Sugar.” He smiled and then turned back to the laptop. “Now get some sleep.”

“Will do.” I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly. 

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. “We are here.” 

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. “Okay.” I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. “Thank you.”

“No problem, Princess.” The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

“You don’t have to call me Princess.”

“You are the Alpha’s daughter.” She bowed and then left us to our own devices. 

“Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing.” Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. “You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.”

“I know. But Alpha Vince won’t allow me to leave…” I looked over and blew out a breath. “I think he assumes something I am 
running from and won’t let me leave until he knows for sure.”

“You going to tell me yet, Sugar.”

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

“Dad.”

“Hey my pup.” His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

“I’ve missed you.” I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

“As I have missed you.” He kissed my temple. “Now we have much to discuss.” He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind. 

“Slow down. Some of us can’t move that fast.” Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father’s office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

“Tell me what’s wrong, pup.” I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. 

“Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.”

“Agreed Sugar.”

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said. 

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.",1,1748677454.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

Most often, I go to sea in the morning when there are no waves at all, or not big and the sun is not so dangerous yet. As a rule, I go 500-700 meters from the shore, ride a couple of kilometers on the SUP along the coast, then come back and spend the remaining time away from the shore, away from the noise of people in clean and beautiful water.. drinking coffee, eating watermelon, listening to music, swimming. To avoid being carried away by waves and currents, I also want to buy a folding anchor. I don't know which SUP to buy for this. In my country I can buy the sup from Aqua Marina, a large selection of models of the F2 brand, there is WattSUP, Coasto, STX, Aztron.
I am also interested in what shape the nose of the SUP should be: wide round or, on the contrary, narrow and sharp to cut the wave and to sway less. How many fins should there be at the back?",1,1748677441.0,Sup,0,1.0,False

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.



""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.



""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.



""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.



""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""



""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""



I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.



""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""



""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.



""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""



""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.



""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.



""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.



""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""



""But, Dad...""



""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.



I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.



At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.



""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.



I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.



""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""



I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.



""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""



""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""



""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""



When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:



""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""



""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""



Chapter 2



There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:



""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.



Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:



""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""



""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.



It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.



""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""



""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.



""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""



""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""



""Lucky me!""



""And why's that?"" I smiled.



""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.



""Even with the mask?""



""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""



""You're such a charmer.""



""You think I'm charming?""



""You know you are. And handsome too.""



""I'm glad you like what you see.""



""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.



""Are you okay?""



""I think I need some air.""



""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.



He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.



""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.



""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""



""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.



Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.



We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.



We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:



""You're truly amazing!""



He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:



""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.



Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:



""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.



Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.



I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:



""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.



""When we get home, I want to know everything!""



""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.



""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""



""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.



""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.



We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:



""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""



I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:



""You guys used protection, right?""



My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:



""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""



Chapter 3



On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.



""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.



I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.



I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.



So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.



The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:



""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""



I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:



""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""



I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:



""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""



How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:



""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""



I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.



We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:



""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""



Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:



""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""



She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:



""Let's go then, I'm with you!""



When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:



""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""



""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""



My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.



Finally, my father spoke:



""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""



My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:



""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""



""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.



""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""



""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""



Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:



""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""



My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!



As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.



The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.



Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.



But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.



My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.



I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!



My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.



After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.



Chapter 4



When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.



After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.



I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:



""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""



""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.



I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:



""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""



He smiled:



""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""



I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.



That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.



At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:



""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""



""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?



""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""



""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""



""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""



She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.



I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:



""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""



This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:



""Mel, what about Fred?""



""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""



I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:



""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""



I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.



The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.



We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.



The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.



I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.



Chapter 5



I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.



Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.



""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.



""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""



""What's his name?""



""Peter.""



""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:



""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""



I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.



Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.



Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:



""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""



I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:



""Put Mariana on.""



I was startled but kept my composure and replied:



""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""



""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.



""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""



""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.



""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""



""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""



""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""



""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.



Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:



""Was he calm?""



I looked at her and couldn't help myself:



""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""



She burst out laughing and then said:



""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""



I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!",1,1748677368.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1kzrihe,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1kzrihe/i_asked_the_same_girl_out_twice_without_realizing/,I asked the same girl out twice without realizing it and now I feel ashamed.,"
My (20M) biggest phobia, and one that fuels my anxiety is constant overthinking about whether or not I make women uncomfortable. My biggest fear has always been being a Pig/creep/weirdo to women and that thought has always held me back from pursuing relationships. Im also autistic and have difficulty understanding body language and social cues. I’m also pretty self aware, and I know that as long as I’m respectful, polite and NOT pushy and know to take no for answer, that I will be fine and im not committing some social sin by showing interest in someone and asking them out, which is a thought that’s took me a very long time to internalize as I’ve struggled with very low self esteem/ self-worth issues (honestly I still do sometimes but I’m trying to get better) 

One of the rules I have to myself is that if I like someone enough to work up the nerve to ask them out, (which is rare) I only do it once, and move on, I never ask again after that. I think this rule is good to have because after she already says no once, any attempt to date after that is pursuing, and that falls into creep territory which I precisely try my hardest to avoid. 

I’ve recently built up courage to ask a coworker out (18F) the thing is, we barely talked before that. We’d say hello to each other when we crossed paths and we’d have a few very brief interactions here and there, but for the most part, we barely spoken before I asked her out. She only works 2 days of the week I work (she’s part time, I’m full) So In the moment leading up to it, I definitely remember feeling a sense of “Okay, fuck it, do it now while you feel confident” and walked up to her and said exactly: 
 
“Hey, I know you barely know me but I was wondering if you’d like to maybe get some dinner some time?” 

She stood there frozen for a second, looking confused, before saying she’ll think about it. Without even thinking I hastily replied with:

 “no worries, you don’t have to give me an answer now, just think about it and let me know, okay? 

To be honest, in the moment when she said she’ll think about it, I seriously thought she meant that she was gonna think about my proposition and come back to me with either a yes or a no. only hours later I realized; “ohhhhh, that was a rejection! she just didn’t want to hurt my feelings!”
I also realized I didn’t even ask for her number, or leave her mine because my anxiety was through the roof in and I didn’t even fully realize what I was saying/ how weird I was acting. I was more focused on getting the words out without being off putting. I’m a chronic overthinker, so for some reason my dumb brain placed emphasis on the part specifically about going to “dinner” and came to the dumb conclusion that; “okay, it was weird for me to ask her out to dinner, that’s WAY TOO straightforward… I’ll apologize for being weird and offer to grab just a quick coffee instead!” (Which is also the wrong conclusion but, my brain thinks slow about this type of stuff and realized that too late)

Fast forward a week later, which is the next time I see her. She came into work, we exchanged hellos as if nothing happened. Later in the day I approached her and say exactly this; (I practiced it in my head days before hand lol) 

“Hey, remember when I asked you out dinner? I’m really sorry about that, that was much too forward of me. I’d still like to get to know you better for sure but maybe not over dinner, just over a simple coffee or lunch instead? 

Her reply was; “I’m busy with things, I don’t have time to go out with you, sorry” 

I immediately sensed that I was being a nuisance to her so my mind backpedaled into overly formal mode which is something I tend to do frequently, and replied with; “that’s completely okay, thank you so much for being nice about it, and im so sorry for bothering you in the first place. I hope I didn’t creep you out or anything, I know we have to work together so I’m sorry for making coming to work weird for you if I did. I hope we can still be friends or acquaintances at least but that’s up to you of course” 

Again, only hours later after thinking about it more I realized; “holy shit, I broke my rule! I asked her out twice! The first time to dinner, the second to coffee!” This also sorta explains to me why she was much more serious sounding the second time around, as to say “if ya didn’t get the message I’ll say it louder and clearer dumbass!” which is actually exactly what happened now I say it haha. It’s been a few days since this happened and I know I should just accept it as one of many social hiccups I’ve had because I didn’t realize fully what I’d done till after but I still feel a slight sense of guilt/shame come over me whenever she comes into work. The Thing is I’m self aware that it’s all in my head. She most likely doesn’t think I’m some weirdo creep when she sees me, and she’s most likely forgotten all about it anyway, and I should too, but my mind won’t let this go for some reason. 

I don’t know what I should tell myself to make these thoughts disappear because I know I’m only doing it to myself, I’m sure I did nothing wrong but for some reason the more I think about it the more I feel like I was creeping her out which shames me and makes me never want to attempt anything like that again in fear that I scare someone. It’s kind of hard to say this without sounding at least a little pathetic, but I always thought it’d be nice to have a girlfriend, and Id like to get one if I managed to somehow earn one, but it’s the stuff like this, my low self esteem, and the overthinking in my head about what to say and the right way to act make it so hard for me to do so, it’s already bad enough for me as someone who struggles with understanding social cues and unwritten rules in conversations. 

Sorry this is a more of a vent post then anything but please I don’t really have any friends to talk with this about so any thoughts that anyone may have, please feel free to share (brutal honestly is appreciated as well, no holds barred!) thank you. ",1,1748677326.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False
1kzrh6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1kzrh6p/3_months_in/,3 Months In,"May 25, 2025

These are my thoughts, feelings and 💛 alone.  

3 months of “widow”hood.

Now that’s a word I’ve not used or accepted yet.  

“Passed away” or “lost him….” is easier than the more common word.  

Unconventional as it may be, I feel this passage is almost like a term paper assignment.  We completed it from “I do” to “til death…..”.  We may not have written the perfect paper, but we did the best we knew how and now the grade we get is up to the teacher.  

Many people say that in the end, they gave their permission to let go, it’s ok, you can go.  I feel like for the last 4, 5, 6 months, he was gently, quietly letting me go.  As he always did, he made every aspect of my life easy.  He took care of himself as long as possible; he encouraged me to keep going out, meeting friends for coffee or lunch dates, even run errands. He never once asked me to not leave him.  He’d been letting me go with grace and dignity.  He knew I’d be fine and he was telling me he’d be fine. It was quiet and easy. 
There are so very many things I thought would be harder.  

I often thought I’d begrudge all my friends who still had their spouses, but I find I’m not at all.  I’m happy to hear about their lives, adventures.  In a way, I’m sort of feeling like the (unwilling) trailblazer who can show them one way, my way, to handle losing their best friend.

I thought I’d not be able to talk about him, look at pictures, listen to his favorite songs, see his favorite books on his nightstand; his glasses.  But, as of today, I can. His picture is my screensaver, and it makes me smile. 

I say “as of today”, because, while I don’t dwell on it, I’m sort of interested  to see if I hit a grief wall.  Oh, I’m sad, I cry more than you might think.  It’s not easy, it’s hard.  But I feel like I still see him broken and unfixable at the end.  I am remembering that man and not YET focusing on the other 59 years man. The guy in all the pictures.  Once the fresh picture in my head has faded, maybe I’ll better grieve what I’ve lost. 

I didn’t know if I’d feel guilty laughing, have a adventuresome life without him.    But I know he’s both laughing and rolling his eyes at my joy.  Being a constant poster, I was out there immediately. It didn’t mean I wasn’t heartbroken.  Writing, posting, is my way of coping.  I hope no one thought “well, she got over that pretty damn fast!”  

I choose to think God in his wisdom, gave us all the crap stuff to help buffer the real chore of grieving in the beginning.  The paperwork (which, while time consuming, has gone fairly smoothly), the celebration honoring him, the thank you notes (in the mail), are distractions. 

I know many of you have lost your best friend, your companion and have made your own peace privately.  But, as you all know, I’m pretty much an open book and must write and you must read.  It is my salvation and if any one sentence, one word helps anyone, I’m happy.  

But mainly, foremost, and most importantly, it’s the carefully cultivated, nourished, village surrounding my family and me.  The flowers have died, the cards in the mail have stopped, and people are going back to their normal lives, while being most respectful of our new “norm”.  I don’t want anyone to be sad for me, and I don’t to be sad for anyone being sad for me.  

I understand it’s a lifetime process getting here and continuing, and each day is either easy or hard.  I never know. But my family and I have the best tribe who always knows when it’s time to circle the wagons.

I would be honored to be part of your tribe when it’s time.",2,1748677176.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

as you all know the ""frosting effect"" when applying matt varnish via spray can is our worst nightmare and even with being experienced and careful, somehow it happens from time to time...

So yesterday I varnished some models and despite being careful and having varnished some models before, it happened to me too...

Frustrated from the result, I decided to think about it next morning how to solve it, as it had to dry anyways before taking any further actions...

So I just sat down with a coffee at my model desk and started playing around a little bit...

I have to admit that the frosting was not super strong... anyways after some back and forth I was able to get rid of the frosting by kinda sweeping it off with a slightly moist drybrush and went fully away...

I wasn't able to take any pictures before and after, but I wanted to share it with you anyways as I know how Frustrating it is, when you Ruin your paint job you spent hours of painting on within seconds...

I don't know if this method also works with ""heavy frosting"", so feel free to share your experiences...

1kzr81k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1kzr81k/how_to_date_in_your_30s/,How to date in your 30’s?,"Long story short I was in a long term relationship for 11-12 years (considered him to be both my partner and best friend). However, he ended things and walked away about 2 years + ago. I’ve focused on myself during that time trying to improve and heal, always had hope maybe he would come back but when I found out my ex was seeing someone new I decided it’s time for me to try and date again.

I’ve not had any luck, as I don’t have a social circle, just really go to work, come home and sometimes the gym. I literally don’t know anyone I would be interested in or who is interested in me. So for the first time in my life I tried the dreaded online dating. I hate it and really don’t think it’s for me. I tried Bumble for a month, matches come and go but conversation didn’t last long before they unmatched me. The same with Hinge, but I managed to talk to someone for two days before they unmatched me. Last and longest I tried for maybe 3 months was Tinder, only reason I stayed that long as I managed to get a bit more communication and asked out for a coffee or a walk. Met 3 men, first one I spent a lot of time on 2 dates with but he got too touchy and feely on the second date so I got overwhelmed and uncomfortable told him later via text and just let that die off after about a week of messaging. The second guy was hard to read (never asked for my number) and seemed quite low effort and only suggested going for walks, I was disappointed and tired after meeting the second time and when he asked if I wanted to go to and escape room with him I don’t think I even answered him and just asked had he gone before (didn’t message again after that and I think I unmatched after two weeks). The third and last guy I decided to meet for a coffee/ walk around the park. He never asked for my number and either of us messaged each other on the app afterwards, so I unmatched after a week. That’s when I finally deleted my account and realised online dating isn’t for me and I would rather meet someone naturally and who is actually interested in me for me.

What I have learnt about online dating:
- appears to be a lot of fake account or scammers? I’m having similar conversations and they are asking for my number to move away from the app (I refuse to give my number to someone I haven’t met in person).
- men just really aren’t interested, they either don’t message and those that do disappear after a day or so.
- online dating creates people who are still looking for something better to come along or who are dating multiple people.
- men don’t always read profiles, or ask you a stupid question like what are you looking for when your profile really states long term relationship.

For those that have been successful in finding a long term partner in their 30’s, how did you?

I’ve accepted the fact that I lost someone who I thought was my person and someone I would have spent the rest of my life with, and that on my experience so far I am unlikely to find someone new. I’ve never been engaged, never been married and never had kids. I’ll be 34 years old in the next month so feeling like I’ve missed out or will miss out on these things in life if I don’t ever find a new partner.

I want to tell you what I never said.
The day we met, from the instant I saw your magnificent eyes, my heart fell for you.
In that moment, the world stopped for a minute. I just couldn’t speak normally or think about anything.
Thankfully, my workmate was there to offer you coffee that morning! Because I was really stunned.
Your eyes… green and brown… your black hair… your height (almost as tall as me!)… your smile when you said hi to me… it made me feel something I hadn’t felt for more than 10 years.

I’ve got a crush on you. And working with you and getting to know you has transformed that crush into real feelings.

You are so smart. So funny… I can’t believe how lucky I am to know you. The complicity we have built month after month, I just can’t get rid of it. I love all our little moments.

Your sensibility when I’ve had little downs touched me so much… it was so pure from you… even though we didn’t know each other that well, you were there in your own way. It was so nice of you.

I care for you. And I know you are always in movement, always doing things. But I want you to take care of yourself and let yourself rest a bit. Please, listen to me. Sometimes you are so tired… I just want you to feel okay. Seeing you going down in January and February just saddened me so much.

Seeing you now, full of life again, makes me so happy. Seeing you happy with your friends in the picture you shared the other day just warmed my heart. If you’re fine, if you’re happy, then I feel so good. Even if I’m not there with you.

I know we’ve been turning around each other for some time now… but I know we will find the way. It’s just a matter of time. The distance between us, and the fact that we work together, slows everything down… but we will overcome this!

I love your jokes, your spontaneity, how you just feel comfortable with me… I love working with you even if I don’t love work!

I just love your smile, and seeing you laughing with me on Tuesday just made my heart melt one more time. Your smile is like a drug for me. I always want more of it. That’s why I’m always trying to make you laugh! It’s the best feeling in the world.

I just think you are the woman I wanted to meet for all these years. I really want it to work with you. I want to overcome my insecurities and be the man I want to be for me and for you.

I don’t want you to change everything for me. The way you always do things with friends or even alone is what makes you who you are. It’s so important to me that you feel as free as you are today. That’s what makes you special! Unlike me, you do things no matter your situation. You don’t wait. You act! And that energy is so great.

I just can’t believe you’ve not met anyone yet, with all the things you do…

To you, my friend. I admire you so much.

I wish I could tell you all this one day.

Please share your own lists to compare.,"I have a google doc comprising every bad thing she ever did to me which I read semi-regularly to remind myself why I shouldn't contact her.

The document is 4 pages long.

Here is most of that document:

* Told a mutual friend about one of my deepest secrets, which I've only told about 5 people in my entire life.
* Poured her drink all over me and the interior of my new car while I was driving and then shattered a glass in the car as she got out.
* Said she felt like throwing hot coffee on me while visibly shaking with anger
* Flipped my coffee table.
* Would repeatedly yell at me to break up with her over and over and then get more upset when I broke up with her.
* Called me a pussy, little bitch, idiot; said “fuck you” more times than I can count.
* Wrongfully abused and overused the words “gaslighting” and “invalidating” to describe my actions.
* Gaslit and invalidated me countless times.
* Said she ""doesn't know what to do"" when I was sad or crying or looking for support/reassurance.
* Smiled sadistically while commenting on my previous ex breaking up with me.
* The night before our final fight I felt like a hostage while she cuddled me in bed.
* Produced a blood-curdling wail after I broke up with her for the last time. Got in my face. Used her whole body weight to slam through locked doors when I was trying to get away from her. Stood at the other side of my locked bedroom door and threatened “You’ve made a terrible mistake” while making other threats as I stayed silent. Paced loudly back and forth through the house, slamming doors repeatedly as I lied there in a full-on panic. Made me feel genuinely terrified of my partner for the first time in my life. The next day, she threw herself down the stairs after I refused to get back together with her. This was easily the worst 48 hours I've spent in a relationship in my entire life.
* Reminded me of an abusive boyfriend in a movie we were watching and then became defensive and angry at me when I told her this (she asked because she sensed something was wrong, I wouldn't have brought it up otherwise).
* Would become upset if she saw me online without immediately responding to her message. Became such an issue that I blocked her on instagram which only worsened her worries. One of the last nights we hung out together, she initiated a fight based on the idea that I was texting other women because I was in the bathroom for too long.
* Was worried I was seeing other women because I had broken capillaries.
* Would almost never post to her instagram story but ALWAYS posted if we were fighting. Always stuff that was designed to get my attention or garner sympathy from others.
* After I finally stopped hanging out with her, she bragged to me that she received head one night and then proceeded to become extremely rude and hostile saying she KNOWS I’ve been seeing “some bitch” multiple times (which is not true, I’d seen no one.)
* At least a couple times became upset at me because I wasn't in the mood to have sex.
* Was obsessed with comparing herself to my previous girlfriend whom she has never met.
* Actively escalated fights if I ignored her. Made me feel guilty for taking time and space to think and process. Would say ""You know I'm only going to get angrier if you don't respond.""
* During the first big incident between us that caused recurring fights that lasted our whole relationship, she initially told me the explanation of why she got upset was for one particular reason. Then, when she brought it up weeks later, the reason for why she initially became upset had changed. Months after THAT, the reason had yet again changed.
* Several times I tried to tell her about what was going on in my life--which she specifically requested because I ""wasn't telling her enough about myself""--it just made her more upset.
* I spent countless days attempting to communicate and reassure her over text but it was almost never enough.
* Interrupted me constantly during arguments after she demanded I respond.
* Berated me with sarcasm and contradictory language more times than I can count.
* Sometimes was just in a terrible mood by default and took it out on me.
* Given the option between 1. being utterly miserable and fighting with me for hours at a time OR 2. just calling it a day and not hanging out, she always preferred the former.
* Demanded arguments/fights continue in person until she burns out or gets what she wants.
* Would send me dozens of messages overnight while I was sleeping, usually crossing from anger into sadness into guilt into infatuation.
* Asked “do you want me to hurt myself?” in response to my reactions during fights.
* Brutally hurt herself in front of me several times to the point where I had to grab her arms and yell at the top of my voice “Fucking stop it!” in order to get her to stop hurting herself.
* Felt the need to get even and escalate if I did something she deemed wrong.
* If I responded to her verbal and emotional abuse by defending myself and treating her the way she was treating me, even briefly, she would give my wrongdoing exponentially more attention while barely acknowledging or never acknowledging that she was the one who started it.
* Actively warned me she was going to start talking to someone else in my place if I couldn’t give her enough attention.
* Became defensive and angry when called out for bad behavior and would consistently DARVO.
* Became defensive and angry and manipulative when I told her I was exhausted from fighting and didn’t feel like talking.
* Mentally committed words and actions to me that did not apply or exist and attached herself to false narratives she constructed in her mind.
* Seemed to find me annoying and unattractive quite frequently in the earlier part of our relationship. Once I changed and became more masculine for her she liked me more.
* Loved reading those ""get to know your partner"" card game questions so that I could answer questions about what I thought of her. But when it was her turn to answer questions about what she thought of me, she would struggle to find any answer and was more likely to give short responses or say ""I don't know"".
* Became upset at me if I didn’t relay my work schedule. Became upset if my schedule in general changed without me informing her the moment something came up. But I couldn’t tell her about schedule changes overnight while she was sleeping because that would upset her. I also apparently had “poor tact” in terms of timing when I told her that my schedule changed and that also upset her. She trained me to become nervous when I was about to tell her about my upcoming schedule.
* Told me she was in love with someone else for the first few months of our relationship despite at the time telling me she had no interest in dating him. Later retracted that saying she lied about that to hurt me on purpose. Not sure which is worse (or even truth).
* Shamed me into performing oral by comparing me to other men who would be happy to do that for her.
* Made me cry by yelling at me so intensely because I accidentally took one bite of her food that I thought was mine.
* Yelled at me when I accidentally got 1 single drop of ice water in her drink when I was holding my beverage above hers.
* Seemed to kinda want me to be more jealous.
* Once said something to the effect of “Being in conflict with someone makes the sex better.”
* Was micro-managing my own social media (instagram likes, instagram activity, spotify history, messenger activity) making me feel anxious and oppressed.
* Would tell me to “go find someone who will love you less” during episodes.
* Snapped at me once when I woke her up calmly and sweetly trying to get her to come to bed.
* On several occasions where I just wanted to hang out separately in my apartment or play video games while she was already asleep, she would wake up very angry and initiate a brutal fight.
* Waiting for her to come to bed made me feel anxious a lot of the time because I didn't feel like I had permission to fall asleep until she wanted to fall asleep.
* Regularly became upset if I did basically anything without her such as: getting groceries or planning a hang-out with a friend I never see or watching a movie that I mentioned in passing that she wasn’t even interested in seeing.",1,1748674742.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

There are plenty of leftover partial boxes of screws and such I bought and didn’t use them all. I have a few old school little drawers of various fasteners and such that are vaguely organized, but mostly they’re just all tossed in fishing tackle boxes that I’ve been meaning to sort and order for… I dunno…. Probably decades. Due to an unusual story, I met my biological father when I was 35. He also had a lot of screws and such. Somehow, I guess this sort of thing is hereditary and he passed on the gift of removing and saving fasteners from a thing before throwing it out. 

I didn’t get to inherit his screws and such when he died. I only got to know him for about 10 years and that was not nearly enough. I guess my kids won’t want all my screws and such but I hope they might keep a few… you know… in case they need a certain, hard to find bolt or washer for something.

1kzqqnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ExaminationMiddle235/comments/1kzqqnk/continuing_from_my_first_post_my_first_dumbass/,Continuing from my first post: my first dumbass boyfriend,"As a kid I wasn't allowed to date, and even when I started high-school the rules stood. Despite my parents warnings, I developed a crush on a cute guy in my friends math class. At 16, I was a nerdy type of girl, and he was a football player. Way out of my league or so I thought at the time. When his name popped up on Snapchat, I was ecstatic! I added him and we starred talking. He never officially asked me out but we agreed we were dating. 

He would remember the small details, the kind of chocolate and coffee i liked, and brought them to school in the mornings to give to me. Eventually my parents found out and made me break up with him. I told him I couldn't see him anymore but we could meet in private, away from prying eyes around the halls. This went on for a while, he even gave me an iPod with an apple ID so we could text, as I was not allowed to have a phone. 

My parents found out and made me break up with him. This time my dad was pissed. His belt left bruises on my butt. I was willing to try again, so we became even more secret. I ended up getting a job and bought my first phone. We texted all the time, every spare second I had, I spent it texting him or waiting for him to text back. We kept it hidden for months, until my mom found out. We had guests over so I knew they wouldn't do anything that second. I went to the pastors house, mind you it was around 10pm at the time. I told him everything, being the religious people I was raised to be, I confessed everything and broke up with bf for real this time. 

It hurt the both of us a lot, I was then taken home and was greeted by my fuming father. The night passed in a blur. I remember him asking me questions about what did I think I was doing, he continued to yell questions at me as I sat on the couch. When he wasn't satisfied with my answers he pulled me up by my hair and I stood up. He asked me another question, can't remember what it was, but my answer was unsatisfactory. He slapped me across the face so hard I fell backwards into the couch. I dont remember my cheek stinging. I felt numb, yet the tears of emotional pain welled up and fell hot across my cheeks. He then told me to go to bed. 

I went to my room I shared with my sisters, and silently cried. The pastor talked to my dad for a while and I tensed up when I heard footsteps coming closer to the door. The door handle turned and my father stepped inside, the bed dipping where he sat. He gently pulled me up and gave me a hug, apologizing for what he had done, while justifying it at the same time. He asked if I forgave him, which I said yes to. 

At this point my heart felt like a stone. I despised him in the moment. I decided to go back to my bf. So I did. And once again I got caught. This time I was given an ultimatum. ""It's either him or us. If you choose him, there's the door, we won't come after you""  

I ended up falling into a restless sleep, and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning. I had made up my mind. Before I could lose my nerve, I packed what little items that were mine so that I didn't feel that I owed them anything. Went upstairs, put on my shoes and slowly opened their bedroom door. They sat up and I blurted ""I'm leaving."" My dad asked ""what?"" At the same time that I repat that I'm leaving my mom also says ""she says she's leaving"" i close the bedroom door, and rush out the front, as soon as the front door is closed I bolt. I know exactly where I'm going and which roads to take.  (Will post part 2, technically part 3)",1,1748674218.0,u_ExaminationMiddle235,0,1.0,False
1kzqqlf,https://i.redd.it/sq5yukw6e24f1.jpeg,My Fragrance Collection – Quick Reviews + Ratings,"Hey r/desifragranceaddicts Here’s a quick rundown of my current rotation—a mix of designer, fresh, sweet, and Middle Eastern scents. I’ve included scent profiles, personal ratings, and longevity estimates.

You’ll notice some traditionally “feminine” fragrances here. That’s intentional—I don’t believe fragrance should be gendered. To me, scent is unisex and should be worn by whoever enjoys it.

🧴 Left to Right (as in the photo):

1. Armaf Odyssey Mandarin Sky
🔹 Scent: Citrus, fruity, aquatic
🔹 Rating: 3/10
🔹 Longevity: ~1 hour
2. Chanel Gabrielle
🔹 Scent: White florals, citrus, ylang-ylang
🔹 Rating: 8/10
🔹 Longevity: 8+ hours
3. Lacolm Miracle
🔹 Scent: Fresh floral, pepper, lychee
🔹 Rating: 8/10
🔹 Longevity: 8+ hours
4. Rasasi Hawas
🔹 Scent: Aquatic, fruity, musky
🔹 Rating: 4/10
🔹 Longevity: ~2 hours
5. Lacolm La Vie Est Belle
🔹 Scent: Sweet, vanilla, praline, powdery
🔹 Rating: 8.5/10
🔹 Longevity: 8+ hours
6. Dior Sauvage (EDT)
🔹 Scent: Bergamot, pepper, ambroxan
🔹 Rating: 5/10
🔹 Longevity: ~3 hours
7. Dior Spice Blend
🔹 Scent: Warm spices, rum, resin
🔹 Rating: 5/10
🔹 Longevity: ~6 hours
8. Lacoste Challenge
🔹 Scent: Lemon, ginger, woody
🔹 Rating: 6/10
🔹 Longevity: ~3 hours
9. Lattafa Qahwa
🔹 Scent: Coffee, spices, smoky woods
🔹 Rating: 6/10
🔹 Longevity: ~3 hours

Layering & Usage:
I often use Lacolm Miracle or La Vie Est Belle as a base layer, then finish with one of the others for a more complex and lasting scent. I love how these layered combinations turn out.

Everyday wear: La Vie Est Belle + Lattafa Qahwa
Special occasions: Lacolm Miracle + any of the above, depending on the mood

Do any of you also enjoy floral and feminine fragrances, or is it just me?

He cut off all contact with me  a year ago, got engaged shortly afterwards and he's getting married this summer from what I understand. The person he chose is much younger and more attractive than me. 

I've been absolutely in hell for the past two years. I haven't thought of dating or being with anyone. Twice I signed up to a dating app but didn't like anyone, chatted to a couple of people who messaged me but mostly just ended up talking about him. Didn't want to meet or go on any dates and ended up deleting the app both times. 

I still miss him. Think about him everyday and his upcoming wedding. Wake up in pain wishing I could hear his voice. 

I downloaded the app again again recently and got a few messages including one from a man who wants to meet me tommorrow. I haven't spoken to him much just a few messages. He's alright I suppose just .. meh. Just a man like I'd see in the street. Feel no real interest or attraction (but I dont feel that for anyone).

I said yeah I'd meet because I thought a coffee is OK and I don't have to stay long. 

But now I just feel sad and don't want to. I'd rather just stay in bed or read or go for a walk or do the laundry or whatever. 

Should I force myself to go? I just feel sad and uncomfortable. And kind of dread.

 Living on campus.

Had some classes done in highschool.
Clubs met infrequently.. intramural sports were non-existent besides weekly pingpong.

Smaller 4 year university. Cliquey social atmosphere.
Couldn't break in. 
Random Roommate didn't want anything to do with me..
Sat alone for 2 years.. 
Terrible part time professors.. I was teaching myself with YouTube..
Haven't learned anything.

Computer classes that abruptly throw half the class off a cliff in complexity..

Unspecified requirements in program. That aligned to Lazy autograding program used to judge our assignments..


Teacher didn't  care.
Advisor told me to leave the program. Because I was a bit sad and unhappy with the coursework and professor.

I tried my best
I failed. I don't know what I'm going to do now.. go back to different school? Hopefully get some aid? 

My Mom was a major driving force in getting me to go to college. I felt like I was pressured and forced when I wasn't ready.. 


If I can't meet my people in college, will I ever? 


I wouldn't even know what to choose.

Lazy online modules. Endless soulless discussion boards..

Took my money and drive. 

- random roommate didn't want anything to do with me and barely talked.

- 2 years pretty much completely isolated despite really trying my best to get involved.

-Still a fat ugly loser even though I lost 40 pounds fixing my diet and moving more.

- learning literally nothing in business minor class for 8 weeks. Fed up trying to get involved.

- go to videogame  playing Mario Kart on Switch (I've never had one so I suck) with strangers, in between a freshman trying to rizz up one of the two girls there.
Meanwhile I accidentally taking screenshots trying to drive my kart


Stay in ""Mom's basement"" and do online class?..

I don't have the merit scholarship I had before..?
What kind of help is available for people who want to transfer colleges? I basically took a gap year and and looking to go somewhere else.. 

Should I just do it online?


I wouldn't even know what to choose.

I have about half my degree done.. was in ""business information system"".. 

started out in cyber security... 
I don't know if that's for me. Wasn't super interested and I don't have a network to get a job in this now saturated field.. 

 I had a plan and and I really tried but still failed.

*********

Currently:

I'm making $13 retail. Midwest. 1 year working ..
I feel like a robot just stacking shelves.

One good thing is I don't have a manager or boss breathing down my neck all the time.. but I feel direction less sometimes and there's nothing to do. 
I barely ever see my new Team Leader.. have to schedule off a week and some in advance. random schedule and feels like my life revolves around it.
Made in advance every Thursday for the week ahead. I can't even schedule anything..

Barely talk to anyone. Coworkers. People in other departments.. 

A lot of the time I feel like I have nothing to say. Nothing to add. Nothing in common. 

Or I'm not really interested. 

Do a lot of people just keep asking questions? Feign interest?

I can barely process what they're saying sometimes.. 

How to go deeper? 

How to build familiarly when your an anxious and depressed homebody in other places? Volunteer? Coffee shops? Clubs? Bars? I don't have the energy (or money.)


I've been clocking into my retail stocking job in grocery store produce dept. and it's all just basic pleasantries. I try to start something, joke around with the older folk the handful of times I'm invited to the conversation. 


I've literally got nothing to talk about; make comments on the state of the department.

Maybe I should have been more bubbly when I started. I was just struggling to learn the job and everyone's name.


It's been almost 10 months. 

Gained back a lot of the weight I lost with the help of ADHD meds.

Negative self talk. Anxious. 


Things are awkward. I know nothing about 2  new hires around my age in my department. Its been like two months+. Should I just be like:


""Hey, tell me about yourself?"" Randomly out of the blue? 

When we've all just been focusing on work.?

Even then they barely respond to me. I've stopped trying. I can barely even coordinate with them and it is almost like they avoid being in the backroom with me. Its awkward..


It's a little better with older people I seems. But I still struggle..

Older 40 something lady:

""Hey do you have any kids?""

""Nice hair, do they call that a bob right?""

(I know nothing about women.)

It's been so long wouldn't it be strange?


I tried to reconnect with an old friend in an even worse place


Always making excuses for myself.. and my mental health hasn't been best.

I knew I had to be more social in college.. I took advantage of everything I could. Still sat alone in cafeteria 89% of the time. Tried to get into a few frats. Even though paying for friends doesn't seem right. One guy just met me and pretends like he knows me all my life immediately. Gets me to follow on instagram and we never talk again.

Played Jackbox with strangers a few times.. Shot hoops for the first time in 6 years. Couldn't make a single shot.. 
No one was interested, I could barely banter around with them. It was like they already knew who they were  going to choose.

I tried man. I really tried. I feel like a social lombotomite after awhile man.",3,1748674021.0,findapath,3,1.0,False
1kzqo1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1kzqo1r/a_premonition_dream/,A premonition dream?,"A few years ago, I worked with this woman who ended up conveniently living next to me a year later. We had small conversations here and there and then one week, I didn’t see her sitting in her porch as much. She was a frequent smoker. 

One night, I had a dream that she had tried to commit suicide. I have never had a dream like this before. I still have never had one since. When I woke, I found it quite strange and unsettling and pondered on it for a while. During the second week, not only did I see her less, but she stopped showing up to work. I ended up going to knock on her door to check on her, but got no answer. I began to worry but I figured she was probably out of town.

The very next morning, I awoke to the police carrying her out in a stretcher. I felt a surge of sadness and fear and confusion as to what had happened and as to how long she had gone unnoticed inside of her home. I felt so angry with myself in that moment that I didn’t push harder to make sure she was alright or make more of an effort.

Unfortunately, she had tried to commit suicide. Thankfully, she survived her attempt. After that, I had made sure to always be out every morning with a coffee and a cigarette so we could have our morning conversations. I made sure she knew she wasn’t alone and if she needed anyone, I was right across from her. 

Later, I found out that our beds literally were on opposite sides of the wall. Our bedrooms were only separated by a wall. It’s as if I was hearing her thoughts somehow. She’s doing better last I heard. I’ve moved since.

Just thought I’d share. If you’re feeling alone, please know you aren’t. The world needs you here. Please take care of yourselves. ",3,1748673933.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

There was a scene of them in a cabin hiding out and I think a shootout takes place. The scene i remember is 2 American soldiers sitting by a fire or something, camped out and one guy had hot coffee and offered some to the other guy and he said no I don't like coffee and drank hot lemonade instead. I would say the movie was probably made anywhere from like
 2005-15. . Can't remember many other details. I don't believe there was any big A list actors or directors or anything but it didn't seem like a super low budget movie. I just remembered snow and maybe a bunch of nazis surrendered in the beginning but not certain it was this movie, some details I feel like I'm mixing up with other movies or shows. I specifically remember the hot lemonade scene tho cuz I don't like coffee either so I could relate to still wanting something to warm you up. It was also on Netflix for awhile but definitely 10+ years ago as I haven't been on Netflix in at least that llong.

1kzqk20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kzqk20/the_broken_heiress_way_to_vengeance_novel_she_was/,"""The Broken Heiress' Way to Vengeance Novel""- She Was Finally Free","The cold iron gates of the prison in Hoverdale creaked open.    
  
Sunlight fell on Lauren Bennett's gaunt, sallow face.    
  
The clothes she had worn when she was incarcerated now hung loosely on her frail frame.    
  
She had endured five dark, endless years in prison. Today, she was finally free.  
  
Dragging her legs, Lauren hobbled out of the prison, step by slow step.    
  
She moved sluggishly, not because she didn't want to walk faster, but because she simply couldn't.    
  
A black Bentley was parked by the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a man's deep-set, brooding face.    
  
His gaze swept over her injured leg. He let out a cold scoff, the mockery in his eyes blatant. ""After five years in prison, you're still putting on an act.""    
  
Lauren's heart clenched unexpectedly, and a sour sting rose in her eyes.    
  
Elliot Bennett was her biological brother.    
  
Ever since she had been brought back to the Bennett family from the orphanage at fifteen, she had done everything she could to please him.    
  
Yet for the sake of an adopted sister who wasn't even related to him by blood, he had personally falsified evidence to convict her of attempted murder.    
  
Five years had passed, and he was still as sharp-tongued and as disgusted with her as ever.    
  
Lauren swallowed the bitterness, pretending not to see Elliot as she limped forward.    
  
Elliot's face stiffened.    
  
She had ignored him.    
  
In his memory, Lauren had always clung to him, eager to please.    
  
When he came home, she would bring him his slippers.    
  
When he was tired, she would massage his shoulders.    
  
When he had trouble sleeping, she would bring him chamomile tea every night.    
  
When work kept him too busy to come home for dinner, she would wait outside his office with a thermos, undeterred by rain or shine.  
  
During the three years she had been in their home, his chronic stomach issues had eased. But ever since she went to prison, he had often woken up in the middle of the night from the pain.    
  
Today, he had actually felt a hint of joy when he heard she was being released. He had even postponed an international meeting to pick her up.    
  
He had expected her to be overjoyed at seeing him, had even prepared himself for her to break down and complain about the suffering she had endured.    
  
He had never imagined she would greet him with nothing but silence and indifference.    
  
The admiration in her eyes was long gone. All that remained was distance.    
  
A strange, hollow feeling rose in his chest, irritating him. His grip on the steering wheel tightened, veins bulging on the back of his hand.    
  
His voice came out harsher than he intended. ""Get in the car.""    
  
The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them. With a frown, he forced himself to soften his tone. ""Dad and Mom know you're out today. They've prepared a welcome-home dinner for you.""    
  
*Dad and Mom. Such familiar yet foreign words.*    
  
In the orphanage, she had dreamed of having parents who would love her, who would spoil her like a princess.    
  
She had waited and longed for it for fifteen years.    
  
Fifteen years later, her wish had finally come true.    
  
She had parents now, even a tall, handsome, and capable brother.  
  
But the beloved daughter of the family wasn't her. It was the adopted daughter they had raised since childhood, Willow Bennett.    
  
Those people weren't her parents. They were Elliot and Willow's parents.    
  
Lauren scoffed at herself.    
  
During those three years in that family, she had endured endless cold shoulders and humiliation. She had always known she was unwanted. There was no reason to go back and subject herself to it again.   
  
Though she walked slowly, she never stopped.    
  
Her indifference, her stubborn retreat, stung Elliot's eyes and ignited a nameless fury in his chest.    
  
He pushed open the car door and strode after her, his long legs easily closing the distance. He grabbed her wrist and yanked her back. ""Have you had enough of this act?""    
  
Thrown off balance, Lauren crashed to the ground. Pain shot through her injured leg, her face turning deathly pale.    
  
Elliot's anger flared. ""Still playing weak? Is this your new trick?""    
  
""Don't forget, you were the one who pushed Elaine down the stairs five years ago and left her in a coma. You even tried to frame Willow for it. Five years in prison, and you still haven't learned your lesson? Looks like it wasn't enough to reform you.""  
  
With that, he grabbed her and hauled her up without an ounce of care. His voice was laced with disgust. ""Don't think your sentence erases your sins. As long as Elaine remains unconscious, your crime will never be absolved. And you still owe Willow an apology. Get in the car. Don't make me say it again.""    
  
Lauren only found it laughable.    
  
She had explained before. Elaine Gray wasn't pushed by her. It was Willow.    
  
But no one had believed her. They had all chosen Willow's side.    
  
She was the biological daughter of the Bennett family, yet everyone had placed their trust in Willow's words instead.    
  
She was guilty, indeed. Guilty of ever returning. Guilty of ever hoping for a love that was never hers.    
  
She had learned her lesson. She would change.    
  
She would leave, far away, and never again fight for the affection of a family that didn't want her.    
  
*Why is Elliot so displeased?*    
  
She calmly pulled her hand from his grip and took a step back, putting distance between them.    
  
Her deliberate withdrawal made Elliot's chest tighten with frustration. His mind flashed with images of the old Lauren, the girl who had once followed him around, desperately trying to win his favor.    
  
Suppressing his anger, he tried to soften his voice. ""Come home with me.""    
  
Lauren lowered her eyes, her expression blank, as if she couldn't even be bothered to look at him.    
  
Her lifeless demeanor made Elliot's rage boil over.    
  
Five years in prison, and if she had learned anything, it was how to grow a temper.    
  
Just as he was about to snap, a warm, gentle voice interrupted.    
  
""Laurie.""    
  
Lauren's body tensed. Her heart, which had been numb for so long, clenched in an instant.    
  
Even after five years, she recognized that voice immediately.    
  
It was Lucas Reed, her childhood friend.    
  
She saw a pair of polished leather shoes enter her line of sight. A deep, magnetic voice spoke above her.    
  
""Laurie, congratulations on your freedom.""    
  
If anyone else had said that, she would have politely replied, ""Thank you.""    
  
But coming from Lucas, the words grated on her ears.    
  
Her most trusted childhood friend, Lucas, had taken on his first case after graduation as Willow's defense attorney, the one who had put her behind bars.    
  
Before the trial, he had said to her, ""Laurie, Willow has never suffered before. She wouldn't survive in prison. Can you take the blame for her?""    
  
*Willow couldn't suffer, but I could?*  
  
Just because she was used to hardship, she deserved to take the fall for a crime she didn't commit.  
  
Sending the real Bennett daughter to prison had made Lucas famous overnight in Hoverdale.    
  
Five years ago, he had still been a fresh graduate, a little green around the edges.    
  
Five years later, he had become one of the city's most renowned attorneys, exuding power and confidence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, closer than real siblings.    
  
When other kids bullied her, he had always defended her, swearing, ""As long as I'm here, no one will ever hurt you.""    
  
He had promised that when he became a lawyer, he would put anyone who hurt her behind bars.    
  
But later, when Willow had hurt her time and time again, he had dismissed her pain with a casual, ""Laurie, you're too sensitive. Willow isn't like that.""    
  
In the end, it was he, of all people, who had protected the one who hurt her and personally sent her to prison.    
  
...  
  
The air grew heavy with silence.    
  
Lucas' smile slowly stiffened, but he forced himself to extend a hand toward her. ""Laurie, I came to pick you up...""    
  
Before he could finish, Lauren suddenly turned to Elliot. ""You said we're going home, right? Let's go.""

**Chapter 2 Why Didn't They Come?**



Lauren knew she couldn't escape.    
  
Lucas had once been the person she trusted and relied on the most. Now, he was the one she loathed and least wanted to face.    
  
Rather than confronting Lucas, she chose the next best option—going with Elliot.  
  
At least, from beginning to end, Elliot had always despised her.    
  
The first day she went back to the Bennett Residence, Elliot had warned her, ""Even if we share the same blood, in my heart, I only have one sister, and that's Willow. You'd better behave yourself. If I ever catch you bullying Willow, I won't let you off.""    
  
He never gave her hope, so she never had too much disappointment. In front of Elliot, the psychological wounds she suffered could at least be minimized.    
  
It was better than being utterly destroyed by the one closest to her.    
  
Prison had taught her a lesson.    
  
When lacking power, status, or support, survival depended on minimizing harm by any means possible.  
  
So, when her cellmates toyed with her and made her choose between disfigurement and a slap, she chose the slap.    
  
When they made her choose between being beaten and kneeling, she chose to kneel.    
  
When they made her choose between drinking toilet water and barking like a dog, she chose to bark.    
  
She had fought back desperately before, but the more she resisted, the worse the beatings became. To stay alive, she threw away her dignity and let herself be used.    
  
Even when thrown among the most vicious criminals, she had still managed to survive, barely hanging on, by knowing when to avoid harm.    
  
Lauren walked toward Elliot's black Bentley.    
  
As she brushed past Lucas, her expression remained indifferent. She didn't even spare him a glance.    
  
The loose T-shirt skimmed past Lucas's fingertips. The emptiness of the touch didn't feel like fabric draping over a person. It was more like cloth hanging on a lifeless mannequin.    
  
Lucas' hand froze midair. In that instant, it felt like the air around him had solidified, leaving only that cold, hollow sensation at his fingertips.    
  
Pain and desolation flashed through his eyes, and his heart felt as if an invisible hand had clenched it tight, every beat throbbing with dull agony.    
  
Once, her gaze had always followed him, full of trust and dependence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, supporting each other. Whenever he called her name, she would always smile and answer, ""Luca, I'm here.""    
  
But now, time had changed everything.    
  
She looked right through him, as if he didn't exist, unwilling to even meet his eyes.    
  
Lucas' lips trembled slightly. He wanted to speak, but his throat felt blocked, unable to make a sound.    
  
Lauren got into the car and sat in the back seat. Everything in sight bore traces of another woman.    
  
The passenger seat had a fluffy pink cushion. The dashboard was lined with an entire row of adorable bear figurines. In the rearview mirror, the woman's reflection looked more mature than five years ago, more alluring.    
  
She was beaming, the kind of smile that only someone raised in comfort and luxury could have.    
  
That happiness on her face was like a silent taunt, mocking Lauren as the fake heiress.    
  
She had thought she could face all this indifferently. But seeing it with her own eyes still left a bitter sting in her chest.    
  
Lauren withdrew her gaze, but her eyes inadvertently landed on the handbag beside her.    
  
Inside was a pristine white gown. Even without seeing the whole dress, the intricate feather embellishments hinted at its elegance.    
  
Her fingers unconsciously rubbed against the rough denim of her jeans.    
  
Every detail inside the car reminded her that she didn't belong here.    
  
From head to toe, she wasn't even worth as much as the gown in that handbag.    
  
She turned to look out the window. The scenery blurred past in a rapid retreat.    
  
Elliot, still driving, didn't forget to warn her, ""Mom and Dad have missed you so much these past five years. They cried over you every day, their hair turning gray with worry. When you get home, keep your temper in check. I don't want to see you scheming against Willow again, making things difficult for them. As long as you behave, the Bennett family won't treat you unfairly.""    
  
Silence followed his words.    
  
Hearing no response, Elliot frowned in displeasure and glanced at her through the rearview mirror.    
  
""Lauren, I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?""    
  
Lauren finally looked up at him and spoke the longest sentence she had since leaving prison.    
  
""According to Article 48 of the Prison Law, inmates are allowed visits from family or guardians once a month, for thirty minutes to an hour. I was imprisoned for five years; that will be sixty months. If I had one visit per month, I could have seen them sixty times. But I never saw them once. You say your parents missed me. Then why didn't they come? Were they so busy that they couldn't spare even thirty minutes a month?""    
  
Her voice was calm, but every word was a blade, slicing through his lie without mercy.    
  
Guilt and panic flickered across Elliot's eyes. The reprimand he had prepared was caught in his throat, unable to come out.    
  
Avoiding her steady yet piercing gaze, his fingers instinctively tightened around the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white from the pressure.    
  
""It... It's because you were too hard to discipline. Mom and Dad didn't visit you because they wanted you to focus on correcting your bad behavior. They did it for your own good.""    
  
*For my own good? Letting me take the fall for Willow, making me suffer in prison... So, that's their idea for my own good. What a joke.*    
  
Lauren felt drained, utterly uninterested in arguing anymore. She turned her gaze back to the window.    
  
Before long, the car pulled into the Bennett Residence garage.    
  
Elliot seemed pleased. He grabbed the handbag from the back seat and hurried off.    
  
A few steps away, he suddenly remembered Lauren. His body stiffened, and when he turned back, there was still a trace of awkwardness on his face.    
  
""Go change into a proper gown and head to the banquet hall.""    
  
With that, he left without looking back.    
  
After five years, this house was still as unfamiliar to Lauren as ever.    
  
She had never felt an ounce of warmth here.    
  
This place wasn't even as good as the orphanage.    
  
At the orphanage, she hadn't had a private room, but at least she had shared a sunlit dorm.    
  
When the sun rose, light would pour through the windows, filling the room with warmth.    
  
Back then, she loved the scent of blankets basked in sunlight. It made her feel like she had a home.    
  
But after returning here, she realized that her so-called home wasn't the scent of sun-warmed blankets.    
  
It was the damp, musty stench of a place the sun never reached.    
  
She pushed open the door.    
  
The room was small, windowless, and packed with clutter.    
  
The only two pieces of furniture were a single folding cot and an old desk.    
  
This was the storage room that served as her bedroom for three years.    
  
Elliot had told her to wear a proper gown.    
  
But she had never owned one.  
  
For years, she had only had one set of her high school uniform. The T-shirt and jeans she was wearing now had been bought with money she earned from a holiday job on Amazon, for five bucks total.    
  
She still remembered the day she had happily put them on and asked Elliot how she looked.    
  
His brows had furrowed in disgust.    
  
""What the hell are you wearing? Can't you learn to dress elegantly and properly like Willow? Take it off and get rid of it! Don't embarrass our family.""



**Chapter 3 Canceled Her Allowance**



Willow's poise and elegance had been built with money and resources.    
  
In contrast, Lauren had nothing.    
  
The Bennett family neither gave her much love nor much money, yet they still blamed her for not being poised and elegant enough.    
  
Even now, she didn't understand why they had brought her back.    
  
Her only purpose in this family was to make Willow, the adopted daughter, seem more beloved.    
  
There was a saying, ""Those who are unloved are the outsiders."" It fit her unexpectedly well.    
  
Back then, their unfairness had made her sad. Now, she no longer cared.    
  
She scanned the storage room. The only clothing she had to change into was her old blue-and-white high school uniform.    
  
Five years ago, she had received an acceptance letter from Northcrest University, the top institution in Corwynale.    
  
Yet, the Bennett family had only thrown a grand celebration for Willow's college entrance.    
  
That banquet had gathered every elite figure in Hoverdale.    
  
Eighteen-year-old Willow had stood in the center of it all, draped in a custom-made gown worth millions, wearing a diamond-studded crown, basking in the spotlight like a princess between her adoptive parents.  
  
Meanwhile, Lauren had looked shabby and out of place, an ugly duckling among swans. Under the gaze of the entire crowd, she had been taken away by the police, spending the next five years in prison, losing the college life that should have been hers.    
  
...  
  
Five minutes later, dressed in her uniform, Lauren headed toward the banquet hall of the Bennett Residence.    
  
On the way, passing servants cast curious glances at her.    
  
""Who's that? Why is she here in a high school uniform?""    
  
""She's probably one of the hotel staff brought in for the event. Looks like a student working a summer job.""    
  
""Mr. David and Madam Alice treat Ms. Willow so well. They even invited the top chef from Lavette Grand Hotel just for her celebration.""    
  
""Exactly.""    
  
As one servant walked past Lauren, they didn't forget to remind her, ""The banquet is about to begin. Go change into the standard uniform. You must be careful while serving. Tonight's guests are all important figures in Hoverdale.""    
  
With that, the servant left.    
  
Lauren stood there, suddenly losing the desire to go to the banquet hall.    
  
Elliot had told her that her parents had prepared a welcome banquet for her. But he hadn't mentioned that they had invited outsiders.    
  
Being released from prison was nothing to celebrate.   
  
*Did they really need to make such a spectacle out of it?*    
  
Five years ago, she had been taken away in handcuffs in front of all of Hoverdale's elites.    
  
Now, they wanted to gather those same people and publicly celebrate the return of a convict.    
  
To her, this wasn't a welcome. It was a public humiliation, stripping away every last shred of dignity she had left.    
  
A mix of bitterness and anger surged within her. She didn't want to stay here any longer.    
  
She turned to leave.    
  
But just then, Elliot appeared, his expression darkening the moment he saw what she was wearing.    
  
He strode toward her, his voice sharp with irritation. ""Didn't I tell you to change into a gown? Why did you come dressed like this? Do you have any idea what kind of occasion this is?""    
  
Lauren opened her mouth to explain, but Elliot cut her off mercilessly.    
  
""You looked like a mess when you got out of prison, and now that you're back, you want to put on a pitiful act in front of everyone? Do you want people to think the Bennett family has mistreated you? Lauren, your manipulative tricks are just as disgusting as ever. You're beyond saving.""    
  
As he spoke, he reached out to grab her, still cursing under his breath. ""Go change. Stop embarrassing yourself!""    
  
Lauren sidestepped him.    
  
Elliot's hand caught nothing but air. His anger flared. ""How dare you dodge me?""    
  
Lauren lifted her gaze to meet his. He looked at her as if she were his worst enemy.    
  
That look—disgusted, impatient, filled with contempt—she had endured it for three years in the Bennett family.    
  
Every time their eyes met, it felt like invisible hands were tearing her heart apart. The tears she had once held back had only ever earned her a sneer of ""stop acting.""    
  
Maybe she had gotten used to it.    
  
Or maybe five years in prison had crushed her self-worth.    
  
Now, even as she faced his deep-seated hatred, she felt nothing.    
  
His opinions no longer had the power to affect her.    
  
Lauren's expression remained calm, distant, unyielding. ""I don't have a gown.""    
  
Elliot's fury grew. ""If you don't have one, then buy one!""    
  
Lauren took a deep breath. Elliot was too biased against her. No matter what she said, he wouldn't believe her.    
  
She had tried explaining in the past.    
  
But the more she explained, the more he accused her of lying. He had slandered her without restraint.    
  
It was exhausting. She didn't want to explain anymore.    
  
So she simply said, ""I have no money.""    
  
Elliot's brows knitted together, his rage burning hotter. ""For three years, you lived here without worrying about food or clothing. The company transfers 70,000 dollars to your account every month. Over three years, that totaled 2.5 million dollars. And you're telling me you couldn't afford a decent dress? You're doing this on purpose, trying to make people think our family mistreated you! Lauren, you can't be this selfish. We've already compensated you. Enough is enough. If you keep acting like this, it's just pathetic!""    
  
Lauren had expected this. No matter what she said, she would never be believed.    
  
She stared at him, unblinking.    
  
For some reason, under her steady gaze, Elliot felt a brief pang of unease.    
  
""What are you looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything wrong.""    
  
*He isn't wrong?*    
  
Lauren let out a cold, silent laugh.    
  
She hadn't wanted to make a scene.    
  
But Elliot's aggressive accusations stirred something dark in her.    
  
Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed people approaching.    
  
Since they wanted a commotion, she would give them one.    
  
She had already lost her dignity. She had nothing left to lose.    
  
But Elliot, who cared so much about his reputation, couldn't handle being humiliated in public.   
  
""I never received a single cent from your company. Not 70,000 dollars. Not even seven bucks. Mr. Elliot, if you want to accuse me, at least come up with a more believable lie.""    
  
Elliot's eyes darkened with even more disgust.    
  
""You just won't give up, will you? Fine. Don't blame me for exposing you.""    
  
He pulled out his phone and called the company's finance department, putting the call on speaker.    
  
""Check how much money the finance department has transferred to Lauren's account every month.""    
  
The person on the other end hesitated. ""Lauren? You mean Ms. Bennett?""    
  
""Yes.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, if you're referring to Ms. Bennett, there's no need to check.""    
  
Elliot frowned. ""What do you mean?""    
  
""Well, we never transferred any money to Ms. Bennett's account.""    
  
Elliot froze.    
  
""That's impossible,"" he said sharply.    
  
*Lauren may not be well-liked, but she's still the daughter of the Bennett family. How could she not have an allowance?*  
  
The night she was brought home, he had discussed it with his parents. To be fair, they had decided to give Lauren the same monthly allowance as Willow.    
  
There was no way he had remembered it wrong.    
  
""I personally gave the order.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, you might not know this, but Madam Alice said that Ms. Bennett came from an orphanage and had poor judgment. She was afraid Ms. Bennett would fall in with the wrong crowd if she suddenly had that much money. Since Ms. Bennett was a high school student back then and had no major expenses, Madam Alice canceled her allowance.""    
  
Elliot's mind buzzed.    
  
*No allowance... That means Lauren hasn't received a single penny in the entire three years she's lived with us.*  
  
""Oh, and Madam Alice doubled Ms. Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars a month. She was worried Ms. Willow would feel neglected, so the extra 70,000 dollars was meant to comfort her. You knew about that, right, Mr. Elliot?""    
  
Elliot felt like someone had strangled him.    
  
He had not known.



**Chapter 4 You Have No Idea**



As the crowd grew, more and more people gathered around, all having heard the voice coming from the telephone receiver.    
  
Everyone present was stunned.    
  
The Bennett family wasn't the richest in Hoverdale, but it was still a prominent aristocratic household.    
  
For children of wealthy families, having a monthly allowance of 14,000 dollars was perfectly normal.    
  
They had never heard of a wealthy heiress who didn't even get a single cent in allowance.    
  
The Bennett family was the first.    
  
No wonder Lauren dressed so poorly, without even a decent gown to wear to a banquet.    
  
Even if she hadn't been raised by their side, she was still the real daughter of the Bennett family. Yet they gave her nothing while showering their adopted daughter with 140,000 dollars a month.    
  
For the Bennett family to allow such an outrageous situation to happen, they must have been utterly blind.    
  
The guests whispered among themselves. Elliot felt a chill down his spine, his face flushing with shame and anger.    
  
He refused to believe something so humiliating could happen to the Bennett family.    
  
Their family was wealthy and powerful. There was no way they would be too stingy to give their own flesh and blood a mere allowance.    
  
Elliot immediately questioned Lauren in a cold voice, ""Even if the finance department didn't transfer the money, Mom and Dad must have given you an allowance, right?""    
  
Lauren's lips curled in mockery. She glanced at David Bennett and Alice Pierce in the crowd and said lightly, ""Why don't you ask Mr. David and Madam Alice whether they gave me an allowance or not, Mr. Elliot? After all, you don't believe me, but you'd believe your parents, wouldn't you?""    
  
David and Alice stiffened instantly, too ashamed to meet her eyes.    
  
""Dad, Mom, you must have given her an allowance, right?"" Elliot looked at them seriously.    
  
David avoided his gaze. ""I thought you guys would give it to her, so I...""    
  
Alice's face was filled with guilt, tears welling in her eyes. She said painfully, ""I thought you guys would... Laurie, why didn't you say something sooner? If you had told me earlier, I would have given you money. It's my fault. I didn't realize it in time, and you suffered for it. But you have to believe that I treat you and Willow the same.""    
  
Lauren looked at her with a half-smile, her gaze indifferent. Under her cold stare, Alice lowered her eyes awkwardly.    
  
Only today did Lauren find out that it was her own birth mother who had ordered the finance department not to send her money. Not only that, but she had also raised Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars, afraid that her precious adopted daughter might feel slighted.    
  
With such blatant favoritism, Alice still had the audacity to claim she treated them equally.    
  
As the esteemed wife of a wealthy family, Alice wore only the finest clothes, with even her socks costing dozens of dollars. There was no way she couldn't tell that her own daughter was wearing an outfit that cost less than 14 bucks in total.  
  
Of course, she knew. She just didn't care.    
  
This apology was nothing more than an act for the public.    
  
Fortunately, Lauren had long seen through the ugliness of this family. Her heart had been hardened, immune to their poison. Without expectations, she remained unshaken.    
  
Seeing Lauren ignore her mother's apology, humiliating the Bennett family in front of everyone, Elliot's fleeting guilt instantly vanished.    
  
He scolded coldly, ""You have a mouth, don't you? Why didn't you just say something? We're not mind readers; how were we supposed to know what you were thinking? If you had spoken up earlier, do you think we wouldn't have given you money?""    
  
""I did."" Lauren's voice was soft but laced with coldness. ""You just didn't take it seriously.""    
  
Elliot frowned, about to deny it, when a memory suddenly surfaced in his mind.    
  
It was an afternoon long ago. Their family of four sat on the couch, chatting and laughing.    
  
Lauren walked over hesitantly, clutching the hem of her school uniform. Before she even spoke, her face flushed bright red.    
  
She struggled for a long time before finally whispering, ""Dad, Mom, can you give me the tuition fee of 700...""    
  
*Bang!*    
  
Elliot slammed his newspaper onto the coffee table, glaring at Lauren. ""Money, money, money! Is that all you care about? Did you come back to this family just to ask for money? If the Bennett family had no money, would you have even bothered to return? I don't know why Mom and Dad insisted on bringing you back. If you have nothing better to do, go study. Willow ranked tenth in the whole school in her first monthly exam. What about you?""    
  
""I... I got first place....""    
  
""Enough. You mean dead last, right? And you still have the nerve to bring it up?""    
  
He had already arranged for the finance department to deposit 70,000 dollars into her card every month, yet she dared to open her mouth and ask for money.    
  
Even Willow didn't receive that much, so she had no reason to think she deserved it.  
  
Lauren's tears fell instantly, as if she had suffered a great injustice.    
  
Elliot only felt irritated, even losing the mood to read his financial newspaper.    
  
Luckily, Willow was understanding. She tugged on his arm and pouted. ""Elliot, I ranked tenth this time. Do I get a reward?""    
  
He couldn't resist his sweet little sister acting cute. Instantly, all his annoyance from Lauren disappeared. Pinching Willow's cheek, he doted on her. ""Willow, what do you want?""    
  
""I saw a handbag worth 14,000 dollars. Elliot, will you buy it for me?""    
  
""Of course. If you like it, I'd even buy one for 140,000 dollars.""    
  
After spoiling Willow, he turned back to Lauren with a scowl. ""Why are you still standing here? Go back to your room and study.""    
  
Lauren bit back her grievances and ran away.    
  
David and Alice sighed at the same time. ""If only Laurie were half as sensible as Willow.""    
  
...  
  
""Mr. Elliot, have you remembered?""    
  
Lauren's voice pulled him back to the present. His heart twisted painfully at the way she addressed him—Mr. Elliot.    
  
He was her biological brother, not some stranger.    
  
But ever since she was released from prison, she hadn't called him by his name even once.    
  
His expression darkened, his voice laced with frustration. ""It was because you were terrible at studying. Coming in dead last, how did you have the nerve to ask for money? Even I was embarrassed for you.""    
  
Hearing this, Lauren's gaze turned even colder. Being stared at with such icy indifference, Elliot felt an inexplicable sense of guilt. He clenched his jaw and snapped, ""You don't accept criticism?""    
  
""For all three years of high school, I ranked first in my grade every year. How did I suddenly become in last place in your version of the story?""    
  
Seeing Elliot's expression of utter disbelief, Lauren smirked coldly. A sense of vindictive satisfaction rose within her. ""Then again, it's understandable. Mr. Elliot, you don't even know which school I attended. Naturally, you wouldn't know my grades.""    
  
Elliot felt like he had been struck by lightning, frozen in place.    
  
It was as if he had just heard something absurd. His voice trembled slightly, betraying a hint of hoarseness. ""You weren't attending Brightvale High School?""    
  
Brightvale High School was the most prestigious school in Hoverdale. Willow had graduated from there, and all the wealthy and powerful families in the city sent their children there.    
  
Elliot had simply assumed Lauren was studying there as well.    
  
His gaze snapped to David and Alice, his voice shaking uncontrollably. ""Dad, Mom, when Lauren came back, did you transfer her school records over?""    
  
Silence.    
  
David's face turned red, his lips moving soundlessly like a man who had lost his backbone. All his past authority vanished.    
  
Alice's lips quivered. Panic and guilt filled her eyes, her perfectly applied makeup unable to conceal her embarrassment.    
  
The two stood there, frozen, as if the air around them had solidified.    
  
Elliot's face turned pale, inch by inch. His previous perception of Lauren crumbled like a collapsing tower. All the disdain and condescension he had once felt now twisted into sharp blades, cutting into his own heart.    
  
His throat tightened painfully, his voice barely audible. ""Laurie, where did you go to school for those three years?""



**Chapter 5 Her Birthday Party**



Lauren's life had already been ruined, and only then did Elliot remember to care about her academics. How ironic.    
  
She had spent ten years studying desperately, hoping to change her fate. Just as her efforts were about to bear fruit, she found that they were ultimately no match for power.    
  
With a single, offhand remark, the Bennett family sealed her fate, effortlessly casting her into the deepest depths of hell.    
  
She could have had a bright future.    
  
From childhood to adulthood, she never had the advantage of a powerful family background. The only thing she could rely on was her extraordinary dedication to her studies.    
  
Her dream was to get into Northcrest University, then pursue a master's degree and a doctorate. She wanted to become a professor, to stand at the podium and use her knowledge to change the fate of those who, like her, worked tirelessly to succeed.    
  
But reality had slapped her in the face.    
  
She did not become the person she had wanted to be. Instead, she became a despised criminal, forever marked by a stain on her record.    
  
A stain that would affect three generations.    
  
Thinking of this, Lauren clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt nothing.    
  
""Hoverdale First High School."" Lauren's voice was soft, almost gentle.    
  
Yet the four words, ""Hoverdale First High School,"" weighed like a thousand-pound boulder, making David, Alice, and Elliot feel as though they could hardly breathe.    
  
Because Hoverdale First High School had the highest admission standards in all of Hoverdale.    
  
Unlike Brightvale High School, a prestigious private school where admission was secured with money, Hoverdale First High School only recognized scores, not wealth.    
  
Even among top students, she had consistently ranked first in her grade year after year. With her grades, getting into Northcrest University had been a certainty.    
  
""That's impossible. You're lying."" Elliot's emotions were on edge. ""Hoverdale First High School is in the suburbs, more than 20 miles from home. Back then, you rode that old bike every day...""  
  
Mid-sentence, Elliot suddenly realized something. The rest of his words got stuck in his throat.    
  
Watching the color drain from Elliot's face, Lauren's lips curled in mockery. ""I'd rather ride a bike than go to school with Willow. We never even attended the same school. I never ate breakfast with you because morning classes at Hoverdale First High School started at six. I had to wake up at four to bike for two hours just to get there. I never came home for lunch because there wasn't enough time to bike back. I didn't have money for food, so I just drank more water to hold on until evening. By the time I finally got home, you had already eaten. All that was left for me was cold leftovers, and even then, you mocked me, saying I had a lowly fate, that I preferred eating scraps over hot food, that I devoured leftovers like a starving ghost...""    
  
""Laurie, I'm sorry."" Alice's tears fell like broken pearls, her sobs heart-wrenching. ""I didn't know you suffered so much. It's all my fault.""    
  
""There's nothing for you to apologize for."" Lauren looked at Alice's tear-streaked face, her heart as calm as still water. ""I wasn't raised by you. It's understandable that you feel nothing for me. I've long been used to this. A little more suffering wouldn't have made a difference. Don't you agree, Madam Alice?""    
  
Alice's sobs hitched.    
  
*Laurie, I'm begging you. You're stronger than Willow; you can endure hardship. You took care of yourself just fine in the orphanage, so I believe you'll manage in prison too. Please, take the fall for Willow.*    
  
A five-year-old memory came surging back. Alice looked stricken, clutching her chest as if she were about to faint.    
  
Lauren watched coldly as Alice swayed unsteadily. Her heart was full of contempt.    
  
The place where Willow had pushed Elaine down the stairs had surveillance cameras.    
  
But after the incident, Alice had immediately erased the footage that could have proven Lauren's innocence. That was why Lauren had been unable to defend herself in court.    
  
""Enough!"" Elliot snapped at Lauren, his voice cold. ""Stop being so bitter. We neglected you and that was our oversight. But do you really bear no responsibility at all? You were jealous that Willow had a better life than you, so you bullied her and took revenge on us. Your heart is twisted, and no one likes you. Instead of reflecting on yourself, you blame us first.""    
  
""Elliot, don't speak to your sister that way."" Alice sniffled.    
  
""Mom, you're still defending her? She's just taking advantage of our guilt, pushing her limits. Otherwise, she wouldn't have framed Willow by shoving Elaine down the stairs and making her a vegetable. We already sent her to prison for five years, but she still holds a grudge, making a scene in front of all these guests.""    
  
Alice felt a pang of guilt. She quickly looked at Lauren, only to find Lauren staring back at her with a faint, knowing smile.

We're your **top-rated Expedia Cruises on Google in California** and your dedicated ""Travel Experts for Air, Land, and Sea!"" We're loving our new Reddit community at r**/expedia\_cruises**, and today we want to dedicate this post to everyone thinking about their **VERY FIRST CRUISE!**

Taking the plunge into the world of cruising can seem like a lot at first, but trust us, it's an incredible way to see the world, and we're here to make it super easy and exciting for you.

Why Your First Cruise Will Amaze You!

The world of cruising is all about innovation and incredible experiences!

* **Unpack Once, Explore Many:** Imagine visiting multiple dream destinations without constantly packing and unpacking. Your hotel travels with you!
* **Ships are Destinations Themselves:** Modern cruise ships are marvels of architecture, offering luxurious spaces, cutting-edge amenities, and an unrelenting attention to detail.
* **The Perfect Blend:** Enjoy total relaxation when you want it and thrilling adventures when you're ready. Savor delicious meals from master chefs onboard and authentic local flavors ashore.
* **Incredible Value:** So much is included, making it a fantastic way to manage your vacation budget while enjoying top-notch service, dining, and entertainment.

Demystifying Your Cruise Fare: What's Usually Included? 💰

Think of your cruise ship as a luxury floating hotel where you wake up to new scenery! Generally, your cruise fare includes:

* **Your Well-Appointed Stateroom:** Your cozy home away from home.
* **Delicious Dining:** Main dining rooms, buffets, and other eateries are part of the package.
* **Many Beverages:** Coffee, tea, water, and often juices are typically included.
* **Room Service:** Often available for those lazy mornings or late-night snacks.
* **Most Onboard Entertainment:** Broadway-style shows, live music in piano bars, poolside fun, comedy acts, and magic shows!
* **Fun Activities:** Access to pools, waterslides, sports courts, kids' programs, and fitness center equipment.

Good to Know: What's Typically Extra? (No Surprises!)

While a ton is included, some things usually carry an additional charge, varying by cruise line:

* Specialty coffees, sodas, and alcoholic beverages.
* Meals in alternative or specialty restaurants (for those extra-special dining experiences).
* Spa and salon services (massages, facials, etc.).
* Certain fitness classes (like Yoga or Pilates).
* Casino gaming.
* Organized shore excursions booked through the cruise line.
* Laundry services.
* Gratuities (often added to your shipboard account, a thank you to the hardworking crew!).

Life Aboard: Relaxed, Entertaining, and Yours to Design! 💃🕺

There's never a dull moment (unless you want one!).

* **What to Expect:** Live performances, poolside parties, cooking classes, enrichment lectures, adult-only quiet zones, and more! How you spend your day is entirely up to you. Expect gracious and exceptional service.
* **Dress Code:** It varies, but ""resort casual"" is a great rule of thumb (sundresses, skirts, golf shirts, slacks). Many cruises have optional ""formal nights"" if you want to dress up, but the super formal vibe of the past has relaxed a lot. Swimwear is for the pool deck, and you'll want a cover-up for indoor dining.

So Many Activities! A Taste of What's Onboard:

Cruise lines are constantly innovating! You might find:

* Broadway Shows & Live Music
* Water Parks, Waterslides & Rock Climbing Walls
* Ice Skating Rinks & Mini Golf
* Enrichment Classes (cooking, dance) & Trivia Contests
* Casinos & Bingo
* Relaxing Spas & Fitness Centers
* Libraries & Card Rooms
* Kids & Teens Clubs

The excitement of planning is part of the fun!

* **We Make it Simple:** Contact us, and we'll guide you through finding the ideal cruise. We work to make your booking seamless.
* **Book in Advance:** We can help you book a cruise up to 18 months out, often with just a low refundable deposit required initially.
* **Finding Your Match:** Whether you're dreaming of the Caribbean, Alaska, Europe, or Mexico, we'll help you find the perfect cruise line, ship, and itinerary for your style and budget.

**A Few Pro Tips Before You Sail:** 📋

* **Travel Documentation:** A passport is generally your best bet! We can advise on specific requirements.
* **Travel Insurance:** Highly recommended to protect your investment and for peace of mind.
* **Onboard Account:** Most ships operate on a cashless system using a ""cruise card"" linked to your account. Notify your credit card company of your travel plans!

----------------------------------------------------------------

Many people find losing weight a very hard thing. It does not always go as planned. Can a special kind of coffee make it easier? Some talk about coffee with mushrooms inside. This drink has become a topic of talk. I will look at if this mushroom coffee helps your body get smaller. It is not clear if this drink is a magic answer for losing weight. Maybe it works in other ways. I will check what the idea is behind this drink and body size. You will learn about the parts inside. See what the simple facts might be.

What Exactly Is Mushroom Coffee?
--------------------------------

This drink is not just like normal coffee. It starts with coffee beans, yes. But they add powder from special mushrooms. These are not the mushrooms you put on pizza. These are called adaptogen mushrooms. They say these mushrooms help your body handle hard things. People dry these mushrooms first. Then they grind them into a very fine powder. This powder goes into the coffee mix. So, you get coffee taste. You also get something from the mushroom powder. You can mix it with hot water. It is like making instant coffee usually. Some kinds are beans with the mushroom powder mixed in. You can buy this mix ready to use. It is a different kind of coffee to drink in the morning.

The Potential Science Behind Mushroom Coffee and Weight Management
------------------------------------------------------------------

People wonder how this coffee might touch body weight. The ideas connect to the mushrooms, I see. These special mushrooms might do things in the body. One idea is they help manage stress. High stress can make some people eat more food. It might make the body hold onto fat sometimes. If the mushroom helps lower stress, this might stop some overeating. Another idea connects to energy. Some mushrooms might give you more energy. If you have more energy, you might move your body more. More moving burns more calories. Burning more calories can help lower body weight. These are the thoughts people have. It is about what the mushrooms might do, not just the coffee part.

Specific Mushrooms and Their Potential Impact on Weight
-------------------------------------------------------

Different mushrooms go into this coffee blend. Each mushroom has its own special name. People say they do different things for the body. Two common ones are called Reishi and Cordyceps. Reishi mushroom might help with feeling calm. Cordyceps mushroom might help with feeling strong and active. These ideas come from old traditions and some studies. How these specific mushrooms might touch your body weight is interesting. It is not a direct way like a diet pill. It is more about helping your body work better overall. This overall help could maybe, just maybe, have a small effect on your body size over a long time.

### Reishi and Stress Reduction: An Indirect Link to Weight

Reishi mushroom is a type people put in this coffee. This mushroom is known for helping the body feel less stressed. When people feel very stressed, their body can make a special thing called cortisol. Too much cortisol can make the body want to store fat. It can make you feel hungry more often. Especially for sweet or fatty foods. So, if Reishi helps lower stress feelings, maybe it lowers cortisol too. Less stress might mean less urge to eat unhealthy food. It might help your body not hold onto fat as much. This is not a promise, it is just an idea people talk about. It is an indirect way the mushroom *might* connect to body weight.

### Cordyceps and Energy Levels: Fueling Activity

Another mushroom you find in this coffee is called Cordyceps. People talk about Cordyceps giving more energy. They say it can help your body use oxygen better. If your body uses oxygen well, you might feel less tired. You might have more power to do things. Having more energy can make you want to move more. You might exercise more often. You might walk more steps in a day. Doing more physical things burns more energy from your body. This can help you lose body fat. So, Cordyceps might help body weight by making you more active. It is not burning fat itself. It is giving you fuel to burn fat with movement.

Does Research Directly Support Mushroom Coffee for Weight Loss?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Does looking at studies show this coffee helps lose weight? This is a good question to ask. I see claims online and in shops. But finding direct proof for the coffee blend is hard. Most studies look at the individual mushrooms, not the coffee mixed with them. They test Reishi alone or Cordyceps alone, for example. They check how these single mushrooms affect bodies or cells in lab tests. They do not test the coffee drink itself on people who want to lose weight. So, we do not have studies that say ""drinking mushroom coffee helps people lose X amount of weight."" This kind of direct answer is missing right now.

### What Studies Say About Individual Mushrooms

Research has looked at the mushrooms separately. Some studies on Reishi look at stress or sleep. They might find Reishi helps people feel calmer or rest better. Studies on Cordyceps might look at exercise ability. Some tests show Cordyceps could help with using oxygen during activity. There are also studies looking at these mushrooms and other health markers in the body. Sometimes they use animals or just look at cells. Studies directly on human bodies are needed more. Even when a study shows something positive for one mushroom, it does not mean it works the same way when you mix it with coffee and drink it.

### Why Direct Evidence is Limited for the Coffee Blend

Finding studies on mushroom coffee for losing body weight is difficult. This is because it is a newer product people are using. Scientists take time to set up studies. They need to test the exact blend of coffee and mushrooms people drink. They need many people to test it on. They need to watch them for many months. These studies cost a lot of money and take many years. Right now, most science focused on the single mushroom types. The specific mix people buy in a bag is not studied as much. So, we do not have science that says, ""This mushroom coffee helps you lose kilos."" This is why the direct proof is small.

Other Potential Health Benefits of Mushroom Coffee
--------------------------------------------------

People drink mushroom coffee for more than just the idea of losing weight. They talk about other good things it might do. Some feel more focus after drinking it. They say their mind feels clearer. Some think it helps their body fight off sickness better. This relates to the immune system. Adaptogen mushrooms are often linked to helping the body stay strong. People also mention less jitters compared to normal coffee. Regular coffee can make some people feel jumpy or anxious. The mushroom part might balance this effect for some drinkers. These are other reasons why people choose this drink.

Important Considerations Before Trying Mushroom Coffee for Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinking about trying this coffee to help with your body size? Stop and think about some things first. It is not safe for everyone. Some people have health problems. They take medicine for these problems. Mushroom extracts can sometimes interact with medicine. It is important to talk to a doctor first. This is very true if you have heart problems, blood problems, or take any regular medicine. Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding should also be careful. Side effects can happen for some people. Stomach upset, feeling dizzy, or dry mouth are some things reported. Start with a small amount to see how your body reacts.

### Who Should Be Cautious? Potential Side Effects and Interactions

Certain people must be extra careful with mushroom coffee. If you have a condition that affects your immune system, ask a doctor. Some mushrooms can make the immune system more active. This might not be good for some conditions. If you are having surgery soon, stop taking it. Mushrooms might affect how your blood clots. People with liver problems also need to be careful. As I said, check your medicines. Blood thinners, medicines for diabetes, or medicines that suppress the immune system could have issues with mushroom extracts. Side effects are usually mild, but everyone is different. Pay attention to your body.

### Setting Realistic Expectations: It's Not a Magic Pill

Do not think mushroom coffee will make body fat disappear fast. It is not a quick fix. No single food or drink is. Losing weight in a healthy way takes time. It needs many changes. You must eat balanced food. You must move your body regularly. Getting enough sleep helps too. Managing your stress is also key. Mushroom coffee might, maybe, support these things in a small way through the mushrooms' effects. But drinking it alone will not make a big difference in body size. It is a small part of a bigger healthy life picture. Have real thoughts about what it can do.

Integrating Mushroom Coffee into a Healthy Lifestyle
----------------------------------------------------

If you decide to try mushroom coffee, put it into your healthy habits. Do not just add the coffee. Keep doing your good things. Keep eating fruits, vegetables, and good proteins. Drink lots of water. Make time to walk or exercise. Try to get enough rest each night. Maybe the coffee helps you feel a bit more energetic for your walk. Maybe it helps you feel calmer so you don't stress-eat. Use it as a possible small help, not the main plan. One cup in the morning can be part of your routine. See if you notice any good changes with your energy or mood.

Conclusion
----------

While mushroom coffee offers various potential health benefits, direct scientific evidence specifically linking the coffee blend to significant weight loss is currently limited. Its potential influence on weight is more likely indirect, stemming from the properties of the individual adaptogenic mushrooms it contains, such as stress reduction, improved energy, or potential metabolic support. Remember, no single food or drink is a standalone solution for weight loss. For sustainable results, focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress management. If you're considering adding mushroom coffee to your routine, especially for health reasons, consult with a healthcare professional to ensure it's right for you.

I felt that way from the first time I've heard it. I love metaphors and I've never been impressed by money or flashy things. All my life, I've never given much care about money bc I always knew that money can't get you happiness or love or anything. But also, I like honey in my coffee and boys who use their backs... and I'd rather go to a live show at a local venue (""smaller acts"") then spend a bunch of money going to a big concert with some famous celebrity. But you tell most guys that all you care about is being loved as long as the bills are paid & there's food on the table & they never believe it. Nobody trusts a truly genuine person. (I've had ppl call me fake bc of how honest and genuine i am)... I'm truly the kind of woman who will ""only love you for you."" 

Too bad I'm too broken now to trust anyone to love me for me. And I've never had a man love me for me, 100%. They always ""loved"" me for the idealization of me that they had in their head.... and then when I didn't live up to that expectation, they didn't love me anymore. 

So, to those out there who are lucky enough to have found their person, you better hold on to the girl/guy/they/them who loves you for you bc it's the rarest thing in the world. ",2,1748673094.0,zachbryan,0,0.63,False

Over the past couple of years I got more and more interested in building ""something"" next to my regular job., and the thought of making my own product becomes more and more interesting to me. This product could essentially be anything: a physical product, software, service etc.

My strong side and educational background is clearly electronics development (all phases), so this is clearly the value I add, though my interests are much wider spread and I am a strong believer that with the right people, anything is possible.

While I'm good at sorting out the technical details of the product, the bigger picture and application is quite often missing. So I'm wondering if there are people in this sub that are interested in tinkering about ideas and eventually transforming them into a finished product. The idea could be as little as a single webpage or a humidity sensor, or as big as where only the sky is the limit. Applications are secondary. Drones, MedTech, IoT, Agriculture, Coffee, Entertainment, Audio, Cameras, 3D scanning etc - I'm sure there are pain points to be addressed in all areas. So maybe you already know something to be solved, but lack the knowledge and resources / network to get it done? 

Again, this product could be anything: physical, pure software, APIs, a service, a blog, you name it.

Cremator ( Bloodied, Hitman, INT, Pyromaniac)

For events to tag enemies I use  
Tesla Cannon (Bloodied, Explosive, INT, Pin-Pointer)

For caravan runs, purely to heal the Brahmin, I use  
Thirst Zapper (Medic, Rapid)

Even though I have a Gatling Plasma with Stinging Core Receptacle and Accelerated Nozzle on it, I do not use it because I don't own the Plasma Core Recharger as I dislike managing hundreds of un-fully charged cores. I'm okay with the Gatling Laser as I do have the Fusion Core Recharger and I can charge to store them in my ammo box (sitting at 500 cores atm).

In terms of mutation, I have these:

Adrenal Reaction

Bird Bones

Carnivore

Chameleon

Egg Head

Electrically Charged

Herd Mentality

Marsupial

Plague Walker

Speed Demon

Unstable Isotope

(Thinking of getting Twisted Muscles so I can benefit from the spread to the Cremator, cus from what i understand the negative Gun accuracy helps cover more area. Although not sure how much it's going to affect other weapons)

Speaking slightly about mutation, are there any other recommended ones to get?

The reason why I went with Carnivore is because of convenience, as I picked up the Mirelurk Steamer for its ""Smoked Mirelurk Fillets"" for the +60/75 lbs Carry Weight. With the backpack and the high capacity mod, this brings my total carry weight to above 600 lbs.

""Cooked Softshell Meat"" for +40/50 Max AP, Pemmican Collector for its ""Pemican"" for +6/8 END, Critter Cooker for its ""Squirrel On A Stick"" for +6/8 AGI. This sets my total AP to roughly over 650+

As for other C.A.M.P items that benefits my character (that I can think of) , I have the Company Tea Machine and the Coffee Machine.

With all that said, I wonder if any of the perk cards listed is redundant or can be swapped for another?

God Bless, thanks!

PS:

Also a bit unrelated, I learnt that I do not have to stay on top of my foundry smelter, radiation barrel, toxic goo or slime cake to drop my health to 20% as I can use the Gamma Gun (Bloodied, Hitman, INT, and Polished) w/ Deep Dish, Sharpshooter's Grip, and Electric Signal Carrier Antennae.

How can I make the Gamma Gun shoot once to drop my health to 20%. As of right now whenever I died, I respawn with 25% health, and a single shot of my Gamma Gun brings it down to 20.5%. Currently it does 160 dmg when I'm at 25%.

Even when Polished wasn't in effect, it dealt around 117 damage but still drops me down to only 20.5%. Are there anything else I can do to make it require one shot then two?

PSS:

If possible, could you (the ones that are reading the post) help optimized it for the patch that is coming in a few days times.

Thanks again! Appreciate the community!

Edit:

Opps I forgot to mention, I have a set of Union PA w/ Overeater, INT, Thru-Hiker, and Rejuvenator. I use it when I'm in nuke areas or when I'm doing Raids with the caveat that I leave the PA right before the stage ends to get Unyielding benefits.

Edit 2:

Even with the 3 Science cards (Science , Science Expert, Science Master), a dmg of 174 (from 160) per shot still only brings my health to 20.5%",1,1748672638.0,fo76,2,0.67,False

I bought a beautiful piece of agar wood (50cm x 30x 20) that I would like to take/send home to the netherlands. But according to CITES it's on appendix B (Aquilaria banaense), which means you need a permit to import it. 

Just curious if I send it home in a package with other stuff (clothes, coffee etc) if it will cause issues. Will the package be blocked, will they take the wood out or is it not that strict? 

I dont want to get a permit as it costs at least €60 from what ive found. The piece itself was €7 so doesnt seem worth it.
