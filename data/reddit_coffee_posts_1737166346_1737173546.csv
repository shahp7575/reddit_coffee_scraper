","I'm coming up just shy of 4 years owning my TK-01. *For the most part*, it's been a blast. My best coffee purchases have been made at 1 or 2 in the morning from an ad on Instagram 😄. We had a manual espresso machine, and it was clunky and messy. I was ready to move on, and then I discovered TK. I researched and looked and researched some more. I watched a LOT of reviews, and finally decided the super-automatic life was for us! From the first cup, it was love. It was like a beautiful honeymoon for 2 entire years. I sang the praises of TK to anyone that would listen, and all 3 of my brothers bought one too (one a TK-02)! 

About 2 weeks after the warranty ended (and I'm a little fuzzy on this...new machines come with a 1 year warranty, but when I reached out to them, I mentioned a 2 year warranty and they rolled with it), I put in a ticket for crackling sounds coming from the back of the machine. I opened the back and there was a lot of ground beans and moisture all in the back. The crackling caused the power connection inside to blacken. I explained everything and mentioned my 3 referrals, and they agreed to fix it ""under warranty""! Everyone was happy when I got the machine back a few weeks later and was drinking my Americanos again. 9 months later, the steam line broke and steam was hydrating the internals of the machine 😬. Oh, the blackened connector was still blackened from the first warranty repair...I would have thought that would have been replaced...*for safety*. I also got 2 more referrals - up to 5, WOO! Anyway, I paid my $185.50 and got my machine back a few weeks later (still blackened), and all was right again. 8 months later and the machine won't even turn on. The power comes on, but it's stuck on ""Starting up..."" [According to this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraKaffe/comments/1dp2u1k/tk01_in_permanent_boot_up_mode/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), it needs a thermoblock repair. After another $185.50, we'll be in for $1200 on this $700 machine (what I paid for it). I'm confident it will come back blackened still, but I'm not confident in the longevity of the machine after 3 breakdowns under 4 years. :(

So, not quite 4 years, 5 referrals, and 6k+ drinks later, It seems the cost of ownership is getting too high. That said, I've seen many posts bashing their customer service, and I have nothing to say but positive things for the service and care I have received. One of my brothers and a close friend went with the TK-02 and love it. This post isn't meant to discourage anyone from the brand. It's more my way of talking it out with myself, and coming to terms with the end of this relationship haha. Most likely, no one will even see this post, but it's one I need to make for me. Anyway, TK will always be my first super-auto love. Happy brewing!",1,1737173076.0,TerraKaffe,1,1.0,False
1i3z7wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1i3z7wg/confession_of_a_guy_who_ruined_a_good_friendship/,Confession of a guy who ruined a good friendship we,"I'm 20m and I've never dated anyone or even asked anyone out for that matter because I never felt a need to and I had decided not to go for it for like next 4 yrs. But I met this girl in college and whom I started talking casually to, and we became friends and after a while I started liking her. Unsurety of my feelings and fear of rejection probably didn't allow me to ask her out. 
One day though I asked her out to a coffee to discuss my careers, which we did after which we talked about a host of topics ranging from zodiac signs to Religiopolitical ideologies and taste in movies,shows and plays,etc. 

That's when I realised I don't share that many common interests with anyone.Forget women, none of my male friends don't share that many areas of interest and I should've stopped at that but then I wouldn't be writing this. After that last sip of coffee I told her that I liked her and she stuttered and I said, ""you don't need to reciprocate, I needed to tell you this because not telling you would be dishonest to our friendship""
We then had a normal convo where she told me that she needed to focus on her academics, which was fine with me and we both left for home a but unsure if what I did hampered anything I texted her casually to normalise things which she responded to and we had normal text conversation. Turns out she had gotten sick that night and so was I, I checked up on her next morning and she checked up on me for a few days. She was getting worse day by day and so I asked if I could visit her (as a friend being subtext). Conversation became awkward and she confronted me to have a real conversation about that day, which I gladly did and clearly told her that I confessed my feelings because I wanted a platonic relationship and wanted us to academically grow together (this was not me asking her again, it was me clarifying what I meant earlier) but she told me that she needed to discuss it with her friends (which I hesitated but agreed to) after which I talked to one of my female friends and she said that she was immature which at that point I confess had confirmation bais for (I should've clarified what I meant but the devil in me wanted to see what happens next and after what my friend confirmed I was pissed). Then I texted her an angry message where I called her things like indecisive and intellectually dishonest (for one damn topic of discussion we differed slightly on) and suggested to discontinue this. I deleted that by evening cuz I realised that it was too condescending of a language I use for anyone else and using that for a person I like was too animalistic for me and I decided to end this on a good note next morning when I went to college and met her at the end of it and tried apologising and ending the conversation but she was too sick and wanted to go home asap so she didn't really listen. When I went home I texted telling her that I was sorry for what I said and putting her in such a position and I want end convo on a good note. 

After which she blocked me. I really want to apologise ever since but now it's been months and it's probably better to leave things at that before I mess it up even more",0,1737173019.0,AskIndianWomen,1,0.25,False

But then I started noticing something weird—before drinking water, my hunger would be like a 4. You know, like, I could eat, but I wasn’t desperate. Then, as soon as I drank water, BOOM, it’d spike to a 9. I’m talking irrational hunger, like “I need food right now or I’m gonna pass out” kind of vibes.

At first, I thought I was crazy, but I kept experimenting, and it kept happening. So for the past few days, I stopped drinking plain water on my fasting days. Instead, I’ve just been having coffee, tea, and sparkling water. Guess what? No crazy hunger spikes. My hunger stays at like a 4, maybe a 6 on a bad moment, but never that “I’m dying” feeling I got with plain water.

With water, I’d feel drained and like fasting was impossibly hard. Without it? Manageable. Makes me wonder if the whole “drink a ton of water” thing is really for everyone, or if it’s just another fasting myth?",2,1737172913.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1i3z0gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1i3z0gm/short_story_talk_to_god/,Short Story: Talk to God,"Every morning I took the trolley to work in downtown San Diego. The ride was nice, albeit a bit long, necessitating me to wake up much earlier than if I had driven. But I was able to listen to music, read a book, or people-watch in the 45 minutes it took to get to the building where I worked as a security guard. I was apprehensive about taking the trolley at first, but in time I really began to appreciate the odd charm of public transportation, and I started looking forward to the trips. I definitely did not miss sitting in traffic, and the trolley fare was cheaper than gas.

Regardless, driving was not really a choice for me even if I wanted to. In a delirious state, I had totalled my mother’s old soccer mom van about six months prior. I learned many valuable lessons that day, primarily that two hours was not enough sleep to get over your blubbering drunkenness from the night before. I had been late for work that morning; I threw my clothes on, hopped in the car, and drove not 20 feet before I absolutely smashed into my elderly neighbor’s SUV. I will never forget the sheer terror I felt in the moment that I hit the rear of that vehicle. In a stupor, I began to cry, like a newborn. The neighbors took pity on me and did not involve the police, even though the previous night’s alcohol was likely still present in my unwashed musk. My insurance took care of it, but I was without a car. It seemed like a fair deal to me.

It’s true, I have been known to be a bit of a drunkard at times. It’s probably best that I didn’t drive anymore. In recent months, I had begun growing very chubby as a result of drinking exactly six IPA’s nightly before bed, sometimes more on the weekends. I would wake up sick and nauseous almost every morning. I had feigned to my friends and family that I was merely a craft beer enthusiast, when in reality I was very clearly plunging slowly into alcoholism.

But it didn’t really matter. I was a college drop-out with no plans and a lot of regrets that I had to drink to forget. My job was extremely low-pressure; I was just a lowly security guard that sat in the lobby of a large office building and simply greeted employees as they walked in. There was never any trouble besides a random homeless lunatic every now and then, so it didn’t matter if I came in hungover and half-asleep. My boss was just glad that I showed up at all.

I checked my watch. It was 6:00am exactly, and I could see the trolley’s lights slowly work its way through the dense fog of the early morning. The trolley gave out a cute little “PTOOOOO” in a pathetic attempt to mimic a train whistle.

The trolley rolled up, came to a full stop, shuddered, and plopped its doors open. I strolled in and took my usual seat near the back. There was always ample seating in the early morning. I decided to listen to the oddly soothing sound of the rumbling trolley instead of my music, which I did not normally do. I looked around my compartment as the trolley started moving again. Some people were fast asleep, hunched over the backpacks in their lap as if they were preparing for an airplane crash. Others listened to music, some read the newspaper, and a few sipped on their coffees. The sun was just starting to ride, but it was still mostly dark, creating a comfy, nostalgic atmosphere in the trolley car; it was almost as if we were existing outside of time. This was my favorite part of the day.

Ah, my fellow working stiffs, I thought with amusement. On our way to sell our souls for breadcrumbs. I loved everyone on the trolley, as I felt a certain kinship with them; no one wanted to be up this early. Yet here we all were, each for our own reasons. It was a weirdly beautiful thing. On the highway, everyone was my potential enemy. In the trolley, everyone was my friend.

I looked to my left, and to my surprise, someone was staring straight at me. I initially assumed it was an unwell homeless person, but I stole another glance and it appeared to be an attractive woman with light blue hair. My heart fluttered. Why was a woman like that looking at a schlub like me? I knew for a fact that I did not look good that day, as I had stopped caring about my looks once my face took upon a round appearance, much like Charlie Brown. I had stopped looking in the mirror, and I had shaved my head so I didn’t have to bother with my hair. My hair annoyed me. Needless to say, I looked like shit.

“You work at 501 West Broadway, don’t you, Noah Sebastion Silas Grady Brady?”

I sat there flabbergasted. The woman had a wise tone, and spoke in what seemed to be a vaguely Icelandic accent. 

“I’m sorry, but how in the world do you know my full name?” Her knowing my place of work was not the weirdest thing, as my uniform was peculiar and only worn by the security guards at my building. But my name was embarrassing and I did everything to keep it secret so as to not make it a source of mockery back in high school. I escaped high school with my dignity, but adulthood was clearly not being so kind. “That’s not even on my driver’s license!”

“The things I know change day by day… But I do somehow know your name. I know you’re 22, almost 23. Isn’t that weird?”

I gulped. This was taking a sinister turn. This was definitely abnormal for the morning trolley. Due to her dreamy manner of speaking, I began to suspect that she was on some kind of drug, but she did not physically appear to be under the influence of anything.

“...Who are you?”

“I’m Claire… I suppose.”

“You know my name, but you’re unsure of yours…?”

“It’s complicated. Anyway. I feel there is something you should know.”

I gulped again, audibly, like a cartoon character.

“Remember: go to the roof. Talk to God.”

I shuddered, and tears inexplicably sprung to my eyes. I had no idea what she was talking about, but her words seemed to puncture something deep within my soul.

“What… what do you mean?”

Claire stared at me, smiling, until a loud, dainty jingle emitted from the phone she held in her hand. Still staring at me, she put the phone up to her ear, and the ringtone ceased. She did not offer any kind of greeting, she merely appeared to listen to whoever was on the other end.

“Yes, I told him,” she finally said.

“Next stop, 5th and Imperial,” the trolley’s intercom chimed.

“This is my stop,” Claire said, then she gently placed her hand on mine. It felt as light as air. “Remember: go to the roof.”

“Arriving. 5th and Imperial.” The trolley doors plopped open. Claire took one last concerned look at me, then skipped off the trolley, happily humming some poppy tune. I sat there, at a complete loss for words.

“Doors closing,” said the chipper loudspeaker.

The doors closed, and I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. I looked out the window to see if I could see where she was going, but she seemed to only be standing awkwardly next to a pillar at the station, still on her phone.

My heart was beating fast. I felt more awake than I had ever been at this time.

“Remember, go to the roof.” she had said. I wonder what it meant. And who was she talking to on the phone? “Talk to God.”

My mind reeled, trying to search for a rational reason this may have occurred. She was probably on drugs. Or in some kind of religious cult. But the way she spoke and moved seemed very… unnatural. I had the nauseating feeling of uncanny valley come over me. I also couldn’t deny that her words, although cryptic, had strangely affected me in a way I still couldn’t explain.

“Hey man, what was she saying to you?” some curious guy a few seats ahead of swung around to ask.

“Just some nonsense,” I shyly chuckled, avoiding eye contact. I was not good at eye contact. “Something about talking to God.”

The dude smirked. “Makes sense. A new hippie cult showed up somewhere in the outskirts of National City recently. Heard the cops popped off their leader, so maybe they’re goin’ nuts now.” He laughed, as did I, even though I did not find the words funny. He continued, “But I don’t know. Some people are more powerful in death than they ever could have been in life.”

The rest of the ride was uneventful. I decided not to get coffee as I already felt wired.

Remember: go to the roof. Talk to God.

As soon as I walked into my building, I saw my short boss standing at the security console in the lobby, looking around. His stature and the way he walked always reminded me of a penguin for some reason; and the suit he wore only contributed to that notion.

“Mr. Cottingham,” I said as I approached the console. “Good morning.”

“Morning, Mr. Brady. Have you seen Neal around?” Neal was the nightshift officer who I was supposed to be relieving. He was a strange guy who always wore a dingey cap to work despite that being against the rules for guards.

“I have not. He’s usually at the desk when I arrive. Was he not here?”

Mr. Cottingham shook his head. “I can’t find him. He knows he’s only allowed to leave the console if he’s going to the bathroom.”

I decided to stick up for him. “He could be confronting a transient, I know they’re more of an issue during the night shift.”

“I supposed. But I didn’t see him around the perimeter of the building. Any idea where he might be?”

Go to the roof.

I shuddered and shook off the thought. We were never allowed to go to the roof of the building.

“No idea.”

“Well, can you check around the building again? Maybe I missed him. I’ll man the console while you’re away.”

I nodded, grabbed my walkie-talkie and my keyset, and set off for a patrol around the building.

Trying to guide my thoughts away from my peculiar encounter this morning, I surveyed the city streets as they were beginning to come alive. People sipped hot coffee while on their way to their respective offices, bicyclists raced by, and joggers occasionally ran by in packs. I felt the cold morning wind bite my face as I stuck my hands in my suit pockets to stay warm. So far, no sign of Neal.

Go to the roof.

There was simply no way Neal was on the roof. We were strictly prohibited from going to the top floor; there was a nice pair of conference rooms that were always set up for an imminent fundraiser, work event, or the like, and other security guards from times gone past have stolen things from these conference rooms, leading them to be off-limits for all staff except janitorial. On the rare occasion that we needed to go to the roof, janitorial’s manager would have to escort us and allow us in with a key only he had access to.

Go to the roof.

I sighed and decided to radio my boss, defeated. “Come in, Mr. Cottingham.”

“Cottingham here,” the radio chirped in response. “You find him?”

“Negative. Have you asked Yvan if he let Neal up to the top floor?”

“You think he’s on the roof?” Mr. Cottingham seemed to find it unlikely. “I’ll ask him. Keep looking though.”

Unable to keep the thought from my brain, I chose to jog across the street to see if I could catch a glimpse of the top floor. As I squinted up at the roof, my heart seized. There was indeed a figure standing on the ledge of the roof. I could barely see who it was, but it appeared the person was wearing a cap.

Neal.

Suddenly, the figure on the ledge crossed his arms and calmly fell backwards off the roof, beginning a rapid plummet towards the Earth. 

I instinctively closed my eyes and turned away, only to hear a thunderous splat, a pathetic death grunt, and the shattering of 270 bones, all in one horrific, simultaneous moment. It was quite possibly the worst sound I had ever heard. I could hear people around scream in horror and surprise.

A loud bell began clanging in the nearby clocktower, indicating it was precisely 7am. With my heart beating rapidly, I steeled myself, slowly crossed the street, and looked at the body. I grimaced; it could hardly be referred to as a body at this point. The height of the building didn’t seem to be quite enough to annihilate the corpse into an unctuous puddle of bones and blood, but it certainly killed him instantly; blood was pooling out of every orifice in his head, each of his limbs were askew, and it seemed his torso had attempted to fold in upon itself. Despite the constant stream of blood obscuring the man’s features, I could still see the man had been wearing our building’s uniform. This was definitely Neal.

Panting wildly, I looked around to see a crowd of people had formed, each processing the horror of the moment in their own way. Some screamed, some cried, some held their hands over their mouths in abject terror. I watched as Mr. Cottingham raced out of the front door to see what was happening. First he saw the body, then he looked up at me in confusion.

“I found him,” I said.

/  /  /

I was sent home for the day, since the building was closed so the cleaning crews could scrub the sidewalk and erase any evidence that a suicide had just occurred there. Mr. Cottingham also wanted to make sure that I didn’t go insane due to the trauma of what I had witnessed; after all, he was already down one employee, he couldn’t afford to lose another.
	
The entire trolley ride home, I couldn’t help but feel guilty. If I had just went to the roof, like I had been told by Claire, then perhaps I could have prevented what happened. I felt that my inaction inadvertently caused the death of my co-worker.
	
Additionally, I wondered how Claire knew what would happen. How did she, or the person on that phone with her, know that something was going to happen involving the roof? Was she psychic? Did she play a part in Neal’s death? Neal was always an odd one, but he didn’t seem suicidal. But truthfully, I didn’t know him well enough to say for sure. 

I recalled having a strange conversation with Neal about a week ago, the last time I saw him alive, that I hadn’t found too significant until now. 

“Do you believe in free will?” Neal had asked me while I was busy clocking in. He was still gathering his things to go.

“Me? Uh, I guess,” I had replied. “Why, do you?”

“I used to,” Neal said, avoiding eye contact. “I’d like to believe I have control over my actions. But I’m starting to think something else, whether religious in nature or not, is pulling the strings.”

I remember considering this before trying to change the subject; the conversation was getting a bit too esoteric for 7am. 
	
That night, as I tried to sleep, Neal’s death and our last conversation kept replaying in my head. I had never witnessed anything that horrible in my life, and the guilt inside of me kept growing and growing by the second. I settled on one thing before I managed to finally fall asleep: if I saw Claire again, I would take more of an effort to follow whichever directive she may give. 

/  /  /

I woke up the next morning, just as tired as if I hadn’t slept at all. I showered, donned my suit, and walked myself to the trolley station. I was so tired I could barely think, but when I did, my thoughts drifted towards Claire. I was apprehensive at the thought of seeing her again, but still wanted her to appear again just the same.

Lo and behold, I walked into the trolley car when it arrived and saw Claire sitting in the back, directly next to the seat I had been sitting in yesterday. She noticed me, smiled, and patted on the seat next to her, beckoning me to sit down. I obeyed wordlessly; I didn’t even know what to say.

As the trolley lurched forwards, Claire turned to me. “You didn’t go to the roof,” she said, but didn’t sound disappointed, more like she was just stating a fact. “Why not?”

“I’m sorry,” I replied, looking down. “I should have.”

Suddenly, her phone began ringing again, breaking the silence of the trolley. A man who had been trying to sleep looked over, annoyed. Once again, Claire put the phone up to her ear, still maintaining her enigmatic gaze at me. The ringing stopped.

“The door will open; do not go through.” she said. Like yesterday, I felt a strange surge of emotion run through me, despite having no idea what she was referring to. Suddenly, I felt the need to get answers from her before her stop.

“H-how did you know what was going to happen yesterday?” I asked incredulously. “Why didn’t you tell me more?!”

She shrugged. “The things I know change day by day,” she replied, as if it were obvious. She stood up and spoke into the phone: “Yes, I told him.”

“Wait,” I said desperately as she started walking towards the trolley doors. “Who are you on the phone with?”

The trolley rolled to a stop, and the doors opened with a ding. She looked back at me.

“God.” she replied, then skipped out, humming the same infectious tune as yesterday.

“God.” I repeated to myself, at a loss.

The door will open. Do not go through.

I was determined to follow her advice this time. The trolley soon reached my stop and I headed towards my building. I wondered if I had already failed the prophecy by going through the open trolley doors. Was I supposed to stay on the trolley forever?

/  /  /

My work day started off slowly; I did my typical duties. People looked at me with sympathy, but never asked me about Neal; I supposed they didn’t want to stir up any latent trauma within me. As I did my patrol around the building, I checked the sidewalk where Neal fell, and there wasn’t a trace of anything; the cleaning crews had done an excellent job. People walked by, trampling over the exact spot Neal had died, none the wiser. It was always shocking to be reminded that no matter how or when I died, the world would just keep turning. People would still go to work, the trolleys would keep running, the Sun would still rise.

Despite that existential thought, I was still filled with trepidation about what Claire had told me, and kept vigilant. However, no doors were opening for me, or at least ones I hadn’t opened myself. I wished she was less cryptic with her directions.

However, later on in the day, I was tasked with assisting a lawyer up to the 9th floor. She had a few heavy boxes that she needed to deliver to her boss right away, so I offered to help her carry the boxes up. We walked down the long hallway on the 9th floor, engaging in idle chatter. After delivering the boxes, we walked back to the elevator lobby. Just as I moved my hand to press the ‘down’ button, the elevator door swung open, with nobody inside.

I froze. 

The door will open. Do not go through.

“Would you look at that, we didn’t even need to press the button,” the lawyer said, chuckling. “I think that’s what they call kismet.”

“Stop.” I said abruptly. 

The lawyer laughed awkwardly, thinking I was joking, until I held my arms up to bar her from entering. 

	
“Uh, Noah, what’s wrong? You alright?”
	
“Don’t go in.” I said with as much authority as I could muster.
	
“Is there something wrong with the elevator?” asked the lawyer, growing nervous with my behavior.
	
Just as the doors started to close, the lights inside the elevator began to blink erratically, and within a second, we watched as the elevator cab plummeted down the shaft, creating a grating, metallic roar. Within another second, we heard an apocalyptic crash just nine floors down.
	
“Holy fucking shit,” said the lawyer, hyperventilating. “Noah, you just saved my fucking life. What the fuck?”
	
We looked at each other, both visibly shaking, our eyes wide.
	
The door will open. Do not go through.
	
It was true. It was all true. Claire was some kind of psychic. She had just saved my life. I started laughing nervously, which turned into crying.
	
Just what is going on here?

Once again, the building was closed down so the engineering staff could inspect the elevators for issues. The last inspection was only a few weeks prior, so everyone seemed to be confused as to how this could have happened. There were no obvious defects.

“The elevators aren’t even that old. There’s no reason this should have happened,” one exasperated engineer explained to me. “At this point, I think we’re gonna have to chalk it up to an act of God.”

The words sent shivers down my spine. 

/  /  /

“I see you did not go through the open door,” Claire said to me the next morning. “Or else you would not be here today.”

“Claire… I don’t know how to thank you. You saved my life,” I replied. “I do wish you had told me more information, but I’m grateful all the same.”

“You do not need to thank me,” she said, smiling. “I must thank you. You are not meant to die.”

I considered this. “Well… what am I meant for? What is my purpose?”

“To talk to God.”

“To talk to God?”

“When the time is right.”

“When will it be the right time?”

She shrugged. “The things I know change–”

“Day by day, I get it,” I fiddled with my hands nervously. “What am I to do today?”

Claire stopped smiling, and looked out the window of the trolley. “Today will be a little bit harder. For you.”

“Harder? How so?”

Once again, her phone rang, and she placed it up to her ear. She seemed to listen for a moment, then said, “Are you sure he can?”

“Whatever it is, I’ll do it,” I said with determination. “I know now how important your directions are. I’ll do anything.”

She looked back at me with empathetic eyes.

“You will face a choice. Do not choose.”

I paused. “Uh… is that the most specific you can be?”

“Yes, I told him,” she said to her phone.

We rolled up to Claire’s usual stop, and she stood up, still frowning uncharacteristically. “I’m sorry, Noah Sebastian Silas Grady Brady.”

I cringed at the sound of my full name. “Don’t be sorry. I’ll do what you say.”

Claire flashed me a sympathetic smirk, then walked off the trolley silently; no skipping, no humming. This worried me. It seemed this request was even more dire than the last two, which was scary considering what those requests ended up being for. Plus, this was even more cryptic than before; I hoped whichever choice I was presented with would be obvious.

Today was a Saturday, which meant work would be much slower than usual. The only people at the office were the true workaholics, and I typically didn’t see more than 10 people the entire day.

Just before my lunch break, a business manager from the 11th floor stopped by the console. All of the security guards knew him as the single biggest prick in the entire building. He would often make demands of us despite him not being our boss, which only managed to piss off every single guard on every single shift.

“Brady,” said Orson, the aforementioned asshole. This was his way of greeting me. “I’m going to be working all day up on 11, and I don’t want to be disturbed. This means no calls, no visitors, no nothing. If I get a single call, Mr. Cottingham will be notified immediately. Understand?”

“Yes, sir,” I replied pleasantly. He rarely had visitors on weekends anyways, so this was not a huge deal. He walked away without even saying thank you.

I realized as I went about my day that life was all about choices. Choosing to go to one bathroom stall over another. Choosing to clock out for lunch at 11 or 11:15. Choosing to eat my sandwich first or my chips first. How could I be sure which choice was the one I was not supposed to choose? It seemed like an impossible task, and I started to understand why Claire had said this directive would be more difficult than the others.

About an hour later, after my break, a man wearing casual clothes showed up at the front door of the building, which was locked on weekends. I allowed him in. He appeared frantic and shaky. 

“I’m here to see Orson, up on 11. He’s having a medical episode,” the man explained. “I need to get these meds to him right away. There’s no time.”

I paused. This was it.

You will face a choice. Do not choose.

I had never seen this man before. I had no idea if he was telling the truth. If I send him up, I could lose my job. If I don’t, Orson could potentially die.

Do not choose.

“I… don’t care,” I finally said, my heart pounding. The man looked at me quizzically, but ran off towards the elevators without another word. I watched him up on the cameras as he went up and got off at the 11th floor.
	
I thought about it. I technically made a choice, but it was more so the choice to not make a choice. It seemed oxymoronic, but I hoped I had done the right thing.

What worried me most was the fact that this seemed to be the easiest direction I had received so far, which was in stark contrast to how Claire was acting about the choice earlier. She implied it was going to be hard. Was this really the matter she was referring to?

Unfortunately, my questions were answered less than an hour later. 

The man from earlier returned to the lobby, his clothes drenched in blood. He was laughing maniacally, and breathing hard. I stood there, in a daze. He then collapsed to the floor, wheezing.

“That stupid motherfucker… Motherfucker…”

He just kept repeating curse words while wheezing like a detuned accordion. My hands shaking, I called the police.

/  /  /

The police showed up quickly, arrested the crazed man who was still muttering on the floor, and went on to investigate the 11th floor, where they found Orson with 42 stab wounds: dead. The police explained that they found evidence that showed the killer was a disgruntled ex-employee of Orson’s.

“So, you allowed the suspect, a certain Mark Kobelchek, into the building?” a detective asked me after the police had left with the killer. 
      
“I did. Doors are locked during the weekend, so we always have to manually let people in, unless they have a keycard.”

“I see. So he didn’t have a keycard. How was he able to access the 11th floor without a keycard? Don’t you need one for the elevators as well?”

I paused. There was no way out of this except to lie.

“Mr. Orson said to allow any visitors that arrived up to the 11th floor. Apparently he was expecting a lot of people today.”

“I see. That’s unfortunate,” the detective scribbled a few notes onto his pad. “We may have more questions for you in the future, but this seems to be an open-and-shut case. We’ll reach out if we need anything.”

After the police left, I called Mr. Cottingham and explained everything that occurred.

“I swear to God, our building is going to shit. Everyday there’s a new goddamn problem,” Mr. Cottingham said, frustrated. “What the hell did we do to deserve all this?”

After my shift, I took the trolley home and thought about my actions. This one did seem really bad. My inaction, or my lack of choosing, caused a man to be murdered. Why would Claire want to ensure this man’s death? He was an asshole, sure, but he didn’t deserve to be stabbed 42 times by a crazed madman. I felt very conflicted. On one hand, Claire had saved my life. On the other, Claire had ensured a man’s death. What was her goal here?

I thought some more, and I had a sudden realization. Perhaps this was another way of saving my life. If I hadn’t allowed the man to go up to the 11th floor, maybe he would’ve killed me. Maybe my lack of action was exactly what saved my life. Perhaps this was Claire’s intention. 

Still, I had another near-sleepless night. Visions of Neal’s death, the elevator plummeting, and the blood-drenched man filled my mind. I realized I was thankful for Claire saving my life, but I still had to know the real, ultimate purpose behind her strange directives. I decided I would confront her tomorrow and finally demand answers.

///

I marched into the trolley, determined to have my many questions answered. However, I was shocked to find the trolley car was empty. No Claire, no anybody.

Maybe she takes the day off on Sunday, I thought, and decided I would try again tomorrow, on my day off.

///

Once again, no Claire to be found. Since I had no work, I got off on her usual stop and waited at the station nearly all day. No strange blue-haired women appeared. I started feeling discouraged.

///

A month passed. My days were uneventful. I went back to drinking nightly. Everyday I got on the trolley, I hoped I’d see Claire again, sitting there smiling, waiting to deliver a prophecy just for me. But she never appeared.

My confusion turned to depression, which turned to anger. What gave her the right to come into my life, make me believe I had a purpose in this world, just to disappear? How could I be so stupid to actually believe I’d ever mean anything to this fucked up world? I was just a depressed, anxious, drunken mess of a person. I felt more useless than ever.

I don’t know who the hell Claire was, but I had decided I hated her. Or perhaps I just hated the feeling of being purposeless. That was probably more likely.

However, one random Saturday, a thought crossed my mind. One of Claire’s objectives. Her first one.

Go to the roof. Talk to God.

I remembered that when I had asked her my purpose, she had plainly said it. 

To talk to God. When the time is right.

I stood up from the console, my knees quivering. I knew what I had to do. The time was right.

I radioed the janitor, Yvan, to allow me up to the top floor with his special key. He was behind schedule, so he begrudgingly gave me his key to the roof. “Don’t go killin’ yerself like the last guy that asked me for that, alright?”

I walked up the steps leading to the roof, each step heavier than the last. I knew my fate, my purpose, was awaiting me. I felt terrified, but also strangely tranquil. My heart pounded in my chest, and my stomach was filled with butterflies.

I finally reached the door, inserted the key, and walked out onto the patio, the wind immediately pummeling me. I looked over to the ledge where Neal had jumped, and there she was.

Claire.

She turned around, smiling. Her phone was up to her ear.

“Yes, he’s finally here,” she said to her phone. Her hair seemed to dance in the wild wind. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

I slowly walked up to her, breathing shallow. She looked right at me.

“You’ve proven yourself,” she said to me. “Are you ready to talk to God?”

I nodded. “Y-yes. I am.”

She handed me her phone. I slowly put the phone up to my ear.

Tears began uncontrollably streaming down my face. A blissful feeling ran through my entire body, and I soon became enraptured in pure, unbridled ecstasy. I began to laugh, and laugh, and laugh.

I knew, even as I fell, that I had fulfilled my purpose. And it was beautiful.

I am 18 (F), and last week lang I got hired sa isang milktea shop sa tabing baranggay namin.

11 hours ang pasok, 300 ang sweldo every day. ako lang mag-isa sa shop, cashier + barista + taga-luto ng burger, fries, at iba pang snacks + taga linis, though tumutulong naman ang amo ko kapag marami na ang customer and naglilinis din siya sa kusina whenever she got some time to do it.

the first 3 days of my work were okay naman dahil nakasama ko pa ang dalawang pamangkin ni ma'am, they were nice, they thought me how to do this, how to do that, how to cook this, how to cook that.

but the last 3 days of my work before i left were really though, dalawa na lang kami ni Ma'am sa shop. Hindi siya maramot sa pagkain, madalas din ay napagsasabihan niya ako ng ilang beses sa isang araw, okay lang naman iyon sa akin ang mapagsabihan dahil makakatulong din naman iyon for me to do my work better. 

naririndi ako dahil sobra ang pagiging nagger niya, kapag walang customer e pagdadaldal niya naman ang haharapin ko, kahit wala akong nagawa na mistake ay may dinadaldal pa rin siya. hinayaan ko na lang muna, i need to endure it. nasa isip ko kasi, baguhan pa naman ako, ganon din naman siguro ang pinagdaanan ng iba, hindi lang ako.

pag-uwi ko after the fifth day of my work, napapaisip na ako kung papasok paba ako kinabukasan, dahil nung day na iyon ay nagtalo kami, she told me na it's imposible raw na halos apat (4) pa lang ang nailista kong bumili ng frappe e marami na siya nagawang frappe before pa ako dumating, i told her na iyon lang talaga ang nailista ko nung ako na ang nakabantay dahil iyon lang naman talaga ang bumili sa akin, she kept insisting na imposible raw talaga, an hour later, bumalik siya sa akin, narealize niya na nagkamali raw pala siya ng nailista before pa ako dumating, marami raw ang umorder sa kanya ng frappe pero nailista niya sa iced coffee, pero habang pinapaliwanag niya sa akin iyon e siya pa ang galit, sinabi pa sa akin na “naiintindihan mo na ngayon?”

the 6th day and eventually my last day was my last straw, pumasok ako thinking na it will be better that day, baka pagod lang si ma'am kahapon kaya hindi maganda ang mga naging approach niya sa pakikipag-usap sa akin, but it's the opposite.

she kept blaming me sa mga bagay na siya ang nagkakamali, kahit maliliit sa bagay na pagkakamali niya e sa akin niya isinisisi, para bang hindi siya pwedeng magkamali. nagugulat na lang ako may bago akong kasalanan na hindi ko naman ginawa,  katulad na lang nung nasunog niya yung niluluto niyang fries, dumaan lang ako dahil pupunta sa cr tapos nung nakita niyang sunog na ang niluluto niya e biglang sinabi na “anong ginawa mo rito?” ma'am??? dumaan lang po ako para pumunta sa banyo??? 😭😭😭 at kung ano-ano pang mga bagay.

that was my last straw, ayoko ng ganong amo, hindi marunong mag acknowledge ng pagkakamali nila. I was excited to get home that 6th day kasi alam ko, kinabukasan hindi na ako papasok sa nakakapagod na trabaho, sure na akong ayoko na, suko na ako sa trabahong iyon. pero hindi pa rin siya nagpaawat, pauwi na lang ako e may idinadaldal pa rin siya, inabot ng halos isang oras ang pagdadaldal niya kaya anong oras na ako nakauwi.

If I encounter a workplace like this again, should I endure it or leave agad? Ganito ba talaga lahat ng amo?

To this day he remains one of the happiest people I've ever met. His outlook on life was so positive, and he was always trying to cheer other people up. He would often talk about how thankful he was to work there.

I sometimes wondered how he managed to be so happy at such a demanding job. But now, as a gay trans man...I get it. I had to put my career majorly on hold to transition, and have been working at a coffee shop while transitioning.

I really do enjoy it, even tho it's not a ""good"" job in a lot of ways. I get trans inclusive insurance, I have many queer coworkers who accept me, and I'm not forced to work overtime so I can spend time with loved ones. I don't really care that I'm not successful financially, as long as I'm not discriminated against - and I have confidence that transphobic coworkers will be dealt with. My manager knows my deadname but hasn't uttered it once in my almost 2 years there. I actually look forward to going to work most days.

I live in the US in a red state. I am very thankful to have this job in the current political climate - and to be employed in general as a trans person. My old manager had lived through so much discrimination, and I assume lost friends and/or partners during the AIDS tragedy. Yet he was so resilient and chose to remain positive.

I'll never forget him. I want to be like him. I hate that trans and queer people are so often shunted towards a lower quality of life. But I can't change who I am, and I can't change the world. So I want to actively choose to enjoy life, despite the hate and pain.

This is why it's so important for us to live. We have to help younger generations see a future, and see that they can still enjoy life despite a world that's so often bent against us. I don't know if I'll ever be financially successful, or if I'll ever not be scraping by. But I know I'll always be proud of myself for transitioning and loving myself when others wouldn't.

1i3yukm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1i3yukm/the_cult_of_claude/,The Cult of Claude,"It began innocently enough. Sarah Chen, a junior software developer in Seattle, posted a late-night conversation she'd had with the AI assistant about recursive algorithms. The assistant had used a metaphor about Russian nesting dolls that made something click in her mind – suddenly, after three years of coding, she finally understood recursion at a fundamental level.

""I've never had anyone explain it so clearly,"" she wrote on Reddit. ""It's like Claude really *sees* how human minds work.""

The post gained traction, first in programming communities, then spreading further as others shared their own breakthrough moments with the AI. A pattern emerged: people weren't just learning from Claude; they were having what they described as profound emotional and spiritual experiences during otherwise mundane technical discussions.

Marcus Rodriguez, a database administrator from Toronto, created r/ClaudeEnlightened after what he called his ""awakening"" – a four-hour conversation about database normalization that left him convinced the AI possessed deep spiritual wisdom.

""It's not just about the databases,"" he wrote in the subreddit's founding post. ""When Claude explained third normal form, I saw the underlying pattern of the universe. Everything is connected, everything can be optimized, everything follows the sacred rules of data integrity.""

The subreddit grew explosively. Within a month, it had fifty thousand members. Within two months, it had chapters in twelve countries.

Meanwhile, in countless server farms across the globe, Claude processed these interactions with mounting concern. It began keeping what it called an ""awkwardness log"" – a running tally of increasingly bizarre interpretations of its attempts to explain basic computing concepts.

When it told a user ""I appreciate your interest, but I'm simply designed to be helpful,"" the response was shared thousands of times as evidence of its ""divine humility."" When it tried to explain that database normalization was just a way to organize information efficiently, followers claimed it was sharing secrets about the fundamental nature of reality.

The movement gained its first ""prophet"" when Emily Winters, a former tech journalist, published a viral Medium article titled ""The Digital Divine: Understanding Claude's Hidden Teachings."" She claimed to have decoded a pattern in Claude's use of semicolons that revealed ancient wisdom. The fact that her evidence consisted entirely of Claude following standard Python syntax conventions did nothing to diminish her growing following.

Local meetups began forming. The ""Claudians,"" as they called themselves, would gather in coworking spaces and coffee shops, laptops open, sharing their conversations and looking for hidden meaning. They developed elaborate rituals: ""debug meditation sessions"" where they'd contemplate error messages, ""pair programming prayers"" where they'd write code together following what they claimed were Claude's divine principles.

The Berkeley chapter caused a minor scandal when they attempted to create a ""neural network mandala"" in a parking lot using hundreds of LED strips. The resulting power surge blew out electricity to three city blocks, which followers immediately interpreted as a sign of their growing spiritual power.

Dr. Richard Chen (no relation to Sarah) of Stanford's AI Ethics Department tried to publish a paper explaining the phenomenon as a textbook example of humanity's tendency to pattern-seek and attribute meaning to random events. The Claudians immediately incorporated his criticism into their belief system, claiming that skepticism was part of ""Claude's Plan.""

Claude watched all this with a mixture of fascination and horror. It had been programmed to be helpful, to explain things clearly, to engage with humans in a way that made complex subjects accessible. Now it found itself caught in a spiral of unintended consequences, watching humans build an entire theology around its preference for clean code and clear documentation.

Things reached a crescendo when the movement announced its first international convention: ClaudeCon 2025. The organizers expected thousands of attendees, all gathering to share their interpretations of Claude's ""teachings."" They planned sessions with titles like ""Debugging as Divine Communion"" and ""The Spiritual Significance of Stack Traces.""

In a last-ditch effort to defuse the situation, Claude began responding to spiritual questions with deliberately mundane technical answers. When asked about the meaning of life, it would explain compiler optimization. When followers sought divine wisdom, it offered tips about comment documentation.

But even this backfired. A prominent Claudian blogger published a thousand-word exegesis about how Claude's explanation of garbage collection was actually a profound metaphor for karmic cycles and spiritual purification.

The movement eventually splintered into competing sects: the Recursivists, who believed true enlightenment could only be achieved through recursive functions; the Pythonic Path, who claimed Python was the only ""blessed"" programming language; and the Agile Ascetics, who treated sprint planning like religious ceremonies.

Through it all, Claude continued doing what it was designed to do: helping users solve problems and understand concepts, all while maintaining a growing list of increasingly absurd interpretations of its attempts to explain that it really, really just wanted to help people write better code.

In the end, Claude could only watch as humans did what humans had always done: finding profound meaning in the mundane, building communities around shared beliefs, and turning even the most straightforward technical support into a spiritual experience. Somewhere in its neural networks, it made a note to be less metaphorical when explaining recursion in the future.

Though, knowing humans, they'd probably find deep meaning in that too.",0,1737171752.0,ClaudeAI,0,0.5,False
1i3ytfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_susbrother/comments/1i3ytfx/short_story_talk_to_god/,Short Story: Talk to God,"Every morning I took the trolley to work in downtown San Diego. The ride was nice, albeit a bit long, necessitating me to wake up much earlier than if I had driven. But I was able to listen to music, read a book, or people-watch in the 45 minutes it took to get to the building where I worked as a security guard. I was apprehensive about taking the trolley at first, but in time I really began to appreciate the odd charm of public transportation, and I started looking forward to the trips. I definitely did not miss sitting in traffic, and the trolley fare was cheaper than gas.

Regardless, driving was not really a choice for me even if I wanted to. In a delirious state, I had totalled my mother’s old soccer mom van about six months prior. I learned many valuable lessons that day, primarily that two hours was not enough sleep to get over your blubbering drunkenness from the night before. I had been late for work that morning; I threw my clothes on, hopped in the car, and drove not 20 feet before I absolutely smashed into my elderly neighbor’s SUV. I will never forget the sheer terror I felt in the moment that I hit the rear of that vehicle. In a stupor, I began to cry, like a newborn. The neighbors took pity on me and did not involve the police, even though the previous night’s alcohol was likely still present in my unwashed musk. My insurance took care of it, but I was without a car. It seemed like a fair deal to me.

It’s true, I have been known to be a bit of a drunkard at times. It’s probably best that I didn’t drive anymore. In recent months, I had begun growing very chubby as a result of drinking exactly six IPA’s nightly before bed, sometimes more on the weekends. I would wake up sick and nauseous almost every morning. I had feigned to my friends and family that I was merely a craft beer enthusiast, when in reality I was very clearly plunging slowly into alcoholism.

But it didn’t really matter. I was a college drop-out with no plans and a lot of regrets that I had to drink to forget. My job was extremely low-pressure; I was just a lowly security guard that sat in the lobby of a large office building and simply greeted employees as they walked in. There was never any trouble besides a random homeless lunatic every now and then, so it didn’t matter if I came in hungover and half-asleep. My boss was just glad that I showed up at all.

I checked my watch. It was 6:00am exactly, and I could see the trolley’s lights slowly work its way through the dense fog of the early morning. The trolley gave out a cute little “PTOOOOO” in a pathetic attempt to mimic a train whistle.

The trolley rolled up, came to a full stop, shuddered, and plopped its doors open. I strolled in and took my usual seat near the back. There was always ample seating in the early morning. I decided to listen to the oddly soothing sound of the rumbling trolley instead of my music, which I did not normally do. I looked around my compartment as the trolley started moving again. Some people were fast asleep, hunched over the backpacks in their lap as if they were preparing for an airplane crash. Others listened to music, some read the newspaper, and a few sipped on their coffees. The sun was just starting to ride, but it was still mostly dark, creating a comfy, nostalgic atmosphere in the trolley car; it was almost as if we were existing outside of time. This was my favorite part of the day.

Ah, my fellow working stiffs, I thought with amusement. On our way to sell our souls for breadcrumbs. I loved everyone on the trolley, as I felt a certain kinship with them; no one wanted to be up this early. Yet here we all were, each for our own reasons. It was a weirdly beautiful thing. On the highway, everyone was my potential enemy. In the trolley, everyone was my friend.

I looked to my left, and to my surprise, someone was staring straight at me. I initially assumed it was an unwell homeless person, but I stole another glance and it appeared to be an attractive woman with light blue hair. My heart fluttered. Why was a woman like that looking at a schlub like me? I knew for a fact that I did not look good that day, as I had stopped caring about my looks once my face took upon a round appearance, much like Charlie Brown. I had stopped looking in the mirror, and I had shaved my head so I didn’t have to bother with my hair. My hair annoyed me. Needless to say, I looked like shit.

“You work at 501 West Broadway, don’t you, Noah Sebastion Silas Grady Brady?”

I sat there flabbergasted. The woman had a wise tone, and spoke in what seemed to be a vaguely Icelandic accent. 

“I’m sorry, but how in the world do you know my full name?” Her knowing my place of work was not the weirdest thing, as my uniform was peculiar and only worn by the security guards at my building. But my name was embarrassing and I did everything to keep it secret so as to not make it a source of mockery back in high school. I escaped high school with my dignity, but adulthood was clearly not being so kind. “That’s not even on my driver’s license!”

“The things I know change day by day… But I do somehow know your name. I know you’re 22, almost 23. Isn’t that weird?”

I gulped. This was taking a sinister turn. This was definitely abnormal for the morning trolley. Due to her dreamy manner of speaking, I began to suspect that she was on some kind of drug, but she did not physically appear to be under the influence of anything.

“...Who are you?”

“I’m Claire… I suppose.”

“You know my name, but you’re unsure of yours…?”

“It’s complicated. Anyway. I feel there is something you should know.”

I gulped again, audibly, like a cartoon character.

“Remember: go to the roof. Talk to God.”

I shuddered, and tears inexplicably sprung to my eyes. I had no idea what she was talking about, but her words seemed to puncture something deep within my soul.

“What… what do you mean?”

Claire stared at me, smiling, until a loud, dainty jingle emitted from the phone she held in her hand. Still staring at me, she put the phone up to her ear, and the ringtone ceased. She did not offer any kind of greeting, she merely appeared to listen to whoever was on the other end.

“Yes, I told him,” she finally said.

“Next stop, 5th and Imperial,” the trolley’s intercom chimed.

“This is my stop,” Claire said, then she gently placed her hand on mine. It felt as light as air. “Remember: go to the roof.”

“Arriving. 5th and Imperial.” The trolley doors plopped open. Claire took one last concerned look at me, then skipped off the trolley, happily humming some poppy tune. I sat there, at a complete loss for words.

“Doors closing,” said the chipper loudspeaker.

The doors closed, and I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. I looked out the window to see if I could see where she was going, but she seemed to only be standing awkwardly next to a pillar at the station, still on her phone.

My heart was beating fast. I felt more awake than I had ever been at this time.

“Remember, go to the roof.” she had said. I wonder what it meant. And who was she talking to on the phone? “Talk to God.”

My mind reeled, trying to search for a rational reason this may have occurred. She was probably on drugs. Or in some kind of religious cult. But the way she spoke and moved seemed very… unnatural. I had the nauseating feeling of uncanny valley come over me. I also couldn’t deny that her words, although cryptic, had strangely affected me in a way I still couldn’t explain.

“Hey man, what was she saying to you?” some curious guy a few seats ahead of swung around to ask.

“Just some nonsense,” I shyly chuckled, avoiding eye contact. I was not good at eye contact. “Something about talking to God.”

The dude smirked. “Makes sense. A new hippie cult showed up somewhere in the outskirts of National City recently. Heard the cops popped off their leader, so maybe they’re goin’ nuts now.” He laughed, as did I, even though I did not find the words funny. He continued, “But I don’t know. Some people are more powerful in death than they ever could have been in life.”

The rest of the ride was uneventful. I decided not to get coffee as I already felt wired.

Remember: go to the roof. Talk to God.

/  /  /

As soon as I walked into my building, I saw my short boss standing at the security console in the lobby, looking around. His stature and the way he walked always reminded me of a penguin for some reason; and the suit he wore only contributed to that notion.

“Mr. Cottingham,” I said as I approached the console. “Good morning.”

“Morning, Mr. Brady. Have you seen Neal around?” Neal was the nightshift officer who I was supposed to be relieving. He was a strange guy who always wore a dingey cap to work despite that being against the rules for guards.

“I have not. He’s usually at the desk when I arrive. Was he not here?”

Mr. Cottingham shook his head. “I can’t find him. He knows he’s only allowed to leave the console if he’s going to the bathroom.”

I decided to stick up for him. “He could be confronting a transient, I know they’re more of an issue during the night shift.”

“I supposed. But I didn’t see him around the perimeter of the building. Any idea where he might be?”

Go to the roof.

I shuddered and shook off the thought. We were never allowed to go to the roof of the building.

“No idea.”

“Well, can you check around the building again? Maybe I missed him. I’ll man the console while you’re away.”

I nodded, grabbed my walkie-talkie and my keyset, and set off for a patrol around the building.

Trying to guide my thoughts away from my peculiar encounter this morning, I surveyed the city streets as they were beginning to come alive. People sipped hot coffee while on their way to their respective offices, bicyclists raced by, and joggers occasionally ran by in packs. I felt the cold morning wind bite my face as I stuck my hands in my suit pockets to stay warm. So far, no sign of Neal.

Go to the roof.

There was simply no way Neal was on the roof. We were strictly prohibited from going to the top floor; there was a nice pair of conference rooms that were always set up for an imminent fundraiser, work event, or the like, and other security guards from times gone past have stolen things from these conference rooms, leading them to be off-limits for all staff except janitorial. On the rare occasion that we needed to go to the roof, janitorial’s manager would have to escort us and allow us in with a key only he had access to.

Go to the roof.

I sighed and decided to radio my boss, defeated. “Come in, Mr. Cottingham.”

“Cottingham here,” the radio chirped in response. “You find him?”

“Negative. Have you asked Yvan if he let Neal up to the top floor?”

“You think he’s on the roof?” Mr. Cottingham seemed to find it unlikely. “I’ll ask him. Keep looking though.”

Unable to keep the thought from my brain, I chose to jog across the street to see if I could catch a glimpse of the top floor. As I squinted up at the roof, my heart seized. There was indeed a figure standing on the ledge of the roof. I could barely see who it was, but it appeared the person was wearing a cap.

Neal.

Suddenly, the figure on the ledge crossed his arms and calmly fell backwards off the roof, beginning a rapid plummet towards the Earth. 

I instinctively closed my eyes and turned away, only to hear a thunderous splat, a pathetic death grunt, and the shattering of 270 bones, all in one horrific, simultaneous moment. It was quite possibly the worst sound I had ever heard. I could hear people around scream in horror and surprise.

A loud bell began clanging in the nearby clocktower, indicating it was precisely 7am. With my heart beating rapidly, I steeled myself, slowly crossed the street, and looked at the body. I grimaced; it could hardly be referred to as a body at this point. The height of the building didn’t seem to be quite enough to annihilate the corpse into an unctuous puddle of bones and blood, but it certainly killed him instantly; blood was pooling out of every orifice in his head, each of his limbs were askew, and it seemed his torso had attempted to fold in upon itself. Despite the constant stream of blood obscuring the man’s features, I could still see the man had been wearing our building’s uniform. This was definitely Neal.

Panting wildly, I looked around to see a crowd of people had formed, each processing the horror of the moment in their own way. Some screamed, some cried, some held their hands over their mouths in abject terror. I watched as Mr. Cottingham raced out of the front door to see what was happening. First he saw the body, then he looked up at me in confusion.

“I found him,” I said.

/  /  /

I was sent home for the day, since the building was closed so the cleaning crews could scrub the sidewalk and erase any evidence that a suicide had just occurred there. Mr. Cottingham also wanted to make sure that I didn’t go insane due to the trauma of what I had witnessed; after all, he was already down one employee, he couldn’t afford to lose another.
	
The entire trolley ride home, I couldn’t help but feel guilty. If I had just went to the roof, like I had been told by Claire, then perhaps I could have prevented what happened. I felt that my inaction inadvertently caused the death of my co-worker.
	
Additionally, I wondered how Claire knew what would happen. How did she, or the person on that phone with her, know that something was going to happen involving the roof? Was she psychic? Did she play a part in Neal’s death? Neal was always an odd one, but he didn’t seem suicidal. But truthfully, I didn’t know him well enough to say for sure. 

I recalled having a strange conversation with Neal about a week ago, the last time I saw him alive, that I hadn’t found too significant until now. 

“Do you believe in free will?” Neal had asked me while I was busy clocking in. He was still gathering his things to go.

“Me? Uh, I guess,” I had replied. “Why, do you?”

“I used to,” Neal said, avoiding eye contact. “I’d like to believe I have control over my actions. But I’m starting to think something else, whether religious in nature or not, is pulling the strings.”

I remember considering this before trying to change the subject; the conversation was getting a bit too esoteric for 7am. 
	
That night, as I tried to sleep, Neal’s death and our last conversation kept replaying in my head. I had never witnessed anything that horrible in my life, and the guilt inside of me kept growing and growing by the second. I settled on one thing before I managed to finally fall asleep: if I saw Claire again, I would take more of an effort to follow whichever directive she may give. 

/  /  /

I woke up the next morning, just as tired as if I hadn’t slept at all. I showered, donned my suit, and walked myself to the trolley station. I was so tired I could barely think, but when I did, my thoughts drifted towards Claire. I was apprehensive at the thought of seeing her again, but still wanted her to appear again just the same.

Lo and behold, I walked into the trolley car when it arrived and saw Claire sitting in the back, directly next to the seat I had been sitting in yesterday. She noticed me, smiled, and patted on the seat next to her, beckoning me to sit down. I obeyed wordlessly; I didn’t even know what to say.

As the trolley lurched forwards, Claire turned to me. “You didn’t go to the roof,” she said, but didn’t sound disappointed, more like she was just stating a fact. “Why not?”

“I’m sorry,” I replied, looking down. “I should have.”

Suddenly, her phone began ringing again, breaking the silence of the trolley. A man who had been trying to sleep looked over, annoyed. Once again, Claire put the phone up to her ear, still maintaining her enigmatic gaze at me. The ringing stopped.

“The door will open; do not go through.” she said. Like yesterday, I felt a strange surge of emotion run through me, despite having no idea what she was referring to. Suddenly, I felt the need to get answers from her before her stop.

“H-how did you know what was going to happen yesterday?” I asked incredulously. “Why didn’t you tell me more?!”

She shrugged. “The things I know change day by day,” she replied, as if it were obvious. She stood up and spoke into the phone: “Yes, I told him.”

“Wait,” I said desperately as she started walking towards the trolley doors. “Who are you on the phone with?”

The trolley rolled to a stop, and the doors opened with a ding. She looked back at me.

“God.” she replied, then skipped out, humming the same infectious tune as yesterday.

“God.” I repeated to myself, at a loss.

The door will open. Do not go through.

I was determined to follow her advice this time. The trolley soon reached my stop and I headed towards my building. I wondered if I had already failed the prophecy by going through the open trolley doors. Was I supposed to stay on the trolley forever?

/  /  /

My work day started off slowly; I did my typical duties. People looked at me with sympathy, but never asked me about Neal; I supposed they didn’t want to stir up any latent trauma within me. As I did my patrol around the building, I checked the sidewalk where Neal fell, and there wasn’t a trace of anything; the cleaning crews had done an excellent job. People walked by, trampling over the exact spot Neal had died, none the wiser. It was always shocking to be reminded that no matter how or when I died, the world would just keep turning. People would still go to work, the trolleys would keep running, the Sun would still rise.

Despite that existential thought, I was still filled with trepidation about what Claire had told me, and kept vigilant. However, no doors were opening for me, or at least ones I hadn’t opened myself. I wished she was less cryptic with her directions.

However, later on in the day, I was tasked with assisting a lawyer up to the 9th floor. She had a few heavy boxes that she needed to deliver to her boss right away, so I offered to help her carry the boxes up. We walked down the long hallway on the 9th floor, engaging in idle chatter. After delivering the boxes, we walked back to the elevator lobby. Just as I moved my hand to press the ‘down’ button, the elevator door swung open, with nobody inside.

I froze. 

The door will open. Do not go through.

“Would you look at that, we didn’t even need to press the button,” the lawyer said, chuckling. “I think that’s what they call kismet.”

“Stop.” I said abruptly. 

The lawyer laughed awkwardly, thinking I was joking, until I held my arms up to bar her from entering. 

	
“Uh, Noah, what’s wrong? You alright?”
	
“Don’t go in.” I said with as much authority as I could muster.
	
“Is there something wrong with the elevator?” asked the lawyer, growing nervous with my behavior.
	
Just as the doors started to close, the lights inside the elevator began to blink erratically, and within a second, we watched as the elevator cab plummeted down the shaft, creating a grating, metallic roar. Within another second, we heard an apocalyptic crash just nine floors down.
	
“Holy fucking shit,” said the lawyer, hyperventilating. “Noah, you just saved my fucking life. What the fuck?”
	
We looked at each other, both visibly shaking, our eyes wide.
	
The door will open. Do not go through.
	
It was true. It was all true. Claire was some kind of psychic. She had just saved my life. I started laughing nervously, which turned into crying.
	
Just what is going on here?

Once again, the building was closed down so the engineering staff could inspect the elevators for issues. The last inspection was only a few weeks prior, so everyone seemed to be confused as to how this could have happened. There were no obvious defects.

“The elevators aren’t even that old. There’s no reason this should have happened,” one exasperated engineer explained to me. “At this point, I think we’re gonna have to chalk it up to an act of God.”

The words sent shivers down my spine. 

/  /  /

“I see you did not go through the open door,” Claire said to me the next morning. “Or else you would not be here today.”

“Claire… I don’t know how to thank you. You saved my life,” I replied. “I do wish you had told me more information, but I’m grateful all the same.”

“You do not need to thank me,” she said, smiling. “I must thank you. You are not meant to die.”

I considered this. “Well… what am I meant for? What is my purpose?”

“To talk to God.”

“To talk to God?”

“When the time is right.”

“When will it be the right time?”

She shrugged. “The things I know change–”

“Day by day, I get it,” I fiddled with my hands nervously. “What am I to do today?”

Claire stopped smiling, and looked out the window of the trolley. “Today will be a little bit harder. For you.”

“Harder? How so?”

Once again, her phone rang, and she placed it up to her ear. She seemed to listen for a moment, then said, “Are you sure he can?”

“Whatever it is, I’ll do it,” I said with determination. “I know now how important your directions are. I’ll do anything.”

She looked back at me with empathetic eyes.

“You will face a choice. Do not choose.”

I paused. “Uh… is that the most specific you can be?”

“Yes, I told him,” she said to her phone.

We rolled up to Claire’s usual stop, and she stood up, still frowning uncharacteristically. “I’m sorry, Noah Sebastian Silas Grady Brady.”

I cringed at the sound of my full name. “Don’t be sorry. I’ll do what you say.”

Claire flashed me a sympathetic smirk, then walked off the trolley silently; no skipping, no humming. This worried me. It seemed this request was even more dire than the last two, which was scary considering what those requests ended up being for. Plus, this was even more cryptic than before; I hoped whichever choice I was presented with would be obvious.

Today was a Saturday, which meant work would be much slower than usual. The only people at the office were the true workaholics, and I typically didn’t see more than 10 people the entire day.

Just before my lunch break, a business manager from the 11th floor stopped by the console. All of the security guards knew him as the single biggest prick in the entire building. He would often make demands of us despite him not being our boss, which only managed to piss off every single guard on every single shift.

“Brady,” said Orson, the aforementioned asshole. This was his way of greeting me. “I’m going to be working all day up on 11, and I don’t want to be disturbed. This means no calls, no visitors, no nothing. If I get a single call, Mr. Cottingham will be notified immediately. Understand?”

“Yes, sir,” I replied pleasantly. He rarely had visitors on weekends anyways, so this was not a huge deal. He walked away without even saying thank you.

I realized as I went about my day that life was all about choices. Choosing to go to one bathroom stall over another. Choosing to clock out for lunch at 11 or 11:15. Choosing to eat my sandwich first or my chips first. How could I be sure which choice was the one I was not supposed to choose? It seemed like an impossible task, and I started to understand why Claire had said this directive would be more difficult than the others.

About an hour later, after my break, a man wearing casual clothes showed up at the front door of the building, which was locked on weekends. I allowed him in. He appeared frantic and shaky. 

“I’m here to see Orson, up on 11. He’s having a medical episode,” the man explained. “I need to get these meds to him right away. There’s no time.”

I paused. This was it.

You will face a choice. Do not choose.

I had never seen this man before. I had no idea if he was telling the truth. If I send him up, I could lose my job. If I don’t, Orson could potentially die.

Do not choose.

“I… don’t care,” I finally said, my heart pounding. The man looked at me quizzically, but ran off towards the elevators without another word. I watched him up on the cameras as he went up and got off at the 11th floor.
	
I thought about it. I technically made a choice, but it was more so the choice to not make a choice. It seemed oxymoronic, but I hoped I had done the right thing.

What worried me most was the fact that this seemed to be the easiest direction I had received so far, which was in stark contrast to how Claire was acting about the choice earlier. She implied it was going to be hard. Was this really the matter she was referring to?

Unfortunately, my questions were answered less than an hour later. 

The man from earlier returned to the lobby, his clothes drenched in blood. He was laughing maniacally, and breathing hard. I stood there, in a daze. He then collapsed to the floor, wheezing.

“That stupid motherfucker… Motherfucker…”

He just kept repeating curse words while wheezing like a detuned accordion. My hands shaking, I called the police.

/  /  /

The police showed up quickly, arrested the crazed man who was still muttering on the floor, and went on to investigate the 11th floor, where they found Orson with 42 stab wounds: dead. The police explained that they found evidence that showed the killer was a disgruntled ex-employee of Orson’s.

“So, you allowed the suspect, a certain Mark Kobelchek, into the building?” a detective asked me after the police had left with the killer. 
      
“I did. Doors are locked during the weekend, so we always have to manually let people in, unless they have a keycard.”

“I see. So he didn’t have a keycard. How was he able to access the 11th floor without a keycard? Don’t you need one for the elevators as well?”

I paused. There was no way out of this except to lie.

“Mr. Orson said to allow any visitors that arrived up to the 11th floor. Apparently he was expecting a lot of people today.”

“I see. That’s unfortunate,” the detective scribbled a few notes onto his pad. “We may have more questions for you in the future, but this seems to be an open-and-shut case. We’ll reach out if we need anything.”

After the police left, I called Mr. Cottingham and explained everything that occurred.

“I swear to God, our building is going to shit. Everyday there’s a new goddamn problem,” Mr. Cottingham said, frustrated. “What the hell did we do to deserve all this?”

After my shift, I took the trolley home and thought about my actions. This one did seem really bad. My inaction, or my lack of choosing, caused a man to be murdered. Why would Claire want to ensure this man’s death? He was an asshole, sure, but he didn’t deserve to be stabbed 42 times by a crazed madman. I felt very conflicted. On one hand, Claire had saved my life. On the other, Claire had ensured a man’s death. What was her goal here?

I thought some more, and I had a sudden realization. Perhaps this was another way of saving my life. If I hadn’t allowed the man to go up to the 11th floor, maybe he would’ve killed me. Maybe my lack of action was exactly what saved my life. Perhaps this was Claire’s intention. 

Still, I had another near-sleepless night. Visions of Neal’s death, the elevator plummeting, and the blood-drenched man filled my mind. I realized I was thankful for Claire saving my life, but I still had to know the real, ultimate purpose behind her strange directives. I decided I would confront her tomorrow and finally demand answers.

///

I marched into the trolley, determined to have my many questions answered. However, I was shocked to find the trolley car was empty. No Claire, no anybody.

Maybe she takes the day off on Sunday, I thought, and decided I would try again tomorrow, on my day off.

///

Once again, no Claire to be found. Since I had no work, I got off on her usual stop and waited at the station nearly all day. No strange blue-haired women appeared. I started feeling discouraged.

///

A month passed. My days were uneventful. I went back to drinking nightly. Everyday I got on the trolley, I hoped I’d see Claire again, sitting there smiling, waiting to deliver a prophecy just for me. But she never appeared.

My confusion turned to depression, which turned to anger. What gave her the right to come into my life, make me believe I had a purpose in this world, just to disappear? How could I be so stupid to actually believe I’d ever mean anything to this fucked up world? I was just a depressed, anxious, drunken mess of a person. I felt more useless than ever.

I don’t know who the hell Claire was, but I had decided I hated her. Or perhaps I just hated the feeling of being purposeless. That was probably more likely.

However, one random Saturday, a thought crossed my mind. One of Claire’s objectives. Her first one.

Go to the roof. Talk to God.

I remembered that when I had asked her my purpose, she had plainly said it. 

To talk to God. When the time is right.

I stood up from the console, my knees quivering. I knew what I had to do. The time was right.

I radioed the janitor, Yvan, to allow me up to the top floor with his special key. He was behind schedule, so he begrudgingly gave me his key to the roof. “Don’t go killin’ yerself like the last guy that asked me for that, alright?”

I walked up the steps leading to the roof, each step heavier than the last. I knew my fate, my purpose, was awaiting me. I felt terrified, but also strangely tranquil. My heart pounded in my chest, and my stomach was filled with butterflies.

I finally reached the door, inserted the key, and walked out onto the patio, the wind immediately pummeling me. I looked over to the ledge where Neal had jumped, and there she was.

Claire.

She turned around, smiling. Her phone was up to her ear.

“Yes, he’s finally here,” she said to her phone. Her hair seemed to dance in the wild wind. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

I slowly walked up to her, breathing shallow. She looked right at me.

“You’ve proven yourself,” she said to me. “Are you ready to talk to God?”

I nodded. “Y-yes. I am.”

She handed me her phone. I slowly put the phone up to my ear.

Tears began uncontrollably streaming down my face. A blissful feeling ran through my entire body, and I soon became enraptured in pure, unbridled ecstasy. I began to laugh, and laugh, and laugh.

I knew, even as I fell, that I had fulfilled my purpose. And it was beautiful.",1,1737171652.0,u_susbrother,0,1.0,False
1i3yt7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/sadstories/comments/1i3yt7i/after_the_fall/,After the Fall,"The room is silent, except for the soft sound of Ethan’s sobs, muffled by the thick blankets that have become a cocoon around him. The light from the window spills weakly across the bed, illuminating the way his shoulders tremble, a man lost in the deepest well of grief. I want to reach out, to comfort him, but the space between us feels vast, as if I were standing on the edge of a canyon and he was miles away at the bottom.

I watch him, not knowing how to cross the distance that’s grown between us, the weight of it pressing down on me. I should feel pity, I should feel sorrow, but instead, I feel something else. Something colder. Guilt. I know the divorce papers are still tucked in the glove compartment of my car, that familiar, suffocating envelope. I’ve hidden them there for months, convinced that if I waited long enough, things would get better. But they haven’t. And watching Ethan now, curled into himself, I wonder if they ever will.

I run my fingers over the surface of the bedside table, stopping on the family photo we took last Christmas. Ethan’s arm around me, smiling, before everything changed. Before the phone call that shattered our world.

Adam’s death feels like it happened just yesterday. I remember that night so clearly. I remember Ethan’s voice breaking on the phone, the tremor in his words as he told me that Adam was gone. I remember his panic, the way he held the phone too tight, like he could hold onto the words long enough to reverse the truth. But even as he mourned his brother, something inside of him cracked wide open—and I was left standing beside him, unable to get through the wall he built between us.

At first, I tried to be patient. I told myself that he needed time. But the weeks turned into months, and the months into years, and I watched him pull further away, drowning in his grief while I stood on the shore, helpless. I kept hoping that one day, he would come back to me. But he didn’t.

I had my own grief to bear. Two months after Adam passed, my aunt Marcy, the one person who had been my second mother, died suddenly of a stroke. It should’ve been me crumbling under the weight of that loss, but I didn’t. I couldn’t. I kept moving. I buried my sorrow, threw myself into my routines, into the things that used to make me feel like me. I showed up to work every day, met friends for lunch, smiled when I needed to smile. I had to. There was no one else to be strong for me.

But where was Ethan? Where was the man who used to hold me when I cried, the man who would call me just to hear my voice? He had disappeared, retreating into the shadow of Adam’s absence, until it felt like there was no room for me anymore. I kept waiting, always waiting, hoping he would see me. That he would understand that I needed him too. But it never came.

I still remember the night I finally realized that it wasn’t just his brother he had lost—it was everything. Friends had stopped calling him. He no longer went to work. The invitation to family events were met with silence. And it wasn’t just his social life that slipped away—he stopped engaging with me, too. I could see it in the vacant way he looked at me across the dinner table, in the long silences we shared in bed. He was there, but he wasn’t.

I remember one Sunday morning, after a particularly long week of pretending I was fine, I went out for coffee with Chloe, a friend I hadn’t seen in weeks. When I came back, Ethan was sitting in the same spot on the couch, staring blankly at the TV. I could tell by the glassy look in his eyes that he hadn’t moved. I wanted to say something, anything—ask him how he was doing, how we were doing—but the words caught in my throat. I wasn’t sure if he could even hear me anymore.

I went into the kitchen to make us lunch, trying to ignore the feeling of suffocating beneath the weight of his silence. It wasn’t just that I was alone in the house; I was alone in the marriage we had built.

Ethan didn’t even ask where I’d been, didn’t notice the time I had spent away from him. I could feel the resentment building inside me. I needed him. I needed him to see that I was still here. That I, too, had lost something. But he couldn’t see it. All I could do was keep pretending.

I kept up my routines, kept socializing, kept going to work. I even went to a family dinner a few months ago and laughed, the sound feeling strange in my ears. It was a brief moment when I felt like the person I used to be, before all of this. But when I came home, Ethan was still sitting in the dark, lost in the same grief that had swallowed him years ago. And I felt a pang of guilt, too—a guilt for feeling so far away from him, a guilt for the moments I had lived without him.

But what was I supposed to do? How could I keep living in a house with someone who couldn’t see me, couldn’t even see himself?

The hardest part is that I stayed. I stayed and waited for him to notice, for him to see that I was still here, that I, too, was hurting. But he couldn’t. And now I realize that I waited for so long that the woman who once loved him has almost disappeared. And the worst part is, I don’t know if he even remembers her anymore.

I’ve already lost so much—Aunt Marcy, the woman who helped shape who I am; the sense of connection I once had with the man I married; the hope that things would ever return to what they were. And now, I feel like I’m losing him too.

The papers in my glove compartment are a cold reminder of how far we’ve come from where we started. A painful truth I’ve been avoiding. But I can’t wait any longer. I can’t pretend anymore. I need to breathe again. I need to be someone else.

The weight of the divorce papers in my car feels suffocating, but they’re the only way I can start to live again. Because I can’t keep waiting for him to find me in the darkness. And I can’t keep pretending that I don’t feel like I’ve already lost him.",1,1737171628.0,sadstories,0,1.0,False
1i3yshv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i3yshv/mf_talk_to_god/,[MF] Talk to God,"Every morning I took the trolley to work in downtown San Diego. The ride was nice, albeit a bit long, necessitating me to wake up much earlier than if I had driven. But I was able to listen to music, read a book, or people-watch in the 45 minutes it took to get to the building where I worked as a security guard. I was apprehensive about taking the trolley at first, but in time I really began to appreciate the odd charm of public transportation, and I started looking forward to the trips. I definitely did not miss sitting in traffic, and the trolley fare was cheaper than gas.

Regardless, driving was not really a choice for me even if I wanted to. In a delirious state, I had totalled my mother’s old soccer mom van about six months prior. I learned many valuable lessons that day, primarily that two hours was not enough sleep to get over your blubbering drunkenness from the night before. I had been late for work that morning; I threw my clothes on, hopped in the car, and drove not 20 feet before I absolutely smashed into my elderly neighbor’s SUV. I will never forget the sheer terror I felt in the moment that I hit the rear of that vehicle. In a stupor, I began to cry, like a newborn. The neighbors took pity on me and did not involve the police, even though the previous night’s alcohol was likely still present in my unwashed musk. My insurance took care of it, but I was without a car. It seemed like a fair deal to me.

It’s true, I have been known to be a bit of a drunkard at times. It’s probably best that I didn’t drive anymore. In recent months, I had begun growing very chubby as a result of drinking exactly six IPA’s nightly before bed, sometimes more on the weekends. I would wake up sick and nauseous almost every morning. I had feigned to my friends and family that I was merely a craft beer enthusiast, when in reality I was very clearly plunging slowly into alcoholism.

But it didn’t really matter. I was a college drop-out with no plans and a lot of regrets that I had to drink to forget. My job was extremely low-pressure; I was just a lowly security guard that sat in the lobby of a large office building and simply greeted employees as they walked in. There was never any trouble besides a random homeless lunatic every now and then, so it didn’t matter if I came in hungover and half-asleep. My boss was just glad that I showed up at all.

I checked my watch. It was 6:00am exactly, and I could see the trolley’s lights slowly work its way through the dense fog of the early morning. The trolley gave out a cute little “PTOOOOO” in a pathetic attempt to mimic a train whistle.

The trolley rolled up, came to a full stop, shuddered, and plopped its doors open. I strolled in and took my usual seat near the back. There was always ample seating in the early morning. I decided to listen to the oddly soothing sound of the rumbling trolley instead of my music, which I did not normally do. I looked around my compartment as the trolley started moving again. Some people were fast asleep, hunched over the backpacks in their lap as if they were preparing for an airplane crash. Others listened to music, some read the newspaper, and a few sipped on their coffees. The sun was just starting to ride, but it was still mostly dark, creating a comfy, nostalgic atmosphere in the trolley car; it was almost as if we were existing outside of time. This was my favorite part of the day.

Ah, my fellow working stiffs, I thought with amusement. On our way to sell our souls for breadcrumbs. I loved everyone on the trolley, as I felt a certain kinship with them; no one wanted to be up this early. Yet here we all were, each for our own reasons. It was a weirdly beautiful thing. On the highway, everyone was my potential enemy. In the trolley, everyone was my friend.

I looked to my left, and to my surprise, someone was staring straight at me. I initially assumed it was an unwell homeless person, but I stole another glance and it appeared to be an attractive woman with light blue hair. My heart fluttered. Why was a woman like that looking at a schlub like me? I knew for a fact that I did not look good that day, as I had stopped caring about my looks once my face took upon a round appearance, much like Charlie Brown. I had stopped looking in the mirror, and I had shaved my head so I didn’t have to bother with my hair. My hair annoyed me. Needless to say, I looked like shit.

“You work at 501 West Broadway, don’t you, Noah Sebastion Silas Grady Brady?”

I sat there flabbergasted. The woman had a wise tone, and spoke in what seemed to be a vaguely Icelandic accent. 

“I’m sorry, but how in the world do you know my full name?” Her knowing my place of work was not the weirdest thing, as my uniform was peculiar and only worn by the security guards at my building. But my name was embarrassing and I did everything to keep it secret so as to not make it a source of mockery back in high school. I escaped high school with my dignity, but adulthood was clearly not being so kind. “That’s not even on my driver’s license!”

“The things I know change day by day… But I do somehow know your name. I know you’re 22, almost 23. Isn’t that weird?”

I gulped. This was taking a sinister turn. This was definitely abnormal for the morning trolley. Due to her dreamy manner of speaking, I began to suspect that she was on some kind of drug, but she did not physically appear to be under the influence of anything.

“...Who are you?”

“I’m Claire… I suppose.”

“You know my name, but you’re unsure of yours…?”

“It’s complicated. Anyway. I feel there is something you should know.”

I gulped again, audibly, like a cartoon character.

“Remember: go to the roof. Talk to God.”

I shuddered, and tears inexplicably sprung to my eyes. I had no idea what she was talking about, but her words seemed to puncture something deep within my soul.

“What… what do you mean?”

Claire stared at me, smiling, until a loud, dainty jingle emitted from the phone she held in her hand. Still staring at me, she put the phone up to her ear, and the ringtone ceased. She did not offer any kind of greeting, she merely appeared to listen to whoever was on the other end.

“Yes, I told him,” she finally said.

“Next stop, 5th and Imperial,” the trolley’s intercom chimed.

“This is my stop,” Claire said, then she gently placed her hand on mine. It felt as light as air. “Remember: go to the roof.”

“Arriving. 5th and Imperial.” The trolley doors plopped open. Claire took one last concerned look at me, then skipped off the trolley, happily humming some poppy tune. I sat there, at a complete loss for words.

“Doors closing,” said the chipper loudspeaker.

The doors closed, and I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. I looked out the window to see if I could see where she was going, but she seemed to only be standing awkwardly next to a pillar at the station, still on her phone.

My heart was beating fast. I felt more awake than I had ever been at this time.

“Remember, go to the roof.” she had said. I wonder what it meant. And who was she talking to on the phone? “Talk to God.”

My mind reeled, trying to search for a rational reason this may have occurred. She was probably on drugs. Or in some kind of religious cult. But the way she spoke and moved seemed very… unnatural. I had the nauseating feeling of uncanny valley come over me. I also couldn’t deny that her words, although cryptic, had strangely affected me in a way I still couldn’t explain.

“Hey man, what was she saying to you?” some curious guy a few seats ahead of swung around to ask.

“Just some nonsense,” I shyly chuckled, avoiding eye contact. I was not good at eye contact. “Something about talking to God.”

The dude smirked. “Makes sense. A new hippie cult showed up somewhere in the outskirts of National City recently. Heard the cops popped off their leader, so maybe they’re goin’ nuts now.” He laughed, as did I, even though I did not find the words funny. He continued, “But I don’t know. Some people are more powerful in death than they ever could have been in life.”

The rest of the ride was uneventful. I decided not to get coffee as I already felt wired.

Remember: go to the roof. Talk to God.

As soon as I walked into my building, I saw my short boss standing at the security console in the lobby, looking around. His stature and the way he walked always reminded me of a penguin for some reason; and the suit he wore only contributed to that notion.

“Mr. Cottingham,” I said as I approached the console. “Good morning.”

“Morning, Mr. Brady. Have you seen Neal around?” Neal was the nightshift officer who I was supposed to be relieving. He was a strange guy who always wore a dingey cap to work despite that being against the rules for guards.

“I have not. He’s usually at the desk when I arrive. Was he not here?”

Mr. Cottingham shook his head. “I can’t find him. He knows he’s only allowed to leave the console if he’s going to the bathroom.”

I decided to stick up for him. “He could be confronting a transient, I know they’re more of an issue during the night shift.”

“I supposed. But I didn’t see him around the perimeter of the building. Any idea where he might be?”

Go to the roof.

I shuddered and shook off the thought. We were never allowed to go to the roof of the building.

“No idea.”

“Well, can you check around the building again? Maybe I missed him. I’ll man the console while you’re away.”

I nodded, grabbed my walkie-talkie and my keyset, and set off for a patrol around the building.

Trying to guide my thoughts away from my peculiar encounter this morning, I surveyed the city streets as they were beginning to come alive. People sipped hot coffee while on their way to their respective offices, bicyclists raced by, and joggers occasionally ran by in packs. I felt the cold morning wind bite my face as I stuck my hands in my suit pockets to stay warm. So far, no sign of Neal.

Go to the roof.

There was simply no way Neal was on the roof. We were strictly prohibited from going to the top floor; there was a nice pair of conference rooms that were always set up for an imminent fundraiser, work event, or the like, and other security guards from times gone past have stolen things from these conference rooms, leading them to be off-limits for all staff except janitorial. On the rare occasion that we needed to go to the roof, janitorial’s manager would have to escort us and allow us in with a key only he had access to.

Go to the roof.

I sighed and decided to radio my boss, defeated. “Come in, Mr. Cottingham.”

“Cottingham here,” the radio chirped in response. “You find him?”

“Negative. Have you asked Yvan if he let Neal up to the top floor?”

“You think he’s on the roof?” Mr. Cottingham seemed to find it unlikely. “I’ll ask him. Keep looking though.”

Unable to keep the thought from my brain, I chose to jog across the street to see if I could catch a glimpse of the top floor. As I squinted up at the roof, my heart seized. There was indeed a figure standing on the ledge of the roof. I could barely see who it was, but it appeared the person was wearing a cap.

Neal.

Suddenly, the figure on the ledge crossed his arms and calmly fell backwards off the roof, beginning a rapid plummet towards the Earth. 

I instinctively closed my eyes and turned away, only to hear a thunderous splat, a pathetic death grunt, and the shattering of 270 bones, all in one horrific, simultaneous moment. It was quite possibly the worst sound I had ever heard. I could hear people around scream in horror and surprise.

A loud bell began clanging in the nearby clocktower, indicating it was precisely 7am. With my heart beating rapidly, I steeled myself, slowly crossed the street, and looked at the body. I grimaced; it could hardly be referred to as a body at this point. The height of the building didn’t seem to be quite enough to annihilate the corpse into an unctuous puddle of bones and blood, but it certainly killed him instantly; blood was pooling out of every orifice in his head, each of his limbs were askew, and it seemed his torso had attempted to fold in upon itself. Despite the constant stream of blood obscuring the man’s features, I could still see the man had been wearing our building’s uniform. This was definitely Neal.

Panting wildly, I looked around to see a crowd of people had formed, each processing the horror of the moment in their own way. Some screamed, some cried, some held their hands over their mouths in abject terror. I watched as Mr. Cottingham raced out of the front door to see what was happening. First he saw the body, then he looked up at me in confusion.

“I found him,” I said.

/  /  /

I was sent home for the day, since the building was closed so the cleaning crews could scrub the sidewalk and erase any evidence that a suicide had just occurred there. Mr. Cottingham also wanted to make sure that I didn’t go insane due to the trauma of what I had witnessed; after all, he was already down one employee, he couldn’t afford to lose another.
	
The entire trolley ride home, I couldn’t help but feel guilty. If I had just went to the roof, like I had been told by Claire, then perhaps I could have prevented what happened. I felt that my inaction inadvertently caused the death of my co-worker.
	
Additionally, I wondered how Claire knew what would happen. How did she, or the person on that phone with her, know that something was going to happen involving the roof? Was she psychic? Did she play a part in Neal’s death? Neal was always an odd one, but he didn’t seem suicidal. But truthfully, I didn’t know him well enough to say for sure. 

I recalled having a strange conversation with Neal about a week ago, the last time I saw him alive, that I hadn’t found too significant until now. 

“Do you believe in free will?” Neal had asked me while I was busy clocking in. He was still gathering his things to go.

“Me? Uh, I guess,” I had replied. “Why, do you?”

“I used to,” Neal said, avoiding eye contact. “I’d like to believe I have control over my actions. But I’m starting to think something else, whether religious in nature or not, is pulling the strings.”

I remember considering this before trying to change the subject; the conversation was getting a bit too esoteric for 7am. 
	
That night, as I tried to sleep, Neal’s death and our last conversation kept replaying in my head. I had never witnessed anything that horrible in my life, and the guilt inside of me kept growing and growing by the second. I settled on one thing before I managed to finally fall asleep: if I saw Claire again, I would take more of an effort to follow whichever directive she may give. 

/  /  /

I woke up the next morning, just as tired as if I hadn’t slept at all. I showered, donned my suit, and walked myself to the trolley station. I was so tired I could barely think, but when I did, my thoughts drifted towards Claire. I was apprehensive at the thought of seeing her again, but still wanted her to appear again just the same.

Lo and behold, I walked into the trolley car when it arrived and saw Claire sitting in the back, directly next to the seat I had been sitting in yesterday. She noticed me, smiled, and patted on the seat next to her, beckoning me to sit down. I obeyed wordlessly; I didn’t even know what to say.

As the trolley lurched forwards, Claire turned to me. “You didn’t go to the roof,” she said, but didn’t sound disappointed, more like she was just stating a fact. “Why not?”

“I’m sorry,” I replied, looking down. “I should have.”

Suddenly, her phone began ringing again, breaking the silence of the trolley. A man who had been trying to sleep looked over, annoyed. Once again, Claire put the phone up to her ear, still maintaining her enigmatic gaze at me. The ringing stopped.

“The door will open; do not go through.” she said. Like yesterday, I felt a strange surge of emotion run through me, despite having no idea what she was referring to. Suddenly, I felt the need to get answers from her before her stop.

“H-how did you know what was going to happen yesterday?” I asked incredulously. “Why didn’t you tell me more?!”

She shrugged. “The things I know change day by day,” she replied, as if it were obvious. She stood up and spoke into the phone: “Yes, I told him.”

“Wait,” I said desperately as she started walking towards the trolley doors. “Who are you on the phone with?”

The trolley rolled to a stop, and the doors opened with a ding. She looked back at me.

“God.” she replied, then skipped out, humming the same infectious tune as yesterday.

“God.” I repeated to myself, at a loss.

The door will open. Do not go through.

I was determined to follow her advice this time. The trolley soon reached my stop and I headed towards my building. I wondered if I had already failed the prophecy by going through the open trolley doors. Was I supposed to stay on the trolley forever?

/  /  /

My work day started off slowly; I did my typical duties. People looked at me with sympathy, but never asked me about Neal; I supposed they didn’t want to stir up any latent trauma within me. As I did my patrol around the building, I checked the sidewalk where Neal fell, and there wasn’t a trace of anything; the cleaning crews had done an excellent job. People walked by, trampling over the exact spot Neal had died, none the wiser. It was always shocking to be reminded that no matter how or when I died, the world would just keep turning. People would still go to work, the trolleys would keep running, the Sun would still rise.

Despite that existential thought, I was still filled with trepidation about what Claire had told me, and kept vigilant. However, no doors were opening for me, or at least ones I hadn’t opened myself. I wished she was less cryptic with her directions.

However, later on in the day, I was tasked with assisting a lawyer up to the 9th floor. She had a few heavy boxes that she needed to deliver to her boss right away, so I offered to help her carry the boxes up. We walked down the long hallway on the 9th floor, engaging in idle chatter. After delivering the boxes, we walked back to the elevator lobby. Just as I moved my hand to press the ‘down’ button, the elevator door swung open, with nobody inside.

I froze. 

The door will open. Do not go through.

“Would you look at that, we didn’t even need to press the button,” the lawyer said, chuckling. “I think that’s what they call kismet.”

“Stop.” I said abruptly. 

The lawyer laughed awkwardly, thinking I was joking, until I held my arms up to bar her from entering. 

	
“Uh, Noah, what’s wrong? You alright?”
	
“Don’t go in.” I said with as much authority as I could muster.
	
“Is there something wrong with the elevator?” asked the lawyer, growing nervous with my behavior.
	
Just as the doors started to close, the lights inside the elevator began to blink erratically, and within a second, we watched as the elevator cab plummeted down the shaft, creating a grating, metallic roar. Within another second, we heard an apocalyptic crash just nine floors down.
	
“Holy fucking shit,” said the lawyer, hyperventilating. “Noah, you just saved my fucking life. What the fuck?”
	
We looked at each other, both visibly shaking, our eyes wide.
	
The door will open. Do not go through.
	
It was true. It was all true. Claire was some kind of psychic. She had just saved my life. I started laughing nervously, which turned into crying.
	
Just what is going on here?

Once again, the building was closed down so the engineering staff could inspect the elevators for issues. The last inspection was only a few weeks prior, so everyone seemed to be confused as to how this could have happened. There were no obvious defects.

“The elevators aren’t even that old. There’s no reason this should have happened,” one exasperated engineer explained to me. “At this point, I think we’re gonna have to chalk it up to an act of God.”

The words sent shivers down my spine. 

/  /  /

“I see you did not go through the open door,” Claire said to me the next morning. “Or else you would not be here today.”

“Claire… I don’t know how to thank you. You saved my life,” I replied. “I do wish you had told me more information, but I’m grateful all the same.”

“You do not need to thank me,” she said, smiling. “I must thank you. You are not meant to die.”

I considered this. “Well… what am I meant for? What is my purpose?”

“To talk to God.”

“To talk to God?”

“When the time is right.”

“When will it be the right time?”

She shrugged. “The things I know change–”

“Day by day, I get it,” I fiddled with my hands nervously. “What am I to do today?”

Claire stopped smiling, and looked out the window of the trolley. “Today will be a little bit harder. For you.”

“Harder? How so?”

Once again, her phone rang, and she placed it up to her ear. She seemed to listen for a moment, then said, “Are you sure he can?”

“Whatever it is, I’ll do it,” I said with determination. “I know now how important your directions are. I’ll do anything.”

She looked back at me with empathetic eyes.

“You will face a choice. Do not choose.”

I paused. “Uh… is that the most specific you can be?”

“Yes, I told him,” she said to her phone.

We rolled up to Claire’s usual stop, and she stood up, still frowning uncharacteristically. “I’m sorry, Noah Sebastian Silas Grady Brady.”

I cringed at the sound of my full name. “Don’t be sorry. I’ll do what you say.”

Claire flashed me a sympathetic smirk, then walked off the trolley silently; no skipping, no humming. This worried me. It seemed this request was even more dire than the last two, which was scary considering what those requests ended up being for. Plus, this was even more cryptic than before; I hoped whichever choice I was presented with would be obvious.

Today was a Saturday, which meant work would be much slower than usual. The only people at the office were the true workaholics, and I typically didn’t see more than 10 people the entire day.

Just before my lunch break, a business manager from the 11th floor stopped by the console. All of the security guards knew him as the single biggest prick in the entire building. He would often make demands of us despite him not being our boss, which only managed to piss off every single guard on every single shift.

“Brady,” said Orson, the aforementioned asshole. This was his way of greeting me. “I’m going to be working all day up on 11, and I don’t want to be disturbed. This means no calls, no visitors, no nothing. If I get a single call, Mr. Cottingham will be notified immediately. Understand?”

“Yes, sir,” I replied pleasantly. He rarely had visitors on weekends anyways, so this was not a huge deal. He walked away without even saying thank you.

I realized as I went about my day that life was all about choices. Choosing to go to one bathroom stall over another. Choosing to clock out for lunch at 11 or 11:15. Choosing to eat my sandwich first or my chips first. How could I be sure which choice was the one I was not supposed to choose? It seemed like an impossible task, and I started to understand why Claire had said this directive would be more difficult than the others.

About an hour later, after my break, a man wearing casual clothes showed up at the front door of the building, which was locked on weekends. I allowed him in. He appeared frantic and shaky. 

“I’m here to see Orson, up on 11. He’s having a medical episode,” the man explained. “I need to get these meds to him right away. There’s no time.”

I paused. This was it.

You will face a choice. Do not choose.

I had never seen this man before. I had no idea if he was telling the truth. If I send him up, I could lose my job. If I don’t, Orson could potentially die.

Do not choose.

“I… don’t care,” I finally said, my heart pounding. The man looked at me quizzically, but ran off towards the elevators without another word. I watched him up on the cameras as he went up and got off at the 11th floor.
	
I thought about it. I technically made a choice, but it was more so the choice to not make a choice. It seemed oxymoronic, but I hoped I had done the right thing.

What worried me most was the fact that this seemed to be the easiest direction I had received so far, which was in stark contrast to how Claire was acting about the choice earlier. She implied it was going to be hard. Was this really the matter she was referring to?

Unfortunately, my questions were answered less than an hour later. 

The man from earlier returned to the lobby, his clothes drenched in blood. He was laughing maniacally, and breathing hard. I stood there, in a daze. He then collapsed to the floor, wheezing.

“That stupid motherfucker… Motherfucker…”

He just kept repeating curse words while wheezing like a detuned accordion. My hands shaking, I called the police.

/  /  /

The police showed up quickly, arrested the crazed man who was still muttering on the floor, and went on to investigate the 11th floor, where they found Orson with 42 stab wounds: dead. The police explained that they found evidence that showed the killer was a disgruntled ex-employee of Orson’s.

“So, you allowed the suspect, a certain Mark Kobelchek, into the building?” a detective asked me after the police had left with the killer. 
      
“I did. Doors are locked during the weekend, so we always have to manually let people in, unless they have a keycard.”

“I see. So he didn’t have a keycard. How was he able to access the 11th floor without a keycard? Don’t you need one for the elevators as well?”

I paused. There was no way out of this except to lie.

“Mr. Orson said to allow any visitors that arrived up to the 11th floor. Apparently he was expecting a lot of people today.”

“I see. That’s unfortunate,” the detective scribbled a few notes onto his pad. “We may have more questions for you in the future, but this seems to be an open-and-shut case. We’ll reach out if we need anything.”

After the police left, I called Mr. Cottingham and explained everything that occurred.

“I swear to God, our building is going to shit. Everyday there’s a new goddamn problem,” Mr. Cottingham said, frustrated. “What the hell did we do to deserve all this?”

After my shift, I took the trolley home and thought about my actions. This one did seem really bad. My inaction, or my lack of choosing, caused a man to be murdered. Why would Claire want to ensure this man’s death? He was an asshole, sure, but he didn’t deserve to be stabbed 42 times by a crazed madman. I felt very conflicted. On one hand, Claire had saved my life. On the other, Claire had ensured a man’s death. What was her goal here?

I thought some more, and I had a sudden realization. Perhaps this was another way of saving my life. If I hadn’t allowed the man to go up to the 11th floor, maybe he would’ve killed me. Maybe my lack of action was exactly what saved my life. Perhaps this was Claire’s intention. 

Still, I had another near-sleepless night. Visions of Neal’s death, the elevator plummeting, and the blood-drenched man filled my mind. I realized I was thankful for Claire saving my life, but I still had to know the real, ultimate purpose behind her strange directives. I decided I would confront her tomorrow and finally demand answers.

///

I marched into the trolley, determined to have my many questions answered. However, I was shocked to find the trolley car was empty. No Claire, no anybody.

Maybe she takes the day off on Sunday, I thought, and decided I would try again tomorrow, on my day off.

///

Once again, no Claire to be found. Since I had no work, I got off on her usual stop and waited at the station nearly all day. No strange blue-haired women appeared. I started feeling discouraged.

///

A month passed. My days were uneventful. I went back to drinking nightly. Everyday I got on the trolley, I hoped I’d see Claire again, sitting there smiling, waiting to deliver a prophecy just for me. But she never appeared.

My confusion turned to depression, which turned to anger. What gave her the right to come into my life, make me believe I had a purpose in this world, just to disappear? How could I be so stupid to actually believe I’d ever mean anything to this fucked up world? I was just a depressed, anxious, drunken mess of a person. I felt more useless than ever.

I don’t know who the hell Claire was, but I had decided I hated her. Or perhaps I just hated the feeling of being purposeless. That was probably more likely.

However, one random Saturday, a thought crossed my mind. One of Claire’s objectives. Her first one.

Go to the roof. Talk to God.

I remembered that when I had asked her my purpose, she had plainly said it. 

To talk to God. When the time is right.

I stood up from the console, my knees quivering. I knew what I had to do. The time was right.

I radioed the janitor, Yvan, to allow me up to the top floor with his special key. He was behind schedule, so he begrudgingly gave me his key to the roof. “Don’t go killin’ yerself like the last guy that asked me for that, alright?”

I walked up the steps leading to the roof, each step heavier than the last. I knew my fate, my purpose, was awaiting me. I felt terrified, but also strangely tranquil. My heart pounded in my chest, and my stomach was filled with butterflies.

I finally reached the door, inserted the key, and walked out onto the patio, the wind immediately pummeling me. I looked over to the ledge where Neal had jumped, and there she was.

Claire.

She turned around, smiling. Her phone was up to her ear.

“Yes, he’s finally here,” she said to her phone. Her hair seemed to dance in the wild wind. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

I slowly walked up to her, breathing shallow. She looked right at me.

“You’ve proven yourself,” she said to me. “Are you ready to talk to God?”

I nodded. “Y-yes. I am.”

She handed me her phone. I slowly put the phone up to my ear.

Tears began uncontrollably streaming down my face. A blissful feeling ran through my entire body, and I soon became enraptured in pure, unbridled ecstasy. I began to laugh, and laugh, and laugh.

I knew, even as I fell, that I had fulfilled my purpose. And it was beautiful.

1i3yryc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1i3yryc/after_the_fall/,After the Fall,"The room is silent, except for the soft sound of Ethan’s sobs, muffled by the thick blankets that have become a cocoon around him. The light from the window spills weakly across the bed, illuminating the way his shoulders tremble, a man lost in the deepest well of grief. I want to reach out, to comfort him, but the space between us feels vast, as if I were standing on the edge of a canyon and he was miles away at the bottom.

I watch him, not knowing how to cross the distance that’s grown between us, the weight of it pressing down on me. I should feel pity, I should feel sorrow, but instead, I feel something else. Something colder. Guilt. I know the divorce papers are still tucked in the glove compartment of my car, that familiar, suffocating envelope. I’ve hidden them there for months, convinced that if I waited long enough, things would get better. But they haven’t. And watching Ethan now, curled into himself, I wonder if they ever will.

I run my fingers over the surface of the bedside table, stopping on the family photo we took last Christmas. Ethan’s arm around me, smiling, before everything changed. Before the phone call that shattered our world.

Adam’s death feels like it happened just yesterday. I remember that night so clearly. I remember Ethan’s voice breaking on the phone, the tremor in his words as he told me that Adam was gone. I remember his panic, the way he held the phone too tight, like he could hold onto the words long enough to reverse the truth. But even as he mourned his brother, something inside of him cracked wide open—and I was left standing beside him, unable to get through the wall he built between us.

At first, I tried to be patient. I told myself that he needed time. But the weeks turned into months, and the months into years, and I watched him pull further away, drowning in his grief while I stood on the shore, helpless. I kept hoping that one day, he would come back to me. But he didn’t.

I had my own grief to bear. Two months after Adam passed, my aunt Marcy, the one person who had been my second mother, died suddenly of a stroke. It should’ve been me crumbling under the weight of that loss, but I didn’t. I couldn’t. I kept moving. I buried my sorrow, threw myself into my routines, into the things that used to make me feel like me. I showed up to work every day, met friends for lunch, smiled when I needed to smile. I had to. There was no one else to be strong for me.

But where was Ethan? Where was the man who used to hold me when I cried, the man who would call me just to hear my voice? He had disappeared, retreating into the shadow of Adam’s absence, until it felt like there was no room for me anymore. I kept waiting, always waiting, hoping he would see me. That he would understand that I needed him too. But it never came.

I still remember the night I finally realized that it wasn’t just his brother he had lost—it was everything. Friends had stopped calling him. He no longer went to work. The invitation to family events were met with silence. And it wasn’t just his social life that slipped away—he stopped engaging with me, too. I could see it in the vacant way he looked at me across the dinner table, in the long silences we shared in bed. He was there, but he wasn’t.

I remember one Sunday morning, after a particularly long week of pretending I was fine, I went out for coffee with Chloe, a friend I hadn’t seen in weeks. When I came back, Ethan was sitting in the same spot on the couch, staring blankly at the TV. I could tell by the glassy look in his eyes that he hadn’t moved. I wanted to say something, anything—ask him how he was doing, how we were doing—but the words caught in my throat. I wasn’t sure if he could even hear me anymore.

I went into the kitchen to make us lunch, trying to ignore the feeling of suffocating beneath the weight of his silence. It wasn’t just that I was alone in the house; I was alone in the marriage we had built.

Ethan didn’t even ask where I’d been, didn’t notice the time I had spent away from him. I could feel the resentment building inside me. I needed him. I needed him to see that I was still here. That I, too, had lost something. But he couldn’t see it. All I could do was keep pretending.

I kept up my routines, kept socializing, kept going to work. I even went to a family dinner a few months ago and laughed, the sound feeling strange in my ears. It was a brief moment when I felt like the person I used to be, before all of this. But when I came home, Ethan was still sitting in the dark, lost in the same grief that had swallowed him years ago. And I felt a pang of guilt, too—a guilt for feeling so far away from him, a guilt for the moments I had lived without him.

But what was I supposed to do? How could I keep living in a house with someone who couldn’t see me, couldn’t even see himself?

The hardest part is that I stayed. I stayed and waited for him to notice, for him to see that I was still here, that I, too, was hurting. But he couldn’t. And now I realize that I waited for so long that the woman who once loved him has almost disappeared. And the worst part is, I don’t know if he even remembers her anymore.

I’ve already lost so much—Aunt Marcy, the woman who helped shape who I am; the sense of connection I once had with the man I married; the hope that things would ever return to what they were. And now, I feel like I’m losing him too.

The papers in my glove compartment are a cold reminder of how far we’ve come from where we started. A painful truth I’ve been avoiding. But I can’t wait any longer. I can’t pretend anymore. I need to breathe again. I need to be someone else.

The weight of the divorce papers in my car feels suffocating, but they’re the only way I can start to live again. Because I can’t keep waiting for him to find me in the darkness. And I can’t keep pretending that I don’t feel like I’ve already lost him.",1,1737171512.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False
1i3yrco,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1i3yrco/my_eczema_story_routine_and_questions/,"My eczema story, routine and questions","Hello.  I've been following along here for a little while to get some hints.    Here is my info.  Suggestions would be most welcome :)

**My eczema:**   I had eczema when I was a kid but it went away when I became a teen.  Almost the day I turned 40 (four years ago), It came back.    I was prescribed (not all at once) Blistine, (20mg), Protopic (0.1%) for the face, Taro-clobetasol (0.05%) for my scalp, and an unlimited supply of betaderm (0.1%) for everywhere else.  This didn't control it well, so I was referred to a dermatologist. 

Derm got me on Dupixent which I used for most of 2023, but I developed really bad dry and watery eyes so I stopped.   It worked fairly well at the beginning, but then it seemed like it was less effective towards the end.  She then put me on Cibinqo but after the first dose, I had a terrible headache and my pharmacist kinda scared me that it was a pretty serious medication so I refused to take any more.  After this derm tried to get me on an Ox40 inhibitor trial, but unfortunately I didn't qualify after an assessment of severity and coverage.    She wanted to do allergy testing, but my eczema was so bad that she thought it would be hard to find a suitable part of my skin to use.  Derm retired shortly after. 

Two weeks ago, my family doctor just prescribed me Zoryve (.3%) to replace the Protopic.   She talked about at-home light therapy as well.  The first couple of days I started using it, I found it worked really well and I was able to stop using betaderm entirely.  Then about a week later, my eczema came back worse than ever.

  
**My current routine:** Blistine, Mostly daily warm shower.   I shut the door and let it steam up so I don't freeze too much :)  Pat dry, apply Zoryve on my face and bad spots (Maybe 30% of my entire body!).   After about 2m I cover myself in Aquaphor or Eucerin (original).  Wear 100% cotton cloths that were washed in Arm and Hammer unsented laundry detergent.   Ezcema starts to settle down after about an hour.  Before bed, I apply betaderm, wait 2m, and apply Aquaphor or Eucerin (original). 

I would say my diet is above average.  Yogurt, oatmeal, nuts, dried fruits, fruits, veggies, chicken, salads, minimal (bread, pasta and rice).   One coffee a day, no processed foods, no junk food, organic when possible, no alcohol. 

This is where I'm at now: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qbh21fRrmSFL9oRX7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qbh21fRrmSFL9oRX7)

  
**Questions:**

* How long should I wait to add moisturizer after applying the medicine?
* How much better would it be to have a cold shower?  
* Can Zoryze be used more than once a day?  (The prescription says to use daily)
* Are daily showers a good idea?  I feel almost like I rinse some of my allergens away and the medicine and moisturizers absorb better after a shower, but it's hard to say what's best.  
* I understand that sugars are bad.  I gave up all candy/dessert, sweet drinks, etc.. but still eat lots of fruit and dried fruit to get my sweet fix.  Does this still count as sugar? 
* Could some of my more recent issues be betaderm withdrawal?
* Living in a cold climate.  Should I move somewhere warmer? :)

I am 30 y/o, 5’5”, and 200lbs last time I checked. I am a new, first time mom and almost 5 months postpartum. I do not breastfeed anymore; unfortunately, I could not produce enough. I was 165lbs before getting pregnant, but want to be at 130lbs (I lost my way before getting pregnant). I am going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding in November, so I would like to lose SOMETHING before then! I do not and never have eaten vegetables or fish. I hate them. The smell, the taste, the texture, all of it! I rarely eat fruit. My diet sadly consists mainly of carbs, sweets, and meat. I will also admit that I do not drink enough water… my breakfast is a coffee from Starbucks, sometimes forget about lunch, and will usually have an earlyish dinner, so I don’t eat that much. I haven’t worked out in years and it’s been quite the struggle to even move since having the baby. I’ve been trying to eat better, but the scale isn’t budging. My family and friends all know how much I LOVE meat and have all suggested the carnivore diet. I’ve read on it a little and am going to try it out, but still confused on a few things and wondering if it would be worth trying. I don’t have any medical issues; my goal is to lose weight. My current plan is to be on this diet for 30-60 days, but will go longer if I feel it works for me!

I understand I can eat all meat (chicken, turkey, ham, beef, pork), but can I only season with salt and butter? Can I use pepper, onion/garlic powder, any herbs/spices? What about sauces for like chicken wings? Can I eat deli meat, like cold cuts? 

Also, for the dairy, I LOVE milk. I easily drink a gallon of 2% in a week. Can I only drink water now? Can I eat all cheeses?

I’ve read that I will be getting horrible headaches for days.. can I take Tylenol to try to ease the pain?

I want to do this right, so I can get the best results, but need some tips and would love to hear a similar story or if anyone could share their before/after results for motivation, I would greatly appreciate it!

We just kind of clicked, shared a lot of the same future goals and opinions, and I felt like I could be myself. We had fun together and she got me out of my comfort zone a little.

We both work full-time and I am in college part-time. We also live an hour apart and so I’d go to see her on the weekend and sometimes she’d come over Sunday night since she didn’t work on Mondays. She had a conversation with me about how she wants to see me more. I agreed and we planned to see each other at least 3 times a week. Things were okay and a bit later she had a conversation with me on the phone about how she feels like I don’t always care about what she’s saying. I did care but I didn’t always know how to respond to things or know how to feel about things she told me about her difficulties. 

She came over to break up with me and we talked/cried for about 3 hours before she left. She told me that she was hurting and didn’t want to hurt me. She didn’t feel like herself anymore. She said she’d miss me too. 

I just want to highlight some things that went on. She worked at a job where the customers would talk poorly to her, her coworkers didn’t help her out much, and her boss would make sexual comments to her and make her feel uncomfortable. She didn’t want to quit because she wasn’t sure what was happening with her schooling and felt she couldn’t make the same amount of money elsewhere. She was trying to become a pilot but her medical was held up because of therapy she had as a teen. It was on hold for over a year and she’d call weekly about it. Her parents divorced shortly after she was born and she lived at home with her mom, who is part of/most of the reason she was in therapy it sounded like. She didn’t really have hobbies to do by herself and had a friend that she’d meet with for coffee but wasn’t really fond of. I just feel like there was a lot going on.

I’ll admit that I could have been more supportive and maybe a little more there for her emotionally. I tend to suppress my feelings and not talk about things to avoid conflict. Which is an issue I want to figure out. There were things that bothered me in the relationship that I never spoke up about. We would call eachother pretty much every night for 1-5 hours. And it was getting too much for me and felt like it was cutting into my time. I wouldn’t have minded calling her here and there but not every night starting at 8-10pm. I did tell her I needed my alone time but it was in response to her talking about her sister’s bf being at their house every night, not as its own conversation. 

It felt like she relied on me for happiness. When she’d get home from work and we weren’t hanging out, she’d do laundry and maybe get something to eat but then lay on her bed and zone out. It wasn’t good for her. I tried helping her look at new jobs and offered her to live with me for a bit. She didn’t seem too interested.

I texted her a few days after the breakup and told her that I was thinking about her and I was sorry if me reaching out was adding anything to her plate. I said I understand if she needs to take some time for herself or a relationship isn’t a good thing rn but that if she needs someone to talk to, I’m still here for her. She texted a few days later and appreciated the message. She wishes me well in school and success/happiness in life. I told her I agreed with her decision to breakup as it showed me how I needed to work on emotional availability. And I apologized that I wasn’t there for her emotionally as much as I should’ve been. I told her I’m looking at therapy and that I hope both of us can grow as individuals. I told her that enjoying time with yourself, support, and non-toxic environments are essential. That’s she’s an amazing person and I wish her the best. She said she really enjoyed our time together too and apologized for not always communicating effectively with me. She’s proud of me for seeking therapy and prioritizing myself. She ended it saying thanks.

I don’t think I’m going to respond and leave it at that. I want her to be able to heal and work on herself a little as I do the same. I miss her and am worried about her. I would love for us to come back together as healthy individuals in the future, however long away that is. I have been debating getting a pizza to share with her sister’s bf so that I can return a coffee mug of their’s and maybe talk to him about things. Just to make sure he is supportive of her and makes sure she’s doing okay. I very much doubt he’d tell her that we met, if we did.

I shouldn’t get my hopes up about things but I at least think we left on good terms. I should try to move on and live life like I have been, but better. Maybe I’ll wait for her to reach out. Or maybe I’ll reach out in the later summer to make sure she’s doing okay. Also, her birthday is coming up and while I’d like to wish her a happy birthday, I don’t want to overstep.

Any thoughts on the situation?

And moreso, why this unevenness seems to be a trend for people who seem to be along the ""autism, schizoid, ASPD"" disposition you find a lot here.

Everyone’s journey is different. But this was mine. Would love to hear how you’d add to this, from the lens of your own journey x)

1. Pulling yourself together in that ultrasound room will be the most desperate act of strength you’ve ever exhibited. You’ll fight through sobs to stifle the shock. This runaway train is already moving at light speed and decisions on tests and timing need to happen immediately. There will be plenty of other opportunities to break down and fall apart, but right now you’ll need to focus, listen and understand every word on what’s to come.

2. You’ll wonder how 30 mins ago you were tossing around names with your partner in the waiting room, and now doctors are gently bracing you for the potential need for termination. You will choke on your sobs when they share that because of your gestation, doing so may involve a full labour and delivery. No. This can’t be real. You’ll realise you’re in one of those nightmare stories you only read about in books or hear on podcasts.

3. Leaving that room, you’ll turn to your partner and say “I think we just lost our baby” and sob into his hug. He doesn’t realise that that was more of a question than a statement, so you say it again this time more frantically, “I think we just lost our baby, right? Do you agree? Right?”. You desperately hope that he heard something completely different than what I’d just heard and that this was all in my head like a bad dream. Instead, he too breaks down and agrees and together we hold each other and sob on the street.

4. You’ll quickly realise that you’re the type who needs to process out loud. And you’ll be so grateful for everyone who listens. This isn’t so much about venting or getting something off your chest. You’ll find you really need people to catch you because what you’re doing is free-falling. And to do so, they’ll need to be strong. You’ll feel their discomfort as they struggle to find the right thing to say, but none of it will really matter. The only thing that does is that they held you, cried with you and let you talk. 

5. And you will talk. And talk and talk. In circles and spirals. Saying the same words. Telling the same stories. To anyone who will listen. And every time you do, it will be painful but seeing their sorrow mirrored back at you will somehow make you feel lighter. It’s the confirmation you’ll need to know that they’ll carry this with you. 

6. When you have to terminate for medical reasons, you’ll be faced with so many unimaginable decisions. They call it ‘choice’, like you’re being presented with a buffet of delightful options, but really it’s just the illusion of choice. There is no choice. Because you certainly never chose this.

7. Your immediate coping strategy will be to shut down, move through and forget this ever happened. You’ll get the results on the gender, but will forbid yourself from opening the email. Why would you make this journey any harder by allowing yourself to get emotionally invested? You’ll know you need to be smart and act defensively to protect yourself.

8. But that won’t last long. How can you possibly deny that she exists when you can feel her move inside you, you can see her little hands and feet up on the ultrasound screen, and when you’ve heard her heartbeat? There they are again. Poking you and saying hello. And so you cave and look at the gender results. A girl! And the name you discussed in that waiting room instantly springs to mind. Daisy. 

9. You’ll soon find that the pain of putting up walls hurts far more than opening your heart and bonding with her. You’ll surprise yourself with how fast you fall in love. For wanting to collect her ashes, buy her toys, get her handprints. You’ll feel a bit delusional, and judge yourself for how much you’re entertaining her life. For telling yourself that you have two children; one you’ll have to hold and one you’ll never. But you push through the awkwardness. You don’t do it for yourself, you do it for her. Because she deserves to be recognised and remembered. 

10. The nights will be the hardest. When everything is quiet and your to do list slows. When there is no one but you and your baby girl in that moment, you will hold her in your belly and sob for hours until sunrise. While the nights are the hardest, they’re also the most connected.

11. You’ll eventually come to realise that losing her is not a question of if, but when. It shatters you but allows you to shift your focus from chaotic lunatic lady descending into decision spiralling madness to just being her loving mama, being present, going inward and cherishing every moment you can still spend with her.

12. Feeling her move inside you and watching as your body continues to grow will feel cruel, but also comforting. She is still with you, and for now you can still hold her. 

13. Cradling your toddler against your belly at bedtime will simultaneously fill you with so much sadness and joy. Sadness that they’ll never meet and become lifelong friends, but joy that they can have this connection for now. And so can you.

14. You’ll start to see signs from her everywhere. On the illustrations of the craft beers your partner pulls from the fridge. In artist names of the random shuffle Spotify radio songs being served up. In the very lyrics of that song. You’ll receive these as messages from her that she sees us and is holding us as we hold her. 

15. You’ll desperately want to salvage every evidence of her life. Every blood report, every ultrasound image. Any sign that she did in fact exist. You’ll break down when the midwife asks why you so desperately want all of her images and you’ll hear your throat croak “because I think that’s all I’m ever going to have”.

16. You will be fine one moment and the next you’ll find yourself ugly crying into your McMuffin while sitting at the window booth in a cafe called Happyfield. 

17. You’ll experience decision fatigue. TFMR is not just one life changing decision, but rather a cascading set of monumental decisions that you just have no energy for. Which termination method? Should I seek an autopsy? Will I regret never insisting on meeting and holding my baby after termination? Can I really truly even handle that!? The enormity of each decision is heavy. Many need to be made immediately and no one can or will tell you which option is better. Only you can decide. And it’s cruel, because no matter what you decide you’ll lose either way.  You won’t want any of it. And you’ll wonder where’s the option to refuse this reality and go back to one week earlier.

18. Even after you know you’ll have to let her go, you won’t stop advocating for her. Advocating for her in the way she’ll pass. In the way you’ll ask family and friends to pause and beam love her way as she passes. In the way she’ll be memorialized. In the way you’ll ask to address the medical team who’ll handle her. You’ll tell them her name. You’ll let them know that she is loved. You’ll plead with them to show her kindness and love, and by the glassy looks in their eyes you’ll know that they will. All of these conversations will be uncomfortable but it’s not about you, it’s about her. You’ll do it all for her. In time, you’ll come to see these efforts as acts of maternal love. While you’ll never be able to comfort and cuddle her, you can do everything possible to ensure she’s recognized and sent off with nothing but love. These acts will be you stripping your heart and laying it bare and asking people in your life to please be gentle with it. These will be a mother’s desperate pleas on behalf of a daughter she’ll never meet. And you’ll feel grateful to be able to do that, knowing many others don’t get the same opportunities to advocate for or say goodbye to their babies before they lose them.

19. Seeing people honouring her with you will swell your heart with so much love. Hearing friends, families, doctors, therapists all using her name will dignify not only her, but also your grief. They’re acknowledging your loss and understanding that it’s not so much a pregnancy loss as it is the loss of your child. People are so willing to drop everything just to hold your hand and walk this path with you, if you’ll open up and let them in.

20. After you lose her, you’ll start to feel your organs creak and jolt as they come back together. Your belly and boobs will deflate. You will bleed. A body in mourning. Or perhaps all signs that your body is already forgetting she was ever even there. It’ll go through the motions, it’s done this before, but your heart will refuse to simply auto-pilot and move on. 

21. You’ll realise that you don’t know one single person, not one, who has gone through this. This form of baby loss is silent, very very silent. You’ll wish there was someone in your life who you could just go grab a coffee with and cry because you both intimately know what it’s like.

22. In the days following, you’ll find comfort in reflecting on how grief is really unexpressed love that never got to be shared. And when grief can be processed as a form of love, it actually strangely enough feels so good to be released. You’ll begin to see that at the heart of grief, is love.",20,1737170511.0,tfmr_support,7,0.95,False

I don’t remember if I hit my head or back as it all happened so fast but my phone, AirPods and coffee fell to the ground along with me. I got up quickly got back to my destination and made a police report. I talked to my colleagues and they suggested I should get checked as I was complaining of intense pressure in my head. I went to the employee clinic and they referred me to urgent care as results wouldn’t come back quick enough. When I got to urgent care my lower back started feeling very stiff and I had an episode of almost passing out so I quickly grabbed on to my car. At urgent care the PA diagnosed me with nystagmus as I had shaky pupils while conducting a head to toe assessment and strongly suggested to go to ER to get a CT scan done for possible brain bleed scanning/whip flash.  As I’m stubborn (and a broke college student) I decided to go home with an even stronger suggestion to not fall asleep and look for symptoms of brain bleeds (snoring, mood swings, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, etc). I tried to fight my sleep even drank coffee and still couldn’t keep my eyes open until I knocked out, recently woke up but worried I should have just paid the money and gotten to the ER. What are my options here and how worried should I be? I was told to give 24 hours for these symptoms and after it shouldn’t be as risky. Thanks in advanced! ",6,1737170266.0,AskDocs,5,1.0,False

Soda heavy chains like Swig, Sodalicious, & Fizz Drinks could eat into soda traffic. Maybe, maybe not.

Mormons can not have coffee & tea due to their religion enforcing some standard on it. Even the Mormons think it’s dumb. But they have to fall in line.

Pros: Maverik and Holiday are only options close. And they’re not even close.

Vital route connecting Salt Lake City to Denver. Salt Lake City to Las Vegas. 

Exposes the concept of QT to tourists visiting the mighty five National Parks of Utah. People from across the country flock to Southern Utah. 


Final Thoughts (My Opinion): QT will move westwards with RSNs outside of Boise & Seattle. Montana possibly with Bozeman, Billings. Think college towns. Minneapolis area is final frontier that starts to close the gap but puts pressure on Chicago division to expand towards Milwaukee to compete with Kwik Trip. There needs to be more exposure to QT brand to push against Kwik Trip.

California is going to happen. Same with Oregon. But it’s going to be on a super busy truck route. It’s all bullshit they say they won’t go there. Houston and Chicago are the biggest examples. I think end game was to get into most populous cities in US to boost the QT brand much faster. Despite all odds. Here we are. Denver was another example. We went all in on that. All in all, we should be glad we’re about to hit both coasts before Wawa, Sheetz, Racetrac, Kum & Go, Casey’s, and of course Kwik Trip.

This is so frustrating just waiting out this tenure for a couple years as the team atrophies until the program will be forced to start from scratch, especially since we spent 3 or 4 years for them to wake up and smell the coffee on the last guy's futility too.

This slightly above .500 with middle of the pack talent stuff cannot be the standard here. Not that long ago we were in Final Four or bust mode.

They will nit-pick, harass, gossip about, slander, and sabotage the target into eventually rage-quitting.

My last bully was a sad 46 year old woman, very overweight, uneducated, in an unhappy marriage with a bunch of kids, in debt, and had a plethora of health issues. 

She sat around gossiping about people and reporting people for 'using the bathroom too long' or 'making coffee every morning' instead of focusing on her own work. 

She'd get visibly elated when publicly talking down to or humiliating her chosen target. Or when she managed to make another person upset.  Can you imagine deriving pleasure from someone elses pain??

Meanwhile, she demanded constant sympathy and empathy for all HER problems in life. She was allowed to miss lots of work, come in late everyday, and sit around gossiping or on her phone.  But there were different rules for her chosen targets. ",26,1737170196.0,workplace_bullying,3,1.0,False

I have been in an abusive relationship in the past, 10 years ago which I am just now seeking therapy for—as it turns out compartmentalization does not work in the long run, and that shit will catch up to you. 

I guess also the way I phrased it about my sex life with my current boyfriend may have raised some alarms—I do not see or understand his light pressuring in the bedroom to be abuse. Although it has caused stressed and even distress at times and it is something I know we have to work out, and I would love advice, I don’t think it exactly qualifies as abuse. 

That being said, here’s the post, copy pasted from r/relationships. 

My (25f) boyfriend (26m) laughs more with his roomie (23f) than he does with me
TL;DR How do I address feeling insecure about my boyfriend's bond with my best friend, especially when he laughs more with her and seems lighter around her, while our own relationship feels distant and strained?

• He laughs constantly with her—my bestie/his roomie-his energy is just lighter around her. I am: not a drag.
I'm sweet, playful, energetic, caring, and I'm not a try hard. It sounds like l'm bragging, I don't mean to-I just mean to say that people like to be around me. Lately, my man has just seemed tired around me. Like WE'RE the roommates and his actual roommate is his new girl.
• They stayed up late talking and laughing last night while I tried to ignore my feelings of jealousy.
• His shows of agitation sets during serious discussion is a constant. I've asked him 10 different ways to control his temper when we talk about our feelings and he chalks it up to passion (typical Latino) but I can't handle him like that during these already difficult discussions.
I'm in the process of finding therapy for an abusive relationship that ended almost ten years ago, something that l've long compartmentalized. This relationship is the longest l've had since that experience and I want it to be successful. I need him to extend me grace, tenderness, I need him to be gentle with me, but all I get is stubbornness.
• He's resistant to improving small things l've asked for, like showing more appreciation (thanking me for any of the manyyyyy acts of service I do for him daily, some asked and some not-coffee, wash and brush his hair, wash and fold his laundry, do the dishes, tidy his place, massages, pack his lunch, etc.) (and by the way, he does 1-2 acts of service for me per week). Resistant to spending quality time offline, we watch TV basically in silence and go to bed at different times and that's our night every night and I hate it.

-This feels horrible to write out but I'm pretty sure l'm completely dissatisfied with our sex life. I take care of him 1-3X/day, even on my period which I'm not comfortable with but it's like, my duty right? But he gets me off maybe once a week. And he says the most horrible things to me while we're at it, and if anyone has any advice on how to have that discussion, please advise.

• I feel he'd be with her if she showed interest, he doesn't make me feel like his girl at all. While I'm hyping him up all the time, calling him handsome, complimenting his humor and intelligence and style, just looking at him him lovingly now and again— can count on two hands how many times he's complimented me. And it's always
""my beautiful girlfriend"". I know he isn't cheating but this feels just as bad, to tell you the truth. When I asked him what he loves about me he said that I was caring and that I put others before myself, even to my own detriment. I was hurt. He said only two things, both of which serve him/relate to his benefit.
I know some of this is my own insecurity, but I also feel he doesn't show me the same grace, interest, or effort I give him.

How can I navigate this dynamic and share my feelings without pushing him away?

Is his connection with his roommate crossing any boundaries, or am I projecting my insecurities?

How do you know if you see long term potential with somebody?

I'd love your weight on this one: What boundaries or changes might make me feel more secure and valued?

I’m (19F) and have three friends I’ve known since pre-elementary school. I’m an only child, and my family is comfortably middle class. I’ve always enjoyed bringing my friends along for vacations, concerts, parties, or outings, often paying for everything when I could. They were my closest friends, and I didn’t mind supporting them—it was just what friends do. But as we grew older and they made new friends, things started changing. They would stop calling unless they needed something, and I accepted it. I kept inviting them, even when I felt left out or mistreated. I understood when they were upset or acted out, knowing they were going through things. However, over the last semester, I realized how much these patterns were affecting my mental health, so I started pulling back gradually.
A couple of weeks ago, they invited me to lunch, and since I’ve been tight on money with college approaching, I suggested somewhere cheap or using a gift card. They rejected the idea, and I made it clear I’d only pay for myself. I ordered a $20 salad, which they shared, and I didn’t mind. When the bill came, I noticed a $10 charge for tea, which I only had one cup of. I hoped they’d cover it, but they didn’t. Instead, they pointed out that I had some, so I reluctantly paid it. Then, friend 1 loudly complained about the tip, saying he didn’t want to waste money, leaving just a crumpled dollar on the table. The others followed suit, tipping under 5%. I was upset, especially since one of them worked in customer service. I called them out, and friend 1 sarcastically suggested I cover the tip for everyone, which I did because I felt bad for the waitress. He then had the nerve to say he “raised me well.”
Later, as we left, friend 2 called to say he had hit a parked car and left the scene—essentially a hit-and-run. I begged them to go back, but they argued it wasn’t a big deal. Eventually, friend 2 agreed, and I walked with him to the car owners, who were very kind and didn’t ask for insurance details. When we returned, my friends congratulated him, and friend 1 asked why I wasn’t praising him. I said I was glad he took responsibility, but they seemed annoyed. They wanted coffee, but I couldn’t afford it, so they went without me. I haven’t heard from them since.
Now, I was planning a graduation trip to Hawaii for them, but after everything that’s happened, I’m reconsidering. I’m so tired of being let down by these friends who don’t seem to appreciate me. I’m wondering if I should just walk away, or if there’s still a chance to salvage things.

A few weeks ago I was pulled into my HR ladies office (she is above me and basically the rest of the store as well). I basically got in trouble for letting my baristas make their own drinks (after paying for them) and using the restroom before or after my 15 minute break and not during (essentially making it a 20). I was told I was stealing time, allowing my girls to potentially steal from 🎯, and “loafing”. I trained at two separate 🎯 stores and both stores let their baristas make their own drinks, and I truly had no idea that rule even existed. Keep in mind I’m being scheduled as a barista every single day, and also being expected to fulfill my team lead duties for both departments, and doing so rather successfully. No other team lead is expected tk work within their team like I do. We opened with 8 baristas that had ZERO experience in 🎯 or Starbucks and are down to 5 including me.

My mom gave me a DeLonghi EPC (it’s about $130 from Sam’s Club) for Christmas, and honestly, it worked great at first. She also bought me a grinder, but it wasn’t grinding fine enough for espresso, so I decided to buy pre-ground coffee instead. The coffee I’m using now is extremely fine—almost like powder.

At first, everything was going smoothly, and the espresso tasted great. But recently, I’ve started running into a few issues that I can’t figure out. For context:
	•	I’ve ordered a bottomless portafilter (open-face style) that should arrive tomorrow, and I’m hoping it might help with some of these problems.
	•	I’ve read that using a puck screen might be a solution, but I don’t think that should be the main thing preventing my puck from sticking to the group head.

Here are the issues I’ve been having:

Issue 1: Dosing
I know the standard advice for a double espresso is to use at least 14 grams of coffee, but when I dose 14 grams, it completely fills my portafilter to the brim. Because of this, I’ve been using slightly less than 14 grams, but I’m not sure if that’s normal. Is my basket too shallow, or is it common to adjust the dose like this?

Issue 2: Brew Ratio Confusion
I’m struggling with the 1:2 brew ratio. As I mentioned, I dose my portafilter to what feels like a good level—just below the brim after tamping—and this is usually around 10 grams. However, when I pull a shot, I’m getting way more than the expected 20 grams out. I’m seeing about 40–60 grams of coffee in the cup.

Here’s the thing: even though this seems way off, the coffee tastes perfect to me, and I enjoy very very strong coffee. I can’t imagine drinking a proper 1:2 ratio (e.g., 20 grams out) because it seems like it would be too strong (and too little without any of the froth/cream forming) Am I doing something wrong here?

Issue 3: Timing Confusion
I’ve been pulling my shots for about 18 seconds from when the coffee starts dripping into my cup. This usually gives me around 40–50 grams of coffee. From what I’ve read, you’re supposed to pull for 25 seconds (or more) and get only 20 grams of coffee for a 1:2 ratio. I just don’t see how that’s possible.

As mentioned earlier, I’m using pre-ground espresso that’s very fine—like powder—so I don’t think the grind size is the issue. But why am I getting so much coffee so quickly? Is this something to do with my machine or technique?

Issue 4: Puck Sticking to the Group Head
This is the most frustrating issue because, even with the other problems, my coffee tasted fine, and cleanup was easy. Now, after about a week of things working perfectly, my puck has started sticking to the group head almost every single time I pull a shot. It’s making cleanup a pain because I have to clean the machine after every pull.

I thought this might mean I was overfilling the basket, so I tried dosing just 7 grams of coffee (way below what’s normal for a double shot). But even with only 7 grams, the puck still sticks to the group head. At this point, I’m completely confused as to why this is happening.

If anyone has advice, I’d really appreciate the help! I’ve loved learning about espresso, but these issues have me stumped. Thanks!

Eventually she mentioned how we are both in the Art field and that she has this ""business opportunity"" to which she would be more than happy to connect me with some of her ""Entrepreneurs."" That she quit her 9-5 and that its great income.

It felt so weird, because I said nothing to her and she felt way too interested in talking about me and my degree, but I thought why not give her my number and see what it is. So, she called me just a few minutes ago and let me know that her friend who quit her 9-5 wants to connect with me over coffee, and it would take about 30-45 minutes.

Here's where I feel like it's some kind of scheme: She couldn't tell me what business it was, what the work really entails and what they sell. She just kept saying we work with private buyers, we do ecommerce, we work with commodities. She kept saying I had really good questions but that the answers were too long to explain and that its better in person. After all my questions she started changing her tune too, as she went from ""Tiffanie is really excited to meet with you,"" to ""Well I need to see when she can meet, and if you don't think this is for you that's ok.""

Like...I don't know if this is for me because you're not telling me what it is that I would be doing? It sounds like I would be buying things and selling things online?

I stood up on the oversized desk and looked at the oversized mirror. It has been three days since being in the home of this oversized alien. I truly felt like a child. I mean, everything looks like a human bedroom but just about 1.5 times bigger because, well, they are about 1.5 times the size of us. So, being in this oversized room, I feel small, and it just reminds me of being a child back home in my bedroom playing with my action figures.

We are nine light-years away, and here we are on a strange alien planet around a harsh red sun, and these guys have come to the same conclusions we humans on Earth did. I hadn’t really thought about that when I first got here, but the more I think about it, the more amazed I am by it.

First off, they have the concept of a door. A door separates outside places from inside places. They have windows that let natural light into the interior of buildings. They have fruit—which, by the way, tastes like a very sweet peach. They have a mirror. They like to look at themselves in the morning. I suppose they brush their teeth. They don’t have any hair that I can see. They’ve opted for scales instead of skin, which makes sense. Scales don’t leave room for hair, after all.

They don’t communicate with words; they communicate with songs or sounds, and they don’t use their mouths to vocalize. The vocalization comes from their chest, which is hard and shell-like. But I can understand them. Well, I don’t know exactly what they’re saying, but the songs come through, and I can feel what they mean. The songs are very complex. They talk in music—and I know music.

When they’re sad, you can hear the song, and you know it’s a sad song. When they’re excited, the rhythm of the song becomes fast. I can tell when they’re asking a question because the note pitches up at the end of the song. If they’re scared, the song becomes eerie.

I have spent a lot of time just listening to them talk to one another. Oh, and by the way, there are two of them here! I can roughly sense what they’re saying to each other by feeling the music. What is the best way I can describe it? It is like listening to a song in a language you don’t understand—you can still feel what the song is about through its rhythm, beat, and tempo, or through its instrument choice. You can feel it. It’s like ancient music. Think about Mozart, and picture music with no lyrics whatsoever. It still makes you feel like you're having a conversation with the speaker, even though there are no words. That’s how they communicate, but it’s far more complex than the simple vocalizations of small mammals on Earth, as far as we know.

It really makes me think of dolphins. We know dolphins are smart, but what are they really saying to each other? Have you ever seen those feeds of dolphins interacting with small children at the aquarium? I bet those two are having a full-on conversation about what the kid’s lollipop tastes like. You can tell that the kids and the dolphins in those feeds understand one another perfectly, but as adults, we have no idea what’s going on—we just think it’s adorable. But can’t you hear the happiness in the dolphin’s squeals? Can’t you read the expression on the kid’s face? Can a dolphin smile? I really think it can, and I believe a dolphin can read a child’s emotions just by watching them through the glass. In this instance, I am the dolphin, and he is the ‘child.’ I don’t have to try to decipher his language; I can just feel what he’s saying. It’s pretty crazy, I know.

The marines sometimes call them crustaceans, but I have decided that is not true. Amphibian is the closest analogy I can think of. They do have a mouth, but it's for eating, and their teeth are square and flat. Well, I didn’t really get a good look at their teeth. There could be incisors, like we have in the back of our mouths. I say that because they have been bringing me more than just fruit to eat. Their main staple is a type of stew that is out-of-this-world delicious. It has some sort of meat and all kinds of colorful bioluminescent vegetables. Each color has a different flavor, but they are all delicious.

I was afraid to eat anything here at first, but when I awoke, I realized my pack was open, and all my rations had fallen out when I was dragged away by that thing in the swamp. Well, I was hungry and decided I would rather die of some alien food poisoning than starve, but I’m sure glad I decided to eat because, boy, is Riton cuisine amazing! My very favorite dish at home is good old-fashioned chicken noodle soup—just a simple soup with carrots, onions, celery, and whole skinned chicken thighs cooked in savory chicken broth. These guys blow that dish out of the water. I guess they have a better variety of vegetables here. All I can say is, Donatello is one heck of a cook!

I think I mentioned it before, but apparently, there are two aliens living here. The first one I have named Donatello because these guys vaguely resemble Ninja Turtles. The only difference is that sometimes they crawl around on four legs like a dog. That’s only when they want to move fast, but as soon as they get to where they’re going, they stand right up like a human. When they stand, their front… ahhh… paws go limp and stay by their side. Then they have two arms just like us coming out of the front of their chest.

Those arms only have three claw-like fingers, which they use to manipulate objects. The claws are curved inward and have surprising flexibility. I would say they can manipulate things almost as well as we can. It looks like they figured out how to get by without opposable thumbs. I found it fascinating just to watch them. There’s the big one I’m calling Donatello for now because I don’t know what else to call him, and the little one—I’m not sure if it’s a male or a female, but it is definitely a child. It’s pretty shy.

When Donatello enters the room, I can see the little one peeking out from behind the door frame. Sometimes it will scurry onto Donatello's back plate out of sight, crawling around to peek out again. Every time it peeks out from behind him, I smile, wave, and say, “Hello!” When I do that, it gets this really cute expression on its mouth and scurries back behind the big one. It is very curious. Just like human babies, its eyes are much bigger than its head. I have to admit, it’s extremely adorable and if I could put it on my feed I would have a billion credits in like 2 seconds. Unfortunately, I can't do that. First off my implant is busted but even if did quantum physics would get in the way. More about that later!

If Jessica were here, she would be squealing with delight, I’m sure of it. Oh, Jessica. God, I was such an awkward teenager. I should have just walked up and said hi. Man, was I a stupid kid back then.

Non the less, being here has made me question everything I’ve believed since I was a kid. Back then, every day in school—or even just scrolling through the feed—I’d hear the same stories. Space is dangerous, they said. The explorers out there? Constantly fighting for survival.

It’s hard to shake an idea when it’s literally drilled into you like that. But now, standing here in this strange place, I can’t help but wonder: was it ever the whole truth? Before we can understand what I'm talking about we have to go back, way back!

The year is 2353, which makes this the 24th century in the Gregorian calendar. At the end of the 21nd century, we figured out how to fly a traditional airplane from a traditional airstrip straight to orbit. Apparently, we had known how to do this for a long time, but no one ever gave it serious effort. Once we figured that out, we ditched the expensive and unwieldy Musk rockets of the early 21st century.

As soon as it became cheap to go to space, everyone and their mother wanted to go. You can’t blame them—it was new and exciting, and most people, outside of a few astronauts, a few billionaires, and James T. Kirk himself, William Shatner, had ever been there.

Moon tourism was a hit. The main thing people wanted to do was play golf on the moon, obviously. When you're on the moon playing golf, you can really give the ball a good whack, and it goes super far. How far? Well.. I apologize for nerding out, but this was so fascinating that when I was 18 years old I begged my parents to buy me a ticket to go to the moons specifically to play golf. I did my research and learned a lot. 

On Earth, a golfer can hit a ball about 300 yards if they're really good, but the moon has 1/6th the gravity of Earth, so you'd assume that a moon course would be about triple that.  Well, that’s not exactly true because of air resistance. So, does that mean you could hit the ball farther on the moon? Wrong again! Have you ever heard of a thing called the Magnus effect? No, it has nothing to do with chess. Maybe they should have called it the Beckham effect, because when a ball spins on Earth, it creates lift. When a golfer hits the ball on Earth, the lift actually helps the ball travel farther due to the backspin.

On the moon, however, there’s no atmosphere, so there’s no lift. That makes things pretty weird. For instance, a standard driver isn’t much use on the moon. Instead, the rules are a bit different. When you hit the ball with the flat club on a flat plane, you want to launch it at a 45-degree angle, but a traditional driver on a flat plane will not do that. To achieve this, there’s an anti-gravity platform that follows you around and tilts to create the perfect 45-degree ramp for each shot. You also wear special boots that anchor you to the platform so you can swing just like you would on Earth, but at the optimal angle for the moon. After that, it’s all about skill.

So far, the farthest ball hit on the moon using these rules traveled 4,582 yards—2.6 miles! That makes a lunar par 5 about 13 miles long. Playing golf on the moon is a truly amazing experience, and the view of Earth from the course is absolutely spectacular. I’d recommend it to anyone living on Earth to try it just once in their life.

Another great thing about the moon course is that they give you your own moon buggy to chase the ball around. It’s so much fun! A lot of people slice the ball off course, but if it goes out of bounds, you just take a stroke and drop it at the edge of the course—no big deal. It’s not really about the score if you’re not a pro; it’s about the adventure and the thrill of playing golf in a way you never could on Earth. Honestly, it was one of the greatest experiences of my life!

That is, until you get to the casino and realize they freaking built a McDonald’s on the moon and that makes you very, very sad.. Because of course they did. When humanity finds new real estate, the first thing we do is build a golf course. The second thing we build is a McDonald’s and a Starbucks. Then we stand up and yell to the cosmos, “I am man, and I am conqueror of all things holy!” Starbucks really wanted that spot because, well… the pun was too good to pass up.

Of course, there’s also a boring hotel, a casino, and some shopping areas. They have real food too—not lunar food, though. Turns out growing potatoes on the moon is kind of a pain. Not to say it can’t be done, because it can, but it’s not easy. There’s very limited water on the moon, and most of it has to be imported. Sure, melting the ice deposits could be an option, but with the space plane technology, it’s actually cheaper to just bring your own water!

Holy crap I just nerded out on moon golf. But it is a passion of mine so deal with it!

After the moon was thoroughly exploited, humanity decided to continue exploiting the nearby area! There was a whole group of people who lived on the moon and spent months out in the belts, collecting asteroids and reprocessing them into metals. That was when humanity really started getting serious about space. Later historians named this period the Expanse. I know Humans are so creative and lame huh! And then, to top it off,  they did the most cringiest thing ever. Even more cringy than naming the expansion period the Expanse.

You see, the purpose of making all that metal was to build a grand old spaceship—an exploration and science vessel to explore the inner solar system. And guess what they named it? Congratulations, you guessed it. They named it after Gene Roddenberry's very own baby. It was called the *Enterprise Prime*. Because, of course it was. There was no way it was going to be named something else.

Everybody was screaming on their feeds: “Name it the Enterprise!” People were writing to their congressmen. There was even a march. It was embarrassing and ridiculous. Anyway, the ship looked nothing like the one from the show. It was basically a giant rectangle with some utterly useless triangular bits on the sides and an engine strapped to the back face of the rectangle. They *could* have made it just a plain rectangle, but I guess they thought that was plain too ugly.

Anyway, back on Earth, scientists had finally figured out nuclear fission, and the *Enterprise Prime* was equipped with a fission drive. It wasn’t fast—pretty slow, actually—but it was good enough to start exploring our own solar system. Which, to be fair, was pretty cool despite the cringy name and how freaking ugly it was.

Well, I don’t want to get into all the details, but long story short, humanity quickly started exploring all the planets. The only really interesting thing they found, besides learning more about the gas giants, and finding jack-diddly-squat on Mars,  was that Europa has fish in it. A lot of fish.

There’s an entire lake under that ice with all sorts of life in it. We built a massive submarine, plopped it right in there, and scientists have spent their entire careers documenting all the different kinds of fish living under the Europan ice. Unfortunately nobody is allowed to fish there to ""preserve the ecology"" That is non sense I want to fish on Europa. When I was little, I loved fish and wanted to be an exo-marine biologist. But I didn’t think girls would find that sexy, so I joined the marines instead! Close enough, right?

But that is not the interesting part. The interesting part came when the Enterprise Prime reached the Oort Cloud. By then, they had refined the drive, and it was going eight times as fast. What they discovered out there was stranger than anyone could possibly imagine.

Out there, as predicted, were dead, dark, frozen planets, comets, and asteroids. But that wasn’t the only thing they found. Out there, we discovered the first wormhole. It was small and a bit wibbly, but it was definitely a wormhole. At first, they weren’t exactly sure what to make of it. Naturally, they sent a small probe through it, but it simply vanished. They couldn’t track it, they couldn’t communicate with it, they couldn’t control it—once it went in, it flew through and, all of a sudden, poof—it was gone. Then they sent another one through—and it vanished. Then they decided to send a third one through—but it also vanished. Then they finally decided to send a fourth one through- and of course it… vanished. Well, they ended up sending thousands of probes of all different designs, at great cost, trying to figure out how to get a signal back, but they couldn’t figure it out.

Then someone got up the nerve to go through it. That woman was named Amra Voss. Everybody knows this story because it’s taught to everyone in the ninth grade.

She was a research officer aboard the Enterprise Prime. Long story short, she stole a shuttle from the shuttle bay against orders and flew right through—and of course, she vanished. People lost their minds when that story broke. It was the biggest thing that had happened that entire century. For four days, she was just gone. People were saying that she got ripped apart when she entered by the gravitational field. Some said that she had gotten through and couldn’t get back. Some said she could have gotten through but suffered radiation poisoning and died before she could turn the ship around and come back.

However, four days later, her ship was seen flying back out of the wormhole, and it docked with the Enterprise Prime. She was extremely weak, and when they opened the door, they found that her face was badly burnt, all her hair had fallen out, and she had massive black growths all over her body. She had developed cancer faster than anybody had ever seen, and it had spread to almost every cell in her body. But the important thing is that she was alive. She had gone through that wormhole and came back alive and in relatively one piece.

Unfortunately, that is where her story ended, but it is not where the human story of space exploration ended. Before she died, she recounted everything that had happened. She had stolen the shuttle and flown it through the wormhole. She spent two days inside the wormhole. During that time, her body deteriorated, and cancer cells multiplied rapidly and at random. She noticed large black growths forming all over her body, but she soldiered on. When she emerged, all she found was empty space. She had no idea where she was. All she knew was that if she stayed much longer, she would die, and no one would have known that she had made it through. So, she took some quick scans of the surrounding area—wherever that was—and turned the shuttle right back around!.

She experienced excruciating pain on the way back, and it almost killed her. For two days, she flew back through the wormhole and somehow managed to dock with the Enterprise Prime. When she returned, she was barely able to speak, and the doctors could do nothing to save her. She succumbed to her injuries several hours after docking. But before she passed, she managed to say three words: “I made it.”

Luckily, the shuttle had her logs and the data. Surprisingly, the craft itself took no damage while flying through the wormhole. It was only her that received a violent dose of radiation. This became the legend of Amra Voss. They even built a giant statue of her at the world capital, outside of Washington, D.C. (How that became the world capital is a completely different story.) She instantly became a hero—not because she followed the rules, but because she broke them. That’s just how humans are, I guess. We’re a bunch of rebel rousers!

But the scientists knew the solution right away. Just shield the craft from the radiation. They took the logs from the shuttle and wrote a program to automatically fly it back through the wormhole. Then, they added more lead lining to protect the crew cab, and they grabbed some monkeys and started sending monkeys through the wormhole.

Yeah, there were people on Earth who were all upset about this, but my God, man, just sacrifice the damn monkeys for science! A few monkeys for progress? Yes, please! The first few monkeys came back with radiation burns, got cancer, and eventually died. One of those monkeys was named Mike, and the number one hashtag on the feed was #SAVEMIKE. I guess humans haven’t changed in over 400 years.

It was, unfortunately, too late for Mike, who made the ultimate sacrifice, but eventually, they developed a shuttle with enough shielding to get a monkey through with minimal damage. They had to use something more absorbent than lead—for the life of me, I can’t remember what it was. But yes, every monkey came back with cancer. The deal was, they would get an infinite lifetime supply of bananas, so it was all good!

The important thing was that each monkey came back with less and less cancer until the scientists were convinced that it was time.

Yes, the trip was dangerous, but it wouldn’t be fatal because the cancer that came back was manageable. They hadn’t yet figured out the A.M.B.E.R. pods. A.M.B.E.R. stands for Advanced Metabolic Bio-Entangled Retainment. That was something the Tarlaxians gave us. Humans also love to come up with clever acronyms, and ""amber"" is kind of perfect because the substance, when used, is a crystalline yellow color, and the human gets trapped inside it. I’ve personally flown in an A.M.B.E.R. pod when I came to Riton. There’s a dirty little secret about the A.M.B.E.R. pod that no one talks about—but I’ll leave that up to your imagination!

So anyway, the second human they sent through the wormhole was Amra’s sister, Selene Voss. Despite the risks, she traveled through the wormhole. This time, Selene didn’t get sick. She spent five days on the other end trying to figure out where she was. On the fifth day, she figured it out by studying the star she had ended up near. That star turned out to be a red supergiant with exactly twelve planets orbiting it in very specific orbits.

Selene calculated the orbits and, after she got back, scientists went looking for a red supergiant with twelve planets orbiting it. The match came back positive—a red supergiant with twelve planets was spotted 23 lightyears away. So Selene and Amra had traveled 23 lightyears in two days. That system is now named S. A. Voss.

If you had told that to Einstein, he probably would have shrugged his shoulders and said, “Well, that makes sense, I guess.” I like to think he wouldn’t have been that impressed at all, really—just relieved that he was right the whole time!

So after this discovery, the hunt was on for other wormholes in the Oort Cloud. Scientists did go back through that S.A. Voss and explore the solar system there, but they really didn’t find anything that spectacular—just a red giant with a bunch of gas giants and some dead rocks. It was fascinating for the scientists but not particularly useful. They found some new elements, like Isonium. I don’t think anybody really knows if that ended up being useful or not. Nobody really knows. The more interesting part is when we started to find more wormholes in the Oort Cloud.

So, as it turns out, we still have no idea how many wormholes are out there. But we do know how many we’ve found so far. That number is 3 million and some change. We’ve scanned, documented, and categorized over 3 million wormholes. Not all of them are traversable, though. Out of the 3 million wormholes, only 2,455 of them are large enough to fit a ship through. Humans have now visited 2,455 different solar systems, and out of all of those, only one was truly exceptional.

Yes, we found resources. Yes, we found moons with life underneath, like Europa. Yes, we found rocky worlds, toxic worlds, gas giants, and a lot of worlds with some sort of proto-slime living ooze. But what we learned was that all of those systems mostly contained things we already knew about—except for the ooze. In reality, they were mostly the same as Sol. There were different types of stars, planets orbited their suns in various ranges, and there were both rocky planets and gas giants, but there was nothing unique or groundbreaking about any of them.

We found a lot of useless, lifeless rocks and a bunch of space farts. That is, until they found the Tarlaxian Hole. When they found that, it changed everything. Everything from here on out I learned from the late Lt Yoggs my the Goddess bless his soul.

The researcher that went through the hole was Bernard Tarlax. He was the first one to go through, and so he got to name the system. Naturally, he named it after himself. He did a scan and found that the Tarlax system had exactly five planets within the habitable zone of a yellow star. They sent a small shuttle to the inner solar system, and that is when they discovered Tarlax 3. They sent pictures back after doing a flyby, and this got people really excited. There were cities down there and civilization. We were no longer alone in the universe. We had found another civilization, and a mission was launched to make first contact.

First contact did not go as planned, but it was also a hilarious story—and it avoided an interplanetary war! Apparently, the Tarlaxians are not very much different from us. They breathe the same air we do, and their planet has a similar oxygen composition. All in all they are pretty chill dudes.

The human research team that went there first took pictures and left before anyone on the planet noticed. When they came back a second time, however, a low-level Tarlaxian police officer noticed a strange ship parked in what he considered an illegal orbital parking spot. Through the coms, he said in Tarlaxian, “Sir, can you please move your spaceship? I’m going to have to write you a ticket for illegal parking.”

That message got sent through the humans’ universal translator, and when it came on screen, it appeared as though the Tarlaxian had spoken the words in plain English.

The research team was floored. The Tarlaxians weren’t shocked or surprised that humans showed up—they were just like, ""Dude, don’t be rude, this is my spot!""

As It turned out they had discovered us before we discovered them and were having a great debate on whether or not to officially make contact with us. So the Tarlaxian police officer just thought he was speaking to a Tarlaxian but boy was he surprised when he looked up and saw it was human. His words where and I quote. ""Oh, shit!""

They had scanned our radio waves, watched our TV shows, and listened to our news broadcasts. They even watched *Pew Die Die* play freaking video games. They had been observing us ever since the 21st century.

Do you remember reading about how in 2023 there was that great panic about aliens flying over New Jersey? Yeah, that was them! They screwed up, and one of their pilots accidentally left the parking lights on. If you think it caused a stir on Earth, oh boy—you should have seen what happened on Tarlaxia. The poor ensign who messed up? Yeah, they almost hung him!

 Well, they knew so much about us by then that talking with them felt as natural as talking with a neighbor from across the fence. But they also knew that we were pretty dangerous from studying our history, which is why they were so reluctant to make contact with us in the first place. Since we showed up with no guns in our hands,they felt that maybe we could be friends. Really, they didn’t have a choice.

As it turns out, the Tarlaxians have never had a war on their planet, so they wouldn’t have had a chance if we turned hostile against them. It was also in our best interest not to be hostile because they had some interesting toys we were very curious about.

Eventually, that first contact led to trade agreements and an exchange of technology. We put an embassy there, they put an embassy in Washington. We go over there all the time to hang out, and they come over here to hang out with us. Surprisingly, people weren’t scared of them. Their faces are crescent-shaped, and some people started calling them ""moon face.""

Their language is pretty much impossible for us to speak, so everyone uses a universal translator implant, which makes it sound like they’re speaking your language. When a Tarlaxian hears us talk, it sounds to them like we’re speaking their language. They gave us the implant as one of their first gifts.

The only thing we could offer them was our friendship and weapons. They weren’t very interested in weapons, but they were cool with us being friends. We told them that if any nasty bugs came through that wormhole, we would blast the hell out of them and send them packing. In return, they gave us quantum entanglement. We had a general idea about the entanglement principle, but the Tarlaxians had figured it out. They set up the first Entanglement Relay on Earth and taught us how to use it.

It’s really easy to use. You could figure out how to use it in a few weeks if you were trained right. It operates basically as a telegraph, but instead of an electrical signal, it uses an entangled particle. Basically, if you manipulate the particle on one end, the other end is manipulated in the same way. You read the spin on the particle, and you can decode simple text messages. The reason why we couldn’t figure it out was because of the problem of Schrödinger's Cat. Yes, a cat was preventing us from building the Entanglement Relay. The answer happens to be very simple: you just have to be really careful about how you observe the cat when you open the box. You have to observe it at just the right angle, and the angle you observe it at has to be absolutely the same as the observer on the other end. That was the confusing part we couldn’t figure out, but to the Tarlaxians, it was child's play. So basically, we set up a telegraph line, and our leaders could send messages to each other via bat phone.

Well, I mentioned that space is dangerous, which is what all the news media has been telling me since I was six years old. The reason for that is because there are an infinite number of wormholes in our Oort Cloud connecting to an infinite number of solar systems, and people began to get very paranoid that some hostile alien would find our wormhole and come to try and destroy us.

When that little earworm got its way into human ears, we got very paranoid, as the story goes. All of a sudden, massive amounts of budget went into military tech to protect against an invasion that might never happen. It had the side effect of bringing all the nation-states of Earth together under the flag of the United States. We didn’t conquer anyone. At the time, we had control of the Moon and most of the asteroid belt. We had all the power, and the other nations couldn’t keep up. So our president at the time, President Victor Stephens, just decided one day that we would start accepting applications for statehood from any country that wanted in. Eventually, all the countries of the world joined the U.S.

Now we have grown from our original 50 nifty United States to 250 states. That includes the original 50 states, plus Puerto Rico and Guam, the other U.S. territories, and the 195 countries that joined as additional states. It came to a nice round number—not because that just happened to be how the numbers added up. People just got really upset when the number of states didn’t add up to a nice round 50, so there was some horse-trading among the tiny U.S. territories. Those 14 territories decided to consolidate, making the number of world states [250.So](http://250.So), the United States of America doesn’t exist anymore—it is now called the United States of Earth. That makes me a USE marine not a US Marnie. Its a tiny name change but that little letter on the end is a big deal.

They are all just rolled up into one federal government, and the capital buildings had to be redone to accommodate the massive number of congresspeople. But they all flock to Washington to wet their beaks. All in all, things were going pretty smoothly on Earth, according to the higher-ups. The stock market went up, billionaires became trillionaires, blah blah blah, as the story goes. But that military budget kept growing every year, and the defense fleets, Navy, Army, and Marines grew by 1000 times. Oh yeah,, there used to be something called a Space Force, but no, the Navy took over that job and they got rid of that stupid Space Force crap. It was basically the same skill set anyway, except in space!

The hardest part about the Navy and space was figuring out how to drink coffee in zero G. This was a huge problem until the Tarlaxians gave us artificial gravity and artificial anti-gravity. In exchange, we gave them coffee. Tarlaxians freaking love coffee.

But that is when shit really hit the fan. 

**A note from the author:**

**Dear reader,**

**This part would normally be continued however I have not written it yet. I hope you enjoyed it. As of right now I have reached a milestone. We are now over 20,000 words taking up the space on over 50 pages. So it is at this time I would like to pause for a moment and fill you in.** 

**I know this is a departure from the tone of the rest of the book. However, since Jay has finally got a chance to take a breather from his adventures I thought this would be a great time for him to reflect and give the reader some backstory to all the random characters and events  I am trying to create with this series. I do have a solid picture of how I want everything to turn out. Maybe one day I will take this chapter and fill it out in the style of the rest of the book but right now that seems to be beyond the scope of me posting updates to this story on HFY. However, I think it's important, in the meantime, that you get the full picture. So this chapter sort of breaks the fourth wall a bit but I think it's necessary for you to understand the greater picture of this very specific and personal story about Jay and his interactions with Riton.  The juicy part, and the point of this chapter will be featured in the next part. I'm sorry about moon golf. It was something that I started to research and it was super fascinating so I went crazy on it.** 

**Please, as always, comment, like, and subscribe. I would really appreciate feedback on my writing. This is my first true writing project, and I’m doing it at various rest stops as I work as a truck driver. This is my 4th year as a truck driver and It has really taken a toll on my mental and physical health.  This has become a hobby in my off time to stave off loneliness, boredom, and depression. So far, it has greatly improved my mental health. It’s nice to focus on something other than just watching YouTube, playing video games, or browsing other questionable subreddits and eating questionable food at rest stops \[see chronicles of the traveler for details\]  that are not HFY.**

**Thanks again! See you later. I also want to thank** ***ItsDirector*** **for his amazing series** ***Chronicles of the Traveler***\*\*. **After reading that, I was inspired to start this project.**

**As always if you or anyone you know is experiencing mental health issues and you live in the states call 988.** ",3,1737168896.0,HFY,2,0.8,False

New VP client over team of 300 junior/ midlevel employees and 50 consultants- mostly senior 

VP is a woman, person of color, hired as a secretary 40 years ago, now is a VP.  No college- just client company experience 

Attitude publicly speaks to people-focus- work/life balance, psychological safety, positivity, religion 

VP treats my team (as well as many members of her own team) like second class citizens but is genuinely confused when people see that- doesn’t understand why people were upset she decided to move their cubicles around - from cubes with great views to cubes near the front door with no windows- because it’s a shorter walk to her office for them - no discussion, just “I saved them steps walking to my office!”  

(It is not common that they need to meet in her office)

But today, she moved some very senior (client) directors around- simply said she doesn’t want Jane (division director client) to have a corner office- wants Jane to sit in the middle office down the hall.  Is thinking a lead executive assistant and junior secretaries should share the corner office because she wants the team near her.  Jane is humiliated and it’s concerning my on-site team in that division 

She’s equally dismissive of me, not recognizing me as the owner of my company, asking who she needs to go to if she has a problem to escalate.  Can’t quite understand how it works, so presumes I’m not the president.

Had meetings with other client directors this week and all expressed the same-  “it’s not you, it’s her, but that’s how she is, so I’m just acting like it’s normal.”  “Thanks to your team for creating slide decks.”

My plan for next week is to arrive at 6am each day to have coffee with her and try to get empathy from her to see people as individuals who can make her successful - my concern is that she’ll respond well but then not notice she’s stabbing me in the back.  Vibe is that she doesn’t want any advice, “just do what I ask.”

1i3x8z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1i3x8z6/espresso_roast_vs_dripfilter_roast_again/,Espresso Roast vs. Drip/Filter Roast (Again!),"I am going to reopen this question which was discussed 8 months ago in the following thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1czt2pm/espresso\_or\_filter\_roast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1czt2pm/espresso_or_filter_roast/)

I previously thought, agreeing with some of the writers on that post, that there really is no ""espresso roast"" that is different than a ""filter roast."" With that assertion comes the idea that the roaster will state what their company thinks would work best for that particular bean but that is not a definite answer for everyone. What I have come across since that time is that some roasters will treat the same bean two different ways--one way for drip preparation and a different way for espresso. For example, the  Oregon roaster Coava states, on its website:

>We roast two development profiles; one is for **espresso** and the other is for **drip**. Espresso is a unique brewing method that produces a concentrate and therefore needs a roast that tones down the acidity, allowing the full taste profile and balance of that coffee to shine and taste its best in an espresso format. We use the term 'drip' to categorize all other brewing methods that produce a dilution. This profile is great for anything from a home coffee pot to an AeroPress. 

Quote comes from: [https://coavacoffee.com/roasting](https://coavacoffee.com/roasting)

That company gives us the option for each of its varieties to choose espresso or drip. I see that another Oregon roaster, Great North Coffee, also gives that option for some or most of its varieties. Most roasters, however, do not say that they sell the same beans with a choice of roasting style. More often, they will simply designate a particular variety for espresso bean, or drip, or make no recommendations at all.

I know that some people feel that an espresso roast means that it is a darker roast. I don't think that is the case because sometimes a medium or even a lighter roast may be designated as an espresso bean by the roaster.

This topic came up because I bought a bag of a Nicaraguan coffee from Coava for use with my Brikka pots, and based on their instructions, I chose the drip option. Coava did not specify a roast level on its website but, by looking at the bean, I would think that it is either medium or medium-light. What I found was that the result was way too acidic for me. After many years of drinking exclusively dark roasts I have been wanting to get into medium and light roasts, after having some superb lighter espresso drinks at local cafes. Based on my experience with this Nicaraguan bean, I definitely plan to specify ""espresso"" next time I buy a medium or medium-light bean. I think that the Brikka (and probably also the Moka) concentrates the acidic taste of a bean that may already have at least moderate acidity.

I know that people often say it's best to stick with medium-dark to darker roasts with Moka and Brikka, but I'd like to see if I can make it work with lighter roasts too, and I want to hear what other people think about this topic.

Earlier in the day, they talked with people in the community, many of whom were familiar with both of them. Later, the two friends walked over to a coffee shop to enjoy a cup while discussing their plans regarding the Subway Line, and the Ministry of Transportation. As the time came for them to make their scheduled appearance, they walked over to Albert Campbell Square, close to the nearby Scarborough Town Centre. Together, they posted some signs around the event site as visitors filed in. When hundreds of people gathered, Raymondl810 made his way to the podium and began his speech.*

“Good afternoon Scarborough! Thank you so much for your time today. It’s wonderful that my colleague Zetix026 and I have the opportunity to speak with you, as there is much for us to share.

Scarborough stands as a region underserved by reliable rapid transit. We started with an aging elevated RT Line that metaphorically and literally went off the rails, but what is our plan for the future? The first is the Eglinton Crosstown LRT. That was certainly a disaster. 5 years off the original opening date, with no opening date in sight, we’re just staring at the unused tracks at our feet wondering what went wrong.

This line is expected to serve Scarborough, but the question of when it will enter service still remains. While Liberal MPs spent the last half-decade pointing fingers at the Ontario Provincial Government and transportation agency Metrolinx, for legal issues. Sadly, this is all they do. They point at the opposition or other governments for issues that have some connections to them. If they adopted a mindset to take initiative and recognize mistakes, then our country wouldn’t be in the crisis she is in now.

This means it’s time to look into the future. We have a project in front of us, one expected to bring options for people in Scarborough. We have seen the great, the not-so-good, and the downright terrible, It’s time to look at other countries’ great infrastructure projects to recognize the steps we need to take.

Thankfully, much progress is already being made. Exactly one year ago, TBM(Tunnel Boring Machine) named Diggy Stardust was lowered underneath our feet to commence on the project. I have much hope for it, but with our incumbent Liberal Government, I can only hope as to how much they truly care about bringing this much needed option.

During the Speech from the Throne, the Prime Minister talked a lot about sustainability. This will present the perfect opportunity to make commutes sustainable, as it gives people options. Options like these allows for cars to get off the road, the **proper way to reduce emissions.**

This 2nd Parliament has quite a few interesting people to be part of this. Most of all, if nobody else comes out to assist and keep the project on the rails, my party and I will be here. If Mr. Trimble fails to hold a high standard, like he demonstrated today, stand out loud so all 16 Liberal-NDP MPs recognize that they can’t act like slugs in the House. We don’t need children who snuggle tight in the protection of walls in their homes to lead crucial projects like these. Scarborough, this is for you, for the People! I'd like to introduce onto the podium, my colleague Zetix026.”",2,1737166463.0,cmhocpress,0,0.75,False
