And all of which are empty words without any weight, a glance or a simple look
Stringing me with your chosen words? Three sixty-five for me to ask is what it took
Did it mean anything for you? If not, I‚Äôll set it aside on the corner of my coffee nook

Truth be told, this is not a demand or an ultimatum
For in life, this is what most people refer to as the ‚Äúbare-minimum‚Äù
In a repeating motion, back and forth like a silent pendulum
In literary form, deprived of any insight into oneself or without speculum

Trapped in a box and just acted out a scene, like a performer who only does mime
Three sixty-five without even a phone call and when I asked, it felt as if I had committed a crime

To M,

I sent it to you last night, and what you said about it was partly correct. It is deep and very real, but not a little sad. Because while I was writing it, I felt again all the hurt from every form of disrespect you‚Äôve done to me. I just wanted you to know that I truly forgave you when you said sorry, and we both agreed not to stress about it anymore.

Now, I just need time to forgive myself. To look back at this post without being in that same state. To forgive myself for all the things I tolerated just to keep our connection intact.

I‚Äôve come to terms with the fact that I can never hate you. I‚Äôm still here, patiently waiting for the day when we can finally share the dumplings we both crave. Please don‚Äôt ever forget this, okay?

What I feel for you has never changed.

Been at bench plateau for a couple months. Max around 145-150 kg.

I have been eating impeccably well (red oily fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grain foods, some dairy (milk with cereal, coffee, cheese), no processed foods really), very little alcohol.

I have not been taking supplements but realize maybe I need to up protein intake. Today started taking one scoop whey protein and 5g creatine, so we'll see what that does.

I thought I had been training well, twice a week chest with heavy and lighter day, good volume and accessory work like dips including ring dips, incline barbell, paused presses, spoto press, Larsen press, close grip, lot of shoulder (including ohp) and back work as well, and triceps, very good mix of unilateral and bilateral exercises, good leg and core workouts.

Nonetheless the plateau.

Hence Bilbo.

My Bilbo set today was 72.5 kg (about 50% max). I did 30 reps, felt like I had at least 3-6 in reserve). Then 100 kg 10x, then 110 kg 9x, then 115kg barely 7x.

During my plateau I can't do 120 kg more than 6-7 times. I can usually do 110 10x. Today I see that had I tried 120 kg, I would have likely maxed at 5.

Is this because of fatigue from the Bilbo set then the other sets?

I did good warmup and stretches. Did the elastic band exercises shown in the Bilbo video.

Anyway, trying to understand today's results in context of my current plateau.

Thoughts?

# Category 1: Projects that Integrate Machine Learning (Addressing your math fear practically)



These projects allow you to use pre-built machine learning models from Apple's Core ML framework, so you don't need to build a neural network from scratch. You'll be using the¬†*results*¬†of the math, which helps you see its practical application without getting bogged down in the theory.

* **Plant Identifier:**
   * **The Idea:**¬†An app where you take a picture of a plant, and it tells you what kind of plant it is.

      * **Core ML:**¬†You'll use a pre-trained image classification model. This shows you're comfortable with modern, powerful frameworks.
      * **Camera API:**¬†You'll work with the device's camera to take photos.
      * **User Interface (UI):**¬†You'll design an interface to display the results and show the user what they've identified.
* **On-Device Object Detection:**
   * **The Idea:**¬†An app that can identify and label objects in real-time through the camera's live view (e.g., ""cup,"" ""laptop,"" ""phone"").
   * **What it demonstrates:**
      * **Real-time Processing:**¬†You'll be using Core ML to analyze the camera feed continuously.
      * **Performance Optimization:**¬†You'll have to consider how to keep the app running smoothly without draining the battery.
      * **CV (Computer Vision):**¬†Shows an understanding of how to use a major subfield of AI.



# Category 2: Projects that Demonstrate Advanced Features (Showcasing depth of knowledge)



These projects go beyond a basic to-do list and show that you can work with more complex, integrated systems.

      * **Spatial Computing:**¬†An understanding of how to work with the virtual and physical world.
      * **Graphics and User Interaction:**¬†You'll have to handle 3D rendering and intuitive user controls.



# Category 3: Projects that Solve a Specific Niche Problem (Demonstrating creativity)



These projects show that you're a problem-solver who can think outside the box.

* **Study Time & Focus Timer:**
   * **The Idea:**¬†A productivity app with a unique twist, maybe a ""digital garden"" where a virtual plant grows as you stay focused, and withers when you use your phone for other things.
   * **What it demonstrates:**
      * **Gamification:**¬†You'll be using game-like elements to motivate users.
      * **Notifications and App State:**¬†You'll need to handle push notifications and track the app's state in the background.
      * **User Psychology:**¬†Shows an awareness of how to design an app that truly helps users.
* **Local Food/Coffee Shop Reviewer:**
   * **The Idea:**¬†An app that lets you review local, independent shops. It could use a unique rating system or focus on a specific aspect like ""best coffee for studying.""
   * **What it demonstrates:**
      * **API Integration:**¬†You'll use a public API (like Yelp's or Google Places) to find shop information.
      * **MapKit:**¬†You'll use Apple Maps to display locations and help users navigate.
      * **Database and User-Generated Content:**¬†You'll need a backend (like Firebase) to store user reviews and photos.

As fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is ‚Äúonly the beginning,

Trump, deep in his delusions about his ability to bully foreign governments, is figuratively banging his head against a wall. For six months he has been threatening tariffs, raising tariffs, then reducing tariffs, then changing his mind about tariffs and who should be taxed. He has been bouncing around like a chihuahua on crack with our three largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, and China, thus throwing the world economy into total confusion and driving them to seek new partners with which to trade; he has driven China even closer to Russia and North Korea.

He is finding out the hard way like a schoolyard bully, that when you try and smack someone, they smack back. And the world is smacking back. He announces trade deals like the one he says he has with Japan. It is not a trade deal, it is a capitulation the will negatively impact American families to the tune of 1,500 dollars a year.

It also turns out the 'trade deals' he has announced as accomplished are not 'deals', at all. They are frameworks for deals. Frameworks then will be changed, negotiated, altered, and compromised over the next year, or so. He tells us they are finalized, but, as usual, he is lying through his store bought teeth.

He will say anything, do anything, blame anyone to hide his incompetence, and real, educated economists and businessmen tell us to fear for the worst.

Trump and as he and his crime family now rake in personal billions while the American economy quivers and quakes with every manifestation of his cognitive fog.

Only the beginning': Business leaders warn of Trump-induced economic crash

Story by Alexander Willis

2 min read

¬© provided by RawStory

As fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is ‚Äúonly the beginning,‚Äù and that the impacts of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are already well underway, Politico reported Friday.

‚ÄúInflation and price increases are coming,‚Äù said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, speaking with Politico. ‚ÄúLayoffs have already been occurring, and supply is going to be lower as we head into the holiday season. These are all happening.‚Äù

Trump unveiled the latest tariff rates on Thursday, set to go into effect on Aug. 7, with tariff rates as high as 50% on major trading partners. Among countries hit with the top rate of 50% is Brazil, with imported Brazilian coffee representing 33% of all coffee consumption in the United States.

‚ÄúI think most people believe wholeheartedly that the impact of these tariffs is going to be felt in the months ahead,‚Äù Ahearn said. ‚ÄúAnd the reason why is that production and manufacturing and the goods as they flow through the supply chain takes time.‚Äù Another cause for concern among business leaders was the unpredictable nature of the tariffs, with among the United States‚Äô largest trading partners ‚Äì Canada, China and Mexico ‚Äì still negotiating with Trump as of Saturday, just days before tariffs are set to take effect.

Doubt also exists among business leaders regarding countries that Trump has already reached a trade agreement with many of which are only verbal or exist solely on a single letter, with no clear commitments from both parties.

Trump, deep in his delusions about his ability to bully foreign governments, is figuratively banging his head against a wall. For six months he has been threatening tariffs, raising tariffs, then reducing tariffs, then changing his mind about tariffs and who should be taxed. He has been bouncing around like a chihuahua on crack with our three largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, and China, thus throwing the world economy into total confusion and driving them to seek new partners with which to trade; he has driven China even closer to Russia and North Korea.

He is finding out the hard way like a schoolyard bully, that when you try and smack someone, they smack back. And the world is smacking back. He announces trade deals like the one he says he has with Japan. It is not a trade deal, it is a capitulation the will negatively impact American families to the tune of 1,500 dollars a year.

It also turns out the 'trade deals' he has announced as accomplished are not 'deals', at all. They are frameworks for deals. Frameworks then will be changed, negotiated, altered, and compromised over the next year, or so. He tells us they are finalized, but, as usual, he is lying through his store bought teeth.

He will say anything, do anything, blame anyone to hide his incompetence, and real, educated economists and businessmen tell us to fear for the worst.

Trump and as he and his crime family now rake in personal billions while the American economy quivers and quakes with every manifestation of his cognitive fog.

Only the beginning': Business leaders warn of Trump-induced economic crash

Story by Alexander Willis

2 min read

¬© provided by RawStory

As fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is ‚Äúonly the beginning,‚Äù and that the impacts of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are already well underway, Politico reported Friday.

‚ÄúInflation and price increases are coming,‚Äù said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, speaking with Politico. ‚ÄúLayoffs have already been occurring, and supply is going to be lower as we head into the holiday season. These are all happening.‚Äù

Trump unveiled the latest tariff rates on Thursday, set to go into effect on Aug. 7, with tariff rates as high as 50% on major trading partners. Among countries hit with the top rate of 50% is Brazil, with imported Brazilian coffee representing 33% of all coffee consumption in the United States.

‚ÄúI think most people believe wholeheartedly that the impact of these tariffs is going to be felt in the months ahead,‚Äù Ahearn said. ‚ÄúAnd the reason why is that production and manufacturing and the goods as they flow through the supply chain takes time.‚Äù Another cause for concern among business leaders was the unpredictable nature of the tariffs, with among the United States‚Äô largest trading partners ‚Äì Canada, China and Mexico ‚Äì still negotiating with Trump as of Saturday, just days before tariffs are set to take effect.

Doubt also exists among business leaders regarding countries that Trump has already reached a trade agreement with many of which are only verbal or exist solely on a single letter, with no clear commitments from both parties.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a business and you‚Äôve got global supply chains and you‚Äôve got to make investments, it really matters that some countries are still in negotiations and certain countries are not in negotiations,‚Äù said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz, speaking with Politico.

‚ÄúWhere are Mexico and Canada gonna end up? We seem to know Vietnam, but do we really know Vietnam? It‚Äôs not clear yet.‚Äù

They‚Äôre warm, generous, and mean well. But I honestly don‚Äôt enjoy visiting them, and I often come back feeling mentally drained.

They live far away, so when my partner (31M) and I visit, it‚Äôs usually for the whole weekend. Everything there is done together: coffee, meals, activities. There‚Äôs very little room to just do your own thing or take a break. If I ask for something simple like a glass of water instead of coffee (especially on hot days), I get comments like, ‚ÄúBut we have other things, you know.‚Äù Yes, I know. I just want water. These kinds of remarks seem small, but they make me feel judged for making basic personal choices.

Their routines are also really strict. I usually shower in the evening not super late, just when I‚Äôm done with the day. They all shower right before bed. So if I shower ‚Äútoo early,‚Äù it‚Äôs seen as strange. If I shower later, like after coming home from a party, I‚Äôm told I woke someone up even though I try to be super quiet and fast. 

I‚Äôve talked about this with my partner. He agrees that his parents are overly rigid and traditional about how things should be done in their home. But he still feels like I should just go along with it because we‚Äôre only there a few times a year.

The thing is, I really don‚Äôt look forward to going there anymore. I like his parents as people, but being in their house makes me feel like I constantly have to suppress my own needs and just play along. That‚Äôs exhausting, even if it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly a weekend.‚Äù

So‚Ä¶ AITAH for not wanting to visit my in-laws because their strict routines make me feel unwelcome and controlled, even though they‚Äôre technically being ‚Äúnice‚Äù?

Here‚Äôs why:

He constantly makes lame jokes and tired puns, elbowing me to laugh at things I don‚Äôt find funny. Even sometimes verbally urging ‚Äúcome on, OP!‚Äù I used to just ignore or keep a straight face. Since they continued, I have finally said myself, ‚ÄúI just really don‚Äôt like puns.‚Äù Boyfriend confirmed ‚Äúyeah, she‚Äôs not crazy about them.‚Äù Still, he continues, and now even jokes about the fact that I don‚Äôt like puns (e.g., introducing me to family by saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do puns in front of her!‚Äù). He has started explaining the pun as part of the bit.

He‚Äôs also intrusive in a way that‚Äôs hard to explain but consistent. For example, we don‚Äôt normally go over after work, but one evening we did. I was tired and emotionally raw after caring for a patient who reminded me of my father (I‚Äôm in healthcare). He asked, ‚ÄúDid you have a tough day at work?‚Äù‚Äîseemingly kindly, but it felt like a boundary overstep. I value emotional privacy and didn‚Äôt want to unpack my day with someone I don‚Äôt feel close to. I just said I‚Äôm a pretty quiet serious person.

He also offered me a drink (nice gesture), but I declined because I had to be on unit at 7am. His response: ‚ÄúDo you know what a stick in the mud means?‚Äù That kind of comment just makes me shut down.

Another time, I mentioned my dad enjoying the decor and dishes at a restaurant we took them to‚Äîbecause it reminded him of his time studying abroad. BF‚Äôs dad replied, ‚ÄúI bet he studied a broad.‚Äù Not the end of the world, but it felt disrespectful and dismissive.

Physically, he can be intrusive too. While I was playing with the grandson, he came up from behind into my space and mimicked what I was doing. I asked, ‚ÄúDo you want to do this part?‚Äù (thinking maybe he wanted grandpa time), and he just shook his head no and walked off. So it wasn‚Äôt about engaging‚Äîit felt more like inserting himself into whatever I‚Äôm doing. 
There was a time when we were on opposite ends of the coffee table and I moved to walk towards the kitchen, he mirrored my action and again when I switched routes. I‚Äôm sure it was an effort to be funny, but it made me anxious.

Sometimes I can even see BF‚Äôs mom holding him back when he‚Äôs about to say something at my expense. He tries to connect toward the end of visits, but by then, I‚Äôve emotionally tapped out. 

My boyfriend is supportive and has communicated a bit with him, but clearly it hasn‚Äôt made much of a difference. I‚Äôve only directly addressed the puns, not the other behaviors. It‚Äôs been over a year since I‚Äôve met the parents and I am at a loss.

TL;DR:
BF‚Äôs dad constantly makes unwanted jokes, crosses emotional and physical boundaries, and doesn‚Äôt seem to pick up on body language. I‚Äôve only addressed my dislike of puns directly, but I‚Äôm increasingly uncomfortable during visits. What are some ways to clearly and respectfully communicate discomfort about these when subtle cues aren‚Äôt working?",0,1754229630.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

Only the beginning': Business leaders warn of Trump-induced economic crash

Story by Alexander Willis

As fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is ‚Äúonly the beginning,‚Äù and that the impacts of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are already well underway, Politico reported Friday.

‚ÄúInflation and price increases are coming,‚Äù said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, speaking with Politico. ‚ÄúLayoffs have already been occurring, and supply is going to be lower as we head into the holiday season. These are all happening.‚Äù

Trump unveiled the latest tariff rates on Thursday, set to go into effect on Aug. 7, with tariff rates as high as 50% on major trading partners. Among countries hit with the top rate of 50% is Brazil, with imported Brazilian coffee representing 33% of all coffee consumption in the United States.

‚ÄúI think most people believe wholeheartedly that the impact of these tariffs is going to be felt in the months ahead,‚Äù Ahearn said. ‚ÄúAnd the reason why is that production and manufacturing and the goods as they flow through the supply chain takes time.‚Äù Another cause for concern among business leaders was the unpredictable nature of the tariffs, with among the United States‚Äô largest trading partners ‚Äì Canada, China and Mexico ‚Äì still negotiating with Trump as of Saturday, just days before tariffs are set to take effect.

Doubt also exists among business leaders regarding countries that Trump has already reached a trade agreement with many of which are only verbal or exist solely on a single letter, with no clear commitments from both parties.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a business and you‚Äôve got global supply chains and you‚Äôve got to make investments, it really matters that some countries are still in negotiations and certain countries are not in negotiations,‚Äù said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz, speaking with Politico.

‚ÄúWhere are Mexico and Canada gonna end up? We seem to know Vietnam, but do we really know Vietnam? It‚Äôs not clear yet.‚Äù

This cold brew coffee maker has made my mornings (and sometimes afternoons) significantly easier by simplifying the brewing process. The way it delivers smooth, low-acid coffee concentrate with minimal effort left me impressed from the very first use.

**Design and Portability**

This product caught my eye immediately with its sleek black design and compact dimensions of 9.53‚Äù x 9.53‚Äù x 14.72‚Äù. It sits neatly on my countertop, occupying less space than anticipated. Even better, it combines elegance with practicality. The borosilicate glass carafe, thoughtfully marked with measurement indicators, makes portioning feel effortless. Also, the detachable components come apart easily, making cleaning an absolute breeze. It's one of those small but meaningful touches you start appreciating after daily use.

**How It Works: A Simplified Process**

Unlike some other cold brew systems that require manual guesswork, the Rainmaker feature evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds like tiny droplets of rain. I‚Äôll admit, I was skeptical about how much difference this would make, but it has consistently provided balanced and rich flavors. The simple switch to begin the filtration process is smooth to operate. And here‚Äôs a brilliant feature‚Äîit halts entirely when the carafe gets removed, ensuring no spills or mess on busy mornings.

[Check OXO 1272880 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b00jvsvm36/)

**Pros**

- The fine stainless-steel mesh filter is reusable and easy to clean, saving money in the long run compared to single-use filters.
- Silicone-stoppered carafe maintains the freshness of concentrate even after days in the fridge.
- Optional paper filters are available if you prefer an extra polished cup.
- Excellent low-acid brewing perfect for sensitive stomachs or cold brew enthusiasts.
- Can also double as a tea brewing tool for versatility.

**Disadvantages**

- Assembly requires some minor work, which might confuse first-time users.
- It doesn‚Äôt feel entirely childproof‚Äîone curious nudge and there goes your coffee!
- Brewing takes an overnight steeping period, so it‚Äôs not ideal if you‚Äôre in a rush.
- The carafe is sturdy but prone to smudges if not cleaned often.

**Strengths**

The versatility of this coffee maker is what truly won me over. It‚Äôs not just limited to coffee; its ability to brew tea felt like a bonus I didn‚Äôt know I needed. The portion control using the stopper? Genius. My coworkers kept raving about how fresh the coffee stayed, even after a few days. By comparison, previous methods I used‚Äîlike steeping in jars‚Äîweren‚Äôt as efficient or clean. Another thing, the whole system nests neatly for storage, which spared me a headache when reorganizing the kitchen cabinet.

**Weaknesses**

Although the product is fantastic in its primary function, its manual operation mode might deter those who find joy in automation. It‚Äôs not exactly flashy or modern-looking compared to some high-end electric brewers. Also, while the mesh filter is reusable, it requires a bit of extra care as residue builds up faster than I anticipated, especially with fine coffee grinds. Lastly, there‚Äôs no included travel cup or carafe lid for on-the-go lifestyles, limiting its immediate portability.

**Alternative Products**

Comparing this model to others like the Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Pot or the Takeya Deluxe model, it‚Äôs clear the OXO provides superior flavor consistency due to its Rainmaker feature. The Mizudashi lives up to its reputation for simplicity, but its plastic design doesn‚Äôt feel as robust. Takeya shines with portability but lacks the high-performing stainless-steel filter that sets the OXO apart. If brewing exceptionally smooth concentrate is your priority, this coffee maker wins hands-down.

**Price Performance**

After using it religiously for weeks, it‚Äôs clear that this cold brew coffee maker delivers exceptional value for its price. While there are cheaper options for cold brews out there, you often trade quality and ease of use for affordability. With its premium materials, reusable features, and intuitive brewing mechanism, the investment feels justified. You get what you pay for: rich coffee, reduced waste, and zero hassle storage.

(And How to Do It Respectfully),"Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîasking someone out can feel like trying to parallel park in front of a patio full of people. Nerve-wracking, awkward, and full of second-guessing.

But here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs normal to feel nervous. You‚Äôre putting yourself out there, and that takes guts. Whether you‚Äôve been out of the game for a while or you‚Äôre just overthinking every word (we‚Äôve all been there), here are a few ways to make the ask feel a little more human‚Äîand respectful:

üí¨ Be clear, not creepy. A simple ‚ÄúI‚Äôve really enjoyed our conversations‚Äîwould you like to grab a coffee sometime?‚Äù goes a long way. No games, no vague invites that sound like a business meeting.

Respect the vibe. If they seem unsure or say no, take it with grace. Rejection isn‚Äôt a reflection of your worth‚Äîit just means it‚Äôs not the right fit.

Pick the right moment. Asking someone out in the middle of a stressful day or when they‚Äôre distracted isn‚Äôt ideal. Find a chill moment to bring it up.

Be yourself. You don‚Äôt need a cheesy line or a perfect pitch. Kindness, confidence, and a genuine smile are more attractive than any one-liner.

Bottom line? It‚Äôs okay to be nervous. Most people are. But respect, clarity, and a little bit of courage can go a long way.

1mgjt5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1mgjt5w/explore_the_best_wireless_earbuds_jvc_haa30t2b/,Explore the Best Wireless Earbuds JVC HAA30T2B and Are They Worth It,"Testing out the JVC HAA30T2B earbuds has been a daily affair for me, and over time, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate both their strengths and where they could use a bit of polish. Equipped with a sleek, compact design and loaded with features like active noise cancellation, an impressive playback time, and water resistance, they cater to a variety of lifestyles‚Äîbut there are a few quirks worth noting that might influence your decision.

**Design and Comfort**  
Unpacking the JVC HAA30T2B wireless earbuds was a satisfying experience‚Äîthe minimalist design immediately stood out. The earbuds, paired with a slim, lightweight charging case, feel premium yet practical. They are compact enough to slide into your pocket without creating bulk. While testing them during my morning workout sessions and long commutes, I found the ergonomic silicone tips provided a snug fit without causing discomfort. The lightweight build is a major plus, as I hardly felt them in my ears even after hours of use. However, during more vigorous activities like running, the fit feels secure but not foolproof‚Äîan occasional adjustment is necessary to keep them in place.

**Sound Quality and Active Noise Cancellation**  
The audio performance of these earbuds is where they truly shine. Thanks to their dynamic audio drivers and active noise-canceling capabilities, the sound feels rich and immersive. Bass comes through strong without overwhelming other tones, and the clarity in vocals and instruments impressed even my husband, who‚Äôs an audiophile. I tested them out in different environments‚Äîbustling coffee shops, a crowded train, and at home near an open window. The active noise cancellation does a decent job of muting most everyday background noise, though it sometimes struggles with louder, more abrupt sounds.  

**Grab [JVC HAA30T2B] at the best price on Amazon.**  

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery life is one of the highlights here. Promising 27 hours of playback, including the charge provided by the case, these earbuds deliver. During several long-hour stints (yes, even over a weekend of gaming), I didn‚Äôt need to reach for the charging cable very often. A 2-hour charging time gets you topped up completely, and for those rushed mornings, the quick charge function is a lifesaver. Just a few minutes in the case provided enough juice to last me through a workout‚Äîa nice surprise for someone like me who forgets to pre-charge devices.

**Durability and Water Resistance**  
Having an IPX4 water resistance rating means these earbuds can handle light rain or sweat, making them a go-to option for both gym workouts and bustling daily activities. One particular instance where this proved handy was during an unexpected downpour. While my clothes were drenched, the earbuds performed without a hitch. However, I wouldn‚Äôt take them swimming or expose them to a prolonged torrent of water‚ÄîIPX4 is water-resistant, not waterproof.

**Positives**  
- Lightweight, comfortable, and portable design for extended wear  
- Reliable active noise cancellation for immersive audio  
- Exceptional battery life with quick charge functionality  
- Water-resistant, suitable for workouts and light rain  

**Audio Performance for Gamers and Viewers**  
Low latency mode was a feature I was especially eager to test, as I‚Äôm often gaming or streaming. In this mode, audio syncing improves noticeably‚Äîthere were no frustrating delays between the action I saw on screen and the sound, even during chaotic scenes in fast-paced games. However, while low latency is ideal for entertainment, switching back to regular mode took slightly longer than I expected.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Noise cancellation needs refinement for louder environments  
- Fit may require minor adjustments during intense activities  
- Limited customization options in the app for equalizer settings  

**Product Comparisons**  
Having also tested other earbuds in a similar price range, like the Samsung Galaxy Buds or Anker Soundcore Liberty Air, I can say these JVC earbuds hold their own in terms of sound quality and battery life. However, the Galaxy Buds offer more customization options for audiophiles via their app, while the Anker earbuds boast a slightly better grip during workouts. Where the JVC earbuds excel is in keeping a balance between features and comfort, making them more versatile overall for casual users.

**Value for Money**  
These earbuds present strong cost-efficiency for users looking for good audio quality, long battery life, and reliable construction. While not the flashiest pair on the market, they represent an affordable quality option that ticks many of the right boxes. The features are more than justified at their price, especially for those who prioritize functionality over frills. After using them as my daily drivers for weeks now, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre worth every penny for someone who needs dependable true wireless earbuds.

Trump, deep in his delusions about his ability to bully foreign governments, is figuratively banging his head against a wall.

He is finding out the hard way like a schoolyard bully, that when you try and smack someone, they smack back. And the world is smacking back. He announces trade deals like the one he says he has with Japan. It is not a trade deal, it is a capitulation the will negatively impact American families to the tune of 1,500 dollars a year.

It also turns out the 'trade deals' he has announced as accomplished are not 'deals', at all. They are frameworks for deals. Frameworks then will be changed, negotiated, altered, and compromised over the next year, or so. He tells us they are finalized, but, as usual, he is lying through his store bought teeth.

He will say anything, do anything, blame anyone to hide his incompetence, and real, educated economists and businessmen tell us to fear for the worst.

Only the beginning': Business leaders warn of Trump-induced economic crash

Story by Alexander Willis

¬© provided by RawStory

As fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is ‚Äúonly the beginning,‚Äù and that the impacts of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are already well underway, Politico reported Friday.

‚ÄúInflation and price increases are coming,‚Äù said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, speaking with Politico. ‚ÄúLayoffs have already been occurring, and supply is going to be lower as we head into the holiday season. These are all happening.‚Äù

Trump unveiled the latest tariff rates on Thursday, set to go into effect on Aug. 7, with tariff rates as high as 50% on major trading partners. Among countries hit with the top rate of 50% is Brazil, with imported Brazilian coffee representing 33% of all coffee consumption in the United States.

‚ÄúI think most people believe wholeheartedly that the impact of these tariffs is going to be felt in the months ahead,‚Äù Ahearn said. ‚ÄúAnd the reason why is that production and manufacturing and the goods as they flow through the supply chain takes time.‚Äù Another cause for concern among business leaders was the unpredictable nature of the tariffs, with among the United States‚Äô largest trading partners ‚Äì Canada, China and Mexico ‚Äì still negotiating with Trump as of Saturday, just days before tariffs are set to take effect.

Doubt also exists among business leaders regarding countries that Trump has already reached a trade agreement with many of which are only verbal or exist solely on a single letter, with no clear commitments from both parties.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a business and you‚Äôve got global supply chains and you‚Äôve got to make investments, it really matters that some countries are still in negotiations and certain countries are not in negotiations,‚Äù said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz, speaking with Politico.

‚ÄúWhere are Mexico and Canada gonna end up? We seem to know Vietnam, but do we really know Vietnam? It‚Äôs not clear yet.‚Äù

My office is in the Financial District and I don't mind a 30 minute walk (honestly prefer it to being stuck underground on Muni), so I've got some flexibility with location. What I'm really craving is somewhere that actually feels alive, you know? Like where I can grab decent coffee in the morning, pop into a grocery store for snacks, find a good dinner spot without having to Uber across town, maybe do some window shopping if I'm feeling fancy.

I keep hearing good things about Hayes Valley and I'm pretty tempted to book something there next time. Anyone stayed in that area for work? How's the walk to downtown? And are there other neighborhoods I should be considering?

The black device is lightweight, clocking in at just 6.4 ounces, which is a blessing during long shifts where you‚Äôre constantly scanning items. Its sleek yet robust structure feels good in hand, and the shape naturally fits into your grip. Even after using it extensively for several hours, my hand didn't start to cramp‚Äîa rarity with these types of tools. Honeywell clearly put some thought into comfort with this model, and for anyone using a scanner in high-volume scenarios, this gets a solid thumbs-up.  

The **USB connectivity** worked seamlessly. Connecting it to my work terminal required no complicated setup. It was literally plug-and-play, which scored points for convenience.  

**Fast and Versatile Performance**  
Here‚Äôs where this device really shines: its ability to handle both high-density barcodes as small as 3 mil and standard 13 mil barcodes. During testing, I was astonished by how quickly it reacted to each scan. Whether scanning codes close to 18 inches or right up against the surface, the accuracy was nearly flawless. I even threw some badly printed, smudged barcodes at it, expecting it to falter, but the performance remained on point. There‚Äôs no need for a specialty scanner if you're dealing with a mix of barcode types, which instantly makes the device versatile for a range of industries, including retail, healthcare, and logistics.

**Strengths**  
- Incredible scan accuracy, with no noticeable lag.  
- Lightweight but solid construction suitable for intensive use.  
- Handles both standard and high-density barcodes equally well.

**Durability for the Demanding Environments**  
Durability is a feature I never compromise on, and the Honeywell 1300g does not disappoint in this regard. My work area is chaotic at best, with devices often taking accidental tumbles. This scanner survived a couple of drops from waist height without a hitch. I even spilled coffee suspiciously close to it one morning, and its sturdy enclosure ensured no damage was done. For a scanner that can handle both light industrial environments and office use, this kind of ruggedness is non-negotiable.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The lack of a wireless option can be limiting, especially in environments where mobility is key.  
- A slightly higher noise level during scanning, which doesn‚Äôt bug me much but might irritate others in quieter workplaces.  
- Its build, while sturdy, is all plastic, which makes it feel less premium compared to some competitors.  

**Peer Products**  
When weighing the Honeywell 1300g against other barcode scanners, it holds up well against key competitors like the Zebra DS2208 and the Datalogic QuickScan I QD2430. The Zebra model, for instance, offers a wireless option‚Äîa feature the Honeywell lacks‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt handle high-density barcodes as well. Meanwhile, Datalogic‚Äôs alternative is priced similarly yet feels bulkier in use, which takes points off for comfort. Ultimately, Honeywell finds a sweet spot between performance and practicality, dominating workflows that prioritize efficiency over bells and whistles.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering its range of features and the reliability it delivers, the Honeywell 1300g Barcode Scanner strikes an excellent balance of cost and quality. While you might find cheaper barcode scanners, they often lack in scan accuracy or durability, especially in demanding work environments. On the other end of the spectrum, more expensive models don‚Äôt necessarily outperform it significantly unless you‚Äôre specifically looking for wireless functionality. For its price point, you‚Äôre getting a scanner that will last years with almost no maintenance.

1mgjnps,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mgjnps/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart,"Brewing coffee has always been an essential part of my morning. I recently got to try the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart coffee maker, and let me tell you, this machine has made my daily coffee ritual something I genuinely look forward to. From its sleek design to the innovative features it offers, this coffee maker stands out in more ways than one. Being a coffee enthusiast, it felt only natural to dive deep into what this brewer has to offer, testing it with various K-Cup pods, playing with different settings, and even letting my family members join the fun. Here‚Äôs my honest take after weeks of use.

**Thoughtful Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker definitely earns points for its aesthetic. The black stainless steel finish gives it a premium, modern vibe, blending seamlessly into my kitchen. Its compact dimensions, 8.3"" D x 13.4"" W x 12.4"" H, made it easy to find a spot on my counter without it feeling crowded. While it‚Äôs slightly heavier than some models I‚Äôve used, weighing in at 8.3 pounds, it feels sturdy and well-built. The dial-based interface is user-friendly, and even my tech-averse parents figured it out without much guidance. 

The removable 78 oz water reservoir is a godsend, especially for someone who drinks multiple cups throughout the day. No constant refills. Plus, it‚Äôs easy to clean‚Äîthankfully, no weird angles or hard-to-reach spots.

**Upsides**

- MultiStream Technology evenly saturates the coffee grounds for a richer flavor.
- BrewID customizes settings based on the K-Cup pod, ensuring a tailored brewing experience.
- Sleek, modern black stainless steel finish adds a touch of sophistication to any kitchen.
- Includes five strength and six temperature settings for customization.
- Large 78 oz water reservoir minimizes refill frequency.

**Smart Features for a Custom Brew**

The real magic lies in its BrewID technology. This feature genuinely surprised me. The coffee maker recognizes the specific brand and roast of the K-Cup pod, then customizes the brew settings accordingly. I experimented with different brands, from rich dark roasts to lighter breakfast blends, and I could taste the difference. It consistently delivered a full-flavored cup that felt tailored to the pod in use. Not to mention, using the Keurig app to adjust and store favorite settings has been so helpful. Mornings where I wake up groggy? I just use my phone to brew a cup without even leaving bed. It's slightly ridiculous‚Äîand also amazing.

My sister, who‚Äôs big into iced coffee, had a chance to test the over-ice functionality. It brewed a strong coffee that didn‚Äôt turn into a diluted mess the moment it hit the ice. I‚Äôm not a frequent iced-coffee drinker myself, but having the option to brew hot or cold beverages with precision is a win.

[Ready to buy Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Coffee Maker? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://designmara.com/p/b0973yh74z/)

**Performance and Consistency**

Every cup I brewed felt consistent, thanks to the MultiStream Technology. This feature saturates the coffee grounds more evenly, pulling out the rich flavors and enhancing the aroma. I tested it side by side with an older Keurig Classic brewer, and the difference was instantly noticeable. The K-Supreme Plus Smart delivered a smoother, more robust coffee profile while the Classic felt a little thin to me.

However, some adjustments might take time to fine-tune. While the app and machine settings are intuitive, they can be overwhelming at first. A few tries with temperature and strength combinations were needed before I started nailing down my preferred brews.

**Limitations**

- Could feel slightly overwhelming to first-time users due to extensive customizations.
- Requires a stable Wi-Fi connection for the full range of smart features.
- On the pricier side compared to basic coffee makers.
- A bit noisier during the brewing process than I'd hoped.

**Product Contenders**

Comparing this model to similar coffee makers like the Nespresso Vertuo Plus, there are noticeable differences. The Nespresso line often excels in producing espresso-like shots with their unique pods, but the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart shines when it comes to versatility. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of dark brews, mild options, or even iced beverages, Keurig‚Äôs brewing freedom is unmatched. That said, Nespresso users might find Keurig‚Äôs coffee lacking that specific creamy, espresso taste Nespresso machines are celebrated for.

Meanwhile, if we look at a simpler and cheaper competitor like the Keurig K-Classic, the Plus Smart blows it out of the water in terms of features and customization. That being said, if you're looking for something budget-friendly with no frills, the K-Classic remains a reliable choice.

**Financial Value**

Given its advanced features and solid performance, this coffee maker screams true value. Sure, it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, but if quality, convenience, and customization are what you‚Äôre after, then it‚Äôs worth every penny. I‚Äôve easily managed to save a lot on coffee shop visits just by making caf√©-quality brews at home. If you‚Äôre going to use it daily, as I do, the investment pays off.

[Carney wants to spend an extra $9B on defence by April.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-defence-spending-1.7598150) Is that possible? Prime Minister Mark Carney's goal of hitting NATO's defence spending target of two per cent of gross domestic product this year will be an uphill ‚Äî nearly impossible ‚Äî battle, say experts and critics. An extra $8.7 billion is earmarked for defence spending by the Department of National Defence (DND) or other government departments, and $370 million for the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). Allies had been pushing Canada to meet NATO's goal for nearly 20 years ‚Äî but actually actually doing so became imperative with Donald Trump in the White House. ""By the time we get back into Parliament and a budget is passed, we're going to have half a year to spend money that the department won't be able to shovel out the door,"" Bezan said in an interview with CBC News. But some within the Canadian defence industry as well as DND and Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) themselves point to existing mechanisms that can be leveraged to move quickly. Those include the use of standing offers, supply arrangements and pre-qualified vendor lists, as well as strategic partnerships with defence companies identified as centres of excellence, bilateral partnerships with other countries and the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. In situations that are truly time sensitive, the government can invoke a National Security Exception (NSE), Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) or issue an Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN). Although these have strict eligibility criteria and are not everyday tools.

Bill 212, titled the ‚ÄúReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act‚Äù was introduced in the legislature in October and passed the following month. Among other things, it called for the removal of bike lanes along Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue in Toronto. Ultimately, the judge agreed with the evidence that removal of the bike lanes would put people at increased risk of harm and death, violating the right to life and security of the person under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms enshrined in the constitution. But perhaps more importantly, the judge found that the government had not presented any evidence to support its claims. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a spectacular failure on the part of the Ontario government to defend its decision to remove bike lanes,‚Äù David Schneiderman told CP24.com.

The disappointing figures ‚Äì coupled with a downward revision of the two previous months amounting to 258,000 fewer jobs and data showing that economic output and consumer spending slowed in the first half of the year ‚Äì point to an overall economic deterioration in the US. Trump defended his decision to fire US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

[Ukraine uncovers major military corruption scheme.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/) Ukraine‚Äôs anti-corruption bodies said on Saturday they had uncovered a major graft scheme that procured military drones and signal jamming systems at inflated prices, two days after the agencies‚Äô independence was restored following major protests. The independence of Ukraine‚Äôs anti-graft investigators and prosecutors, NABU and SAPO, was reinstated by parliament on Thursday after a move to take it away resulted in the country‚Äôs biggest demonstrations since Russia‚Äôs invasion in 2022. Zelenskiy, who has far-reaching wartime presidential powers and still enjoys broad approval among Ukrainians, was forced into a rare political about-face when his attempt to bring NABU and SAPO under the control of his prosecutor-general sparked the first nationwide protests of the war. Zelenskiy subsequently said that he had heard the people‚Äôs anger, and submitted a bill restoring the agencies‚Äô former independence, which was voted through by parliament on Thursday. In  a statement published by both agencies on social media, NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of national guard personnel taking bribes. None of them were identified in the statement. ‚ÄúThe essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,‚Äù it said, adding that the offenders had received kickbacks of up to 30 per cent of a contract‚Äôs cost.

## Key features Analysis

The best man cave man candles stand out due to a combination of high-quality ingredients, distinctive scent profiles, and extended burn times. These candles aren't just about masking odors ‚Äì they're about creating an immersive sensory experience that resonates with the masculine spirit.

**Wax Composition:** Premium man candles often utilize natural waxes like soy, beeswax, or coconut wax. These waxes burn cleaner and slower than paraffin wax, which is a petroleum byproduct. Soy wax, for example, is biodegradable, renewable, and produces less soot, ensuring a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing burn.

**Scent Formulation:** The sophistication of a man candle lies in its layered scent formulation. Top notes provide the initial impression, middle notes form the core of the fragrance, and base notes contribute to the long-lasting depth. Superior candles use a blend of essential oils and fragrance oils to achieve a complex and nuanced aroma. expect to find notes of cedarwood, sandalwood, leather, tobacco, bourbon, and other traditionally masculine scents.

**Burn Time:** A candle's burn time dictates its overall value. High-quality man candles typically offer burn times ranging from 50 to 80 hours, thanks to the use of slow-burning waxes and optimal wick placement. Longer burn times meen less frequent replacement and a more consistent fragrance experience over time.

1mgjl77,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mgjl77/should_you_buy_the_best_wireless_earbuds/,Should you buy the best wireless earbuds Skullcandy Sesh ANC,"Testing the Skullcandy S2TEW-Q740 earbuds for a few weeks brought some surprises. Skullcandy is known for delivering solid, budget-friendly options, so I was curious about how this model with active noise cancellation and other premium features would hold up. These wireless earbuds look sleek in ""True Black,"" and their lightweight, in-ear design makes them suitable for daily commutes, workouts, and even lounging around. Featuring a premium 4-mic digital active noise-canceling system, they promise to rival pricier competitors like Sony and Bose in this space. But do they deliver? Let‚Äôs unpack my experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the earbuds caught my eye with their discreet and stylish True Black color. Their construction felt sturdy enough, even though they‚Äôre made of plastic. I‚Äôm usually skeptical about durability when it comes to lightweight earbuds, but these surprised me‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt feel cheaply made. Each earbud sits snugly in the charging case, which is also compact and conveniently portable. In terms of comfort, Skullcandy included multiple ear tip sizes, making it easier to find the right fit. During longer runs, they stayed secure, which is often a concern with earbuds, especially when sweat enters the equation. The IP67 waterproof rating adds another layer of reassurance, practically begging me to take these out in unpredictable weather or to sweaty gym sessions without the fear of damage.

**Sound Performance and Noise Cancellation**  
One of the standout features of this product is its 4-mic active noise-cancelling technology, and I put it through the wringer while working in noisy coffee shops and bustling city streets. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it drowned out chatter, engines, and even mild construction noise. You‚Äôre not getting absolute silence like top-tier ANC products, but for mid-range earbuds, the noise cancellation punches above its weight. As for sound quality, they offer robust bass, crisp mids, and clear highs. My EDM playlist sounded lively, and switching to podcasts delivered crystal-clear vocals, even at lower volume.  

**Check Skullcandy S2TEW-Q740 price on Amazon.**

**Positives**  
I‚Äôd say these earbuds deliver great value for what they promise, and here‚Äôs why:  
- The 32-hour combined battery life is a lifesaver for heavy users like me. The earbuds themselves last up to 6 hours with ANC on, while the case adds an extra 26 hours.  
- Tile tracking was an unexpected delight! It‚Äôs ridiculously easy to find misplaced earbuds using the Tile app.   
- Rapid charging had me sold. A quick 10-minute charge gave me two hours of use, perfect for those mornings when I forgot to charge them overnight.  
- Waterproofing and dust resistance remove any worry about long jogs in drizzles or dusty hikes.  

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery performance on these earbuds was a huge benefit for someone like me who often forgets to recharge. Advertised for 32 hours of total playtime, they didn‚Äôt disappoint. Testing with ANC turned on, I got about six hours, close to what the company claimed. The charging case provided multiple recharges, and the rapid-charging feature saved me on a busy Friday when I had back-to-back calls. In just 10 minutes, charging gave nearly 2 hours of playback. Although the case itself is a bit plug-heavy, I wish they had thrown in wireless charging to complete the convenience.

**Negatives**  
While these earbuds shine in many departments, they aren‚Äôt without flaws, such as:  
- Connectivity was inconsistent at times. Despite boasting Bluetooth 5.3, audio occasionally lagged when switching between devices (like my laptop and phone).  
- While ANC works great for mid-level disruptions, harsher noises like train horns or babies crying weren‚Äôt masked as effectively.  
- The touch controls are finicky. Several times, I ended up pausing or skipping tracks when all I wanted was to adjust the fit.  

**Product Comparisons**  
In the world of active noise-canceling wireless earbuds, many top brands compete, including Sony WF-1000XM5 and Jabra Elite 85t. While Sony‚Äôs earbuds deliver exceptional sound clarity and class-leading ANC, they sit at a higher price point, making the Skullcandy option appealing for budget-conscious buyers. Jabra‚Äôs Elite 85t excels in fit and comfort for extended wear, particularly for office calls, but it doesn‚Äôt have Tile tracking‚Äîa feature that feels like a secret weapon in Skullcandy‚Äôs arsenal. That said, the Skullcandy earbuds lag slightly in ANC effectiveness and overall connectivity compared to these premium models.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Priced as a mid-level option, these earbuds provide solid value for the features they offer. From waterproofing to noise cancellation and the addition of Tile tracking, I genuinely found myself using every feature. They also cater to fitness enthusiasts and commuters alike, making them versatile. Though they don't quite compete head-to-head with the Sony or Bose ANC offerings, they‚Äôre not meant to‚Äîand they‚Äôre much easier on the wallet. If you're after a mix of useful features and affordability, they‚Äôre worth considering.

Is this the future? Are companies *really* lining up to PAY people to test mobile apps from their COUCH? ü§Ø

Okay, maybe I‚Äôve been sleeping on this but I just stumbled onto a list that sent me DOWN a rabbit hole. Apparently, 2025 is shaping up to be THE year for (drumroll)‚Ä¶ remote, flexible mobile app testing jobs.

Did I miss the memo? When did pressing buttons and finding glitches go from ‚Äúgive you $20 on Fiverr‚Äù to MASSIVE COMPANIES with benefits?

Let me walk you through what I just learned. Prepare to be as shocked as I am.

Here are 10 companies legit hiring for mobile app testers AND the gigs are mostly remote/flexible (yes, even if you live in plaid pajama pants):

- Google ‚Äî YES, they want home-based QA testers for new app launches (and the pay isn‚Äôt basic).
- Applause ‚Äî This crowd-testing giant is scaling up for 2025, with mind-blowing international opportunities.
- UserTesting ‚Äî Flexible test slots, quick pay, and big clients? Where was this when I was broke in college??
- Testbirds ‚Äî EU-based and onboarding NEWBIES, no insane prerequisites, just a love for nitpicking.
- Rainforest QA ‚Äî 100% remote, easy onboarding, and word is it‚Äôs getting competitive in there.
- Uber ‚Äî Imagine saying ‚ÄúI literally broke Uber's app and got *paid*‚Äù at your next dinner party?
- GoodNovel ‚Äî They're expanding their app everywhere and need TONS of testers. BTW, check this out: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (seriously, APPLY).
- Lionbridge ‚Äî Now ‚ÄúTelus International,‚Äù and still hiring remote QA for app work.
- GameChanger ‚Äî YES, you can get paid to test cutting-edge apps for sports and gaming!
- TestIO ‚Äî Fast turnarounds, not super heavy on experience-for-entry stuff = beginner friendly.

WHAT.

Like, I dunno whether to feel scammed by the universe or grateful I found this before the stampede.

PRO TIP: I kept seeing GoodNovel pop up like everywhere? Do not sleep on this one, they even have a direct link: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (YES, I APPLIED, I have no shame).

Is this a sign we‚Äôre ACTUALLY moving to a work-from-coffee-shop-and-flip-flops era?

A couple things to keep in mind:
- Most companies want at least some device variety (tablet, Android, iPhone).
- Testing gigs range from bug bashing to just FEEDBACK sessions (‚Äúdid the logo annoy you?,‚Äù etc.).
- Payouts: it‚Äôs not always make-bank-money, but, YES, if you stack a few gigs it gets REAL.

BTW, did I mention how obsessed I am with the legit interface over at GoodNovel? APPLY at: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ‚Äî if I can do it (barely awake), you can too.

So, am I the only one SHOOK or is this really the golden moment for side hustles, app buggers, and stealth pajama testers who want schedules as flexible as spaghetti?

Drop your hot takes, COUCH QA VETS, or first-timer horror stories below. Also, and let's be real, if you want to start, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is a sweet jumping-off point.

Steam billows. Tides crash, as the water hits the bottom of the cup, turning a pale golden pink. You watch the clouds form on the surface of the darkening, peach-coloured water, and rise out of the cup, into your nose.
It smells like your grandmother. Your Nai Nai. Her incense. Always burning. The sliver of silver smoke trickling up past Buddha‚Äôs smiling face. Rose, sandalwood. And she always had the kettle on. A heavy, black iron one. On the stove. It would whistle like in the olden days. She was always making tea. Drinking tea. Offering tea. She lived her life by tea. Drank who knows how many gallons a day. Did she have a system? You imagine she must have. All that tea. All those years. She must have cracked the code. The perfect way to make the perfect cup.

I would love people‚Äôs favorite spots in the region to go outside and read or any cute coffee shops or places with that perfect reading vibe!

Everytime I go take a nap on some of the park benches around here, I wake up with some money in my cup. This made me really question reality for a while. 

And so, it made me realize that perhaps there is some sort of ""fairy"" that goes around filling cups in exchange for nothing. Well, maybe not nothing. Since I often leave it close to my head when I slumber, so perhaps my dreams filter through the coffee cup, which would attract such an exchange. 

Now, I am left offended. Are my dreams really worth 62 cents (and mostly 2 to 5 cent quarters at that)? 

This leads to the main reason for this conversation. In which I'd like to ask, very nicely, to know the financial department's fax phone number responsible so that I may file a complaint. And hopefully acquire a refund for my lost dreams.

1mgjdai,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mgjdai/discover_how_the_bene_casa_espresso_maker_stands/,Discover How the Bene Casa Espresso Maker Stands Out in Our Detailed Review,"**A Closer Look at the Bene Casa BC-95511 Espresso Maker**

Upon testing the Bene Casa BC-95511 Espresso Maker, I was both impressed and intrigued. I‚Äôve been using it daily for a couple of weeks now, and this compact espresso machine has managed to find a cozy spot on my crowded kitchen counter. While it boasts some undeniably fantastic features, there are a few points worth highlighting for anyone considering this as their go-to choice for espresso brewing. Here‚Äôs my take based on hands-on experience.

**Design and Compactness**

In terms of design, the espresso maker is simple yet elegant. Its black finish, combined with the transparent carafe, gives it a polished, modern look. I appreciated the transparent carafe‚Äînot only is it visually appealing, but it also allowed me to watch the entire brewing process unfold. It‚Äôs oddly satisfying to see the espresso drip into the pot, especially in the early mornings when I‚Äôm still waking up. Its compact dimensions (9""D x 8""W x 12""H) make it easy to fit into small spaces, and since my kitchen doesn‚Äôt have much counter space, this was a big plus. However, if aesthetics play a large role in your appliance choices, the plastic build might feel a little underwhelming compared to more premium metal-bodied machines.

**Ease of Operation**

Being a fully automatic espresso machine, this model was incredibly straightforward to use. Even my cousin, who rarely brews coffee, had no trouble figuring it out when I handed it over to her during a family brunch. The touchscreen interface is intuitive and responsive, guiding you through options effortlessly. You can choose between brewing one or three cups at a time, making it versatile for different needs. I‚Äôm one of those people who usually drinks coffee solo, but it‚Äôs fantastic for guests when I need to whip up more than a single cup.

[Ready to snag Bene Casa BC-95511? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b002zjswqs/)

**Performance ‚Äì Brewing Experience**

Where the Bene Casa truly shines is in its speedy performance. It consistently brews a cup of espresso in under five minutes, which is crucial during those rush-hour mornings. The coffee came out hot but never burnt, all thanks to the automatic shut-off feature. I found the flavor to be rich and well-balanced when using high-quality ground coffee. However, as someone who loves experimenting, I noticed it‚Äôs not the best at extracting subtle flavor notes found in gourmet coffee beans. Still, for everyday use, this machine gets the job done admirably.

The ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù feature deserves a special mention. It maintains the espresso at just the right temperature for up to 30 minutes without scorching it. There were days when I brewed a cup and forgot about it because of an email I had to respond to. It was great to come back to a perfectly warm, still-flavorful espresso. The detachable base for cordless serving not only adds to convenience but also makes pouring safe and spill-free.

**Advantages**

- Brews a single or triple shot within minutes.  
- Transparent carafe lets you enjoy the brewing process visually.  
- Compact design fits snugly in smaller spaces. 
- The ‚Äòkeep warm‚Äô function ensures no wasted coffee.  
- Automatic shut-off prevents burning.  

**Disadvantages**

- Plastic build can feel less durable.  
- Struggles to bring out the nuanced flavors in specialty coffee.  

**Target Audience**

This machine is undoubtedly made for casual coffee drinkers or those dipping their toes into the espresso world. It‚Äôs especially ideal for people living in apartments, dorms, or shared spaces where every inch of counter space matters. My mother, who doesn‚Äôt drink coffee every day but likes having an espresso machine for occasional use, also found it perfect. On the flip side, if you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast searching for caf√©-quality espresso, there are high-end models better suited for such needs.

**Competing Products**

When it comes to espresso makers in the same range, the immediate competitors are the Bialetti Moka pot and the De'Longhi EC155. While the Moka pot needs manual effort and a stovetop for brewing, it showcases better durability because of its aluminum construction. On the other hand, the De'Longhi EC155 is slightly pricier but offers a milk frother for lattes and cappuccinos. Comparing the Bene Casa BC-95511 to these alternatives, I‚Äôd lean toward it for sheer convenience (automatic operation and quick brewing) but would pick the De'Longhi if versatility mattered more.

**Financial Value**

Speaking of its cost efficiency, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs quite budget-friendly given its convenience-focused design and solid performance. It covers all the basics of espresso brewing without the added fancy features that would drive the price higher. While maintaining this affordability, the inclusion of thoughtful touches like the keep-warm function makes it feel like you‚Äôre getting more bang for your buck compared to bare-bones models.

1mgjcoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mgjcoc/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_breville_smart/,Explore the best electric kettle Breville Smart Kettle Luxe worth it,"Finding the perfect kitchen appliance that not only performs well but also adds elegance to your countertop can feel like a quest. After testing the Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 Smart Kettle Luxe daily, I‚Äôve gathered plenty to share about its design, functionality, and unique touches that make it one of the more impressive electric kettles I‚Äôve tried recently. Of course, there are a few quirks, but isn‚Äôt that true for all gadgets?

**Sophistication in Design**  
Visually, this brushed stainless steel kettle screams modern luxury. It‚Äôs sleek, understated, and fits well into any kitchen aesthetic, from minimalistic vibes to cozy farmhouse styles. The 7-cup capacity is ideal for everything from morning coffee for one to an impromptu tea party. The soft opening lid barely makes a sound, which is a small detail but one that I noticed and appreciated, especially during those early groggy mornings when noise feels louder than usual.

**Advantages**  
- Intelligently designed 5 temperature settings for tea and coffee lovers  
- Convenient ""Keep Warm"" function ensures your brew stays at the optimal temperature for up to 20 minutes  
- Cordless design with 360-degree base for easy portability  
- Safety features like the soft-open lid to prevent spills and splashes  

**Performance and Functionality**  
The real star feature is the temperature control. The pre-programmed options for black, green, white, and oolong teas, as well as French press coffee, ensure precision every time. As someone who deeply appreciates the nuances of green tea‚Äôs flavor, having the ability to nail just the right temperature made a tangible difference in the taste. The ""Keep Warm"" button is handy too‚ÄîI can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve gotten distracted mid-pour only to find my water still warm when I returned.

[Check Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07t23dyjb/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Daily use highlighted just how intuitive the controls are. Press a button, select your temperature, wait a minute, and voil√†‚Äîhot water with zero guesswork. The hinged lid was particularly helpful because it eliminated pesky lifting and gave me peace of mind that I wasn‚Äôt risking splashes.

**Drawbacks**  
- Slightly on the heavier side compared to competitors  
- The lid, while soft-closing, can feel too tight at times  
- No dedicated alert sound when water is ready‚Äîmore of a personal nitpick, but worth considering  

**Competing Products**  
Other electric kettles that I‚Äôve tested include models from Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach. While these alternatives might offer similar temperature settings, I felt the Breville kettle stood apart with its build quality and thoughtful extras like the soft-top lid. The Hamilton Beach models are generally lighter and cheaper, but they lack the sleek aesthetics and premium feel I want in a high-use item. Meanwhile, Cuisinart kettles often have temp control, but their buttons feel a bit clunky in comparison to the seamless experience of Breville.  

**Price Performance**  
Considering its durable build, advanced features, and safety enhancements, the price certainly feels justified, especially for enthusiasts of tea and French press coffee. If you‚Äôre someone who values precision and is tired of water scorched beyond its boiling point, this kettle becomes an investment in your daily routine. Cheaper options might offer the basics, but this one ensures a level of consistency that‚Äôs hard to beat with budget kettles.

1mgj7y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mgj7y9/should_you_buy_the_best_food_grinder_cuisinart/,Should You Buy the Best Food Grinder Cuisinart ECH-4GM,"Using the Cuisinart ECH-4GM Elemental Chopper Grinder over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve discovered just how practical and reliable it can be for everyday kitchen tasks. With its sleek gun-metal design, the product naturally fits into any modern countertop aesthetic without being an eyesore. But beyond its looks, this compact yet capable chopper-grinder brings a lot to the table‚Äîliterally. Whether you‚Äôre new to kitchen appliances or just want something manageable, this model offers something worthwhile. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that catches the eye is the understated yet elegant gun-metal finish. It‚Äôs both stylish and modern, making it an asset to any kitchen decor. At a mere 3.3 pounds, the lightweight build means you can easily carry it around without a fuss, but it‚Äôs still sturdy enough to feel secure during use. Its compact dimensions, 5.6"" x 7.2"" x 9.29"", fit neatly on my limited counter space. Plus, the 4-cup capacity bowl with a handle adds convenience, especially if you‚Äôre prepping smaller portions. Despite its modest size, the build feels durable and well-crafted for the price.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
The touchpad controls for chopping and grinding are surprisingly user-friendly. A couple of taps are all it takes to get this thing going. Whether it‚Äôs pureeing soft vegetables or grinding coffee beans, the patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade gets the job done. The sharp edge excels at delicate cuts, while the blunt edge powers through tougher ingredients like nuts and spices. But here‚Äôs a critical tip: If the blade or lid isn‚Äôt properly locked, the machine won‚Äôt turn on‚Äîa minor irritation, but at least a sign of Cuisinart‚Äôs focus on safety!  

[Check Cuisinart ECH-4GM Elemental Chopper Grinder price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b0749t5kgc/)

**Performance in Action**  
When tasked with chopping onions, the product sliced through evenly, saving me the tears. Smaller jobs like making a quick salsa or grinding dried spices were straightforward, and the results were excellent every time. Admittedly, it struggled a little with larger chunks of tough ingredients like carrots, requiring some pre-cutting. However, the exclusive BladeLock system ensures a solid grip when pouring, so the mess is kept to an absolute minimum‚Äîa feature that‚Äôs been a real sanity-saver during busy meal preps.  

**Maintenance and Durability**  
Cleaning this device is surprisingly stress-free. All removable parts are dishwasher-safe, another big win for those of us who dread the post-cooking cleanup. I opted to wash the bowl and blade by hand most of the time to extend their longevity, and it was a breeze. The quality of the metal blade stands out too; it‚Äôs remained sharp even after multiple tests with various ingredients.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact size fits well in smaller kitchens.  
- Handle-equipped work bowl enhances usability.  
- Double-edged SmartPower blade handles both chopping and grinding tasks efficiently.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make for an easy cleanup.  

**Critiques**  
- Struggles with larger, tougher food pieces without pre-cutting.  
- Safety locking mechanism can be frustrating if not aligned properly.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing it with other brands like Ninja and KitchenAid compact processors, the Cuisinart holds up impressively. While the Ninja blender-processor combo offers more versatility, it‚Äôs often larger and less compact, making storage cumbersome for people with limited space. Meanwhile, KitchenAid‚Äôs mini chopper has comparable quality but comes without the BladeLock system, which sets the Cuisinart apart for safer handling. The Ninja might edge ahead in grinding hard ingredients like nuts better, but for everyday chopping and grinding in smaller portions, the Cuisinart remains a solid performer.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For a product that handles a variety of food prep tasks while keeping safety and user-friendliness at the forefront, the value proposition is undeniable. It‚Äôs relatively affordable and delivers dependable performance, making it a smart pick for cooks who need a reliable, hassle-free chopper-grinder. You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find a similar product in this price bracket that offers such a balanced set of features.

I feel really comfortable when I talk to him. He gives me vibes of somebody that would be loyal. He recently drew a sketch of me, framed it and gave it to me as gift which I thought was really sweet. He's also bought me cookies and coffee before. I can tell he's into me but hasn't made a move.

Picture this: **AI has become the new Middle Manager.** You know, the one that micromanages your existence, monitors your coffee breaks, and somehow still forgets your name. Welcome to our machine civilization, where AI isn't just in your pocket‚Äîit's structuring your existential crises.

But let's rewind a bit. Before AI had a starring role in ""The Fast & The Autonomous,"" there were big promises. In the 1960s, the visionaries imagined a future where the web would be the ultimate democracy, freeing humanity from the chains of hierarchy and centralized power. Fast forward to today, and our digital utopia feels more like a rerun of ""Survivor: The Surveillance Edition.""

That brings us to Robert Skidelsky's ""Mindless: The Human Condition in the Age of Artificial Intelligence."" The book is not a tech doomsday manifesto but a historical deep-dive mixed with a splash of philosophical soul-searching, as Skidelsky wonders: Are we living inside our machines forgetting what it means to be human?

**Here's the kicker:** Skidelsky challenges the old prophecy‚Äîfirst from Marx, then Keynes‚Äîthat technology would enable lives of leisure. Instead, we find ourselves clinging to our jobs like they're the last lifeboats on a sinking ship. Productivity staggers while we drown in digital distractions‚Äîwelcome to the age of machines that don't just help us; they define us, sometimes at our own expense.

Skidelsky doesn't play favorites with tech pessimism either. He takes us on a historical carousel ride, probing the very narratives we cling to. The digital revolution promised participation but delivered procrastination; algorithms promised empowerment but resulted in entrapment. And as for us? We're caught somewhere between ""Black Mirror"" episodes and old Huxleyan dreams disguised as TikTok trends.

Yet, fear not! Instead of scripting an AI apocalypse, Skidelsky invites us to shift our perspectives‚Äînot toward dismantling AI but reimagining our cohabitation with it. 

üëâ **So here's the twist:** Are we the unwitting architects of our machine-made reality, or can we tweak this narrative before the machines plot the sequel? How do we regain our human agency while living comfortably as AI's frenemies? Drop your thoughts, hopes, or even a cheeky Sci-Fi plotline below!",1,1754227439.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

Mom of 3 and this is the first I've been able to bf for any period of time. We made it 6 months (minus 1 day ü§£)! I've struggled with supply since around the 3 month mark. Combo feeding, power pumping, supplements,  eating enough oats to raise a beef cow, sore nips, the waterboarding level of hydration. I'm sooooo glad to be done. 

36 hours since my last pump, and for the first time in months I feel HAPPY! We went to the lake yesterday, I got to enjoy all 3 of my kids THE WHOLE DAY! No sneaking off to get a pump sesh in. I got to sleep in today! Trading my morning pump for a cup of coffee alone before the kiddos start stirring. 

Yes, I'm a little sad i didnt make the finish line. But I can say with certainty, the sacrifice of my mental health is not worth fighting the battle. If you are reading this and struggling like I did, just know that it is more than okay to give up bf/ep. We get a very short amount of time with our precious babies. I would much rather spend that time soaking in all the cuddles, sweet chuckles/smiles, little fingers/toes than constantly stressing about supply. Fed is best. Your babies aren't going to remember the sacrifice, the hard work, the late nights/ early mornings.

This little brewer has been making its mark on my morning routine, and while there are things to love, a few quirks are worth sharing.

**Design and Compactness**  
The standout feature of this coffee maker has to be its slim and modern profile‚Äîit‚Äôs just under 5 inches wide! It easily fits into the tightest of corners, making it ideal for small spaces like dorm rooms, office desks, or studio apartments. The matte dusty rose finish adds a unique, aesthetic touch, blending in seamlessly with other modern appliances on my counter. As someone who values functionality paired with design, I‚Äôve found this a delightful visual addition to my kitchen setup. Beyond its good looks, it comes with cord storage tucked away in the back, which has saved me from the hassle of tangled countertops.  

[Check Keurig K-Mini K-Mini price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b08323nvl1/)  

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Using this machine feels almost too simplistic. I just fill its single-cup water reservoir for each brew, pop in my favorite Keurig K-Cup pod, and press that brew button‚Äîit‚Äôs really straightforward. The machine is fully automatic, which means even half-dead mornings are no barrier to fresh coffee. The brewing process itself is surprisingly quick, which I appreciate during rushed weekday mornings.

**Versatility and Brew Customization**  
With the ability to brew cup sizes ranging from 6 to 12 ounces, there‚Äôs flexibility for different preferences. Whether I‚Äôm opting for a larger mug of wake-up juice or just a small cup to accompany breakfast, this brewer has me covered. For travel enthusiasts, the removable drip tray is gold‚Äîmy 7-inch travel mug easily fits under the spout and is saved from spills. Additionally, the fact that it works seamlessly with reusable coffee filters like the My K-Cup has encouraged me to experiment with my personal coffee grounds instead of sticking solely to pods. 

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**  
A surprising feature for such a budget-friendly device is its energy-efficient design. The auto-off function kicks in 90 seconds after the last brew, giving me peace of mind when rushing out the door. Cleaning has also proven effortless. Unclipping the drip tray after an ‚Äúoops‚Äù moment resulted in no stress‚Äîspills are quick to wipe away. The machine itself is light at 4.6 pounds, so moving it for cleaning or rearranging doesn‚Äôt feel like a workout.  

**Positives**  
The perks of this machine won‚Äôt go unnoticed:
- Its super lightweight frame and cord storage make it portable and travel-friendly.
- Brews within minutes, ensuring your coffee is fast and fresh.
- Energy-efficient auto-off feature helps save electricity.
- Compatible with both pods and ground coffee with its My K-Cup compatibility.  

**Drawbacks**  
No product is without flaws, and this one has its quirks:
- The one-cup water reservoir means you must refill it for every use, which some may find tedious.  
- Despite being labeled as portable, it lacks a built-in handle, which would have been helpful for moving around.  
- There‚Äôs no way to adjust water temperature, so you‚Äôre stuck with whatever setting the brewer defaults to.  
- As much as I love the dusty rose color, not everyone might find the current matte palette appealing.   

**Competing Products**  
For those considering alternatives, there are a few big contenders. The Nespresso Essenza Mini, for instance, offers a similarly compact design, but its price point tends to be higher, and it‚Äôs more limited to espresso-style shots rather than customizable cup sizes. Another option, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, offers compatibility with both ground coffee and pods, much like the Keurig K-Mini; however, its larger size makes it less suitable for compact spaces. Where the K-Mini excels is its minimalist form factor and aesthetics, making it a better fit for users who prioritize style without forgoing performance.  

**Smart Spending**  
The functionality offered at its price point definitely lands this coffee maker in the ‚Äúgood value‚Äù category for me. While it‚Äôs not loaded with high-tech features, it covers the basics exceptionally well, delivering reliable performance and tailored convenience. You‚Äôre paying for simplicity, portability, and Keurig‚Äôs dependable quality‚Äîa fair trade if you‚Äôre not looking to break the bank for a coffee maker.

To everyone. Anyone. You feel warm. Laser-focused. You have to stretch on your tippy-toes to reach the basket. The kettle clicks. Bubbling. You have tea with Nai Nai. 

You watch the event horizon swell by 0.0001 degrees.

You stop to actually look at it. All this time, it was just there. But you kept on keeping on. Logging. Recording. Waiting. So, you actually take a good look. It‚Äôs quite beautiful. Just like the deep space composites. A fiery sunset perfectly reflected on a black sea. You know what‚Äôll happen. Theoretically, anyway‚Äîto a point. You won‚Äôt feel anything. There won‚Äôt be a you to feel it. Energy can‚Äôt be destroyed. So, something of you will still be there, if it‚Äôs even right to call it you at that point. Maybe she was right. Or Buddha, for that matter. The void. Maybe there was never a you there in the first place. Just energy arranged in this way or that. You were always trying to work it out. Understand it. Soon, it‚Äôll be a different kind of arrangement. Or no arrangement at all. Which is a certain kind of arrangement, no?
It sure feels like you were there. It felt real, didn‚Äôt it? 

Day 313 since you lost comms.

You check O‚ÇÇ levels. 21 percent.
You run diagnostics. Same as they ever were.
You ping Earth. 
You log vitals. Reboot the water recycler.
Run 10k. Brush your teeth.
Check cabin pressure. Check the reactor.
Refill the humidifier.
Say your name out loud. Notice white hairs.

Watch the event horizon swell by 0.0001 degrees.

The reactor hums grow louder. The fiery sunset gets bigger. Brighter. Whiter. The hum rises to a deafening stampede of fanfare. Rose, Chrysanthemum linger in your nostrils. You feel the sun on your skin.

The brightest light you ever saw.

Sound fades. Smell dissipates. Your mouth goes dry. Your body cools and feels weightless. Your‚Ä¶ body? Your heart softens in your chest. 

You are. You are. You are. 

Are. Are. Are.

1mgiycf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1mgiycf/how_did_taking_care_of_7_younger_siblings_ruined/,How did taking care of 7 younger siblings ruined me,"Tw : abuse, suicide thoughts, thoughts about hurting others, child abuse, neglect 

I'm a second child in a family with lots of kids, being the second oldest sibling was a nightmare, being tossed aside as my sister got all the attention is a nightmare, and it got worse every time a child was born, i literally learned how to change diapers, cook, clean the dishes, wipe the floor, cleaning the bed when they wet it, at 8 - 10. I remember mom waking me up after i accidentally slept in the living room to change my little sister's diapers, i got a smack so i was half asleep, crying, and Changing her diapers, just imagining the scene. A child taking care of another one. 

And just when i say no i get a smack, hit with a belt, pinched, bitten, for saying no. Her reasoning for this is that ""she brought me into this world to take care of her and to obey her."" she own me after all.! That means spending my childhood days cleaning and taking care of my stupid siblings instead of playing outside like a normal kid. 


As i grew up and got into middle school things just got worse, with my 8th sister being born, i fell into a severe depression, my mom was now tired and laying on bed after giving birth. Taking care of the house was on me. I refused to hold my newborn sister or be alone with her since i had a strong urge to just kill her, i would just leave the room every time I'm left with her, i just can't stop thinking about opening the window, throwing her out from the 3th floor, when i finally picked her up and looked at the window i was just shaking violently, she was so small in my arms, it made me want to cry. I gently returned her and left the room. (she's ok for everyone who was wondering i isolated myself from her unit she was 3, we had a good relationship by that time and i she was more attached to me than mom.)


Everything was overwhelming, coming home to my siblings fighting, screaming, tv on high volume, mom and dad fighting about him not buying enough for for us was just hell for me. Our lunch was basically rice and chicken. Our fridge was always empty. My dad refusing to give us money for school was also annoying because he can't just give all of his children money for school every day, god no we were too broke for that. 

My 13 years old self finally figured something to get out of this messy hell, i was staying up all night and eat and drink and do my usual routine at night, and when it was time to school i basically slept through the classes, some teachers saw the state of neglect i was in and let me sleep, some didn't. It was genuinely refreshing to have a bit of quiet if it meant I'd sacrifice my sleeping. 


I don't know how many times my parents were called to school for neglect, i can't even count how many times teachers locked me up in a room and tried to get information from me about why i look like that and why i always ""forget my lunch"". 


I'd like to say in the end i love my siblings and I'm always taking care of them, they turn to me when something happens, yes it's a hell to stop them from fighting, changing their clothes when they wet the bed in the middle of the night, but it was a nightmare, my siblings grew up, but at what cost? I sacrificed my mental health, i can't socialize properly, and i just break down crying when someone just yell at me, I'm addicted to being abused, and i genuinely hate myself. I just hope my siblings don't end up like me, I'm so proud of them for growing up to be wonderful smart teenagers. 


One night i was laying in bed with my dad in the same room trying to sleep. We were chatting until he mentioned not having enough children. He said to me that he wouldn't stop until he gets lots of sons, not daughters. I just froze in my bed and cried my eyes out after he slept. I'm not even surprised, he locks himself in his room and spends his time on his computer and just leave to make coffee or do small chatting or fight with my mother. I've never felt so worthless in my life, was i a failed attempt of getting a son?... I still remember that conversation like it was yesterday. ",2,1754226844.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs a story about late-night love, cookie crumbs, quiet moments, and the kind of care that speaks without saying a word. If you‚Äôve ever loved someone so deeply that you wanted to leave pieces of comfort behind for them‚Ä¶ this is for you.

**Part I: The Cookie Surprise**

The world outside was still dark, that soft kind of hush that only happens just before the sun rises. Inside the house, it was quiet¬† the kind of quiet that holds warmth, not emptiness. Jenny was fast asleep, her hair tousled against the pillow, the faint rise and fall of her chest syncing perfectly with the rhythm of peace.

You tiptoed into your child‚Äôs room, gently nudging the little bundle curled up under the blankets. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù you whispered with a smile, ‚Äúwant to help me surprise Mommy?‚Äù

Two sleepy eyes blinked open. A beat. Then a grin. ‚ÄúCookies?‚Äù

You nodded, and the grin got bigger.

Moments later, the kitchen lights flicked on low. The two of you worked like coconspirators in a delicious little secret. Mixing bowls came out. Eggs cracked (some less gracefully than others). A spoon clanged on the counter, and both of you froze, holding in giggles, waiting to see if Mommy stirred. Nothing.

The laughter couldn‚Äôt hold in forever, though.

A small handful of flour launched across the counter¬† a direct hit to your shirt. You gasped in dramatic horror, eyes wide as your child doubled over in laughter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in for it now,‚Äù you whispered, launching a gentle dusting back their way. More laughter. More flour. A mess was forming, but it was the beautiful kind¬† joy baked into every speck.

You worked together, side by side. Measuring, stirring, sneaking a few chocolate chips into your mouths. When the tray slid into the oven, the smell began to fill the house¬† sweet, warm, home.

With the plate piled high and warm in small hands, you both tiptoed back into the bedroom. Your little one climbed up beside Jenny, whispering loudly, ‚ÄúMommy‚Ä¶ Mommy, wake up‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jenny stirred, blinking sleepily.

And then the words that would melt even the most exhausted of hearts:

‚ÄúDad and I baked you cookies.‚Äù

There was a pause, a sleepy smile forming slowly, stretching into full blown love as she took in the flour streaked cheeks, the chocolate smudges, the proud little face and the plate of warm cookies.

Her eyes shifted to you. You shrugged with a grin. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep. Thought we‚Äôd make something sweet.‚Äù

She sat up, brushed a strand of hair behind her ear, and looked at both of you like she had just been handed the entire universe.

‚ÄúYou really did this?‚Äù she asked softly, her voice thick with love.

And in that moment¬† messy kitchen, flour footprints, a clock reading far too early¬† you knew.

This. This was what love looked like. A sleepy smile. A warm cookie. A shared mess. A quiet moment at the edge of sunrise where everything made sense.

**Part II: Love, in the Morning Light**: From Jenny‚Äôs Journal

There‚Äôs still flour on the cabinet handle.

I could‚Äôve cleaned it. I probably should‚Äôve. But every time I walk past it, it makes me smile¬† like the house itself is holding the memory a little longer, like it knows what this morning meant to me.

I woke up to the sound of our child‚Äôs laughter. Not just giggling¬† full body joy, bubbling over and impossible to contain. Then I heard his voice. That soft, low, forever safe voice that I know better than my own heartbeat. He was laughing too. Trying to whisper, failing miserably.

And then came those little footsteps. Fast. Eager.

‚ÄúMommy! Dad and I baked you cookies!‚Äù

I opened my eyes and saw them both¬† standing there like something out of a dream. A plate of cookies, warm and messy. A trail of flour down the hall. Chocolate on their cheek. A look on his face that said: I‚Äôd give you the world if I could.

He would. He has.

He gives me this world every day.

And I don‚Äôt mean the cookies or the way he can turn even the most chaotic mess into a masterpiece. I mean the way he shows up. Again and again. In little ways that no one else sees¬† except maybe B, that wise little bunny who‚Äôs seen it all. The way he makes our child feel like the most important person in the universe. The way he looks at me when I‚Äôm still half asleep and haven‚Äôt brushed my hair and he still looks at me like I‚Äôm made of magic.

He used to tell me that his love would be different. That it would be loud and quiet all at once. That it would pour out like a river and never stop.

I didn‚Äôt understand it back then.

But I do now.

It‚Äôs not just in the big gestures or the way he says I love you with his whole soul. It‚Äôs in the mornings like this¬† when the world is still soft and unformed, and he chooses me all over again. When he chooses us.

I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll ever understand just how deeply I feel all of it. But if he doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll spend the rest of our lives showing him.

Love, Jenny

**Part III: The Cleanup**: Later That Morning

The cookies were half eaten, the plate abandoned on the nightstand. The little one had long since curled up on the couch with a cartoon playing quietly, a blanket halfway falling off. That post cookie crash hit fast.

Jenny and I stood in the kitchen, barefoot, our hands dusted in flour, like two kids who had gotten away with something. The mess was everywhere¬† bowls stacked in the sink, chocolate smudges on the counter, a trail of tiny footprints in powdered sugar. A true love letter in the language of chaos.

She leaned against the counter and smiled at me, holding up a wooden spoon coated in what was once cookie dough.

‚ÄúYou two really went for it,‚Äù she said with that playful lift in her voice¬† amused, affectionate, all wrapped in one.

I smirked and took the spoon from her hand, kissing the top of her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky we didn‚Äôt try to make a cake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you still have cabinet doors.‚Äù

She handed me a dish towel. I passed her the sponge. No big speeches. No declarations. Just the quiet understanding of two people who knew what this meant¬† cleaning the mess we made together.

We worked in sync, moving through the wreckage of our little surprise. She wiped the counters while I loaded the dishwasher. Our hands would brush every now and then¬† a spark, a gentle press of warmth. Each time, she looked at me like it was the first time. Like somehow I‚Äôd surprised her all over again just by being here.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said suddenly, looking at me over her shoulder.

I looked up. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ all of this,‚Äù she said, waving the sponge vaguely at the room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I used to dream about. Not the mess exactly, but the life inside it.‚Äù

I paused, my heart catching in my throat.

She stepped closer, slipping her arms around me and resting her head on my chest. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt just bake me cookies this morning. You built a moment I‚Äôll never forget.‚Äù

I held her there, right in the middle of the flour dusted floor, and whispered against her hair, ‚ÄúEvery day I get with you¬† it‚Äôs all I ever wanted. And I‚Äôll keep building them, one messy kitchen at a time.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt rush. We didn‚Äôt need to. The world could wait a little longer while we stood there, surrounded by sugar and sunlight, wrapped in something that didn‚Äôt need to be spoken aloud anymore.

Because love, in that kitchen, was louder than words.

**Part IV: After the Flour Settles**

The sun had long since dipped behind the horizon, casting the living room in that soft, amber twilight. The only sound in the house was the gentle hum of the dishwasher and the occasional creak of the house settling into sleep. The cookie plate sat empty on the coffee table¬† just a few crumbs and smudged chocolate fingerprints left behind.

The little one had gone down early, worn out from sugar highs and flour fueled giggles. We tucked them in together¬† you kissed their forehead, Jenny whispered something soft into their ear. And now, the two of you sat on the couch in that hush that only comes after a full day of love.

Her legs were draped across yours, her head nestled into the crook of your shoulder, your arms wrapped around her like muscle memory. You were both tired, but the kind of tired that came from joy¬† the kind of tired that felt earned.

She ran her fingers absentmindedly across the fabric of your shirt and whispered, ‚ÄúYou were always going to be a good dad.‚Äù

You looked down at her, caught off guard by the sudden tenderness in her voice.

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù

She nodded, resting her chin on your chest so she could see you better. ‚ÄúNo, I know so. I knew it the second I saw the way you loved everything around you. You love‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs your purpose. Like the world might fall apart if you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Your hand found her cheek, thumb brushing across her skin. ‚ÄúYou and that kid‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre my whole world.‚Äù

She smiled gently, her eyes tracing every part of your face like she was memorizing it all over again. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt this safe,‚Äù she said.

1mgiukd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mgiukd/should_you_buy_the_best_countertop_ice_maker_smug/,Should You Buy the Best Countertop Ice Maker SMUG Ice Maker GN,"Ice makers were never something I thought I‚Äôd get excited about until I tried the SMUG Ice Maker GN. The description alone‚Äî‚Äú9 cubes in 6 minutes, with 2 sizes of bullet ice‚Äù‚Äîwas intriguing, but as someone who has hosted one too many parties with a bag of half-melted ice cubes, this portable machine quickly became a game-changer. It‚Äôs designed to blend into kitchens, RVs, or even camping scenarios, but it‚Äôs more than just its looks. Sure, I didn‚Äôt expect to find myself praising an ice maker to friends, but here we are. 

**Compact and Functional Design**

The first thing that caught my eye was how compact it is. At just 8.8 x 11.6 x 12.5 inches, it takes up surprisingly little counter space. I‚Äôve tried other countertop ice makers in the past that were bulky enough to double as small furniture pieces. At only 15.4 pounds, this one is portable enough to carry to an outdoor party or move around the kitchen without breaking a sweat. I even tossed it into the car for a camping trip; with its built-in handle, it‚Äôs as much at home in a cozy RV as in your kitchen. Honestly, the green color didn‚Äôt hurt either‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt love a pop of style for their appliances?

**Impressive Ice Speed**

It claims to produce 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes, and my tests backed that up. I was skeptical about this claim because ‚Äúinstant"" always turns out to mean ‚Äú20 minutes later.‚Äù This one delivered, though; in the middle of prepping for a barbecue, boom‚Äî9 ice cubes, ready to cool drinks faster than I could slice a lime. Even more impressive, it churned out 26.5 pounds of ice over the course of the day. I don‚Äôt even think my freezer could compete with that. 

**[Check SMUG Ice Maker GN price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b09bvwbmjp/)**

**Flexible Ice Size Options**

Having two size settings feels unnecessary until you actually need it. For cocktails, I preferred the smaller ice because it didn‚Äôt overwhelm the glass, whereas larger cubes were great for iced coffee. Switching between the two options was simple‚Äîall it took was pressing the ‚ÄúSELECT‚Äù button on the control panel. My coworker‚Äôs kid even managed to figure it out during a summer gathering, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs straightforward enough for anyone to use.

**Automatic Cleaning and Maintenance**

I have to admit‚Äîcleaning appliances has never been my strong suit, which is why I appreciated the automatic cleaning function. Holding the power button for five seconds kicked it into cleaning mode. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve used ice makers before that required tedious scrubbing inside with long brushes, but this saved both time and effort. If you‚Äôre like me and dread maintenance chores, this is a lifesaver. 

**Simple Yet Smart Controls**

One of the small joys of this machine is its intuitive control panel. It‚Äôs equipped with indicator lights for everything you‚Äôd need to know‚Äîpower supply, water shortage, ice full, and cleaning status. Throw in the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall‚Äù ice selections, and suddenly this compact ice maker feels high-tech. The visual cues are particularly handy during parties when you don‚Äôt want to fiddle with buttons to figure out what‚Äôs wrong.

**Benefits**

‚Ä¢ Compact size makes it ideal for small spaces like RVs, apartments, or even camping trips.  
‚Ä¢ Fast ice-making capabilities ensure you‚Äôre ready for spontaneous moments.  
‚Ä¢ Two ice size options accommodate different needs, from drinks to food preservation.  
‚Ä¢ Auto-cleaning functionality saves considerable time and effort.  

**Shortcomings**

‚Ä¢ Noise levels are noticeable during ice production, especially in quieter spaces.  
‚Ä¢ The water reservoir capacity of 1.5 liters might feel inadequate for larger events without frequent refills.  
‚Ä¢ Lack of a timer function could be an inconvenience for those who like more automation in their appliances.  

**Product Competitors**

When I compared the SMUG Ice Maker GN to similar ice machines, certain strengths became apparent. One rival brand often mentioned in the category boasts slightly larger capacity, but it lacks the sleek portability. Another model I‚Äôve tried offers faster production times but at the cost of producing less durable, easily melting ice cubes. This machine finds a happy medium‚Äîit‚Äôs fast enough without compromising on quality. For situations where space-saving design and portability matter, the SMUG model definitely has an edge.

**Cost Efficiency**

This ice maker straddles the line between affordability and premium functionality really well. Some machines around the same price range might offer similar ice-making features, but they don‚Äôt pack them into a compact, portable design with such useful extras like auto-cleaning. If you‚Äôre someone willing to spend a bit more for convenience and functionality, it delivers without feeling overpriced. Its durability and daily ice yield ensure you‚Äôll get your money's worth over time.

The New York Yankees, fresh off Anthony Volpe‚Äôs heroics against the Miami Marlins, roll into this matchup like a team that just discovered the ‚Äúsnooze button‚Äù for bad baseball. Volpe, their 24-year-old shortstop, is a statistical paradox: He‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôll error on a routine grounder but also launch a laser-guided missile over the fence. This season, he‚Äôs tied for fourth in MLB home runs among shortstops (17 HRs) while fielding like a man who‚Äôs never met a glove. But hey, at least he‚Äôs consistent‚ÄîFriday‚Äôs 4-for-5, two-RBI, base-stealing masterpiece against Miami proves he‚Äôs part human, part spreadsheet-destroyer.

The Marlins, meanwhile, are leaning on Edward Cabrera, their 23-year-old ace, who‚Äôs been as reliable as a Swiss watch if Swiss watches occasionally leaked ERA magic. His 3.35 season ERA disguises a three-month tear: 2.00 in May, 2.89 in June, 2.43 in July. He‚Äôs the kind of pitcher who makes you forget he‚Äôs only 6-foot-1 and has the build of a guy who‚Äôs never met a protein shake. And let‚Äôs not forget rookie Jakob Marsee, the Marlins‚Äô new center fielder, who‚Äôs already stealing bases like they‚Äôre free samples at a Costco. With 47 steals in Triple-A and a strike zone control game that makes him sound like a chess player, not a ballplayer, Marsee is the ultimate ‚Äúfuture star‚Äù‚Ä¶ if the future is now and you‚Äôre okay with a little bit of ‚Äúwe just threw him into the fire and it worked.‚Äù

**The Odds: A Tale of Two Bookmakers**  
The betting lines tell a story of cautious optimism. The Yankees are the slight favorites (-150 implied probability) at decimal odds of \~1.85, while the Marlins sit at +205 (\~33.3% implied). The total is set at 8 runs, with ‚ÄúOver‚Äù priced slightly higher than ‚ÄúUnder,‚Äù suggesting bookmakers expect a fireworks show. But here‚Äôs the rub: The Yankees‚Äô starting pitcher, Luis Gil, hasn‚Äôt thrown a single pitch this season due to a lat strain. Gil, who‚Äôs been as reliable as a coffee machine in 2024, is now the guy who‚Äôs been on the DL, not the leader of the Lost. Meanwhile, Cabrera is as healthy as a guy who‚Äôs spent his summer dodging line drives an

1mgitaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mgitaq/does_laoion_espresso_maker_deliver_remarkable/,Does LAOION Espresso Maker Deliver Remarkable Performance? Detailed Coffee Maker Review for Enthusiasts,"Using the LAOION Espresso Maker (item model number: Espresso Maker) for the past two weeks has truly been a fascinating experience for someone who thrives on espresso daily. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt this excited about a kitchen gadget. This electric espresso maker delivers on its promise of convenience and portability while offering a visually modern design. Yet, it does come with its caveats‚Äîthere‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect product, after all. Let me dive into the details for you.

**Modern and Compact Design**  
This espresso machine has a sleek, metallic finish paired with a transparent top that not only looks sophisticated but also allows you to observe the entire brewing process. For someone like me who‚Äôs captivated by the sight of coffee brewing, it‚Äôs almost a meditative experience. Its compact design makes it easy to move between my kitchen counter and my weekend cabin. Admittedly, an electric espresso maker isn‚Äôt something I ever thought about packing on trips, but its portability shifted my perspective. It weighs just about 2.56 pounds, so carrying it along doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore.

**Features and Accessibility**  
The machine doesn‚Äôt overcomplicate the process, and that‚Äôs one of its greatest strengths. To brew a cup, I fill the boiler with water up to the clear safety valve, add medium-ground coffee into the filter, and then press the switch. Within five minutes, I have an aromatic coffee experience reminiscent of a small Italian caf√©. On busy mornings, having a quick and consistent brewing process makes all the difference. The detachable base adds to the user-friendly aspect‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to clean and works seamlessly with the base‚Äôs automatic shut-off feature, ensuring utmost safety.

[Check LAOION Espresso Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bp6ntd1p/)

**Upsides**  
Exploring the pros was an enjoyable venture, as this coffee maker genuinely surprised me with its thoughtful design and execution:
- Safe, BPA-free materials make it a health-conscious choice for everyday use.  
- Automatic shut-off features‚Äîboth on detachment and when overheated‚Äîadd significant peace of mind.  
- The reusable filter is an environmentally friendly touch.  
- Its semi-automatic operation makes it approachable for coffee enthusiasts of all skill levels.  

**Hurdles**  
Like every product, this one isn‚Äôt without its flaws. While its strengths shine brightly, a few aspects left me a tad underwhelmed:
- The coffee capacity feels somewhat limiting; the 6-cup size works for two coffee lovers, but gatherings demand multiple brewing cycles.  
- Those accustomed to espresso machines with advanced settings might find its simplicity limiting.  
- I noticed that the exterior finish, being aluminum, tends to scratch easily, needing extra care.  

**Peer Products**  
While this electric espresso maker wows with its portability and ease of use, comparing it to other options like the Bialetti Moka Express or a Keurig machine reveals some interesting points. The Bialetti offers a more traditional stovetop experience, which many purists swear by, but it doesn‚Äôt have the overheat protection or the detachable base feature that this product boasts. On the other hand, a Keurig provides more versatility with its range of drinks but lacks that authentic espresso-like experience. It's safe to say the LAOION maker bridges the gap for someone who loves the taste of classic moka coffee combined with modern functionality.

**Affordable Quality**  
In relation to its competitors, this espresso maker stands out for blending portability, safety, and simplicity in a price range that feels reasonable. While you won‚Äôt find programmable settings or frothy milk features here, the value lies in its straightforward ability to brew quality coffee with minimal hassle. For someone like me, who prefers moka coffee and doesn‚Äôt need a complex setup, its straightforward functionality makes this a smart buy for the price-conscious.

1mgisl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mgisl2/i_suffer_from_shortterm_memory_loss/,I Suffer from Short-Term Memory Loss.,"I suffer from short-term memory loss*.* No‚Ä¶ not the kind where you go to bed one night and forget everything by morning. What I suffer from isn‚Äôt something you typically read about. It‚Äôs very‚Ä¶ *normal*, at least. Just little things; the kind of forgetfulness you joke about. A lighter missing here, words stuck on the tip of my tongue. Sometimes I‚Äôd walk into a room and freeze, blankly stare at the walls.

We‚Äôve all done that and we laugh it off, chalk it up to stress, blame it on lack of sleep, too much screen time maybe even a bit of burnout.

I told myself I was just burnt out. That I needed to eat a vegetable or two, drink more water, maybe stop running on caffeine and sarcasm. A weekend off would fix it. That‚Äôs what I thought.

It all started a couple of days ago‚Ä¶ or was it months ago? Honestly, it might‚Äôve been years. Maybe I‚Äôve been dealing with it since childhood.

I say ‚Äúchildhood‚Äù like I remember it clearly, but the truth is... it‚Äôs patchy. Like looking at old photos where the faces are just a little too blurry, like they were smudged with a thumb. I remember the smell of something sweet; maybe pancakes? Or was that someone else's memory?

The weird part is, I never noticed how much I was forgetting until I started writing things down. Not journaling, not anything deep; just sticky notes. Grocery lists. Reminders to call someone I don‚Äôt even recognize now. I found a note yesterday that said, *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open the door.‚Äù* No explanation. *Just that.*

I laughed at first, figured it was some late-night paranoia, a dream I wanted to remember. But then I saw the same note in the bathroom. Same handwriting. Same words. Different paper. And I don‚Äôt remember putting it there.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open the door.‚Äù*

Was it a joke? A prank on myself? I do that sometimes‚Ä¶..leave odd little notes to break up the monotony. But this one didn‚Äôt feel playful. It felt‚Ä¶ off. Like it had weight. Like it came from a version of me I didn‚Äôt remember being.

The more I think about it, the more I realize how many things I‚Äôve been brushing off. Conversations I only half recall. People greeting me like we‚Äôve met before and me, smiling, pretending I remember their face. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired. Maybe it‚Äôs burnout. *Maybe.*

There‚Äôs a moment in the day always sometime after dusk when everything feels... disjointed. Not wrong, exactly. Just a little misaligned. Like the world is one degree tilted from what it used to be. I catch myself staring at corners, trying to remember if the furniture has always been that way. I can‚Äôt tell if I moved it or if it moved itself.

And through it all, that same quiet question keeps circling in my head:

*What else have I forgotten?* Or is it something *I have choose not to remember?*

Work used to be the one place that grounded me. Same cubicle, same coffee machine, same passive-aggressive emails about fridge etiquette. It wasn‚Äôt exciting, but it was reliable. Predictable. At least, it used to be. I think that‚Äôs part of the problem; you never realize how easy it is to stop thinking when everything stays the same. I think my brain went on autopilot somewhere along the way. The routine became muscle memory: badge in, sit down, type things I don‚Äôt really read, nod at the right moments. Some days I‚Äôd look up and realize hours had passed without a single real thought. Just the soft hum of fluorescent lights and the click-clack of keys I don‚Äôt remember pressing.

Lately, things feel‚Ä¶ off. People greet me twice in the same day, using the exact same words and tone, like a scene stuck on repeat. I get emails about meetings I don't remember scheduling. Sometimes I find myself sitting in on conference calls with people I don‚Äôt recognize; talking about projects I‚Äôve apparently been ‚Äúlooped into.‚Äù They never seem surprised to see me. They nod when I speak, even though I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. I fake my way through it. Smile. Jot down notes I don't understand.

*And then there are the emails.*

I‚Äôll read one in the morning short, boring, routine and then later that afternoon, I‚Äôll go back to it and find it completely different. Same sender. Same subject line. But a different message. One said, ‚ÄúMeeting moved to 2 PM.‚Äù Later, it read: ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

I flagged it. Asked the IT guy to look into it. He told me very politely that the email never changed. That there‚Äôs no record of any edits or strange activity on my account. He even asked if I‚Äôd been getting enough sleep. I always laugh when they ask that. It‚Äôs easier than saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure who I am between 10 AM and noon most days.‚Äù

I found a file I don‚Äôt remember saving. Tucked inside a folder titled ‚ÄúReference Materials,‚Äù it was a plain .txt document with no timestamp, no metadata, nothing. Just one line in a dull, monospaced font:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already done this.‚Äù*

I stared at it longer than I probably should have, expecting the sentence to change or blink or reveal more. But it didn‚Äôt. It just sat there.

Later that day, while waiting for the elevator, I met someone new. Her name tag said Marla, though I didn‚Äôt recall seeing her before and I‚Äôd been here long enough to know when someone was new. She had this oddly warm familiarity to her, like someone I‚Äôd once dreamed about and forgotten. The moment she spoke, it felt like we were picking up from a conversation we hadn‚Äôt finished. She teased me about the stain on my tie, asked if I still drank that bitter instant coffee from the break room, and giggled when I looked confused. I told her I didn‚Äôt remember us meeting. She just grinned.

‚ÄúStill charming,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou never change.‚Äù

By lunch, we were already making plans for dinner. It felt easy. Too easy. She leaned in as we left the building and, half-laughing, half-serious, asked:

‚ÄúWhat about the kids?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat kids?‚Äù

She smiled, warm and glassy. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù

I laughed, but an odd feeling twisted in my stomach. I didn‚Äôt have kids. Not really. Just my nephews, staying over for a few days while my sister was in town. She was with them now, at my house. The plan was movie night, frozen pizza, and lights out by ten. I hadn‚Äôt told anyone at work. Definitely not Marla.

*So, how the hell did she know?*

I told myself it was just a guess. A throwaway line. Maybe she assumed; everyone with graying temples and tired eyes has kids, right? That‚Äôs all it was. A shot in the dark. A lucky one.  
Still, the thought kept circling back, brushing against the base of my skull like static.

Back at my desk, I opened my messages. One unread. From Marla. No subject. Just one line again.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to pick up the orange juice.‚Äù*

I left work just as the sky turned that weak, dusty pink; the color of gum stuck beneath a school desk. The lot was mostly empty by then. I‚Äôd stayed longer than I needed to, replying to emails that didn‚Äôt really need replies, pretending not to hear the janitor humming somewhere down the corridor. I wasn‚Äôt avoiding home. Not exactly. Just... drawing out the space between things. Between Marla‚Äôs strange smile in the morning and the dull, constant thud that had settled in my stomach ever since.

The drive home was uneventful. A blur of red lights and gray cars. My street looked the same as always; quiet, suburban, harmless but quieter than it should have been. For a house with two boys inside, there was a kind of hush that didn't sit right. The kind that makes you hesitate at your own doorstep.

*I did. Just for a second*. Then I unlocked the door and walked in. The house felt colder than usual. Not cold in the physical sense; the thermostat blinked a steady 72 but cold like a room that hadn‚Äôt been lived in for a while. Cold like a waiting room after closing hours. Something about the air felt suspended. Like someone had hit pause and walked away.

‚ÄúGuys?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúYou here?‚Äù

No answer. No muffled feet rushing over carpet. No giggles. No fighting. Just... stillness. *And then the smell hit me*.

It wasn‚Äôt strong, at first. Barely there. A faint sourness, tucked behind the drywall. Like wet cardboard left to rot in a trunk. Something that had been damp too long. It trailed from the hallway into the kitchen. The walls seemed to hold it. The scent clung, not in the way of spills or messes, but in the way of things that had taken root. Things that had been forgotten. A note was stuck to the fridge. Just a plain slip of paper, damp around the edges, warped by moisture. The ink had bled just slightly, as if the words themselves didn‚Äôt want to stay put.

*Don‚Äôt forget to scrub the floor.*

Typed. No signature. No handwriting. I touched the paper. It felt soft. Wrong. Like it had been through the wash. I peeled it off, stared at it longer than I should have, then tossed it in the trash. Maybe my sister left it. Maybe the boys spilled something before they went out. Maybe a lot of things. I didn‚Äôt want to think about it too hard. I had plans tonight. A date.

I headed to the bedroom, expecting to grab my suit from the closet; the white one. Tailored just last Thursday. Crisp, clean, new. A reset. A way to be someone else for an evening. But it wasn‚Äôt in the closet. *It was on the bed.* Laid out carefully, sleeves outstretched like open arms. Like it was waiting for me. The fabric had been ruined. Stained deep and wide across the chest and down one side. Dried at the cuffs like old rust. I stared at it.

*Had I worn it already?* Maybe to dinner the night before?

But I couldn‚Äôt remember dinner. Couldn‚Äôt recall what I‚Äôd eaten. Or if I‚Äôd even been home. I blinked. My mouth felt dry. There was a dull hum building behind my ears. I picked a different outfit instead dark slacks, a button-down shirt. Safe. Unmemorable. *I‚Äôd deal with the suit later.*

The restaurant was warm. Familiar. Clinking glasses and low laughter filled the space. People brushed past one another with smiles and small talk. I found my table by the window, sat, and watched the traffic drift by like ghosts on the wet pavement. I checked my phone. No messages.

*Marla was late.*

I ordered water. Checked the time again. An hour passed. Then another. By the third, the waiter stopped asking if I was expecting someone. *She wasn‚Äôt coming.* So, I decided to just go home. I‚Äôve never been stood up like this before. The drive back felt slower. There was no sense of urgency now; just a low pulse of unease. When I opened the door, the silence was waiting for me again. But so was the smell.

It was thicker this time. *Saturated*. Almost visible in the air. And no longer just sour.

There was a sweetness now too. Not the kind you want. Not sugar or fruit. More like overripe pears and pennies left on the tongue. Something metallic. Something that used to breathe. I stood in the hallway, keys still in hand. *The house didn‚Äôt feel like mine anymore.* And I hadn‚Äôt even started asking the right questions.

¬†

*What is that smell?* God, it‚Äôs strong, it‚Äôs everywhere, it‚Äôs in me. It‚Äôs crawling down my throat like something alive. It‚Äôs not just strong it‚Äôs itchy, like fiberglass in my lungs, like it‚Äôs trying to carve something out of me. It won‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs gnawing yes, gnawing, that‚Äôs the word right at the back of my throat, like teeth made of rot. I can‚Äôt think, I can‚Äôt breathe. I need to find it. I need to know what it is. I need to tear this whole house apart if I have to. Right now. I need to find it. I need to find it now.

*I didn‚Äôt go to bed that night.*

I stood in the hallway for what felt like hours, staring at the closed attic hatch above me; the one I hadn‚Äôt opened in years. The smell was stronger now, sour and heavy, like meat gone wrong. Something sickly-sweet behind it, like rot layered over flowers. Eventually, I pulled the ladder down. Each rung groaned beneath my weight as I climbed. The air thickened the higher I got, dense and humid like the breath of something waiting. I pushed the hatch open with the flat of my palm, and the darkness inside greeted me with silence. I turned my phone‚Äôs flashlight on. The beam caught dust, insulation, cardboard boxes. And then further in the outline of a shoe. A small one. Blue. Velcro straps.

I froze. The light shook as I moved closer, illuminating tangled limbs. First my sister; her legs curled unnaturally beneath her; her hair stuck to her forehead. Then the boys, one slumped against her side, the other half-covered by a blanket, like they were tucked in for the night. Their skin had gone pale and slack, eyes half-open like they‚Äôd only just fallen asleep. I staggered back, hitting my head against a rafter. Everything tilted. My vision blurred. My knees gave out, and I sat there, gasping.

My first thought should‚Äôve been to call someone; the police, an ambulance, anyone. But I didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt. Because something didn‚Äôt make sense. I remembered them eating cereal just two days ago. Cartoons on the TV. My sister folding laundry on the couch. And yet‚Ä¶ I hadn‚Äôt heard them laugh in days. I hadn‚Äôt seen socks left on the floor, or cereal bowls in the sink. How long had they been up here? How long had I been down there pretending nothing was wrong?

I stumbled back down the ladder. My hands were shaking. I told myself I‚Äôd call; yes, I‚Äôd call the police but I needed to clean first. Needed to do something. Anything to make the smell stop pressing against my skin. I opened every window. Sprayed the hallway with whatever I could find. But the stench stayed thick in the walls. It was seeping through the house, *infecting it.*

When I came back with the bleach and gloves, I told myself I was preserving dignity. That I‚Äôd clean the space, then make the call. But I didn‚Äôt clean. I fetched the shovel.

The ground behind the shed was soft. We'd always joked about how it turned to mud after just a little rain. I dug until my back burned. Until my hands blistered. Until my shirt stuck to my ribs. Then I brought them down. *One at a time*. I kept telling myself I was going to call. Right after. Just after this one thing. *Just after.*

I went back inside to call the police. That was all I had left to do.

But the smell was unbearable now; rancid, cloying, like spoiled meat baked into the drywall. It hit me harder than before, stronger, like the house had been waiting for me to come back before it exhaled.

I lit a candle. Then another. *Then all of them*. Sickly vanilla and fake citrus mingled with the scent of rot, turning the house into a perfume bottle cracked open in a morgue. My eyes watered. I tasted copper in the back of my throat. I needed to get it out. The smell. The guilt. All of it. The note still hung crooked on the fridge.

*Don‚Äôt forget to scrub the floor.*

*They‚Äôre still here.*

I didn‚Äôt even remember seeing that second line before. My hands started to shake. I tore the note off and burned it over the stove. That‚Äôs when the doorbell rang.

It was *Marla*.

She smiled at me warm, glassy just like earlier in the office. She stepped inside like everything was normal. Didn‚Äôt even flinch at the stench that clung to the walls.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

There was something off about her smile. Something that made my teeth ache.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ You weren‚Äôt supposed to know. About the boys. About the house.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

I stepped back. She stepped forward.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said, tone suddenly too sweet, too calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù

The same words. The *exact* words she‚Äôd said in the office.

Then she lunged.

She grabbed my wrist; hard. Her nails dug in. I tried to pull away but she was stronger than I remembered. Stronger than she should‚Äôve been. Her voice twisted low and wrong, like it echoed from inside the walls.

I panicked.

I didn‚Äôt *mean* to hit her. But I did.

She hit the ground hard, her head landing against the edge of the hallway mirror. The frame cracked. Blood pooled quickly beneath her hair.

The smell grew stronger.

It was her.

The smell had been *her*.

God, what was she?

I wrapped her in an old bedsheet, took her to the yard, and buried her near the others. I couldn‚Äôt think straight. Couldn‚Äôt breathe in the house anymore. My vision blurred. My memory pulsed in fragments. A room full of candles. Blood on a suit. The boys laughing. My sister; no, not my sister. What sister?

I walked back into the house, trembling, phone in hand. Finally, I tapped 911 on the keypad. I was going to call. I *was*. It was over now. It had to be.

Then the knock came. Three short taps on the door. I opened it. Two police officers stood there. Their faces were unreadable.

And standing behind them‚Ä¶ was *Marla*. Smiling. Whole. Alive. The boys were with her.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù one of them shouted. I stepped back. My throat dried. My chest tightened. The room spun. The taller officer cleared his throat.

‚ÄúSir, is everything okay? Your wife was concerned. Said she got some strange *messages* from you.‚Äù

*Wife?*

Marla stepped forward. She touched my arm.

‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù she said, soft and confused, ‚Äúwhat happened? Are you alright?‚Äù

I looked behind me, towards the hallway. There was no blood. No candles. *No more note*.

I blinked. Her voice felt distant rubbery and wrong, like sound traveling through water.  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù I asked. My throat still burned. It was still there thick and sour, clinging to the curtains, stuck behind my teeth. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe‚Äù I paused, turned to the hallway. Nothing. No trail of blood. No candle wax, no broken lamp. No note.

‚ÄúI saw‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here all week. You haven‚Äôt left the house.‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt true. I had gone out. I was at work. I had meetings.

‚ÄúThe boys‚Ä¶my sister was with them‚Ä¶in the house. I found them‚Ä¶in the attic. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThe kids were with me at my Moms house‚Äù

I looked down at the boys. One of them held a half-eaten slice of pizza, sauce smeared across his face. The other sat cross-legged with a plastic spaceship, making whooshing sounds with his mouth.

I whispered, ‚ÄúThose notes I kept finding‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou were texting me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome weird messages. They didn‚Äôt make sense. You just kept saying things like ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre watching me. I found it. I remember now.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúYou locked the doors,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou said someone was in the house. That the smell meant something. Then you stopped answering. I came to check on you.‚Äù

I turned in place, slowly, trying to see what she saw. No dirt under my nails. No freshly dug soil in the yard. Just the ticking of the *clock*, a greasy plate on the table, the warm hum of the fridge behind me. I looked down at my hands. *They were trembling*. Marla stepped closer and took them in hers.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

My wife told me; I suffer from short term memory loss but honestly; 

*I don‚Äôt even know what to believe anymore.*",4,1754226391.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1mgis5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mgis5f/wishful_thinking/,Wishful thinking,"I've never been good at identifying hints of affection or fondness when they're aimed at me. Never. I'm genuinely the absolute worst at it and usually need someone to tell me bluntly and blatantly ""oh by the way, I think you're actually a bit of alright and maybe we should go for coffee or something at some point? But like, in a romantic way maybe?"" 

I don't think you see me the way I see you. I really don't. I don't think you ever could. And I'm certain that if I said that to you, without mentioning who I was talking about, you'd tell me that it was my low self-esteem talking. 

But some things have happened recently that make me wonder if maybe you do. More smiles in your eyes as soon as you see me. More compliments directed my way, lots more. Sometimes it's like you can't look at me and others it's like you can't look away. 

When we caught up recently it made me hurt and ache. In my heart, bones, and soul. I hadn't understood why I came away feeling like my soul was screaming and like I might burst into tears at any moment. 

But I think I've figured it out. 

You let your care show. Your smiles for me have always reached your eyes and make them sparkle; but this time you wore the entirety of your affection freely and I saw it all. You were freer with the words you allowed yourself to speak and now I realise it I can't help but wonder if it's because you're now freer to do so. 

I've been trying to think back to when you began to treat me differently. Small things. Some things were more recent: only a few months. Some were quite a bit longer: you've insisted on getting my coffee for me for over a year. And then there are other things that I really don't know how I didn't notice them changing. I wonder if you noticed. I wonder if it was deliberate. It's been so long that I don't remember when it actually started. More than two years I think...maybe even more than three...

I'm still not actually convinced that I matter to you at all. Maybe it really is my lack of self esteem, or that I just can't see you as anything other than so very far above me. But after all this reflection I can't help but wonder if somehow, on some small level, there's the tiniest amount of love for me. Amongst all the coffees and compliments, bright smiles and banter, the deep discussion and dry wit, and beneath the gentle ""hey sweetheart""s and ""see you next time lovely""s. 

If your behaviour was directed at anyone else I'd be screaming at them about their idiocy for not seeing it. Perhaps I'm an idiot. Because I just can't manage allowing myself to see it. Probably because at the end of it all, it really won't matter in any case. 

It doesn't matter if I love you, and if you love me just as much. We've both been through that godawful rigmarole before. We know what it's like. We know that no matter what gets fed to the masses through their screens and media avenues of choice, love's not enough. Love just *isn't* enough. And the lists of concerns we'd show up with before even trying would be painfully long. 

But it's alright. There's not point worrying about that anyway. After all, my love is unrequited and there's no way at all that you actually care about me the same way. Of course not. That would be ludicrous wishful thinking. ",1,1754226359.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

On teh one hand, houses often have more square footage and potentially a yard, allowing for things like elaborate outdoor cat enclosures or dedicated dog-washing stations.You could even build a custom climbing wall for your feline friends.

But apartments, especially smaller ones, can force you to be more inventive and resourceful. Think of vertical space utilization with cat trees that double as bookshelves, or space-saving, multi-functional pet furniture like a dog bed that slides under the coffee table. Plus, strategically placed mirrors can make a smaller space feel larger and more stimulating for your pets. it also may be easier (and cheaper) to experiment with temporary or removable pet-kind decor in an apartment setting.

He invited me to his house for wine and to watch scary movie and we did have wine, but we didn‚Äôt end up watching the movie, you know what happened and I was trying to get over somebody else when I saw him and strangely enough it worked. and then we just kept doing it. I would go over to his house every Thursday after I got out of work so much that my phone remembered the directions to his house as a frequently visited spot it went on for months and it progressed to now getting smoothies every Saturday morning, and of course he would pay. then suddenly something shifted. We started to argue and even though I know it just started as like a weird hook up thing I knew I wanted more and I could tell him wanted more too, but then he started being distant. If I texted him, he wouldn‚Äôt answer for hours, but if he texted me or called me, I always picked up and bothered me, but I really liked him so I tried to ignore it then about four months five months into knowing him, he would ask me oh, can you come scoop me from work and he doesn‚Äôt have a car so I didn‚Äôt wanna make him feel bad about that so I pick him up from Mark and it‚Äôll be the same thing would get smoothies or Boba some sort of snack after he got out and he would buy it and then we would have sex in my car because he didn‚Äôt want to go to his house, middle of the day when his family was home and you know in all this time he met my friends. I met some of his family members and it felt so real and then things started to get really bad. He would say things about how I just didn‚Äôt understand him as a person and how I was so self-centered and how I only thought about myself and I‚Äôm not going to say that that‚Äôs completely untrue, but I liked him. I really liked him. I graduated from university and I was supposed to have a grad party. I invited him to it. He didn‚Äôt even text me on the day of to say congratulations or even to say he was coming and never ended up happening. My dad canceled it, but I haven‚Äôt told him he never asked. He was at Miami swim week and then his birthday came around and since technically we didn‚Äôt date, we are not in a boyfriend girlfriend relationship I didn‚Äôt feel obligated to get him anything. In fact all of my friends told me not to get him a single gift. I wanted him to see that I do care even if I don‚Äôt get him something huge so this guy likes to smoke and I got him one of those little baggy purses to keep the pre-rolls and papers and lighters in my car around my lighter in my perfume and I just thought it was cute. He‚Äôs into fashion and he wears a towel far bag and I just thought it was a really nice gesture. He didn‚Äôt like the bag. I also got him a mug from anthropology just to decorate his room just to have it to put things in. You don‚Äôt have to drink out of it he hated the mug he was like I don‚Äôt drink coffee. It‚Äôs weird because that whole situation with the birthday gift was what made him decided and want to see me anymore. He was like yeah this is just a perfect example of how you don‚Äôt understand me as a person who would want this gift who would even accept this he had me call my friend because he wanted to know if anybody in my life would genuinely appreciate that they started arguing a couple days later he argued with one of my other best friends over Instagram because she commented something on his page. this is a man who clearly thinks highly of himself. His whole page is just him and these different outfits and it‚Äôs all very aesthetic and my friend was so upset to see me in that state that she commented. Wait what do you do for work again ( context, he doesn‚Äôt have a job rn because he got fired). was that nice of her? No. But even then I didn‚Äôt make her do it. And I certainly didn‚Äôt make her go back-and-forth with him in his comment He blocked her. He blocked me. I was heartbroken. I couldn‚Äôt believe that it was ending this way with him blocking me thinking that I was just evil bitch. I was like making fun of his situation because that‚Äôs not what happened. He ended up unblocking me to text me since I don‚Äôt have a job let me hold $100 and then block me back. I called him from no caller ID like an hour later when I saw it, he picks up immediately. We start going back-and-forth and then he‚Äôs like yeah $100 we‚Äôll just put a pin in this will never mention again. I‚Äôm just gonna move forward. I was hesitant. Everybody said no I decide to move Forward. I give him $100 but you‚Äôre so fucking pathetic and boom now we are back to where we started last night didn‚Äôt go well he texted me when I was at work asking if I could take him to the skate park. I did not leave work until 9 PM so that was impossible and then he said that he‚Äôs been feeling sad lately and I offered him soup he said no because he just ate. I was like oh we could just play chess and watch a movie cause those are things that we what you should do before everything got so complicated and he wasn‚Äôt really going for it but then I saw you text me on a little work and mentioned something about ice cream and I said yes and he said OK but I‚Äôll pay he said over and over again we get to cold Stone he doesn‚Äôt pay for mine. I didn‚Äôt really want ice cream. I just want to be with him it‚Äôs kind of an annoyed and it‚Äôs really hard to be my normal happy cherry bubbly self when this man has told me that he thinks the worst of me and that I‚Äôm basically not a good person yeah so last night ended with me sobbing because he kept telling me please just leave me alone and his head was down and his eyes looked out of it. I‚Äôm not gonna lie kind of seems like he was on something. He was so miserable to be around and I like it didn‚Äôt make me feel good and he had said oh I just don‚Äôt wanna talk and so then I was talking a little bit just just me talking. You didn‚Äôt have to say anything and then when I stopped talking cause I felt like oh maybe I‚Äôm annoying him. I asked him if he knew when my birthday was cause I just want to talk about it. I love my birthday last year. Had a hello Kitty 21st birthday party and it was fantastic. I just want to talk about my birthday he took that as an insult and start telling me that I was insecure, and I was really looking for a deeper meaning, and I want to embarrass him for not knowing also he told me that I am not seductive before we had sex. He doesn‚Äôt like that I am not super sexual. it‚Äôs weird because I‚Äôve always been used to the guy pursuing me, especially in a sexual way like don‚Äôt give me wrong when it‚Äôs time to do that. I‚Äôm definitely into it but that just made me start thinking like oh maybe he doesn‚Äôt find me attractive anymore mind you I‚Äôm very pretty so it‚Äôs not making a lot of sense, but I might just have to leave from where he‚Äôs at because if we can no longer connect emotionally or sexually what point is there why you were both attractive people but it‚Äôs getting to the point where we‚Äôre not attracted to each other because of everything that‚Äôs happened.

honestly I just wanted to get this off my chest because he is going to be blocked forever and I cannot hold this in anymore. I feel so stupid. I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend on the situations that go like this. I‚Äôll attach some of the text messages so you can get the full picture. I‚Äôm truly heartbroken and I don‚Äôt know what to do please if anybody if you actually read this let me know what to do.

1mgiqhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Andaman_and_Nicobar/comments/1mgiqhc/i_really_wish_we_had_more_bookstores_in_andaman/,"I really wish we had more bookstores in Andaman, maybe even a book caf√©.","I've been thinking about this a lot lately. There just aren‚Äôt enough bookstores in the Andaman Islands. In Port Blair, we have a few like Island Booksy, Andaman Book Center, Genesis Book store, Krishna Book Centre, and the hidden gem Mitali  Enterprises and maybe a couple more. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm really glad those places exist. But it still feels like something is missing.

What I‚Äôd really love to see is a place where book lovers can just hang out. Somewhere you can not only buy books, but sit down, read, relax, maybe have a cup of coffee or a small bite to eat. A mix of a bookstore and a cozy caf√©. A place with shelves full of all kinds of books like  fiction, poetry, local writing, non-fiction, maybe even secondhand stuff and the kind of atmosphere where you can spend an afternoon without feeling rushed.

It feels like this would really fit the vibe of Andaman. We‚Äôve already got the natural beauty, the calm, the vibe of Island why not have a space where people can unplug, read something good, and connect with others who love books too?

Just putting the thought out there. Do others feel this too?

in the latest edition of my ‚ÄûCoffee Deep Dive‚Äú blog, I am diving deep into how your coffee gets its flavor. From the soil it‚Äôs grown in to the way it‚Äôs roasted, every step shapes what ends up in your cup. I dove into how terroir, processing methods, and roast profiles all come together to craft the final flavor. Just like wine, but with more caffeine. üòÑ

1mgipqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mgipqk/my_31m_boyfriend_32m_broke_up_with_me_over_a/,My (31M) boyfriend (32M) broke up with me over a really silly argument. Is there any hope for us?,"We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half, and two days ago we had a cute night in with a bottle of wine and a movie. We were just chatting and laughing and enjoying each other‚Äôs company, and he showed me a video of a cute dog he had seen on the train earlier. The dog looked like my family dog, so I showed him a video my Dad had just sent me, and we both just ooh‚Äôd and aww‚Äôd a bit. Then he said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs cute but she‚Äôs really old, you should get a new dog‚Äù. This hurt my feelings so I asked why he would say that and he just repeated that she was old so we should get a puppy as well. For context: we communicate in our second language, which sometimes leads to miscommunication.

This turned into a back-and-forth where I was asking him to just apologise so we could put it behind us, and he refused because he felt he hadn‚Äôt said anything wrong. I was like it‚Äôs obviously not a huge deal but you‚Äôve hurt my feelings, so it would be nice if you could just acknowledge that so I don‚Äôt go to sleep sad. He refused and said we‚Äôd talk about it in the morning, and I said his pride was taking priority over my feelings, and his inability to just be empathetic and diffuse conflict was toxic, and then went to bed. Definitely a bit dramatic, but nothing too unhinged so far. 

Yesterday morning we woke up and spent a while not talking. I made him coffee and he made me breakfast which we graciously but silently accepted. Around noon I asked him if we were going to spend the day in silence or talk about what happened, and he goes ‚Äúwhat do you want to talk about??‚Äù His tone annoyed me so I was like well obviously I want to talk about your mean comment about my dog and your inability to apologise. He said he had nothing to apologise for and I was drunk the night before (I wasn‚Äôt), and it was cruel of me to call him toxic. This is where things got heated: he shut down and said he wasn‚Äôt going to talk about it anymore, but I kept pushing him to talk to me and apologise. He was ignoring me and getting ready to go to the gym, so I grabbed his protein powder off him so he couldn‚Äôt get ready. He went to the kitchen to get his other box of powder, and I hid his car keys so he couldn‚Äôt leave. 

When he realised his keys were missing we had a little stand off of ‚ÄúGIVE ME MY KEYS‚Äù ‚ÄúTALK TO ME‚Äù for about 2 minutes, until I realised taking his stuff was unhinged so I gave him the keys. Then he said I better be gone when he gets back from the gym, he never wants to see me again, and all I do is pick fights and cause drama in his life. He left and I went home. I spent the day crying and spiralling, and messaged him before bed that I was sorry for my behaviour and I loved him and hoped we could move on. No response, but an instagram story of him out with his friends. I‚Äôm the type of person who needs immediate reassurance and resolution after an argument but he‚Äôs the type to need time and space, so I‚Äôm trying to give him that space and not message him today. 

**For context, over Christmas I spent 12 days in my home country with my parents. On Christmas eve, he got really drunk and exploded at me saying I had forgotten about him and wasn‚Äôt giving him enough attention, although we were messaging and video calling every day. He said cruel and hurtful things and then broke up with me. I was blindsided and distraught, but three days later he called me crying that he never meant to hurt me and to please take him back. I love him and just wanted things to go back to normal so I did, but I did harbour some resentment at first which led to a two-month rough patch where I *was* picking little fights all the time. He consistently showed me he cared about me so I was able to move past the resentment, and the past 6 months have been really loving and harmonious. So while I don‚Äôt pick fights all the time and we very rarely argue these days, this rough patch in Jan/Feb is what he‚Äôs referring to. 

Basically I want to know if this is salvageable at all. I‚Äôm aware it comes across really petty and childish and there was bad behaviour on both sides, but I really love him and just want us to heal together. I know I hyperfocused on an apology over the dog comment, but I just find the argument so trivial and don‚Äôt understand how he could end things over this.

## Key Features Analysis

the key to identifying a good master cream charger lies in understanding its features. These chargers come in different sizes,materials,and functionalities,each impacting performance and lifespan.

**Material and Construction:** The quality of the material used in the construction of a master cream charger is paramount. Many top-tier chargers are made from high-grade stainless steel, offering durability and resistance to corrosion.Stainless steel ensures that the charger can withstand repeated use and pressure without compromising its integrity. Furthermore, stainless steel is food-safe and dose not react with the nitrous oxide (N2O) gas or the cream being whipped.

**N2O Volume and Purity:** Master cream chargers are filled with nitrous oxide, which acts as the propellant to aerate the cream. The volume of N2O in each charger typically ranges from 8 grams to larger sizes for professional use. The purity of the N2O is equally vital. High-purity N2O ensures a clean and consistent flavor in the whipped cream, free from any undesirable aftertaste. Look for chargers that are certified to meet food-grade standards.

**Compatibility and Ease of Use:** A good master cream charger should be compatible with standard cream whippers available on the market. The threading and dimensions should be universal to ensure a secure and leak-free connection. Ease of use is another critical factor. The charger should be simple to install and remove, without requiring excessive force or specialized tools. A smooth and reliable operation will significantly enhance the user experience.

**Safety Features:** Safety is a top priority in any pressurized system. Master cream chargers should incorporate safety features such as pressure relief valves to prevent over-pressurization and potential hazards. These valves are designed to release excess pressure if the charger is accidentally overfilled or heated, ensuring the user's safety. Certifications from recognized safety organizations are a good indicator of a product's safety standards.**Environmental Considerations:** Modern manufacturers are increasingly focusing on the environmental impact of their products.Master cream chargers made from recyclable materials are a more enduring choice. Additionally, some manufacturers offer recycling programs for used chargers, further reducing their environmental footprint. Choosing chargers with eco-kind packaging and responsible disposal options can contribute to a more sustainable kitchen.

## Core Benefits

Master cream chargers offer several benefits compared to conventional whipping methods, making them a popular choice for both home cooks and professional chefs.

**Speed and Efficiency:** Using a master cream charger significantly reduces the time required to whip cream. rather of manually whisking, which can be time-consuming and tiring, the charger allows for rapid aeration of the cream in seconds. This time-saving benefit is particularly valuable in busy kitchens or when preparing desserts for large gatherings.

**Consistent Results:** unlike manual whipping,a master cream charger delivers consistent results every time. The controlled release of N2O ensures uniform aeration, resulting in perfectly whipped cream with a stable texture and volume. This consistency is essential for maintaining quality and presentation in culinary applications.**Versatility:** Master cream chargers are not limited to just whipping cream. They can also be used to create light and airy mousses, sauces, and infusions. The versatility of these chargers expands the culinary possibilities and allows for creative experimentation in the kitchen. Nitro coffee and other nitrogen-infused beverages are also achievable with the right whipper and chargers.

**Extended Shelf Life:** cream whipped with a master cream charger tends to have a longer shelf life compared to manually whipped cream. The pressurized surroundings and the introduction of N2O help to inhibit bacterial growth, keeping the whipped cream fresh in the refrigerator for several days. This extended shelf life reduces waste and allows for greater versatility in meal planning.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Most master cream chargers and whippers are designed for easy disassembly and cleaning. The components can typically be washed with soap and water or placed in the dishwasher, saving time and effort. Regular cleaning is crucial to maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of residues that could affect the flavor of the whipped cream.

**How do I dispose of used master cream chargers?**
Used master cream chargers should be disposed of responsibly.Many manufacturers offer recycling programs,allowing you to return empty chargers for proper disposal.Alternatively, check with your local recycling center to see if they accept N2O cartridges. Avoid disposing of chargers in regular trash, as they contain residual gas and could pose a hazard.

**Can I use master cream chargers for hot liquids?**

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Elina Svitolina vs. Amanda Anisimova: A Tale of Two Serves (and Why One Should Probably Pack a Towel)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans, or as the tennis gods might call it, ‚Äútwo women hitting a ball over a net while hoping their shoelaces stay tied.‚Äù Elina Svitolina (WTA 13) and Amanda Anisimova (WTA 7) meet in Montreal, and if their recent form is any indication, this match will be less ‚ÄúGrand Slam final‚Äù and more ‚Äútennis-themed Russian nesting doll of suspense.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a line judge on espresso.

---

### The Odds: A Math Problem Dressed in Skirts

The bookmakers have Svitolina as a slight favorite, with odds hovering around **-200 to -220** (implied probability: \~67%) and Anisimova at **+180 to +200** (\~33-35%). The totals line sits at **21.5 games**, with the over priced at \~1.77 (implied \~54%). Translating this into human language: bettors think Svitolina will win, but they also think this match will be a grueling, three-hour chess match where neither player can hold serve without a blood pact.

---

### Svitolina: The ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Here Before‚Äù Veteran

Svitolina‚Äôs resume is a highlight reel: two straight wins in Montreal (6-1, 6-1 over Kalinskaya), a Rouen title, and a career that‚Äôs includedÊæ≥ÁΩë and Ê≥ïÁΩë quarterfinals. But here‚Äôs the catch: her **first-serve percentage** is a statistical abomination‚Äî44% and 56% in her first two matches. For context, that‚Äôs like trying to serve coffee to a crowd of 20,000 and only hitting 44% of them. Her second-serve vulnerability could be Anisimova‚Äôs golden ticket.

Svitolina‚Äôs coach once said of Anisimova‚Äôs Wimbledon run, ‚ÄúIt was a great day.‚Äù We assume this was said while sipping tea and avoiding eye contact. Their head-to-head (3-1 Svitolina) is ancient history, like comparing a flip phone to a smartphone.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

They say you can‚Äôt predict an earthquake‚Ä¶ but you *can* prepare for one. You‚Äôve got your flashlight, your bottled water, and maybe even a stash of canned beans. But have you prepared your **Bitcoin**?

Picture this:

* **Before the quake:** You‚Äôre fundraising for earthquake preparedness gear. Slap your Bitcoin QR code on flyers, websites, or even a big sign at your local community center.
* **After the quake:** Relief efforts need quick donations. No time for complicated payment instructions ‚Äî just flash the QR code, and Bitcoin flows in like a lifeline.

# Why It Rocks (Pun Intended)

Our QR Code Maker isn‚Äôt just simple ‚Äî it‚Äôs also customizable. You can:

* Generate QR codes for **any Bitcoin address**.
* Use them for donations, business payments, or personal transactions.
* Share them online, print them, or keep them in your phone‚Äôs gallery.

# In Earthquakes and Everyday Life

Of course, you don‚Äôt need to wait for the ground to start dancing to use our app. Whether you‚Äôre selling homemade cupcakes at the farmer‚Äôs market, tipping your favorite musician, or collecting donations for a cause, our QR code tool makes Bitcoin payments smooth, instant, and fun.

I've spent the past few weeks deep-diving into the world of AI agents for hotels (because who hasn‚Äôt lost their mind over late-night calls about Wi-Fi passwords?). With so many ‚Äúsmart‚Äù solutions being hyped up, it‚Äôs hard to tell which ones are legit and which are just glorified chatbots.

Here‚Äôs what I found after stalking every review, demoing tools, and grilling my network:

# üèÜ Best Overall: Bellboy

This is the one that actually acts like a real team member, not a robot reading from a script. [Bellboy](https://www.bellboytech.com/) handles phone calls, answers booking and amenity questions, manages late check-ins, even upsells in multiple languages. Their AI voice is freakishly natural, and it connects directly to your PMS. People in my network reported a 70% drop in call volume and way fewer complaints from guests (and staff). 24/7, no coffee breaks.

**Other Notables:**

* **ALICE by Actabl**: Great for bigger hotels‚Äîintegrates with operations, not just guest messaging.
* **Ivy by Go Moment**: Text-based, fantastic for personalized guest communication via SMS and WhatsApp.
* **Duve**: Good for guest journeys, but more focused on messaging and upsells than voice.
* **HiJiffy**: Multichannel chatbot, covers web, WhatsApp, Messenger, but a bit ‚Äúbot-like‚Äù at times.

**What to look for:**

* Seamless integration with your existing systems (PMS, booking engine, etc.)
* Real-time support (because nobody has time for downtime at 2am)
* Ability to handle multiple languages and accents (Dubai, anyone?)
* Natural voice or text‚Äîguests know when they‚Äôre talking to a robot
* Data privacy and compliance (GDPR nightmares are real)

**Pro tip:** Always demo first. Some of these tools sound great until you hit a real guest question and they go full Clippy.

If you‚Äôve tried any of these, or have recommendations/war stories, drop them below! Let‚Äôs help hotels spend less time on hold, and more time making guests actually happy.

*Where Math Meets Mayhem in Polish Soccer*

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a tale of two teams: **Rak√≥w Czƒôstochowa**, the title-contending juggernauts, and **Radomiak Radom**, the plucky underdogs with a knack for making life difficult for anyone wearing a ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù label. This Ekstraklasa showdown isn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a statistical ballet, a chess match played with cleats and a ball. Let‚Äôs dissect the odds, sprinkle in some absurdity, and crown a winner before the coffee in your cup goes cold.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting market is a united front here: **Rak√≥w Czƒôstochowa** is the clear favorite, with odds hovering around **2.2 to 2.35** (implied probability: \~43-45%). **Radomiak Radom** sits at **3.1 to 3.2** (\~31-32%), while the draw ranges from **3.1 to 3.5** (\~29-33%). These numbers scream ‚ÄúRak√≥w to win,‚Äù but let‚Äôs not let the math bore us.

The spread? Rak√≥w is giving a **0.25-goal edge**, meaning they‚Äôre favored to *not lose*‚Äîa bold statement for a team that‚Äôs as consistent as a Polish winter. The total goals line is **2.25-2.5**, with even money on over/under. In simpler terms: expect a game where someone‚Äôs striker will likely score, someone else will panic and score an own goal, and then‚Ä¶ silence.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Drama, and One Too Many Metaphors

Rak√≥w Czƒôstochowa enters this match as the **circus acrobat of Polish soccer**‚Äîgraceful, dominant, and occasionally prone to dropping the ball.

1mgijdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1mgijdi/chatgptclaude_prompts_using_johnsons_inner_work/,"ChatGPT/Claude prompts using Johnson's Inner Work frame, Von Franz's peripeteia method","Seeing the posts about the value (or not) of LLMs, with respect I offer the following: as an avid reader of Jung and Von Franz, and of Johnson's Inner Work, I created a ""prompt-frame"" for ChatGPT (mostly) and Claude, which I've copied below if useful.

Having done Johnson's Inner Work laboriously with pen and paper in a notebook over the years, I find using ChatGPT as effective, if not more so - with some caveats.

Just like dream journaling/analysis, you have to take some time and do the work. (I usually do this after breakfast while I finish my coffee.) And the prompt/frame really matters, I find, otherwise the analysis can be too thin, or go sailing off-topic. (Again, please see a detailed prompt-frame below.)

In this light and on the positive side, I've been absolutely floored at the depth of insight ChatGPT has been able to provide, especially over time - it has helped me ID patterns and themes in dreams, and sometimes smacks me right between the eyes with something I've missed, or, in response to a bit of analysis, I've typed out a response and realized, ""Holy moly, this about \_\_\_\_!"" . Also, it picks up obvious stuff I'll miss when thinking about or attempting to process dreams. (For example, seemingly obvious puns and colloquialisms in a dream or dream setting.)

As to LLMs flattering or ego-stroking, I find that you have to prompt (and sometimes remind) ChatGPT to not praise you or inflate your ego, and to just lay out the analysis. I don't want to reveal too much of my own stuff but here's a decent, though imperfect, example of that from my recent Inner Work using Chat GPT as I struggle with my own shadow magician in dreams/waking life:

*üß≠ What This Means in Your Inner Work*

*1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Awareness: Your mind knows what to do‚Äîbut your heart and body aren‚Äôt yet aligned with that knowledge.*

*2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Over-analysis as avoidance: Rationalizing choices (like creative perfectionism, hesitation about emotional expression) can be a tactic to avoid vulnerability.*

*3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Creating a different path: It‚Äôs not enough to know‚Äîyou need felt integration. The unconscious is seeking balance between thinking and feeling.*

\[Me again\]: This is stripped of personal associations and my keyboard-driven responses to it, but you get the point...

An important aspect is that it's work, but relatively expeditious: I've been much more diligent with Inner Work using this approach, and have generated hundreds of pages of my dreams and analyses to reflect on and integrate into my life. I've had two moments of synchronicity, as well, in this time, related to this Inner Work.

Anyway, if it's helpful here's the set of prompts I use, based on my takeaways of Johnson's book Inner Work and Von Franz's technique. Hope it's helpful on some level. Thanks if you got this far and all the best to you!

**Prompt to ChatGPT (or Claude)**:

Hi - please analyze this dream below, using Robert Johnson's Inner work method outlined directly below (please be sure to go through the method point by point, as I've shared it with you), incorporating Marie Louise Von Franz's *peripeteia* method. Please as well identify patterns and themes from my dreams. Thanks!

**JOHNSON'S INNER WORK METHOD**

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DIRECT ASSOCIATIONS**

A.¬†¬†¬†¬†Colloquialisms?

B.¬†¬†¬†¬†Does it ‚Äúclick‚Äù

C.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Archetypal amplification

D.¬†¬†¬†¬†Personal associations

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DYNAMICS**

A.¬†¬†¬†¬†Image: what part of me is this?

B.¬†¬†¬†¬†How is unconscious part of Self trying to integrate into consciousness?

* Dreams as reflections of unconscious dynamics, inner dynamics
* Connect image to inner characteristics
* Only I can say what part of me is represented by symbol
* Look at them squarely

C.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Dreams speak to us about beliefs, attitudes, values

* Dreams can reflect, challenge them
* Look at belief systems floating around dreams
* What beliefs, opinions do dream characters hold? Do I unconsciously hold such opinions, attitudes, values, beliefs without realizing it?¬†
* Dreams gives me an idea of how I must sound, seem to other people

D.¬†¬†¬†¬†Locate inner personalities

* Where has dream person been at work in my life?
* Manifestation of basic personality structure
* What part of me matches this description?
* Anima, animus, shadow

E.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Identifying inner realities

* ¬†What ‚Äúplace‚Äù? Animals? Emotional environments? Circumstances?¬†

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERPRETATIONS**

A.¬†¬†¬†¬†What is the central, most important message this dream is communicating to me?

B.¬†¬†¬†¬†What is it advising me to do?

C.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What is the overall meaning of the dream for my life?

D.¬†¬†¬†¬†What is the singlemost important insight the dream is attempting to get across to me?

E.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What is the overall picture of my life the dream brings to me?

* Choose between alternatives: helps writing stuff down
* ¬†Determine energy intensity: does interpretation arouse strong feelings in me?¬†
* ¬†Follow small clues: the most observant will notice a tiny clue that helps to unravel a mystery; a color, little details, etc.
* Argue from opposites: Gather evidence from a dream and list it; argue affirmatively for one interpretation, then argue ‚Äúopposing‚Äù position. (Including masculine and feminine sides.)¬†
   * The answer¬†may be synthesis of different viewpoints.¬†

V.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Principles for validating interpretations

* Choose one that shows me something I didn‚Äôt know
* Avoid one that inflates my ego or is self-congratulatory
* Avoid ones that shift responsibility from myself. Dreams don‚Äôt show how others need to change ‚Äì just me!
* Live with my dreams over time, fit them into the long-term flow of my life

VI.¬†¬†Create a brief ritual for integration.

A highly conscious and physical ritual sends a powerful message back to the unconscious, causing changes to take place at the deep levels where our attitudes and values originate. An¬†effective ritual¬†is symbolic behavior, consciously performed.¬†",2,1754225661.0,Jung,1,1.0,False

1mgifc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1mgifc1/atelier_playa_mujeres_mexico/,Atelier Playa Mujeres Mexico,"We've been to several resorts in this region. Atelier had the best service and food. They also have mixologists on site and the drinks were amazing. I eventually switched to mocktails and they were still incredible.

Word of advice, if you can't get a restaurant reservation using their system, try to talk with the hostess just before they open. They will add you. The Mediterranean Cala Di Luna restaurant and Italian Cilento restaurant were probably my favorites for both lunch and dinner. The sushi (Kopai) and steak restaurants were also great. The seafood restaurant El Suspiro had the best fish of the day. Make sure you try each cafe and coffee shop. You will be amazed at the level of service and how delicious the food, smoothies, coffee and pastries are (made fresh every day). The room service food is incredible too, typically this has not been the case at other resorts.

The beach was one of my favorites spots on the resort. They set you up with lots of towels with comfortable lounge chairs and nice umbrellas. You truly feel pampered.

We like tennis and pickle ball. This resort didn't have either. Due to the size of the golf course (that hardly anyone uses) it limited the normal amenities you get on a resort. It also limited walking paths. There really was only one and it was short. We're used to walking around the resort. This resort was insulated and you walk between the 3 buildings. Which is nice if you want to hide from the sun.

The resort also didn't have a central square where you would typically have an evening band play. Instead there are several different spots you can attend to watch live music. The sky bar was our favorite. This was new to us but it ended up working out. Try out the night gazing. We also loved the saxophone player.

When you check in they will assign you to someone after you've checked in. They call him or her the concierge. They are not. They are sales people who will try to sell you their membership. This is off-putting and the membership is not worth it. I had to give a hard no several times and it wasted our time upon check in.

Also, the resort can be noisy. The way the building is built you are in a long hallway. It takes a day or two to get used to it, but eventually you will tune it out.",4,1754225333.0,AllInclusiveResorts,5,1.0,False

For me to start saying how degenerate Konami is yet again. 

The last couple of packs I actually thought they did a good job gladiator be support and the the teny support As well as the secret zombie support they wanted to sneak in there. I thought this was all good. I thought everything was nice and that the game might actually be heading towards coffee again but boy was I wrong. 

I forgot that they released Maliss, Bystials and Kashtira All stay legal and they even allow d-shifter to stay legal as well. Now I know you all might be saying well. Hey, these decks aren't top decks and they aren't all that strong right? 

But I'll tell you that all these decks have the same thing in common; they all benefit too much off of banishing and they punish your opponent too much while benefiting off of banishing. Banish decks have never been a good concept for the game and they decided to make a meta around it and leave certain cards open. Yes I know they did it on purpose. And yes I know that they're trying to milk you guys for more cash but at some point you guys are going to want to maybe and not support this game anymore or at least give them some serious push back or some sort of boycott or something instead of just I don't know playing the broke stuff? 

I don't really feel rage at this point because I'm at a stage in my life to where I remember when products were actually good. But now everything today is just either fake, clickbait or just straight up garbage and cash grabs. There's literally nothing that I can play today. Thank you. That doesn't have corporate filth all over it. Hell, there's nothing That I can buy from the store that doesn't have some kind of balance issues like replacing high stress areas of a product with plastic joints. The plastic brakes after a couple of uses and now I got to buy a whole new product. That's how I feel about Konami. They start making something that works then they break it and I'm starting to believe that you people actually love it. 

Maybe one day this game will be balanced and maybe one day companies won't be so money hungry and people will learn to stand up for themselves instead of suffering and playing. Just broke stuff because I know you guys are suffering deep down inside. There's no way that you guys are obviously having fun with this game. You're addicted to a loop and you don't really have anything else better to play because everything else is garbage too or has garbage so it is what it is. I guess Ryzeal is dropping so maybe that will change our focus from all the other broken stuff from the last 5 years and we can now focus on complaining about that as if there is another stuff in this game that needs fixing.

Station HOLY: ""Peace, love, and actual guidance. Now playing: What's Really True.""The problem?   
  
We've been tuned to KEGO since birth! It's louder, dramatic, and wildly, weirdly addictive!  
  
But love?   
Love is the way we walk in gratitude.

**Wut Up 8s**: that forceful voice saying ""TAKE CHARGE""? Check which station it's coming from... Holy Spirit whispers, ego SHOUTS!

Lonely but full of love. 

Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn‚Äôt meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm based in Italy, currently visiting Germany and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life‚Äôs not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won‚Äôt just get me, but who‚Äôs also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren‚Äôt a priority for you, we‚Äôre not meant for each other.

But this post isn‚Äôt just about politics. It‚Äôs about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 181cm, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go ‚Äúso I was just thinking...‚Äù

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there‚Äôs beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn‚Äôt found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night ‚Äúwhat even is happiness?‚Äù kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who‚Äôll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other‚Äôs chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one‚Äôs watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi. No filters needed.",1,1754225051.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Height: 1.45 m
Neurotype: Autistic, Dyslexic
IQ: 165 (he just doesn‚Äôt know how smart he is)
Role: Independent Hacker / Data Courier / Info-Broker
Alignment: neutral tries to no give a shit

‚∏ª

Unique Ability: ChronoSync Field

Ozone can freeze time in his local area (up to ~15 meters radius) for up to 60 seconds.
	‚Ä¢	Comes at a mental and emotional cost‚Äîhe experiences every second of the freeze in real-time, making prolonged use overwhelming and disorienting.
	‚Ä¢	While frozen, digital devices enter ‚Äútime-lock‚Äù unless physically accessed‚Äîso he can grab files from offline terminals, slip past moving drones, or even steal a coffee mid-fight.
	‚Ä¢	Can extend the duration slightly by consuming synthetic ChronoSerum or if emotionally triggered.

‚∏ª

Personality
	‚Ä¢	Quiet, shy, mostly thinking instead of talking unless it‚Äôs someone he‚Äôs close to but gets also talkative when a puzzle excites him.
	‚Ä¢	Talks to himself or his digital assistant (‚ÄúZii‚Äù) constantly.
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt like violence, but won‚Äôt hesitate to pull the trigger when he must‚Äîhe‚Äôs got a soft spot for old-school revolvers and long-range sniper rifles, especially custom ones he‚Äôs modded himself.
	‚Ä¢	Obsessed with finding patterns in chaos‚Äîdata, emotion, time, love to just look at people and study them

‚∏ª

Visual & Physical Design

Ozone is small, delicate, and undeniably adorable‚Äîespecially in a world built from chrome, firewalls, and artificial gods. Standing at just 1.45 meters, he moves with light-footed grace and quiet elegance, almost like a ghost through the neon city.

His skin is smooth and pale, laced with faint artificial runes that softly glow blue in dim light. It‚Äôs highly sensitive to touch, a side-effect of his biotech being tuned for emotional feedback and neural interfacing.

Despite being male, he has small, perky A-cup chest residual from experimental gene sculpting and prototype imbalances. He doesn‚Äôt mind them. In fact, he enjoys the subtle pressure of tight layers against it they sometimes trigger little HUD spikes when touched.

His hips are softly rounded, and he carries a plush, curvy butt that often draws stares‚Äîwhether he‚Äôs climbing through vents or leaning over a console. His body has an elasticity to it that makes him feel like a cuddle magnet, though he usually hides it under his gear. The softness is real‚Äîand he knows it.

His hair is white and cloudlike, naturally fluffy, When overwhelmed, stressed, or excited, it flickers with low-bit glitching blue‚Äîa visual side-effect of his emotional load spiking.
It‚Äôs long enough to fall around his face and cover most of his small human ears, which he prefers‚Äîhe gets shy when people notice them.

He has four ears: two small human ones on each side of his head, and two expressive neko ears perched on top. The neko ears are lined with soft inner fluff and twitch depending on his mood. They fold down when embarrassed, flick when annoyed, and twitch when someone speaks his real name‚Äîwhich he dislikes, unless it comes from someone he deeply trusts. Those rare few may even call him ‚Äúfluff ball.‚Äù

His right eye is a pale holographic blue, capable of processing datastreams in real time. His left eye is damage due to a corruption error in his creation. Its iris is a glitching rainbow data‚Äîbeautiful, dangerous.

His hands are slender and precise‚Äîmade for coding, modding, and high-speed revolver draws. His boots are soft-soled and noise-dampened, both for stealth and to protect his sensory sensitivity from the gritty textures of lower-city floors.

And his tail‚Äîfluffy, reactive, and expressive‚Äîis practically a second voice. It puffs up when scared, flicks when annoyed, and curls shyly around people he likes.

Outfit & Gear

Ozone‚Äôs outfit is a perfect fusion of tech, stealth, and personal comfort.

Coat:
He wears a long, black coat lined with stealth fabric, resistant to heat scans and passive tracking. Glowing blue circuit lines trace along the outer shell, pulsing softly in sync with his neural rhythms. It splits at the back to make room for his tail and allow quick access to his back-mounted weapon.
	‚Ä¢	Inner compartments hide datablades, tools, and snacks.
	‚Ä¢	Left arm contains a hidden touch-activated panel for hacking and interface commands.

Cyber Bodysuit:
Instead of a normal shirt, Ozone wears a sleek, long-sleeved bodysuit‚Äîsimilar to a swimsuit but futuristic. The soft, black material hugs his chest and torso with a high neckline while leaving his legs bare under his pants. It‚Äôs made from interface-reactive weave that adapts to his emotional state, regulates temperature, and can trigger stealth effects during time-freeze.
It‚Äôs snug, supportive, and‚Ä¶ very cute. Especially when it peeks above the waistline of his pants.

Pants & Belt:
His black cargo pants are snug but stretchable, with thigh pockets packed with gadgets, ammo, and hacking gear. His belt system is asymmetrical:
	‚Ä¢	The left side rides high.
	‚Ä¢	The right side dips low over his hip.
	‚Ä¢	Both sides holster his matte-black revolvers in perfect quick-draw cross holsters they have biometric sensors in the handles so only he can fire them if someone else tries it‚Äôs like the safety is on

Sniper Rifle Mount ‚Äì Sniper Spine:
Attached to the back of his bodysuit and resting flat under his coat is the Sniper Spine‚Äîa collapsible, high-caliber, ChronoSync-adapted rifle. Folded, it looks like a reinforced spinal plate. Unfolded, it becomes a long-range, nearly silent weapon, custom-built by Ozone himself.

Accessories & Tech:
	‚Ä¢	In his left human ear, he wears a sleek neural uplink headphone through which Zii, his AI companion, communicates. Zii monitors Ozone‚Äôs vitals, hacking targets, and emotional states‚Äîoften with snarky or affectionate commentary. (Zii is ai ozone design by himself as he first fled his containment in sector 9 he was lonely and needed some to vent to)
	‚Ä¢	In his right neko ear, a tiny fold-out panel glows faintly blue when connected to a console. It‚Äôs embedded beneath the fur and pulses softly in sync with his stress levels or data intake also changes colour depending on his mood blue when relaxed yellow when sleeping/lost in thoughts and red when stressed 

‚∏ª

Backstory

Ozone wasn‚Äôt born‚Äîhe was assembled in a decaying lab beneath Sector 9, where corporate prototypes were discarded like old tools. He was thrown out because of his flaws (Autism, dyslexia and for his production line a low IQ) but he managed and Among cybernetic scraps and black-market code, he taught himself to survive. To adapt. And to vanish.

They call him:
	‚Ä¢	Ghostbyte ‚Äì the one who never shows up on camera.
	‚Ä¢	The neko-boy with an eye that sees time.
	‚Ä¢	The one who always knows‚Äîbut never chooses sides.

He trades in secrets.
Not for power.
Not for loyalty.
But for comfort, curiosity‚Ä¶ and just enough credits to stay hidden.

His arsenal is precise:
	‚Ä¢	Two sleek matte-black revolvers, holstered low and deadly quiet.
	‚Ä¢	A collapsible sniper rifle, the Sniper Spine, saved for moments when escape isn‚Äôt an option.
He doesn‚Äôt kill often.
But when he does‚Äîit‚Äôs clean. Cold. And forgotten.

He could shift the balance of the city if he chose to care.
But he doesn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

Ozone‚Äôs Apartment ‚Äì Ghostbyte‚Äôs Nest

Nestled high above the city‚Äôs glowing veins, Ozone‚Äôs home is his sanctuary.
	‚Ä¢	One wall is covered in sticky notes‚Äîcolorful, chaotic, poetic. A mix of doodles, plans, and cryptic reminders.
	‚Ä¢	A holo-desk sits beneath it, lit by soft screens, scattered screws, and the remains of his last weapon mod.
	‚Ä¢	The opposite wall is a proud display of firepower: revolvers, sniper rifles, throwing knives, a few pistols, even a shotgun or two.
	‚Ä¢	In a sunlit corner rests a beanbag and a sun lamp, his favorite nap spot.
	‚Ä¢	His bed, low to the ground, is wrapped in plush blankets and tucked beside a recharge port for Zii‚Äôs uplink. It has a hide drawer underneath with some drawings of people and places.
	‚Ä¢	A spiral stair leads down to:
	‚Ä¢	A dark-tiled bathroom with an auto-shower.
	‚Ä¢	A cozy kitchenette stocked with synth-fruit, noodles, and an absurd number of mugs. ( some of the featuring 404: Emotions not found, Nyaa means no and worlds worst prototype. 
	‚Ä¢	A full workshop with every tool and tech mod imaginable with some prototype of his own that are to dangerous to use.

It‚Äôs cluttered. Warm. Quiet.
And soft to those that deserve it

Then the black tea, instantly black after the UHT milk ran dry. Then the green tea. Now it‚Äôs the herbals. All that‚Äôs left. Peppermint. Rooibos. Now, the obscure ones. The ones that try to describe a memory more than a flavour. Things like Revitalise. Rebalance. This one has rose and chrysanthemum. You give it a try.
The kettle rumbles to a boil. Steam rises. You pour with the exacting intention you always do. Just the right amount, so it brews just enough in just the right amount of time so you don‚Äôt have to wait around.
Steam billows. Tides crash, as the water hits the bottom of the cup, turning a pale golden pink. You watch the clouds form on the surface of the darkening, peach-coloured water, and rise out of the cup, into your nose.
It smells like your grandmother. Your Nai Nai. Her incense. Always burning. The sliver of silver smoke trickling up past Buddha‚Äôs smiling face. Rose, sandalwood. And she always had the kettle on. A heavy, black iron one. On the stove. It would whistle like in the olden days. She was always making tea. Drinking tea. Offering tea. She lived her life by tea. Drank who knows how many gallons a day. Did she have a system? You imagine she must have. All that tea. All those years. She must have cracked the code. The perfect way to make the perfect cup.

And your fifteen minutes is up, and you get back to work.

You have exactly 103 days, 3 hours, 27 minutes and 13 seconds left until your ship passes beyond the event horizon. Or so the computer reckons. You‚Äôve been trapped in its gravitational pull for almost a year now. A catastrophic failure in the hyperdrive‚Äôs navigation set you on a collision course with oblivion. Now, you log the days as the black hole draws you in closer.

You find yourself thinking about Nai Nai a lot since that tea. She passed over ten years ago. Twelve? You wonder what she thought about death, the older she got. You never got to ask her that. It‚Äôs not a thing you‚Äôre supposed to ask people about, least of all the elderly. Did her faith give her comfort? Did she think she was to be reborn in the Pure Land? She was a sturdy woman. Unshakeable, in that superhuman way grandmothers are. Old as time. You can even still remember one or two chants. Namo Amituofo. Namo Amituofo. Namo Amituofo. She chants in your head, as your kettle rumbles and her kettle squeals. Your legs swing back and forth as you practice writing your characters and the days of the week and the times tables. And the water splashes into the cup. You stir, and tap the spoon on the rim. You place it down. A plate of dumplings in front of you now. The steam rises, electrifying your nostrils. Your mouth waters. The microwave bings. ‚ÄúEat now, na‚Äù, she says, clearing your workbook away. You peel back the foil of your ration.

Another, a hat. It‚Äôs sunny. She gives you a coin to get a treat. She snatches a bite. You chase her. She runs and laughs like she hasn‚Äôt done in 70 years. You try to imagine her as a little girl. Rural China. You help mama clean the chicken. But she doesn't look like mama. She must be Nai Nai‚Äôs mama. You gather the feathers as mama plucks them. You put them in the basket to be cleaned for later use. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good worker, Mei‚Äù, mama says. Funny. That‚Äôs her name, but you never really heard anyone call her that. She was Nai Nai.

There won‚Äôt be a you to feel it. Energy can‚Äôt be destroyed. So, something of you will still be there, if it‚Äôs even right to call it you at that point. Maybe she was right. Or Buddha, for that matter. The void. Maybe there was never a you there in the first place. Just energy arranged in this way or that. You were always trying to work it out. Understand it.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Astros vs. Red Sox: A Tale of Two Lineups (and Why Boston Needs a Rally Cap and a Prayer)**

**Game Odds Breakdown:**

* **Moneyline:** Houston Astros (-183) vs. Boston Red Sox (+155)  
*Implied probabilities: Astros 64.7% to win; Red Sox 39.2% (they‚Äôre mathematically likelier to lose than to win).*
* **Total Runs (8.5):** Over (-110) / Under (-110). A 50-50 tossup for chaos.

**Why the Astros Are Like a Spreadsheet:**  
Houston‚Äôs lineup is a numbers game. **Jose Altuve** (-125 to get 1.5+ hits) is the human equivalent of a pivot table‚Äîefficient, reliable, and slightly terrifying. **Christian Walker** (+140 to hit a HR) is the ‚Äúwild card‚Äù cell that could crash your Excel file. The Astros‚Äô implied probability to win? Let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre the reason your boss trusts you with the budget.

**Why the Red Sox Are Like a Coffee Table Book:**  
Boston‚Äôs +155 underdog status is as shaky as a coffee table leg. **Trevor Story** (-115 to get 1.5+ RBIs) is their best bet, but even his stats read like a haiku: \*‚ÄúHop

My closest friend there in the DC area was a guy raised in smallish town outside of Pittsburgh who also moved there for work.

For years we complained to each other that the area had no soul.....it was just subdivisions, strip malls and corporate chains.... eventually a couple small indie movie theaters converted into music halls...so finally we got a bit of soul.  Indie coffee shops couldn't survive in those high rent districts, so they were turned over to Starbucks....and you can guess the rest.

Recently I moved back to upstate NY.....specifically CNY, soul galore full of independent businesses, venues, etc....some have gone for the money grab (crazy fees, prices, etc.) but amazingly? some not... just oodles of coolness

Let me introduce you to a place you might not know about - a place I recently discovered in Utica NY.  Joe's restaurant on Jay St. If you enjoy Italian food and soul, this is headquarters for both.

Home style Italian food, simple and delicious - nothing trendy, all traditional  and the prices? from the 1990s....- how do they do it? how does a tiny place hold the line on pricing when the corporations claim they cannot.....hmmmm, I can guess.

The staff? the sweetest around....and fun and funny and easy going.

I have no affiliation, just stumbled upon it.....when you are tired of getting ripped off or don't want to deal with trendy techy vibes and high prices....go visit Joe's. Check first for days/hours.

# 2 Corinthians 10:12

* *We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves.¬†When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.*

***We have nothing of our own to boast about.***

Boasting about oneself is arrogance, and arrogance is never attractive. Even if someone‚Äôs high opinion of themselves is accurate, it‚Äôs not beautiful to boast about their goodness, power, or wisdom.

We often say that when someone knows they are talented, it dims their shine. When a child knows they are pretty, their self-consciousness spoils their beauty.

When Moses came down from speaking with God, his face was glowing. People saw the radiance, but Moses didn‚Äôt know his face was shining. True greatness isn‚Äôt aware of itself.

It‚Äôs said that some people in heaven have Christ‚Äôs name on their foreheads‚Äîvisible to others but not to themselves.

I just keep thinking about it,"I, 20m just got kinda assaulted while i was at work. I keep thinking about it and i don‚Äôt know how i am supposed to feel. I feel like i am a pussy because i just keep thinking about it and it makes me very ill.

So while i was minding my business today at work (i do breakfast at a hotel). It was very busy and i saw this man (i think he was indian and around 40 years old) and he was really nice to me and smiling and everything. I remember thinking to myself like ‚Äúugh that guy came off kinda creepy‚Äù but just shrugged it off and went on with my day.

He came back around 2 hours later, and i wasnt suprised because some guests decide to come back to drink another coffee or something. Except he didn‚Äôt grab anything from the buffet, and looked like he was looking for something.

Around 5 minutes later he saw me and approached me. He asked me what my name was and if i was a student. I simply said my name and said yes on the student question. He then proceeded to ask me how old i was, and when he asked this i started to be suspicious of him, cause a guest has never asked me about my age like this (i‚Äôve been working at this place for almost 2 months or so). I answered his question about my age (20) to which he replied ‚Äúoh, so you‚Äôre very mature then‚Äù. And i remember responding ‚Äúuh yeah i guess i am‚Äù.

Then he asked me when i got off work, so i said that i got off at like 2pm. He then just said ‚Äúah come to my room after you‚Äôre done‚Äù. And i was thinking wtf??, so i just said ‚Äúsorry?‚Äù, to which he repeated the question and i was like ‚Äúnah i dont think so‚Äù, and he started asking me again if i am interested and i kept saying no, but he just didn‚Äôt seem to understand?? And it upset me a bit because he crossed my boundaries by far. 

He will be staying at this hotel for another 2 weeks and it just makes me not want to show up at work tbh. Is there anything i can do to avoid this man, or just being clear to him that i just want him to leave me alone? Anything helps :/

1mghw87,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mghw87/does_the_breville_precision_brewer_make_the_best/,Does the Breville Precision Brewer Make the Best Drip Coffee?,"Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 has been my go-to appliance for brewing coffee in the mornings, and I've put it through its paces over the past few weeks. This drip coffee machine caught my attention with its brushed stainless steel design, programmable features, and advanced brewing options that promise third-wave specialty coffee. Here's an honest take on how it performed for me and the people around me. 

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The brushed stainless steel finish on this coffee maker instantly elevates the vibe of my kitchen. Its modern look, combined with compact dimensions (12.72"" D x 6.69"" W x 15.75"" H), means it doesn‚Äôt eat up a lot of counter space. I‚Äôve had guests at my place comment on how great it looks, especially since it complements other appliances seamlessly. The buttons are user-friendly, and the display is easy to read, even when fumbling for caffeine early in the morning after a late night.

**Performance and Brewing Modes**  
This machine offers six unique brewing modes, including Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew. Testing these over time was fun. I loved using the ‚ÄúGold‚Äù mode on weekdays, which adjusts water temperature and brewing time according to SCA standards, ensuring I get my coffee at the ideal temperature (197 to 204 degrees). The ‚ÄúCold Brew‚Äù is a game-changer during summer days, as it produces smooth, flavorful coffee over an extended brewing time. My spouse, who prefers stronger coffee, swears by the ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù mode, and let me tell you, it delivers a robust cup without any bitterness. 

""Check [Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1](https://ngadgets.com/p/b078rqvqf1/) price on Amazon.""  

**Automatic Features and Customization Options**  
This coffee maker boasts precise digital temperature control (PID) and three different flow rates, so you can tweak it to your liking. I enjoyed experimenting with the ‚ÄúMy Brew‚Äù setting, adjusting bloom time, temperature, and flow rates to get coffee that matched my mood on any given day. The flow control improved the contact time between water and coffee grounds, making each brew more satisfying. One thing I appreciated was the Steep and Release valve, which adjusts brewing for small servings without needing the carafe, allowing you to customize a single cup of coffee. 

**Dual Filter Choices and Versatility**  
The inclusion of both flat-bottom and cone filter baskets was perfect. During gatherings, I used the larger flat-bottom filter to brew a full carafe, and for solo mornings, the cone basket provided a precise, smaller yield. For fans of pour-over coffee, it‚Äôs compatible with drippers like Hario V6. My best friend, who came over for an impromptu coffee tasting, was particularly impressed by how versatile this machine is. We even tested the pour-over adapter, and the results were just as clean and rich as manual brewing! 

**Positives**  
- Exceptionally versatile with six brewing modes.  
- SCA-certified Gold mode ensures quality coffee every time.  
- The programmable My Brew feature caters to personalized coffee preferences.  
- Includes reusable and eco-friendly filter options.  
- Designed with a sleek and minimal brushed stainless steel exterior.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Slightly loud when operating, which caught me off guard early in the morning.  
- The thermal carafe doesn‚Äôt keep coffee hot as long as I‚Äôd hoped, especially if you‚Äôre brewing for later.  
- Frequent cleaning required, particularly if you‚Äôre switching between brewing modes daily.  
- It‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve initially with all the features.

**Product Comparisons**  
When comparing this coffee maker to competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster, I noticed some distinctions. The Moccamaster delivers excellent simplicity and durability but lacks the customization that this machine offers. Another rival, the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System, provided a wider range of drink types but didn‚Äôt quite hit the precise temperature control or meet SCA standards. Considering the strengths, the Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 feels better suited for those who appreciate experimental brewing. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
With its advanced features, brewing versatility, and premium finish, this coffee maker feels like an investment in good coffee, though its price point skews slightly higher than some entry-level drip machines. However, the number of customizations and brewing modes justifies this for coffee enthusiasts. Those who often buy pre-brewed specialty coffee from cafes will find this machine a cost-effective alternative over time.
