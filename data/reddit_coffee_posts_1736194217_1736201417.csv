This development is extremely concerning, especially when compounded with the reports artist have made with regards to receiving extremely late payouts as of late.

I believe I can speak for almost everyone to say we are extremly sad to see such an amazing community lead stepping away or being let go from this program. MissS was the most active person we have ever had from Reddit's side in this program, and facilitated lots of great discussion.

Yes, the price is currently under 20 cents a share but don‚Äôt let that fool you. This stock once soared over $2, and with what I‚Äôm about to show you, it has every reason to fly high again. Part of the reason it fell is because of the massive amounts of cost associated with coming up with a new airplane helicopter.

**The Big Picture:**

Let‚Äôs start with their Q3 2024 update. The star of the show is the¬†**TriFan 600 -**¬†XTI is in the final stretch of its¬†**conceptual design review phase**‚Äîthe blueprint stage where dreams meet technical reality. By early 2025, they‚Äôll be moving into the¬†**preliminary design review phase**, which is where the magic starts to get real. Think of it like going from ‚Äúidea on a napkin‚Äù to ‚Äúactual blueprint in the hands of engineers.‚Äù

And XTI isn‚Äôt just sitting around waiting for regulators to catch up. They‚Äôve launched¬†**Flight Transition Simulator Version 1.9**, now equipped with OEI capabilities (basically - ""industry jargon for saying the plane is designed to handle emergencies with style. It‚Äôs like having an escape plan that‚Äôs so good, you almost want to use it just to show off (this post was sponsored by Boeing)

Boring money shit -

Big increase in Assets

|| || |22,418 Liabilities 2024|32,138 Liabilities 2023|

Decrease in Liabilities.

Average volume is about .04 cents worth of 87.5 million shares or $3.5million dollars worth for a very low marketcap company of 25million. Today was fucking 1.22 billion a 1294.29% increase since yesterday.

**Leadership That Inspires Confidence**

At the helm of this cutting-edge company (not aerotyne) is¬†**Scott Pomeroy**, a man with 35+ years of executive experience. This guy doesn‚Äôt just run businesses; he¬†*builds*¬†them. As the former CFO of Dex Media, Scott managed over $10 billion in equity and debt capital raises. That‚Äôs not just pocket change, it‚Äôs a sign he knows how to handle big money and big challenges. Oh, and he‚Äôs also the founder of Local Insight Media, because apparently leading one industry wasn‚Äôt enough for him.

**FAA Regulations - Boring government stuff**

Here‚Äôs a little industry secret: aviation is all about playing nice with the FAA. Luckily, the FAA just rolled out a new regulatory framework for powered-lift operations, which is like opening the door for XTI‚Äôs TriFan 600 to take off literally and figuratively. This is a game-changer, ensuring XTI isn‚Äôt just innovating in a vacuum but operating within a supportive regulatory environment. (Think what SpaceX lobbys constantly for)

**Why I think it might be good**

XTIA is trading at under 20 cents per share, which makes it a rare gem in the market. Let‚Äôs put this into perspective: if you skip your $6 morning coffee for a week and and instead something like XTI, you could own 200 shares. And if this stock climbs back to $2? You‚Äôre looking at 10x returns. My expectations are probably back to 40cents in the short term which will enable them to stop focusing on the stock and more so on the product. Remember a team that is willing to stick with around 4 cents definitely ain't leaving at 40. 

Sure, they‚Äôre not generating revenue yet, but here‚Äôs the thing: innovation in aerospace takes time. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day, and neither are futuristic planes. But with experienced leadership, a solid roadmap, and FAA support, XTI is setting itself up to be a major player in a multi-billion-dollar industry.

XTI Aerospace could be a decent long term company; it has an opportunity to make it in the future of travel, technology, and innovation. With the TriFan 600, they‚Äôre rewriting what‚Äôs possible in aviation.

The evening was already dark but somehow felt warm and pleasant. I could not understand what she was speaking. I have not learnt the language yet. Her voice was lower than usual. That was somehow beautiful. I was lying on her bed. The silence was still, floating in the air. I met her the first day of school. I danced with many that day. Danced with her too. Asked her name. Definitely forgot the day after. I remember the day she looked sad. This was long after the name day. I knew her by name, had danced with her many more times. Like always, putting myself into things that have nothing to do with me, I asked her, ""Everything okay?"" To be honest, I don't remember the exact question I asked that day. My empathic part felt right.

""Why can't I put myself out in this world like other people?"" Again, not the exact question‚Äîsomething of that sense. Me being me, I started to explain all the YouTube videos that I had seen that week and the ones before, explaining how social constructions work, how there is a community of Tetris players, how they had developed different techniques to kill screen the game, how millions of people celebrated a 13-year-old boy beating Tetris, how everyone is crazy in their own way, and that makes living beautiful‚Äîand how she too is beautiful in her own non-expressive ways. I remember I was feeling  an infatuation for her. It is so beautiful when people cry a bit, exposing what they are within, unaltered, unfiltered. How can one not get turned on by that? I meant that when saying she is beautiful. She smiled. Maybe she liked me. More than a friend.

She is braver than me. I would usually not talk about who I have a crush on. What if they get to know? It makes things fucking awkward. I would rather wait for my feelings to doze off eventually. She said she had a crush on me to someone. That someone said that to me. I waited for a week so it would not be weird, and a week after, I asked her, ""Well, do you want to maybe go out someday?"" Again, I don't remember what I asked. I can go through my old WhatsApp messages, but who cares‚Äîthis sounds better. She said, ""Yes."" Not that dramatic. You get the idea.

We went to a movie together. She had to book the tickets. I wanted to book the couple seat of the hall. My card did not work. Maybe she booked the couple seat. It was the same as usual. Maybe she did not. Bought popcorn, watched the movie‚Äîa little bit of laughter, a little bit of tears. Movie ended. Came out. Washroom break. Forgot my beanie cap. Went back, got the cap back, went out, found a park, sat someplace down, chat, chatter, nonsense, found a cafe‚Äîmilk coffee, cappuccino, cake, and a ‚Ç¨3 tip. Freezing Alster. Sitting next to each other. A side of me leaning on her and my palm in her hand. Few minutes of nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. And nothing further. We went back home. Was that a romantic date?

""She complements me,"" I said to someone who asked why her. Context‚Äîdance. We had to dance as a double. She did complement me. We almost won a dance battle once. The crew Pomatoes. Today was the third romantic date. The second one was more similar to the first one. I met her at her door; she took me to her favourite spot. We sat down, face facing each other, some words from my mouth. Leaned forward. My face would have been a few centimetres away from hers. Maybe I'm rushing things. *Snap*. We had pumpkin pasta today . She made it while I was wondering like a curious kid about the skulls and cool drink box hanging outside the window around in her kitchen. ""We can sketch,"" someone of us suggested. we were on her bed. I sketched a little; she sketched some more. My favourite album was playing. Then sketchbook on the table. Us, side by side on the bed. Little bit of chatting. Little more. Voices got softer. You could hear the tension in the space. Nothing. Nothing. My nose towards hers.

So, this is hard for me to say, because...I feel so guilty about it. But I need everyone's opinion about this because it will let me know if I should tell my husband or not. This post is long, and I hope someone will take some time out to read it, and give me their honest opinion.

So, I will give a little background to my life, because it will give everyone some context.

I come from a family of 10, that is extremely religious - almost to the point of being cult-like. I stayed with my folks until I was 25, and around that time, I hadn't finished school because my parents pulled me out at 12. Although I tried going back at 15, I was so behind and stressed out, that I dropped out at 16.

Anyway, I grew up hearing my father rant for hours about God's word. My dad would say basically that he was Christ reincarnated, that if we disobeyed him, God would kill us, and that we couldn't do anything in life without God's permission, aka my dad's permission. We were an extremely enmeshed family. I had no other connections to anyone outside the family. No aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, friends, teachers...I was taught that everyone outside my family - even in the church - were all deceived, and that it was my dad's mission to save the world with a message that God had gave him. I was told not to trust anyone, because devils and demons were always out to get us because we were special, and Satan would always try to attack us, to get to my dad. At 14, I became suspicious of everything I was being taught. And when I brought it up to my dad, he said that the devil was using me, and he seemed so betrayed, I tried to force myself into believing him again. So that's how I ended up staying with my family until I was 25. By that time, though, my dad's talks were becoming more and more strange. He would claim that the FBI/Illuminati, was watching us.. And at one point, he decided not to pay rent at the house we were living in, we ended up homeless and living day to day in a hotel. All of us crammed in one hotel room. Most of my brothers sleeping on the floor, me sharing a bed with my 2 autistic brothers. I would sell CDs with 2 of my siblings, and sing for donations to raise money for our hotel fare and food. Every now and then, my dad would just start ranting and raving about how I was an unbeliever and that I was holding everyone back. We had been living in a hotel for a year or so, and I just saw my life passing me by, and my dad would just talk and rant for hours on end, and we were forced to sit and listen. If we acted like we were tired of him, he would get mad. At the time I expressed I wanted to start doing things differently. I wanted us to get jobs and sell CDs, so that we could make more money, and get off the streets. My dad didn't want us to be too tired, and he was afraid that we'd start hanging out with people and we'd leave them. I tried to assure him that I wasn't going to do that, but he wasn't having it. But I was getting more and more frustrated at our situation. I watched a guy doing the same thing we were doing, selling CDs and hoodies while pushing a shopping cart. He elevated and at some point was selling his CDs and sweatshirts from a SUV. Doing things the way my dad wanted us to, was not working. For one thing, there were too many of us to support. But my dad wasn't having it. So, I dealt with going out for hours selling CDs. Sometimes days would be slow, and my dad would rant and say it was my fault because I wasn't being positive. There is more that I can say about my family, for example, my dad said I had a seducing spirit. And that he at one point ""felt that spirit on me"" but he had ""rejected it."" He said that when I was 12. My mom started looking at me in a weird way from then on, as if she thought I was trying sleep with my dad or something. Later, when I caught a few of my brothers peeking on me, and touching me in my sleep, I was blamed for it, because of this ""seducing spirit."" Again, there is more to say, but I will just stop there..

Anyway, at some point I met my husband while selling CDs. He actually bought one. He worked security at the local store there, and though he was supposed to kick us off the site for soliciting, he didn't. He would talk to us occasionally and I never worried about being kicked off the site while he was there. This went on for months. Then one day, he asked me out. I said yes. I told him of my situation, and he said he didn't judge. Since he worked overnights, I agreed to meet him in the morning for coffee. I told my folks that I was going out on that date. My dad kept me up all night, yelling at me, telling me not to go. I think I only had an hour or two of sleep, but I got up and got ready. My mom, stopped me one more time to tell me to not go. I told her that I needed to do something for myself, for once in my life. So I went and I had an amazing time. It was my first date ever. I was 25.

From then on, I knew I needed to do something. My siblings and I had been getting paid every Sunday to sing at a church. I asked the pastor to help me get my ID so I could get a job. And she did help me get my ID. I had to endure my parents yelling at me the night before the pastor came to pick me up to drive me to the DMV office. My parents didn't want me to get it. They wanted me to cancel. My brothers also didn't like the idea. I went anyway that morning. On a few hours of sleep. I got my ID. And then I applied for jobs.

By this time, I had kept selling CDs, and I kept building things with my boyfriend. He had given me a phone so I could keep in touch with him without using my parents' phone.

Yes guys, this was my real life at the time.

At some point, I decided to go over my boyfriend's house, and I gave my virginity to him. When I came back to my folks at the hotel, my dad said he ""knew"" the exact moment I lost my virginity.

Yes, guys, he said that.

He also said that he didn't feel comfortable with me staying there now that I wasn't a virgin. My whole family got on me, talking about what a horrible thing I had done. I was mentally drained. I tried to find any excuse to dump my boyfriend. So maybe it would fix things with my family. Because even though I cared about my boyfriend, he couldn't save me from my folks, especially while I was stuck there. So when I didn't like how he spoke to me over text one day, I dumped him. Later when I told my dad I dumped him, he said, ""Why did you dump him? Now you're hurting him for no reason."" Or something like that, I don't remember the exact words. But I knew then, I was wasting my time with my folks. I apologized to my boyfriend, and asked if we could try again. He agreed. I went over his house a few days later, and spent the night. My parents called my boyfriend and asked where I was, and when they found out I was with him, they told me to stay there. The next day, I went to get my things, and I moved in with my boyfriend.

Stay with me guys.

So, when I moved in with my boyfriend, things were difficult. I was hypersensitive, and I had no idea of how to build relationships and keep them. I was super clingy, and there was always something wrong. And I could sense that my boyfriend didn't want me as much as he used to. So about a month or so after we had got together, I asked him if he still wanted me, and he said he didn't, and that he'd rather we just stayed friends. He said after I had dumped him the first time, he just felt emotionally detached from then on.

So, my boyfriend didn't live alone. He lived in a 5 bedroom house with his cousins. A woman, with her daughter and son-in-law, and grandson. And that woman's brother and his 20-year-old son. So, 6 people besides my boyfriend and myself. I had nowhere to go but I had a job by that time, so I was able to pay rent. All the rooms were taken, so I had to stay with my ex-boyfriend, in his room. I had just lost my virginity, and sex was very new to me, and it was all I wanted to do. And the guy was (and is) good at it. Lots of stamina, good girth and length, all that. So, being stuck in a room with my ex, in his bed...I just couldn't keep my hands to myself. It's like I was obsessed with him. So, even though we weren't together, I had to have sex with him. He wouldn't kiss me anymore though, and everytime it was over, when he would get up and leave. No cuddling, would barely look at me. He would just say ""That was fun."" and then leave. And I would feel so empty inside. I was hurting real bad.

Occassionally, I would ask him why we couldn't try again. He would make it clear that he would always love me as a friend, but he didn't romantically want me. About a month later later he told me that I should try to see other people, so I could let him go. And he wasn't the only one who said that. His older cousin with the 20-year-old son had said that too. And so, I did. By this time, I had decided that I couldn't stay in his room with him, and so I moved out and slept in the living room on an air mattress, since all the rooms were still taken by that time.

And here is when my mistakes started.

When I went out in the streets, I went DEEP in the streets. My first time out, I went on 2 dates on the same day. And I made the poor decision of doing sexual acts with both of them. It went against everything I was taught about never having sex on the first date, and I felt like trash after that. And even though both guys had said they were clean, I could have gotten an STD. I didn't know exactly why I did that. I do know that I wanted sex, and I wanted to feel wanted, and I didn't want to be alone. Although I would have preferred to only have sex with my ex-boyfriend, I couldn't get that, and so...I took what I could get. But it wasn't enough. I still felt empty inside.

I had been avoiding my ex at the time, and would just go to work and come home. After 3 weeks he came to me and basically asked to be friends with benefits. I agreed. And from then on, we started having sex again. I cut off the one guy who I had been talking to and just dealt with my ex. Sometimes I would get mixed messages from him and it would feel like he definitely wanted me back, so I kept holding out hope for him. Some of his cousins (the lady who owned the house, and her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson) had moved out by that time, and I finally had my own room. I still only had the air mattress and it had a hole in it. I didn't have many clothes. Many times I asked myself, is this all life had to offer me? Being strung out on a man that didn't want me, and this holey air mattress? Even though it was better because at least I could have control over my life, what did that control get for me so far?

One day I was tired of my damn air mattress. It kept deflating, and it couldn't retain heat, so I was often cold. So I went to my ex's bed. It was a big, warm, California King. I could have texted him and told him that I needed to sleep there, but honestly, I thought I didn't need to. We had just had sex on it that morning. I thought he wouldn't care. But when he got home, he was mad to find me there. He kicked me out, and I remember being so angry. He had taken my virginity on that bed. I realized that he really didn't care. So over the next couple of months I stopped going around him as often. We'd still have sex sometimes - it was hard not to - but it was very rare.

And here comes my biggest mistake. It was my birthday week. I had just went through a bad situation at work, and I had quit my job. I had told my ex about the situation, and he didn't show he cared much. I was alone in my room, and my ex's 20-year-old cousin texted me. We were the only ones in the house. He asked to come up to my room. I told him he shouldn't. He came up anyway, and asked me to open the door. I did, but I told him we shouldn't. But we did. We had sex. It was short and unsatisfying, but we did. I made him wear a condom though.

A few days later, on my birthday, I was alone again. My ex, had bought me a pizza, kinda as an afterthought. Cause I asked for a present. And his older cousin with his girlfriend had bought me cupcakes. I was in my room eating them alone. I don't remember even getting a text from my folks that year. But I felt so lonely. My ex's cousin texted me again. And I went to his room, and I did it again.

I am not sure exactly why I did it. I think I wanted my ex so badly that anything remotely close to him was fine. Maybe I thought his cousin would be a good substitute. I think I was lonely. I think was angry at my ex too, for leaving me alone, so I wanted to get back at him, in any way possible, to show him that I was wanted. I think it was all those things. But I slept with his cousin twice. And I have regretted it ever since.

My ex had told me once how he felt about anyone sleeping with his cousins. But it was after I had already done it. So, I didn't tell him I did. Because I knew that if I had told him, he wouldn't want me.

But after that, I knew I couldn't stay in the house with him and his cousins anymore. So I left. I didn't really have anywhere to go, so I ended up at my ex's mom's house. After staying away for a month or so, he told me that he was getting back with his ex. So, I told him I was hurt, and I moved on. His cousin would still try to text me from time to time to get me to visit him, and I would turn him down.

There was another cousin who lived at my ex's mom's house. He liked me, and my mom-in-law had encouraged a relationship with him, but I turned him down, because I didn't want to make the same mistake again. He was a nice guy, and I could always talk to him better than my ex, but I still wanted my ex, so I couldn't do it,

But after about 2 months my ex came back to me to see if I wanted to get back in a relationship. I know that I probably should have told him at that time what had happened, but I didn't. I still loved him and I felt like I needed him in my life. So we ended up back together. I still lived in his mom's house at the time, because we were taking our time. But 6 months or so later, I moved back in with him. He was still living with his cousins. I just kept my distance. I began to really hate the cousin. I hated myself. I hated that he had even come on to me. I hated that I said yes. I just kept my distance and didn't talk to the guy.

A year later, my boyfriend proposed. I said yes. His cousin was there during the proposal. I got pregnant that same month, and we eloped that same year.

It's been 3 years, and it hasn't been an easy marriage. We have our 3-year-old son, we have our own place, and we are making it. We love each other and we always manage to make-up, but we argue a lot. I'm not saying the arguments are always my fault, but part of me feels like I am pushing him away, because I lied by omission and I don't feel like I deserve my marriage.

It's my birthday week, and I have just been feeling terrible. Now and then these past three years, I feel the urge to tell my husband what happened. But I know it will ruin everything. And I am almost certain he won't want me anymore. And if I tell him now, we have our son in the balance. We are a young family, and if I say something now, I will tear everything apart.

That being said, what should I do? I don't know what to do. This guilt is eating me alive, to the point of being suicidal. With everything that's gone on in my life, I am extremely damaged. Even today, I am still estranged from my family. They haven't even met my son. My husband had to practically force my mother to come see me when I was in labor. And the only people I have in my life now, are the people that my husband has brought into my life. If they find out what I did, because I know he will tell them all, they may turn on me too. And then I will have no one.

Since my husband and I got back together, I have been loyal to him. From the time we were dating again, till the time I got pregnant, to our wedding, to today, I have not stepped out of our relationship once. And I never wanted to. I wanted him to be my one and only. It's just that when we weren't together, I slept with his cousin. Many times I was able to talk myself down from telling him what I did, by saying to myself that what I did when we weren't together was none of his business. That it never would have happened if he hadn't told me to see other people. But that's not good enough for me now. I feel now, that I robbed him of his choice to pick me wholeheartedly as his wife. I can barely look him in the eye right now. My marriage feels like a lie. And even though his cousin now lives in another state, and we may not see him again (my hsband and his cousin were never close), I think this may come back to haunt me later.

And I feel like a failure at life. I thought about telling him in a letter, and then killing myself, because I couldn't face the rejection. I couldn't deal with another person hating me, and pushing me away. I can't deal with the love of my life feeling so betrayed by me. I know my son will be okay, because he will have a lot of people looking after him from his dad's side.

I just feel lost. I need someone to tell me...what to do. If I should tell him, how should I do it? What should I say? And if I shouldn't tell him, how can I live with myself?",1,1736200053.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

USA-WA,"Is there a way to do this even though my aunt Joan and uncle Joe live in the same household and are married? under the reason of negligence due to mental health issues?

My aunt Joan has undiagnosed, untreated mental health issues. She refuses to seek help, she does not believe she needs help. She does not speak English. We're of Asian descent. They will not divorce; I believe uncle feels responsible for everyone. Joan is religious/spiritual and any illness of the mind has to do with spirit, and not a doctor. She is open to medicine for physical things like broken bones. 

My uncle Joe is the sole provider with long hours, but in my eyes does little else in terms of household or parenting. *Family members also think he's a touch autistic, but he functions and has kept the same job for many years, works well with tech, and speaks english. I add this information to give background to their children's health/history.* 

My cousin Clare (16?) wants to see a professional in mental health, for ADHD and maybe autism. She's struggling at school performance and attendance. 

Her older brother, Cole (18+), we thought he had ADHD as a kid, but Joan disagreed and screening/treatment/medicine was never sought. He'd dropped out of high school, lives at home with them. I've heard secondhand that he apparently does not know right from wrong. We think Cole will eventually need to be homed in a facility for special needs but when exploring this option Joe heard that it takes the consent of both parents/guardians for placement, and Joan will not do this. 

They have a lot of issues, but we think they could benefit from Joan losing her vote to say no to Clare and Cole's medical decisions, by reason of neglect due to mental illness. 

Is there a way to do this even though Joan and Joe live in the same household and are married? 

Does Joe need to find a lawyer in ""Family Law"" ? What kind of titles or specialties are we looking for? At what department do we start? Are we approaching this the wrong way?

Thanks for reading

\------------- below is just extra info.

**Joan is the main ride for Clare to get to/from school and appointments. Joan doesn't believe her children need schooling.** *When approached with sending Cole to get his GED she had the delusion that he already has it, saying he'd earned it years ago as a kid.* Clare can convince Joan to take her to school, but struggles herself to get motivated to get out of bed sometimes to do so. Joan will not take the initiative to make sure Clare will go to school. I know she's 16, but 16 is also a kid; please bear in mind the kind of home she's grown up in. 

(Secondhand info) **Joan apparently does something funny to the food** she prepares and the kids don't want to eat it, they get by on instant/heat and eat foods. **She does the laundry funny, and does it sparingly**; she apparently tries to add excess water into the machine or pulls clothes out before they're dry and still sopping wet (both things that I know some people do with certain clothes and certain style washers, although maybe not the sopping wet part). The clothes stay wet and moldy in a corner. 

(things i've witnessed) Their house is a sty. The kids don't always have the best hygiene. Joe has allowed the children to adopt stray cats into their home because it's what Clare likes. They have missing or broken doors to rooms, they have mattresses on the ground. I've seen the wet piles of clothes on the ground. Their kitchen is a mess. They've had a few round of fleas at home. 

Joan sees bugs under her skin, she thinks the cure is to make her own soap from coffee grounds, and dumps it in the pipes clogging them. She is almost manic and fervent when it comes to how much peace she feels for Jesus. She has a lot of resentment towards Joe; her in-laws-experience was not the best when it came to Joe's family. I always suspected she was struggling from depression, post-partum or otherwise, with Joe's lack of support. But I heard secondhand that she had existing mental issues before their marriage that was hidden until after.",1,1736199865.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

Here are some of its top benefits:

1. Full of Antioxidants

Matcha is packed with antioxidants like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which can help prevent chronic diseases, promote overall health, and protect your body from free radicals.

2. Sustained Energy Boost

Unlike coffee, which often leads to crashes, Matcha provides a steady energy boost that lasts longer without the jitters. The natural caffeine in Matcha, combined with L-theanine, gives you a calm yet energized feeling.

3. Mental Clarity & Focus

Thanks to the L-theanine content, Matcha promotes focus and helps you maintain a calm, alert mind. It‚Äôs perfect for long work hours, studying, or any task that requires concentration.

4. Detoxification

Matcha is rich in chlorophyll, which helps detoxify the body by flushing out harmful toxins. It‚Äôs a great way to cleanse your system naturally.

5. Helps with Weight Loss

Studies show that Matcha can help boost metabolism and promote fat burning, making it a great addition to your weight loss or fitness journey.

Want to Try It?

If you‚Äôre ready to experience the amazing benefits of Green Matcha, I highly recommend trying this premium Green Matcha powder. It‚Äôs made from high-quality, ceremonial-grade Matcha that‚Äôs perfect for both beginners and Matcha enthusiasts. You can purchase it directly from Amazon through my affiliate link below:

* $24 to forward one checked bag, Kyoto to Tokyo
* $10 eSIM

Flights: about $1884 from YVR ($1377 USD)

* 110k Aeroplan pts (worth $1650 at 1.5 cpp) for business class nonstop flights on AC and ANA
    * Would have been 70k pts or $1050 equivalent for economy class, plus $129 fees
* $129 on airline fees
* $105 on seats.aero

Shopping: $569 ($415 USD)

* $283 clothing
* $101 skincare
* $99 gifts
* $87 snacks

Language:

* I didn‚Äôt use it enough, but for a future trip I‚Äôd listen to the entirety of Pimsleur audio. It‚Äôs really good for pronunciation and memorization of tourist phrases. I also had a list of ~50 phrases that served me well. Beyond that, I got by by pointing to menus and rarely using google translate for voice (I did use it a lot to translate pictures of signs and menus). I feel like I did the bare minimum, however other travelers I met knew even less which shocked me

Travel:

* Recommend seats.aero if you have Aeroplan points or Amex MR to spend. I had to pay for several months of it, but it got me the seats I wanted with minimal fuss
* Flew AC into Osaka, and ANA out of Haneda. Both were good experiences in business class, neither better than the other, just different
* It‚Äôs nice to save a shinkansen trip by starting/ending in different cities, but it‚Äôs not a big deal. No need to fly to/from Osaka if you‚Äôre willing to pay the $125 for the train and spend 4 hours
* Luggage forwarding was not worth it, I had to budget 2 days shipping time due to a holiday and it barely lightened my load at all (still had to carry 2 days worth of stuff with me, after all). Just book a shinkansen car with a dedicated luggage compartment. Ultimately it did arrive within 1 day
* Narita would have been fine, it wasn‚Äôt very fun taking my luggage to Haneda at rush hour on the subway. A comfy limo bus sounds nice, but the stops are limited, so I probably would have ended up on the subway anyway to reach the bus given my hotels location
* Can get/fund IC card entirely in my iPhone‚Äôs wallet app, I never had a physical card.  I just added money using Apple Pay $20 at a time so I didn‚Äôt end up leaving money on the card when I left. Very convenient. Doesn‚Äôt matter which brand IC card you pick, I chose Suica

Hotels: 

* You don‚Äôt have to stay in Shinjuku or Shibuya! I stayed a few days in Ikebukuro and it was fine, a more easy-going big-city experience, you‚Äôre still in bustling Tokyo after all
* Started in hostel seeking social experience, but it was 0% social. Was happy to switch to hotels for remainder of stay
* Namba Guesthouse Hive Hostel, Osaka: not at all social, pretty clean, not a bad experience. I booked one of the private alcoves for a little more space. Pretty depressing because I saw few other humans, even though the bunks were full at night. Not much cheaper than a hotel. Elevator straight from your floor to the train platform which is great
* Hotel Monday Kyoto Marutamachi: amazing hotel, great service, clean, and the room/washroom were same as a 3.5 star hotel in North America, great location too, very affordable for my dates ($61 CAD/night)
* Hotel Wing International Select Ikebukuro, Tokyo: very small, poor lighting, but otherwise clean and fine. Weird breakfast system, I would end up eating soup alone most mornings in the canteen. 5 min walk to train. Felt like an old but clean Best Western
* Galois Hotel Shin-Okubo, Tokyo: nice, clean, spacious room but small bathroom, < 5 min walk to train, affordable restaurant downstairs]

Money:

* Home Trust Visa for most of my purchases (no annual fee, no Fx fee)
* Wise for ATM cash withdrawals, easy to use and low fee
* If you‚Äôre signing up as a new customer, make sure you have enough time to receive the card in the mail
* I used cards when possible and spent $465 CAD in cash
* Used my remaining change on the last day to charge up my IC card for the trip to the airport

Practical stuff: 

* Consider Freedom mobile in Canada, they have lots of roaming plans though I used an eSIM which worked great for data only. Glad I didn‚Äôt use Bell‚Äôs roaming options
* I tried to save money by walking whenever the transit estimate was within 5 min of the walking estimate, but this was exhausting. It didn‚Äôt cost me any extra time, but it was a LOT of walking for me. Strike a balance. I did catch a lot of cool street scenes and vibes while walking, so do make sure you walk, especially in the back streets of Kyoto
* There really aren‚Äôt any easily accessible garbage cans when you‚Äôre out and about. You can find boxes to discard bottles though by vending machines
* Don‚Äôt rely too much on convenience stores for food. I caught the reddit hype about 7-11/Lawson/FM and the food was honestly pretty bad to me and I‚Äôm not picky. It‚Äôd be more like a novelty or emergency thing for me
* Every hotel has the same dryer and they‚Äôre cartoonishly slow. Do not be like me and try to dry a load of clothes at like 8 am before starting your day. I think I left the hotel at noon that day
* Airport customs guy didn't look at my tax-free purchases, seemed like a formality. Pretty quick, I had to go to some weird alcove at Haneda and knock on a random door

Attractions:

* Book Shibuya Sky sunset tickets 30 days (I think) out, right on the minute. They sell out fast, but you can get them if you do this. It‚Äôs very windy but worth it
* Umeda Sky in Osaka was cool too! I went there first. Totally worth the time. No booking required, but arrive well before sunset so you‚Äôre not standing in a line while it‚Äôs happening
* Teamlabs Borderless is a must do, it‚Äôs in a huge business district so give yourself enough time to arrive. Book well in advance for good time slot but it‚Äôs not cut-throat like Shibuya Sky at sunset
* Don‚Äôt schedule anything for right after these rooftops, have your schedule free. It takes surprisingly long to get back to the street from these areas

Nightlife: 

* Make any booking for 2 weeks after your last day in city X on hostelworld, pay the $30 or whatever, and use the chat. It opens 2 weeks before your booking and closes after it‚Äôs over. The entire city‚Äôs hostelworld users who have booked stays can chat and set up nights out/day trips/dinners, it‚Äôs immensely useful and the people were cool
* Airbnb experiences provide something similar, you can chat with other travelers and exchange numbers and see if they want to continue the night or hang out the next day (or meet up later on the trip if itineraries align). They run about $100 CAD, honestly the airbnb bar crawls were underwhelming but most of the value was in good vibes and connecting with other travelers.
* Everyone chats on Instagram, also see if someone will invite you to one of the Japan IG groups because some planning nights out also goes on there
* Kabukicho is a little sketchy but I was fine there. It‚Äôs mostly people trying to get you to go into their bar or massage parlor. It‚Äôs lively and fun
* Osaka had the best nightlife, I had a great time with my hostelworld friends

Food: 

* I went to a couple Michelin Star restaurants ($80 CAD for lunch at Lature, $130 CAD for dinner at L‚ÄôAtelier de Joel Robuchon Roppongi). Super worth it, would go to even more next time. Never experienced fine dining before, it was cool. 
* Ukiyo is not a Michelin Star restaurant but the experience was roughly on par. Service was more casual and friendly, and the food was better, but it was not super fancy. Still fancy enough to feel special. Highly recommended
* Booked Lature for lunch on my last day since I had a late flight. I‚Äôm going to do this on every future trip, it made my last day a pleasure instead of a slog. Highly recommend fancy places for lunch, like Lature and Ukiyo. The prices are a lot less than dinner and it put me in a good mood to enjoy my evening
* Tabelog was good for getting accurate restaurant ratings and for booking some. Some places are cheaper if you use the Japanese language version of the site, just use your browser's translate function. If it was a 3.5 star on Tabelog i knew it was good, and if it was 4 star I knew it would be the fanciest restaurant I'd ever visited 
* A high google maps rating is also reliable, it's just inflated. If it's got a 4.5 star on Google, it's probably pretty good, much like in Canada

Other things I recommend: 

* Feeding deer and having mochi in Nara
* Being in a huge group of people trying to get home before the trains close at midnight
* The food hall in the basement of a fancy department store e.g. Daimaru
* Juu-go soba restaurant in Kyoto
* Late night takoyaki
* Randomly walking around Kyoto back streets
* A yakitori restaurant off Omoide Yokocho alley in Tokyo (not in the main tight squeeze alley, but the businesses on the wider side off the alley). I think I was the only non-Japanese person in there, one of my most enjoyable experiences
* Bistro Nami in Kyoto, randomly walked in when some of the viral places in town were full, incredible experience and food, nice people who work there (I think a family?). I communicated with the son using google translate, he was curious and sweet
* Wife & Husband coffee shop
* Wagyu Steak Wakuni restaurant
* Oretachi-no Curry in Osaka. I didn't know it was dine-in only, it was my first night, it was exhilarating and spicy
* Gyukatsu Katsugyu in Pontocho alley, Kyoto. It basically feels like a tacky american restaurant chain, but it‚Äôs gyukatsu. I loved the food, I‚Äôm a big eater but it was too much for me
* Try a different food for lunch/dinner every day, try not to repeat. I think I had ramen and steak twice each, every other non-breakfast meal was something different, I loved it. So I tried 22 different things for lunch/dinner over 12 days? It wasn't really extra effort to do this, there are lots of options
* Do a little shopping at Uniqlo or Muji, or for products made by Japanese companies. It‚Äôll probably be a good bit cheaper than back home
* Bring back lots of unique snacks, I was enjoying random treats for months after I got back. Since I can‚Äôt read the packaging, every bag is a surprise
* Staying in separate hotels in Osaka/Kyoto, rather than trying to commute between them every day. It‚Äôs like an hour door to door if you‚Äôre taking the subway, it‚Äôs not as short as some redditors imply. I‚Äôd rather change hotels once than commute 

Things I do not recommend: 

* Hostel. Not social and not cheap enough to be worth it vs hotel
* Art Bar in Tokyo, felt very insular and hipstery in a bad way
* Okonomiyaki. I was so excited to try it and so disappointed by it. My biggest letdown
* Going to every shrine and temple. I am not very cultured and not sufficiently appreciative of things like museums and temples, so they didn‚Äôt impact me. If you're like me, just pick the few that seem the most beautiful or scenic or personally relevant
* Waking up super early to visit attractions. With so little sleep, I was dragging toward the end of my trip and didn‚Äôt have enough energy for some things. Maybe it would have been better to wait in a few lineups during the day so I could sleep more at night
* Cat cafe, only adult there, felt weird, cats were over it even though I tried to choose an ethical one per reddit
* Thrifting, it was really expensive and the stuff wasn‚Äôt that nice IMO. However I‚Äôm not one of the hot people who looks good in anything. If you are, it might be worth it
* McDonald‚Äôs. It‚Äôs fine, but you don‚Äôt have to go here like some people said. I actually liked it for breakfast cause I‚Äôm a big fatso and Japanese breakfasts are tiny, but you don‚Äôt need to plan to go here
* Staying 3 days in Osaka, 3 in Kyoto, and 6 in Tokyo. A better split might have been 2/4/6 or 1/5/6/ or 1/4/7. Osaka was fun to go out in, I think I stayed out til 5 am one night. But I didn‚Äôt need 3 days there, and there was too much to see in Kyoto in 3 days
* Staying within Tokyo for all 6 days. Do a day trip outside the city and see something cool or just ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Japanese life
* Desperately avoiding Golden Week. It's good to avoid it, but my concerns about overlapping it by a few days were overblown

Things I missed that would have been cool: 

* Sumo tournament (book the instant the tickets are released)
* Amusement parks (would have felt silly as a single guy, in retrospect I could have set up a group outing using Hostelworld chat)
* The cool hotel bar from Lost in Translation (under renovation)
* Teamlabs sites other than borderless
* Ryokan
* Himeji Castle area
* The river rafting thing near the Bamboo Forest in Kyoto
* Ueno Park
* Odaiba
* Seeing any part of Japan that‚Äôs not Osaka/Kyoto/Tokyo
* Mount Fuji. It would have been right after 3 days in Kyoto and I was pretty tired from all the walking, and I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood
* Going during cherry blossoms. I had the option, but decided on May so I wouldn‚Äôt feel so lonely watching couples frolicking among the cherry blossoms. In retrospect, it probably would have been fine

Overall, I‚Äôm glad I did a typical ‚Äútourist‚Äôs first trip to Japan.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried the ‚Äúlive like a local‚Äù thing which is stupid on a first trip to a new place, IMO. I wanted to see and do the things, and I had a great time doing it. Next time I‚Äôll see more of the country",2,1736199686.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Today I‚Äôll be praising PPP Store in Akasaka.
Work takes me to this area sometimes, and I‚Äôve now been enough times to be able to say that this place is a bit of a hidden gem.

The coffee: very good. The blend they use has a good balance between nutty, chocolatey, and just a hint of acidity. One of the few places I know of with flat white on the menu!

The food: toasted sandwiches, in-house made scones, brownies, etc. some are gluten-free. They also have ice cream for the warmer months.

The vibe: a massive, and I mean massive (half the shop front), front door leads you into a laidback space with concert posters of bands from the early 90s. A well-curated playlist seems to range from old reggae cuts to mellow modern indie. I‚Äôm not usually a fan of the latter, but often find myself Shazamming stuff.
For the warmer months, there‚Äôs also outdoor seating.

The staff: super friendly staff, but as there is only a small coffee machine, service can take a little while when they get a sudden influx of customers.",1,1736199665.0,FukuokaCoffeeShops,0,1.0,False

I clicked pretty well with the first girl who seems normal, good family, and through conversation I could infer her values which I find attractive and could definitely see working out in a long term relationship. I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs only 1 date but we‚Äôre both interested in a 2nd date so we‚Äôll see.

The second girl I had a first date like none I‚Äôve ever had before and none that I‚Äôve heard from other people. It was 11 hours‚Ä¶ it turned from coffee, to grabbing beers and playing cards, to listening to live music, and then grabbing dinner afterwards. We clicked like crazy and all social norms and questions were off the table. We discussed everything from the basic first date questions, to politics, religion, past relationships, trauma, favorite positions in bed, kinks, flirting with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what she said jokes‚Äù left and right, etc. Everything was off the table for us. It just didn‚Äôt end and we‚Äôre definitely seeing each other again.

The main concern I have is life style differences that aren‚Äôt conducive to a long term relationship. She‚Äôs an ER nurse who works overnight shifts which, I can absolutely see as being an issue long term. She‚Äôs also into astrology and looked at my ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and saw that we were basically compatible in pretty much all aspects. She‚Äôs also into crystals and i think horses too. I get that there‚Äôs a stigma behind girls who are into these things, but her intelligence was off the charts with the conversation we were having. Moreover, she was also in a throuple previously and is Bi herself. I‚Äôm a very non-judgmental person when it comes to lifestyle choices and if someone is self aware (which i picked up on with her), that‚Äôs all the more better. I just know long term, I want a family and i‚Äôm not sure how those values would translate into raising a family.

The bad news is that my experience with CPPS has absolutely wrecked my brain. I am definitely in a state of hypervigilance with regard to my urinary functions, and despite my best efforts, I find myself tracking my urination times (even if just in my head) and constantly checking my body to see if there's a new urge forming. I am well-aware that this type of mental state predisposes me to additional physical symptoms.

I'm stuck in a cycle where I have several great days and begin to relax, but then one day I'll urinate twice in two hours or something, and I'm back to being in a constant state of fear/awareness around urination. 

To be clear, I don't actually think those occasional occurrences are CPPS at all. I think they're just normal. I've talked to several people without CPPS and all of them report _sometimes_ peeing once per hour for a few hours, especially when drinking lots of coffee or water, etc. Nevertheless, I can't stop panicking and slipping into hyper-awareness every time I urinate more than once in a two hour time period. (To clarify, it doesn't happen that often, it's just that I panic when it does.)

How do I get out of this loop? To clarify, the treatment goal I have in my head isn't to have more than two hours between urination 100% of the time for the rest of my life.

I've left links to previous posts if you want context as to not make this post an eyesore to read.

To be broad and succinct, I've been trying for the better part of two months to move to St. Louis to be closer to friends and get out of a toxic living situation with my mother. I originally had a roommate to move in with at the beginning of November and became very good friends with, but then they mysteriously dropped off the face of the earth at the beginning of December.

Keeping in the spirit of moving forward, I decided to apply to the apartment complex we were looking at on December 20th. I figured that trying to find a roommate in such a short time was unrealistic, and that being physically in the location would be easier. I would've applied much earlier, but due to my car's alternator crapping out on me and a few other issues preventing me, I was only able to go down to tour the apartment three weeks later than I had planned. They said that the application would take 2-3 days to process, and as I am sitting here on January 6th, 2025, I still have no idea when I am able to get into the apartment, or if I will be able to at all. I asked multiple times if a Jan 5th move-in date was possible including before applying, as I wanted to make sure they had enough time to prepare the unit for me, and they said that should work. Feel free to check out my last post for more info on that.

I got and accepted a job offer at Kaldi's Coffee Roasting Co. at Demun Ave, in which I was to start Jan 6th at 8am following my move. I understand the weather would have made things difficult to move on Sunday the 5th, but there was no way of me knowing that a month ahead of time. Last night at 8pm, I received an email from my to-be employer that since it was no longer clear when or if I would be in town, that they were rescinding my job offer as they needed someone in the position immediately. This has been immensely heartbreaking, as I was so excited for this job, a feeling I've really not felt ever since working as an adult. When I visited the location after being offered the job, I ended up spending around an hour and half talking with the manager and two baristas that were there. I felt so comfortable, welcome, and accepted, a feeling that was the complete opposite of what I felt at my previous job.

So now, not only do I have no clue what's going on with my apartment, but I've now lost my job. I sit in a room that is 90% packed and in boxes with only the necessities available, with family and friends waiting to hear from me (my friends were going to come up to help me move, my dad and his wife were giving me a couch and were holding onto it since I don't currently have space) and I feel like I have nothing to show them. My saving's are slowly dwindling, as I've only had Instacart/Doordash to supplant my income since quitting my  job in November. Money, which by the way, was saved over the course of the last year and half to get a new/better car for myself by living with my mother. I was supposed to have moved in yesterday, and started my new job today.

This was supposed to be a new start for me, to get away from toxicity and surround myself with people who actually cared about me. I was going to use St. Louis's status of a larger city to find better mental healthcare, and maybe finally give myself a chance at working towards being happy.

Sorry for the sob story, woe-is-me bullshit. I just don't know how to feel or what to do. I'm just so incredibly pissed off, frustrated and stressed.

1hvagl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/copilotmoney/comments/1hvagl6/i_used_monarch_and_copilot_side_by_side_for_the/,I used Monarch and Copilot side by side for the past 5 days. Thinking If I should jump boat to Monarch.,"I‚Äôve seen the recent posts in this sub about Copilot's slow development pace in the past months, even missing their promise to implement the ""Goals"" feature by 2024. So I decided to take advantage of Monarch's 7-day trial + 50% discount for annual subscriptions and give it a test drive since my Copilot subscription ends next month.

Today is my fith day (after spending the first 2 setting everything up in the app), I'm still not sure if I should jump the boat. So I decided to make this post to organize my thoughts and maybe spark some discussion.

**Advantage Monarch**

Reporting features: Monarch‚Äôs reporting features are better than Copilots. The sankey chart breaking down the spending by category is just next-level (but I think is on the web version only). It annoys me that Copilot doesn't have anything better than that ""Month in review"" card once the month is closed. 

Month-to-date spend tracking: Monarch compares my MTD spending trends vs last month‚Äôs. I think this is better than Copilot's ""linear average"" because my spending is not linear. I have rent and bills due in the first week of the month. Monarch expects a higher spend that week and doesn't say I'm ""over"" an imaginary daily budget line.

Budgets & Goals Integration: this is the most important one. Monarch bundles income, expenses, savings, and goals all in one place. This allows for different budgeting philosophies (zero-budget, flex budget). I didn‚Äôt know how much I was missing ‚ÄúGoals‚Äù in Copilot until I realized how helpful ‚Äúvisualizing‚Äù my different saving goals can be. It gave me an extra motivation to actually stick to the budget.

**Advantage Copilot**

UX/UI: Not saying that Monarch doesn‚Äôt have a good design, but Copilot's is just... better. Copilot's refinement and intuitiveness are unmatched. It makes me want to check out the app even when I don't need to. If I stick to CoPilot, this will be the reason.

Approach to transition names: CoPilot allows you to change the transaction name to whatever I want. ‚ÄúJOECOFF947‚Äù can become ‚ÄúJoe Coffee‚Äù if it‚Äôs somewhere I go regularly, or simply ‚ÄúCoffee Shop‚Äù if I‚Äôm going for a more generic organization system. I specially like to change bank transaction names such as a transfer or credit card payment. I can also add notes that appear after the transaction name to give more detail to the transaction (e.g. Amazon: That thing I didn‚Äôt need). Monarch, however, decided that all transaction names should actually show the merchants‚Äô names, which may not work for everyone. Also, adding notes to the transaction in Monarch doesn‚Äôt append them next to the transaction name.

These are the differences I noticed the most when using both side by side for the past five days. Two more days to go before I have to make a decision.",7,1736199011.0,copilotmoney,2,1.0,False

Second time writing this, apparently including links in a post deletes all other text, so I'm writing this whole-ass thing again. Yay.

I will leave links in a comment to older posts if you want context as to not make this post an eyesore to read but to be broad and succinct, I've been trying for the better part of two months to move to St. Louis to be closer to friends and get out of a toxic living situation with my mother. I originally had a roommate to move in with at the beginning of November and became very good friends with, but then they mysteriously dropped off the face of the earth at the beginning of December.

Keeping in the spirit of moving forward, I decided to apply to the apartment complex we were looking at on December 20th. I figured that trying to find a roommate in such a short time was unrealistic, and that being physically in the location would be easier. I would've applied much earlier, but due to my car's alternator crapping out on me and a few other issues preventing me, I was only able to go down to tour the apartment three weeks later than I had planned. They said that the application would take 2-3 days to process, and as I am sitting here on January 6th, 2025, I still have no idea when I am able to get into the apartment, or if I will be able to at all. I asked multiple times if a Jan 5th move-in date was possible including before applying, as I wanted to make sure they had enough time to prepare the unit for me, and they said that should work.

When I visited the location after being offered the job, I ended up spending around an hour and half talking with the manager and two baristas that were there. I felt so comfortable, welcome, and accepted, a feeling that was the complete opposite of what I felt at my previous job.

So now, not only do I have no clue what's going on with my apartment, but I've now lost my job. I sit in a room that is 90% packed and in boxes with only the necessities available, with family and friends waiting to hear from me (my friends were going to come up to help me move, my dad and his wife were giving me a couch and were holding onto it since I don't currently have space) and I feel like I have nothing to show them.

1hvaeqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1hvaeqz/the_jury/,The jury,"John Chass said, ""so will it be‚Äù and then tightened the tie on his snow-white shirt. Suddenly, his body spasmed, and a figure in baggy clothing with a hood over its head ran out of his house.

¬†

Detective Roger Janus was finishing his cold coffee and twirling a toothpick in his hand, which in his mind was a cigarette. ""So no eyewitnesses?"" he asked. ""No, the wife and sons were visiting her parents, just this footage from the neighbor's yard camera,"" replied Constable Loggson . ""Okay, let's play this the classic way. What do we know about the family situation and personal enemies?"" asked the detective. ""Wife and two sons, friends say it was a close-knit family. Personal enemies are a bit more complicated,"" replied the Constable. John Chass - a pastor, city councilor and entrepreneur in the transportation industry could have had many enemies, and the small town in which he resided made it easy to reach them.

¬†

Richard Hadt ‚Äì a left-wing councilman was the main opponent of John Chass . During today's city council meeting, as its chairman, he proposed a prayer for the deceased. ""How dare a communist like you pretend to pray,"" hissed Ellen Genesis, a councilwoman for Chass's club, through her teeth . It took Hadt a moment to get over the unpleasant meeting, but when he approached his car afterward, he discovered that all the tires were cut flat. At that moment, Detective Janus accosted him, asking about their duels of fiery speeches. Hadt he admitted that it was so, they grew out of completely different ideological positions, but he wouldn't call Chass an enemy, they both worked for charity, sometimes together.

¬†

Next on Roger's list was Mark Boc, once the right-hand man of Chass's father (also a pastor) in the congregation. Boc seemed like the natural new leader, but it was Chass Jr.'s rousing speeches that captured most of the congregation, a split ensued, a new congregation was formed, and the old one never recovered numerically or financially. ""Mr. Boc , we're talking because I'm looking for people Chass might have been bothering,"" the detective said, accosting the pastor outside the church. ""Maybe once,"" Boc said , but the truth was that after years of success, Chass's flock wasn't doing so well either, and they were secretly talking about reuniting their churches. ""And would you have any witnesses to that?"" Janus probed. ""Unfortunately, no,"" the other replied, and they both nearly fell over from the shockwave as an explosion sounded from the church and flames shot up onto the roof.

¬†

Diana O. was next on the list, the pastor's affair with her had become an open secret in the entire town when he decided to break it off and return to his wife. Officially, they had no further contact, and the Chass couple worked to rebuild their relationship. ""Maybe it was her?"" Janus asked. ""Wounded love, murder of passion, the girl has a reputation in town, she could have hired someone."" ""You're too smart a guy to pretend to be a misogynistic troglodyte who judges guilt in a murder case based on how many partners someone had,"" Logsson replied .

Janus met O. when she parked her car, took her groceries out of the trunk and walked towards her house. ""Detective, I have nothing to say about Chass , it's past, it was a mistake..."" Suddenly they both stopped when they saw the words ""slut and murderess"" painted in red on her garage door.

¬†

Jacob Dinn was Chass's former partner in a transport company. Janus came across him when he was loading pizza boxes into his car. ""Did I resent him for throwing me out of the company we founded together? Of course. But the truth is that I was addicted to gambling, I was losing the company's money in casinos, putting it in danger. It was Chass who paid for my therapy and then got me a job at the pizzeria. He didn't hurt me, he saved me."" Suddenly, there was a crash of breaking glass, a bullet from a pistol pierced the window, flying right past Dinn. Janus shouted at the shooter to stop and give chase, unfortunately he was too far away to catch up with him, or even to catch his characteristic features.

¬†

Janus, nervous and sweaty, returned to the station, asked Loggson if the pathologist had determined anything yet. ""The case is not that obvious, he said to give him some more time."" Janus replied ""He's had so much time that the murder case in a quiet town has grown into destruction of private property, including arson and attempted murder."" "" The important thing is that the last name on the list to be questioned is Damian Lesow ,"" stated Loggson . "" Lesow , that lunatic? And what did the pastor ever have to do with him?"" asked Janus. Loggson replied ""It turns out that the pastor wasn't always such a saint, he was a football star at school and he and his friends chose the class nerd Lesow as a victim, sticking his head in the toilet and things like that.. you know how it is. And it had a big impact, Lesow dropped out of school, started avoiding people, lived with his parents, and after their death alone in a house that was falling into ruin, he allegedly takes drugs, avoids neighbors, neighbors heard him shout threats at Chass several times for ruining his life"".

¬†

Janus got in the car and started driving to Lesow's house , right in front of his house he received information that made him want to go back to the police station, but what he saw made him stay and pale with the phone to his ear he started pushing through the crowd. The head of the housewives' association approached him and happily started saying ""we caught the killer detectively, finally, after so many dead ends"", meanwhile Loggson on the phone ""we have the woman who ran out of Chass's house , she is an illegal immigrant, to whom the pastor promised to legalize her stay, not wanting anything in return. She claims that the pastor suddenly froze and then hit his head on the edge of the table; she ran away because she was afraid‚Ä¶‚Äù Janus‚Äô eyes went up to Lesow‚Äôs body hanging from a tree branch with the words ‚Äúmurderer‚Äù written on his T-shirt; meanwhile on the phone ‚Äúit would be consistent with the pathologist‚Äôs findings, the head injury camouflaged it, but Chass had a brain haemorrhage, he died of natural causes, there is no guilty party‚Äù. Pale Janus replied ‚Äúthere is no guilty party, but the jury has already passed verdicts‚Äù.

Its weight (14 kg) is a testament to its construction, contributing to stability during operation.  The dimensions (235 mm x 340 mm x 290 mm) should be considered before purchase to ensure it fits comfortably on your countertop.  The design is classic and uncluttered, prioritizing functionality over flashy aesthetics. The chrome-plated brass portafilter handle is a nice touch, adding both elegance and a comfortable grip during the espresso extraction process. While not visually striking, its timeless design will likely not clash with your kitchen decor.


## Performance: Pulling Shots and Steaming Milk

The Rancilio Silvia's performance centers around its consistent 15-bar pump pressure. This consistent pressure is crucial for achieving even extraction and unlocking the full potential of your coffee beans. However, achieving that perfect shot requires skill and practice.  The machine's lack of pre-infusion and adjustable temperature control means that mastering techniques like temperature surfing becomes necessary to dial in your shots perfectly. This isn't necessarily a drawback for experienced baristas, but it can be a steep learning curve for beginners.

**Pulling Shots:** The manual process of tamping and pulling shots on the Rancilio Silvia is part of its charm for many.  It allows for a level of control not found in many automated machines.  However, this control demands precision and understanding of espresso extraction.  Consistent tamping pressure and technique are crucial for consistent results.  The 58mm portafilter is a standard size, offering a wide selection of compatible portafilters and baskets for experimentation.

**Milk Steaming:** The Silvia's stainless steel steam wand is a powerful tool for milk texturing.  It produces ample steam, capable of creating microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.  However, mastering milk steaming on the Silvia, like pulling shots, requires practice and patience.  The steam wand‚Äôs power can be intimidating for beginners, requiring careful control to avoid scalding the milk.


## Ease of Use and Maintenance: A Learning Curve for Beginners

The Rancilio Silvia is not a plug-and-play machine.  Its manual operation and lack of automated features mean there's a significant learning curve involved.  Beginners may find themselves frustrated by the lack of pre-programmed settings and the need to manually control every aspect of the espresso-making process.  While this can be seen as a drawback, many experienced baristas appreciate the level of control it offers.

**Maintenance:**  Regular cleaning and descaling are essential to maintain the machine's performance and longevity.  While the process isn't overly complex, it does require a degree of diligence and understanding of the machine's components.  The removable water reservoir simplifies the filling and cleaning process, but the machine‚Äôs overall bulk makes regular cleaning a more effortful task compared to smaller, more compact machines.


## Rancilio Silvia Pros and Cons: A Balanced Perspective

Let's summarize the key advantages and disadvantages to help you make an informed decision:

**Pros:**

* **Exceptional Build Quality:**  The robust stainless steel construction ensures longevity and durability.
* **Consistent Performance:**  The 15-bar pump delivers consistent pressure for even extraction.
* **Powerful Steam Wand:**  Produces ample steam for excellent milk frothing.
* **58mm Portafilter:**  Offers compatibility with a wide range of accessories.
* **Classic Design:**  Its timeless aesthetic blends well with various kitchen styles.
* **Excellent Value for Money (long-term):**  The Rancilio Silvia is a significant investment but its longevity and consistent performance justifies the cost for dedicated home baristas.


**Cons:**

* **Steep Learning Curve:**  Requires significant time and effort to master its operation.
* **Lack of Automated Features:**  No pre-infusion, programmable settings, or automatic temperature control.
* **Requires Manual Temperature Surfing:**  Achieving optimal brewing temperature often requires manual adjustment.
* **Heavy and Bulky:**  Its size and weight can be a consideration for those with limited counter space.


## Rancilio Silvia vs. Other Home Espresso Machines: A Comparative Look

The Rancilio Silvia often gets compared to machines like the Breville Barista Express and the Gaggia Classic Pro.  While the Breville offers more automation and user-friendliness, the Silvia boasts superior build quality and potentially longer lifespan. The Gaggia Classic Pro sits somewhere in between, offering a balance of features and manual control. The choice depends heavily on your experience level and desired level of control.  If you prefer simplicity and automation, the Breville might be a better fit.  If you value durability, control, and are willing to invest the time in learning, the Rancilio Silvia is a strong contender.


## Conclusion: Is the Rancilio Silvia Worth It?

The Rancilio Silvia is not a machine for casual coffee drinkers.  It's a tool for those serious about crafting high-quality espresso at home.  Its robust build, consistent performance, and powerful steam wand are significant advantages. However, its manual operation and lack of automated features demand patience, practice, and a willingness to learn.  If you're prepared to invest the time and effort required to master its nuances, the Rancilio Silvia will reward you with years of exceptional espresso.  For beginners, however, a more user-friendly machine might be a better starting point.  Consider your skill level, budget, and desired level of control before making a decision.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:  Does the Rancilio Silvia come with a grinder?**

A: No, the Rancilio Silvia does not include a grinder. You will need to purchase a separate grinder for optimal espresso extraction.

**Q: How difficult is it to clean the Rancilio Silvia?**

A:  Cleaning the Rancilio Silvia requires some effort due to its size and the manual nature of many of the cleaning tasks. However, regular cleaning is essential for maintaining its performance and extending its lifespan.  Following the manufacturer's instructions is recommended.

**Q:  Is the Rancilio Silvia suitable for beginners?**

A:  While not impossible, the Rancilio Silvia is not ideal for complete beginners.  Its manual operation and lack of automated features require a significant learning curve.  A more user-friendly machine might be a better starting point for those new to espresso.

**Q:  What type of water should I use with the Rancilio Silvia?**

A:  It is recommended to use filtered water to avoid mineral buildup and maintain the machine's performance.  Hard water can lead to scaling and damage the machine over time.

A couple of month ago, I was looking into whitening kit products that actually work but don't cost a ton. Because I have a problem with my teeth because i'm a coffee drinker.

In the end, I found one that I think is pretty good for the price and gets the job done. So I thought I'd share it with you guys, in case anyone's looking for something to help with whitening. Also i'll give you some information down here! Hopefully what I've found can help you out a bit!

We wash her ears with cotton pad and surosolve every night and she takes an allergy tablet every morning but this ear thing is different from her previous. 

It's very dark and has stained all her skin. It comes out as dark but not like coffee grounds. It seems to look like mites but as I said we also have a 2nd and her ears are perfect.

I am M34, using my Garmin FR255 for almost 2 years now.

I don't run much, mostly do gym 3-4 times a week and I am around 180lb

I like my Garmin, but I hate every morning reading my morning report, telling me ""Poor sleep"" or ""Not enough REM"" or ""bad recovery""

Every. Single. Day.

My HRV \~30 most of the time, there was just one period when it increased to 45 with no reason and went down again.

My training status is always ""Maintaining""

Load Focus ""High Aer Shortage""

I just don't understand why Garmin wont adjust baseline, or its me having a really poor health?

if you can, please review graphs, maybe you have some suggestions what to try to improve metrics? maybe do more cardio, ride a bike swim, better food,

I think I eat pretty good food, drink 3-4 coffee a week, not much sugar. Just overall confusion

and yes, if you read every day in morning that you had a bad day, it affects you mood, at least mine

i was thinking do a hard reset and let it measure HRV from scratch in another 4w? not sure if it will do a trick

I'm I only one in this situation? any comments suggestion is appreciated

thank you!

Young people are frustrated and resentful because dating and love and becoming a parent is supposed to be easy, right? It's just one of those things that eventually happens, like buying a house. Their parents managed it, so did all their friends parents, and if they look down the street they'll see rows of houses owned by two people who managed to find love.

So why can't we?

On the flipside, you have our parents generation. They take it for granted. Yeah, house, just save up for a few years. Stop spending your money on starbucks and video games and you'll have enough, maybe get a part time job.

""Get a girlfriend? Yeah, I met your mom by hanging out with my friends at the college bar and making sure I didn't stink. It's not so hard, you're nearly thirty kid, get married already, maybe get a haircut or something.""

Little did your dad know that if he was born after 1990 that he would probably, like most of your other friends dads too, be single and frustrated and unable to find love. And your mom? Let's not even go there....

So TLDR.

""If you didn't spend so much on expensive coffee's you'd be able to buy a house."" Is the equivalent of ""shower, wear clothes that fit and put yourself out there if you want a girlfriend.

Our parents take what they have for granted and the younger generations feel entitled to what they feel should be easy to attain.

The answer is, like buying a house, it's something younger generations need to accept is much harder and way less people would achieve and the older generations need to appreciate just how much harder it is to attain and that they themselves would struggle immensely in todays dating landscape.",2,1736196790.0,PurplePillDebate,27,0.56,False

\- I train Brazilian jiu jitsu ¬±2 times per week in high intensity classes

\- family history is healthy with the grandparents having issues as they got into their 70's.

\- being mentally clear so i can focus 100% at work all day

\- keep up with my conditioning at BJJ, it seems if i miss a week my conditioning is shot whereas my coworker on the lion diet can miss a month and be 100% with his conditioning

\- maintain my general health and avoid any possible future risks

Step right up, folks, and welcome to the exciting world of Bitcoin ATMs in 2025! These high-tech marvels are no longer just a curiosity for the crypto crowd‚Äîthey‚Äôve become a mainstream sensation. But wait! There‚Äôs more. Pairing a Bitcoin ATM with our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** (check it out at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) is like adding nitro to your crypto engine. Let‚Äôs dive into how this dynamic duo is shaping the future of finance.

# Bitcoin ATMs: The Basics

First things first, what exactly is a Bitcoin ATM? Think of it as your friendly neighborhood cash machine, but instead of dispensing dollars, euros, or yen, it dishes out sweet, sweet Bitcoin. You can:

* Buy Bitcoin with cash or a card.
* Sell Bitcoin and withdraw fiat currency.
* Check your wallet balance.

No need for complex exchanges or lengthy sign-up processes. Just a few taps, a quick scan, and you‚Äôre good to go.

# Why Bitcoin ATMs Are Taking Over the World

Bitcoin ATMs aren‚Äôt just a fad; they‚Äôre a revolution. Here‚Äôs why they‚Äôre becoming the go-to solution for crypto enthusiasts:

# 1. Accessibility

Found in malls, airports, coffee shops, and even gas stations, Bitcoin ATMs are everywhere. No matter where you are, there‚Äôs likely one nearby.

# 2. Ease of Use

If you can use a regular ATM, you can use a Bitcoin ATM. The interface is intuitive and designed for all skill levels.

# 3. Instant Transactions

Why wait hours for a bank transfer? Bitcoin ATMs process transactions in minutes, giving you instant access to your funds.

# 4. Privacy

Unlike online exchanges, many Bitcoin ATMs require minimal personal information, making them ideal for those who value privacy.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the cherry on top of this crypto sundae: the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**. This handy tool is the ultimate sidekick for Bitcoin ATM users. Why? Because QR codes make crypto transactions faster, simpler, and more secure.

# What Is the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App?

Our app allows you to generate custom QR codes for:

* Receiving Bitcoin payments.
* Sharing your wallet address.
* Facilitating seamless transactions at Bitcoin ATMs.

# Key Features

1. **Quick and Easy**: Generate a QR code in seconds.
2. **Customizable**: Add colors, logos, and even custom messages.
3. **Compatible Everywhere**: Works with all Bitcoin wallets and ATMs.
4. **Secure**: Built with top-notch encryption to ensure accuracy.

# How It All Comes Together

Imagine this: You‚Äôre at a Bitcoin ATM, ready to buy some crypto. Here‚Äôs how the magic happens:

1. Open the Bitcoin QR Code Maker app.
2. Generate a QR code for your wallet address.
3. Scan the code at the ATM.
4. Insert cash or a card.
5. Confirm the transaction and watch the Bitcoin roll into your wallet.

Thanks to the app, there‚Äôs no need to fumble with long wallet addresses or risk typing errors. It‚Äôs as smooth as a perfectly brewed latte.

# Bitcoin ATMs: A Glimpse into the Future

As we look ahead, Bitcoin ATMs are only going to get better. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the horizon:

# 1. Global Expansion

More machines in more places, including rural areas and developing countries, bringing crypto to everyone.

# 2. Multi-Currency Support

Bitcoin ATMs will soon handle multiple cryptocurrencies, letting you switch between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more.

# 3. Advanced Features

Think facial recognition, AI-powered fraud detection, and voice-assisted transactions. The future is here, and it‚Äôs tech-tastic.

# 4. Eco-Friendly Designs

Solar-powered Bitcoin ATMs are becoming a reality, aligning with crypto‚Äôs push toward sustainability.

# Why the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App is Essential

Using a Bitcoin ATM without our app is like eating cereal without milk‚Äîit works, but it‚Äôs not nearly as enjoyable. Here‚Äôs why you need the app:

# Speed

QR codes eliminate the need to manually enter wallet addresses, saving you time and effort.

# Accuracy

No more typos or wrong addresses. QR codes ensure your funds go exactly where they‚Äôre supposed to.

# Convenience

Whether you‚Äôre paying for coffee, splitting a dinner bill, or topping up your wallet, the app makes it effortless.

# Real-Life Scenarios

Let‚Äôs put it all together with some real-life examples:

# Scenario 1: The Traveler

You‚Äôre in a foreign country and need some Bitcoin fast. You spot a Bitcoin ATM, generate a QR code with the app, and complete your transaction in minutes. Crisis averted.

# Scenario 2: The Coffee Lover

Your favorite coffee shop accepts Bitcoin. Use the app to generate a QR code for payment, scan it at the counter, and enjoy your cappuccino. Easy peasy.

# Scenario 3: The Entrepreneur

Hi everyone, I'm running a Chemex and Kingrinder K6 currently at 90ish clicks with 20g in 300g out. I simply cannot get any notes out of the coffee, simply the basic ""Coffee"" flavor. I feel like the extraction is correct, I found a spot somewhere between bitter and sour, but nothing I change seems to impact the notes. I tried going with a 1/17 ratio but to no avail. I do a 60g 1 minute bloom then 2 pours to 300g. Any suggestions? ",1,1736196557.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

So I've settled on getting pigeons and I've got my cage set up mostly done. Just need a brick or two for them and some toys. And I've already picked out what food and grit to be getting them, as well as picked out a new coffee maker and lightbulbs to ensure the home is teflon free. Our pots and pans have been replaced and we have an air purifier on the way. One thing really stands out though which is the toaster oven.

We have a toaster oven that my husband adores but which does have that inner non-stick coating on it to make it easier to clean. So we're trying to find a bird-safe alternative. The issue has been, well, finding one of these. We've found conflicting info on some on whether or not they have any non-stick and some of the ones we have found have been either very expensive or not terribly good. So I was wondering if anyone here knew of any toaster ovens that would be safe for a home with pigeons? If you do please share them!

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hv9e1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanceHedrick/comments/1hv9e1p/blind_shakers_are_like_magic_for_shot_consistency/,Blind shakers are like magic for shot consistency!,"Ever since I got my full setup, I've had such inconsistency with channeling and sprays (even when I thought I finally got really decent at WDT). At that point I had come to the conclusion that it was just going to be the case maybe with my setup/machine/etc... and I would have to live with it (unless maybe if I dialed-in my WDT so good that it would incredibly difficult to spend that same time and replicate it shot to shot).

Before I got my full setup, I was already aware of the existence of blind shakers, but I wasn't using one just yet as I was still waiting for a very specific brand blind shaker to come back in stock before I could order it; and I didn't want to settle for a lesser one as I knew that was going to ultimately be what I end up using in the end once I got it (it is basically the most expensive one but, in my opinion, the best one on the market that alleviates all the little workflow annoyances/accidents that folks mentioned having with other blind shakers - including the Weber one as well).

Anyways, continuing on my journey of experimenting and dialing-in shots while I waited (and continuing to have sprays and channeling, even with some decent tasting shots), it finally came into stock around mid-December and I had immediately ordered it and was looking forward to using it when it arrived (as an alternate/replacement for my WDT). But what came out as a result of using it I never would have imagined...

Now I knew (based on studies and evidences) that the shaker would certainly slightly improve extraction and ease puck distribution as well (compared to WDT). But after pulling like 20-30 or so shots with this thing since I got it, I am shocked to say...  

...I haven't had channeling or spraying in any of my shots even ONCE since I started using it properly (just after about the 3rd attempt or so)...

Like no joke...I actually still find it hard to believe. But I know I had changed absolutely nothing else about my setup, and have been trying several different coffees, baskets, doses, and grind sizes since then and, even the worst shot I pulled after getting the blind shaker (being a little quick/sloppy on the shaker for that shot too), absolutely NONE of them sprayed or channeled even close to as bad as they used to before (even with my best shot) when I used the WDT tool. And really, by the end when I had almost received my blind shaker, I had felt quite confident in my WDT ability by that point, so I felt any improvements in my technique further there is no way it would have made enough of a difference to make the channeling almost completely go away and consistently shot to shot as well.

That being said, I am sure I still may have been able to do more to improve my WDT tool technique. But what I can say for certain is, the amount of effort and practice required to get good at WDT appears to be SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the level of effort to get good at a blind shaker. And even if you do get good at WDT, it is a much much higher chance of inconsistency between shots (at least for risk of channeling and spraying) than it appears to be with blind shakers. In fact it's known that if you WDT really poorly you can even introduce more issues/channeling than if you hadn't done it at all.

Now to be clear, I definitely have not tried other more common/less-expensive blind shakers (as I had already determined for myself, based on earlier research, that blind-shaking would be the best for me in the end, so I might as well invest in the best one as long as the price is at least remotely acceptable). So I can't vouch for if other folks would notice the same kind of improvement on shot consistency and decreased/lack-of channeling/spraying with their setups and the blind shakers they would go with. But considering how much of a beginner I am, how much trouble I had with WDT, and how quickly I got good at using the blind shaker, I am more than certain that if anyone is having similar troubles with channeling or inconsistency between shots, it is definitely at least worth giving blind shakers a try to see if they will help you out (especially for beginners).

For reference, I am using the **SworksDesign Shaker Funnel** - https://sworksdesign.com/Shaker-Funnel-p657013013  
  
Some photos:  

https://i.imgur.com/XFdIvTQ.jpeg (the day it came in with my Bookoo scale as well)

https://i.imgur.com/bREx0g6.jpeg (inside showing the stem/plug and inner body)  
https://i.imgur.com/aKAIDk3.jpeg (under the lid)  

A couple of tips/comments I can make about this model in particular:

1. Compared to the folks that complained about lots of grounds retention issues on other blind shakers (including the Weber one), I 'm not doing anything special and I can say for certain that I don't to be having any significant noticable retention issues on this one at all (very very little if any and it's super easy to clean off too). Maybe considering it's a much different material than other shakers.  

2. Having the silicone seals in both the lid and plug are exactly as great as I had imagined them to be. Compared to other shakers that some folks complained about occasionally giving up on them because they often had accidents if they didn't hold the lid completely tight while shaking (or accidentally push the plug up), I can say for certain these silicone seals make ALL the difference and, if you ensure they are seated all the way before shaking, it is very difficult to have an accident where grinds fall out while shaking. The little bit of extra effort to install/remove the lid is absolutely worth this piece of mind in my opinion.  

3. I found that shaking it for 10 seconds horizontally (side-to-side), rather than vertically or tumbling it all around, produces slightly better tasting shots (in my opinion at least), and it even more so decreases grounds retention (making it super minimal at that point). Here is a video referencing where I got this idea from and deciding to test it for myself on my blind shaker as well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73uQ1vSdUZg  

4. In my case I don't use any of the fines filters that it comes with but it's still nice to have to experiment with in the future.  

5. Releasing the grounds from a very small height (about 1-2 inches) leaving a gap between the bottom of the shaker and top of the portafilter is important to allow them to fall and funnel into the portafilter properly for more even distribution (this was confirmed by Lance as well).  

Now to be 100% clear, I am not AT ALL telling folks to go out and get a blind shaker and replace everything you're already doing for puck prep. Not at all. But I do hope all this information and sharing my own experience might at least be helpful to some to make their own decisions. If anyone has any more questions for me about how I shake, this model blind shaker in particular, or the rest of my setup, please don't hesistate to ask and I'll be happy to answer. Please feel free to share your experiences as well. It will be interesting to see if anyone else had similar improvements in their experience.

**TLDR**: Blind-shaking alleviated almost all of my shot inconsistencies and channeling issues compared to when I just used WDT. This is coming from someone who is a beginner but had already got well accustomed to their setup and done tons of research on all the fundementals of espresso-making and what benefits their tools can provide to get to where they are now.

Is there some kind of etiquette I'm not aware of? When I'm with my partner I have noticed „ÄéThe Look„Äè from others, like they're annoyed by us? We're not yelling, but maybe our standard for that is different? Idk, if you know please inform me.

Generally, I think everyone is exhausted and having a lot of complicated feelings. I struggle with agoraphobia especially bad when I'm in a new area, because I just don't want to make anyone feel any type of way, you know? 

Thanks for reading. I hope this lands the way I intend! If you're considering the response ""just Google it"" please know I've tried and I very specifically need a human to answer me plus any follow up questions. I unfortunately don't make the rules for my brain injury. If I did I'd be much happier and easier to get along with, promise.",8,1736196252.0,asheville,18,0.75,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

The time has come for us to awaken. Not from our tired state, but from any ideas that someone else is going to build this for us. 

**$SHIBUSSY as a project needs to be a community driven cult.**  

We are the tired, we are worn-down, we are terminally exhausted‚Ä¶ but we are also the ones who see through all the bullshit. This is YOUR movement, and the only way we blow this up is by owning it, sharing it, and spreading the tired gospel far and wide.  

This community has already done amazing things, but we‚Äôre just getting started. Every meme you make, every post you shill, every new Sleepyhead you bring in. It all adds to the fire. And let‚Äôs be real, the crypto world is watching, looking for the next thing to obsess over. There's ZERO reason it can't be shibussy. 

We‚Äôre not here for a pump and dump, we‚Äôre here to create a movement that‚Äôs too tired to quit. A community of degens standing on tired ground, proving that when enough people believe in something, there‚Äôs no denying it.

**Some ideas on how anyone can get involved:**

- **Raid Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram** with memes, shills, and tired truths. 

- **Invite your friends** bring them into the fold and show them what it means to be terminally tired. Make no promises. This should be fun at best and anything else that comes from it is icing on the cake. Be honest about the space and the realities of losing.

- **Share your ideas!** Whether it‚Äôs memes, videos, or shill strategies, this cult is powered by you. The community is the collective leader of this project. I‚Äôll push the buttons and try to keep it on course, but this is truly your project.

- **MAKE SHIT!** Make anything. This is your IP. Make anything you want. Make a video game. Make a cartoon. Make stickers. Make shirts. Make memes. Make your own coffee brand. Make a shibussy themed rug sniffing ai agent. Even if you don‚Äôt consider yourself a creative person, I‚Äôm telling you right now, YOU ARE. We are all creative beings and sometimes all we need is the spark of a SHIBUSSY to enable us to think creatively and have fun.  We have set the tone for story and endless creativity, and now the community needs to continue to build on what that can become. Fire in any/all directions.

This is bigger than a coin. This is about creating something real, something absurdly honest in a space filled with scams and lies. Together, we can show the world that tired isn‚Äôt weak, it‚Äôs relentless.

Remember it's early days on BASE and there will be a lot more people being onboarded. That's a lot more people who could get fucked by the bad guys. Hopefully we're here for them to be the first thing they find. If not... we can hope that they stick around and find this project so we can build them up.

So go out there and spread the word. Reach the sleepwalkers who don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre sleepyheads yet. Let them see what we‚Äôre building, and let‚Äôs grow this cult into something that crypto has never seen before.  

Stay tired, stand on tired ground, and remember‚Ä¶ every meme, every post, every nap matters. This is our moment. Let‚Äôs take it.

The pattern is usually the following: I meet a nice girl that I have something in common with. We chat and have a good time to the point where I invite her to get a cup of coffee or the like. If she says yes, we have a nice time. I like her so I ask her out again, perhaps to get lunch, or a drink, at which point it either becomes platonic, or it becomes obvious to her I like her, and get turned down.

Now, I'm open minded. Not everyone clicks with everyone. But nobody, ever? I feel like everyone has had experiences which were great, or sucky, or anything in between. But at least they had them...

I've been told I'm not unattractive and/or cute, but also that I'm outgoing, and funny. And it's not like I don't put myself out there - I've tried with people I've been matched with by friend, I've tried apps, Facebook groups, parties, college classmates... you name it!

What I'm most scared of though, is thinking about the matter and blaming others. I don't want to be that guy and I'm not. But the thing is, I don't blame myself, I don't blame the people I'm interested in, and I can't wrap my head around the fact that *it's just poor timing* or *I just didn't meet the right person*... nobody meets the right person straight away, do they?

1hv98du,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1hv98du/advice_for_a_partner_trigger_warning_perhaps/,Advice for a partner (trigger warning perhaps?),"So I‚Äôm sorry if I upset or say anything incorrectly, I am a person that has a long term girlfriend of 14 years and she suddenly discarded me after taking a new job. 

She has experienced a very traumatic lead up to this over a year and a bit where she had a large outbreak of eczema on her face that really traumatised her confidence. She cried everyday getting ready for work and I supported her deeply. She came out of the outbreak after about 10 months and then after a month she fell pregnant. As we waited for a scan, she had a miscarriage. To add to this her boss was pregnant and everyday became a nightmare for her. She would lift just at the sight of me bringing her a coffee to work.

So we get her to quit her job and we go on holiday, it‚Äôs wonderful we make plans as I had recently got a new job and we have a teenage daughter now and planned to move house. It was like a good checkpoint in life where things were really looking positive. 

So she starts a new job, same old her for about four days where she then starts to mention they drink a lot and go out a lot after work. She makes a new friend at work and she had struggled for any friends, I was her only real support network and she really relied on me a lot. 

So this woman happens to be a lesbian, I found out she confessed her feeling for my girlfriend and it would seem to me my girlfriend has made her the new favourite person in her life. She seemed to have morphed into a new version of herself and she now says she‚Äôs a lesbian to me and has been suppressing it. She completely changed her regard for our daughter and became completely emotionally destructed from our family life. She just disappeared at times and completely devalued me. 

My reason for coming in here is to try and find some sense in my pain from people that also suffer this awful illness.

I have seen so many signs she‚Äôs unwell. I‚Äôve tried to frantically tell and show all I can and I know it‚Äôs never going to work. I just have begged her to go to the doctors and talk to someone before suddenly changing everything she has built. 

When I created emotional distance, she came home and cried and said she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs very well, we kissed, it felt like I had just had this eureka moment after months of hell but she just sort of went back into her old self the next day like nothing happened. Didn‚Äôt call the doctors as promised and continued to push on.

She will call me like nothings happened at work, be in the house with me when she is about, happy to sleep in the same bed, but just emotionally detached and completely thrown away what was a really deeply connected relationship since children. 

She has discarded a best friend in the past for no reason and I just never thought much of it at the time because I didn‚Äôt actually know much about BPD.

She seems stuck in not wanting to leave the comfort of the home and still uses me for things and I‚Äôm completely emotionally attached and unable to find the right strength for a consistent amount of time to create fairness.

Hi! Looking for advice on how to deal with this situation... 

I '28 F' moved to a new area with my hubby and kids a few years ago. Knew noone in the area.

I felt that I finally made a connection with a mum '33 F' that lives down the road. We started hanging out a lot, with our kids and hubbies. Texting daily and checking in. It was really nice.

She had said at the time that she had felt really hurt by someone she considered to be close. That she felt ditched by this other mum for a new group. 

Anyway, a year down the line and this mum friend of mine makes up with her old bestie and they begin hanging out again constantly. That's fine. But she stops saying yes to any of my invitations to hang out or for playdates. Also fine, I get it. It hurt but I also get that she probably has more in common with this other friend.

However, what I don't get is she still texts me constantly. Checking in to see what I'm doing, updating me on her life and all the fun things she's doing whilst wanting to know what I've been up to. Even sending me tiktoks daily and messaging me random stuff. Now that just feels like mental torture. I feel like she let's me down and then pulls me back in. I don't get it... everytime I feel like she's really chatting with me and initiating convo after convo I invite for a coffee and it's a no. Then a few days later she's spending time with the bestie. She never suggests meeting up anymore so why text me constantly? 

I also just need help knowing how to navigate this? Our kids are friends at school so I want to delicately pull away but don't know how to without being rude and just not texting back? 

So in terms of questions -

Why is she still checking in constantly if she doesn't want to ever actually see me?
How do I distance myself without being rude?

Thanks in advance xxx

Our interest is caffeine content. We want a full serving of caffeine, but also trying to find the right mix of ingredients to make our iced coffees taste good (my wife has a bit of a sweet tooth). We started by using the strong/shot settings. Then we felt that maybe we were wasting a pod by going that route and we needed a little more coffee....so went to the strong/6 oz. setting.

Is the caffeine content the same, regardless of setting? Meaning...is the caffeine truly more concentrated at these lower volume amounts?

For some context, me (24F) and bf (23M) have been together for a little over 3 years now. I have had this concern in the back of my mind for a little bit now but have always brushed it off and told myself i‚Äôm being too picky, too hard on him etc.
I am by no means a materialistic person, i don‚Äôt really ask for much seeing that i tend to be a very independent person in general‚Ä¶
now, some examples. i notice very very minimal effort from him, he always makes a point to tell me he loves me, asking me how i am and being communicative but it almost doesn‚Äôt mean as much without the actions, i do know he loves me and we talk about marriage and our future plans and i never question that aspect but it‚Äôs the little things in his actions that make me feel like he lost any effort towards showing it, i also see other relationships around me (and i know i should not compare everyone‚Äôs different) where bf does everything and more for her, without batting an eye. 
I have received flowers maybe 5/6 times in the span of 3 years, 2 of those times being valentine‚Äôs day, 1 being my birthday and 2 other times after an argument, and if i have brought it up to him, or the fact that id appreciate my favorite drink or snack being dropped off or him showing up w it before picking me up, he‚Äôll say ‚Äúwhat do you mean i always get you flowers/coffee??‚Äù what do YOU mean always? or he‚Äôll say ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt know you were materialistic like that.‚Äù is that me being materialistic?
He RARELY comes out to help me bring my bags or things inside when i get to his house, or when dropping me off home and i have things to carry he‚Äôll say ‚Äúgot it all?‚Äù instead of making the extra effort to get out and help me inside, and after that i‚Äôd rather just do it myself instead. we rarely spend time at my house (we don‚Äôt live together yet, can‚Äôt afford it in our area unfortunately yet) but he consistently makes a point to tell me he wants to be home, he‚Äôs tired, needs to see his family, or has some reasoning‚Ä¶. The other day i had asked him to run to the store for me and bring me something i needed because im sick and didnt really want to go out in the cold after showering and getting in bed, which he did and im grateful for but he texted me ‚Äúcan you come out to get it‚Äù and i said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt come inside?‚Äù he then came inside, pretended to throw it and said ‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt have come to the door? i need to go home and go to bed, i have work early.‚Äù i didn‚Äôt really appreciate that‚Ä¶
besides that, if i ask to stop for a coffee or something small, he‚Äôll make a comment ‚Äúugh seriously? i don‚Äôt have that kind of money?‚Äù or ‚Äúsend me the money for it‚Äù or something along those lines‚Ä¶despite making more money than me and having way less expenses than i do‚Ä¶
he always says how we need to go to a nice dinner, he knows some nice restaurants but he‚Äôs never planned it? we don‚Äôt often go out to eat but when we do he‚Äôs made comments a few times about how ‚Äúhe always pays‚Äù and ‚Äúhe would really appreciate if i would pick up the check sometimes, i work too and can pay sometimes.‚Äù 
i don‚Äôt know, maybe im expecting too much? maybe im being too nitpicky? i‚Äôd love to hear some advice about it and, i have talked to him about it before, he either understands and says he‚Äôll do more, but then a few weeks/months later it‚Äôs right back to the beginning or he questions ‚Äúwhere this is coming from‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy i‚Äôm being so materialistic‚Äù

1hv8lsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hv8lsu/siblings_and_the_liquor_store/,Siblings and the Liquor Store,"A while back, my wife and I were walking into a State Liquor store after a Friday Night Date Night. As we were walking from our car to the store, out of the store is walking a dude who kinda looks like a (I thought TBM?) brother of mine. He had the same build, the same gait, the same size, and even a similar complexion (at least as well as I could tell from 20-ish feet away) as my brother. But it wasn't my brother. So I continued on. 

My wife also noticed all of this. She said out loud, ""Oh! I thought that was \*brothers name.\*""

""Yeah, He does look a lot like him."" I replied. 

We continued for a few more steps until we were almost to the store entrance and my wife asked me with a chuckle, ""What would you do if that actually WAS your brother?"" She asked in a tone that I interpreted as ""What if we got caught?""

I slowed down, and didn't reply right away. I thought hard about it. What if I wasn't the only one in my immediate family who was out of Corp? So I replied, ""Honestly, I would love nothing more than to sit down, and have a Drink with any of my Siblings.""

That surprised her. It surprised me too. I've been thinking about this experience since it happened. The Corp pretends it stands for protecting families. TSCC would respond to a post like this as if I was the one who separated myself from them by walking into a liquor store on a Friday night, as if they had no accountability.  They do have one thing right though, healthy Family Relationships are the Most Important. But they don't realize that it is the Corp that is actually the one putting on the pressure to break them apart.

To any PIMOs or ProgMos who have siblings/relatives you know who are more formally/publicly out of the Cult, call them up. Invite them over. Let them ""teach"" you how to drink / order a coffee. Ask them ""Why,"" and listen. Family still matters to us. It is tricky trying to guess and navigate who I can be authentic around and who I can't.
