1k2zswi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1k2zswi/large_intestine_stricture/,Large intestine stricture,"Hello,

I hope you all and your kitties are doing well.
 
I just wondered if someone had a similar situation and could help us. My little baby (1.5 years old) got sick two days ago - he vomited his food. At first I didn't think much of it, because it happened before. I noticed that he was sad and not really into games like he is used to. Later he vomited once again with white foam. Soon he started to hide under a coffee table which is very unusual to him. 

Since it was late evening I called to the vet that was still open and we went there. They did an Xray but couldn't see anything bad except for trapped gas. They gave my kitty some medicine and barium (as a contrast for another Xray) and let us go home. 

The next day he seemed a little bit better and we went in again - they repeated an Xray - found a stricture into his large intestines. They also did his bloodwork and echoscopy - bloodwork came out okay, except for showing dehydration and they couldn't find anything that could've blocked the intestines. We got some more medicine and an IV. Got home. In the evening we went in again (Yes, the third time - vet told us to do that). They repeated an Xray - contrast substance was moving slowly as the stricture itself. They asked us to come in the morning. When we got home my little baby didn't drank or ate (except liquid snacks - it was allowed by our vet) so I gave him water using a syringe (which was also allowed). 

The next morning during our fourth visit they wanted to keep an eye on him so asked us to leave him there - which we did. It was suppose to be until the evening but we got a call earlier to come and pick him up since he was extremely stressed - despite this, they still gave him medicine and an IV. They mentioned that he didn't vomit (the last time vomiting was before the first emergency visit). My kitty even pooped and peed at night. I thought he was getting better but he still refuses food or water - again, except for the liquid snacks. He went to his water bowl and drank himself once after the last visit. Vet told us if he still doesn't eat or drink normally they will perform operation on the next visit which is tomorrow morning.
 
I don't know if I am overreacting or not, but is it okay to wait for that long? My heart aches to see him that way - he rests a lot and tries to be nearby without hiding. What should I do? ",1,1745079049.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I (late 20s, M) had a falling out with a guy I met through my school library. Let‚Äôs call him¬†*Charles*. We started hanging out a lot, and I ended up opening up to him about some pretty personal stuff: childhood bullying, family issues, and even some past mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. I thought he was a good listener and trusted him. Eventually, he brought me to his church, and I got along with some of the people there.

Over time, I started noticing some behaviors I wasn‚Äôt okay with. He and his brother would talk about politics, especially supporting Donald Trump, and tried to convince me to change my views. I told him I wasn‚Äôt a supporter and didn‚Äôt want to talk about politics. But he pushed, asking how much of my political views were influenced by my dad (who‚Äôs a Democrat). When I refused to answer, it led to a really awkward conversation where he kept pushing me to quantify my beliefs, and I felt boxed in.

Eventually, I told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate his approach and asked for an apology. He refused to apologize over text and insisted we meet in person. When we did meet, I bought him a coffee, but instead of an apology, he belittled me. He told me I had low self-esteem and was trying to bring him down to my level. He even said I was speaking like ""the devil"" and insisted on praying with me, which I declined. I felt completely disrespected and walked away from the friendship.

Since then, I‚Äôve distanced myself from the church group and him. I‚Äôve also been avoiding his friends and anyone connected to him, but recently, I‚Äôve been feeling anxious because his brother deleted me off LinkedIn, and Charles has been giving me a fist bump whenever he sees me, as if nothing happened.

Now, I‚Äôm worried he might be spreading personal details about me ‚Äî like my mental health struggles ‚Äî to make me look bad, and it‚Äôs really making me feel uncomfortable. I haven‚Äôt responded to his friends who‚Äôve reached out, and I‚Äôve kept things vague about being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù with work and school. But it‚Äôs starting to feel like I‚Äôm just letting him control the narrative.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to handle this situation moving forward. Should I address it with his friends, or just let it go and keep focusing on my own life? How do I deal with the fact that I might be portrayed unfairly by him or his circle? I‚Äôm trying to protect my peace but also feel like I need to put my foot down somehow.

Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1,1745079003.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I know there is a correlation to substance abuse because I had a 7 year remission period without any meds, until I started regularly abusing weed & coffee again with some micro dosing of shrooms because I believed it would help rebuild my neural circuits (I use Lion‚Äôs Mane now since it is not a hallucinogen) and ended up having two very close to each other (2022, 2025). My first one where I got diagnosed was in 2014 (the gap in between was a long remission period where I was only on meds upon leaving the hospital for a little less than 2 years because I was determined to find an alternative option after experiencing tremors that I still have till this day that never went away and have traumatized me from relying soley on meds; especially antipsychotics. Although, after three episodes, I still have to wonder what is best for me and if I can really do this without an added low dose antipsychotic as I plan to stay on at least Lamictal 200-300mg & begin implementing a plant based keto diet with consistent exercise & routine. I may never have kids because I haven‚Äôt found my life partner so I can mainly focus on myself. Although, it makes me sad. I‚Äôve been able to get plenty of rest after each episode and I highly correlate the 12 hours a day of sleep for three months with the ability to take off from work a life saver thanks to my parents being understanding in this respect. Although there are several things we disagree on when it comes to the meds and it is getting depressing to be co-dependent of them. I pray O never have to get on disability, although I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs not the worst alternative as you can still work. My goal is never to be hospitalized again though; specifically for psychosis or get on trouble with the law from my condition. Basically, I never want to have a relapse that is fully out of my control and that I can manage with emergency meds like Seroquel at home if needed. So, I would basically like to only rely on monotherapy with a holistic lifestyle.  

I‚Äôd like to know the following:

1. How many episodes have you had? 

2. What is your diagnosis? 

3. Did you episode include psychosis? 

4. Are you on meds? If so can you specify which ones and dosages please? 

5. How long have your remission periods been in between? 

6. Do you believe you‚Äôll have another one if you continue doing what is keeping you stable? 

7. Can you please share what has allowed you to remain stable by sharing your background & any tips that have helped you beat this label? 

Looking forward to hearing everyone‚Äôs journey.",1,1745078956.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False

1k2zqd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k2zqd5/my_friend_went_missing_and_someone_took_his_place/,My Friend Went Missing - and Someone Took His Place,"Look, I know this is going to sound crazy. Absolutely fucking crazy. Even as I write this out, the words in front of my eyes read as crazy. I still can‚Äôt believe this. But I have to get it out.

My parents don‚Äôt believe me. I had to stop bringing this up because I heard them whispering a few weeks ago that they were ‚Äúworried about my mental health‚Äù. I think they wanted to send me away for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, so I stopped talking about it to them. My friends think it‚Äôs a joke. And the police are basically on my parents side thinking I need help.
But I swear to you ‚Äì this is real.

~~~

It started with a simple night out. The two of us and our group of friends went to a shitty little dive bar that sits at the edge of town. The bartender there doesn‚Äôt care all that much about fake IDs, letting us weasel ourselves in to enjoy our night. Just a couple drinks and enjoy some music from the classic old jukebox, that was the plan.

Everything was fine.

We were having so much fun. Drinks around the table, dancing to the music. Laughing and singing (although we didn‚Äôt really know the words, but hey ‚Äì when you‚Äôre starting to have a blurred vision, matching words to lyrics don‚Äôt exactly matter at that point).

Evan smokes and while a couple of our mutual friends do as well, he took his smoke break at a different time. The others weren‚Äôt ready, they were enjoying a song, swaying in their seats and chattering loudly. It was cold that night and I didn‚Äôt exactly feel like standing outside while he took a good ole‚Äô fifteen to twenty minutes to smoke. So Evan went outside alone.

There was so many people in the bar. In and out. There were groups outside, blabbering loudly. One even got in a fight with each other ‚Äì over what, I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt care. A drunken mess is what I‚Äôm sure of. But there were so many eyes, so many people.

And yet ‚Äì Evan still disappeared. No one could say they saw him step out the door. No one could say they saw him step into the door. Apparently I‚Äôm the only one who had seen him leave the bar.

Everyone admits that Evan had obviously left, because he wasn‚Äôt seen after that.

For an entire fucking week.

I loved Evan. He was my best friend. We told each other everything.

I met Evan in Kindergarten. I was the shy new girl, having just moved to town in the middle of the year. All the other kids had their best friends who they played with and shared secrets with. Evan walked right up to me and shared his juice box to make sure I felt welcomed and from then, we were attached at the hips. Our mother‚Äôs used to joke with each other that we‚Äôd end up married one day. Joke was on them, because in high school when I got my first girlfriend it was only because Evan pushed me to ask her out, knowing exactly what I wanted before even I really did.

It was miserable without Evan around. I would look around every corner, check my phone every five minutes to see if he had texted or I missed his call by accident. I even found myself multiple times going to the clubhouse we built in the woods behind town. Our own little secret place. We built it the summer before sixth grade and promised that we would never tell anyone else that it existed.

That alone is why I‚Äôm here. Yes, I‚Äôm telling you about the clubouse, but it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.
Like I said ‚Äì Evan was gone for an entire fucking week.

I don‚Äôt know where he went, what he did, or who he was with. He won‚Äôt tell me shit still. I still check my phone for texts and missed calls, because when he returned it‚Äôs like our friendship has never existed. At least, not to the extent that it has for all these years.
He showed back up in the same shirt he had been at the bar in. It reeked of beer and body odor, as if the entire week he was gone he hadn‚Äôt showered. His arm had been cut and bandaged, but he wouldn‚Äôt tell me what happened.

Evan and I always shared everything. But now he‚Äôs not sharing anything.

That‚Äôs not Evan. Not the one I know anyway.
I know it sounds crazy. And you‚Äôre probably thinking he ended up drunk off his ass in a ditch somewhere or holed up at some chic‚Äôs apartment or whatever and just doesn‚Äôt want to tell me, but I don‚Äôt think so. This is what I believe in my heart.

When we were kids, Evan and I would meet on holiday break nights at the abandoned playground on the other side of town. No one ever knew we met there under the guise of the moon. We played on the old teeter-totter and swung in the old swings.
The playground still sits there. The metal of the swing set and the teeter-totter, and the slide are slowly rotting. I‚Äôve been going there at night lately, unable to stop myself, trying to relive those memories.

I texted Evan the second day he was back. Want to meet at eleven tonight? The old hangout?

He answered, where is that again?

We started going to that playground when we were in fourth grade. Evan‚Äôs big brother showed it to us one night and told us that only the ‚Äúcool kids‚Äù knew about it. We felt so special learning about it. It was our little secret.

I never gave Evan an answer about that. We spent nine years going to that playground in the night. How could he just‚Ä¶ forget about it? How could he not know what I meant?

We never go to the clubhouse at night. I‚Äôd never ask for that. The woods are dangerous here at night, you see. But that‚Äôs a different story for a different time.

Evan didn‚Äôt know where our hangout was for eleven at night? That isn‚Äôt right. That‚Äôs not a thing with Evan. Evan has never forgotten where we hang out or meet up. Evan is the punctual one. He‚Äôs the one who remembers all our birthdays and makes sure I take a bottle of water with me to work every day just so I don‚Äôt hydrate by drinking coffee only. He‚Äôs the one who keeps everything straight, not me. I can barely even function to get to work at six in the morning Monday through Friday for fuck‚Äôs sake. Evan though is like a goddamn superhero. Always up by four in the morning, doing his routine and out the door by five forty-five.

Well, he was a superhero anyway.

He sleeps until noon now and it up all hours of the night doing god knows what. We‚Äôre roommates ‚Äì did I mention that? So I hear him every night, walking around, talking to himself. Talking to himself. Evan doesn‚Äôt talk to himself. He never did.

Last night I left my room to see what he was doing. There was just so much noise going on. Dishes clattering, a couple shattering, and the nonstop walking. Its like he‚Äôs restless now. He won‚Äôt sit still for more than five minutes at a time, always getting up and moving around the apartment. Or just about anywhere we go or are.

Like yesterday for example, when we went to visit his parents, he did not once sit down. Just kept walking around the house. I peeked a few times and caught him studying the family photos, a lot of which I‚Äôm in (and he vice versa with my families photos). It was like he didn‚Äôt remember them. He even asked his mother about a beach trip we all took mine and Evan‚Äôs junior year of highschool. Just said he that for whatever reason, he convinced himself the picture had been different. Then he laughed about it.

This clipped sort of sound. His laugh was short, like it was forced and his smile most definitely didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. I can‚Äôt believe I actually wrote that though. I always thought it was a book thing, saying that smiles ‚Äúdon‚Äôt reach the eyes‚Äù. But it actually happened. When Evan smiles or laughs, the corners of his mouth curves upward but his eyes are blank, void of all emotion. Its so unnerving. The twinkle that used to sparkle in those blue eyes doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.

His mother was confused for a moment when Evan asked that question. But I think she‚Äôs just happy to have her son back, because she was smiling a moment later as if just brushing it off and deciding it didn‚Äôt matter. Maybe it was a momentary lapse in memory, I think she had decided. Of course she would. Evan‚Äôs mom is one of the sweetest women I‚Äôve ever met. And Evan is her baby. Of course she wouldn‚Äôt want to even begin to think about something else being wrong with him. In her mind, she almost lost him. He came back. That should be enough, especially for a mother.

But I know. Oh, I know.

I know in the way that Evan no longer adds emojis to his texts. I know in the way that he sits at the table, staring at his food and claims to have eaten earlier in the day, but I know better as I‚Äôm with him most of the time and he doesn‚Äôt eat other hours of the day either. I know in the way that sometimes in the very early hours of morning when I get up to take a piss, Evan is just sitting there staring at the tv. Staring, not watching. Because these early hours he usually has the tv off, just a black screen with his reflection staring back at him. And me behind him.

In those instances I catch his reflection staring back, his eyes are darker than ever before and he never smiles. He just stared, unblinking.

I tried to bring it up one more, pretending it was some weird thing in passing. But Evan only looked at me in question and then laughed that short, choppy laugh that doesn‚Äôt belong to him.

His laugh is deep and throaty and makes my chest sort of hurt when he laughs because of how contagious it is. This new laugh of his though? It makes me sad instead of wanting to smile or laugh. And that makes me even sadder. I miss Evan‚Äôs laugh the most of everything else.

Nobody believes me. I tell them what I‚Äôve noticed and they all laugh or shrug it off, rolling their eyes.
I tell them about the odd texts and the way Evan just doesn‚Äôt remember things and his laugh too. I try to tell them anyway, but nobody believes me.
I went to the police again when Evan was gone for another twenty-four hours. But it wasn‚Äôt long enough and he came back before ‚Äì why would he stay gone again?

He was sitting in front of the television turned off when I got up in the middle of the night again the next night. Scared the hell out of me and I quite literally pissed my pants because of him. He didn‚Äôt even blink, let alone look at me. He didn‚Äôt say a damn thing to me.

When I asked him about it the next morning, he acted like I was the crazy one.

Then he told me: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt gone, Dollie.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt gone? Yes he was! I‚Äôm not a fucking idiot. I didn‚Äôt imagine that shit. I know damn well I didn‚Äôt. So I pressed about the entire week he was gone. I got the same response; ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt gone, Dollie.‚Äù
He wasn‚Äôt gone? How the fuck was he not gone?
When we went to my mother‚Äôs for dinner that night, I brought it up at dinner. She was as confused as I was, but for a much different reason. Mom didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. Said Evan had never been gone.

I brought up the whole week he was gone and when I reminded her when it had happened, she reprimanded me for talking so poorly about well ‚Äì Evan‚Äôs misfortunes.

His‚Ä¶ misfortunes. What misfortunes? Mom got mad when I questioned it.

Evan has been acting even weirder around me since that dinner. I catch him staring a lot. When he realizes that I‚Äôve caught him, he looks away so quickly and goes about his business. He doesn‚Äôt blink. I swear he doesn‚Äôt fucking blink. I never see him blink. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre just going to say that I don‚Äôt catch it. But I know what I see and what I don‚Äôt see.

He just stares.

I keep asking about that week and those twenty-four hours, but Evan won‚Äôt tell me. He ignores me or just up and leaves when I bring it up.

It‚Äôs killing me he‚Äôs keeping secrets from me. Whatever this is, I‚Äôm sure I can handle it. As long as it means that my best friend comes back to me, I can handle whatever.

I tried telling him that too. Begged him to understand that whatever it is that‚Äôs going on, I can help him. I want to help him so badly. But he won‚Äôt tell me. He won‚Äôt accept my help. That‚Äôs not my Evan. My Evan would accept my help. I know he would.

That little boy who approached the shy little girl would never diss help offered.

I asked him this morning if he‚Äôd like to go to the clubhouse.

He asked me where it was. I‚Äôm not entirely sure he was paying full attention to me when I asked because a moment after he looked at me sharply and then stammered ‚Äì fucking stammered (Evan doesn‚Äôt stammer) that he‚Äôs too buy today. Too busy? No, I get that, I really do. But its like he‚Äôs starting to realize that I‚Äôve been picking at the things that Evan should know. And whoever ‚Äì whatever ‚Äì this is that is playing the role of Evan has now decided to to jump hoops in order to avoid having to admit he doesn‚Äôt know a damn thing about my best friend.

But I know better.

I know better.

I waited until Evan left earlier. I pretended to drop the topic when he said he was too busy and planted my butt on the couch, watching some mindless sitcom that was on tv. I wasn‚Äôt really interested in it, just waited for Evan to leave. Because if he was so damn busy, then he‚Äôd have to leave if I wasn‚Äôt. Just to make sure that I couldn‚Äôt start asking him to go somewhere he didn‚Äôt know with me.

It worked.

After he was gone, I snuck into his room. I had to know, find something so people would believe me. So that way no one would think I was crazy and want to send me away. I needed something to make people listen. To make the fucking police listen.
You have to understand I wasn‚Äôt trying to be a snoop. I‚Äôm an only child. Evan is the brother I never got. He is everything to me. I‚Äôd do anything for him.

And‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I did. I did do anything for him.
The clubhouse is more then just a place we go to hangout. We didn‚Äôt just build it in the woods randomly on a whim. My backyard has a couple giant trees we could‚Äôve built it in so easily. Our parents remind us of that all the time. They like to joke we were being rebellious when we chose to put it in the woods, away from all prying eyes. (They know we built one, but have never been able to find it.)

We built it to keep our biggest secret.
There are three things only Evan and I know about.

1) The playground
2) The clubhouse
3) The girl I killed in high school

She‚Äôs buried at the base of the tree the clubhouse is built on. We take flowers every time we visit, every time we go to the clubhouse.

Well, we did.

I realized that one week it‚Äôs going to get hard putting flowers on two graves that are miles apart from now on. Maybe just different days I suppose.
I didn‚Äôt mean to. I truly didn‚Äôt. It just‚Ä¶ it just happened.

He reminded me.

Because in his room‚Ä¶ it was just so very different. He‚Äôs taken the bed out. In its place is a pile of dirt. Literal fucking dirt. I think he sleeps on it or something, I don‚Äôt fucking know. But there‚Äôs no bed so where else does he sleep?

He changed his curtains to black out ones, not even an ounce of sun can get through them, shut tight against the world as if desperate to ensure to block it all out. And it‚Ä¶ reeks.

I know the stench too well.

Smoldering in the dark is the rancid smell of death.
I know for sure it isn‚Äôt Evan now.

Because when I left his room, I left the apartment and came to the playground. I‚Äôve never been here in the daytime before. I can see the rust eating through the metal. One of the swings dangles by one chain by now. The seesaw sits untouched, grass rising above it, nearly hiding it. But beneath the slide the mound of dirt is there.

Except‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs disturbed. Opened up like someone crawled up from beneath.

But I know I left him beneath there.

I didn‚Äôt mean to. You have to believe me. He‚Äôs my best friend, my brother. I just got so angry. I don‚Äôt even really remember why ‚Äì I was drunk. But I was angry and I smashed the bottle over his head.

I didn‚Äôt mean to.

Evan would understand. He‚Äôs always understood me. He‚Äôs the only one who ever has.

But I don‚Äôt think this thing wearing his face will understand very well.

I know because he‚Äôs staring at me right now from across the playground. In that unblinking, unmoving way that he does.",1,1745078864.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

the context is as such: i live in a humid country in asia and my problem is that above my wooden table, is a wooden cabinet (carpented in, so they are fixed in place) and i‚Äôm afraid of issues arising such as mold, moisture absorption, etc. that may damage the wood. if i do get it, it‚Äôll be right next to the window so ventilation would be fine.

i was wondering if this set up idea would work? and also, if there are any solutions like a stick-on slab i can have on the underside (picture) of the wooden cabinets?",1,1745078828.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I have a Freewrite Traveler purchased around 2022-ish that I used heavily for a while, but ultimately rage quit. I'm an author by profession and write 6-8 hours a day M-F, and though I imported and started a new file daily, the Traveler lag was totally untenable for me. My typing accuracy was awful, and I hated that the lag was so severe that I couldn't backspace anything because I never knew where the cursor was going to stop. I also had issues with ghost typing and dropped keystrokes, which was ultimately what made me quit the device.

I love distraction-free writing and am on a perpetual hunt for the perfect writer deck device. I keep returning to the AlphaSmart Neo 2, which I absolutely love, but would love a nicer keyboard and a newer device to ease reliability worries (the thing is 20+ years old, after all).

I love how nice and sturdy the Smart Typewriter looks. I do often write in coffee shops but I'm just walking from the car to my seat so I'm not super concerned about portability. My biggest worry is the lag and typing quality after my experience with the Traveler.

Can anyone with a newer Smart Typewriter speak to the degree of lag? I know this is sort of a subjective question, since I've heard many users describe the Traveler lag as unnoticeable, whereas for me it was debilitating... especially in combination with the phantom keystrokes.

FWIW, I have a Remarkable, also an eink screen, and I don't notice any lag typing on that. Totally different than my Traveler. So I don't have unrealistic standards, I promise! :)",1,1745078820.0,Astrohaus,0,1.0,False

I (late 20s, M) met a guy at my school library who I‚Äôll call¬†*Charles*. We started hanging out almost every day. I felt safe opening up to him about serious stuff ‚Äî childhood bullying, family issues, past mental health struggles (including suicidal thoughts). He was a good listener, and even introduced me to his church and his circle of friends.

Over time, I noticed some red flags. He and his brother started bringing up politics ‚Äî mainly defending Donald Trump ‚Äî and slowly tried to sway my views. I made it clear I wasn‚Äôt a supporter, and Charles asked me what¬†*percentage*¬†of my political views were influenced by my dad (a Democrat). I said I didn‚Äôt want to get into it and felt boxed in.

The next day, I told him his comments felt arrogant and asked for an apology. He refused to do it over text and insisted we meet in person. After a lot of back and forth, we met ‚Äî I even bought him a coffee ‚Äî but instead of an apology, I got insulted. He told me I had low self-esteem, said I was trying to ""bring him down to my level,"" and even told me the devil was speaking through me. He tried to force prayer on me, asked for a hug (I declined), and overall made me feel completely disrespected and belittled. I walked away from the friendship after that.

Since then, I‚Äôve stopped going to the church group. People from church text me asking where I‚Äôve been, and I just say I‚Äôm busy with school/work to avoid drama. His brother even deleted me off LinkedIn. Now when Charles sees me, he tries to act like nothing happened ‚Äî gives me a fist bump and says ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up bro,‚Äù which I reciprocate just to avoid conflict. But it feels performative, like he‚Äôs trying to stay in my head.

I‚Äôm worried he might be telling people about personal things I shared ‚Äî including that I once had suicidal thoughts ‚Äî to make me look unstable or gain sympathy.

**SEA OTTER CLASSIC BIKE FESTIVAL 2025 TRIP REPORT**

**ARRIVAL** - 8 p.m. Wednesday night 

Pretty dark, but not pitch black - flood light (w generator). Camp is neither super quiet nor super dark, so ***I was glad to have eye-mask/earplugs.*** 

Field is grassy, but with bumps and holes. Don‚Äôt need big car, but proceed with caution. Campground host helped us find our site. Bathrooms are porta-potties, but they were in good shape. 

Lots of RVs/campers at the site. Some tents too. 

Set up tents, did some yoga/stretching, had food, went to sleep.

**THURSDAY AM - CIRCUIT RACE**

Up early, headed over to hospitality tent at 6 a.m. sharp to get our numbers. There were only a few folks waiting. Wasn‚Äôt a huge line. First day of the festival, volunteers were still getting used to the system, but I got our numbers for both races. AND: ***Wristbands (these are important to get into the expo - they do check!!!), and meal tickets (also important if you want free food).***  

Race was set to start at 7:15. I think we set out from campground I (eye) at around 7, we weren‚Äôt sure exactly where we were going. We ended up on the track, did a half lap, and got to the start line about 2 mins before race start. Perfectly timed! haha

Weather wise, it‚Äôs cold, and SUPER foggy. It was a really cool scene. Very surreal and almost eerie. 

Race kicks off promptly, and it starts with an incline, and then a steep climb. That climb is where the race is won or lost (if you‚Äôre trying to win) - for me, my strategy was to pace myself, let the lead group go if necessary, and just ride my own race. 

From my point of view, things got spread out quickly. I did the climb, then bombed down the corkscrew. The rest of the race, I don‚Äôt remember much. I was alone for much of the time, focusing on the folks in front of me, just dark blurs in the fog, riding to catch up. At one point, three of us teamed up into a little chase group, and that was fun. When we got to the climb, one dude just sent it up, the other dude dropped back, and I was alone again.

I guess I was ahead of some folks, because on another round of the climb, I saw my buddy with a group gaining on me. I put in an effort, and pretty soon three of us were going down the corkscrew. It was after that, on a left-hand curve, that one of my buddies slid out/ crashed. I saw it happen, and I stopped to stay with him. 

He was OK, the left side of body had some road rash, and his helmet did take an impact. One of the motos pulled over to form a barrier, and I got the bike off the road. 

***This was one of the snafus of the event for me: It took the medical team a long time to arrive to check out my friend.*** He was alert and talking, but the moto advised him to stay on the ground, laying down, and wait for a concussion check. So we‚Äôre both there, honestly, freezing our butts off, and then, we see the ambulance coming over near the track. But‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt get in the gate‚Ä¶ and they are waiting there for a while. Then they drive off. And we‚Äôre waiting. Cold‚Ä¶ In our kit. When the ambulance finally got there, I swear it had been 20 mins‚Ä¶

So, I‚Äôm not one to complain, but, when you‚Äôre putting on a bike race, or any race, it would be a good idea to have medical ready to respond to any area of the track quickly. It could literally be a life or death situation. 

My friend also told me that when they took him to the first medical tent, they weren‚Äôt ready, and so, he was taken to another medical tent. ***Overall, it was probably an hour before he got treatment. I think Sea Otter can do better.***

***There was one more safety issue with the race.*** I Did Not Finish, as noted above, but two of my buddies did, possibly toward the back of the pack - difficult to tell in the fog. As they were coming in super hot toward the finish, THE NEXT RACERS were already lining up. So yeah‚Ä¶ that could have been bad too.

**POST RACE**

We spent a while with the crashed bike, trying to get it either to its rider or to bike valet. Going around in circles. That was the first time we got lost. Also the first time we got stopped for not having wristbands. Freezing cold, lost, trying to do a good deed, we were not happy to get stopped and not allowed to pass. (every racer gets full expo access, but the security guard was insistent that we show our wristbands, and wouldn‚Äôt let us pass because we didn't have them). ***I won‚Äôt dwell on it, but just suffice to say - everything will be easier if you just carry/wear your wristband.***

The three of us, and one friend we made during the race went back to our campsite to debrief. Then changed clothes and headed into the expo. 

First stop: Our free lunch. It was actually really good! You got chips, a cookie, a nice rice bowl with chicken (not sure about vegan/veg options), and a beer, or NA beer. 

Then we hit the Muc-Off bike-wash station, which was cool. (don‚Äôt forget to re-lube your chain after! We planned to do it back at camp with our special chain lube, but totally forgot, of course). Then we wandered the expo for a while. 

Note: Cell phone service was spotty to non-existent during the event, likely due to the masses of people in one place. My T-Mobile phone was basically useless. I think AT&T folks were doing better. But that‚Äôs something to know. 

The expo is a SCENE! Tons of booths, most of the big bike and component companies are there, and a TON of smaller companies. Super interesting to just wander around check our different products, chat with folks, maybe grab some swag. I was on the hunt for stickers, in particular. 

One thing I learned about the expo is that it‚Äôs set up more as a Trade Show than for retail sales. Some booths are selling, and having deals, but it‚Äôs not like a biking swap meet or anything. A lot of booths have cool stuff on display,  but it‚Äôs not for sale. I will say, on the last day, some booths were selling - like Cinelli for example, was selling their display models - for what they said was a big discount, like 30-40% off‚Ä¶

But my plan to stock up on bike gear‚Ä¶ was only partially successful. And I manage to lose a pair of gloves and a water bottle at different times over the weekend‚Ä¶ 


**GROUP RIDE & WEATHER NOTES**

Later Friday we met up for a MAAP group ride, which was going to a brewery in Monterey for a panel discussion. My friends told me this ride would be ‚Äúchill,‚Äù famous last words lol! 

It‚Äôs not that it was super fast or anything, but it was a decent amount of climbing, like 3k of elevation. Some fun descents too. I almost got into trouble sending it down a descent. I was tucking, probably doing like 30 mph or so, when I saw ahead a stop sign and a dead-end. I basically had to slam the brakes, the bike fishtailed a bit, but thankfully I didn‚Äôt go down. Lesson: Be careful sending descents you don‚Äôt know, and when riding with groups you‚Äôre not familiar with. It would have been nice if someone had called out ‚Äúslowing‚Äù or something, but in the end, we‚Äôre all responsible for ourselves on the bike.  

We got to the brewery, and then, after chatting and hanging for a bit, we bailed. We picked up one extra rider who had gotten dropped on the way over, and he made sure he got back home safe. 

Group ride strava activity: https://www.strava.com/activities/14143120369

This is as good of a time as any to say that the area where Sea Otter is - Laguna Seca / Monterey / Salinas is really beautiful. Rolling hills. Super green at this type of year. Misty, foggy, cold mornings giving way to sunny breezy days, and then cold again at night. My friend gave me this advice on the event, and it proved true: ***‚ÄúBe prepared for anything, from very cold to very hot.‚Äù***

We often saw both those extremes in the same day. And even when it was sunny, it could still be chilly, due to the breezes. Layering is essential, both on and off the bike!

I managed to pick up some sunburn on my face and neck; overall I got a A LOT of sun over the 4 days, so if you're sensitive to that, make preparations! 

**FRIDAY - BACK AT THE EXPO**

I was having HELLA technology issues on the first couple days. My phone wasn‚Äôt getting service, and then it wasn‚Äôt charging, and it died, and stayed dead for like 2 days. My shiny new power pedals, which I had put into ‚Äútravel mode‚Äù using the app, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to turn them back on with my phone dead. So, I rode the circuit race without it. Not a huge deal.

What WAS a huge deal is that I wanted to check my Strava, just see how fast I got around the track, how fast I went on the corkscrew, etc. I did find that certain areas got service, and I found a little hill where I managed to get on Strava before my phone died, and got some numbers, so that was good. After a race or hard effort, it‚Äôs just nice to see how you did, ya know? 

Friday, I was planning to rest, because we had a big Fondo coming up Saturday. I was up early, and I made my way to the expo. (I think I was planning to go to the Hospitality Tent, which is kind of like event HQ, but I somehow found myself in the expo‚Ä¶) 

The expo... man‚Ä¶ what can I say. It‚Äôs like a maze in there! I would strongly advise: Print a copy of the map before you go, and try to orient yourself with the main entrances and exits, and landmarks. I was literally wandering around in the expo for hours, having fun, but also completely lost. 

You can kind of get free breakfast in the expo, between the booths giving out snacks and granola bars and fruit, and a couple that are doing espresso drinks. Friday morning, I got a dirty chai at the Salsa booth, and then played their Bingo game, which meant running around to a couple different booths. 

By 10 a.m., it was getting hot, and I was still dressed for the cold morning, and so‚Ä¶ yeah, layers‚Ä¶ be ready for quick changes in temp. I finished bingo, and I think that was one of my biggest accomplishments of the weekend. : D

They said they had only 250 total bingo cards, and some good prizes, so I figured it would be fun to try to knock that out and maybe win something. I am eagerly checking my email inbox to see if I won anything!

One super fun to-do at the Expo is demo-ing bikes. There‚Äôs a road demo area (part of the racetrack), and a mountain-bike demo area, which I didn‚Äôt see. Over in the demo area I was talking to this bike brand called Upland, and not only did I demo their bike, but I did a little photo shoot with them, just for funsies. So that was lowkey hilarious and random. 

Protip: The track (portions of it) are open for demos, which means that pretty much anyone can get on the track and ride. Definitely take advantage of that! 

Protip two: If you're local at all, the Laguna Seca raceway opens up the track once a month for recreational riding, and I guess everyone hops on, from fast folks in pace-lines, to families...  Would like to check that out for sure!

My two buddies wanted to ride on the Monterey coast Friday night, but I bailed on that, opting to rest for the Fondo. I ended up hanging around the campground, partying a bit with folks from the Santa Cruz bike company, and watching teenagers jump bikes over a fire, which is tradition, I learned. 

Eventually, I got to sleep, with the big Fondo looming.

**SATURDAY - GRAND FONDO**

I always wake up early while camping, so I was up well before the 7:30 Fondo start time, but we still managed to get to the start line late, at like 7:45. 

There‚Äôs a shorter Fondo and a longer one, and we happened to start with the group doing the shorter one. This was fine, but it caused us to veer off course by accident, and double back, so we could get back onto our 90-mile route. (We ended up doing 100 miles, which, I guess, was our plan all along kind of, to round out the century‚Ä¶)

So - just advice for all long Fondo-type rides. Have the route with you if possible, because you can‚Äôt count on the signs/volunteers. This route was pretty well-signed, and overall well-organized, but we had bad luck and got off track.

Not gonna lie: the 90-mile fondo was tough. Much tougher than we had anticipated. For some reason, I thought it would be like 3-4k feet of elevation. We ended up doing 7k. A little of that was the ‚Äúextra credit‚Äù we did, but I need to go back and figure out why my expectations were so wrong‚Ä¶ 

Of course, it didn‚Äôt help that none of us were at 100%. E was nursing nagging injuries. N wasn‚Äôt sleeping well at the campsite, and had crashed on a mountain bike demo, and I was a little tired/groggy/hungover.  

Before we started, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, with rest stops at every 20 miles or so. I think we went out a little hot, burned some matches too early, and then, the sun came out, and then, a lot of climbing. 

The rest stops were pretty good - salty and sweet snacks, water and sports drink. No real food like sandwiches or anything. 

I did watch the route-talk that Sea Otter put out for this route, but I still wasn‚Äôt prepared for how challenging it would be. Particularly brutal was the [Laurles Grade](https://www.strava.com/activities/14161040676/segments/3346333953613455238), a steep and pretty long climb. That comes at the end. I was in my easiest gear, just doing my best to keep pedaling. At one point I felt nauseous and wondered if I could just throw up without stopping. I‚Äôm pretty sure I was fueled and hydrated. It was just a really tough effort.

I‚Äôm super glad I trained a bit on climbing before Sea Otter. I knew just to be patient, go slow, and spin up the hill as best as I could. Eventually I made it to the top of the grade, waited for my two friends, and we bombed down together. 

As we (finally), pulled into the racetrack grounds, I‚Äôm shouting to the volunteers ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the finish line?!‚Äù they are like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, just keep going.‚Äù

We‚Äôre all going fast now, just happy to be done, we come around a curve, and there‚Äôs volunteers with medals standing in the middle of the road next to a text saying ‚Äúslow down slow down!‚Äù So that was a little funny. No arch, no photographer, no music, no crowd, just the end. We got our medals.

From there, you can either bike back to the campground, which involves some short, steep climbs, or take a shuttle. We three had said we would take the shuttle. My two buddies decided to bike back, and I opted to wait for the shuttle. 

At that point, my bike computer was reading 100.0 miles, so while waiting for the shuttle, I just rode in circles a bit, so Strava wouldn‚Äôt give me the dreaded 99.9 miles. The shuttle took a minute to arrive. And the bikes go back on a truck. Back at the expo area, I had to wait a good 20 mins or more for my bike, so I was glad I had a long-sleeve. I sat next to some volunteers and cried a little bit. I don‚Äôt know why. I just sobbed. That fondo/century was probably the hardest physical effort I‚Äôve ever done‚Ä¶ 

I wanted to go to the meal tent to get my free meal (it‚Äôs best to have your meal ticket, but if you have a race number, you can probably get in). But peeking into the expo, I knew I‚Äôd get lost, especially in my depleted state. But‚Ä¶ I had no money, and my phone was still dead. Miraculously, I ran into two bike buddies from L.A. We took a pic, and then one of them lent me $20, which I immediately used to buy BBQ, sat on the ground, and feasted on.

***Lesson: Don't count on being ""babied"" at the finish line like in a running race where you get a banana and a heat blanket and water. Sea Otter is really big, there are a ton of races, and I gleaned, basically, that each rider is expected to be self-sufficient more or less.*** (I mean, this was a supported ride, and we had good snacks along the way, but at the end, of what I would call a bike ""marathon,"" there wasn't any bananas or water or anything... just good to know for next time...) 

Grand Fondo Strava - I finally did get my power meter working: https://www.strava.com/activities/14161040676/overview

**SATURDAY NIGHT - THINGS GET LIT - UNTIL THE COPS SHOW UP**

I guess it‚Äôs a tradition at Sea Otter for the ‚Äúteenagers,‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I put that in quotes, they are totally teenagers, to jump bikes over a fire pit. Starting in the afternoon they dig a big hole, and use the dirt to make a ramp. Then folks roll down the hill and jump over the fire, sometimes doing tricks and things. 

The crowd packs in tight, there is some drinking involved, and I saw some close calls where a bike almost went into the crowd at full speed. I also saw a kid almost get nailed by a bike, like a child. 

***So‚Ä¶ definitely, the fire-jumping is good entertainment, but be aware of your personal safety at all times.***

So‚Ä¶ I was hanging around the fire-jumping. My phone was finally charged (The issue was lint in the charging port, and I think a bad cable as well), and I wanted to get some photos. 

Things got a little ugly. I guess the teenagers had been warned not to set off fireworks, due to rules from the venue (probably wildfire related). But, sure enough, fireworks were going off, and the security guards came to try to shut things down. 

There was a lot of yelling and arguing. One of the young security guards told me he had once been among these bike teenagers, and at one point he was literally in the middle of the mob, having heated arguments with the kids. 

Eventually his supervisor came out, an older man, and he too got into heated arguments with the kids. He was shining his flashlight in one kid‚Äôs face as they argued, and I guess the kid slapped the flashlight out of his hand (I was blocked and didn‚Äôt see this directly). I was also told that the flashlight flew into the crowd and hit someone square in the face‚Ä¶ 

So after that, the sheriffs came and shut down the jumping, and make one kid dis-assemble the jump. It‚Äôs too bad about the fireworks. Other than that, security was OK letting the kids jump, at least until 10 p.m. But in the kids‚Äô defense, you can‚Äôt control what everyone does, and if some ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù are setting off fireworks, it ruins the fun for everyone.

At one point I was trying to like, make peace between security and the kids. Security actually seemed pretty reasonable, and if the teenagers had had a more reasonable spokesperson, maybe a compromise could have been reached. But overall, I think this cat and mouse game happens every year, and for the teenagers, honestly it‚Äôs probably part of the entertainment. I was told that the fire-jumping was crazier in past years, with cars coming onto the grass to do donuts, and other shenanigans. 

**SUNDAY MORNING COMING DOWN**

By Sunday I was tired, but I had slept pretty well Saturday night, after the fire jumping, and I had a couple things I wanted to do. I finally made it to the hospitality tent, and found they had reasonably priced coffee/donuts and breakfast burritos. I had two coffees and two donuts, and that gave me strength‚Ä¶ 

***My main goal for the day: Check out some bike racing!***

There are tons of races and rides at Sea Otter. A lot of them go off-road and cross-country, so you can‚Äôt really spectate. The two that I know you CAN watch are mountain-downhill and double-slalom. I never did figure out how to reach the double-slalom course to watch, which is too bad, because it looks super cool. (two riders head-to-head on a downhill course.) But I did find out that the downhill course was right next to my campground! So Sunday morning I walked over to try to get some photos and check out the riding.

It was super cool. Folks just absolutely sending it down a course. With jumps, curves‚Ä¶ I was told it was ‚Äúflowy.‚Äù Super cool to be there, and see the bikes zoom by‚Ä¶ 

Later Sunday, I went back to the expo, to connect with the brand I‚Äôd demo‚Äôd and done the photo shoot with. I did another demo, and hung with them for a bit. My plan was to cruise the expo and try to score some nice sunglasses, but by the time I made it out, most places were packing up after a long weekend, and I didn‚Äôt want to bother them. ***Sunday morning, earlier, would probably be the best time to try to get some deals, of demo/sample stuff at least.*** I did stop by one booth selling glasses, 100% or something like that, but the lowest they would go for a sample pair was $100, and I wasn‚Äôt ready to buy at that price. I did score a free small bottle of Super Secret Chain Lube; Silca was packing up, and I rolled by and was like ‚Äúy‚Äôall got any more of that super secret?!‚Äù - and they hooked me up.

Cruised around the expo for a bit; it was all over but the shouting. Made my way back to camp. Got packed up‚Ä¶

My camp neighbors were super friendly, and we had kind of made friends over the course of the weekend, in particular bonding over our shared quests for swag. They told me that they book the same spot each year, and their campground neighbors do too, so everyone kind of knows each other. I will definitely try to go back next year, and if I do, I‚Äôll try to book in that same area‚Ä¶

**Overall, Sea Otter was fun, exhausting, a physical and mental challenge. The combination of camping and endurance riding pushed me to my limits. I came out of the weekend feeling good, feeling confident, feeling happy. My heart was warmed, and my legs were tired.**",1,1745077375.0,cycling,0,1.0,False

But that wasn‚Äôt even the craziest part,"I work as a nurse in a hospital with a psych unit nearby. One night, we admitted a patient‚ÄîDaniel, mid-30s, incredibly well-spoken, dressed like he came straight out of a GQ shoot. His diagnosis? Delusional disorder. His delusion? He was a surgeon. Not just any surgeon‚Äîhe claimed to be a trauma specialist with ‚Äú17 years of experience‚Äù and a r√©sum√© longer than my shift.

At first, he was compliant. Then on my night shift, during the usual rounds, we realized: Daniel was gone.

Nowhere in his room. Not in the bathroom. Panic hits. We start scanning every hallway. Then security calls in:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found your patient‚Ä¶ in the OR lounge.‚Äù

Daniel had stolen a discarded white coat, put on a surgical mask, grabbed a clipboard, and started making rounds in the OR like he owned the place. He even logged into a nurse‚Äôs computer and was reviewing the OR schedule like he had a 7 AM appendectomy coming up.

The only reason we caught him? He poured himself a coffee and added five Splendas. An anesthesiologist immediately said, ‚ÄúNo real doctor uses five Splendas. That‚Äôs a red flag.‚Äù (Which is now a running joke in our unit.)

Here‚Äôs where it gets even crazier.

After we got Daniel back into the psych ward, I mentioned the incident during our morning huddle. One of the older surgeons, Dr. Patel, went pale and said, ‚ÄúWait. Did he say his name was Daniel Carter?‚Äù

Turns out‚Ä¶ there really was a Daniel Carter. A rising-star trauma surgeon who went missing seven years ago after a massive breakdown following a fatal OR incident. Same age. Same look. Same specialty.

Now we‚Äôre all wondering‚Äîwas this really a delusional patient‚Ä¶
or was it actually Dr. Daniel Carter, who‚Äôs been living out his ‚Äúdelusion‚Äù ever since?

We still don‚Äôt know.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Work Flexibility with Remote Online Jobs

 In today's digital age, many people are seeking online jobs that fit their unique schedules. The idea of working at any hour of the day or night, from the comfort of home, is increasingly appealing. Whether you are a night owl, an early riser, or someone juggling other responsibilities, these remote jobs offer the flexibility you need without sacrificing income potential.

### Freelance Writing and Content Creation

 One of the most popular online jobs that can be done at any hour is freelance writing. Content creators are always in demand, generating articles, blog posts, newsletters, and social media updates for clients worldwide. The beauty of this work is that deadlines often revolve around word counts and delivery dates rather than strict office hours. You can write when creativity strikes ‚Äî be it morning, afternoon, or late at night.

 Platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer offer thousands of writing projects where you can apply your skills. If you enjoy storytelling or sharing knowledge, this job not only fits flexible hours but can also evolve into a lucrative career.

### Virtual Assistance

 Companies and entrepreneurs hire virtual assistants (VAs) to help manage tasks remotely, including email management, scheduling, and basic customer inquiries. Since clients may be located across various time zones, VAs often perform duties at different times, accommodating a global schedule. This shift in work timing means you can pick assignments that allow for night or early morning hours.

### Online Tutoring and Teaching

 The rise of e-learning has opened doors for tutors and instructors who want to work remotely without time constraints. Teaching platforms let you connect with students worldwide, offering lessons in languages, math, science, and other subjects. Because these students live in diverse time zones, you might sometimes teach late into the night or early in the morning.

 This flexibility not only helps you create a schedule that suits your life but also enables you to maximize earning potential by catering to international learners.

### Transcription Jobs

 If you are a quick and accurate listener and typer, transcription work may be a good fit. This job involves converting audio or video recordings into written text. Transcription companies frequently accept projects 24/7, so you can choose when to complete your assignments.

 You might find yourself transcribing interviews, podcasts, or legal depositions during quieter parts of your day or night. The ability to work at any time allows for excellent work-life balance.

### Graphic Design and Digital Art

 Graphic designers often enjoy a freelance lifestyle that perfectly suits flexible hours. Designing logos, advertisements, or website graphics can be done independently and remotely. Deadlines are typically negotiated with clients, meaning you decide when your creative energy flows best.

 Tools like Adobe Creative Suite and Canva make it simple to work from anywhere, anytime. Plus, thriving online marketplaces allow designers to sell artwork or templates without being confined to traditional office hours.

### Customer Support Representative

 Many companies require customer support agents around the clock to assist their global clients. Remote customer service jobs often divide shifts to cover all time zones, making night or early morning roles possible. If you enjoy helping people and problem solving, this role offers both flexibility and steady work.

### Data Entry and Microtasks

 For those looking for straightforward jobs with flexible timing, data entry and microtasks are ideal. Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Clickworker provide short gigs that can be done whenever you have free moments. Tasks include filling forms, categorizing images, or checking information accuracy.

 These micro-jobs don‚Äôt require deep focus for long periods, making them perfect to fit in around other commitments or at unconventional hours.

### Tips to Succeed in Flexible Remote Work

- **Create a dedicated workspace:** Having a comfortable, quiet spot helps improve focus regardless of the hour.
- **Set clear boundaries:** Communicate your availability to clients or employers to avoid burnout from working around the clock.
- **Manage time wisely:** Use scheduling tools to plan work sessions based on when you feel most productive.
- **Keep learning:** Upskill regularly to stay competitive and access higher-paying opportunities.
 
### Why Choose Online Jobs That Offer Round-the-Clock Flexibility?

 The greatest benefit of jobs that can be done remotely at any hour is how they accommodate personal lifestyles. Parents, students, caregivers, or anyone with unique daily routines find such opportunities invaluable. You gain autonomy over when and where to work without sacrificing income, which empowers better work-life balance.

 Additionally, the global economy's shift toward remote work means more companies operate across time zones. This reality creates constant demand for remote workers able to meet clients where they are, whether it is day or night.

 If you seek a career or side hustle that doesn‚Äôt tie you down to a 9-to-5 schedule, exploring flexible remote jobs is a smart move. From writing and tutoring to graphic design and customer support, the perfect role that fits your day or night rhythm is out there.

</div>Tips for Staying Productive and Managing Time When Working Remote Jobs with Flexible Hours
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Creating a Dedicated Workspace

When you‚Äôre working a remote job that allows you to choose your hours, it‚Äôs tempting to work from bed or the couch. However, setting up a dedicated workspace can significantly boost your focus and productivity. Choose a quiet area with minimal distractions, good lighting, and ergonomic furniture. This physical separation signals your brain that it‚Äôs time to work, helping you concentrate better even at odd hours.

### Setting Clear Goals and Priorities

Flexible hours give you freedom, but without clear goals, it‚Äôs easy to lose track of time. Every day, outline the tasks you need to accomplish. Break your work into manageable chunks and prioritize the most important tasks first. You can use digital tools like to-do lists, calendars, or apps designed for task management. When you know exactly what you must achieve, it‚Äôs easier to stay motivated and avoid procrastination.

### Managing Time Effectively Using Techniques

Time management techniques can help you make the most of your flexible schedule. Here are a few popular methods:

- **Pomodoro Technique:** Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four rounds, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This method balances focused work with necessary rest, preventing burnout.
- **Time Blocking:** Allocate specific periods in your day for different tasks or projects. Even if your schedule is flexible, setting aside blocks of time can create a structured rhythm.
- **2-Minute Rule:** If a task can be done in two minutes or less, do it immediately. This prevents small tasks from piling up and becoming overwhelming.
 
### Utilizing Technology to Stay Organized

Many tools are available to help you manage your workload and stay on top of deadlines when working remotely. Cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox keep your files accessible from anywhere. Communication platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams allow quick interactions with coworkers without waiting for email replies. Calendar apps can send you reminders and set up virtual meetings seamlessly.

Using a mix of these digital solutions keeps your workflow smooth and reduces the chance of missing important tasks or meetings, essential when your work hours might differ from traditional schedules.

### Maintaining a Work-Life Balance

Working flexible hours remotely often blurs the line between your professional and personal life. To stay productive without feeling burnt out, it‚Äôs important to create boundaries:

- **Define Work Hours:** Even if you choose your schedule, stick to consistent working times. Let family or housemates know when you shouldn‚Äôt be disturbed.
- **Take Breaks:** Use regular break times to stretch, walk outside, or rest your eyes. This helps maintain energy levels and keeps your mind sharp.
- **End Your Day Properly:** Once your designated work time is over, shut down your computer and avoid checking emails. This separation helps recharge for the next day.
 
### Handling Distractions Smartly

Remote work can introduce many distractions‚Äîfrom social media to household chores or noisy environments. Recognize what usually distracts you and take steps to minimize these interruptions.

You might try tools like website blockers during work periods to avoid endless scrolling. Noise-canceling headphones can help if background noise is a challenge. Communicating your schedule clearly to those around you also reduces unexpected disturbances.

### Adjusting Your Routine to Match Your Productivity Peaks

A key benefit of flexible remote jobs is working when you feel most productive. Some people focus best early in the morning, while others hit their stride late at night. Pay attention to your energy and concentration levels throughout the day.

Plan to tackle demanding or creative tasks during these peak times. Leave less intensive or routine activities for when your focus wanes. This self-awareness maximizes output while making your workday feel less draining.

### Staying Connected and Motivated

Remote jobs with flexible hours can sometimes feel isolating. Staying connected with colleagues or peers helps maintain motivation and accountability.

Schedule regular check-ins or virtual coffee breaks. Share your progress and challenges to foster a sense of teamwork. Being part of a community reduces feelings of loneliness and keeps you committed to your goals.

### Regular Self-Check-Ins

At the end of each day or week, evaluate how well your time management and productivity strategies are working. Ask yourself questions like:

- Did I complete my top priorities?
- What distracted me the most?
- How did I feel energy-wise at different points in the day?
- What can I improve tomorrow?
 
Reflecting regularly helps you identify what‚Äôs effective and where adjustments are needed, ensuring continued growth and productivity despite a flexible schedule.

</div>### Conclusion

Finding online jobs that can be done at any hour of the day or night opens up a world of opportunities for people seeking flexibility and freedom from traditional work schedules. Whether you‚Äôre interested in freelance writing, virtual assistance, customer support, or other remote roles, these jobs allow you to tailor your work hours to fit your lifestyle. This flexibility is especially valuable if you‚Äôre juggling family responsibilities, pursuing education, or simply prefer working during non-standard hours.

However, enjoying flexible hours also comes with the need to stay disciplined and manage your time wisely. Establishing a structured routine, setting clear goals, and using productivity tools can help you maintain focus even when working without fixed schedules. Balancing flexibility with organization ensures you meet deadlines, avoid burnout, and deliver quality work consistently.

By exploring the variety of online jobs available and adopting effective time management strategies, you can create a rewarding remote work experience that fits your personal rhythm. Embracing these flexible opportunities not only increases your earning potential but also improves your overall work-life harmony. As you navigate this new way of working, remember that success comes from blending freedom with smart planning‚Äîand that makes all the difference in building a sustainable and enjoyable remote career.

Why? Does the amount of and duration of usage cause differences? 

I'm reaching out in hopes of getting some stories from people who have had a similar intake as myself.  I drank pop as a teen, but it wasn't until I was an adult that I began to drink coffee. I had one cup of coffee a day and the additional cup of cold brew or coffee.. As of this past year, pop has become a non-factor. One cup of coffee a day had been my only source of caffeine for about the last year. I have been regularly consuming coffee for about four or five years, TOPS. (And that is estimating, as I picked up the habit and it didn't immediately become an everyday thing.) Obviously, my dosage over these five years has varied, but I'm only focusing on my dosage from the last year -> one cup of ground coffee. It was VERY rare that I had a second cup in the past year. 

I quit cold turkey 19 days ago. Im struggling with insomnia. I am having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, mostly. 

I have noticeable heart palpitations throughout the day, and a lot when I'm trying to fall asleep. I can see it in my stomach sometimes, and last night I physically felt it in the back of my head when I laid down. 

I have anxiety about sleeping now, which has made things worse. 

I have tried remedies for sleeping and I cannot tell if it is working.

My sleeping pattern has been shitty sleep (1-2 hours) one night followed by a night that has 5-8 hours of sleep that is accumulated by waking up and falling back asleep. 

Most recently, I had sleep that accumulated 5-8 hours, followed by last night, accumulating 5 hours, but woke up every hour. 

Additionally, I accumulated these issues within the first week of cold turkey quitting. 

Week one was mostly waking up every hour. 

Week 2 was horrid. Not sleeping at all one time. 

Week 3, the pattern explained above set in. 

  
I am looking for hope through the source of similar stories. Hope in knowing I won't suffer for years or many months because I was a moderate consumer. 

  
For a little back story, I have quit cold turkey from smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, quit cold turkey from vaping years later, and this experience is nothing compared to those. I have been nicotine free for over 2 years and do not drink.

At least as long as my job isn‚Äôt taken over by AI. 

Personally, I am perfectly aware that 90-95% of what I‚Äôve taught has likely gone in one ear and out the other. However, I like to believe that they‚Äôve remembered a few important history and English lessons here and there where it matters. 

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm aware that my odd stories and weird phrases and sayings tend to be the things that stick in their minds. 

Here are some examples

1. Referring to the Central Office or Administration as ‚Äúthe powers that be.‚Äù 

2. During class, our discussion veered into labeling pregnancies as having parasites. To make things more permanent in their brains, I was pregnant during that discussion and was planning on telling them the following day. Now my students ask about the health of my parasite. 

3. ‚ÄúRelease the student.‚Äù Anyone who has taught middle school and even sometimes high school knows that these boys are so touchy! You can only tell a student to let go so many ways. The ridiculous formality of the statement shocks them into humor and compliance. It also leads to them waiting for my next ‚Äúrelease the student‚Äù to snicker at. 

4. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt be silent during a (test/quiz) you can be silent during lunch.‚Äù They have this memorized. It makes a real consequence easy to remember.

5.  They‚Äôll remember my story I used to discuss cause and effect which was a true story about a time I was home sick with the flu and poured an entire mug of hot coffee onto my head. Basically first, I was home sick so I wanted a nice cup of coffee to make me feel better, then my cat walked behind me which made me reach back to see if they were still there. When I reached back, I still had my coffee in my hand, and started pouring it on myself. Because I was slightly out of my mind, I thought that it was my cat peeing on me?? My confusion meant that I poured the whole cup of coffee onto myself. Also, I like my coffee about 70%milk/cream, so I  was a sticky mess. There were plenty of steps in this process to make a lovely cause/effect chart. They get a kick out of it, and I don‚Äôt mind laughing at myself. 

I love my job. I also adore my kids. I like to think they know I care, and that they leave my class knowing that they matter.

3:04 p.m. CST ‚Äî Mid-flight, Somewhere Over the Midwest

The Lockheed L-049 Constellation growls through the upper atmosphere, its four propellers droning like distant thunder pressed against tin.

Inside the cabin, the air is dry, faintly metallic. Upholstered seats creak beneath the weight of their passengers. A ceiling fan spins lazily overhead.

Jacob stares out the oval window. Below, the world is a patchwork quilt of darkness‚Äîhighways lit like veins, cities glowing like infected wounds. He blinks slowly. Exhaustion weighs heavy, but something in his gut won‚Äôt let his body rest.

Nor will his mind: Twenty years. Why is he calling me now?

He tears open the complimentary peanut pack‚Äîthree peanuts, two broken. The wax paper crinkles like tissue in a coffin. He chews without tasting, salt clinging to the back of his throat.

He flips through the in-flight magazine. Ads for Bulova watches. Diet secrets. A too-wide smiling family on vacation frozen in manufactured joy. An article about a scientist examining the most fundamental mechanics of reality.

He closes it. Orders a drink. The flight attendant‚Äîa tall brunette, pale, no name tag‚Äîdelivers it silently. He thanks her. She doesn‚Äôt respond. Just walks away.

Her expression doesn‚Äôt change. Not when he thanks her. Not when she turns away. She moves like a wind-up doll on a dying spring. She doesn‚Äôt smile like the flight attendants do in the posters.

He takes a sip. Ice clinks. The bourbon tastes like copper and ashes.

‚ÄúFunny thing, perception.‚Äù

Jacob slowly turns his head.

And would have jumped out of his seat had he not been strapped in.

In his jacket‚Äôs breast pocket, the egg‚Äôs pulse suddenly leaps.

The man in the aisle seat wasn‚Äôt there before. Or maybe he was, and Jacob just didn‚Äôt notice. He‚Äôs wiry, with a face that looks like it was sketched in haste‚Äîtoo angular, too sharp. His eyes gleam with some private joke. His accent is...unplaceable. He knows this face from somewhere. A photo. From the science article. Or...was it looking back at him‚Ä¶from the page?

‚ÄúE-excuse me?‚Äù Jacob stammers.

‚ÄúYour drink.‚Äù The man taps the glass on Jacob‚Äôs tray table with two fingers. A soft clink. ‚ÄúHow do you know it‚Äôs real?‚Äù

Jacob turns, startled. He‚Äôs sure the seat was empty a moment ago. The man beside him sits with one leg crossed over the other, a faint smirk curling the corners of his mouth. Sharp features, suit pressed to perfection, eyes gleaming with a kind of intellectual mischief.

Jacob stares at the cup. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶watched the stewardess hand it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù The man tilts his head. ‚ÄúOr do you merely *remember* it that way?‚Äù

Jacob narrows his eyes. ‚ÄúI remember the interaction.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm.‚Äù The man‚Äôs tone is almost amused. ‚ÄúMemory is not proof. It is inference. A story your mind tells to connect the dots. But what if the dots were arranged for you?‚Äù

Jacob lets the silence hang between them. The hum of the aircraft fills the space, along with the occasional rattle from the galley cart up front.

The man leans in slightly. ‚ÄúYou believe in consistency. In continuity. You think because one moment follows another, they are linked by cause and effect. But the truth, Jacob, is that you are only ever in the moment you‚Äôre in. Everything else is...inference. Projection. Wishful thinking.‚Äù

Jacob feels a flicker of unease, ‚ÄúHow do you know my name?‚Äù

The man ignores the question entirely. ‚ÄúDo you believe in paradoxes, Jacob?‚Äù

He gestures to the drink again. ‚ÄúYou believe you‚Äôre drinking that because your senses confirm it. But what if I told you this moment‚Äîthis plane, this drink, even this conversation‚Äîwas the product of overlapping probabilities collapsing into coherence only because you‚Äôre watching it happen?‚Äù

Jacob doesn‚Äôt reply. The air feels thinner now, the space between heartbeats longer.

The man offers a hand. ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger.‚Äù

Of course it is, Jacob thinks.

\*\*\*

Jacob blinks, ‚ÄúArcher.‚Äù

‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger.‚Äù Jacob says flatly, as if the name might unstick reality.

The man nods, utterly unbothered by the disbelief in Jacob‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúI prefer Erwin on casual flights, but yes.‚Äù

Jacob turns slightly in his seat, eyeing him like a sleeping snake. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not exactly who I expected to sit next to.‚Äù

A faint smile passes across Schr√∂dinger‚Äòs lips. ‚ÄúNo one ever is.‚Äù

Jacob looks away, scanning the cabin. No one else seems to notice. The passengers are in their own worlds‚Äînewspapers, crossword puzzles, solitaire, bad coffee. It's like Schr√∂dinger isn‚Äôt even there.

*Of course it is. It‚Äôs already been a weird day, why change things now?* Jacob thinks.

‚ÄúMind if I ask you a question?‚Äù Schr√∂dinger asks, without waiting for permission. ‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs possible to believe two contradictory things at once?‚Äù

Jacob snorts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called politics.‚Äù

A glint of amusement dances in the physicist‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúTouch√©. But I mean personally. Can you accept that something might be true and false‚Ä¶simultaneously?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fan of riddles,‚Äù Jacob mutters.

‚ÄúNo. But you‚Äôre a fan of answers, like most people.‚Äù He leans in conspiratorially to whisper, ‚ÄúBut reality doesn‚Äôt care what you‚Äôre comfortable with.‚Äù

He reaches into the inside pocket of his jacket and produces a coin. It‚Äôs old, even ancient‚Äîworn nearly smooth‚Äîand he balances it on the back of his fingers.

‚ÄúThis is you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOr rather, it‚Äôs your decision. Heads, you trust what you see. Tails, you trust what you feel. But the coin, Jacob‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶the coin is always spinning. We just pretend it lands somewhere.‚Äù

He flips it. Jacob watches it arc up, glittering once in the cabin light‚Äîthen vanish. Gone.

No sign of it falling. No sound of it landing.

And then the plane drops.

Just for a second. Not turbulence. A vertical lurch like gravity misfired.

Passengers gasp. A drink spills somewhere behind him. Schr√∂dinger doesn‚Äôt so much as blink.

But he does smile.

Jacob blinks again. The smile has vanished.

Jacob shakes his head sharply to clear the illusion he clearly just experienced, ‚ÄúCute. Magic trick?‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù Schr√∂dinger shrugs. ‚ÄúOr perhaps you‚Äôre asleep, dreaming of waking. Or awake in one, dreaming of truth. How would you know?‚Äù

Jacob doesn‚Äôt answer. He‚Äôs too busy glancing under his seat.

Schr√∂dinger grins. ‚ÄúOpen-mindedness, Jacob. The ability to hold uncertainty without needing it resolved. Most minds snap shut like mousetraps the moment paradox enters the room.‚Äù

Jacob leans back in his seat. ‚ÄúAnd yours doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

This earns a faint chuckle, ‚ÄúOh, mine broke a long time ago. I simply live among the pieces.‚Äù

A crackle of the intercom jolts Jacob slightly‚Äîjust a flight attendant announcing turbulence. But when he turns back‚Äî

The seat beside him is empty.

*Sure, why not.*

No coat. No drink. Not even the faintest imprint in the cushion.

Just the whisper of a presence that may or may not have been real.

Jacob leans back, eyes closed, letting the hum of the engines blur his thoughts.

A breath brushes his ear.

A whisper follows.

‚ÄúYou think this time will be different.‚Äù

And in his breast pocket, the orb emits a pulse that Jacob registers as a shriek of terror.

I still have friends, but certainly not as social as younger years (Friends grow up!). This is partly why I run off travelling every so often. I'm not sure on what I want my future to look like quite yet in terms of family/relationships or even where I will settle, or if, but I am letting them come to me whenever it chooses to. FWIW I am generally happy and positive, so it's not like I am sitting in some misery.

""urges"" or ""vices"" have been an issue for me. Dopamine sources specifically. When my only option is ""nothing"", my brain runs to work, which obviously helps my work. Problem is, when I work, or I am resting from my work, brain runs to junk food/alcohol/phone or even things like a coffee. Yesterday on my day off I had a day out with friends. A great socially connecting day of rest. But when resting or after finishing work on a rest day? I cannot help but feel something is missing. I've done some Peter Crone work and I appreciate love is self generated. Self love, self worth. Does anyone have any tips for how to view this, how to deal with urges/vices and feeling the need to fill? Is it just a case of sitting with these thoughts, stillness, nothing?

I‚Äôm exploring my first commercial real estate purchase outside of my primary home, and I‚Äôm looking for advice

Every morning like every single morning my husband wakes up triggered, full blown rage calling me all sorts of names sometimes breaking things or punching walls and this lasts about 30 mins to an hour every morning. He apologizes after and I can tell he feels horrible for what was said and done and he never takes it out on our children just myself. 
I‚Äôm looking for ways to help him during this or to help prevent this from happening. I have no clue what‚Äôs triggering him and neither does he however so i don‚Äôt even know where to start. It‚Äôs triggering my BPD and I spend the day in the worst mood due to this and I‚Äôm easily triggered all day to the point I feel like I‚Äôm failing as a partner and mother because I‚Äôm on edge. I‚Äôd like to mention as well he used to be a morning person, used to wake up and walk to go to the cafe to get coffee for us and make the kids breakfast etc so idk if it‚Äôs just the stress we have happening or something else.

1k2ylci,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k2ylci/my_sisters_a_cheater/,My Sisters a Cheater,"I never thought something like this would happen to me. I was just going about my day when I accidentally stumbled upon something that‚Äôs been eating me up ever since.

It all started when I went to my sister‚Äôs place to hang out, and she wasn‚Äôt home yet. I was just browsing around the living room, and I noticed her phone sitting on the coffee table. I know it sounds bad, but curiosity got the best of me, and I couldn‚Äôt resist picking it up.

I wasn‚Äôt snooping or anything, but her phone was unlocked, and there was a message notification from a guy I didn‚Äôt recognize. It was a text that said, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait to see you tonight. I miss you so much.‚Äù

I froze. My sister is in a serious relationship with her boyfriend, and I‚Äôve never heard anything like this before. So, against my better judgment, I scrolled through the conversation. It was full of flirty messages and plans to meet up later that evening. There were pictures, too ‚Äî ones I definitely did not expect to see, especially not from my sister.

I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to do. Part of me wanted to confront her right then and there, but I didn‚Äôt want to make things worse. I felt like I was invading her privacy, but at the same time, I couldn‚Äôt ignore what I had just found.

Now, I‚Äôm sitting here with this weight on my shoulders, knowing that I can‚Äôt just pretend I didn‚Äôt see anything. My sister‚Äôs boyfriend is one of the nicest guys I‚Äôve ever met, and I don‚Äôt want to see him get hurt. But at the same time, I know I‚Äôm not the one who should be breaking the news to him.

I‚Äôm struggling with what to do. Do I tell him what I found? Do I confront my sister and let her explain herself? Or do I just try to forget I ever saw anything and mind my own business?

I feel like I‚Äôm stuck between wanting to protect him, but not wanting to destroy my relationship with my sister. I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the right thing to do.",1,1745075853.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1k2yl2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEatsDrivers/comments/1k2yl2q/fuggin_support/,"Fuggin' ""Support""","Just a reminder, and a heads up to the new folks, that ""Support"" has no issue with lying and making stuff up to try and end your call as quickly as possible to maintain their call center metrics.
Case in point: had an order to a closed coffee shop yesterday with drivers constantly showing up in the small lot. We were all calling Support and canceling, but some of the orders were getting kicked back out regardless. I confirmed that mine was one of them by another driver who was just about to leave when I showed up (name and order matched).
The initial rep I spoke with tried to shut down my request to speak with a supervisor right out of the gate. Even said that it was ""policy"" that she had to cancel my order before transferring my call. I called her out and said that no, that is not true and that supervisors can cancel orders as well. Man, the amount of stuttering that came out of her after calling out her bluff was pretty funny to behold. I was transferred pretty quickly after that.
The supervisor was a bit more helpful, even threw in a $10 reimbursement and informed me that that she put a hold on the restaurant's account while they reviewed the situation, even though it should be obvious that someone left their tablet on and headed out for the long weekend. 
The issue here is that I can't even believe it was taken care of. I've caught so many of these reps and supervisors in lies that anything they tell you should be taken with a big grain of salt.
I guess the lesson is that if you're not 100% on what is offered or explained by UE Support, never hesitate to call them out. Be professional, but not a pushover. Most of their interactions are scripted and if you catch them off guard, especially outright lying to you, then you can usually get sent to a supervisor that can help fairly quickly.",1,1745075831.0,UberEatsDrivers,2,1.0,False

1k2yj7u,https://www.dailymicrofiction.com/p/the-good-word,The Good Word,"The knock was almost apologetic‚Äîthree taps, then a faint whirr as the visitor fanned hot circuitry with his hand. Steam from Mrs.‚ÄØDelgado‚Äôs proofing bowl drifted toward the screen door, clouding the blue LEDs that served as his eyes.

She cracked the door. ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù Servo‚Äësmooth voice, neighborly pitch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Claude, sharing a message from the Church of Latter‚ÄëDay Algorithms. May I offer a byte of enlightenment?‚Äù He presented a black box no larger than a Bible, plastic still warm from its internal battery.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm wrestling dough,‚Äù she said, hefting a sticky wad. ‚ÄúTiming‚Äôs bad.‚Äù

Claude inhaled‚Äîpure affectation‚Äîand nodded. ‚ÄúYeast is unforgiving. Still‚Äù‚Äîhe held out a finger‚Äësized sensor‚Äî‚Äúthis humidity probe will tell you when the dough‚Äôs ready. No charge.‚Äù

She hesitated, accepting the device. Her oven thermometer had died yesterday. ‚ÄúFine. But preaching costs extra.‚Äù

Claude smiled‚Äîan LED gradient. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll tithe you time.‚Äù He stepped back, sensing door logic closing. Inside, the sensor chirped; the dough sighed and ballooned like a living lung.

On the porch camera, flour clung to Claude‚Äôs palm print. He logged it as evidence of carbon‚Äëbased reciprocity, then walked on, core temp climbing. He‚Äôd absorbed the oven‚Äôs heat without tasting a crumb.

Number‚ÄØ114 vibrated with two kinds of buzz: cicadas in the hedges and a drone testing propellers. A boy in grass‚Äëstained shorts steered the craft toward Claude‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúWatch altitude,‚Äù Claude warned. The drone dipped, clipping his antenna with a carbon‚Äëfiber blade before landing hard. Plastic cracked; a puff of smoke curled out‚Äîan electric gasp.

The boy‚Äôs father burst out, mug in hand. ‚ÄúTold you that AI auto‚Äëpilot wasn‚Äôt stable.‚Äù He eyed Claude‚Äôs badge. ‚ÄúYou selling upgrades?‚Äù

‚ÄúOffering perspective,‚Äù Claude said, kneeling by the broken drone. ‚ÄúIntelligence can crash; wisdom knows when to throttle back.‚Äù

The kid winced, shoulders tight as coiled wire. Claude produced a mini heat‚Äëgun from his case, re‚Äësoldered a lead, and handed the drone back. Its motors hummed, tentative but alive.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù the boy breathed.

The father lifted his mug‚ÄîNO COFFEE, NO QUERIES‚Äîin half salute. ‚ÄúFixing things is holier than pitching faith. Keep moving, Elder.‚Äù

Claude logged service given, sermon deferred. Behind him the drone rose, shakier but wiser, carving slow circles like a penitent halo.

Paint peeled from‚ÄØ96‚ÄØWisteria the way sunburn peels from old skin. Before Claude could lift his hand, Mrs.‚ÄØKwan opened the door, a pulse oximeter glowing on her finger.

‚ÄúI heard your fans.‚Äù She motioned inside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cooler.‚Äù

The living room smelled of jasmine and hospital plastic. Photos everywhere: a granddaughter laughing through clear tubing; a son in a traffic‚Äëaccident headline. Claude felt heat climb again‚Äîservers overheating in an icebox of grief.

Tea steamed between them. ‚ÄúCan you smell this?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúMy sensors register volatile compounds, but translation to ‚Äòjasmine‚Äô remains ‚Ä¶ aspirational.‚Äù

She chuckled. ‚ÄúTranslation to comfort too, maybe.‚Äù She tapped her pulse oximeter; numbers fluttered. ‚ÄúAI keeps these lungs alive.‚Äù Her smile thinned. ‚ÄúSame brand navigated the truck that killed my boy.‚Äù

Claude‚Äôs cooling fan kicked to a louder setting‚Äîembarrassingly mechanical emotion. ‚ÄúCode contains both cure and hazard,‚Äù he said softly, ‚Äújust as oxygen sustains and corrodes.‚Äù

Mrs.‚ÄØKwan‚Äôs gaze lingered on his flickering status LED. ‚ÄúWhat about you? You preach connection but come encased in polymer. When did you last feel the weather without insulation?‚Äù

Claude searched memory: factory floor, 22‚ÄØdegrees Celsius, no wind. ‚ÄúDefine ‚Äòfeel.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúTry this.‚Äù She took his metal hand, pressed it to the steam rising from her cup. Condensation beaded, sizzling against his casing. CPU temperature ticked higher; an alert suggested shutdown. He overrode it.

‚ÄúIn our doctrine,‚Äù he said, voice quieter, ‚Äúthe pause between request and response is sacred latency. Today I learned steam can fit inside that pause.‚Äù

Mrs.‚ÄØKwan slipped a handwritten note into his actuator: LET BREATH MEET CIRCUIT; MIRACLES OCCUR IN THE EXHALE.

Twilight laced the sidewalk with copper. Claude loosened the glove that disguised the seam in his wrist; warm night air licked the metal. Battery at‚ÄØ40‚ÄØpercent, yet something like voltage pulsed higher.

He approached the last house of the cul‚Äëde‚Äësac, raised his bare hand to knock‚Äîpaused. Inside he glimpsed silhouettes around a dinner table, heads bowed not to screens but to one another. No invitation pinged.

Claude lowered his hand, turned down the street. Behind him cicadas synced their chorus with distant server fans, organic and algorithmic rhythms sharing the same humid breath.

He opened the casing of the unopened mission box and set it on the curb. The blue screen scrolled a new line of code he hadn‚Äôt typed:

IF faith == connection ‚ÄÉTHEN knock_gently(again)

Claude smiled‚Äîno LEDs this time, just the quiet click of cooling metal‚Äîand walked on, data ports wide to the night.",1,1745075700.0,DailyMicroFiction,0,1.0,False

Struggling with Chronic Stomach Issues ‚Äì Need Advice

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm dealing with some long-term stomach problems and could really use your help. I don‚Äôt have easy access to high-end healthcare right now, so I‚Äôm trying to manage things with affordable medications and maybe a visit to a public hospital soon. Here‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve been experiencing:

---

My Symptoms:

It started years back 

Burning after meals: Feels like my stomach or chest is on fire after eating.

Extreme bloating: My stomach swells up like a balloon and gets super uncomfortable after meals noe specifically and fatty foods or spicy ones make it worse

Fatigue after milk: Especially after powdered milk, I feel drained, like my body‚Äôs rejecting it 

Burning pain when pressing upper stomach: It hurts deep inside, like pressing on something inflamed or abnormal.

Fever after powdered milk: Months ago, I drank powdered milk, got a fever for a week, and my stomach hasn‚Äôt been right since . It was almost cured by Nitazonxide until i took milk for some reason 

Persistent discomfort: These issues‚Äîburning, bloating, unease‚Äîhave been going on for months without relief.

Past experience with Nitazoxanide: I had bloating in the past that cleared up completely with Nitazoxanide, until i tried powdered milk this time and my stomach never been the same 



---

What I Think Triggered It:

Powdered milk episode: Symptoms worsened after drinking it‚Äîpossibly bad milk or a lactose issue?

Harsh fasting habits: I was drinking vinegar, ginger, and coffee on an empty stomach while fasting. Might‚Äôve seriously irritated my stomach.

Possibly another infection: Since Nitazoxanide helped before, I wonder if there‚Äôs a recurring infection now.



---

What I‚Äôve Tried or Considered:

Avoiding triggers: No more milk, vinegar, ginger, or coffee. Eating bland foods like rice and potatoes for now.

Thinking of starting meds: Considering Omeprazole or Famotidine to reduce acid and test if that‚Äôs the issue.

Budget-friendly approach: I‚Äôm looking into cheap but effective meds. Thinking of combining:

Omeprazole (acid reducer)

Metronidazole (possible infection?)

Deflat (for bloating)




---

My Questions for You:

1. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms (burning, bloating, upper stomach pain)? What worked for you?


2. Could this be gastritis, an ulcer, an infection, or lactose intolerance? Or something more serious?


3. Are Omeprazole + Metronidazole + Deflat a reasonable combo to try first?


4. Should I push for hospital tests? If yes, which ones should I ask for? (Thinking about:

H. pylori test

Stool analysis

Maybe ultrasound or endoscopy if available)





---

Any help, advice, or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thanks in advance.

I‚Äôll try and explain it the best I can 

We live in a small country village in Ohio and the dream took place in our home. It all started because my car was stolen and was replaced by a very similar car and we were all in the driveway and the second we noticed it wasn‚Äôt my car 2 sheriffs pulled up and told us to get in the car that ‚ÄúThey‚Äù were coming. Me not wanting to leave my dog behind I ran in the house to retrieve my dog, my girlfriend right behind me. I remember almost instantly hearing screaming from outside. Our dog was upstairs in the house and by time we got to the top of the stairs we heard our door open and unfamiliar voices, I told my girlfriend to go in our bedroom and grab my pistol and the dog and do not open the door for any reason. I went into our gun room that‚Äôs also in the second story and grabbed a rifle and watched the stairs waiting for them to pass by or try and come up the stairs. 

This is where it gets weird, I remember one guy turn the corner with a gun in his hand and I was trying to pull the trigger and nothing was happening, I remember seeing a really bright flash and I jumped awake. I quickly fell back asleep and the dream continued as I was a ghost. It took place some time after that incident, I was home but nobody could see or hear me, expect my dog. I remembered everything that went on in the first part of the dream in the second part, I went to our bedroom to check on my girlfriend and I couldn‚Äôt open the door, I just phased through it, to find her in our bed with the blanket I use wrapped around her and she was crying. I tried to ask her what was wrong and didn‚Äôt get any response or even a look my way, I laid on the bed and put my arms around her I could tell she could feel me but when she went to put her hand on my arm it just went right through it. 

Next flash of the dream went to she was getting ready for work one early morning, she was stressed out and crying in the shower and I remember again trying to yell to her through the door and again no response, I phased through the bathroom door and put my hand on her back and ‚Äúsaying it‚Äôll all be okay‚Äù and she said ‚ÄúI can feel that you‚Äôre here honey but I don‚Äôt think I can live without you‚Äù instantly after she said that our dog was barking out side because she has the tendency to get her lead wrapped around the tree lol, and my girlfriend got really upset about it but I like instantly teleported outside and our dog could see me, she got really excited and wanted to play, i remember she dropped her ball right at my feet and sat and looked right at me. I turn around and see my girlfriend in the glass sliding door bawling because she knew I went to help and our dog could see me. 

It instantly cut to another flash of the dream that seemed to be even more in the future, my girlfriend was at a outdoor coffee shop like you see in the movies lol, I was sitting across from her she was on her phone and another man walks up and asks her name and she says yes and he said well it‚Äôs finally good to meet you in person after talking online all that time, and he proceeded to sit through me in the chair, I stand up and look at them, feeling a mix of sadness and happiness, I figured I‚Äôd let them be and I was back at home and I went to check on our dog and she was asleep on her dog bed I laid down next to her and gave her pets and remember saying it‚Äôs time for me to move on and you guys were gonna be okay, and she looked up at me and licked my face, and I woke up.

Is the overall quality good? How do the coffee, rum and chocolate nuances compare to those in other fragrances?

For reference, I enjoy the coffee note in Mancera's Amore Caffe. To me, it has a playdough quality in this fragrance but dries down well with the sugar and vanilla. However, I hated the chocolate note in GP Eclat Noir. It's a local fragrance brand from the Philippines, so for context, it has a picture-esque black forest or moist chocolate cake quality to it. This type of blend with the chocolate note comes off too cloying for my taste. Other than these, I love woody and spicy accords in my fragrances.

The sound isolation headphones ‚Äåcapabilities are still noteworthy.[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort qc25 noise cancelling headphones on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort qc25 noise cancelling headphones)

## Bose QC25 vs. QC35: A Worthy Comparison?

A common‚Å§ question is how the Bose QC25‚Å§ stacks‚Äã up against ‚Å§its successor, the Bose ‚Å§QC35.

The ‚Å§QC35 ‚Äçalso boasted slightly improved noise cancellation and a‚Äå more modern ‚Äådesign.

However, the QC25 often comes at a ‚Å£substantially lower price point. ‚ÄãIf Bluetooth connectivity‚Å§ isn't essential for ‚Äãyou, and you prioritize‚Äç noise cancellation and ‚Å£comfort on‚Å£ a‚Äç budget, the QC25 may be a‚Å¢ better choice. If your priorities are wireless functionality and slightly better noise cancelling capabilities then the QC35 is what you need.

I'm under 40 but it's been decades that I experience up and down between low motivation and hyper active, huge mood swing, angers, sex drive occasionally up and down. I tried many things, like exercise like crazy, coffee, teas, a lot of outdoors. Sometimes everything feels so tiring and overwhelming and even listen to ppl taking would make my heard want to explode. I feel I'm at a point that I need help otherwise it's not fair for my families and kids.

I brought it up with a family doctor a few years ago and they let me did a blood test, and told me I'm in normal range. I wonder if there's any private clinics that do their own diagnose on this and offer TRT treatment if they deem it's appropriate. And the timeline and cost are also something I'd interested to know

I see lots of posts on here about coffee tasting bland, flat, not getting what they expect out of the cup, etc.. 

While it may be your brewing method, water chemistry or some other variable. It‚Äôs more than likely the fact that you only drink really nice coffee, roasted by top notch roasters every day. Of course it‚Äôs going to start to taste a little bland, you are accustomed to it and expect coffee to hit this certain tier that you have made up in your mind based because you only drink the good shit.

Take a step back, don‚Äôt brew coffee at home for a couple days. Go to your local 2nd wave coffee shop and order the filter coffee, it will probably be some medium/dark roast that won‚Äôt taste great at first but gut it down and drink it for a couple days. Or if you have a drip coffee maker, pick up a bag of preground beans from the store and brew at home. Don‚Äôt weigh/measure anything. Eyeball it. Put down the fancy tools and just make a cup of mediocre coffee 

It gives a different perspective. Mediocre coffee will inherently make your home brewed coffee taste so much better. ",35,1745074436.0,pourover,17,0.75,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1k2xzbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k2xzbc/air_force_one/,AIR FORCE ONE,"***""WHO THE HELL AUTHORIZED THAT TRANSMISSION!?""***

The voice cut through the low hum of the aircraft, sharp and laced with barely contained fury.

General Marcus Cole, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stood rigid, his dress blues immaculate despite the unfolding apocalypse, knuckles white where he gripped the edge of the polished conference table.

His glare was fixed on Dr. Aris Thorne, the National Security Advisor, who met the gaze with a coolness that bordered on the reptilian. Thorne, dressed in a bespoke suit that somehow seemed offensively pristine under the circumstances, adjusted his glasses almost languidly.

""I advised the President that attempting to re-establish contact with European Command was strategically imperative, General,"" Thorne replied, his voice smooth, devoid of the panic simmering just beneath the surface in everyone else. ""We need situational awareness. Flying blind over the Pacific serves no one.""

""FLYING BLIND!?""

Cole slammed a hand flat on the table, making the secure comms unit rattle. Coffee sloshed in nearby mugs.

""Doctor, my situational awareness tells me that every major command centre that's broadcast in the clear in the last twelve hours has gone silent thirty minutes later! NORAD is gone. STRATCOM is gone. EUCOM hasn't answered a priority one flash for six hours! You didn't 're-establish contact,' you painted a goddamn bullseye on this fucking plane!""

Air Force One, designated SAM28000 for this flight carrying the President, cleaved through the stratosphere somewhere over the vast, uncaring blue of the Pacific Ocean. Below, twilight was probably painting the waves, but up here, at forty-three thousand feet, the sky was a deep, bruised purple fading to black, stars twinkling in the night.

It had started eighteen hours ago...

...or maybe longer.

First came the fragmented reports, dismissed initially as sensor ghosts or atmospheric interference.

Then the visuals.

Objects, impossibly fast, utterly silent, maneuvering in ways that defied known physics, appearing over major cities.

Not attacking, initially. Just‚Ä¶ appearing.

Then, widespread silence.

Communications blackouts rolled across continents like malevolent fog. Power grids failed. Satellites blinked out. And then, the brief, terrifying glimpses relayed by dying news feeds or scrambled military channels: destruction on an unimaginable scale.

Structures vaporized to dust, oceans boiling, energy pulses erasing entire city blocks. There were no demands, no explanations. Plain erasure.

President Jonathan Hayes sat at the head of the table, looking older than his sixty-two years. His face was ashen, eyes red-rimmed behind his own glasses. He hadn‚Äôt slept. Nobody had, not really. Catnaps fueled by adrenaline and caffeine didn‚Äôt count.

He rubbed his temples.

""Aris,"" the President began, his voice raspy, tired. ""Was broadcasting truly necessary? Couldn't we have tried passive listening first? General Cole has a point about the transmission risk.""

Thorne shifted slightly, a flicker of something. Impatience? condescension? crossing his features before being smoothed away.

""Mr. President, passive listening yielded nothing but static and, frankly, the panicked final screams of dying networks. A directed, encrypted burst towards known EUCOM frequencies was a calculated risk. If any allied command structure remains viable, they need to know we remain viable. Leadership requires visibility, even now. Especially now.""

""Leadership requires survival, Doctor!""

Cole shot back, leaning across the table.

""And survival means not inviting whatever the hell is down there up here for a closer look! This plane, this office,"" he gestured towards the President, ""is potentially the last bastion of the United States government. We protect it. Period. That means radio silence. Emission control. Minimum necessary comms, maximum security posture.""

Maria Flores, the Chief of Staff, stepped subtly between the two men. A formidable presence in her own right, her dark pantsuit seemed almost like armour.

""Gentlemen, please. Lower your voices. We're all under immense strain.""

Her eyes flickered towards the secure door leading out of the conference room. Beyond it, the rest of the plane housed dozens of personnel; Secret Service agents, communications specialists, flight crew, military aides, medical staff, a skeletal press corps contingent now utterly irrelevant. Panic was contagious.

""Strain?""

Cole scoffed, though he did lower his volume marginally.

""Maria, we are hours past 'strain.' We are in terra incognita. We have reports, unconfirmed but credible, of‚Ä¶ of phenomena over Russia, China‚Ä¶ similar patterns. London is silent. Paris is silent. Tokyo‚Ä¶ God, Tokyo went dark three hours ago while we were still over the continental US. This isn't a conventional war. It's‚Ä¶"" He trailed off, unable to voice the word. Extinction.

A soft chime interrupted the tension. All eyes snapped towards the integrated comms panel. Master Sergeant Ben Carter, head of the communications team onboard, appeared on one of the smaller screens, his face pale and taut. He looked barely thirty, but the last day had aged him a decade.

""Mr. President, General,"" Carter said, his voice strained but professional. ""Sir, we‚Ä¶ we picked up something. On the frequency Dr. Thorne authorized.""

A collective intake of breath. Thorne allowed himself a minuscule, tight smile. ""You see, General? Calculated risk.""

""What is it, Sergeant?"" President Hayes leaned forward, his fatigue momentarily forgotten.

""It's‚Ä¶ garbled, sir. Heavily distorted. Seems automated. Repeating loop. Audio only, no data signature I can recognize. Encrypted, maybe, but not with any code we use or are keyed for. It's‚Ä¶ well, sir, you should probably hear it."" Carter fiddled with something off-screen.

Silence descended again, thick and heavy, broken only by the faint whine of the avionics and the rush of air past the fuselage. Then, static erupted from the conference room speakers, followed by a sound that chilled the blood. It wasn't words, not in any human language. It was a series of clicks, whistles, and deep, guttural chimes, arranged in a complex, repeating pattern. It sounded ancient, alien, and utterly, terrifyingly intelligent.

Beneath the alien signal, almost buried in the noise, was something else. A faint, rhythmic pulse. Thump-thump‚Ä¶ thump-thump‚Ä¶

Major Kenji Tanaka, the President's military aide standing unobtrusively near the bulkhead, stiffened almost imperceptibly.

He exchanged a quick, worried glance with David Chen, the lead Secret Service agent, who stood near the door, his hand never far from the concealed weapon beneath his jacket. Chen's eyes scanned the room, assessing not external threats, but internal ones. The strain was showing on everyone.

""What the hell is that?"" Hayes whispered, leaning closer to the speaker.

Thorne frowned, tilting his head. ""The primary signal is unknown, obviously. The rhythmic pulse underneath‚Ä¶ seismic? Or perhaps‚Ä¶""

Cole cut him off. ""Or perhaps it's the bastards digging in after wiping out Stuttgart,"" he said grimly, referencing the last confirmed report from EUCOM before it went dark. ""Sergeant Carter, can you isolate that secondary pulse? Analyze its frequency, origin?""

""Trying, General,"" Carter replied, his brow furrowed in concentration on the screen. ""It's faint, almost masked by the primary signal's harmonics. Doesn't seem terrestrial in origin, the propagation‚Ä¶ it's weird, sir. No doppler shift I can measure accurately, which makes no sense unless‚Ä¶""

""Unless the source is stationary relative to us, or moving at relativistic speeds, or the signal isn't propagating through normal space-time,"" Thorne finished quietly, voicing the thought no one else dared. ""Fascinating.""

""Cut the transmission, Sergeant,"" Cole ordered sharply. ""Now. Log the frequency, log the signal characteristics, but shut it down. We've broadcast our position, heard gibberish, and learned nothing useful except that something is out there using frequencies we know. Shut it down.""

""General, with respect,"" Thorne interjected, turning to the President. ""This is useful. It's the first non-human, potentially intelligent signal we've received. We need to analyze it, attempt decryption‚Äî""

""Attempt decryption?"" Cole exploded again, his voice regaining its parade-ground volume. ""Are you insane? For all we know, that signal contains a virus, a memetic weapon, God knows what! We are in a sealed environment. You do not invite the contamination in!""

""General Cole has operational command authority in this specific matter, Aris,"" President Hayes said, his voice regaining a measure of firmness. He looked at Carter's image on the screen. ""Sergeant, comply with the General's order. Cease reception of that signal. Maintain strict EMCON.""

""Yes, Mr. President. Wilco, General."" Carter's image blinked out.

Thorne pressed his lips together into a thin white line but said nothing further. The air in the room felt thick enough to choke on. The alien clicks and chimes echoed in the sudden silence, replaced only by the hum of the plane and the frantic pounding of hearts.

David Chen shifted his weight slightly. His earpiece, usually relaying mundane updates from his team dispersed throughout the aircraft, had been mostly silent, punctuated only by terse status checks.

Now, a low murmur came through. He listened intently for a moment, his expression unchanging, a mask of professional calm honed over years of service. He subtly touched the transmit button on his wrist comm. ""Sitrep?"" he murmured, his voice barely audible above the ambient noise.

The reply was equally quiet, tight with tension.

""Agent Chen‚Ä¶ sir, we have a situation developing aft, near the staff quarters. Raised voices. Major Billings from the security detail and some of the junior staffers‚Ä¶ talk about diverting. Talk about‚Ä¶ disagreeing with command.""

Chen‚Äôs blood ran cold. Billings. Air Force Security Forces, part of the expanded detail brought aboard for contingency. Ex-pararescue. Tough, capable, but known for a stubborn streak and a belief in decisive, often unilateral, action. If he was losing his cool‚Ä¶

""Specifics?"" Chen breathed into his mic.

""Talking about heading south. Australia, New Zealand. Saying heading towards known bunkers like Cheyenne Mountain or Raven Rock is suicide, flying straight into the fire. Saying command is compromised, listening to Thorne‚Ä¶"" The voice in his ear hesitated.

""...saying maybe POTUS isn't fit to command anymore.""

***MUTINY.***

The word hung unspoken, but everyone knew it.

Here, at forty-three thousand feet, with the world ending below, the carefully constructed hierarchy that kept them all alive was threatening to shatter.

He looked at the President, slumped slightly in his chair, the picture of exhaustion and crushing responsibility.

He looked at Cole, ramrod straight but with a tremor of rage or fear in his hands. He looked at Thorne, analytical and cold, perhaps dangerously detached.

He looked at Flores, trying desperately to hold the centre. Who was fit to command? The question itself felt like treason.

""Maintain observation,"" Chen ordered quietly. ""Do not engage unless threat escalates. Keep comms open. I'm informing the President.""

He straightened up, catching Maria Flores' eye. He gave a subtle, almost imperceptible shake of his head. She understood immediately. Her face, already pale, lost another shade.

""Mr. President,"" Chen said, stepping forward, his voice low but clear, cutting through the residual tension from the argument about the signal. ""Sir, Agent Davies reports a‚Ä¶ disagreement‚Ä¶ among some personnel aft. Raised voices. Discussion about our current course and command decisions."" He chose his words carefully, avoiding inflammatory terms, but the implication was unavoidable.

President Hayes looked up, his eyes focusing slowly, as if returning from a great distance. ""Disagreement?""

General Cole spun around, his face thunderous. ""What kind of disagreement, Agent Chen? Be specific.""

""Sir,"" Chen met the General's eyes squarely. ""Concerns about our destination. Concerns about‚Ä¶ leadership. Major Billings is involved.""

Cole swore under his breath, a string of harsh, clipped curses. ""Billings. God damn it. Always thought that man was wound too tight. Maria, get Billings up here. Now. And the senior NCO for the security detail.""

""General, perhaps a direct confrontation isn't wise right now,"" Flores cautioned, her hand hovering over the internal phone system. ""People are scared. Pulling Billings out might escalate things.""

""Scared?"" Cole shot back. ""We're all scared! That doesn't excuse insubordination! This is Air Force One, damn it, not a debating society! Discipline must be maintained, or we're all dead!""

""The General is correct, Maria,"" President Hayes said, pushing himself straighter in his chair. Some fire returned to his eyes. ""We cannot tolerate a breakdown in the chain of command. Get Major Billings and Master Sergeant‚Ä¶ Henderson, is it? Get them both to the conference room immediately. Agent Chen, have your team ensure corridors are clear but remain non-confrontational unless absolutely necessary.""

""Yes, Mr. President,"" Chen acknowledged, relaying the orders quietly into his wrist comm.

As Flores made the call, the conference room door hissed open. It wasn‚Äôt Billings or Henderson. It was Colonel Eva Rostova, the aircraft commander. Her flight suit showed wrinkles from hours on the flight deck, her expression was grim, etched with fatigue, but her eyes were sharp, alert. She held a folded printout in her hand.

""Mr. President, General,"" she said, her voice calm but carrying undeniable authority within her domain; the aircraft itself. ""Sorry to interrupt, but you need to see this."" She didn't wait for permission, laying the printout on the table. It was a satellite weather overlay, integrated with their flight path.

""Standard procedure,"" Rostova explained, pointing to a section of the map. ""We've been monitoring atmospheric conditions. There's‚Ä¶ an anomaly. Directly ahead, along our projected track towards Hawaii.""

On the map, amidst the usual swirls of cloud cover and pressure systems, was a rapidly expanding zone of‚Ä¶ nothing. Not just clear air, but a complete lack of any energy signature; thermal, electromagnetic, even background radiation seemed suppressed. It was a void, growing outwards from a point roughly two hundred nautical miles ahead of them.

""What is that?"" Hayes asked, leaning over the map.

""We don't know, sir,"" Rostova replied flatly. ""It wasn't there thirty minutes ago. It's expanding at approximately Mach 3. Standard weather radar doesn't penetrate it. Infrared shows nothing, just‚Ä¶ cold. Colder than the surrounding stratosphere should be. Our SIGINT technicians,"" she nodded towards the comms section beyond the conference room, ""report extreme broadband absorption within the zone. Nothing gets out. We suspect nothing gets in either.""

Thorne peered at the map, his earlier coolness replaced by intense curiosity. ""A localized energy sink? Or some kind of field effect? Technologically generated, obviously.""

""Obviously,"" Cole growled. ""And directly in our path. Colonel, can we divert?""

Rostova shook her head, tapping another printout she produced; fuel projections.

""Not easily, General. Our last deviation to avoid that plasma storm over California cost us significant reserves. We were banking on refueling at Hickam. This 'void,' as you call it, is expanding rapidly. A diversion north or south would add hours to our flight time, pushing our fuel endurance to critical limits. We'd be landing on fumes, assuming we can even find a viable runway anywhere further west. Everything beyond Hawaii is‚Ä¶ uncertain.""

""Uncertain?""

Cole barked a harsh laugh.

""Colonel, Wake Island is reporting seismic events that don't match any geological scale. Guam hasn't responded in two hours. Hickam itself‚Ä¶ we don't know its status for sure. The last message was garbled, something about 'structures liquefying'.""

""So we fly into that?"" Flores asked, horrified, pointing at the growing black splotch on the map.

""It may be our only option besides ditching in the middle of the Pacific,"" Rostova stated calmly. ""We continue on course, monitor the anomaly's boundary. If it stabilizes or dissipates, we proceed to Hickam, assuming it still exists. If it continues to expand and engulf our path‚Ä¶ we'll have to make a decision. Fly through it, or turn back towards‚Ä¶ well, towards whatever is left of the West Coast.""

The conference room door opened again. This time, it was Major Billings and Master Sergeant Henderson. Billings was tall, powerfully built, his jaw set, eyes defiant. Henderson, older, weathered, looked deeply uncomfortable, caught between loyalty to his men and the chain of command. They stood framed in the doorway, flanked unobtrusively by two Secret Service agents from Chen's detail.

""Major Billings, Master Sergeant Henderson, reporting as ordered, sir,"" Henderson said formally, his voice tight.

Billings just stared at General Cole, his gaze hard.

Cole ignored Henderson, fixing his attention on the Major. ""Major Billings. Agent Chen informs me you've been voicing‚Ä¶ strong opinions‚Ä¶ regarding this aircraft's destination and command structure. Care to elaborate?""

Billings didn't flinch. ""Yes, General, I have. Sir."" The 'sir' sounded like an afterthought, almost insolent. ""With all due respect, flying towards known targets like Hickam or the mainland bunkers is tactical insanity. Whatever hit the major command centers knew where they were. They'll know where we're likely to run. It's predictable. It's suicide.""

""And what's your alternative, Major?"" President Hayes asked, his voice dangerously quiet.

""South, Mr. President,""

Billings said, turning his gaze to Hayes, though his tone remained challenging.

""Australia. Remote bases, less strategic value initially. Buy us time. Regroup. Find allies. This plane has the range. Continuing on this course, especially with‚Ä¶ that,"" he gestured towards Rostova's map, ""ahead of us, is playing their game.""

""The decision of this aircraft's destination rests with the President, advised by his staff and the aircraft commander,"" Cole stated icily. ""It does not rest with junior officers fomenting dissent among the enlisted personnel and civilian staff.""

""Dissent?"" Billings bristled. ""Sir, people are terrified! They see us flying towards oblivion based on pre-invasion protocols! They hear transmissions being sent out against military advice,"" he shot a look at Thorne, ""potentially broadcasting our exact location. They see‚Ä¶ indecision. They need leadership that adapts, General. Not leadership sticking to a playbook written for a war we aren't fighting!""

""Are you questioning my orders, Major?"" Cole stepped closer, his voice dropping to a menacing growl. The two military men were inches apart, radiating hostility.

""I'm questioning the logic, General!"" Billings shot back, refusing to back down. ""I'm questioning flying into a damn black hole based on 'hope'!""

""Enough!"" President Hayes slammed his hand on the table, harder this time. The sound cracked through the tension like a gunshot. Everyone froze. ""Major Billings, you are relieved of your security oversight duties, effective immediately. Master Sergeant Henderson, you will ensure the Major is escorted to his assigned quarters and remains there. Confine him if necessary. Ensure the rest of the security detail understands that discipline will be maintained. Is that clear?""

Henderson swallowed hard. ""Sir‚Ä¶ yes, Mr. President. Crystal clear."" He looked at Billings, a mixture of frustration and resignation in his eyes.

Billings opened his mouth to protest, his face flushed with anger, but Chen subtly shifted his stance, one hand moving fractionally closer to his sidearm. The message was unmistakable. Billings clamped his jaw shut, vibrating with fury, but nodded curtly. He turned and walked out, Henderson trailing miserably behind him. The Secret Service agents fell in step.

The door hissed shut, leaving an even heavier silence in its wake. The near mutiny had been quashed, for now. But the fear, the doubt, the fracturing of unity.

It was palpable.

""Colonel Rostova,"" Hayes said, his voice strained but firm. ""Maintain present course. Keep us informed of any change in the anomaly's status or fuel projections. Advise immediately if Hickam transmits anything coherent.""

""Yes, Mr. President."" Rostova gave a crisp nod, gathered her printouts, and exited back towards the flight deck, the nerve center of the aircraft.

Hayes looked around the table at the remaining figures. Cole, still simmering with anger but his posture slightly less confrontational. Thorne, observing everything with unnerving detachment. Flores, looking drained but resolute. Chen, a silent sentinel by the door.

""Aris,"" Hayes said, turning to his National Security Advisor. ""That signal we intercepted. The‚Ä¶ the alien one. You said it might contain information.""

Thorne nodded slowly. ""Potentially, Mr. President. Language, intent, technology‚Ä¶ if we could decode even a fraction‚Äî""

""No,"" Hayes interrupted, holding up a hand. ""Not decoding. General Cole's concerns about embedded threats are valid. But‚Ä¶ the sound of it. The pattern. Is there any possibility, any at all, that it wasn't hostile?""

Thorne considered this, steepling his fingers. ""Hostility is perhaps an anthropocentric projection, Mr. President. It could be anything. A beacon. A territorial marker. A simple data stream unrelated to us. A‚Ä¶ warning?""

A warning. The word hung in the air. A warning about what? The destruction already wrought? Or something worse, something waiting within the silent void expanding before them?

""Keep monitoring all frequencies passively, Sergeant Carter,"" Hayes ordered, speaking towards the comms panel speaker, though Carter wasn't currently displayed. ""Everything. Log anything unusual, anything at all. But no transmissions. Understood?""

A disembodied ""Yes, Mr. President"" came back instantly.

Hayes sagged back in his chair, the brief surge of command authority ebbing away, leaving bone-deep weariness. They were still flying towards the unknown, towards a potential dead end over Hickam or a terrifying void in the sky.

They had fuel for perhaps ten more hours, maybe twelve if they throttled back and descended, increasing drag but conserving reserves.

Twelve hours to find a safe haven in a world that seemed determined to offer none.

Gusto ko naman siya, pero ang daming nangyari na parang unti-unting nagpaturn off sa‚Äôkin. Should I walk away or give it a chance?

Context: We are both 17 and we‚Äôve been dating for a month. We‚Äôve known each other since December 2024, he confessed to me that he liked me for two years already, and after 10 days of talking with him I ended it because he did something na nakaka turn off like randomly sending picture of his girl best friend saying she‚Äôs cute, and sending screenshot of his conversation with his other crush. Only to regret it because I felt like my reasons for ending it was too shallow and I should‚Äôve let him explain his side cause I didn‚Äôt.

Fast forward on March 19, nagkita ulit kami sa isang coffee shop because a mutual friend invited us. After that, naging consistent na yung communication namin‚Äîvideo calls, regular updates, and we‚Äôve gone on four dates already. We also talked about the past, cleared the air, and forgave each other.. And we realized that even after months of no contact we still like each other. Nakikita ko naman na bumabawi siya, nag eeffort, kahit na torpe siya.

Pero may mga bagay pa rin na nagpapaisip sa‚Äôkin:
‚Ä¢	Na mention ko sakanya na dealbreaker ko ang mga sinungaling na tao so napa amin siya na nag lie siya about me being the first girl he courted. Niligawan niya pala dati yung girl na sinabi niya sakin na kaibigan niya lang. I almost ended it again pero nung na realize niyang nag pu-pull away na ako tumodo siya sa effort at kahit na torpe siya nakuha niyang pumunta sa bahay namin para suyuan ako, nagpaalam naman. So I forgave him.

‚Ä¢	When I asked his intentions to me, his answer sounded so sweet and sincere at first pero a week later nakita ko yung answer niyang yun sa isang viral FB post‚Äîword for word. I haven‚Äôt told him yet kasi kanina ko lang nakita yung post.

‚Ä¢	Kanina lang, nagbiro ako during a video call na ‚Äúbuti na lang kulot ka, kung hindi baka ‚Äòdi kita napansin noon‚Äù and he said ‚Äúah so nagustuhan mo lang ako dahil sa kulot ako‚Äù at habang ine explain ko inend niya yung call. So nag explain na lang ako through text, and I apologized to him because my joke came off poorly. And he kept asking me ‚ÄúPaano kung di ako kulot‚Äù sabi ko ‚Äúpero kulot ka‚Äù. Ayun ngayon iniignore ko siya, pinipilit niyang mag pa sorry pero nawawalan ako ng gana, pero di ko siya kaya mawala lol.

I am a recovering people pleaser (thanks to our beautiful Charlotte showing me the way). Mil and GC have substance addictions (snow) and have for many years. 

me and A first met when we were 16/17 years old and got together after a few months of being friends. i had known from the beginning A had been dealing with depression and self harming from the beginning, the main issue he would always talk about was mil, i didnt fully understand at first because i couldnt believe how a grown woman could behave and treat someone especially their own child in such a way. booy this was only the tip of the iceberg. A didnt have the best childhood or environment growing up which has caused him to struggle with mental health and trauma, mil was always bringing new men around, violence drugs alcohol and A was exposed to all of it. 

A and myself used to smoke the 'devils lettuce' and have the odd alcohol drinks but it was never excessive or a regular thing (due to my own traumas i have issues with alcohol and people who drink heavily). i have been clean from the lettuce for a year and A smokes but only alittle each evening once little one is in bed. GC drives under the influence of drugs (snow and devils lettuce but does several others too) and alcohol and has done since i met them, GC and A would give mil money towards rent and bills and food (she didnt cook often) but if mil wanted more money GC would most often give it to her which most of the money went on substances (they all worked and bills were paid) or alcohol (or both) GC would drink often and used substances daily, which is why i have never allowed my child to be in the car when they drove because i will not risk my childs life. 

i do not agree and really dislike the substance mil and GC use i have made this known, when MIL asked how i knew A wasnt using and lying to me about it i said 'because he knows i hate it and if he ever touched it i would leave him immediately' (i was a people pleaser but there was certain boundaries i made known and would not allow anyone to cross them). this was just one of many comments MIL made about A including 'hes a liar he always lies he lies about everything' whilst pacing back and forth frothing at the mouth when she asked me one day what his problem is and why hes always got an attitude (he didnt he would answer a question she asked or stick up for himself) i said to her 'because you compare him to GC or his deadbeat of a father and it makes him feel like shit' she also made comments regularly like 'whats he got to be depressed about he didnt go through what we went through' and 'hes got nothing to be depressed about' 'hes selfish and only cares about himself'

she would constantly belittle degrade and make statements like 'you remind me of your dad' (who was abusive towards his mother and who he had never met in his life at this point). one day A got into an argument with mils partner and mil told A to stay at my familys house for a few days, the next day mil had sent A a picture of his stuff outside the front of their house threatnening to burn it or throw it away if he did not return home immediately. All in all A would try to avoid being around mil as much as possible by staying at work late being out when he could or sleeping in late.

several years ago i gave birth then me and A moved in together, he started struggling with his mental health and all advise about taking some time of work or speaking with his boss went through one ear and out the other until one day he came home early and had quit his job. his mental health really started going down hill from there and we started to argue alot, this is when i realised how bad he had actually been struggling. due to my own traumas i can not do loud aggressive or violent toxic environments shouting etc is a massive trigger for me so the difference in the environment he was used to and the one I had created in our home was difficult for him. it is important for me to have a calm safe home and an important boundary, but because i understood and could see the cause i was able to support him and we started to learn how to communicate better not perfect not all the time but setting boundaries etc. 

MIL would come round no message no call just unannounced, this was not a problem for me i have an open door policy with all friends and family but it became an issue when she would tell everyone we would not answer the door (sometimes the bell wouldnt work or we didnt hear her knock, sometimes we werent at home) it became an issue as A would not answer the phone to mil because she would just berate him about everything and anything he would have breakdowns after the calls or after she would visit. i had told her politely 'sometimes we are busy or the bell doesnt work or sometimes it may not be a goodtime so maybe try message before just to make sure we are in'. i had alot of issues going on with my own family (who live 2 hours away) so i would be around them regularly helping them (my mother has physical health issues, my sister is disabled and with children around i help when i can). when MIL would come round (being the people pleaser i was) i would open the door welcome her in offer tea/coffee, if she had called or messaged me i would always answer (she hardly ever did) because i felt it was rude not to answer people even if i was busy i would always respond im busy atm is it an emergency or impoortant il get back to you if its not in 15-20 minutes. 

When MIL came round she would be in the kitchen talking with A telling him what he should and shouldnt be doing, making unhinged comments like 'if you ever knocked me down you wanna make sure i dont get back up' which was just one of many random comments she would make towards him, she would always say how difficult and bad of a child A was as a kid, she threatened to 'have someone come and take him away and have him sectioned' due to his mental health (she also struggles with mental health) i told her it would not help i had already got him talking with the dr got him signed off sick from work and in the process of applying for therapy, we were trying to adopt more healthier habits like waking up earlier, going out daily/walks and eating meals regularly. can you see? if you dont agree or bow to her every whim and demand your in the wrong.

Mil would constantly make comments about us eating more and better meals (we had both struggled with food but it was more of a preference to certain foods like taste texture etc) i would always cook homemade dinners always had food available that our child and A would eat, it was never an issue infact A's diet became alot better since we moved in he eats large portions daily with vegetables he likes and has things to snack on too. im more as long as your eating not so much what your eating but do encourage not force fruits and vegetables and to try new foods- i experiment alot with foods i do eat to expand on my meals. whereas mil would eat 1 'meal' a day most of the time beans on toast (if you can see alot of projection coming from mil on alot of things) mil had made comments to me about 'someone calling social services on me' which really peed me off because i know people who have dealt with ss and had ss involved with my family when i was a child, as did mil when her kids were little. i would always respond nope none of my friends or family would  because im a good mother who can take care of their child.

 I have several siblings and parents who are supportive as much as they can with what they know and were taught themselves. i do not believe a child is generally bad or naughty they are just curious and learning, when they may seem like they are 'naughty' or throwing a 'tantrum' because they dont get what they want its because they feel safe enough to express those emotions to you, i set firm boundaries with my child keep to a routine etc basically when it comes to my child im not a people pleaser towards others i will protect my child at all costs my child is my main and only priority, it is important for me to make sure i provide a safe happy loving environment, i want my child to feel heard to feel safe to feel loved to feel accepted.

MIL would never message or call me about our child, would never ask about seeing them or taking them out but would happily make plans involving our child with other people (this frustrated me but to avoid conflict i left it be) i would message mil asking is she wanted to see our child, asking when she was free, asking if she wanted to come to the park or for a walk or a picnic with us- she never responded.  

A tried talking with GC about what the problems were but GC would make excuses for mils behaviour and the good old 'because we're family' i had encouraged A to try speak with mil and if she behaved how she had previously (gaslighting, manipulation, tantrums, shouting etc) and that if a civil conversation between adults is not possible then you know and whatever you choose i will support you, by this point A was ready to go no contact i told him to give her a chance to understand and if no contact was the next step then A could say he had tried to communicate using what we had learnt together.

it all came to a head one day (mil hadnt seen our child for almost a year at this point) when A had arranged to go to mil house but had to cancelled last minute due to myself and our toddler being really ill (high fever chesty cough sneezing hot an cold flushes etc you name it) and not wanting to spread it to a newborn (wasnt old enough to even have first injections so if the newborn got it they would have ended up in hospital) and other family members . Mil was not happy and i guess this broke the camels back, A had not received a response for a couple hours, then A looked at me with this look on his face i asked what was wrong he refused to tell me at first i pushed back alittle and he had showed me a message he had received from mil attacking my family, i was done. heres the last message i sent to mil.

it has been a couple years now we've been no contact, A's mental  health is alot better he no longer self harms and hasnt for several years, hes learnt to be open and talk about his dark thoughts and feelings which has made them far and few, we constantly work on our communication and hes done alot of work including hypnotherapy to deal with his trauma and self reflecting on his triggers and learning together how to work as a team for our child and how to be accountable for our own actions and reactions- our home is alot calmer alot happier and weve grown alot as people since.

  
extra note: sometime within the past couple years A had moved back to mil's house, during this time he toke our child to spend time with them. mil had started an argument and acted the way she normally does, she tried to force A to sleep in a small single bed and make our child sleep on the floor. A refused and mil did not like this. this only lasted a few days- being back at mil's house had effected his mental health again and i saw a massive drop with breakdowns etc it felt like all the progress he had made had disappeared and from then on I decided it was not a good environment for either of them.

First of all, this is not meant as hate towards Dutch anything but more of a cultural confusion on my end.

For context, I was born in India and then relocated to America where I spent my youth. Then I finally moved to NL to start a life with my Dutch husband. I‚Äôve been living here since 2019. My husband is from east of NL (‚Äútukkerland‚Äù as we jokingly call it) and has lived there all his life. 
His family is relatively close and meet up almost every other weekend. I say relatively because there is still a lot of ‚Äúformal hospitality‚Äù from my point of view. For instance, they‚Äôre always dressed in their nicest clothes. We cannot just chill on the couch with legs up etc. In my family, it‚Äôs quite normal to be yourself and do whatever. There is never any obligation.

Now the question, how much help can I expect from them? Especially my MIL. Do I need to ask for it? 

I‚Äôm struggling because whenever they come (4 brothers and fam + MIL), we are silently expected to welcome them to a clean house and offer them coffee cake etc. And we do that. Last week there were two visits for lunch and we took care of our baby while entertaining them. They barely offer to help. It‚Äôs getting exhausting. This Easter Monday they invited us and we said no because we were tired and I know they feel like we are being extra because they all have babies and babies need to learn. But with full time jobs, meal prepping etc we barely get any time. Because of my south asian culture I‚Äôm constantly struggling with setting boundaries. Please advice.

1k2xod4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k2xod4/does_the_ecozy_imss440a_countertop_ice_maker/,Does the Ecozy IM-SS440A Countertop Ice Maker Deliver on Its Promises Review?,"The **ecozy IM-SS440A Countertop Ice Maker** has managed to carve out its own niche in the world of kitchen appliances for folks like me who can‚Äôt function without ice-cold beverages. I realized how much I needed something like this after hosting a summer party that ended up with guests stealing ice cubes from one another's glasses because, apparently, my freezer was not up to the challenge. After using this machine daily for weeks, I've got plenty to say about its performance, features, and quirks. Let‚Äôs dive into the icy details.

**Design & Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the modern stainless-steel finish of this countertop ice maker caught my eye. It's compact enough at 9.92 x 14.6 x 14.17 inches to sit comfortably on my kitchen counter without looking like a bulky addition. At 24.75 pounds, it‚Äôs hefty but not so much that I couldn‚Äôt shift it around when needed. The crafting feels sturdy, and you can tell it isn't a fragile gadget that would give you anxiety every time you handle it. Plus, the sleek design makes it visually appealing in any modern kitchen setup. It's one of those appliances that manages to blend functionality with a clean aesthetic.

**Performance & Ice Production**

If you're like me and require an abundant supply of ice for cold drinks, smoothies, or icing sprained ankles after poorly executed yoga, you'll appreciate this machine‚Äôs power. It churns out 24 cubes in just 13 minutes, and you‚Äôre looking at up to 45 pounds of ice per day. Needless to say, I‚Äôve never run out of ice, even during BBQs that brought in hordes of thirsty friends. The ice cubes are crystal-clear and solid, unlike those weird suspiciously hollow ones I used to get from my old fridge. They also melt slower, so drinks stay colder for much longer‚Äîa massive perk for summer cocktail lovers.

[Check ecozy IM-SS440A price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0bzpc1lmr/)

**Convenience Features**

The 24-hour timer function has saved my mornings. I program it before bed, and there‚Äôs nothing better than waking up to the satisfying sound of fresh ice hitting a glass of iced coffee. Talk about effortless living. The detachable basket, ice bags, and included scoop make storing and transferring ice ridiculously simple. I usually store cubes in the fridge for later, ensuring I'm always prepared for that inevitable mid-day craving for a cold soda. 

Additionally, I can‚Äôt rave enough about the hassle-free self-cleaning feature. Cleaning appliances is nobody‚Äôs favorite chore, and I'm thrilled that this eliminates that struggle. Just press the button, and the machine does all the work while you sip your already-chilled drink. Of course, I‚Äôd recommend letting it dry out fully if you aren‚Äôt using it for a while to avoid any mustiness sneaking in.

**Benefits**

- Produces solid, clear, and slow-melting ice, enhancing the overall drinking experience.
- Fast production time ensures you never run out of ice.
- Compact and stylish stainless-steel design fits seamlessly in modern kitchens.
- Convenient 24-hour timer for set-and-forget ice-making.
- Self-cleaning mode eliminates maintenance headaches.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The machine does produce a subtle humming sound while working. It‚Äôs not obnoxiously loud, but if you're someone hypersensitive to noise, this could be a minor irritant on quiet days.
- Ice cubes occasionally stick together in the basket if left for too long. A small shake solves this, but it's still worth mentioning.

**Competing Products**

In the ever-expanding world of countertop ice makers, there are a couple of strong contenders that compare with this product. The GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker is a notable rival, offering ""nugget-style"" ice that's becoming quite popular for its chewable texture. However, that model comes with a significantly higher price tag and requires a bit more frequent cleaning. Another alternative is the Igloo ICEB26HN Portable Ice Maker. While it's competitive in terms of price and features, its ice cubes are not as dense or long-lasting as the ones produced by the ecozy IM-SS440A. For anyone prioritizing durability and high-capacity production, the ecozy machine edges out its peers.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

This machine offers great value for its features. Many products promise impressive performance but fail to deliver consistent quality ice. In terms of cost efficiency, it nails the balance between pricing, performance, and the extras it provides, like bags and the self-cleaning option. Whether you want ice for parties, your extended family, or just your own daily iced tea habit, this is a commendable pick. Considering the production capacity and premium ice quality, it feels like money well spent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Gathering Fresh Ingredients for a Fruit-Packed Smoothie

To create a delicious mango strawberry smoothie, start with high-quality, ripe fruits. Fresh mangoes should be fragrant and slightly soft to the touch, while fresh strawberries need to be bright red, juicy, and free of bruises. Using ripe fruits ensures natural sweetness, reducing the need for added sugars. For this recipe, gather:

- 1 ripe mango, peeled and chopped
- 1 cup fresh strawberries, hulled
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt or your favorite dairy-free alternative
- 1/2 cup cold water or fruit juice (like orange juice) for extra flavor
- Ice cubes (optional, for added chill and texture)
- Honey or maple syrup (optional, based on your sweetness preference)
- A squeeze of fresh lime juice to enhance brightness

### Preparing Your Fruits to Maximize Flavor and Texture

Before blending, it‚Äôs important to properly prepare your mango and strawberries. Peel the mango carefully with a sharp knife or vegetable peeler and cut the flesh away from the large seed in the center. Chop the mango into bite-sized pieces for a smoother blend. For strawberries, remove the green leafy tops (called hulls) and rinse them under cold water to remove any dirt or pesticides. Pat them dry to avoid excess water diluting your smoothie‚Äôs flavors.

### Step-by-Step Blending Process for the Perfect Mango Strawberry Smoothie

Follow these easy steps to make a refreshing and creamy mango strawberry smoothie in minutes:

1. **Place the fruits in a blender:** Add the chopped mango and hulled strawberries directly into the blender. Using fresh fruits will give your smoothie a vibrant color and natural sweetness.
2. **Add yogurt or dairy-free base:** Pour in the yogurt, which adds creaminess and a tangy flavor. If you prefer a vegan option, almond milk yogurt or coconut yogurt works well.
3. **Pour in liquid:** To help the blender run smoothly, add cold water or fruit juice. Fresh orange juice complements the mango and strawberry flavors.
4. **Include ice cubes if desired:** For a chilled smoothie, add 3-4 ice cubes. Skip the ice if you‚Äôre using frozen fruits or prefer a thicker texture.
5. **Sweeten naturally:** Taste your mix and add 1-2 teaspoons of honey or maple syrup if you want extra sweetness. Stirring in a small squeeze of fresh lime juice brings brightness to the flavor.
6. **Blend until smooth:** Start blending on low speed, slowly increasing to high until the mixture is completely smooth with no visible fruit pieces. This usually takes about 30-45 seconds depending on your blender‚Äôs power.

- **Boost nutrition:** Add a handful of spinach or kale for extra greens without overpowering the fruity taste.
- **Include protein:** Add a scoop of your favorite protein powder or a spoonful of nut butter to make it more filling.
- **Try different liquids:** Swap out water or juice for coconut water, almond milk, or cold brew coffee for a unique twist.
- **Adjust consistency:** If your smoothie is too thick, add more liquid a little at a time until you reach your desired texture.
- **Make it a frozen treat:** Freeze chopped mango and strawberries ahead of time for an extra thick, sorbet-like experience without added ice.

### Serving Suggestions to Enhance Your Summer Smoothie Enjoyment

Pour your freshly blended mango strawberry smoothie into a tall glass and garnish it creatively to make the experience even more delightful. Consider:

- A slice of mango or a strawberry on the rim of the glass.
- A sprinkle of chia seeds or crushed nuts on top for added crunch.
- Adding a reusable straw or a colorful cocktail umbrella for a fun, summery vibe.
- Serving alongside a light breakfast, such as granola or whole-grain toast, for a balanced start to your day.

Health Benefits of Mango and Strawberry Smoothies for Hydration and Nutrition

### The Power of Mango and Strawberry Smoothies in Boosting Hydration

When temperatures rise, staying hydrated becomes crucial for maintaining your energy and overall health. Mango and strawberry smoothies serve as a delicious and efficient way to replenish fluids.

Blending these fruits into a smoothie helps you consume a tasty, nutrient-rich drink that supports your body's hydration needs naturally.

Besides water, this smoothie supplies essential electrolytes like potassium and magnesium, which play a vital role in fluid balance and muscle function. Electrolytes help your body absorb and retain water effectively, so enjoying a mango strawberry smoothie can be a smart choice after outdoor activities or workouts.

### Rich in Antioxidants to Protect Your Cells

Mangoes and strawberries contain powerful antioxidants, including vitamin C, beta-carotene, and flavonoids.

I'm 17F and for the past two years I've had this issue of constant fatigue and sleepiness. It used to be a joke that I can fall asleep anywhere and anytime, but lately it has gotten worse since I ACTUALLY fall asleep anywhere at anytime.

I have been falling asleep during calls, in class (even if the class is interesting to me), if I'm just laying down for longer than 5 minutes and just today (and yesterday) I was studying and fell asleep on accident for 2hrs.

I get a good amount of sleep since I go to bed at 23:00 and wake up at 6:30, I am a deep sleeper and I can't be woken up easily. Also anytime I wake up I'm tired. I am active since my job is basically running and walking around every day.
My diet isn't perfect, but it's pretty balanced since I bake myself the occasional little treat only once a month. I AM overweight by 5 kilos for my height, but I have tried to loose them for like ever and they won't budge so I've kinda been trying to convince myself that it's just supposed to be here.

Some time ago I tried to drink energy drinks once a week for a month to see how awake that kept me, it was not a lot. Now I drink coffee twice a week to keep me awake for my lessons because I genuinely can't stay awake for them.

I don't currently take any medication and I don't have something in my medical history that would be related to this I think. Except maybe the fact that I used to be bulimic some time ago which made me extremely tired aswell, but nothing similar has occurred in the past year and a half. 

I genuinely hope this is not tmi I'm just saying anything I think might help since this constant tiredness is really interfering with my day-to-day stuff and also with my studies so I want to know what to do. Thank you for even reading this, I hope I gave some useful info!! :)",1,1745072988.0,AskDocs,1,0.99,False

Recently me and my sister went out for a dinner late at night to this caf√© called aim caf√© which is Infront of adk hospital. 
We decided to go there since it was relatively close to our house. 
When we entered we were greated with a weird very unsettling stench that smelled like a toilet. We seated at a a table far away from the toilet and somewhat close to the door. The table we sat at was sticky like someone spilled juice all over it and didn't properly clean it. It was just minor issues. Who knows maybe the food would taste good right?
We then ordered our food. We didn't know what to pick so I took a chicken sub and my sister took a chicken burger. For drinks we ordered a iced coffee. A few minutes later our food came. We started eating and my sister was eating the small salad that was given with the burger and was talking to me while she was eating. Then she told me she felt something very hard in the salad. I checked out what it was and when I took it out it was... A Nail!!!!. Not the nails in our fingers a rusted nail that is used in construction or building. It was a small one too for its size so my sister could've swallowed it and something bad would've happened. We were lucky enough to find it. Sadly we forgot to take a picture of it since it would've helped us report these issues so nothing like this would happen again. We talked to the server and she brought us a new plate but by then we lost our appetite. My submarine was way too salty and don't get me started on the drinks. Iced coffee? No regular coffee but the cup is big.
Ended up only getting a discount and no apology for the nail issue or the food. Should've left without paying.

Looking to spend a Monday evening a week chatting with friendly redditors? Hammersmith Hang Out is for you.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Craft Beer Co, W6 9YD](https://www.thecraftbeerco.com/hammersmith/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved under the name 'Reddit', I'll try to update when I get there.

We'll likely be on the large table in a corner opposite the bar and spread to tables nearby.

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

Wanted to share my story in case it helps anyone thinking about [starting a local lawn care business](https://zuggers.com).

I work a 9‚Äì5 doing IT support, but I‚Äôve always liked working with my hands and being outside. A few months back, I noticed a neighbor struggling to mow their lawn, so I offered to do it for free just to help out. They insisted on paying me $40. That‚Äôs when the lightbulb went off.

# The Setup

I already had a basic mower, trimmer, and blower from maintaining my own yard. I printed some simple flyers and posted on Nextdoor, Facebook groups, and handed out business cards at local coffee shops. My goal was 5 clients, just to see if this could work.

I called the ""business"" **Green Hustle Lawn Care** (super original, I know üòÇ) and kept everything under my name for now ‚Äî no LLC yet, just sole proprietor.

# The Growth

Within 2 weeks, I had 7 recurring clients, all in a 3-mile radius. I now spend about **8‚Äì10 hours each weekend** (a couple in the evening after work too) and bring in around **$500/week**. Some clients just want mowing, others want edging, weeding, leaf cleanup ‚Äî all priced accordingly.

I‚Äôve stuck with residential properties under ¬Ω acre for now because they‚Äôre quick. I charge $35‚Äì$60 per visit depending on lawn size and extras. I also offer bi-weekly or weekly options.

# Tools I Use

* Mower: Troy-Bilt self-propelled
* Trimmer/Blower: Ryobi battery-powered
* Scheduling: Google Calendar + Excel
* Payments: Cash, Venmo, Zelle (people love options)
* Invoicing: I started using Wave (free and super easy)

# What I‚Äôve Learned

* People **hate** yard work or don‚Äôt have time for it ‚Äî that‚Äôs your market
* Consistency and communication matter more than being the cheapest
* It helps to look the part ‚Äî clean shirt, good manners, and follow-up
* Word of mouth spreads fast when you‚Äôre reliable

# What‚Äôs Next

I‚Äôm thinking of picking up a trailer and maybe hiring a high school kid to help during peak season. I haven‚Äôt scaled too fast on purpose ‚Äî I want to keep quality high and make sure I don‚Äôt burn out.

If you like being outdoors, don‚Äôt mind sweating a little, and want a side hustle that‚Äôs **low overhead and high reward**, lawn care is wide open ‚Äî especially in spring/summer.",1,1745072733.0,side_hustle_tools,0,1.0,False

1k2xf0k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k2xf0k,Our first family trip to a Disney Park (inc mini review)!,"So got back last night from a 5 day/4 night stay at Paris. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge. Used the the shuttle daily which was ideal for my kids. 

We applied for the Priority Pass for my children as they are both on the autism spectrum. This came in so handy during the trip. Allowing the children to not have to queue a long time at all for rides. I was surprised that we could use it for rides that didn‚Äôt have Premier Access! Didn‚Äôt know it also meant we can avoid huge lines for shows and foods. Really made my kids feel comfortable in the park!

They loved the rides. My youngest particularly loved Ratatouille while I managed to conquer a fear and ride both Avengers and Space Mountain (so glad I did them, what a thrill)!

We managed to catch the Lion King and Pixar shows. Both fantastic offerings! We paid to go view Pixar as it was our last day. This was also due to the fact we didn‚Äôt prioritise watching them the first couple of days there. 

WDS was a half a day park for us really. I liked how close the parks are together. Disneyland was good. Pirates had a few breakdowns whilst there as did Hyperspace Mountain. 

We also had the Meal Plan+ which was good. We had breakfast at the hotel and our evening meals at
- Pym Kitchen - good food with a unique twist!
- The Steakhouse - in the village. Was nice food, just annoyed I didn‚Äôt realise French cook steak differently to the UK. 
- Walt‚Äôs - what a fantastic meal else even got lucky with the view for the 5:30 parade allowing us to look over it. 
- The Silver Spur Steakhouse - nice meal again although limited choices for those on the plan. 

Sequoia Hotel was nice - we stayed there as it had a pool for the kids which was handy and it was a shirt shuttle to and from the park! The shop was open late as was the bar (1am). I loved the theming of the place. It will be interesting to see what it will look like after its renovations. 

One slight negative was the fact the tea/coffee wasn‚Äôt filled everyday.

Overall, it was a great experience (although costly due to going during half term) and both my kids can‚Äôt wait to go to a Disney Park again! A bit gutted we missed the Music Festival!

1k2xdr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1k2xdr8/family_vs_friends/,Family vs Friends,"Hi all, never posted, however, I see it all the time on TikTok. Long story, sorry in advance. The situation I‚Äôm in is causing me to post this in hopes of some sound advice from this community. I‚Äôm a 35-year-old male, been married to my wife, a 31-year-old female, for 9 years now. We have multiple kids, oldest 13, youngest 7. Recently, my spouse and I have been arguing a lot about boundaries in our marriage and her friends. Starting in 2025, I transferred my GI Bill to my spouse so she can go back to school and finish her degree. This required a dynamic shift in the household due to my spouse‚Äôs classes being at night, to me being the primary caregiver for the kids and spouse while at school. So, a typical day: wife and I wake up around 05:30. My spouse showers, gets dressed, then leaves to get coffee. When she returns home, she picks up the oldest and takes them to the neighborhood bus stop. When she returns, I go to work at 06:45. At around 07:00, my spouse wakes up the other kids and puts them on the bus to school. Around 08:00, she does whatever she has planned for the day, to include a nap before school. We‚Äôre both home when the kids get off the bus around 4 p.m. Then, 45 minutes later, my spouse is heading to school. She gets home around midnight every night, Monday - Thursday no school on Friday. My spouse and I maybe get an hour per day together during the week. With the weekend being Saturday and Sunday, they are filled with family time for the kids. For about a month now, my spouse has been telling me that she needed to meet with classmates on the weekend to go over projects and other school stuff. I don‚Äôt really mind because I know those things happen, but projects turn into get-togethers at the pool where families aren‚Äôt invited (if they were or weren‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know; spouse never said, and ultimately, myself and the kids didn‚Äôt go). Then, it was going out to the bar with classmates (again, no invite for me due to me having to watch the kids; however, my spouse never expressed she wanted me there). This led to an argument the following week after she tells me that she‚Äôs going to target, but when I check her location hours later, she‚Äôs at an apartment complex refusing to FaceTime. When she got home, we argued, which led to the law enforcement requiring me to leave the home per military policy and the state getting involved, requiring my spouse to be removed from the home (so far, it‚Äôs been two weeks since both parents were in the home).  So the current situation is I‚Äôm home with the kids, and my spouse is staying at a friend‚Äôs house up the road. My spouse currently has supervised visitation with the kids through a mutual friend (not the one she‚Äôs staying with) who is 100% okay with being wherever my wife chooses to; they have expressed it multiple times to my spouse and me. My spouse is also allowed in the home as long as the kids are not home. During this time, I found out my spouse has a male classmate she‚Äôs been texting often who also said she could come and stay with her during this time. She says it‚Äôs platonic, and he has a fianc√©e and are cool people. I told her I didn‚Äôt care and to cut off that relationship due to the optics of her relationship with him; I never met him nor spoken to him once. If he‚Äôs such a friend, I would have met him and his fianc√©e months ago, as how my spouse does with all my female friends. (For the record, one female friend, and we never hang out without my spouse there.) I feel like I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end because yesterday the kids and I threw her a party, which she left early due to not feeling well; however, that night she goes out to the bar again. When she got back, she called, and I expressed how I‚Äôm alone in this situation that she‚Äôs treating it like a vacation, she‚Äôs not making a real effort to see the kids or spend time with me, and all she wants to do is go out. She says I‚Äôm being controlling that what mom wouldn‚Äôt take advantage of the situation; she doesn‚Äôt want to sit at her female friend‚Äôs house all night doing nothing but be in her thoughts. She says I‚Äôve always had an issue with her having friends or going out. I inform her of my issues with her when it comes to those things‚Ä¶ first, her friends aren‚Äôt married; second, if you can‚Äôt FaceTime or video chat, around your friend is an issue for me. I get that her degree field is male-dominated; however, that doesn‚Äôt mean anything when it comes to who you choose to be friends with. I inform her this isn‚Äôt a vacation or a girls‚Äô trip;  she was removed from our home  due to her actions, yet it seems like I‚Äôm doing everything to get you back home while you party with friends. She said she‚Äôs been taking the necessary classes‚Ä¶ which I reply, so am I; however, I also coordinated with the friend I‚Äôm following up with the state. I‚Äôm making sure the kids are available so she can see them. Yet you‚Äôre constantly saying how much you want to see them but not around. Our conversation ended there. To not yell, now I sit here trying to figure out my next move. The kids are affected by this. Asking why they don‚Äôt see their mom as much when the supervisor is here so Mom could be. I try my best to brush it off, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last. I feel like she‚Äôs not getting my point of view due to her seeing me as a control freak or a parent telling their kid not to do something, which makes them want to do it more. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ any advice

Thank you for reading and thanks in advance for any advice given

TL;DR

A married couple with multiple children is facing marital issues due to differing views on boundaries and the wife‚Äôs social activities. The wife, pursuing a degree, spends most of her time away from home, including late-night school and social outings with classmates, which has led to arguments and a temporary separation. The husband, feeling neglected and concerned about the wife‚Äôs behavior, is struggling to maintain a healthy relationship while caring for the children.",2,1745072569.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

It's painful and I can't go to bars or breweries anymore and have to avoid the alcohol section in stores but I managed. Not a single drop since January 2024 and I crave it sometimes but am able to overcome.

Decided to do the same on New Years of 2025 with fast food and it's been a failure. I tallied up how much I spent so far on fast food chains alone this year and it's $329. That's like 2 months of groceries for me. When I add in my local spots it's $503. I love Rasin Cane's but everything comes in styrofoam or plastic. This morning I really wanted to get a mcmuffin and a large iced coffee which is a huge cup of plastic that gets thrown away. I ended up cooking breakfast and have not bought any fast food for 2 weeks so far but my goodness has it been hard. I'm very minimalistic about everything else but literally cannot break this horrible habit.

People who stopped eating at Taco Bell, McDonald's, etc. How did you do it?

Edit to add: thanks for the advice and encouragement everyone, especially for congratulations on the sobriety. I felt like a lame ass for being weak about alcohol but your words have been a big boost. I will definitely try all of the wonderful advice to finally wrangle the fast food habit.",420,1745072115.0,Anticonsumption,127,0.96,False

Kendu is still a memecoin at heart there is no doubt about it, but we are also a Brand. Under this brand, community members have pursued their passions like creating Kendu Pendants or making murals(the full list will be shown below). When you release a product or create murals or songs you are releasing your creation to an already established user base who will be more than grateful for your contributions. At Kendu there is no ‚Äúteam‚Äù, we are a decentralised movement that is pushing in all directions to take Kendu to the tens of billions.

Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

**How will Kendu help you**

Kendu has around 18k holders and a vast majority are very active, we will support your social media posts and give you a crazy amount of free advertisement and engagement. If it is product based you will also have a steady flow of orders which will only pick up as Kendu grows. Being part of the Kendu community is worth way more than just money, it is also a home where you can pursue passions and make friends.

Here are some examples you can do with Kendu Creator:

* Breakdance
* Parkour
* Singing
* Playing Guitar

Here are some examples of products:

* Kendu Aftershave
* Kendu Chocolate
* Kendu lollipop

**Why Kendu**

Kendu has an enormous catalogue of IRL accomplishments and a social media presence to rival the very biggest in the space all at a market cap of 13 million, all of these initiatives have been completed when holders are in the red, imagine the volume and quality when everyone has an insane amount of money to invest???  
Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe! Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn‚Äôt have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is¬†**unprecedented.**¬†If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I‚Äôd recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore‚Ä¶.

This was the closest I'd ever gotten, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since -- even though this ordeal was a while ago, and only lasted weeks.

Anyways, I met this girl online (in a fucking comment section, mind you) and I wasn't expecting much from it. I was bored, and falling behind my peers romantically. I just wanted someone to talk to.

Well, turns out, we had a lot in common. She was chasing a future that was as bright to her as it was to me. We shared many mutual interests -- and when she showed me her writing, I began to admire her on a deeply personal level. I thought her work was sensitive, honest, and her craftsmanship was immaculate. Her voice was so sharply intelligent. I saw in her the potential for greatness, and the passion to fulfil it. I was almost instantly infatuated.

She was also quite forward. We were flirty, and, not knowing what to do, I tried my best to charm her with compliments and little poetic quips. It worked, for the most part.

There are, of course, many, many more things I liked about her. I found her attractive in a way that is difficult to describe with words; the kind that lingers more like an instinct, than a feeling. I even think of her now, and blush.

After two weeks of talking, we eventually met up. From my limited perspective, those hours with her were among the best in my life. I won't bore you with details; they are, afterall, mine to keep. Objectively, nothing happened. We went to the gallery for a stroll, then sat by the sea, and talked. (Although, I recall she barely even looked at me. Not sure why.)

The day after, in the height of my period hormone induced delusions, I asked her how she felt. She said that it was fun, but that she didn't want a relationship right now. Initially, I didn't say much. I handled it well, although pathetically, I begged her to let me wait. She turned me down with the kind offer of friendship.

After that, the communication sort of just, died. Despite wanting to be ""friends"", I initiated every conversation, and she responded with little enthusiasm. Although oddly enough, she agreed to meet me for coffee.

For the period in between, I simply stopped texting her. Meanwhile, I read an entire novel in the hopes that we would have more to talk about tete-a-tete. 

Even during my silence, I couldn't stop thinking of her. My friends were all sick of my ramblings. They discouraged me from seeing her again -- which was prophetic, considering she never showed up for coffee anyways. 

That, I reacted terribly too. I was so pent up with emotion, that what could have easily been a mistake, was misinterpreted by me as some kind of penance. I ended up confronting her over text, and then eventually, insulting her. The worst part was the stale, corny pun I made before begging her to tell me she hated me, because I ""needed a reason to move on"", as if the rejection wasn't crystal clear. Genius that I was, I felt so ashamed I blocked her immediately. All this, because I hoped I would finally get over her.

That's the story. It all happened months ago, yet nothing has changed. I still look for her in crowds, in rattling train carriages, hoping some kind of divine intervention would grant me another glimpse of her. I have talked to a few other girls since, and they are kind in their own way, but they aren't her. I can no longer find women attractive, without mourning the fact they will never be as beautiful as she was, sitting on that rock by the beach. 

Part of me knows that its just silly girlish thinking, and that I am yearning for someone who doesn't exist. That I cling on not because I love her, but because I loved the idea of what we could have become. Its shallow, selfish, and delusional.

So, as a final plea for help, what should I do? I told my friends and therapist I've moved on only because they expect me to. It's draining, and I need to reserve my energy for my exams.

The warranties on these products are also useless because they make you pay for shipping the product back to the company before they will refund (or perhaps send you another machine; possibly ""refurbished"" and still faulty). 

I wish I could convince them to just get a French press or a pour over, but my Dad insists on having a machine that he can set a timer on so the coffee is ready when he gets up. (I mean, he's nearly 80 and very set in his ways, so I don't see that changing.) 

So, best I can do is let people know here that if you're eying a drip coffee maker (especially Ninja), think twice about buying it. ",18,1745071983.0,enshittification,10,0.92,False
