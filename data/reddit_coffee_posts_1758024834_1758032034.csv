However, recently when trying to run a single shot, nothing comes out. It’s weird because when there are no coffee grounds in the basket (aka pulling a water only shot) the water comes through fine and makes about 40g of water. But once we put coffee grounds in, nothinggg comes out of the portafilter. We can see the water tried to go through because once it’s done running, the grounds are soaked. 
No issues with the double shot. 
What could be wrong??

1niihoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autumn/comments/1niihoe/autumn_and_the_desire_to_feel_it/,Autumn and the desire to feel it.,"Hello. Autumn has long been my favorite time of year, and as all things seem to do with age, its magic seems fleeting and scarce. When I was a kid, the crunch of a leaf could make my entire body shiver with an indescribably feeling of “season.” I remember walking on the sidewalk to the front of my school and seeing the vibrant oranges leaves against the yellow of driving school busses. I remember being in kindergarten, and my teacher had us all make our own Halloween decorations. Black and orange pipe cleaners, purple and green glitter, those scissors with the curvy blades that cut paper into whimsical shapes. 

Autumn was a holiday, but it lasted for months. It was a vacation from the ordinary into a different world that truly felt like something more was afoot. Like the world really was in some liminal place between life and death. I remember kids at school would gather at the lunch table, and we would take turns telling scary stories we heard or made up on the spot, and we’d go home and take those stories with us to bed. The shadows of our rooms were darker in Autumn, and those stories came to life within that darkness. I miss being afraid of the dark. 

Family felt closer. Summer was a time of childlike freedom, where you’d run through the woods and come back hours later, covered in mud and ticks and sweat. You didn’t see your parents unless it was morning, or evening. The day was meant for other things. Summertime was a time of strange isolation to me, which seems to contrast how others feel. I spent time with my two best friends in the summer, getting lost in Appalachian forests and finding our way back home by the notches we cut into trees with our pocket knives. But I only saw those two friends. Autumn came and stole me from my friends, pulled me back into the home, sat me at a table with my parents and my brother. Made me present, made me feel part of something. 

Every year when September comes, I dive into Autumn headfirst. I collect pumpkin scented things, and drink pumpkin flavored things, and display pumpkin shaped things. I watch movies and videos and shows that reflect that Autumn chill that I love. I read and write Autumn poetry, and I listen to Autumn music. Still, something about the season seems to grow farther and farther from me. I struggle to really grasp that feeling, aside from fleeting moments where it hits me all at once but leaves me empty quickly after. Like the feeling at the summit of a rollercoaster. I want it to stay, I want the feeling to linger like fog on Autumn mornings. I want the feeling to live within me for the entirety of the season, but I don’t know how.

Perhaps I’ve run out of Autumn things. I’ve seen the movies and tastes the coffee a thousand times or more, and they’ve lost their haunting feeling. When a new movie comes out that captures that Autumn visage I feel it, until the movie is over. How do I keep it? How do I hold it until the season is over?

This year has been a particularly difficult one for me, and my personal life. I was hoping the season would bring a sense of comfort and ease, but it brings longing more than anything. It brings a desire to feel, not a feeling. I know it’s not far enough yet for the leaves to change, but I feel the chill in the morning, and I see the fog on the hills. I taste it in the air. The sensation hits me like a flashback, like a hallucination, a taste, a smell, but far enough away that I can’t truly experience it. Tell me how to fix it. Tell me how to reignite the fire of Autumn. Tell me how to bring the magic back. 

Please, if you’ve read my rambling, suggest me things, tell me stories. Tell me about your childhood autumns, tell me about your memories trick or treating. Give me recipes to try, products to buy, movies to watch. Recommend me YouTube channels to binge, recommend me poetry or send me your own. Help me. Together, maybe we can bring it back.

I am shaking. I come to the Seattle Kraken ice complex once in a while to work and drink coffee. This morning, I got here at 6 am, and having the stomach bug while pregnant, was curled up on the toilet trying to use the restroom before I started my day. A security guard came in and slammed open all the doors, and when they couldn't push my door open, they knocked and asked if I was alright (obviously trying to gauge if I was suspicious). I said I was fine, and she went away. She came back five minutes later and made me get out. I had never been in a vulnerable position like this before but it was violating. Especially because I stopped coming here for a while because I didn't feel safe about a man who wouldn't leave me alone while I worked who had followed me from cafe to cafe. I only came back here because it had Starbucks and he didn't seem to be around anymore. 

She informed me that the rest room is only for patrons. I am confused considering I buy coffee from the Starbucks and usually spend the day there. Why am I assumed to not be a patron? Because Im not in my Sunday best? Because I had a mask on to be considerate to others? Because the only comfortable way I could use the restroom was to be curled up on the toilet? Am I not allowed to empty my bowels the way I see fit within the stall?? I got mad, and yelled at her. I did not accept her apology, and I feel bad that I lost my temper, but I honestly no longer feel safe at this location. I've been coming here for years. I can't even feel safe to empty my bowels in a place that's supposed to be safe.  ",2,1758031491.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1niiekc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1niiekc/aitah_for_overreacting_or_did_my_girlfriend_cross/,"AITAH for overreacting, or did my girlfriend cross a line emotionally?","Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some perspective on a situation involving trust, jealousy, and emotional boundaries in my relationship. Some background first:

I'm a 29-year-old guy dating a 21-year-old woman (I know there’s an age gap). We met in the summer of 2024 and dated casually until March 2025, when we became official. We live about an hour apart and don’t live together.
I have a female friend I met through work around the same time I met my girlfriend. We’ve always just been friends. We worked together until this spring, when I left for a new job, but we’ve kept in touch mostly through Snapchat. She usually reaches out first, asking for advice or help with something. We’ve met up for coffee twice since I left the job, most recently about a week ago.

Now, my girlfriend doesn’t like that I have a female friend I meet alone, which I totally understand—I probably wouldn’t be thrilled about it either. I’ve always been honest about the friendship and when we meet up. She’s said it’s fine if we hang out in group settings, but not one-on-one, because it feels too much like a “date.” She’s okay with us talking on Snapchat, since she also has male friends she Snapchats with—but unlike her, I only have one female friend I chat with, while she frequently “dry snaps” multiple guys.

Last week, after I met up with my friend, my girlfriend wanted to meet her too. Afterward, my girlfriend told me she thinks this friend is into me—even though my friend just moved in with her own boyfriend. My girlfriend has been struggling with jealousy and admitted this openly.

A few days ago, she was upset late at night (around 1:30 AM) and received a Snapchat from a male coworker. She replied with a picture of herself crying. He asked what was wrong, and she told him she was having relationship problems—with me. The next day, he invited her to a concert later this year.
Later that same day, she told me she didn’t want me meeting my friend alone anymore. I said okay. That’s when she told me about the crying Snap she sent to her coworker, and the concert invitation. I told her I felt uncomfortable with her sharing intimate emotional stuff—and a crying selfie—with another man. It felt like she was seeking emotional comfort from him in a way that crossed a line. She said all her female friends were asleep, and she apologized, saying she didn’t do it intentionally and felt bad about it afterward.

She also mentioned that she doesn’t really talk to this coworker much, and that she’d be happy to remove him from Snapchat if I’m uncomfortable with their contact. She’s even said she’s willing to delete all her male friends on Snapchat if that’s what it takes for me to feel comfortable not meeting my female friend alone anymore.

So now I’m left wondering—Did she cross an emotional boundary here? Was this a mild form of emotional cheating? Or am I overreacting because I have a female friend I’ve met alone?

With a focus on eco-friendly practices, modern design, and functional packaging that meets industry standards, MTPak has become a trusted partner for brands across diverse industries. From coffee roasters to retail businesses, its solutions are shaping the way packaging contributes to both environmental preservation and brand identity.

# Innovation in Packaging Solutions

One of the standout qualities of MTPak is its commitment to innovation. In an age where packaging is more than just a container, [**MTPak**](https://mtpak.com/) integrates functionality with design, ensuring that products are well-protected while leaving a memorable impression on customers. For example, coffee packaging, one of MTPak’s core offerings, is crafted with advanced barrier materials to preserve freshness and flavor. At the same time, the company uses modern printing techniques that allow brands to personalize every aspect of their packaging. By combining durability with visual appeal, MTPak enables businesses to stand out in competitive markets while meeting the high standards of product safety and presentation.

Innovation at MTPak also extends to design flexibility. Businesses can choose from a wide variety of packaging formats—such as flat-bottom pouches, stand-up pouches, and recyclable kraft bags—each tailored to meet unique product needs. This ability to provide highly customizable options gives brands the freedom to express their identity while keeping pace with the growing demand for sustainable alternatives. In effect, MTPak bridges the gap between functionality and creativity, ensuring packaging becomes a tool for storytelling rather than just a necessity.

With environmental concerns at an all-time high, businesses are under pressure to minimize their ecological footprint, and MTPak plays a pivotal role in helping them achieve this goal. The company emphasizes the use of recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable materials, allowing brands to adopt eco-friendly packaging without compromising on performance. By introducing solutions such as water-based inks, compostable coffee bags, and recyclable kraft paper, MTPak empowers companies to reduce waste and meet the expectations of environmentally conscious consumers.

Sustainability is not just a buzzword for MTPak—it is an actionable mission. The brand continuously researches and implements the latest green technologies, ensuring that their packaging solutions comply with global environmental standards. For example, compostable bags break down naturally within industrial composting facilities, significantly reducing landfill waste. This level of responsibility demonstrates how MTPak goes beyond business success, contributing to long-term environmental preservation.

# Supporting Businesses and Brand Identity

Packaging is one of the first touchpoints between a brand and its customer, and MTPak understands this crucial role better than most. Their packaging solutions are not just about sustainability or product protection—they are also about creating a strong, memorable brand identity. By offering custom-printed packaging, businesses can showcase their logos, values, and stories directly on their products. This level of personalization strengthens customer relationships and helps companies stand out in competitive industries.

For small businesses and startups, MTPak provides flexible order quantities, making premium and eco-friendly packaging accessible without requiring large investments. This approach helps emerging brands compete with larger companies by offering them the same level of professional packaging quality.

1niicfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalproductselling/comments/1niicfn/i_made_938_in_1_day_selling_a_1333_digital_product/,I made $938 in 1 day selling a $13.33 digital product,"Here’s exactly how I did it, and you can literally steal this if you want.



Step 0: Where the idea came from. I wasn’t about to make any digital product. I went into Facebook groups, Reddit subs, and even other course communities I’m in. I paid attention to what people were complaining about not what gurus said they “should” want.



The pattern? People wanted to make money online without: 1. Creating their own product (too hard, takes too long) 2. Selling high ticket stuff that requires begging strangers for $500+ 3. Getting peanuts for commission rates (40%–60%). I made mine where they get 100% profit 😏



So I made something stupid simple, valuable, and easy to resell. A done for you $13.33 ebook bundle that they can resell for 100% profit. No revenue share. No waiting for payouts. You sell it, you keep it.



Step 1: Build something valuable but simple. My bundle wasn’t a random ebook. It came with: • A 70+ page ebook (What to Post When You Need Sales by Friday) • Video training version of the ebook • Lazy Money Launch Notes (my exact behind the scenes framework) • A workbook so they can follow along • Access to my private community where I go live daily with strategies



I made it so good people would feel dumb saying no.



Step 2: Price it like a no brainer. $13.33 is I won’t even think about it pricing. People spend more than that daily without blinking. coffee, DoorDash tips, random Amazon crap.



Step 3: Post like you mean it. I followed my own framework. I didn’t wait for the algorithm to be in the mood. I made enough noise that ignoring me wasn’t an option.



Step 4: Sell where buyers are (not just where my followers hang out). I hit niche communities and psychographic matches. people who fit the lifestyle my product speaks to. Plus, I used promotional FB groups that allow selling.



Step 5: Urgency. I made it clear that my price wasn’t going to stay that low forever, and I meant it. Scarcity works when you’re not bluffing.



Mistakes along the way (so you don’t repeat them) • I originally priced it too high because I thought low ticket = low value (wrong) • I wasted a full week posting in dead groups before I filtered for ones with real engagement. • I overexplained in some posts. people don’t need a TED Talk to buy a $13 product.



Steal this if you want If you want to take this same model. same done for you bundle, same resell rights, same 100% profit structure I already made the product for you. Your only job would be to sell it.



And if you’d rather make your own? Cool. Just reverse engineer what I laid out above and go get your own $900+ day.",2,1758031303.0,digitalproductselling,0,1.0,False

(who'm I kidding) Yesterday my gf saw a flight attendant getting home from work, still in her flight attendant uniform. She was like *""Wow! Who is* ***that?*** *She's* ***so pretty!*** *She looks* ***so good!*** *That uniform looks* ***amazing!****""* edit: not the fucking typo in my post title lmao

I have travelled a metric buttload, so I was like ""probably a flight attendant"", which was later confirmed in the elevator when I saw the name of the airline on her bags (in big letters, I wasn't being creepy or nothing)

anyway this got me thinking, like I said, I have travelled A LOT and it occurred to me I have never, but \*\*\*NEVER\*\*\* seen a badly-dressed or ill-appearing flight attendant. NEVER. EVER. almost as if it's impossible. NOT ONCE. not even when it's oh-fuck-off-early in the morning and they're on their way to work. they always look freshly scrubbed, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed (inb4 ""it's cocaine"") their uniforms are always clean and *sharp as fuck.*

compare and contrast in security, where you got your XL-tall-sized guards wearing 2XL reg because the multi-billion-dollar company's Logistics department somehow can't keep its fucking shirts organized or in sufficient supply, and everybody basically looks like dogshit ***even though*** ""you ***must*** wear your complete uniform at all times because professional appearance is *soooooooooo important* and it factors into the use-of-force (which you might be trained but you're not allowed to use because da cwient wouldn't wike it UwU) because the uniform is a 'symbol of authority' and people will respect it if it's smartly turned-out and clean and pretty and looks nice and ironed and blah blah blah"" none of which actually happens or matters because even if your boots are shone and your pants and shirt creased and your body armour actually clean, the uniform overwhelmingly looks and fits like dogshit.

it's kind of a known joke/trope that air travel, in general, is badly organized and airlines are (intentionally) bad at many things because they are motivated by profit, however the one thing that's consistent across the globe no matter where you are or which airline is flight attendants look great.

I can't imagine it's all that expensive to set up in-house tailoring if appearance is SO IMPORTANT and matters SO MUCH. did all these fucking high-powered business school graduates suffer acute head trauma on the way to owning/running companies?

the other worst part is my family has a military background, so apart from flight attendants I have another reference for what uniforms *can* look like if the organization actually gives a shit. I don't even bother cleaning my armour panel carrier at this point because I'm like none of this shit matters, the rest of the uniform is dogshit anyway so who gives a shit if this has a coffee stain on it. also my fucking nametag is always upside-down or falling off because some business school genius thought it should be held on with MAGNETS instead of a fucking safety pin. you know, the tag that I HAVE TO WEAR BY LAW OR ME AND THE COMPANY CAN BOTH BE FINED.

I have a siemens EQ.500 CLASSIC coffeemaker that’s not working properly.

It grinds the beans and starts making coffee, but after a few ml of coffee it stops and cancels the task. It does however give the correct amount water if i only want hot water for tea.

I cleaned the whole brewing unit (completely dissassembeled it) and replaced the little hose (it had a small stress break), but sadly nothing changed.

What could be the cause? I feel like the pump makes a lot of noise, but maybe thats because the side panel is open. Could it be the red o-ring in the brewing group? or what else should i take a look at?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

at first I thought I was just bad at mornings, but then I learned about **cortisol** (stress hormone) and how it naturally spikes after you wake up. the spike itself is normal. what messes things up is when your habits pile extra pressure on top of it. that’s when you feel like the world is ending even tho you’re literally just tying your shoes.

I started experimenting with really small shifts, nothing shiny or “Instagram routine” level. the thing that surprised me most was that it didn’t take 30 minutes of meditation to change my mornings.... just 2 minutes of slowing my breath down helped convince my body it wasn’t in danger. sometimes I’ll stand near the window for light, or tell myself “just do one thing, any one thing” instead of staring at a giant to‑do list.

it honestly feels silly how small those steps are, but the impact is real: I don’t start the day in panic mode anymore, and I end up actually getting more done by lunchtime than I used to in a whole morning.

The year is 2019, I'm a regular individual investor with a day job (still am). I enjoy reading ""Motley Fool"", but am annoyed with the constant click-baity ""5 can't miss stocks of the century"" posts. 

They finally got me. For some reason, I was really curious at a ""Can't Miss Stock"" they recommended, so I joined their premium program and saw the name: Luckin Coffee.

[image](https://d2qkqhh60b0n0e.cloudfront.net/images/a624fe47-bc49-4bf4-9894-cd5524fc4bce)

I'm a big believer in investing in what you know. Since I have never been to China, I wasn't too interested in a Chinese coffee company, so I decided not to take a position.

Oooh boy, I'm glad I didn't take a position. 

In 2020, the company was found guilty of some gnarly SEC violations (fabricating sales figures) and was delisted from NASDAQ. Many investors experienced total, or near-total loss. 

This taught me three lessons:* Be wary of Chinese stocks (this isn't Sinophobic)
* Never blindly follow stock tips 
* Invest in what you know

But! the company is back. They fired all employees and executives that participated in the fraud. 

And they're trying to move into the US market. They recently opened up 5 coffee shops in NYC. 

[image](https://d2qkqhh60b0n0e.cloudfront.net/images/a9991756-bdec-4113-80be-c9867007e07e)

Luckin's key selling point: * Mobile only orders (cuts down wait times)
* Shower the user with discount codes
* Average coffee costs ~$2.00 

The company is currently trading on the OTC markets since it was delisted from NASDAQ after the fraud scandal. Berstein did analysis and believes the company's running a loss with their NYC operations. 

All in all, I'm not to worried about Luckin taking over Starbucks. They are very different businesses, and I'm not sure that the US will adopt the mobile only experience. 

I highly recommend watching this 10 minute video from CNBC on the matter: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqDvnmMswXA)

The dream of YouTube success is often sold as a lottery ticket. You're told to chase viral trends, post content daily, and hope the algorithm blesses you with fame and fortune. This path is a well-trodden road to burnout. Creators spend thousands on equipment and coaching, only to find themselves stuck in a cycle of creating content that gets views but generates no real income. They are trapped, answering to an algorithm that rewards quantity over quality and leaves them exhausted with little to show for it.

The advice from so-called gurus often makes the problem worse. They push expensive gear, complicated editing software, and the need to hire a team before you've even made your first dollar. This traditional model is broken. It's designed to benefit the sellers of courses and equipment, not the aspiring creator. It ignores the simple truth that a small, dedicated audience of buyers is far more valuable than a massive, passive audience of viewers. The game has changed, and the old rules no longer apply.

# The Core Problems Channel Profit Sprint Addresses

Most YouTube training programs fail because they teach you how to become a ""YouTuber"" in the traditional sense, focusing on metrics that don't translate to a sustainable business. They prepare you for a marathon of content creation without a clear path to monetization. Channel Profit Sprint is built on a different foundation. It identifies and solves the critical roadblocks that stop most creators from ever achieving profitability.

# The Content Idea Dead End

The pressure to come up with new, engaging video ideas every day is immense. This leads to creative paralysis. Creators spend hours brainstorming, only to produce videos on topics that have no connection to what an audience would actually purchase. They follow fleeting trends that are irrelevant a week later, leaving them with a library of content that has a short shelf life and no long-term value. This constant scramble for ideas is a primary cause of creator burnout.

# The Scripting and Authenticity Struggle

Without a clear structure, videos become rambling, unfocused, and fail to hold a viewer's attention. This results in low watch time, which signals to the YouTube algorithm that the content is not valuable, leading to suppressed reach. Many creators, unsure of what to say, either over-script and sound robotic or ""wing it"" and fail to deliver a clear message or call to action. At the same time, the rise of ""faceless"" AI-generated content is being actively penalized by YouTube, which prioritizes genuine, human connection. Creators are caught between needing structure and needing to sound authentic.

# The Monetization Maze

For new channels, the path to making money is often unclear and seems impossibly far away. The standard advice is to aim for YouTube Partner Program requirements, which can take years. Affiliate marketing is presented as an alternative, but without a system, it becomes a guessing game. Creators randomly drop links in their descriptions, hoping for a few clicks. They lack a method for creating content specifically designed to convert viewers into customers for affiliate products, leaving a significant amount of potential revenue untapped.

# A Deep Dive into the Channel Profit Sprint System

Channel Profit Sprint is not another lengthy course filled with abstract theories. It is a 7-day intensive training program delivered in a ""challenge format."" This structure is designed for maximum consumption and immediate application. Each day presents a simple, actionable mission that builds upon the last. The entire system is engineered to take you from zero to having your first affiliate commission-ready video live and working for you by the end of the week.

# The Guiding Principles of the System

The program operates on a few core principles that separate it from traditional YouTube growth strategies. First is the focus on creating ""buyer-first"" content. This means every video is reverse-engineered from a profitable affiliate offer, ensuring that the content attracts viewers who are already interested in a solution. Second is the use of ""AI-assisted authenticity."" The system provides tools that handle the heavy lifting of scripting and idea generation, allowing the creator to focus on delivering their unique perspective and personality. Finally, it emphasizes the creation of evergreen assets, videos that can rank and generate commissions for months or even years, freeing you from the daily content treadmill.

# Who Can Benefit from This System?

This training is built for a specific type of individual. It is ideal for beginners who want a clear roadmap to their first dollar online without the steep learning curve. It is also perfect for existing affiliate marketers who are tired of the slow grind of blogging or the high cost of paid advertising. Coaches, consultants, and service providers will find it to be a powerful tool for generating qualified leads. The system is designed for anyone who can dedicate a few hours a week to building a real, income-generating asset.

Conversely, this system is not for those looking for a ""get rich quick"" scheme. It is not for creators who want to build ""faceless"" AI spam channels, as that model is becoming less viable. It is also not suited for individuals who are unwilling to niche down and focus on a specific audience with a specific problem. The success of this method hinges on following the step-by-step process as laid out.

# The 7-Day Challenge: A Day-by-Day Journey

The core of the program is its 7-day sprint. Each day focuses on one critical element of building a profitable YouTube channel, ensuring you make consistent progress without feeling overwhelmed.

# Day 1: Mapping Your YouTube Growth Engine

The first day is all about strategy. You will learn how to select a profitable niche and pair it with high-converting affiliate offers. This foundational step ensures that you are building your channel on solid ground. You will map out a content plan that is aligned with products and services that your target audience is actively looking to buy.

# Day 2: Creating 15+ Video Ideas With AI

Say goodbye to brainstorming. On the second day, you will use the ""Infinite Idea Engine"" to generate a list of video topics that have built-in buyer intent. This tool analyzes your niche and chosen affiliate offers to produce titles and concepts that are engineered to attract potential customers, not just casual viewers.

# Day 3: Plugging In Your Video Scripts

With your video ideas ready, day three is about crafting the perfect script. You will get access to ""Plug-and-Post Script & Templates."" This AI-powered tool allows you to input your topic and receive a structured script in seconds. The scripts are trained on thousands of successful YouTube videos and include optimized hooks, value delivery segments, and calls to action designed to drive clicks to your affiliate offers.

# Day 4: Your First Affiliate Video

This is the day you put it all together. Using the script from day three, you will record your first video. The system emphasizes simplicity, showing you how to get great results with just a smartphone. The focus is on clear communication and authentic delivery, not on having expensive production equipment.

# Day 5: The Smart Scheduling System

Once your video is ready, day five teaches you how to optimize it for the YouTube algorithm. You will learn the best practices for titles, descriptions, tags, and thumbnails to maximize your video's visibility. You will also learn about the ""Smart Scheduling System"" to determine the optimal times to publish your content for your specific audience.

# Day 6: Channel Profit Activation

On day six, you will learn how to turn your channel into a lead-generating machine. This goes beyond just adding links to your description. You will discover strategies for using YouTube's community features and comment sections to engage with your audience and guide them toward your affiliate offers.

# Day 7: Scaling Your Income

The final day of the challenge focuses on long-term growth. You will learn how to analyze your video's performance and use that data to refine your content strategy. You will also be introduced to methods for scaling your income, including how to repurpose your content for other platforms and how to explore additional monetization streams as your channel grows.

# Four Ways to Build an Income with This System

The skills and tools you acquire in Channel Profit Sprint open up multiple pathways to generating revenue. Here are four practical models you can implement.

# Model 1: The Niche Affiliate Marketer

This is the core model taught in the program. You choose a niche, such as home coffee brewing, and create content reviewing and comparing products like espresso machines and grinders. Your videos, scripted with the AI tools, will attract people ready to buy, and you will earn commissions from every sale made through your links.

# Model 2: The Sponsored Content Creator

As your channel grows, brands will notice. Using the strategies from the Monetize Me Masterplan, you can proactively reach out to companies in your niche and offer sponsored content placements. A channel about sustainable living, for example, could partner with eco-friendly brands for dedicated review videos, generating a fixed fee on top of affiliate income.

# Model 3: The Digital Product Seller

Your YouTube channel is the perfect platform to sell your own products. If you run a channel about gardening, you can use the ""Offer Alchemist GPT"" to create and sell a digital guide like ""The Beginner's Guide to Urban Gardening."" Your videos provide free value, building trust and leading viewers to your paid product.

# Model 4: The Lead Generator for Services

For coaches, consultants, or freelancers, a YouTube channel can be a powerful lead generation tool. A real estate agent could create videos about ""Tips for First-Time Homebuyers in \[Your City\]."" This content attracts their ideal clients, and the calls to action can direct viewers to book a consultation, filling their client pipeline.

1nii0rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nii0rb/how_can_i_improve_my_health_by_being_more_active/,How can I improve my health by being more active while struggling with anxiety?,"Hi everyone! I (28F) have struggled with anxiety pretty much my entire life, for as long as I can remember. Back in March of 2020, at the height of Covid — I got really sick with it and was pretty much bed/couch ridden for several months. Prior to this, I was fairly active — I worked at a coffee shop so I was on my feet up to 12 hours a day moving at a fast pace, I went to the gym ~2x a week (not super intensely but still running, walking, lifting light weights, etc) and was overall just moving my body way more. After I got sick and went into quarantine, this came to an abrupt end. I quit my job at the coffee shop to make a move to a new city, and started a desk job. Additionally, the long term symptoms that came after having Covid really threw me off. 

Fast forward 5 years now, and I am still working said desk job (from home) and feel like I am not moving my body nearly enough. I constantly feel sore and tight. I haven’t step foot in a gym in those 5 years. I do occasionally go on mild walks and hikes, but to be honest, I can hardly go up 2 flights of stairs without being winded and out of breath. 

My problem is, with my sickness in 2020 also came heightened health anxiety (which has always been present in my life but became WAY more intense after I got sick with Covid). With this, I became so terrified of overworking myself and hurting myself, pulling or straining something, my heart going out on me/going into cardiac arrest, etc. So, I have just been avoidant all together. I AM medicated for this, I take 25mg of Zoloft daily which has helped tone it down a bit but the fears are definitely real and still there. 

My goal is to improve cardio so that I don’t get so winded after going up a couple flights of stairs, I’d love to tone my core/abs and my arms… I want to LOOK better but mainly — I just want to FEEL healthy again, I want my body to not feel so tight and sore all the time! I want to wake up in the morning feeling like a younger, healthier version of myself! 

I guess I am just looking for advice, words of encouragement and similar success stories to help me get going. I appreciate you if you read this entire thing, it truly means the world and I am genuinely grateful for any advice or words of encouragement that is given. Thank you!

For reference as well, I am 28 years old (F), 5’6 and weigh in around 125lbs.

The last time I saw you I felt something shift between us, I wonder if you felt it too. We were both so happy to be in each others presence, to talk and laugh together, to look at things we both enjoy. You’re so smart and talented, it was really cool to see that jeep you worked on at the car show. It was a beautiful car, I could tell you were proud of it, I know I would be.
… And I know I saw you catching a glance at me, I saw you fluster when I turned to meet your gaze. I’ve thought about that every day since, because I never thought you’d dare to look at me the same way I was too afraid to look at you. 

We were going to hang out again the next weekend, I offered alternate plans of being alone instead of going to a show, “coffee and a joyride”. I didn’t think much of it, it was going to rain. No one really goes to a rainy car show. If I knew you’d be so frightened by my text, I never would have sent it. The last thing I wanted to do was make you uncomfortable. I saw you the next day at the meet, it looked like you were trying to run away from me…

Last weekend you leaned in close, laughed with me, glanced at me, made space for me in conversations with your friends, made me smile, made my heart feel warm… and the next I saw you running away, avoiding me, too scared to engage. 

I blamed myself for thinking I did something wrong… I can’t blame myself for how others react, but I still feel sorry. 

I pray that just our friendship alone can withstand the awkwardness. I pray you find comfort and guidance in whatever you’re feeling on your side of this journey. I have a feeling your reaction is hurting you more than it hurt me, and I pray you heal from that. 

I won’t contact you for a while, I think it’s best for both of us… the few days of clarity alone have helped me understand a few things about the situation, about you… I’m trying to see this circumstance as a good thing, because it helps me understand you better.

From the moment I started using the LG WM3400CW, its spacious design and sleek white finish caught my attention. As a 4.5 cubic feet front-load washer, this machine promised—and mostly delivered—a blend of efficiency and reliability. Being someone who typically stacks up laundry for the weekend, I immediately tested its ""Ultra Large Capacity,"" and yes, it handled bulky loads of towels and jeans up to 20 pounds like a true champ. However, as much as I appreciated its performance, there are definitely some things to address.  

**Features That Stand Out**  

The first thing I noticed was the 6Motion Technology, which felt like a complete game changer. By combining six different washing movements, my clothes came out notably cleaner without taking a beating. It even managed to remove stains from a shirt that had suffered one too many coffee spills. The washer’s ColdWash Technology also surprised me. Honestly, I’d been skeptical about washing with cold water, but this feature delivered results comparable to warm water without eating away at my utility bill—a definite win.  

[Check LG WM3400CW price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b08bhktqyp/)  

**Performance and Everyday Use**  

Spending weeks with this washer, I experimented with most of its eight standard cycles (Normal, Delicates, Heavy Duty, etc.), and while all performed adequately, the Speed Wash cycle became my go-to. It’s brilliant for small to medium loads when you’re in a rush and still leaves clothes fresh and wrinkle-free. However, I found the Extra Rinse and Spin Only options especially helpful for items needing additional care, like my gym gear. One thing though—if you're like me and occasionally forget that you’ve left clothes in the drum, be prepared for some post-wash wrinkles during longer cycles.  

**Highlights**  
- Ultra Large Capacity accommodates up to 20 pounds, perfect for families or laundry enthusiasts.  
- 6Motion Technology ensures effective, gentle washing with six unique movements.  
- ColdWash Technology mimics warm water performance, cutting down energy consumption.  
- SenseClean System adjusts water level and wash time automatically, catering to load size and type.  

**Drawbacks**  

I had several moments of annoyance too. For starters, the SmartDiagnosis feature is a cool concept but not all that practical. I had trouble with a minor error code (likely caused by my over-zealous loading), but the app instructions didn’t provide sufficient clarity and still left me guessing. Additionally, the 1300 RPM spin speed could make the drum a bit noisier than I expected at high settings—especially when I forgot to balance heavy items properly in my load.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- SmartDiagnosis may not resolve all troubleshooting issues effectively.  
- High-speed spin settings can produce noticeable noise during operation.  
- Wrinkles appear if clothes sit in the drum post-cycle for too long.  

**Ease of Control**  

The touch buttons and the Dial-A-Cycle system worked intuitively and were relatively easy to figure out. Even my tech-averse aunt, who babysat my place for a week, managed to learn the controls quickly. I did miss having a proper backlit panel for dim laundry rooms, though. Squinting to select options at night wasn’t particularly fun. Moreover, the child lock feature is brilliant for parents. It ensured that nothing mischievous happened when my nephew decided to press random buttons.  

**Alternative Offerings**  

In comparison to Samsung’s WF45R6100AW and Whirlpool WFW5620HW, the LG WM3400CW holds its ground reasonably well but isn’t without its shortcomings against such competitors. Samsung offers a greater variety of customizable cycles, and Whirlpool’s washer, with its Load & Go feature, reduces annoyance by managing detergent use for multiple washes. Where LG really shines is its 6Motion Technology, which combines innovative cleaning with fabric care. That said, people looking for extremely quiet operation may prefer Samsung's slightly more hushed performance.  

**Smart Spending**  

When evaluating the washer’s cost, I’d say the LG WM3400CW offers decent bang for the buck. While it doesn’t include extravagant bells and whistles like built-in Wi-Fi or steam cycles, its reliable performance and energy efficiency justify its asking price for average household needs. In the long run, the energy savings balance out a lot of the initial investment. Though it’s positioned as an entry-to-mid-level washer, it still meets most home laundering demands without feeling underpowered.

In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

There will be over 40 different prepared and packaged small business food vendors representing cuisines from all over Latin America offering their takes on *comida callejera* (street food) and more, including Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Chile, Peruvian, and more. From tacos to empanadas, alcapurrias to ceviche, and mixiotes to arepas, there will be plenty for your taste buds to savor.

With food in hand, then grab a theme-crafted cocktail featuring spirits and flavors from the Americas, including a summer sangrita, a pirata horchata caribeña, an Andean piña breeze, or a Oaxacan old fashioned. The bars will also have beers, seltzers, and n/a drinks. Additional vendors will be selling agua frescas, liquados, lemonades, iced coffees, and more.

Then cap off the night with a decadent dessert…or three. Churros covered dulce de leche, paletas, fresh fruit, ice cream, cookies…the choices are nearly endless.

Shop at the artisan craft vendors. Make art in the Adult Chill Zone with CHAC Gallery while listening to DJs spin Latin beats. Or hang with your kids in the Family Fun Zone and make art with Museo de las Americas and Biennial of the Americas. Then catch one of the cultural performances in the Greek Theater.

It’s going to be a night filled with good eats and *buenas vibras*.

Every time he comes to pick me up from somewhere, I check our child’s seatbelt, and it’s not fastened.

On top of that, he keeps giving him sweets, chocolate, and even Coca-Cola. Once I even caught him giving him coffee. I‘m honestly so uncomfortable leaving my son alone with him.

1nihoqj,https://i.redd.it/mu9lrwr05jpf1.jpeg,Extremely fast shots at finest grind setting (18g in -> 36g out in 18s) [Sage Barista Express],"Hi everyone,

I need some help with my new (to me) coffee machine. I'm a complete beginner when it comes to espresso and have only been using the double-wall basket until now. I've spent a couple of days trying to ""dial in"" my machine, but it's just not working.

My shot is flowing way too fast on my Sage Barista Express. I'm getting 36g of espresso in only 18 seconds (timed from the moment I press the button), whereas I'm aiming for the golden 25-30 second range.

Here are my parameters:

* **Machine:** Sage/Breville Barista Express
* **Basket:** Double-shot, single-wall basket.
* **Grind Setting:** I have ground the coffee as fine as the machine will possibly go (Internal burr at 1 and the side dial at 1) to extend the extraction time, but it's not helping.
* **Beans:** Fresh beans from my local roastery (roasted in August).
* **Dose:** I've meticulously measured 18g of coffee.
* **Prep:** I've used a WDT tool and tamped as level and firm as I can.

I release the double-shot button as soon as the first drops of espresso start to flow from the portafilter. I can see the pressure gauge slowly rising into the ""Espresso Range,"" and it's right around that point that I stop the shot.

Can any experienced baristas see what might be wrong with my method?

Thank you so much in advance.",2,1758029744.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

But the events in the story are 100% original and did not use any outside sources to assist in writing the story.

Simon Carn is a real volcanologist who studies the behavior of volcanoes around the world and is still alive to this day.

It was 5:00 AM when James’ alarm went off for the second time,

“Oh shut up, will you?” he said to the alarm as he hit the snooze button.

I reluctantly got out of bed and got dressed. I made myself a cup of coffee and an omelet, then got in my 2000 Ford F-150 and drove over to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. By the time I arrived, it was around 6:30. So I checked in and headed up to the labs, where we keep an eye on the Yellowstone geysers, because recently they have been erupting water more frequently. 

“So, what do the geysers look like today?” I asked my assistant, Grace.

“Same as yesterday, and the day before, and the day before,” Grace replied. “The only thing different is the eruptions, they’re a little taller than before.”

“Alrighty then, so I guess we don’t need to be too worried,” I said as I walked over to the lab coats and put one on,

“Not really, the temperature of the water has increased by 26 degrees last night,” said Grace.

“Whew, that's quite a lot. Why do you think this is happening?” I asked.

“I don’t know, maybe it's got something to do with higher pressure before the explosions,” Grace guessed.

“No, I mean, the more frequent eruptions, could the higher temperature be related to the eruptions?” I speculated.

“I don’t know. Should we get a volcanologist over here to check it out?” Asked Grace.

“Hmm, maybe. Let's wait a little bit more to watch out for any more abnormalities.” I said.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of the day wasn’t that eventful, besides the fact that the water temperature was slowly increasing and people were seeing weird occurrences of the animals running from something, but nothing was chasing them. But I continued studying the geyser's behavior, trying to discern any patterns or insights from the geyser. Predictably, I didn’t find anything.

But people who were at the geysers noticed that the geysers were bubbling a lot more than usual. And in some areas, the ground was feeling a little warm and damp, as if the frozen water was melting, even though it was the middle of winter. Grace and I took note of that and checked it out during the day, so when we went over to the spot, we checked the ground, and it was a little warm and even damp.

But soon enough, the time for the work to be finished came. So I went home, cooked myself a nice little dinner, then got ready for bed. At around 10:00, I stopped my reading and went to sleep.

It was at 5:30 AM when Grace called me, saying that I had to get over to the lab, fast. I had to skip breakfast and even my morning coffee and rushed over to the lab. When I got there, I checked in at the front and jogged over to the lab. 

“What's happening!” I asked as I burst through the doors.

“You won’t believe it, but the water temperature increased over 150 degrees last night!” Grace exclaimed.

“150 Degrees! Holy sh\*\*, we need to call him, have you called him yet?” I asked Grace.

“It’s already done, he’ll be here in about two hours,” she said.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two hours later, Simon Carn arrived at the lab with an anxious expression.

“Update me,” Simon said.

“The water temperature has increased 37 degrees since I called, so the water temperature is now 435 degrees, and there are even some new springs forming!” Exclaimed Grace.

“That is incredibly concerning. The magma below the springs must be actively getting pushed up and getting closer to the springs,” Simon speculated.

“There are also reports coming in saying that the ice on the Yellowstone River and Lake is rapidly melting,” I chime in.

“Ok, so this is way more serious than I thought. We need to evacuate everyone in Wyoming in case the volcano erupts,” Simon thought out loud.

“Wait, What! In case the volcano erupts, what do you mean!?” Shouted Grace.

“Ok, so, Yellowstone National Park is really just a supervolcano, not a normal one. So if it erupts, nothing in Wyoming will be left, and it would affect the entire world,” Simon said.

“Oh, my god, we might actually die,” said Grace in a panicked voice.",1,1758029705.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

So, we all know that feeling when you wake up and your body just feels a little... well, *stiff*? 🥴 It’s like you’ve been sleeping in a pretzel position or something. I mean, why is it that getting out of bed after 50 feels like trying to start an old car in the dead of winter? 

When you’re feeling like a rusty hinge, chances are you’ve wondered: **what’s the best way to shake off that morning stiffness and get some energy?** Is it gentle morning stretches or an invigorating afternoon walk? Let’s break it down! 🚶‍♀️🧘‍♀️

### Morning Stretches: 
**Why They Rock!**
- **Wake Up Those Muscles**: Gentle stretching can help increase blood flow. Think of it as a delicious cup of coffee for your muscles!
- **Set the Tone**: Start your day on a positive note. That little stretch may just be the motivation you need to tackle the day.
- **Low-Impact**: Great for those of us who may be a bit creaky. No need to jump into an advanced yoga class right away!

👩‍🦳 *Personal Story*: I started a little morning stretch routine where I do some simple neck rolls and reach for the sky. Honestly, it feels like I’ve hit the “refresh” button on my entire day. Suddenly, I don’t feel like I’m 80—maybe just 70! 😂

### Afternoon Walks:
**Why They’re Awesome!**
- **Boost Your Mood**: Walking outside can do wonders for your mental state. Sunshine?! Yes, please! 🌞 
- **Social Time**: Grab a buddy (or even your dog) and make it a social affair. Who knew little strolls could foster friendships?
- **Heart Health**: It gets your heart pumping! We believe in strongest people, and walking is a super easy way to show some love to your ticker. 💖 [Check it out here!](https://mavely.app.link/e/aCtf6hngjUb)

🤔 *Rhetorical Moment*: Who wouldn’t want an excuse to step outside, breathe in the fresh air, and clear their head? It almost feels like a mini-vacation from reality!

### So, which one wins for instant energy?
Honestly, it might depend on your mood or how you're feeling on that particular day. Some mornings, all I want is to stretch it out, while other days, I just need to get up and MOVE. Isn’t that the beauty of being this age? We get to choose what our bodies need! 

If you still feel a little stiff after all this, don’t sweat it—every little bit counts. A few gentle stretches in the morning and a short walk in the afternoon can really add up to make you feel surprisingly *spry*! 🙌

What about you? What do you find helps shake off that stiffness? Your thoughts are welcome—who knows, you might just inspire someone else with your routines!",1,1758029546.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1nihl5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nihl5b/does_seventh_generation_dishwasher_detergent/,Does Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent 22170CT Really Deliver Sparkling Clean Dishes? Review,"**Testing the Seventh Generation 22170CT Dishwasher Detergent Gel**  

The first time I tried Seventh Generation's 22170CT Free and Clear Dishwasher Detergent Gel, I wasn't just hoping for clean dishes—I wanted a product that was genuinely eco-friendly and free from harsh chemicals. As a busy parent and someone who washes way too many dishes each week, my needs were very specific. For me, using a plant-based detergent that’s both tough on grease and gentle on the environment was worth exploring.  

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  

The cleaning performance is undoubtedly one of the detergent's most impressive features. I loaded my dishwasher with some pretty challenging grime—leftover lasagna residue, sticky scrambled egg bits, and coffee mugs that hadn’t been rinsed out for days. After one cycle, I was pleasantly surprised by sparkling dishes and zero streaks, even on glassware. I didn’t even have to pre-rinse, which for me, is a big win. The formula uses plant-based enzymes to break down residue, and it actually delivered results comparable to other chemical-heavy detergents I've used. It even tackled tough grease stains that usually mock my previous dishwasher gel.  

[Check Seventh Generation 22170CT price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0004jkjs0/)  

**Free of Fragrances and Dyes**  

Some detergents carry strong artificial scents that linger on dishes, which, let's be honest, is a major turnoff, especially when it overwhelms the smell of your food. This detergent impressed me because it’s fragrance-free, meaning there’s no weird soapy smell when you pull your dishes out. Trust me, having forks that actually smell like forks and not some “spring meadow” artificial concoction is life-changing. The fact that it's clear and free of dyes is an added bonus, especially since no one wants their clean bowls stained blue.  

**Eco-Friendly Focus**  

One of the major winning points is its environmentally sound formulation. Being a USDA Certified Biobased Product at 65%, with no phosphates, chlorine, or other harmful ingredients, it ticks all the boxes for a sustainable lifestyle. I felt pretty satisfied knowing that every wash contributes minimally to environmental degradation. Their use of biodegradable ingredients is another aspect that makes you feel like someone is, for once, prioritizing the planet. Paired with their impressive stance as a Certified B Corporation, supporting them feels like a small, meaningful step.  

**Ease of Use**  

The gel consistency worked well for me. It’s easy to measure, pours cleanly without clogging, and doesn’t leave sticky residue behind on the detergent compartment door. Another point worth noting was its compatibility—I used it across different dishwashers, from the ancient one at my mom’s house to the newer, high-tech model I have at home, and it performed consistently well.  

**Positives**  

- Cuts through grease and leaves dishes sparkling clean  
- Made with plant-based, safe ingredients  
- Free of fragrances, chlorine, dyes, and phosphates  
- Biodegradable and better for the environment  
- Consistent cleaning performance across dishwashers  

**Shortcomings**  

To keep it real, there were a couple of areas where the product felt slightly lacking.  

- It doesn’t excel with hard water. In homes with notoriously mineral-heavy water, occasional spotting might occur.  
- If you’re expecting a rich, foamy cycle, this gel won’t give you that satisfaction. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it can throw people accustomed to sudsy dishwashers.  

**Alternative Offerings**  

Brands like Cascade Platinum and Finish Powerball Tabs often come to mind when talking about reliable dishwasher detergents. Cascade, for instance, provides exceptional cleaning power but is laden with chemicals that I try to avoid; something about rinsing chlorine off our dishes doesn’t sit right with me. Finish tabs are harder on persistent grease stains compared to this gel, but they often leave dishes smelling too synthetic and lemon-heavy for my taste. Seventh Generation stands out because it prioritizes health and eco-consciousness without a noticeable compromise in performance, making it a worthy choice for someone who values sustainability.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

In terms of value proposition, it’s worth noting that while this gel may not always match the cost-per-load efficiency of ultra-cheap tablet packs, the superior ingredient list makes it a worthy contender. Knowing that my family isn’t exposed to harsh chemicals and my purchasing choices support an eco-friendlier supply chain makes its slightly higher price point valid. Compared to less environmentally-conscious brands, this detergent delivers peace of mind that cannot be underestimated.

1nihksd,https://v.redd.it/maohh4l74jpf1,Sour shots with new beans + bottomless portafilter [Casabrews CM5417],"Hey everyone,

I recently picked up a bottomless portafilter for my Casabrews CM5418 and I’m running into a problem—my shots keep tasting sour. 

•	Beans: local roaster’s espresso blend (he recommended it, but I don’t know the exact makeup). •	Dose: I’ve tried between 15–17g in. 

•	Yield: pulled shots anywhere from 1:2, 1:2.5, even up to 1:3 ratio in 25-40 seconds depending on the ratio 

•	Taste: always comes out sour. (I know this is subjective, but I’m comparing it to just plain shots I’ve had at coffee shops)

This is my first time using these beans and this portafilter, so I’m not sure if the issue is my grind, technique, or just the beans themselves.

Any advice on dialing this in? Should I be trying longer shots, adjusting grind/tamp, or is it worth picking up a different set of beans to rule that out?

Thanks in advance!",2,1758029471.0,espresso,13,0.75,False

I am 37, raised with diet culture from an early age. Attended weight watchers with my mom at 8 years old. Was counting points in middle school. ""You wouldn't want to go to junior high (8th grade) weighing over 200 pounds would you?"" - my good intentioned mother. 

Hydroxycut. Weight watchers. Atkin's. The special K diet. Slim fast. Jenny Craig. Nutrisystem. Phentermine. One meal a day. Calorie counting. Keto. Paleo. An endless barrage of conflicting theories and unsolicited advice and body commentary. The ""you're doing so great, you look amazing!"" comments turning to silence as the scale creeps back up. I know all of it entirely too well.

25 years of dramatic weight losses and gains later found myself at 372 pounds. Even in my greatest of weight loss successes, a full week without at least one major binge was a rarity.

In 12 days I have not felt the urge to snack. Not had a lingering craving. And not one binge. I have lost 12.5 pounds.

At first I thought there was no way this wasn't placebo effect since I am at the very beginning of building drug levels in my system. Somehow, day after day, I am experiencing food and life in a completely different way. I realized this morning that I haven't had an energy drink in over a week. I do drink a protein coffee every day but previously I was drinking 2 Monster Zeros every single day. I work 12 hour overnight shifts and have relied on monster for as long as I can remember.

I'm averaging 1500-1700 calories a day. 140-180g of protein. 80oz of water. 20-30g of fiber. I know the diet is a huge piece but I've eaten exactly like this many times before and havent seen the scale drop day after day after day since my early 20s.

1nihjsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanExpatsUK/comments/1nihjsn/closing_time_in_the_uk/,Closing Time in the UK,"Something I’ve noticed living in the UK is how differently “closing time” works. In the US, if a place says it closes at 9 PM, you can usually walk in at 8:55 and still get served — “closing” means that’s when they stop serving new customers. In the UK, closing time is when the employees expect to be walking out the door to go home. Restaurants shut their kitchens an hour before the posted time, and grocery stores might even stop letting people in 20–30 minutes before closing.

This caused some frustration my first year here: I’d walk into a café ten minutes before closing, hoping to grab a coffee, only to find the machine already turned off. Or I’d run out to pick up milk or eggs ten minutes before a grocery store’s closing time, only to find they’d stopped letting people in.

1nihjhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nihjhy/delve_into_the_best_single_serve_espresso_machine/,Delve Into the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine Illy Y3.3 Review,"The Illy Y3.3 caught my eye for its compact, sleek design and promise of making high-quality espresso at home. With its striking Amalfi Blue color, this single-serve espresso machine was practically shouting, ""Put me on your kitchen counter!"" Intrigued, I decided to see if it could stand up to the hype of delivering café-level espresso or if it was just another pretty gadget.

**Design and Size**  
What impressed me right off the bat was how compact and modern this machine looked. The Illy Y3.3 seemed perfect for smaller spaces without sacrificing aesthetics. Measuring 11.73"" deep, 6.69"" wide, and 14.96"" tall, it slid easily onto my crowded countertop. Its eye-catching blue color added a bold touch, making it stand out in the sea of ordinary black and silver coffee machines. Despite its lightweight construction (just 7.72 pounds), it feels surprisingly sturdy. I couldn’t help but marvel at how it manages to blend style with functionality effortlessly.

**Usability and Features**  
This espresso machine couldn't get simpler to operate. It has two programmable buttons for brewing options—espresso and drip coffee. Being someone who values minimal morning effort, I appreciated this straightforward setup. The button interface is intuitive and doesn't require a degree in rocket science to figure out. It heats up quickly, delivering your favorite espresso shot or cup of coffee in under a minute—a blessing for my hectic mornings! And let’s talk about the reusable filter type, which shows some attention to environmental concerns while still being easy to clean.

**Favorable Attributes**  

- Compact, modern design fits small kitchen spaces and adds gorgeous visual appeal.
- Heats up quickly, allowing you to enjoy espresso or coffee in less than a minute.
- Exclusive iperEspresso capsule system ensures consistently rich flavors and long-lasting crema.
- Fully automatic operation with a straightforward interface that everyone can understand.  

[Check Illy Y3.3 price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b08ppwfj12/)

**Taste and Brewing Performance**  
The patented iperEspresso capsule system is exclusive to Illy, which is both a strength and a limitation (more on that later). As a coffee enthusiast, what stole my heart was the rich flavor and velvety crema each shot delivered. Over several weeks, every cup I brewed had a consistent and delightful taste. Whether you’re craving an espresso to start your day or a milder drip coffee in the afternoon, this machine nails both options. However, keep in mind it is particularly tailored for customers who are already fans of Illy coffee pods.

**Pitfalls**  

- Only compatible with Illy iperEspresso capsules, limiting flexibility to experiment with other coffee brands.  
- Slightly loud operation for such a small unit might disrupt morning peace.  

**Direct Competitors**  
The Nespresso Essenza Mini comes to mind as a close competitor with its compact design. The Essenza Mini supports Nespresso capsules, which offer a broader range of coffee options than Illy’s system. However, the Y3.3 excels in creating a more refined espresso and crema, in my opinion. On the flip side, if you value variety over brand loyalty and proprietary systems, machines like the Keurig K-Mini offer multi-brand coffee pod compatibility, although they may lose out on delivering authentic espresso richness. In this context, the Y3.3 is ideal for those seeking simplicity combined with premium quality.

**Smart Spending**  
While it leans towards the pricier side compared to its competitors, its high build quality, excellent espresso flavors, and stunning design feel worth the investment for anyone who prioritizes quality over cost. However, if the brand-locked Illy pod system seems too restrictive or you'd like more affordable capsule options, you might want to factor in the long-term expense.

1nihgey,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nihgey/reveal_the_best_espresso_machine_for_home/,Reveal the Best Espresso Machine for Home Baristas DeLonghi Opera,"Testing out the De'Longhi EC9555M La Specialista Opera Espresso Machine felt like stepping into a professional café, except in the comfort of my own kitchen. This espresso machine, packed with advanced features, is definitely designed for serious coffee enthusiasts. I’ve been using it daily for a few weeks now, and it’s given me plenty to talk about. From crafting espressos with crema that would make a barista envious, to experimenting with the cold brew function, this machine has been an absolute game-changer. Of course, it’s not without its quirks, but on the overall scale, it's quite impressive.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about the espresso machine was its sturdy and classy stainless-steel design. It’s not just an appliance — it’s a statement piece for any modern kitchen. The layout of the control panel makes the machine user-friendly. Buttons and dials are intuitively placed, and the general build feels rock-solid. With dimensions of 14 inches deep, 15 inches wide, and 17.5 inches high, it’s not compact, but it doesn’t come off as too bulky either. At 28.1 pounds, there’s some heft, hinting at the durability and quality of materials used.  

**User Experience and Smart Features**  
Operating this espresso machine is straightforward, yet it still thrills me because of its semi-automated features. The built-in burr grinder offers 15 precise grind settings, and that’s where the magic starts. Whether I want a fine grind for authentic espresso or something coarser for an Americano, it nails it every time. The smart tamping technology is nothing short of genius. A simple lever does all the work, ensuring even tamping and a mess-free workspace. It makes me feel like a pro, even though I know the machine is doing most of the heavy lifting.

**Advantages**
- Smart Tamping Technology simplifies the tamping process for consistent results without the mess.
- Built-in burr grinder with 15 precise settings offering versatility for different coffee styles.
- Cold Extraction Technology for ready-to-enjoy cold brew in less than five minutes.
- Adjustable temperature control for optimal brewing and customizable flavor profiles.

[Check De'Longhi EC9555M price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0d1ty3h2j/)  

**Espresso Quality and Steam Wand**  
The 19-bar Italian pump delivers excellent pressure for a perfect shot every single time. One of my favorite things about this machine is how it prepares cold brew within minutes, something I didn’t realize I needed until now. For anyone who loves to experiment, this feature stands out—most espresso machines don't offer such capabilities. The steam wand is another highlight. It’s powerful and heats up quickly, producing microfoam consistently smooth enough for even intricate latte art (I’m slowly getting better at it, though my kids laugh at my attempts at hearts and swirls).  

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**  
This machine stands out in terms of energy efficiency and ease of cleaning. De'Longhi has designed the machine with reusable filters, so there’s no fussing with disposable paper ones. The parts that need cleaning are easy to remove and reassemble. However, as someone who occasionally forgets to refill the water reservoir, I wish it had a more prominent indicator for that. Minor inconvenience but something worth mentioning.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The machine occupies a significant amount of counter space due to its height.
- At 28.1 pounds, it’s not easily portable or convenient to move around.
- While the grinder is excellent, it can be noisy during operation.
- Cold brew temperature consistency could use slight improvement.

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to others in the market, the La Specialista Opera has some standout features like the cold brew function and smart tamping. Machines in the same category, such as Breville Barista Express, offer similar capabilities but lack the cold brew appeal and smart tamping lever. However, Breville’s machine takes up slightly less counter space and operates a bit quieter. On the other hand, Nespresso’s super-automatic machines win on speed and ease but fall short in allowing the kind of control and customization offered here. 

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given its array of features, this espresso machine offers robust value for its price. The inclusion of a high-quality burr grinder, steam wand, cold brew functionality, and programmable settings feels like you’re getting a full coffee bar in one unit. It certainly isn’t cheap, but with its durable build and advanced features, it’s an investment that pays for itself with every delicious cup brewed.

1nihftf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nihftf/explore_best_coffee_makers_keurig_ksupreme_review/,Explore Best Coffee Makers Keurig K-Supreme Review Worth It,"The Keurig K-Supreme coffee maker, model 062151515284, has been occupying a corner of my kitchen for quite some time now, and let me just say this: it’s a coffee lover’s playground—in the best and sometimes the quirkiest of ways. From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell this wasn’t just a standard coffee brewer. Its sleek, modern black design immediately won me over. 

Who wouldn’t want something so stylish parked on their countertop? With its compact dimensions of 7.05 x 17.91 x 14.41 inches, this machine doesn’t scream for attention but subtly integrates into your space. What’s more, the removable 1.95L dual-position water reservoir gives you a level of customization you don’t often find. I found myself having fun deciding where to position it for the best balance between accessibility and counter space. It honestly became a little family debate one morning, yet the fact that it’s removable makes life easy when you need a quick refill.

**Highlights**  
- MultiStream Technology ensures flavorful brews by evenly saturating grounds.  
- Offers brew size flexibility: 6, 8, 10, and 12 oz.  
- The Strong button satisfies anyone craving a bold coffee punch.  

[Check Keurig 062151515284 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08gm76wm8/)

Talking about brewing, this coffee maker has redefined my mornings. The MultiStream Technology is no joke—it genuinely extracts richer flavors and fuller aromas than the classic single-needle Keurig machines. Even my somewhat picky cousin admitted that his morning brew tasted less watered down compared to what he’s used to. I also appreciated the Strong button, which elevates the intensity of the coffee. Is it groundbreaking? Not exactly—but for those days you need a stronger kick, it’s a lifesaver.

A quirky win for me is its iced coffee feature. Brewing hot coffee over ice? Genius. As a regular iced coffee drinker, I found this feature hit the spot, especially during sweltering afternoons. However, let’s be real: if you’re expecting the flavor complexity of artisanal cold brew, that’s not happening here. Still, it’s refreshingly solid for a quick fix. Variety is the name of the game, and this machine plays along beautifully with K-Cups, tea pods, cocoa options, and even ground coffee (if you have the reusable filter, sold separately). I’ve been experimenting with new flavors like never before.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Compact and modern design seamlessly fits in any kitchen.  
- The customizable reservoir adds convenience for small or large countertops.  
- Multi-beverage compatibility, from pods to ground coffee.  
- Travel mug-friendly, perfect for hectic commutes.  

For all its merits, the unit isn’t perfect; there are a few points of contention I’ve noticed after frequent use. Cleaning the internal components, for instance, could be more streamlined. While the reservoir and drip tray are removable and easy to wash, descaling feels cumbersome—though it's necessary every few months to keep the brewer running optimally. On another note, it’s not the quietest machine. Early mornings at my house can sound like a tiny coffee robot is doing some heavy lifting in the kitchen. My light-sleeper roommate often utters muffled objections until her first cup is ready.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Descaling can be time-consuming and is a recurring necessity.  
- The brewing noise might disturb particularly quiet households.  
- Reusable pod filters are not included, which could feel limiting for ground coffee enthusiasts.  

Let’s talk competitors for a moment. Compared to its market rivals like the Nespresso Vertuo and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, it shines in its brew size options and MultiStream Technology. Nespresso, while classy, locks you into its proprietary pods, which are pricier and less versatile. On the flip side, Hamilton Beach caters to both single-serve pod users and 12-cup drip coffee lovers but lacks the flavor consistency that Keurig offers with its advanced saturation tech. Deciding between these options often boils down (pun intended) to what you prioritize: flexibility and flavor depth? The Keurig easily wins.

Regarding cost-effectiveness, this coffee maker strikes a decent balance. While the purchase price may feel a bit hefty compared to no-frills models, the brewing versatility justifies the investment. Using reusable filters for ground coffee, for instance, can save money over time, especially if you’re someone who switches between K-Cups and custom blends. Sure, it’s not the cheapest option out there, but sometimes paying slightly more for convenience and quality feels like smart spending.

1nihag0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1nihag0/is_there_hope_for_reconciliation_or_not/,Is there hope for reconciliation or not?,"Hi everyone,

I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible. I’m coming up on 6 months post-discard with my FA ex, and despite my best efforts, I still feel stuck and unable to fully move on.

I’ve really tried: dating apps, going on dates, picking up new hobbies, renovating my home, and focusing on self-improvement. But he’s still constantly on my mind.

About a month ago, I reached out to him to tell him that I missed him (I made it clear I wasn’t expecting a reply, I just needed to say it). He did respond, and what followed was 1–2 hours of messages where we were laughing, joking, and reminiscing. Below are just a few things he shared:

* “I’m grateful for you, your family and our time. These are memories for a lifetime without any hate, only happiness and fondness.”
* ""I miss you every day and remember our times constantly… Even simple things like making a coffee, cooking something, inbetween sets in the gym or walking past some rachet aldi.""
* ""I remember your messages, your words, your letters and poems, your every effort, your movie nights, our dates, your laugh and smiles, your food and high alcohol intake for non alcoholics."" 
* ""You please do take care of yourself. You deserve the world xxx""
* ""Thank you so much for messaging today""
* “Take care of yourself. Always thinking of you xxxx”
* “That would be so nice to do with you” (in response to me suggesting coffee as friends).
* “I know, I do really miss you too. We impacted each other’s lives in such a profound way.”

This really stirred up all the feelings I’ve been trying to suppress. Two weeks later, I reached out again because I felt like I needed clarity... whether there’s any possibility of reconciliation or not. I asked if we could talk briefly in person or over the phone so I could ask him directly.

His response was that he’s been really busy, and asked if I minded giving him some time to settle down and think before making a decision about meeting or calling. I told him that was fine, that he owed me nothing, and to take as much time as he needed. He read the message… but hasn’t replied. It’s now been two weeks of silence.

My questions are:

* Should I take this as him avoiding the situation entirely?
* Is there a chance he’ll respond at some point, maybe around my birthday (October 10th), or should I stop expecting anything?
* Most importantly: how do I get real closure if he doesn’t give me an answer?

Please be kind in your responses. I know people will say “just move on and find closure within yourself,” and I promise you, I am trying. But I’m still very much in love with him, and I don’t know how to let go of the hope if there’s no chance of him coming back.

Writers tend to treat it as a marketing megaphone: “Here’s my book cover! Here’s me pretending to drink coffee while text floats above my head! Please validate me with a preorder.” 

Meanwhile, readers are using TikTok like it’s a confessional booth with an algorithmic priest—dumping emotions about books they actually loved, or crying in their cars because a fictional man didn’t text back.

It’s a mismatch worthy of a sitcom. Writers are busy screaming “Buy my book!” in polished, awkward thirty-second clips, while readers are busy filming themselves ugly-crying over chapter 17 of some series no one had heard of two weeks ago. The algorithm rewards the crying, not the pitch. Which means the readers end up running the show, while the writers are outside, desperately refreshing views on their “funny author skit” that got 37 likes, half from relatives.

I once tried a trend. You know the ones...point at corners of the screen while captions appear, pretending I can dance. It took me three hours and mild spinal damage to film fifteen seconds of content. The result? TikTok generously showed it to about 42 people, most of whom were bots selling crypto. Meanwhile, a random reader stitched a blurry video of my book cover while whispering “this ruined my life” and got 120,000 views overnight. If irony were currency, I’d be a billionaire.

What readers get right is honesty. They don’t care about lighting or captions...they care about the visceral meltdown they had at 2 a.m. That rawness is gold on TikTok. Writers, on the other hand, are cursed with the need to curate. We polish, rehearse, adjust fonts, and then wonder why it sinks. Readers just sob into the camera, and the algorithm practically carries them on a throne.

So now, I treat TikTok less like a marketplace and more like a lab. I watch what readers actually do—how they frame their emotions, how they highlight tropes, how they tag communities—and I stop pretending I can out-dance Gen Z. 

The best use of TikTok for me isn’t to scream into the void, it’s to eavesdrop on what makes readers tick. That’s data I can actually use when I sit back down to write.

At the end of the day, TikTok isn’t an author’s playground—it’s the readers’ coliseum. 

We’re lucky if we get to pitch a tent outside and wave at the crowd. And maybe that’s fine. Because the lesson is darkly funny but freeing: no one is buying your book because you nailed a trending audio. They’re buying it because some reader lost sleep over it and recorded themselves crying. 

The best move? Write something worth crying about. Let the readers do the heavy lifting while you try not to dislocate a hip learning transitions.",1,1758028570.0,u_BurntEdgePublishing,0,1.0,False

1nih6p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1nih6p7/im_38_and_finally_cracked_the_discipline_code/,I'm 38 and finally cracked the discipline code after failing for 15+ years. Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every program, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

The only thing that helped was that damn quiz some guy on reddit recommended to me (this one - [StopSocial](https://stopsocial.today/)). It told me I will spend 8 years of my life scrolling social media so I had to make some drastic changes. I journal through it currently and my screen time reduced from around 4-5 hours per day to 1 hour so I'd recommend it to those struggling like I did.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

1nih4zc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nih4zc,Is this a new (insanely flawed) lid for cold drinks??? Aka: i feel like my local starbucks is trying to sabotage me lol,"Rant! But first- i understand how stressful bejng a barista can be, especially in the mornjng rush. I worked at starbucks forever ago…so i get it.
That being said! I swear, my starbucks i frequent since its right on the way to work messes my orders up spectacularly, at least once a week. 

The first time i ordered my usual (hot americano with oatmilk and hazelnut) and was in the drive thru. When the barista handed me the drink, it was the wrong one, for someone else….like he said someone else’s name, i said no that isnt me, and then he noticed the error. So they remade my drink. It took ages, to the point of people honking behind me! He handed it off to me, but the lid was not on completely…like 25% pressed on. So when i took a sip, almost all the coffee goes all over me, my clothes i was wearing to work, on my first week at my new job mind you! I had clean scrubs and did a decent amount of makeup to look nice…all ruined. I reached out to a customer service representative and they said they could comp my drink- and that is it. I swear i am not a “karen”! But i felt something needed to be said because jesus christ! 

Now TODAY! I ordered my usual. When i went to pickup my drink in the drive thru, the drink was iced, not hot. I asked if she was sure that was mine, and she said yeah, looked at the label that clearly did not say iced, and said i could pull around and they can remake it, i said no bc i did not have time to wait. Whatever…annoying but not the end of the world. I went to take a sip, and got coffee all over me AGAIN, Bc there were two holes on the top of the lid. If you look at the picture i posted you can see what i mean. I just sipped from the top hole- as i didn’t notice the other one as i was focused in my driving. 

Does anyone know who i can talk to about this? Its almost comical the amount of incorrect drinks and spilled coffee i have dealt with for this starbucks. First world problems i know…but at some point i am going to start thinking they just dont like me and mess up my drinks in purpose. ALSO! i tip one dollar each order, if that has any relevance.

1nih4z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1nih4z6/explore_best_coffee_espresso_machine_nespresso/,Explore Best Coffee Espresso Machine Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Review Worth Reading,"Delving into the world of single-serve coffee makers, I had the chance to explore the Nespresso ENV92B and form my thoughts on it. This coffee and espresso machine, also known as the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+, immediately stood out to me due to its compact and quirky design paired with a highly functional brewing system. As someone who’s particular about their morning coffee, the promise of barista-style beverages tailored to numerous preferences was too enticing to pass up. While I genuinely appreciate most of what this machine offers, there are certain aspects that left me pondering.

**Design: Sleek and Space-Saving Elegance**  
This machine not only delivers coffee but adds a touch of contemporary style to your kitchen. The compact design is a visual delight and fits effortlessly in smaller spaces. Measuring just 14"" by 8.6"" by 10.4"", I could easily place it near my toaster without feeling like my countertop space was compromised. Its Liquorice Black color is striking yet subtle enough to blend into a variety of aesthetics. One of my favorite aspects of its design is the side-accessible removable water tank, which holds 25 fl. oz—it’s a game-changer for easy refilling.

**Features: Key Benefits**  
- Offers five coffee options: espresso, double espresso, iced coffee, Gran Lungo, and XL coffee.  
- Lightweight at just under seven pounds, making it portable enough to shift around if needed.  
- A rapid 30-second heat-up time ensures a quick cup even on rushed mornings.  
- Uses the Centrifusion technology to read barcodes on Nespresso capsules, ensuring precision brewing every single time.

[Check Nespresso ENV92B price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b0dvd67f76/)

**Performance: Brewing to Impress**  
Testing it every morning with different capsules made me realize just how effortlessly this machine delivers consistent results. The precision brewing system produces coffee with a rich aroma, a smooth, full-bodied flavor, and that signature velvety crema on top that I’ve come to associate with top-notch brewing. Whether I needed a quick espresso shot to jolt myself awake or a leisurely iced coffee to enjoy on a sunny afternoon, this gadget handled it all effortlessly. Plus, the complimentary sampler set from Nespresso allowed me to experiment with over 40 permanent specialty Vertuo coffee flavors—it felt like being given the keys to a world of exotic coffee adventures.

**Sustainability: Boons for Eco-Conscious Users**  
If you’re environmentally conscious like I am, this part will definitely warm your heart. The aluminum capsules used are fully recyclable, and Nespresso even offers a free recycling program. Additionally, the machine itself is partially constructed using 35% recycled plastic. It’s great knowing that this blend of style and performance also aligns with sustainability.

**Pitfalls**  
- The machine uses proprietary capsules, which means you’re tied down to purchasing only Nespresso capsules. It’s a tad limiting for those who might want to venture out into other brands.  
- The 25 fl. oz water tank, though convenient in design, might require more frequent refills if your usage is high.  
- A bit of noise during brewing can be disruptive in a quiet morning setting.  

**Competitive Options in the Market**  
Comparing the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ against competitors like the Keurig K-Supreme Plus and the Breville Barista Pro has been an insightful experience. While Keurig offers more universal compatibility when it comes to coffee pods, it lacks the sophisticated capsule technology that Nespresso utilizes for precision brewing. Breville, on the other hand, caters to those who adore the traditional espresso-making process with a more hands-on approach, including a built-in grinder. However, the Vertuo Pop+ wins with its compact size, modern aesthetics, and ease of operation—perfect for anyone seeking a highly efficient solution.

**Cost-Effectiveness: Is It Worth It?**  
The price for what this machine offers is hard to argue with. Between the premium feel, the consistency in performance, and the innovative features like App-controlled updates and Centrifusion brewing, it strikes a delicate balance of luxury and practicality. While it might feel like an investment upfront, the ability to recreate café-style beverages at home without needing to spend at coffee shops consistently offsets the initial price.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

If you’re in the market for a reliable, built-in ice maker, this sleek and compact device does its job admirably, but it isn’t without its quirks. Here’s a breakdown of my personal experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Every time I walk past this ice maker, I can’t help but appreciate its stainless steel exterior. The material not only oozes durability but also blends well with my other appliances. Measuring 22.5 x 15 x 33.5 inches, it slides seamlessly into my bar area without taking up too much space. The handle, running the full length of the door, makes opening it feel sturdy and ergonomic. That said, it’s a bit hefty at 115 pounds, so installation took a bit of maneuvering. It’s not quite something you can quickly reposition on a whim.

**Performance and Ice Production**  
This ice maker seriously delivers when it comes to production. It can churn out an impressive 51 pounds of ice in a 24-hour period under optimal conditions. Whether hosting a weekend party or just making extra for the week, the output never left me hanging. The 22-pound built-in storage capacity ensures I’m not constantly grabbing for extra bags of ice at the grocery store. It produces top hat-style ice cubes, which are elegant enough for cocktails or simply upping the quality of my iced coffee game. However, on days when temperatures soared in my kitchen, the production slightly dipped—though it was still respectable overall.  

**Check Hoshizaki AM-50BAJ price on Amazon.**  

**Energy Efficiency and Cooling System**  
The self-contained condenser and air-cooled system offer solid energy efficiency. One feature I particularly liked is the single-phase, 115v/60/1 setup, which meant I could use it with standard outlets without needing any electrical modifications. I noticed it runs relatively quietly, which was a pleasant surprise given the assumption that ice makers can be noisy. Still, don’t expect it to be completely silent; there’s a gentle hum during operation that fades into the background after a while.

**Key Benefits**  
— Strong ice production even during intensive use  
— Compact design perfect for tight spaces  
— Produces elegant top hat-style cubes  

**Areas for Improvement**  
— Installation can be tricky due to its heavy build  
— Ice production slightly slows in warmer environments  

**Outdoor Compatibility**  
I set up the Hoshizaki ice maker outdoors for one of my barbecues, and the UL rating for outdoor use really came in handy. Despite being placed on a semi-covered patio, it handled the environment like a champ. This adaptability makes it a fantastic option for outdoor kitchens or patios. Just make sure it has reasonable shelter from direct exposure because while it’s tough, it’s not invincible.

**Competing Products**  
When I was researching ice makers, I compared this model to others like the GE Profile Opal and the Scotsman CU50GA. The GE Opal stood out for its ability to produce nugget ice—a feature that definitely had my curiosity. However, the smaller storage capacity didn’t align well with my larger ice needs. The Scotsman CU50GA, on the other hand, offered similar storage but came with a steeper price tag. Ultimately, I felt the balance of price, production, and build quality made the Hoshizaki the most sensible choice for my needs.

**Smart Spending**  
This ice maker leans toward the premium end of the spectrum, but the quality matches the price tag. Consider this a worthwhile investment if you entertain frequently or consume a lot of ice in your day-to-day. Compared to cheaper models, you’re paying for durability, consistency, and an elegant design. It might not be the cheapest out there, but the long-term reliability justifies the price in my experience.

1nigzbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nigzbs/why_choose_brondell_uc300_water_filtration_system/,Why Choose Brondell UC300 Water Filtration System Review for Cleaner Drinking Water?,"I’ve had the Brondell UC300 water filtration system in my kitchen for several weeks now, and it’s been an illuminating experience. Getting clean, fresh-tasting water straight from the tap has never felt this seamless. Known officially as the Brondell H2O+ Coral UC300 Three-Stage Undercounter Water Filtration System, this under-sink filter system caught my eye for its promise of removing contaminants while retaining beneficial minerals. That’s a bold claim, but does it deliver? Yes, mostly! However, there are nuances worth discussing.

**Design and Installation Simplicity**  
Aesthetically, the device adopts a clean, minimalist design that doesn’t clash with your kitchen’s decor. It’s the kind of equipment you’d expect to tuck away, but even if someone happened to peek beneath my sink, it wouldn’t look out of place. Measuring just 2.5 inches in depth, 7.5 inches in width, and 12 inches in height, its compactness is truly impressive. Installation, I’ll admit, was a breeze. The DIY-friendly twist-and-seal mechanism had me up and running in no time, and that’s coming from someone who still struggles with IKEA furniture!

One nifty feature is the change-indicator light, which alerts you when it’s time to replace the filters. At its core, the system includes three primary filters: a sediment filter, pre-carbon filter, and carbon block filter. Together, they tackle physical particles like rust and sand, chemical contaminants like VOCs and chlorine, and even biological impurities. Setting all this up felt like an accomplishment – not too technical, not too simplistic.  

[Find the best price for Brondell UC300 on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b015i0a06a/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
After the initial flush, I noticed an immediate change in taste and clarity. My morning coffee tasted crisper, and that chlorine aftertaste from my municipal water was gone. What sets this system apart is its advanced three-stage filtration. The sediment filter first kicks into action, reducing any visible gunk. Next, the carbon pre-filter neutralizes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) – good riddance! Finally, the carbon block filter handles heavy metals and any lingering odd flavors or odors. To me, the water feels “natural” — devoid of unpleasant flavors but not overly stripped to the point where it feels sterile.  

**Key Benefits**  
- The unit employs a triple-stage filtration method, ensuring not just clarity but a richer taste in your water.  
- Compact build and a DIY-friendly installation process save time (and money if you’re avoiding plumbers).  
- Filter replacements are straightforward and practical, with the light indicator acting as a helpful reminder.  

**Minus Points**  
- While the filters offer long-lasting performance (up to a year), replacements can lean toward being pricey compared to other brands.  
- It doesn’t soften hard water, so if minerals contribute to your dishwashing woes, this might not be the all-in-one solution you’re after.  

**User Suitability: Who Will Love It?**  
I think anyone with a small family or single household looking to improve their water quality would find this a worthwhile investment. Frequent tea and coffee drinkers, like myself, especially enjoy the enhanced flavor. While it’s marketed primarily for urban tap water users, those relying on well water might find limited utility here since it doesn’t deal with bacterial or extreme mineral issues unique to those systems.

**Other Options That Rival This System**  
In the realm of under-sink water filtration, competing systems like the Aquasana AQ-5200 have their own merits. The Aquasana, for instance, boasts NSF certification for reducing over 70 contaminants, but its bulkier size makes installation less seamless compared to the UC300. On the flip side, the APEC WFS-1000 is another strong contender; however, it lacks the three-stage filtration finesse that the Brondell model offers. Both competitors also skip the neat filter-replacement indicator that continually keeps you in the know. Between them, the UC300 still feels like a small luxury for those prioritizing form and function.

**Financial Value and Price Worthiness**  
Filter systems like these aren’t exact “penny savers” upfront, but in the grander scheme of things, they save you from bottled water expenses while keeping microplastics out of your diet. For the quality of the materials used (filters meet ANSI, NSF, WQA, and CSA certifications), the price doesn’t feel unwarranted. However, I’d love to see Brondell bundle in a year’s worth of replacement filters to sweeten the deal for first-time buyers.

1nigyr7,https://i.redd.it/buvwn21tzipf1.jpeg,How I manage to study 6-7 hours daily,"As I started to study every day for the past 9 months I recognized some small tips that you significantly improve your focus and energy while studying 

Here are some methods that helped me: 

**Sleep** every day at the same bedtime, the room should be if possible completely dark and have a cool temperature. 
 
**Drink Water!** if you´re not Hydrated well enough your brain isn´t functioning optimally. 

According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine: For men: 3.7 liters and for women 2.7 liters. 

Try to get 10-15 mins of **morning sunlight** (even through a window), if possible combine that with a quick walk outside to clear your head and get the blood pumping. 

**Stretch and rotate your Neck** 

Do **shoulder rolls**, forward and backwards to release tention. 

**FIX. YOUR. POSTURE** 

Hunching kills blood flow to your brain and gives you neck ache. Get yourself a standing desk / Laptop stand + decent chair + consciously sitting/standing taller 

Try to do 30 secs of **cold** at the end of your normal **shower**. The energy you get from that is INSANE. 

Try to swap Coffee for** Green Tea + L-Theanine**The energy you get from it feels much calmer and more focused. 

Try Box Breathing (calming & safe): 

Inhale for 4 seconds 

Hold your breath for 4 seconds 

Exhale slowly for 4 seconds 

Hold again for 4 seconds 

Repeat for 2–5 minutes. It’s great for calming your nervous system and regaining control. 

**Chew gum** 

Sounds fake, but it surprisingly works for studying/deep work. Supposedly increases blood flow to the brain. 

**Grayscale your phone** use blockers** and turn your **notifications off** while studying; Should be self-explanatory. 

If anyone´s interested I can also make another Post about the supplements I use. 

Studying techniques I use: Pomodoro, Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, ""Explain it to a 5-Year-Old"": Comment if you need more information about those techniques, I'm down to share! 
 
Don't Forget You're a Human: 

This sounds obvious, but it's the foundation for everything else. I had to force myself to realize that an all-nighter is almost never the answer. A good night's sleep does more for my memory and problem-solving skills than 3 extra hours of frantic, late-night cramming.

1nigxpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nigxpg/got_kicked_out_from_my_colleagues_rentall_in_a/,Got kicked out from my colleagues rentall in a new country for asking some queastions!,"So this is my friend who recently got a job in brussels, she lived in sweden before. Its a 6 months work, not good paying but more for the experience. My friend (F, 24) contacted her when she heard that she rented a room with her, a small room and there is 1 toilet to share. and they came to an agreement in 6 months and the host offered it for 500 euros at first but then reduced it to 450 euros with no negotiating from my friends side (this is in a message conversation but in danish!). she trusted the colleague and no contract was signed. F is allergic of cats but said before that she would fix it with some medicin and didnt mind the cats at all, but when she arrived to the appartment she realized the cats wasnt there and asked the host about it, and tho host said she took them over to her boyfriends and even thogh my friend insisted on keeping the cats at the appartment and that the host should do what she(the host) wanted in her own home, but the host insisted on the cats being at her boyfriends. Everything seemed great, they went out to a restaurant the first week and had a great time and my friend always asked permision about things, for example the first week she asked the host if it was okay if her friend could come over and sleep over when the host is not home (the host is not in Brussels every other week), and the host said ""you will feel at home here, don't think that you are renting a room but living here"". The host had also said before that they could take payment on the spot and that no deposit was needed. Suddenly she gets an email from the host that she doesn't feel comfortable and other things that are not reasonable. Now my friend is searching for another accommodation, however, it is incredibly difficult to find new accommodation at such short notice in a country she doesn't know and doesn't have friends or family in the area.

  
first mail:   
Hi!  
I am really sorry to have to write to you but I am very bad a setting my boundaries and communicating on delicate matters.  
   
I hate making people sad and disappointed but at a point I have to think of my own well-being and I am feeling very unwell and no longer at ease in my own home.  
   
It is a risk to rent out a room to a person you don’t know but I felt confident it could work well because you are a trainee at same workplace and we both come from Nordic countries.  
   
Nevertheless, what I have felt from the start is the Danish expression, you give a finger and the other person takes your whole arm.  
   
First I told you the rent was 500 EUR and you negotiated it to be 450 EUR. You can check anywhere in Brussels, rooms with charges including are rented from 500-750 EUR or more. I was aware my rent was very low but also thought that my apartment is not ideal because you don’t have your own bathroom etc. so I agreed to a low rent.  
   
Then I picked you up from the airport etc. and you quickly asked me if you could pay the rent AFTER you have been paid by workplace. I was surprised by the question and accepted even though I really find it impolite not to pay your rent in advance.  
Nobody in Brussels (or elsewhere) would accept to rent out a room without receiving the rent in advance and normally, in Brussels, you also have to pay a deposit (garanti) of 1 month extra rent, which you recover at the end of the rental period. This extra month is to cover eventual damage the renter would do. I never asked for that neither.  
I felt that my kindness was abused by not paying me the rent but it is difficult for me to say no, when people ask me something in a kind way.  
   
Then there was the transport issue to ...workplace.. I felt that you expected me to include transport cost (driving you to from workplace on daily basis for free) and it was unpleasant for me to have to inform you that I actually bike all the time. We joked about it and I was kind enough to lend you my good VTT bike and trust that you would treat it well.  
I took a risk in the sense my bike could easily be stolen if you park it a wrong place etc. Bikes are stolen every day in Brussels. It was thus a big sign of trust from my side to lend you my bike.  
You didn’t like biking on a normal bike and wanted an electrical bike, which you have now solved yourself (which is great).  
   
Fairly quickly after arriving to my apartment you started talking about inviting your family members to my apartment (sisters etc.) who would come and sleep in my apartment before going on trips to france etc.  
I actually find it way over the limit to ask for that. ☹  
   
We didn’t know each other, you pay a very low rent, you rent a room (not an apartment) and you had not even paid your rent yet when you asked if you could basically use my apartment as a free hotel for family and friends wanting to visit you.  
I felt again obliged to say yes, but this is really not ok with me. I find it way above the limit of normal courtesy to ask for that.  
Now today, you asked if  a trainee who has her own place to live, can come and sleep over at my apartment so that I can also drive her (for free) to work on 1st of the month.  
   
You ask if it is ok to invite friends over for diner at my place and maybe it would if we had known each other longer, but I find it very early to invite people to my place. You have hardly arrived in my apartment before you started wanting to invite people over for dinner and sleep over.  
   
It is not an apartment that you rent, it is a room in another persons apartment where I have my personal belongings. I don’t want to be roped, I don’t like that people I don’t know can come and go in my apartment and possibly take things while they are there (and I am absent). It makes me feel very stressed and no longer feel well in my own home.  
   
It feels to me like loosing my key in the street and anyone can just walk into my apartment and potentially rob it. I no longer feel secure in my own home because of this and I sleep very badly.  
   
Since you arrived, you have also found it normal to use my coffee, tea, washing products, olive oil, etc., which would be kind of ok if I felt respected in all other areas but I think with such a low rent as the one you pay, it is also going above limits to use my things. The low rent doesn’t include using all the things there are in my kitchen, otherwise, there is really no income for me at all in renting out a room.  
   
You probably don’t realise that you pay a very low rent, that barely covers what you would pay for charges in other places.  
   
You have started dating apps since the day you arrived in Brussels and I feel very at unease with the idea you might take home an unknown man to my apartment while I am  away on holiday. I honestly didn’t expect that kind of situation.  
   
You are a sweet and charming person and I don’t like to have to set my limits, but you have bypassed my limits multiple times in the past 2 weeks and I don’t feel comfortable with us living together anymore.  
   
I thought perhaps we can try and live together until Christmas and then you find another arrangement but now that you are asking to bring home people to my apartment and that I no longer feel safe that you would potentially bring home people to sleep over at my apartment when I am away, I cannot live like this for several months.  
   
I know it is unpleasant for you to have to find quickly another place to live but there are lots of AirB&Bs now adays and perhaps now that you live in Brussels and meet other trainees who can give you advice, it is easier for you than when you were in Sweden.  
   
Please find another place to live from 30th September.  
    
I am really sorry and I know this is an uncomfortable situation as we still need to live together until end of September.  
   
No hard feelings from my side, I think you don’t do this on purpose, you are not used to how things are in Brussels but for me it has been unpleasant to have to accept things that I don’t find acceptable.  
   
I prefer to live with less money than to rent out a room for the future.  
   
Sorry about it all and let’s try to have a nice atmosphere between us despite this.  
   
I am not telling anybody at work about this situation and I know you already have a hard time with (a colleage).  
   
You can trust that I keep this to myself.  
   
Take care,

AFTER THE FIRST MAIL THEY TALKED TO TRY AND RESOLEVE THINGS AND THE MISSUNDERSTANDINGS. THE DAY AFTER SHE GOT ANOTHER MAIL.  
  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
SECOND MAIL:  
HI!  
Indeed, I am sorry that I had to write it to you, it is always better with a talk person to person, but I am quite bad at that kind of situation, it makes me feel very uncomfortable.  
   
It is good that we had a long talk yesterday after work.  
   
Nevertheless, I have not changed my mind, I don’t feel comfortable or happy living together. It is an accumulation of not feeling respected, a lack of humble behaviour from your side (when you arrive somewhere and move in to another person’s home).  
   
It is also a mistake from my side, because my apartment is not very suitable for hosting another person as there is only one toilet, bathroom etc. It makes living together a family matter.  
   
You are a cheerful and nice young person and I am sure you have tried to do your best and you have always asked me things, rather than just doing them, which I appreciate.  
   
Culturally and generationally speaking though, it has not been nice for me when you constantly ask me for things/permissions, which I don’t find appropriate. It is difficult to say no when asked nicely, but as I said there are really things one should not ask for and particularly, not when one has just arrived in another person’s apartment.  
Building up trust and a good atmosphere take time and in order to have trust in another person, some “rules of good behaviour” should be respected.  
   
For me these rules would be:  
When a landlord picks you up in airport, gives you a nice clean room with all the comfort you can expect, it is not polite to insist on going to IKEA for more “bojler” and mirror particularly given that I had a flat tire (which I got picking you up) It is not a good start to a new relationship, to immediately ask for more…. (I tell you this so you don’t do it again somewhere else). When you arrive a new place, keep a low profile in the beginning.  
You rented a room, not a whole apartment. Of course, you are welcome in the kitchen, bathroom and living room but you are a guest there. Guests don’t change the way the curtains are, they don’t start putting the landlords personal belongings such as my knitting into a cupboard I never use, making it unpleasant for me because I couldn’t find my things. It made me feel, I am no longer home in my own home.  
You don’t ask a landlord if you can invite family and friends over to stay sleeping, particularly when you have just arrived. It’s really a no go.  
  
Since the start you have shown me that you are confused and keep forgetting things, like this morning not finding hearphones, coming back to the apartment after leaving. Paying attention to your things, paying attention to switching off light in rooms where you are not (you systematically left the light on in the bathroom) and closing doors behind you the door to your own room (not to have the cats sleeping on your bed), it is part of paying attention to other people (and cats). Writing to me when I am on holiday to ask me where my car keys were, it really made me feel very uncomfortable on my holiday. It made me wonder if you would be so impolite to use my car in my absence or even if it was just to go and see if you forgot your badge in my car, it made me feel worried. You are a person who forgets a lot of stuff all the time and when we drove together to work, you didn’t close the car doors correctly twice. If I am on holiday and you go to my car to look for a badge and forget to close the door correctly and my car gets stolen, the car insurance doesn’t cover if they can prove a car was unlocked. If the car gets stolen and found again by the police, a report is made. If there is no sign of breaking into the car and it is damaged, my insurance company will not cover the damage… I am sure there are lots of things you don’t think about because you have never owned a car but having a car is a big responsibility and it can cost a lot of money if one forgets to lock the car properly. I don’t want any person to use my car in my absence, neither to go and look for things in my car in my absence. Asking me for this during my leave ruined my day. Again it seems, you lack what I would call “situationsfornemmelse” a sense of what you do and what you don’t do. What you can ask for and what to avoid asking for. Being responsible for your belongings, not loosing them, not constantly forgetting where you put them – it is your responsibility, not your landlords.  
   
When a trust is broken, when I feel that a person is not behaving in a way that makes me feel safe in my own home. When I doubt whether you would invite an unknown man to my home in my absence or use my apartment as an AirB&B for friends and family while I am on holiday, it makes me feel very uncomfortable about leaving my home to you.  
   
Proposing to install a camera so that I would watch over my apartment while being a way is not a solution. Do you think I have time to spend my day looking at a camera to be sure nobody unwished come to my home in my absence? I understand you seek for solutions but this is crazy.  
   
Taking you to work with my car on 1st of the month is a favour that I grant you because we work the same place.   
  
When a person is generous and treats you well, appreciate it and stay humble. Don’t think, this person is kind, I can thus ask for more. If I ask then I am polite.  
   
Sometimes, one has to just value what one gets and not constantly ask for more and more.  
   
Being humble, grateful and polite are the ways to gain other peoples trust and good will.  
   
My trust has gone and I feel uncomfortable living together in those conditions. It is not a question of money, it is a question of boundaries. When people have gone over my limit, my boundaries, I cannot come back to what I felt at first. If I feel abused, then I back out of a relationship whether it is with a man or girl.  
   
I really want you to move out as soon as possible either 30th September ideally, or at latest mid October.  
   
With nowadays AirB&B’s, it is always possible to find something. Probably more expensive than my room but it would be best for both of us, not to live together anymore.  
   
In the meantime, please pay attention to the front door, I don’t want to loose my cats due to inattention and don’t bring anybody to my home.  
   
Thank you.  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
The ikea situations that was mentioned was more like: my friend asked if there where any clothhangers that the host didnt use, and the hosted replied by saying that she hade none but she herself needed some stuff in ikea so they could go there together.  
  
The car was never stolen, its just a situations that the host gave an exampel for if it wasnt so clear in the mail.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   
  
Are the host unreasonable or are my friend in the wrong?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I need to explain something first. My husband's best friend wasn't just some random guy. He was his younger brother. They're only two years apart and they've been inseparable their whole lives. When my husband proposed, of course his brother was going to be the best man.

The wedding was perfect. Everything I'd dreamed about since I was little. Beautiful venue, gorgeous dress, all our friends and family there. My husband looked so handsome waiting for me at the altar. His brother stood right beside him, holding the rings.

During the reception, I'd had maybe four glasses of champagne. Not drunk, but definitely feeling loose. Happy. My new brother-in-law kept refilling my glass and making these jokes about how his brother better treat me right or he'd steal me away. Everyone laughed. It seemed harmless.

""You look incredible,"" he told me when we were alone by the bar. ""My brother's a lucky man.""

""Thanks,"" I said. ""You clean up pretty good yourself.""

""Dance with me?""

""I should find your brother.""

""One dance. Come on, we're family now.""

So we danced. Just one song. Then another. His hand on my lower back, pulling me closer. I could smell his cologne. Feel his breath on my neck.

""We should stop,"" I whispered.

""Yeah,"" he agreed. But neither of us moved away.

I don't know who suggested the coat closet. Maybe him. Maybe me. But suddenly we were there, in the dark, his hands in my hair, kissing me like I wasn't wearing a wedding dress. Like I hadn't just promised to love his brother forever two hours ago.

The door opened. Light flooded in. My sister-in-law stood there, mouth hanging open, staring at us. At me, in my wedding dress, pressed against her other brother.

""What the hell?""

She slammed the door and left. My brother-in-law straightened his tie and walked out without a word. I fixed my lipstick with shaking hands and went back to my reception. Pretended nothing happened. Smiled for photos. Cut the cake. Had my first dance with my actual husband.

My sister-in-law never said anything. Not that night. Not ever. She'd look at me sometimes at family dinners with this expression I couldn't read. But she kept quiet.

I told myself it meant nothing. Just wedding jitters. Cold feet. Too much champagne. I loved my husband. We bought a house. Had three kids. Built a life.

But I couldn't stop thinking about that closet. About his hands. His mouth. The way he looked at me.

We started texting. Nothing serious at first. Just memes. Jokes. How are the kids. Normal family stuff. Then late night conversations. Then pictures. Then meeting for coffee when my husband was at work.

""This is wrong,"" I'd say.

""I know,"" he'd agree.

But we kept meeting. Kept talking. Kept pretending it was innocent.

The first time we slept together was three months after the wedding. In his apartment. On his couch. I told my husband I was at my mom's. He believed me. Why wouldn't he? I was his wife. The mother of his children.

We were careful. Really careful. For twelve years, we managed to hide it. Hotel rooms paid in cash. Fake work conferences. Ladies nights that never happened. I became an expert at lying. At coming home and kissing my husband like I hadn't just been with his brother. At sitting across from my brother-in-law at Thanksgiving and passing him the potatoes like he wasn't the reason I'd been late.

I convinced myself it wasn't really cheating. Not really. We loved each other. We couldn't help it. These things happen. My husband was happy. The kids were happy. No one was getting hurt.

Last month, my sister-in-law finally broke.

We were at her daughter's birthday party. Kids everywhere. Cake and balloons. Normal family stuff. She pulled me aside in the kitchen.

""I can't do this anymore,"" she said.

""Do what?""

""Pretend I don't know what you've been doing. What you did at your own wedding.""

""That was twelve years ago. It was nothing.""

""Nothing? You're still sleeping with him. Don't lie to me. I've seen the texts on his phone. The hotel charges. I've known this whole time.""

My stomach dropped. ""You don't understand.""

""I understand perfectly. You're a cheater. And you've made me complicit by staying quiet. But I'm done protecting you.""

She told my husband that night. Showed him screenshots. Bank records. Everything her brother had been sloppy enough to leave around. Twelve years of evidence.

My husband didn't yell. Didn't cry. Just looked at me and said, ""Our whole marriage is a lie.""

""It's not like that,"" I said. ""It just happened. We couldn't control it.""

""At our wedding?""

""That was just a kiss. And it was so long ago. Why are you living in the past?""

Wrong thing to say. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

""Living in the past? You've been sleeping with my brother our entire marriage and I'm living in the past?""

He moved out that night. Took the kids. They wouldn't even look at me.

My oldest, she's sixteen now. Old enough to understand. She found out everything from her cousins. Kids are brutal with gossip.

""You're disgusting,"" she told me. ""A liar. How could you do that to Dad? To us?""

""Sweetie, you don't understand. Adult relationships are complicated.""

""No, they're not. You promised to love Dad. You lied. You're a cheater and a liar and I hate you.""

My husband filed for divorce last week. Wants full custody. His whole family has cut me off. Twelve years of holidays, birthdays, sunday dinners. Gone. My brother-in-law won't return my calls. Says he needs to fix things with his brother. That we should have stopped years ago.

My own family is disgusted. My mom won't even let me stay with her. Says she didn't raise me to be this kind of person.

I'm living in a studio apartment now. Eating takeout alone. Watching my old life blow up on social media. All our mutual friends picking sides. Spoiler: they're not picking mine.

But I keep thinking about what my husband said. That I ruined everything. That I destroyed our family. And I want to scream that it's not fair. That love is messy. That you can't control who you fall for. That he's being dramatic about something that started over a decade ago.

I made mistakes. I know that. But throwing away thirteen years of marriage over this? Taking my kids? Turning everyone against me? Making me out to be some kind of monster?

AITA for telling him to stop living in the past when it all started so long ago?

1nigu5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CruisePlanningTips/comments/1nigu5v/the_great_debate_are_cruise_drink_packages_worth/,The great debate: Are cruise drink packages worth the money? Let's break it down. 🍹,"Hey r/Cruises,

It’s the million-dollar question every cruiser asks: ""Should I get the drink package?"" The answer is... it depends! Let's do some quick math to see if it's right for you.

**TL;DR: A cruise drink package is generally worth it if you plan to drink 5-7 alcoholic beverages per day, every day of your cruise. It's also worth it for the convenience of not worrying about the bill. If you're a light drinker, it's almost never worth the cost.**

**Here's the Simple Breakdown:**

1. **Find the Cost:** The drink package price is per person, per day. Let's say it's **$80/day**. (Note: If one adult in a cabin buys it, usually all other adults in the same cabin must buy it too).
2. **Find the ""Breakeven"" Point:** Check the average drink prices on your cruise line.
   * Beer: \~$8
   * Wine by the glass: \~$12
   * Cocktail: \~$14
   * Specialty Coffee: \~$5
   * Soda/Bottled Water: \~$4
3. **Do the Math:** At these prices, you would need to drink about **6 cocktails per day** ($14 x 6 = $84) just to break even on the alcohol. This doesn't even include sodas, coffees, or waters you might also consume.

**So, is it worth it for YOU?**

* **YES, if:** You enjoy multiple cocktails by the pool, wine with dinner, a pre-dinner drink, and a nightcap. It's also great if you drink a lot of premium coffees, fresh juices, and bottled water.
* **NO, if:** You only have a couple of drinks per day, you plan to spend most of your time off the ship in port, or you don't drink alcohol at all. In that case, paying per drink is much cheaper.

**⭐ Pro-Tip:** Look for cruise deals that **include a free drink package** as a booking perk. This is the absolute best way to get value, as it's a huge saving over paying for it out of pocket. Travel agents often have access to these deals.

1nigu12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1nigu12/tomar_the_tricky_verb_english_speakers_often/,Tomar: The Tricky Verb English Speakers Often Misuse,"Tomar is a verb you’ll hear all the time in Spanish, and it’s often used just like the English verb “to take.” But there are also plenty of situations where this logic doesn’t work, sometimes Spanish uses a completely different verb instead of ""tomar"", and other times it uses ""tomar"" in places where English wouldn’t use “to take” at all.

So, in this post, I’ll break down the main ways to use tomar in Spanish and highlight some of the most common mistakes learners make.

Let’s start with situations where the use of **“to take”** and **“tomar”** is **different**.

1 . “Take” meaning to carry/bring somewhere

* English: Take this box to your room.
* Spanish: Lleva esta caja a tu cuarto. → Llevar is used for transporting something to another place.

2. “Take” meaning to remove something from somewhere

* English: Take the book off the table.
* Spanish: Quita el libro de la mesa.→ Quitar or sacar are used for removing something from somewhere.

3. “Take” meaning to accept / receive

* English: I can’t take this gift.
* Spanish: No puedo aceptar este regalo.  (aceptar, not tomar) → Aceptar is used for accepting or receiving something.

4. “Take” meaning to endure / tolerate

* English: I can’t take this noise anymore.
* Spanish: No aguanto más este ruido.  (aguantar or soportar, not tomar) → Aguantar, soportar or tolerar are used for enduring or tolerating.

5. “Take” meaning to seize an opportunity

* English: Take this chance while you can.
* Spanish: Aprovecha esta oportunidad.  (aprovechar, not tomar) → Aprovechar is used when seizing an opportunity.

Try to remember these specific situations and avoid translating literally from English, so you don’t end up using tomar by mistake. 

Now let’s move on to the cases where **tomar** is actually **the right choice**:

1 . Consume food or drink

Use tomar when having something to eat or drink, especially in informal conversation.

* Vamos a tomar un café. → Let’s have a coffee.
* Siempre tomo té por la mañana. → I always have tea in the morning.

2 . Take medicine

Tomar is the standard verb for consuming medicine or remedies.

* Debes tomar estas pastillas después de comer. → “You must take these pills after eating.”

3 . Transportation (regional)

In much of Latin America, use tomar for “catching” or “taking” public transport. In Spain, coger is more common.

* En Lima siempre tomo el bus 15. → In Lima, I always take bus 15.

4 . Time expressions (duration)

Use tomar in certain fixed time expressions, mostly in Latin America, although tardar or llevar are often preferred in neutral Spanish.

* Me tomó dos horas llegar. → “It took me two hours to get there.”

5. Assumption of control, decision, or action

Spanish uses tomar in many expressions about assuming responsibility, control, or making choices.

* Tomar el control → “to take control” 
* Tomar una decisión → “to make a decision”
*  Tomar medidas → “to take measures”

6. Sunbathing and leisure

Use tomar for sunbathing or having a relaxing drink/snack.

* Me gusta tomar el sol en la playa. → “I like to sunbathe at the beach.” 
* Salimos a tomar algo. → “We went out for a drink/snack.”

7. Learning and recording information

Tomar works in set phrases about taking notes or recording data.

* Siempre tomo apuntes en clase. → “I always take notes in class.” 
* La enfermera tomó mi temperatura. → “The nurse took my temperature.”

8. Idioms and fixed expressions with ""tomar""

Some of the most common:

* Tomar el pelo (a alguien) → to tease / trick someone
* Tomar en serio → to take seriously
* Tomar en cuenta → to take into account
* Tomar partido → to take sides

1nigqqw,https://i.redd.it/3u2e8da8yipf1.jpeg,Black Tea. Do You Leave the Tea Bags In the Pot? Add Milk?,"I’ve recently switched to tea from coffee because coffee was doing a number on my stomach. 

My dad is a Brit who moved to the US, and my mom is a Canadian who drinks tea daily too. Been doing it for 60 years and I drank plenty of their tea cups.

Here’s the thing. Both of them always made tea the same way: three black tea bags (often Yorkshire Gold or the Canadian Morse’s Tea) in a big pot. Add boiling water. Then after maybe 5-10 minutes, they’d pour milk on the cup, no sugar, then add tea. You’d warm that mug up repeatedly until the pot was gone. And they wouldn’t pull out the tea bags. It would steep in that pot all morning till it was empty. This was always the way, such that I thought it was the only right way to drink black tea.

Now, however, I’m putting together my own tea setup. I have a 40 oz Churchill tea pot. A Smeg kettle. The Yorkshire Gold tea. And I did a little reading and to my surprise, people say you’re supposed to use FOUR tea bags in a pot that size. And you’re supposed to pull them at 5 minutes. And most people don’t add milk? I tried it this way and I’ll admit it makes a nice smooth cup of tea, but it’s missing that dry feeling in my mouth I used to get drinking it as a kid. So I switched back to their way for the moment.

Any thoughts? Were my folks just making tea wrong? Are there different schools of thought? Was my dad’s way just the old school British way? What’s the harm in using one less tea bag, but leaving them in?  Adding milk?

Many thoughts. Advice on how to make best possible tea (in your opinion) is appreciated. I miss coffee, but my stomach doesn’t!",5,1758027459.0,tea,7,0.86,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’m cleaning everything now that the humidity is lowered at around 60% downstairs and 65% upstairs. 

Should I call a mold remediation company to inspect my house? Are there companies that deep clean to treat mold? Should I throw out my coffee table and tv stand?
I’m not sure what to really do here as I’ve never had to deal with mold before. Any assistance would really help :/",2,1758027045.0,homeowners,1,1.0,False

I have horrible insomnia. I CANNOT sleep, like at all. Since Wednesday I’ve probably slept a total of 10 hours. In almost a week. 

My mind is racing nonstop and I feel extremely anxious and panicky. Almost like I’m in constant fight or flight mode and with butterflies in my stomach.

Even when I do sometimes get tired and start yawning, I’ll lay in bed and maybe I’ll shut off for 5 minutes and then I’ll wake up with energy again.

1nigjpc,https://i.redd.it/g8dne2jjwipf1.jpeg,My Dog was a Junk Food Junkie,"Good morning! My dog Sugar, the Collie/Husky/White Shepherd/German Shepherd mix mentioned in previous posts, was a junk food junkie. In spite of this, her weight seldom varied from 72 pounds—which, considering her lineage of large-breed dogs, wasn’t half bad. This may have been due to the fact that I am a lifelong hiker and walker, and she accompanied me on every trek. While I walked in a relatively straight line, she trotted to and fro, up and down the trail, so her wandering path probably meant she doubled or even tripled the number of miles I covered.

Sugar was given as much dog food as she wanted, both wet and dry, and she also shared every meal I ever ate during her lifetime. I always saved at least the last few bites for her. Nonetheless, when it came to goodies, all bets were off. An unguarded bag of bakery goods gifted to me by a friend was snatched up and consumed the moment my back was turned. Any time she managed to escape the house, she didn’t chase cars or — channeling her inner wolf— run off into the woods. Instead, she scampered down the road to the nearest eatery, where she begged for food at the back door or from patrons leaving with doggy bags in hand. She knew exactly what was in those bags.

I did my best to curb these tendencies— but then came the time I was working at a boatyard where we all took turns buying donuts for our coffee breaks. The shop was just around the corner and was owned and run by my former neighbor, a very cheery fellow I always enjoyed chatting with.

One day, when it was my turn to pick up the donuts, I was catching up with my old neighbor as he placed an assortment into a box. Casually, he remarked, “You know, the cutest dog shows up at my back door and begs for donuts every day!”

“Oh?” I said. “What does this dog look like?” I had my suspicions. His back door was just across a field from the boatyard where I worked, and my dog always came to work with me. She usually just stayed under or near the boat I was working on, but I was beginning to think that, if she felt a bit peckish, she might have decided to make the trip across the field. 

Sure enough, his description left no doubt: the donut beggar was my Sugar, who clearly took her name as a lifelong dietary guideline.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞

1nigigm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/1nigigm/rmpp_and_rmpp_move_owner_use_cases/,RMPP and RMPP Move owner - Use Cases,"RMPP and RMPP Move Owner – use cases

Long post incoming. Here is the TL:DR at the start.

* ***Use both RMPP and RMPP Move as complimenting devices***
* ***Im a sports coach, use the Move on game days***
* ***Predominantly use the Move during the day and take long form notes on the RMPP in the evening at my desk.***
* ***Combine the Plaud Note to revise/re-read meeting summaries on the RMPP.***

 Long version:

Thought I would share my experiences with the RMPP Move after a little over a week of using it as well as my specific use case that may help give ideas for others or provide some guidance for those thinking of getting it.

Background context: My profession – I am a sports coach and coach educator. I use remarkable products to take notes during matches as well use use it on coach education courses I deliver when taking notes during the course as well as observing coaches in their assessments. For my personal life I use it to read PDFs, take quick notes on phone calls as well us using quite religiously the Bujo bullet journal template to document my days both personally and professionally (keeping a coaching diary is a big part of my work) .

 I had the RM2 with type folio for 2 years before finally upgrading to the RMPP in May this year.

After owning the RM2 for 1 year , the RMPP came out and at the time I thought I was happy with my RM2 and didn’t feel the need to upgrade. However after watching a few longer term reviews of the RMPP I felt that it may be worth the upgrade. Heres why: I wasn’t using the RM2 for what it was originally intended for – taking notes. I was predominantly using the keyboard function on it, moreover – I was using the desktop app to type more than the actual device itself. I nearly sold the device purely for the fact that I thought I wasn’t using the physical device enough. In December when I archived the year from the RM2, I realised that I actually DID use it a lot more than I thought as there was a lot of random thought docs, brainstorming, mind maps etc (as well as notes from my language studies as I am learning another language) . So I immediately binned the idea of selling it and decide to make a conscious effort to actually write with it rather than use the keyboard (or the desktop app) .

In April after a cycle of matches for the team I coach, I was lamenting the fact that the device felt a bit slow when I was jumping between pages and what not and was missing parts of the game because I was fiddling around with the RM2. I was also using the color palettes on the RM2 and later exporting docs on the app so I could see them in color on my computer. It was then I seriously started looking at the RMPP mainly for the speed upgrade but the color as well. I pulled the trigger and bought one –this time without the type folio soI would *intentionally* write with the device instead of type on it -  and boy was I happy I did.

 I immediately noticed the upgrade in speed and (I know this is personal preference) I loved the writing experience. But here was my first problem. The device was so big – it was quite impractical to take notes while coaching – unless I had a desk I was sitting at. That was fine if we were playing in big stadiums with a coaches box and desk – but in the games where we were on just the pitch with no desk, I found it hard to hold the device up for long periods while taking notes, or I had to sit on the player dug out benches in order to do so. I said to myself “man if only there was an option for a smaller device that would fit in my jacket pocket and allow for easy quick access to take notes while on the “move” . Enter the RMPP Move release.

 I had no idea this was coming out as I don’t really follow the email updates that get sent through – they get sorted into another folder in my mail program, so if I want to check it , It must be done with intent. The first time I saw the Move was on a youtube video the day after release which lead me to watch the official release video. Here was the device I was looking for! I purchased immediately. I was a bit worried that the RMPP would now be useless to me. But I was wrong.  Whilst you can most definitely just purchase the Move and have that is your only device, having it combined with the RMPP is just a powerful combination.

Here are my use cases:

*  I have a brain dump doc and a note book for scribble notes for quick writing sessions.
* When I am not traveling. The RMPP stays at home and I take the Move with me for the day.
*  I still use the Bujo template to take quick bullet entries (at default size) during the day. Then later at home I do my long form entries in the evening to summarise those quick bullet points on the RMPP at my desk. I rarely use the zoom function on the Move. 
* The portability of the Move has been a god-send as I am able to freely take quick notes either during a match or on the fly during a training session – again allowing me to expand on the larger device like I normally would do but later at home that evening.
* If I do feel the need to write in more detail and I am able to set the device down say in a coffee shop, I can flip the Move horizontally and take longer form notes just like on the RMPP. However I haven’t felt the need to do this much.
*  I also recently purchased a Plaud Note to use for team meetings, coach educations etc – I was worried that the RMPP would be obsolete as the summaries that provides are pretty good, and I no longer have to be distracted taking notes DURING a meeting/course. However, what I have been doing is bouncing out the summaries from the Plaud and putting them on the RMPP – to later read and annotate/highlight the PDFs to revisit those meetings. I am getting far more retention from these using the Plaud summaries instead of trying to take notes DURING. Has made my life instantly easier.

Conclusion: Yes the RMPP and RMPP Move combo (and Plaud)  is not cheap but it has made my life, streamlined process and productivity but most importantly retention infinitely easier just in those small use cases. These are the main use cases I have but there are other smaller ones which I haven’t mentioned. Bottom line is, I get A LOT of use out my Remarkable ecosystem.

Only small gripe I had initially was I found the thickness of the pen strokes were different on the RMPP and the Move but that lasted 2 days before I think an update on either the pen or device might have fixed. Haven't had that issue since.

1nige6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1nige6m/explore_reikot_upgraded_cord_organizer_review_is/,Explore REIKOT Upgraded Cord Organizer Review Is This Kitchen Essential Worth It?,"Testing products and writing reviews help me uncover their nuances, both delightful and not-so-great, so here’s my personal experience with the REIKOT 1 upgraded cord organizer and what you might want to know before adding it to your collection.

**Design and Build Quality**

The moment I unboxed this silicone cord organizer, the first thing that caught my attention was its compact and flexible design. Measuring only 3.15 x 0.78 x 0.04 inches, it’s small but impressively sturdy. The product is made of high-quality food-grade TPR silicone, making it surprisingly durable, lightweight, and resistant to deformation. Its smooth, anti-static surface ensures it doesn’t collect dust, which was a relief considering the state of my kitchen most of the time. Plus, the material is BPA-free, which really matters for peace of mind when it’s going near food appliances. I loved that it’s available as a set of five—plenty to tame the mess from all my appliances in one go.

**Ease of Use and Setup**

Installing the cord organizer wasn’t brain surgery, but it did demand a touch of patience. The 3M adhesive backing is incredibly strong, but I followed the instructions to the letter: wiped down my appliances to eliminate grease or dust, stuck the organizer onto the cleaned surface, and then waited six solid hours before wrapping anything around it. Admittedly, waiting that long felt oddly like an eternity, but let me tell you, it was worth it. Once on, the organizers stuck like glue (pun intended) to surfaces ranging from wood and ceramic to stainless steel and even textured plastic. That versatility became a massive plus since not all of my appliances have smooth finishes.

**Highlights**

- Compatible with multiple appliances, from coffee makers to air fryers and toasters.  
- Super strong 3M adhesive ensures it stays put without peeling.  
- Made with food-grade BPA-free silicone, ensuring long-term durability.  

[Check REIKOT 1 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c7h5kp3q/)

**Practical Performance**

This is where the rubber met the road, or rather, the silicone met the cable chaos. My blender, air fryer, and coffee machine cords constantly tangled up like spaghetti at the back of my counters. The cable wrapper was a simple but effective solution. Its width of about 10mm allowed it to handle bulkier cords, which meant even my hefty pressure cooker cord wrapped securely. I didn’t expect such a small product to declutter my countertops so drastically. It saved not just visual space but also cleaned up my post-cooking frustration.

One unexpected benefit was its versatility. Beyond my kitchen, I slapped one onto my desk lamp, and another onto my laptop charging brick — both notorious for cable messes. It worked flawlessly in every instance, which makes me wonder why none of my coworkers had tipped me off about it earlier.

**Negatives**

As great as it is, the product isn’t perfect. Here are some of the areas where this device stumbled:

- Requires strict surface preparation before sticking it on, which can be time-consuming.  
- Adhesive takes a full six hours to properly “cure” for use.  
- Not reusable—if you remove it, that’s it; replacing it means using another from the set of five.  

**Comparison with Competing Products**

I’ve tried similar organizers before. Some were overly rigid plastic that didn’t curve against round appliance bodies, while others had flimsy adhesive that gave up in less than a week. In contrast, this silicone organizer from REIKOT is miles ahead in terms of durability, adhesive strength, and wide compatibility. That said, other brands like Command offer reusable options that might appeal to those wanting flexibility for future rearrangements.

For ultra-bulky cords (like industrial mixers), there are heavy-duty Velcro straps that outperform when it comes to sheer reinforcement, though they don’t have the elegance of this cord organizer’s design. If sleek aesthetics and universal appliance compatibility are your priorities, this product has a clear edge.

**Bang for the Buck**

Despite the adhesive’s limitations in reusability, its affordability and functionality tip the scales in its favor. This is especially true for a set of five—all for the price of a good latte. An upgraded version, should REIKOT ever launch one, could factor in movable or reusable adhesive, making the investment all the more attractive. Still, even in its current iteration, it offers solid value that justifies its cost.

That’s the real show. The air is crisp, the skies are clearer, and the whole city turns into this golden-red painting that actually lasts.

Fewer crowds, better weather with summer beautifully transitioning into winter, and honestly, the whole vibe is way more romantic. In case you are planning to be in Seoul this year, choose **late October to early November**, when the city glows in shades of red, yellow, and orange. This is gonna be our 3rd autumn in Korea and we don’t want to gatekeep the best spots anymore.

* **Gyeongbokgung Palace**: Needless to say, your Seoul trip will be incomplete without a visit to this place. Picture courtyards filled with fiery maples and golden ginkgo trees around the grand palace walls.  
* **Changdeokgung’s Secret Garden**:  A peaceful hideaway with fewer people and more calm. Don’t forget to see the reflection of the palace by the pond inside.  
* **Namsan Tower & trail:** Hike up to the tower through the trails to witness fall in full bloom, and while coming down, check out the view from the cable car.  
* **Haneul Park**: 20 mins away from Hongdae, this place is perfect to spot dreamy silver grass and pink muhly, especially magical at sunset.  
* **Eunpyeong Hanok Village**: Traditional hanok houses framed by Bukhansan and autumn leaves. Don’t forget to check out 1인1잔 cafe [https://naver.me/GFB1ltUH](https://naver.me/GFB1ltUH) for the best views.  
* **Seochon & Buam dong**: Cosy lanes, ivy-draped cafés, leaves everywhere and a laid-back neighborhood vibe without any tourist traps.  
* **Ewha Mural Village Road**: A quiet climb with red ivy and hidden murals that feel cinematic. Perfect for an afternoon stroll with a coffee.  
* **Yonsei-ro**: One of the best lanes to walk during autumn. So many K-dramas are shot here.  

That’s just a glimpse of the magic autumn brings to Seoul, but there’s so much more to explore!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

1nifygf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nifygf/i_m35_need_to_understand_what_happened_with_my/,I (M35) need to understand what happened with my colleague (F31),"Hello, everyone !

I need your input to understand a colleague's behavior; I need to take a step back.

We've been working together for three months. During those three months, there have been constant hot and cold phases. I finally noticed a pattern: she comes up to me, but as soon as I approach her, she backs away, and then when I walk away, she comes back.

Example: I sent her a slightly flirty message one evening. The next day, she said hello to me while looking at her feet. Then, when I went to a booth to make a phone call, I saw her looking at me for three or four seconds. And she ignored me all day. Then, the day after that, she sent me a message responding to my flirty message.

Example 2: After two days of distance, I headed to the coffee machine and had to walk past her desk. She saw me from a distance and hurried to get there before me. I lingered at the coffee machine and felt her behind me. I head for the elevator to go for a smoke and she gets in before me to invite herself along on my break.

Our relationship was punctuated by lots of phases like this: moments of warmth and moments of awkwardness! A friend finally told me that she was lost: too many emotions, too many problems to deal with, too much uncertainty. This is reflected in her behavior: 

\- She dares to come after me because she is in control: she knows what she wants, she knows her limits, she is comfortable with herself. 

\- She gets scared when I take the initiative because she is surprised, doesn't know how to manage her emotions, and doesn't feel in control of the situation.

My friend clearly advised me to stop making advances !

After my friend's advice, I decided to listen to her, but I cracked after a work party where she was very drunk. She couldn't stop being touchy-feely with me (resting her head on my shoulder, pressing herself against my back, when a colleague offered to let me sleep at his place, she asked me if I'd rather sleep at hers, half joking, etc.). The next day, she completely ignored me at work.

The following week, I sent her a text message to go for a drink “just the two of us” when she got back from vacation. She just replied “Thanks!” without responding to my invitation for a drink. From that moment on, I decided to give up hope.

When she came back from vacation, during a break we were taking together, she seemed stressed and, during our conversation, mentioned her boyfriend (I had thought until then that she was single) and continued talking without giving me a chance to respond. That evening, she sent me a video of a comedian who said that when you meet someone, it would be good to have access to their horoscope to avoid getting attached to them. She told me that the comedian reminded her of me.

Three weeks later, she suggested we go for a drink “as discussed.” I accepted, and the evening went well and felt like a date (she said she couldn't wait to meet my parents, our legs touched all evening, etc.).

In short, as you can see, I think these hot and cold spells have made me addicted... So to cut a long story short, I tried to clarify things by text:

Me: I've been thinking about our drink. I think I'm acting like everything is normal in our relationship... but sometimes I feel like that's not quite the case.

Her: Why do you say that? I think it's great to have allies and friends at work! I hope it's not the male/female relationship that bothers you?

Me: Aha, no, it doesn't bother me at all. On the contrary! I think I'm just having a little trouble pretending that I don't feel anything special for you. It's not very clear to me either, but I just needed to get it out there!

No reply to this message, and she still initiates contact afterwards and suggests coffee/cigarette breaks together.

Since I'm probably a bit of a fool, I suggested another drink, telling her we needed to talk “freely.” She takes three days to reply and cheerfully accepts, suggesting several dates.

During drinks, there was a kind of distance for the first time compared to our other moments together. She mentions her boyfriend twice. And as we leave the bar, I tell her we need to talk about something. Her face freezes with stress. We walk for a while, laugh a little, and I finally tell her that there's something between us, something ambiguous, so I'd like to talk about it. She tells me that, as in her message, we are “friends/allies at work.” I see her thinking for a long time (she tells me that it stresses her out because I'm not saying anything) and she says, “I understand the ambiguity, it happens to me with friends.” I say jokingly that I've been imagining things, she doesn't respond. And then we continue to talk and laugh together. I can see that she's trying to see if I'm okay. And I conclude by saying that it was healthier for us to be on the same wavelength and that I didn't want us to hurt each other.

In short, in my opinion, that was the real turning point that ended this story.

Since then, she has continued to contact me, but with much more distance 

I'm writing this because I realize that these ups and downs have made me addicted... And I'm still having trouble fully understanding what happened. I feel like I've been imagining things, and I'm strangely suffering from the situation.

If any attentive big sister has taken the time to read all this, I'm open to discussion.

  
Thanks in advance !

This product combines commercial-grade performance with streamlined usability, making it ideal for home use. Having tested this cartridge over the past few months, I’ve found it incredibly reliable for delivering cleaner, better-tasting water. Whether preparing food, filling up a tumbler for my workout, or even for my morning coffee, it’s become an essential part of daily life. Yet, like any product out there, it has its upsides and a few things you should know before jumping on board.

**Exceptional Filtration Performance**  
Right from the first use, the quality of the water was noticeably different. The cartridge’s ability to filter out particles as small as 0.5 microns is impressive. It effectively removes chlorine taste and odor, VOCs, lead, and other impurities. The NSF certifications ensure that it meets high standards of water purification, which offers great peace of mind. I even tested the water with a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter, and the difference compared to unfiltered tap water was staggering. This is especially vital in homes where water quality might be questionable, like mine.

**Ease of Installation and Use**  
This is where the Everpure H-300 shines. Installing the cartridge under my sink was a breeze, thanks to the quick-change feature. It also has a built-in shut-off valve, which meant I didn’t have to deal with shutting off the water supply separately when replacing the cartridge. The cartridge weighs only 2.5 pounds and fits snugly into its housing without taking up much kitchen space. What’s more, it’s designed to filter up to 300 gallons of water, which calculates roughly to about six months for my family’s usage—far better than other options I’ve tried in the past.

**Durability and Build Quality**  
The aluminum exterior of this cartridge isn’t just for show. I once accidentally knocked the housing with a kitchen utensil while rearranging some items, and it handled the bump without so much as a scratch. Its sturdy design ensures the filter won’t burst or split, which is a fear I’ve had with some of the plastic options on the market. Plus, since it’s made in the USA, there's an added layer of trust in its quality.

**Upsides**  
- Great at removing chlorine, lead, microplastics, and VOCs.  
- Strong aluminum casing ensures durability.  
- Quick and hassle-free cartridge replacements.  
- Filters the equivalent of 2,250 water bottles, saving money in the long run.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Cannot filter hot water; it’s strictly for cold water use.  
- The initial setup instructions could’ve been clearer for more novice users.  
- Expensive for some households compared to basic pitcher filters.  

**Alternative Products**  
While the Everpure H-300 excels in providing high-quality filtration, a few competitors are worth mentioning. The Brita Tap Faucet filter is a more affordable choice, though it lacks NSF-certified filtering for VOCs and lead removal. Reverse osmosis systems like the APEC ROES-50 offer superior filtration but come at higher installation and maintenance costs, not to mention they require additional space. For someone who doesn’t want the complexity of RO systems yet needs thorough filtration, I’d still lean toward this Everpure cartridge.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Price-wise, the cartridge does land on the premium side. However, factoring in its 300-gallon capacity and the contaminants it filters out, it’s an investment that more than earns its keep. Using fewer bottled waters alone offset some costs in my case, not to mention the benefits of cooking with cleaner water. If quality is a priority, this cartridge is absolutely worth it.

I’ve realized trying to break the ice with generic stuff can be such a flop, like, how many times can we talk about the weather, right? I’m thinking a better way to show interest moght be slipping a compliment about how they make my coffee just right or noitcing a pin they wear. 

It’s those subtle personal touches that can sometimes say more than fumbling thrkugh generic topics. Anyone else have tips for maknig smapl talk less... well, awkward? Or should I just stick to complimenting coffee skills? 😂",8,1758024857.0,FlirtFinesse,0,1.0,False
