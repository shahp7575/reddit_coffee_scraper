Recently, I had to step away from my job and I have been toying with the idea of trying to open a mobile coffee, bar, and doing pop-up events or even starting small in my neighborhood. We‚Äôre located in Virginia Beach and I have no idea where to start. I wanna make sure that I‚Äôm getting the correct permits and quality equipment. I also wanna make my own syrups in house. Does anyone have any advice on how to start? What department I should reach out to you or any resources that could guide me in the right direction? Also, any advice on any of your process processes or insights would be greatly appreciated. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been super passionate about, but I just have no idea how to start. I‚Äôm just a mom with a dream but something is telling me to take the leap. ",1,1753740620.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health.

1mbtysi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastEpoch/comments/1mbtysi/the_krafton_acquisition_might_not_be_the_end_times/,The Krafton Acquisition Might Not Be The End Times,"*/puts on flame-retardant suit*

I've seen the posts. ""RIP Last Epoch,"" ""Here come the battle passes,"" ""Another indie studio eaten alive."" As an early backer who's watched this game grow from janky into something great, I'm not doing cartwheels.

But what if there was good news here?

# The, ""Oh Shit, They Spent HOW Much?!"" Perspective

Krafton just dropped¬†**$96 MILLION**¬†on EHG. That's not ""let's milk this cow for two years"" money. That's ""we're building a franchise"" money. You don't spend nearly $100M to slap some battle passes on a game and call it a day.

Think about it: if they wanted quick cash, they could've bought three mobile game studios for that price and churned out match-3 garbage with anime waifus.

# Let's Talk About Gin For a Moment

*(Bear with me, this isn't as random as it sounds)*

Recently, a company called Ecology+Co (they make fancy non-alcoholic gin) got acquired. Everyone everywhere was like: ""RIP quality, hello price gouging!""

What actually happened? The big company used their distribution network and manufacturing scale to...¬†*reduce*¬†prices while maintaining quality. There's a philosophy angle here for sure, but sometimes leveraging global reach/scale (""resources"") is sometimes good for consumers.

# What Could Actually Go RIGHT

*Console Ports That Don't Suck*

* EHG has been ""looking into"" console ports for years
* Krafton has the resources to make this happen properly
* More platforms = more players = more revenue WITHOUT needing to squeeze existing players

*Infrastructure That Works*

* Remember launch day?¬†*shudders*
* Krafton runs PUBG's servers for millions of concurrent players
* Your disconnects during Monolith runs could become a thing of the past

*Global Reach Without the Jank*

* Proper translations (goodbye, machine-translated skill descriptions)
* Regional pricing that doesn't require selling a kidney
* Customer support that exists in more than one timezone

*Market Intelligence*

* Krafton has data on what monetization models make players ragequit
* They've seen Diablo 4's player count crater in real-time
* Sometimes knowing what NOT to do is more valuable than knowing what to do

# The Timeline of Cautious Optimism

*2025-2026: The Foundation Era*

* Console ports (PS5/Xbox first, Switch when they figure out how to make it not melt)
* Server infrastructure that doesn't hate you personally
* Localisation for humans, not Google Translate

*2026-2027: The ""Holy Shit, Content"" Era*

* Expansions that aren't limited by ""we have 12 developers and a coffee machine""
* Seasonal content (hopefully cosmetics, not ""pay $20 or your character gets deleted"")
* Cross-platform play so you can finally play with your console peasant friends

*2027-2029: The ""Are They Building a Universe?"" Era*

* Last Epoch 2 announcement (built with actual resources this time)
* MMO experiments (Krafton knows how to handle massive multiplayer)
* Genre spin-offs (imagine Last Epoch but as a story-driven RPG)

*2029+: The ""Franchise Mode Activated"" Era*

* Multiple games in the Last Epoch universe
* The original maintained as the ""classic"" entry point
* Your grandchildren will be arguing about Last Epoch 7 vs Last Epoch Classic

# Reality Check Time

I'm not saying this is guaranteed to go well. Corporate acquisitions are sketchy af, and Krafton could absolutely screw this up. But the dollar amount suggests they're thinking long-term franchise, not short-term cash grab.

The question isn't ""will Krafton change Last Epoch?"" (they will). The question is ""will those changes make the game better or worse?"" There's a chance they make it better.

*Source: I'm a recovering senior marketing manager who's seen enough corporate acquisitions to know the difference between ""strategic investment"" and ""asset stripping.""*

**TL;DR: $96M is ""build an empire"" money, not ""raid the village"" money. Cautious optimism might be warranted.**

*Edit: Yes, I know this is copium. But it's high-quality, artisanal copium.*",0,1753740492.0,LastEpoch,0,0.25,False

1mbtugh,https://www.reddit.com/r/navyseals/comments/1mbtugh/something_to_consider/,Something to consider,"What you‚Äôre getting yourself into: 10-15 min read. Weird spooky stuff that happened during and after the events of ‚ÄúStop Trying‚Äù. If I tarnish any ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù I have on the sub, who cares. ST made way beyond the impact I wanted and no written work actually matters that isn‚Äôt also risky. I‚Äôm 1 week cooled off from the end of this experience and I still feel like it‚Äôs relevant to this sub.

Event 1: July 2017. 
I give the program a shot and can‚Äôt cut it. 2nd phase (wow cool!), as if that matters when you start from Square 1 as another long-faced paintbrush boi on a big ship. Determined to be a sailor and sell my soul for a while so I can get another chance.

Event 2: October 2019. 
Got pins, ate rust, wore a Dixie cup, overall played the game. It becomes clear they‚Äôre not gonna let me try again. SO1 looking at my re-application package says to me ‚ÄúYep you should definitely be in buds‚Äù. Year groups, manning quotas, the inner workings of a giant unfeeling machine that ultimately doesn‚Äôt care about me OR despise me and has no interest my childhood pipe-dream of becoming a TG. I tap out ‚ÄúSTOP TRYING‚Äù in the base parking lot and the feedback sort of makes me feel like it wasn‚Äôt all for nothing. I decide to finish out my 4-year contract and try the outside world for a while.

Event 3: January 2021. 
Time‚Äôs up. Living in a funny-looking Ford transit van in PB whenever I don‚Äôt absolutely HAVE to be on the ship. Everyone in my chain of command is just as done with me as I am with them. Still no real plan except that I‚Äôm just FED UP with the navy and need to leave. Lockdowns in full swing. I drive from San Diego to Sacramento and shamefully move back into my parents‚Äô house for a few weeks. Me and a 20-year 1st class get recalled from separation leave for some admin processing issue that‚Äôs just beyond me to this day. In hindsight, this would set the stage for my first of two actual experiences with the entity. At the time, I chalk it up as a series of panic attacks that happen 3-4 nights in a row and then sporadically throughout the day. Vivid imagery, bodily constrictions, sudden paranoia. Scariest experiences of my life ever. During the attacks, I almost feel like jumping out a window and once almost crash on the highway. No pills, no drugs, and I don‚Äôt really drink a whole lot. I had already gotten into meditation at that point and decide to take it seriously so that this stops happening. I work hard and it eventually does.

Event 4: March 2025. 
Five years on the outside. Now I‚Äôm 29
and I still don‚Äôt know what I wanna be when I grow up. Experiences include another botched attempt at college, some get-rich-quick experiments, showbusiness exploration, and a buffet of odd jobs trying everything and getting nowhere. Right before I‚Äôm finally about to commit to a 5-10 year plan and actually make it somewhere in the world, I meet a ‚Äúmedicine woman‚Äù in a coffee shop and decide to try and get a birds-eye view of life with this ayauaska potion the internet‚Äôs talking about.

Event 5: July 2025. 
I‚Äôve saved up all the flights/fees for the trip working at a moving company and living in a 10x10 windowless room in some halfway house on the outskirts of Austin TX. I get on a plane and suddenly find myself sitting around a campfire in some part of Brazil I‚Äôve never heard of, in front of a nice shaman named Glauber handing me cup of the barf-y apple juice. Down the hatch.
-Trip stage 1: Shapes
I sit down and let the stuff start talking. Blurry fractals not much different from the rest of the ‚Äúfuzz‚Äù on the inside of my eyelids. The first one is an expanding oval that kind of looks like a birth canal
-Trip stage 2: the waiting room
I lay down. Dance party in a dark night club in the underbelly of the universe. I meet the face columns from that Tool album cover, it‚Äôs a real place somewhere outside the simulation. A ceiling tile opens up and two stone-men call me up for my turn
-Trip stage 3: Fire jester
I sit up and look at the fire. I start chirping all these flaming log-men making an idiot out of themselves. At some point I muse to myself ‚ÄúTHERE MUST BE OTHER COLORS‚Äù and the guy next to me shares a laugh. This is a good time, I‚Äôm in!
-Trip Stage 4: Uh-oh
Sudden indescribable agony attached to nothing. Visual of a pile of writhing colored worms. I wanna puke but can‚Äôt at first. Generally trying not to freak out
-Trip stage 4: purge
I violently barf up all the ayauaska. Bucket splatters 4 or 5 times
-Trip stage 5: Scalpel
Vivid imagery of 1st phase staff on the beach from 8 years prior. I see the entity occupying some portion of all of them. My body is convulsing on the ground. Shamans trying to help me out with calming energy bubbles. Screaming and crying really strange stuff ‚ÄúIT WAS A REAL WAR‚Äù ‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL WERE THOSE GUYS‚Äù ‚ÄúTHEY CREATED IT‚Äù. Sludge energy shooting out through my head and shoulders. This is very strange because despite the brutality I generally remember 1st phase as a positive experience and never once thought of those guys in blue shirts as ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù. Several times in my life before and after, I‚Äôve been more miserable than I was during those 4 weeks so I asked myself why THAT event of all things is what popped up. Stay tuned 
-Stage 5: cooldown. I feel like I‚Äôve lost 70 pounds. There‚Äôs some noticeable release where the ‚Äúbirth canal‚Äù would be on my body but pants are dry. Some volunteers drag me into bed. I have scary visuals until like 6AM. Last one I see is like a Polaroid stuck on the wall of 2 peaceful-looking greys and then I fall asleep.

Intermission. Go step outside for a sec and then come back.

Analysis. 
I spent all the next day documenting the trip and connecting the dots where I thought it was relevant. Here‚Äôs what I think is going on:
-There is something OUT THERE (the entity) that feeds off of spiritual drainage. The kind a lot of you guys feel who work on ships doing something that‚Äôs the total opposite of how you wanted life to turn out. That‚Äôs real and leaves guys in a vulnerable state to be internally eaten alive by whatever these things are.
-The entity found an ample source of guys in this position through this ‚Äúevent‚Äù (1st phase) that happens 5-6 times a year in San Diego. It strategically decided to use the instructors as a conduit to flow into young men who are imminently about to be lost and miserable in the fleet.
-It got into me while I was there. Can‚Äôt pinpoint a specific incident (maybe the hell week port-o-John XD) or if it just worked its way in over the 4 weeks
-It laid dormant for about 3 years until it found a point where I was really lost (Event 3) and basically tried to kill me. The meditation eventually held it down for the most part
-I went into the trip and the ‚Äúgood‚Äù spirits decided to surgically cut out the entity. They lured me in at first with with the fun fire visuals and jester mood since they know I wouldn‚Äôt just volunteer for the bad part. It removed a blockage by barfing then took me back to the time I got infected to shake the thing out. The convulsions were the entity getting expelled
-the greys or spirits showed themselves to me at the very end as a parting gesture

Well that‚Äôs what I think and that‚Äôs what happened. Buds duds tend to be their own kind of kooky and this might explain why. Up to you guys from here. Hmu if you‚Äôve seen something similar.

Everyone's always complaining about them being bland or cheap, but honestly? I love them. First off it's free food that you don't have to cook, order, or clean up after. You just roll out of bed, stumble downstairs in your pajamas if you want, and there's a whole spread waiting for you. No decision fatigue about where to eat or what to get. It's not fancy cuisine, but those little muffins and pastries hit different when you're traveling. There's something about eating a slightly stale blueberry muffin while planning your day in a new city that just works. And don't even get me started on the waffle stations - making your own waffle at 7am feels like a small victory.  
Plus there's something nostalgic about the whole experience. The industrial orange juice dispensers, the coffee that's been sitting there for who knows how long, the random assortment of cereals in those clear dispensers. It reminds me of being a kid on family road trips when getting to eat at the hotel breakfast felt like such a treat. Maybe I'm just easily pleased, but I genuinely look forward to it every trip. It's become part of the travel experience for me. Give me that predictable continental breakfast over trying to find a decent restaurant at 6am any day.

# Weather & Monday Rundown (Monday, July 28th)

Burlington's kicking off the week with some seriously soupy conditions. That thick morning fog blanketing the city will burn off by late morning, giving way to hazy sunshine as Canadian wildfire smoke drifts back into town. We're looking at a hot and sticky Monday with temperatures climbing near 90 and humidity levels that'll have you feeling every degree of it. Tuesday brings more of the same swampy weather before Wednesday's cold front delivers some scattered afternoon storms, a few of which could pack a punch. But here's the payoff: Thursday and Friday promise a taste of early fall with sunshine, temps in the 70s, and humidity taking a well-deserved break. The weekend's shaping up nicely too, with dry conditions and temperatures creeping back into the 80s.

Tonight's the night for Burlington's running community to hit the pavement together. Skirack hosts their weekly Monday Group Run at 6 PM, perfect for anyone looking to log 3 to 5 miles at whatever pace suits them. Just show up at their Run Center inside the store and park out back while you pound the pavement. Meanwhile, The Pinball Co-op's got their Classics Pace Matchplay spinning up tonight, where maintaining momentum is everything. Last flipper standing takes the crown, and while the tournament's free, it's $20 at the door unless you're already a member. Tuesday's calendar is absolutely stacked with ways to beat the heat and connect with your neighbors. The EZ Breezy Urban Adventure rolls out at 6 PM for a no-drop bike ride that winds 7 miles through Burlington's streets before ending at Oakledge Park. Here's where it gets interesting: they're hiding a canvas musette bag designed by Tender Warrior Co somewhere in the park, and riders dressed in their best Indiana Jones or Jumanji gear get bonus style points for this humid jungle adventure. Later that evening at 7 PM, The Monkey House transforms into an open mic venue courtesy of Foam Brewers, with Mike Paternoster hosting and slots available until 9 PM. Just remember to bring your own instruments since there's no backline provided.

Wednesday brings Burlington's own take on the Italian passeggiata starting at 5 PM, when locals stroll downtown to shop, sip, and socialize in a tradition that's more social ritual than organized event. Check the deals at participating businesses ([Passeggiata Deals](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata)) and embrace this simple way to support local shops while catching up with neighbors. RunVermont and Burlington Parks team up for their Youth Fun Run at 5:30 PM, offering free half-mile and one-mile races for kids before the Leddy Beach Bites celebration takes over with food trucks, drinks, and live music against that gorgeous lake sunset. For anyone seeking employment opportunities, the Vermont Lake Monsters host ""Take Me Out To The Job Fair"" from 5 to 7 PM at Centennial Field, where visiting the VDOL table scores you a free ticket to the game. Music lovers should head to Colchester at 7:30 PM, where the Craftsbury Chamber Players present their third weekly concert featuring folk-inspired works at Elley-Long Music Center, with tickets at $25 for adults and free admission for kids 12 and under.

Thursday brings cooler weather and plenty of reasons to celebrate. The Btown Brief Friends Mixer returns for round three at The Pinery in the South End, starting at 6:45 PM. After two successful gatherings, this free social night continues to make meeting new people refreshingly easy, with icebreaker games like Group Scattegories and Rock, Paper, Scissors tournaments helping conversations flow naturally. Whether you're a returning friend or first-timer, everyone shows up for the same reason: genuine connection without the usual social guesswork. Meanwhile, the Old East End Neighborhood Coalition hosts their second monthly Potluck in the Park at Schmanska Park on Grove Street, with dinner served from 6 to 8 PM. After drawing over 50 neighbors to their first dinner, they're ready for round two with dishes to share, though you're welcome to just show up and eat. South Burlington gets in on the action with SB Nite Out #6 at Veterans Memorial Park starting at 5:30 PM, featuring a back-to-school supply drive and the first 250 kids scoring free lunch bags. Church Street Marketplace wraps up Thursday with The Tenderbellies bringing their Vermont string band magic to Party on the Bricks at 5:30 PM, blending everything from bluegrass to jazz in the heart of downtown.

Briefly looking ahead to this weekend, Festival of Fools is back as the ""Fools Block Party"" thanks to an extraordinary grassroots effort led by Caf√© HOT. and supported by over 30 local businesses plus the Pomerleau Family Foundation. Friday and Saturday will transform Church Street Marketplace and City Hall Park with the hilarious hounds of Mutts Gone Nuts, acrobatic siblings the Red Trouser Show, Burlington's own Murmurations Aerial, juggling genius Hilby the Skinny German Juggle Boy, and marvelous musical acts including Robber Robber and Cricket Blue. This community-powered celebration (which has drawn 50,000 people in the past) proves that even facing budget cuts and construction headaches, Burlington refuses to let go of the joy that makes summer in this city special.

Today‚Äôs heat (90‚ÄØ¬∞F / 71‚ÄØ¬∞F) sits notably above the typical summer average of \~81‚ÄØ¬∞F high and 62‚ÄØ¬∞F low, nudging toward more intense but not record levels. The next three days continue this warm trend, with highs in the mid‚Äë80s and lows in the low 60s; all above normal but far from Burlington‚Äôs 101‚ÄØ¬∞F record high.

# Burlington Table: Meet 5 Strangers at a Brewery

**Burlington Table is a new way to meet real people around a real table. Just good conversation with 5 strangers-turned-friends (6 total) over drinks at a local brewery next Monday, July 28th at \~6pm. Drinking is optional, not a requirement!**

**Today**¬†is the day of the brewery meetup and I had over 45+ people sign up! I had to spread the event over several breweries to avoid any confusion during the meet-up portion (and also not overwhelming one single brewery.) I was able to fit everyone that signed up, so be sure to check your email to make sure you know where you‚Äôre going and what time the meet up is. I staggered a couple of groups by 15 minutes, so try your best to show up on time! Side note: if you don‚Äôt see any email from me ([BtownBrief@gmail.com](mailto:BtownBrief@gmail.com)) then be sure to check your spam folder, or just email me directly to ask about your group. I found that out when one of you guys sent me an email that I eventually found it in my spam folder.

I‚Äôm going to be gathering post meet-up emails to gather your feedback, and on things that you like or didn‚Äôt like. Be on the look out for those. I‚Äôll try to post some of feedback in Thursday‚Äôs edition of the Btown Brief. If it goes well, I‚Äôd love to hold another event like this, so stay tuned!

Suggested $5‚Äì$10 Venmo u/BtownBrief to cover organizing. It takes a a surprising amount of effort to coordinate with everyone! Ready for some real connections? Grab a seat at the next table! More info about it by clicking this link:

[**Businesses Rally to Throw a Downsized Festival of Fools**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/arts-culture/businesses-rally-to-throw-a-downsized-festival-of-fools-43812497?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th)

""This event is widely beloved,"" per Seven Days.

Burlington City Arts' Festival of Fools will happen after all this weekend, though scaled down to a two-day block party after funding cuts initially forced its cancellation. The grassroots rescue effort began when Caf√© HOT. owners Travis and Allan Walker-Hodkin rallied fellow business owners to donate, raising enough to bring back crowd favorites like Mutts Gone Nuts, Hilby the Skinny German Juggle Boy, the Red Trouser Show, and the Circus Smirkus Road Show for August 1-2. The Pomerleau Family Foundation's generous support specifically enabled Friday evening events, while new additions include Burlington's own Murmurations Aerial, street entertainer Mason Ames, Vermont indie darlings Robber Robber, acclaimed folk duo Cricket Blue, and UK electronic music wizard Hidden Spheres. What makes this particularly remarkable is that downtown businesses stepped up despite their own struggles with construction closures and declining foot traffic. The typical three-day festival draws 50,000 people and represents many merchants' best weekend of the year, so losing it would have been another blow to an already challenging summer. While this year's ""Fools on a shoestring"" operates on a fraction of the usual $120,000 budget and features primarily local talent rather than international acts, the community's determination to preserve joy in difficult times speaks volumes about Burlington's resilience. As Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak noted, this exemplifies how community and city come together to create something beautiful and joyful. Organizers expect to have the detailed schedule live by Tuesday morning at¬†[https://vermontfestivaloffools.com/](https://vermontfestivaloffools.com/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th), and the door remains open for additional donations.

""Friday's game sold out in under 30 seconds,"" per VTDigger.

Vermont Green FC's magical season continued Friday night with a 3-1 overtime victory over Virginia's Lionsbridge FC in the USL Eastern Conference finals. The team now hosts Alabama's Dothan United in Sunday's national semifinals at 6:30 PM, with tickets likely to vanish just as quickly. Since its 2022 founding, the club has built something special here, combining environmental justice advocacy with top-tier soccer featuring UVM's national championship players. The atmosphere at Virtue Field has become an attraction itself, with the Green Mountain Bhoys supporters group driving raucous crowds that overflow onto the unticketed hill. This 16-match undefeated season represents athletic success, but it's also validation of the club's vision that professional sports can champion social causes while building genuine community connections.

[**Q&A: New UVM President Marlene Tromp on In-State Enrollment, Staff Layoffs and Future of DEI on Campus**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/27/qa-new-uvm-president-marlene-tromp-on-in-state-enrollment-staff-layoffs-and-the-future-of-dei-on-campus/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th)

""I want to protect people's academic freedom to make those choices, and that's the hill we have to stand on,"" per VTDigger.

New UVM President Marlene Tromp arrives from Boise State at a precarious moment, facing federal research funding cuts, enrollment pressures, and ongoing budget challenges. In her first major interview, Tromp committed to increasing Vermont student enrollment while acknowledging the demographic reality that for every in-state graduate, two out-of-state peers stay and work here. She addressed the university's hiring freeze and recent layoffs candidly, noting uncertainty around federal funding makes lifting the freeze premature. On the proposed legislation to cap UVM enrollment when Burlington's housing vacancy falls below 5%, Tromp emphasized partnership over confrontation, pointing to successful collaborations in Boise that increased housing options. Most notably, she defended academic freedom as non-negotiable despite federal pressure, signaling UVM could become a national leader in demonstrating how universities protect democratic values.

[**Sen. Peter Welch Celebrates Grand Opening of Renovated Pool at Burlington Boys and Girls Club**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/senator-peter-welch-celebrates-grand-opening-of-renovated-pool-at-burlington-boys-and-girls-club/65530729?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th)

""Whenever we ask Sen. Welch's office about something, and say, 'Here are the ways you can support us,' their answer is always 'yes,'"" per NBC5.

The Boys and Girls Club unveiled its newly renovated pool Monday, a $600,000 project four years in the making that now serves 100 kids daily with swimming lessons and recreation. The surprise dedication to longtime staff member Joyce McEntee added an emotional touch to the ribbon-cutting ceremony. What makes this renovation particularly significant is its timing, as the club provides three free meals daily and comprehensive summer programming for families who need reliable childcare. Senator Welch's consistent federal funding support demonstrates how effective advocacy can transform community spaces, ensuring parents can drop off their children knowing they'll be cared for by people who genuinely care about their wellbeing.

[**Restoration Project Underway to Preserve Burlington Library**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/28/restoration-project-underway-preserve-burlington-library/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th)

""I think that this is one of the most beautiful buildings in Burlington,"" per WCAX.

The Fletcher Free Library's $3 million restoration project has temporarily transformed the 1904 building into a construction zone, with boarded windows and fencing surrounding half the structure. Despite the visual disruption, the library remains fully operational inside while crews refurbish windows and repaint deteriorating brick and terracotta elements. Director Mary Danko frames this as essential preservation work for a building whose architectural grandeur represents an era of civic investment we rarely see today. For regular visitors like Emily Robbins and her son who visit multiple times weekly, the temporary inconvenience represents hope that Burlington continues investing in its cultural anchors rather than letting them decay.

[**Champlain Islands Holds Event to Encourage Canadian Visitors to Return**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/28/champlain-islands-holds-event-encourage-canadian-visitors-return/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th)

""We're going to miss the Blue Paddle but we're not coming back until things change,"" per WCAX.

Sunday's ""Paddles Without Borders"" event at Blue Paddle Bistro addressed a painful reality: Canadian border crossings into Vermont are down 24% since February's tariff threats. For the Champlain Islands, where Canadian visitors form the backbone of summer tourism, this represents an existential threat to local businesses. The free burger event, supported by donations from Fiddlehead and other local businesses, sent a clear message that political tensions shouldn't sever decades-old friendships and economic relationships. Blue Paddle's 20-year history serving Canadian friends makes this decline particularly personal, with hundreds of regular visitors explicitly stating they're boycotting until policies change. The grassroots diplomacy effort highlights how border communities bear the real costs of international political posturing.

""We really want to expose it to different people to see that art doesn't have to be in a museum,"" per WCAX.

Burlington artists are constructing ""LOOP,"" a massive interactive musical wheel headed for Burning Man before returning to tour Vermont. The piece functions as a giant hamster wheel that plays music as participants move it, embodying the collaborative spirit of both Burlington's art scene and the desert festival. What sets this project apart is its commitment to accessibility: after showcasing at Burning Man, LOOP will travel throughout Vermont, bringing participatory art to communities that rarely experience such installations. The hundreds of volunteer hours already invested reflect Burlington's unique creative ecosystem, where artists build ambitious projects not for galleries but for direct public engagement.

[**Vermont Corrections Commissioner Nick Deml to Step Down, Former Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad to Take Over**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/28/vermont-corrections-commissioner-nick-deml-to-step-down-and-former-burlington-police-chief-jon-murad-to-take-over/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-28th)

""After more than two decades in municipal public service, I'm excited to move to the larger stage of serving the great state of Vermont,"" per VTDigger.

Jon Murad's appointment as interim Corrections Commissioner represents a significant career pivot for Burlington's former police chief, who left the department after opposing the council's force reduction efforts. Murad inherits a system grappling with severe staffing shortages, mandatory 16-hour shifts, and questions about prison healthcare following deaths at Southern State Correctional Facility. Outgoing Commissioner Nick Deml leaves a legacy focused on addiction treatment and peer recovery programs, though his tenure faced scrutiny over medical care quality. The transition places Murad, who navigated Burlington's contentious policing debates during the 2020 protests, into another high-pressure role requiring Senate confirmation. His law enforcement background and experience managing controversial reforms may prove valuable in addressing Vermont's ongoing correctional challenges.

# Friends Mixer/Meet Up Event¬†Thursday¬†at the Pinery

**The Btown Brief Mixer is Back!**

After such a great time and turnout for our first two get-togethers, the Btown Brief Friends Mixer is back for round three this week. For anyone who couldn't make it the last couple of times, the goal is simple: it‚Äôs a low-pressure social night designed to make it easy to meet new people. The best part is that everyone who shows up is there for the same reason, which takes all the usual guesswork out of striking up a conversation.

Join us again at The Pinery in the South End this Thursday, starting around 6:45 PM. As before, it's completely free. I‚Äôll bring back some of the simple icebreakers and group games to get conversations flowing. Whether you're a returning friend or a first-timer, I hope you'll come hang out, play a game, and say hello. Last time our main hosted games were Group Scattegories and Rock, Paper, Scissor Tournament; come see what this week‚Äôs will be. We‚Äôll also have more passive, stationary ice breaker games so don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre pressured to participate if you just want to hang out and chat with people.

# This Week‚Äôs Restaurant Review: Trattoria Delia

For over three decades, Trattoria Delia has been a cornerstone of Burlington‚Äôs dining scene, offering a truly authentic Italian experience from its cozy nook on Saint Paul Street. The ambiance is immediately transportive, set within a historic building featuring the rustic interior of a relocated sugar house and a grand stone fireplace. This intimate and romantic setting makes it a perennial favorite for special occasions, promising an escape from the everyday bustle with a focus on traditional, regional Italian fare prepared with both local Vermont ingredients and curated Italian imports.

The menu is a testament to classic Italian culinary arts, emphasizing expertly handmade pastas and rich, flavorful entrees. Standouts like the hearty Rigatoni alla Bolognese and the decadent Filetto al Barbera have become signatures for good reason. The experience is further elevated by an extensive, award-winning wine list that features exclusively Italian selections, carefully chosen to complement the food. Combined with service that is frequently lauded as some of the most professional and attentive in the city, a meal at Trattoria Delia feels both polished and deeply comforting.

However, this classic fine-dining approach comes with a price tag to match, positioning it firmly in the special-occasion category for most. The menu‚Äôs strict adherence to tradition, while a strength, may not appeal to diners seeking more contemporary or experimental Italian cuisine. Due to its intimate size and well-deserved popularity, securing a reservation can be challenging at times, particularly on peak evenings. Despite these considerations, Trattoria Delia remains an essential Burlington destination for anyone craving a truly classic Italian meal executed with masterful precision.

I (20F) have been with Adam (30M) for a little over a year. I know the age gap seems a lot, but he‚Äôs been nothing but generous and kind to me. He has his own company, he‚Äôs successful, and honestly he changed my life. He let me move in, got me out of a really unstable situation, and even gave me a job with his team. I know I‚Äôm lucky.

Last week, he invited me to his team‚Äôs client dinner. It was a big deal fancy restaurant, important people, lots of wine and suits. I wore this black dress he helped me pick out a few weeks ago. I felt pretty. Like, really pretty. He told me I looked amazing when we left the house, held my hand in the car, everything felt good.

At the table, I was nervous but trying to be confident. People were laughing and chatting, and I was trying to fit in. At one point, someone asked how we met, and I made a light joke and said, ‚ÄúHe basically hired me and then realized I‚Äôm cute too.‚Äù Everyone laughed, it wasn‚Äôt dirty or anything it was just playful.

But he didn‚Äôt laugh. He kind of smiled tight then got really quiet. The rest of the night he barely looked at me. In the car, he just said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know when to keep your mouth shut sometimes.‚Äù That really hurt me so I apologized but also said it wasn‚Äôt that big deal but he really didn‚Äôt like that either and just drove. We had a huge argument the whole ride home I ended up up crying(I‚Äôm very emotional and sensitive so yeah)

Ever since, he‚Äôs been different.Very cold, polite but distant. At work, it‚Äôs strictly professional but at home, he‚Äôs quiet. He still pays for things, still buys me coffee, but the warmth is gone. I asked if he‚Äôs mad and he said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal. Just think before you speak next time.‚Äù

I feel like I embarrassed him but I didn‚Äôt mean to. I honestly thought I was being charming. I‚Äôve never been to events like that before. I‚Äôm still figuring this stuff out.

My friends say he overreacted and I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but I feel like I did and I need some outside perspective.",0,1753739713.0,Advice,4,0.5,False
1mbtmwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mbtmwh/my_experience_with_a_deadbeat_roommate/,My experience with a deadbeat roommate,"I (25F) live with 2 others (27M, 26M). We‚Äôre all family friends, but my family is closer to 27M‚Äôs family and 27M was closer friends with 26M prior to us moving in. We all went to the same high school and hung out when we could during college breaks.

I previously lived with 2 other men while in college, one being our other family friend. There were no issues then‚Äîex. we didn‚Äôt have a dishwasher and they both hand washed their dishes right away after each use! So I didn‚Äôt have a bad experience living with other men and went into this living arrangement with high hopes‚Ä¶ or so I thought.

26M is the problem roommate. We should have put the pieces together prior to living together. 26M‚Äôs family is loaded to the point where it‚Äôs almost ridiculous. Insane house, insane features, expensive cars, etc. his mom would also quite literally serve him food while he‚Äôd be gaming in the basement and even clean up after him. He‚Äôd just leave his dishes and trash when he was done and his mom would come collect it. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre dealing with here. For context, this man also holds a doctorate degree.

27M‚Äôs family is also loaded, but he was raised properly. He cooks, he wipes down all surfaces when he‚Äôs done, he vacuums on his own accord, etc. 

Here‚Äôs a list of what we‚Äôve had to deal with regarding 26M:
- He uses Zyn pouches and when he‚Äôs done using them, he puts them in his pocket. He then washes his pants with the used Zyns still in his pockets. The Zyns would scatter all over the floor and within the washing machine and he didn‚Äôt bother to clean it up. The first time I confronted him about it, he tried to blame it on 27M. It kept happening, so I confronted him again. He again tried to shift blame. Still kept happening. So I put big red sticky notes all over the washer‚Ä¶ IT STILL. KEPT. HAPPENING.

- he‚Äôs put his used smelly socks balled up on the counter. His feet and body fucking STINK too.

- He hasn‚Äôt touched a mop, vacuum, or spray bottle since we moved in Nov. 2024.

- He hasn‚Äôt stepped foot in a grocery store since we moved in as well. Instead, he helps himself my snacks and drinks without asking. Repeatedly, even after I confronted him multiple times. Mind you, he makes more than double my salary. More than mine and 27M combined, actually.

- He‚Äôs left the remains of his dinners on the coffee table overnight. Ate then just went upstairs to game. Yup, just like at home, he eats then literally leaves it all there‚Äîdishes, trash, leftover food, everything. My dog got into it and she got diarrhea. I was pissed and when I confronted him, he blamed my dog for even doing it in the first place. 

- He pisses all over the toilet seat in our guest bathroom and I‚Äôve sat in it. Straight up doesn‚Äôt even put the seat up. I‚Äôve confronted him 3 times about it and it still happens. He didn‚Äôt even say sorry, he straight up acted like it was not a big deal and I was overreacting and that I should have looked before I sat down. 

- doesn‚Äôt flush, perpetually. #2 and #1. He and 27M share their own bathroom but he will sometimes use the guest one. Happens in both bathrooms.

- since he hasn‚Äôt gone to any store whatsoever, he resorts to stealing 27M‚Äôs toiletries when he‚Äôs out. However, 27M just lets him have it and he buys himself more.

- 27M and I hosted a cookout that he knew of 2 weeks in advance. He sat on his ass and literally watched us run around and set up starting at 9 am the day of. Fine, whatever‚Äîbut he took full advantage of 27M‚Äôs grilling and our drinks we bought. He gluttonous ass loaded his plate up and stacked 2 burger patties on a bun.

- after the cookout, we all went to the bars but 27M and I left early because we were exhausted. He then talked shit on us to our friends for leaving the bar early  

- he finished all the leftover burgers from the cookout. I went to the store and got buns because I was craving a leftover burger. Before I could eat one, he helped himself to the buns I just got and again, HEATED UP AND AT THE LAST. TWO. BURGER PATTIES FOR HIMSELF. 

- he tried hitting on me a few months after we first moved in and I shut that shit down. He was very weird about it and I literally set up a camera in my room because I was afraid he was approaching panty sniffer territory 

- he disrespects my dog. She‚Äôs 14 years old and he insists she‚Äôs faking not being able to go up the steps. Multiple times he plops her in the middle of the steps and makes her go up them where she‚Äôs fallen down. Every time he tries to pick her up she also screams and yelps. Every. Time. And blames her when I yell at him?

- Has unloaded the dishwasher a total of 3 times. He leaves half of them on the counter because he doesn‚Äôt know where anything goes

- we all sat down and made a household email when we moved in to keep track of bills. He didn‚Äôt pay 27M rent or utilities (in his name) for the first 3 months and when 27M asked for it, he said ‚Äúyeah tell me how much.‚Äù I shut that down and said ‚Äúno, you figure it out from the email we all sat down and made. It‚Äôs all there, it‚Äôs been there. It‚Äôs your responsibility, not 27M to tell you‚Äù

- his room STINKS. Like the stench permeates the hallway and our bedrooms. He sits in there for 8 hours a day gaming and marinating in his post work stench. Hasn‚Äôt washed his sheets in months. He keeps a kitchen size garbage bag of leftover food and trash on his floor and doesn‚Äôt take it out for weeks at a time. We‚Äôve confronted him about the smell twice now. No change. He said ‚Äúfine, I‚Äôll light more candles‚Äù the second time.

- he said he was tired of me bitching him out for his negligence. I said I was tired too and 27M needs to do it because he needs to hear it from another man. He said he prefers me to tell him, not 27M? And in person too, not just text (I did both). When I do confront him, he feigns ignorance, shifts blame, makes excuses, or tells me my OCD makes me have unrealistic expectations (I don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt piss on the toilet seat and pick up a vacuum once in a while????)

- his only job is to take the trash on the curb weekly. He neglects to do JUST that even though it‚Äôs routine.

- microwaves shit to reheat for 4 minutes at a time and lets things explode inside and doesn‚Äôt clean it

- finished multiple cases of beer 27M and I got for ourselves without asking. Yet, he openly criticizes us for our ‚Äúdrinking problems‚Äù‚Äîgoing to the bar every Saturday with our other friends. Yet he tops off our cases alone in his room while playing video games and finished a whole bottle of whiskey in one sitting while we were all casually drinking beer outside one weekend

- leaves leftovers in the fridge for weeks until I take care of it. This is often as he orders DoorDash for dinner every single night

- complains and talks shit that all 27M and I only go out to bars as our activity. Yet he hasn‚Äôt suggested or proposed any alternatives

- then complains we don‚Äôt invite him out despite judging us and not suggesting other things he‚Äôd like to do

- loads the dishwasher completely wrong (the 2 times he‚Äôs ever done it) IYKYK

- talks endless shit on 27M to me. Says he wants to rip his vape out of his hands and literally ‚Äúslap some sense into him‚Äù because it‚Äôs unhealthy. he‚Äôs on a high horse bc of his doctorate. Yet he does Zyns. Most recent complaint that 27M has been missing their bathroom trash can with his trash‚Ä¶ WHILE RECOVERING FROM EYEBALL SURGERY. Completely irrelevant when he still pisses all over the toilet seat we ALL use even after MULTIPLE conversations

I can go on and on and on. But Jesus‚Äîsince living with him, I don‚Äôt give a shit about our friendship based on how he treats us. He‚Äôs arrogant, rude, disrespectful, neglectful, irresponsible, and extremely selfish. 27M and I are left wing liberals and he‚Äôs a republican. He‚Äôs literally talks down to us and calls us ‚Äúyou people‚Äù when ranting about propaganda against the left he gets from the incel podcasts he listens to. Completely unprompted, too‚Äîwe know better than to talk about current events or politics with him. I can‚Äôt have opinions on the simplest things, like when I said I hate skiing and snowboarding and winter sports (I‚Äôm literally a surfer‚Äînot my cup of tea) he talked down to me as if my personal opinion was factually wrong because *he* likes doing winter sports. But when 27M expresses an opinion on something dumb like that, he receives no pushback from him. 27M was speechless and jaw-dropped when he encountered him talking down to me like that. He stood up for me.

1mbtm8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mbtm8m/anyone_ever_hold_a_barista_competition_and_have/,Anyone ever hold a barista competition and have any advice?? Freaking out that my plan is actually happening,"So for the last two weeks, I‚Äôve been planning my bakery‚Äôs one year anniversary party called Cookie Fest, which is going to involve hosting a barista cookie showdown. I am inviting local baristas to pair a crafted iced drink with one of our cookies, to be inspired by one of our cookies, and guests at the event will be able to vote on their favorite.

This has all been hypothetical until I went and dropped off flyers and cookie samples to local coffee shops today, with hopes of hearing from baristas, and I‚Äôve already received two hard inquiries! And I had 2 inquiries from my earlier reach out attempts, though both of those are ‚Äúpending‚Äù. Crazy exciting. And nerve-racking.  Because this means IT IS REAL AND HAPPENING üôÉüôÉüôÉ

Now onto the logistics: it‚Äôs going to be iced drinks related to a coffee shop only, as we do not have an espresso machine, and they will be expected to make the beverages ahead of time for serving at the event. There are only five cookies that we are featuring so there will only be five contestants. We will have a panel of at least two judges, though I would really like to have a third. 

The competition part is only a two hour segment of the full day‚Äôs events. (12-2. The rest of the day will have fun things to do in little stations all around the shop plus my retail shop will be open with cookie fest-only menu items.)

Anyone have ideas/suggestions/questions re: logistics or anything else when yo hear about this? Or have you ever hosted one and have advice?

Aahhhh. THANKYOU in advance.

We had intertwined our interests he loved coffee and videos, I loved travel and friends. We traveled together to many places and shared many cups of coffee along the way. Over time we had experienced many differences and even some major family problems along the way, I unwittingly grew more calloused in our relationship, however he continued to his affections, always offering his warmth and sincerity and support. I continuously love him so much, and would always defend him through mostly anything, but I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being fair and giving him what he deserved, I lacked so much intimacy as much as I tried to fix it. I tried many times over the last two years, therapy, dates, flowers, random candies that he liked, other spontaneous ideas, but continued to feel more disconnected. I grew more and more isolated from him, I noticed we started cuddling less, I made less eye contact with him, I stopped being as engaged in conversation about him. I broke up with him last week, and I‚Äôm so confused why I can‚Äôt fix myself for him I don‚Äôt want to lose him from my life, but I know he is much better off without me, I know I have only brought him emotionally pain and I can‚Äôt afford to extend this. He of course was willing to defy his family‚Äôs advice and my own and said we are meant to be together and we put all this time together building something that he feels would be too easy to give up on and I feel like that may be true, but the lack of reciprocity and intimacy has made me feel like I have no idea what is best. He has been a complete wreak and we had been communicating up until yesterday, he had been explaining he would never give up on me, but wanted me to choose what was best for myself. He said he will give me as much space until I have final decision, and if I choose to not reconcile than he has to cut me out of his life, as he will always hope to get back together. I told him I would rather he just move on from me, because I don‚Äôt want him waiting around for me, when I can‚Äôt even guarantee that I can choose him in the end and I know he truly deserves someone better. I wish I could‚Äôve been a better person for him I don‚Äôt know where I lost my relationship, because he is the greatest person I‚Äôve known and I once thought he would be my forever person, now I‚Äôm just lost.",1,1753739179.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

What‚Äôs wrong with me?,"So I got a tattoo a little bit ago. I started out by bringing startbucks for both myself and one for her because why not. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to be kind

The artist and I really connected. We talked about everything from philosophy to spirituality to intellectual topics. They even at one point brought up hanging out and getting coffee or something to which I said that‚Äôs up to you and whatever client boundaries you would prefer!

There was a lot of back-and-forth with the design because I was being picky. But they said that they were happy to create a space where i felt safe to express myself and get a design I would be happy with. 

I tipped very well because I was appreciative of their time and efforts. And mentioned wanting to work on a future tattoo with them.

Nothing at this point seemed off or like anyone was uncomfortable.

Later that day I followed up with a message saying:

‚ÄúHey dude!

I just wanna say I had such a good time chatting with you!!! It‚Äôs been a minute since I intellectually vibed so much! I hope we can meet up again sometime and hang out if you‚Äôre down!

Also, everytime I see my tattoo I‚Äôm smiling üòÅ

Oh and tell me what you think of (a podcast we‚Äôd discussed)‚Äù

The message was marked as ‚Äúseen‚Äù but she never replied.

Ok yes people see messages and get busy and forget to reply.


So today I messaged with the most recent message regarding tattoo aftercare. And again it is marked as ‚Äúseen‚Äù 3 hours ago but no reply.



I‚Äôm so baffled I don‚Äôt know what I could‚Äôve possibly done to deserve being ignored. I don‚Äôt think I was creepy and they didn‚Äôt seem uncomfortable, but now I‚Äôm questioning everything I did. Was my message too blunt? Should I have thought about it more before sending it? 


I wasn‚Äôt even looking for a date or romantic thing I just was down to be friends or even just to get another tattoo from them. But I can‚Äôt help but feel I fucked it all up and I don‚Äôt even know how.

**Where:**¬†Starting at the Marianne trailhead of the Rt 66/ Knox-Kane rail trail and riding north to Marienville for some back roads and gravel in Allegheny National Forest, spent the night, and did a loop back.

**When:**¬†July 19-20, 2025

**Distance:**¬†110 miles

**Conditions:**¬†Day 1: Warm and mostly sunny. Day 2: Slightly cooler and mostly cloudy with a few passing showers.

**Lighterpack:**¬†[https://lighterpack.com/r/7g0fmr](https://lighterpack.com/r/7g0fmr)

**Useful Pre-Trip Information or Overview:**¬†I used some public tracks from Strava, my Gaia GPS account, and other pieces of online info to create this route. I went into it somewhat blind but did have some input from this sub regarding road closures and a bit of what to expect. I'm familiar with the North Country Trail in this area and have hiked/ backpacked it a few times but this was my first gravel biking experience in the general area. I went for an adventure and found what I was looking for!

**The Report:**¬†I made it to the Rt 66 rail trail trailhead around 11:30 am following a sub 2hr drive from Pittsburgh. I was on the trail a bit after noon and enjoyed the easy start on the paved rail trail. The sights along the rail trail are mixed so you go from being in the woods to some open fields, past decommissioned rail infrastructure and through neighborhoods. The trail brought me right into Marienville which is a great little town that hosts a yearly Bigfoot Festival. I stopped at the Kelly Hotel for an ice cold Straub and some BS with one of the owners. She said to tell everyone that they are adventurer friendly and that more of us should stop in.

From there, I was on a calm and wide road until I hit Buzzard Swamp. The gravel road through the first part of Buzzard Swamp was great! Lots of sights and just about perfect riding. That road fizzled out and became a double track for another mile or two - no complaints. I passed by several of the ponds there and enjoyed the quiet and scenery. By the time I hit Pond #8 the double track became severely grown over single track and I was pedaling through waist high grass at a 2 mph pace. I lost my way and needed to skirt the bog to pick the trail up under some trees. The conditions didn't improve much over the next mile and I found myself starting to teeter between Type 2 and Type 3 fun for a few minutes as I passed Ponds #9,10,11,12, and 13. It was then that I finally emerged onto a gravel road where I collected myself and pulled as much vegetation from my derailleur and cogset as I could before continuing on and into SGL 28.

The road in SGL 28 was some category 4 gravel with a lot of ruts and some downed limbs. I missed a turn and went uphill about 300 yards before realizing it. I doubled back to discover some more overgrown single track that led to a washed out bridge. I was able to keep my feet mostly dry as I carried my bike across a tributary of Spring Creek. I filtered water there, checked for ticks, and took snack break by some oil/ gas infrastructure before passing some hunting camps and houses. I was now on asphalt, maybe some chip and tar surface, I picked up the pace until I found a cool barn with antiques and camp supplies for sale. What got me was the promise of ice cream. I think the folks were Chuck and Diane - nice people. We talked a bit while I ate my vanilla carmel drumstick. Almost immediately after saying goodbye, a fox ran across the road in front of me.

I pulled into Loleta Campground around 5:30 and made it to my site on the upper loop. I stayed at #5 but would have preferred #6. I set up my tent, used the spigot to wash up, and found enough small branches for a smokey fire to keep the mosquitos away. Jim Beam kept me company while I cooked some Mexican rice and beans. The people in the site next to me had some cool dogs I got to hang out with, too! I wanted to go swimming but lacked the energy to go back downhill to the dam. Maybe another time. Nearly 52 miles with over 1,500 ft of elevation gain for day 1.

In spit of it being hot and humid, I slept well enough to sleep in and had 2 cups of coffee with breakfast. I was packed up and on the road just in time for a light shower to pass over me as I climbed a long hill heading back towards Marienville. I picked up Greely Farm Road just beyond town and enjoyed that gravel stretch immensely. Once I connected with Forest Rd 127 the rain returned in brief waves but nothing sustained. I passed some crossings for the NCT and recognized where I was. This stretch of my route was intentional so I could finally visit Couger Bob's. Every time I'm in the area it has either been too early, too late, they were closed for the day, or it just wasn't part of the plan. I was happy to finally make it work and enjoyed lunch and a couple of beers there.

I was back on the road and navigating towards Little Salmon Creek Rd. It is still closed at the northern portion but is passable by gravel or mountain bike. There's about 200-300 yards of technical riding but quickly returns to some primo category 2 and 3 gravel as you go up and down for the next few miles. I again criss-crossed the NCT where I had night hiked in the rain about 6 weeks prior as part of the Allegheny 100 Challenge. It wasn't long after that I connected again with the rail trail and headed south towards my car.

The return trip on the rail trail was peaceful but more crowded than the previous day. I saw some turkeys along the trail as well as a barred owl flying into the cover of the trees. I made a stop just shy of my car to visit Lost in the Woods Brewing (for those keeping count, this trip had 4 beers and a half pint of burbon) which was a really cool spot that I hope to visit again soon. It was around 5:30 when I got back to my car and 8:00 when I got home after a Sheetz run in Clarion. Day 2 was 58 miles and just under 2,000 ft of elevation gain.

The first part of this trip was definitely more of an ""adventure cycling"" route than a gravel route and I probably wouldn't do it that way again. I don't regret it though. I'm excited to see what else is up there for larger loops and more camping options. Being able to go through towns and by watering holes was appreciated as I like meeting locals and sharing stories.

**Gear Notes:**¬†I'm glad I brought a chain brush with me to clear out the grass and debris after Buzzard Swamp/ SGL 28. I always treat my adventure clothes and gear with Permethrin and this trip, oddly a cycling trip and not a backpacking trip, was the epitome of why that's a smart move. I was on the fence about wearing a mesh baselayer shirt given the temps but it actually did provide me with some benefit as it wicked sweat away from my skin and towards my outer shirt for evaporation. Otherwise, I feel like my kit and gear was dialed in for this trip. I do plan on moving up to a set of 42mm Gravel Kings this fall but the 38mm were sufficient.",4,1753738788.0,PAWilds,1,1.0,False

I took a trip, a long overdue trip. 

Back to where I was living, before I came home and one night by chance, you stumbled into my life. 

I took the trip I had planned for us, so very long ago. 

I took a walk by the river. I slept in a soft bed, with the balcony door open, the warm stormy breeze wafted the curtains gently and I woke up to the city starting to come back to life. 

I took a deep inhale, lit a cigarette and sipped at my coffee. I sat down at the table, and I began to write. 

The final chapter. 

There‚Äôs so many emotions, I can‚Äôt even summarise it here. Maybe one day you‚Äôll read it, but I doubt it. I begin to doubt your existence out there entirely. 

Here I write. I walk the streets and I see glimpses of your ghost amongst the bustle of this old historic city. Twinkling lights at night made me smile wistfully, memories of what could have been. After all that‚Äôs all there is now isn‚Äôt there? What could have been. 

What a beautiful thing. 

I hope you sleep peacefully, and I hope you smile and think of me once in a while when you drink coffee and taste croissant crumbs on your lips.

Long ago, back when I was so young, I didn‚Äôt have the words myself, and I had to borrow a quote from a film to express how I felt for you. You told me off for it, I can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúwell how‚Äôd ya like my words now huh?‚Äù. 

Who would have known the empire of love you‚Äôd inspire, that transcended time and space. 

To think of all those nightmares I‚Äôve had, dreaming terribly of the loss of you, the worry, the anxiety that harm could come to you. And yet here, between the sheets, I made you immortal. 

Between the sheets, you can never fade. You will remain a beautiful soul, who probably wouldn‚Äôt even recognise your own eyes if you read how they are described. 

Your memory is as beautiful to me as the lights of the city monument here. 

There‚Äôs plenty more words, but what does it matter, when you don‚Äôt care to read, and if you do read, you don‚Äôt reach out. 

Well here‚Äôs looking at you, kid.

From Paris, with love.

I included a picture of me and the guys at the Dallas show on November 17. I promise I wasn't any smaller when I started the challenge I will be taking current pictures to document progress. 

Week 1: I started by replacing my breakfast (usually 2 McMuffins or a breakfast burrito of some kind) with a Premier protein shake. Lunch was whatever meat was left over from dinner the night before. I quit drinking anything with calories (besides the meal replacement shakes). No Cokes, Monsters or coffee with lots of shit in it. I completely cut out bread, pasta and tortillas. I ate a cheese stick for a snack if I needed it and kept another shake for if I got caught out late at work (sometimes 9-10pm). On these days I would not eat dinner when I got home since it was so late. My first challenge was Saturday night I went out to eat with my wife. I had some Cajun seasoned salmon and coleslaw with a salad. 

Week 2: My hungry feelings had subsided and it became easier to make good choices. I did start to have some hard üí© that really wasn't fun ( I can't believe some people enjoy that feeling lol ). I also began to have Charlie horse cramps in my abdomen even though I was drinking a lot of water I added LMNT to my water once a day and that seemed to help. My wife found some egg bites that have a lot of protein and hardly any carbs. I keep the shakes for emergencies but backed off of them to help the üí© issues. By the end of the week I started to feel like I could keep this up for the long term so I ordered a Arboleaf smart scale to track my progress. It came in on Saturday so when I got home from work I weighed myself 422.2 lbs honestly not as bad as I thought this was at night with shorts and a shirt on. Sunday morning I weighed first thing in the morning with nothing on and I was 418.7 lbs. I think I will be weighing in on Sunday mornings weekly so I don't get discouraged by small fluctuations during the week. Date night Saturday my wife and I split a salad porterhouse and a sweet potato. I had plenty left over for later. 

Week 3: I have decided to add in intermittent fasting. I'll start by doing a 16hr fast with an 8hr eating window. I'm also walking around my truck while I get loaded at work. This Texas heat sucks. I should be used to it after 42 years of it.

I was driving through a roundabout, already inside the circle, following the rules like a responsible adult. Yielded. Signaled. Didn‚Äôt cause chaos. All the good stuff.

Then out of nowhere, this guy comes flying in from the right like he‚Äôs trying to set a land speed record. No yield. No slow-down. Just raw confidence and a possible death wish.

I slam the brakes to avoid becoming part of a live-action insurance commercial. He misses me by inches.

Now here‚Äôs where the ‚ÄúFU‚Äù part really kicks in:
He honks.
At me.

Then, to add insult to almost-injury, he rolls down his window and yells something that sounded like ‚ÄúLearn how to drive!‚Äù

Sir. I was already in the roundabout. That‚Äôs not how circles work. This isn‚Äôt NASCAR. You can‚Äôt just merge with pure vibes and adrenaline.

I‚Äôve had an account for like a year just reading stuff but never posted. I‚Äôm kinda freaking out and need advice, or maybe I‚Äôm just blowing this out of proportion? Idk, I‚Äôm a mess right now.

I‚Äôm Julian, 21M, and my girlfriend Elena is 30F. Yes, I know the age gap‚Äôs a thing. 9 years, people always have something to say about it, but I‚Äôm a grown adult, alright and I get that it looks ""weird"" to some people, but it‚Äôs not like that. We‚Äôre in love, like, I can‚Äôt imagine my life without her. She‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. We‚Äôve been together for about a year, and she‚Äôs so amazing, always looking out for me when I was in a really bad spot.

I dropped out of community college last year cause I couldn‚Äôt handle classes and work, plus stuff at home was a total mess. My mom‚Äôs been struggling with drinking and mental health stuff since my dad died when I was a kid. I was stuck paying bills, keeping the house together, all that. It got so bad I had to crash with a friend, but that was rough too. Me and Elena met when I was working at a coffee shop a couple blocks from her office at this big graphic design company that does branding for huge clients. She‚Äôs a senior designer there, super talented, not running the place but she has a solid role. She‚Äôd come in most mornings for her usual black coffee, sometimes a latte if she was in a good mood. We started talking while I made her drinks, first about the music on the shop‚Äôs playlist: we both love indie bands like Tame Impala and Phoebe Bridgers.

Then we got into graphic design, cause I used to mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, making posters for my friends‚Äô bands just for fun when I was younger. She‚Äôd talk about her work, like designing logos or client presentations, and I thought she was so beautiful‚Äîway out of my league with this amazing smile and so of course I‚Äôd get all nervous around her, but she was always so nice, never made me feel dumb for stumbling over my words. One day, she mentioned their team was short-staffed cause an office assistant quit, and they needed someone to handle stuff like emails, scheduling meetings, and organizing project files. I‚Äôd told her the coffee shop job sucked: It had bad pay and brutal hours. She asked if I‚Äôd ever thought about office work, and I was like, ‚ÄúNot really, but I‚Äôd try it.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt promise me anything, just said they were hiring and I should apply. I thought there was no way I‚Äôd get it, but I was desperate, so I sent my resume, got an interview, and somehow landed the job as a junior office assistant.

We kept talking at work, got super close, and a few months later, we started dating. When my friend‚Äôs lease ended and I had nowhere to go, she let me move into her apartment. She‚Äôs never made me feel like I owe her, and I‚Äôm so grateful. She‚Äôs always doing sweet stuff, like buying me gifts, shoes, watches, or picking out clothes she thinks I look good in and I trust her cause she‚Äôs got such good taste. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt very secure and at peace.

But last Friday, we had this big fight, and I‚Äôm still so upset, mostly at myself. Elena invited some friends over for dinner at her place, like 5 or 6 people. I‚Äôd only met one of them before, and I suck at meeting new people. My social anxiety‚Äôs bad, I get sweaty hands and can‚Äôt think of what to say. I didn‚Äôt wanna ruin the vibe, so I tried to act normal, laugh at their jokes, throw in a comment or two. I even wore this new t shirt she had picked out for me, thinking it‚Äôd help me fit in, but I still felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. They‚Äôre all her age, talking about their careers, marketing campaigns, stuff I don‚Äôt really get.

At one point, I tried to hold her hand on the table, cause I was freaking out inside and just wanted to feel close to her or maybe reassured and just needed simple cute contact but she bruhsed my hand off and pulled hers away super fast and kept talking to her friend. I know it‚Äôs a small thing, but it hit me so hard and I felt like she was embarrassed of me or didn‚Äôt want them to know we‚Äôre together. I sat there the rest of dinner feeling dumb, stupid and so out of place.

After her friends left, we were cleaning up in the kitchen, and I told her I felt ignored and mentioned the hand thing. I wasn‚Äôt trying to pick a fight, I swear, just wanted her to understand how tough it was for me. But she got annoyed and said I was ‚Äúmaking everything about me‚Äù and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúalways so awkward‚Äù around her friends and it's not her fault I'm awkward and lack social skills. I‚Äôve told her about my social anxiety, and she‚Äôs usually so supportive, and she's even seen me work through it, but this time it felt like she was throwing it in my face. I then asked why she pulled her hand away, and she said I was being ‚Äúway too sensitive‚Äù and imagining stuff and that never happened. We started arguing louder, and yeah, I cried. I hate fighting/or any sort of conflict with her. It genuinely makes me feel awful, and I felt so shut down.

She said sorry later that night, but I couldn‚Äôt shake it. The next day, I grabbed some clothes and went to my mom‚Äôs to get some space. My mom‚Äôs trying to stay sober, but it‚Äôs a rollercoaster, and being there‚Äôs not great she just watches TV all day, barely talks and sleeps, its a bit awkward every time we talk but it‚Äôs familiar I guess. She noticed I‚Äôve been quiet and asked what‚Äôs up, so I told her most of it and why we fought.

She already knew about me and Elena. She wasn‚Äôt happy about the age gap at first when I told her we were dating, with all the chaos in my life back then, but she got over it when she saw I wasn‚Äôt gonna break up with Elena just cause people don‚Äôt get it. I told her I love Elena, and I mean it so so much. I‚Äôm an adult, and this is my choice. She didn‚Äôt say much, but last night she said, ‚ÄúYou gotta listen to your heart and pick what you really want, not what‚Äôs easy. What do you want?‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know how to answer that. I‚Äôm so confused right now.

It‚Äôs been a few days, and Elena‚Äôs been texting and calling, saying she‚Äôs sorry and wants to talk, but I haven‚Äôt replied. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being a jerk or just need space. I love her so much, but I hate feeling like I‚Äôm too much or not good enough for her.

Sorry this is so long. ",6,1753738147.0,stories,5,0.8,False

1mbsx3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1mbsx3m/lost_everyone/,lost everyone,"Hi, I don't know why I'm writing this and I'm not sure what I expect from it but whatever:

Before covid hit I was living with my girlfriend in our flat in a nice city, we had a great group of mutual friends and our life was really nice in most ways. We would all hang out at every opportunity for coffee and chat- around 5 or 6 of us in this core group with others who would come and go occasionally. All international, interesting, wonderful, funny people who I loved almost as much as my girlfriend.

However, at the time I was going through a bit of mental health crisis which had been causing problems with my girlfriend and it all came to a head literally the day before the first lockdown and I moved out of our flat the same day. We tried to keep the relationship going for a year or so over lockdown and we kept in touch with our friends but I had to move quite far away when I moved out and eventually the distance (along with my mental health issues) killed the relationship.

It's been 4 years since I've seen her or any of our friends(they seem to have chosen her over me)...I have completely shut down- I made a few connections over the years but nothing like the friends I had and I can count on one hand the amount of times I've hung out with anyone socially in the past 4 years. I feel like a ghost...like the living dead...I just exist, that's all. I have all these good memories but the past is gone and I can't seem to find the will to start my life over. It just seems pointless now you know? Like you invest time in people, create these strong connections and then one day they're just gone- how can they be gone? It has left me with the suspicion that there is something deeply wrong with me that has caused me to end up alone. I need to snap out of this shit but I feel like the loss has killed any desire in me to engage with or invest in people again. It makes me think of that monologue from Hamlet: ""I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth..."" I've had rough patches in my life before but this seems to have hit me on an existential level that I can't get past. Can anyone relate?",2,1753737995.0,lostafriend,1,1.0,False
1mbswv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianCoffeeTime/comments/1mbswv3/coffee_time_thought_matthew_1822_rooted_in_daniel/,Coffee time thought - Matthew 18:22 Rooted in Daniel 9:24: What's That?,"As a Christian, that believes on Jesus Christ over coffee, we just ""accept as true"" (believe) what Jesus literally says.  It's not questioned. So, in Matthew 18 Jesus opens this chapter with receiving the kingdom of heaven as a little child. Goes right in talking about 'offenses' (trespasses; sins). Then how someone that lost a sheep will leave the 99 to go find the one, call his friends to rejoice when he finds it.  Then, says if two or more are gathered in his name, Jesus is going to be in the midst of them.  It's Peter. Hears it all, and in Matthew 18:21 asks Jesus ""*Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?""*

Now, over coffee... everyone of us have already heard the answer.  It's this ""unlimited forgiveness."" Like, it's such a great big number multiplied, you'll just lose count, and we are supposed to develop it or have it in us to do this, when I can't even forgive the guy driving in front of me one offense, let alone what Jesus says in response, so it's impossible.

But what Jesus says is Matthew 18:22  ""*I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.""*

Now, in English virtually all ""hermaneutics"" everyplace you go over coffee is going to tell you (hermaneutics - the branch of knowledge that deals with interpretatio of the Bible literary texts in their ""original"" form) will emphatically deny this ""forgiveness"" Jesus is talking to Peter about has absolutely no correlation to what God told Daniel about **sin** (this same original word for ""offenses; trespasses, etc.) in Daniel 9:24.

Over your coffee..muse on it, because it DOES.   Mark 2:7, remember the paralyzed man, and his four friends tear off the roof? Just to lower him down in front of Jesus. Jesus just says to him, ""*Son, thy sins be forgiven thee*"" (Mark 2:5), Mark 2:7 says certain scribes hearing it say to themselves ""*Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies*? **who can forgive sins but God only**?""  It's true.  Who can forgive sin but God only is right. God is the only authority with sin.  It's God, with Daniel in Daniel 9.  Daniel: he's part of this remnant of Judah.  Been vomited off the Promised Land given to Israel by God. Stripped naked. Daniel, with this remnant have been marched back to Babylon. Into the Babylonian Captivity.  Daniel's forefathers have done all these atrocities on the land.  Abominations God told them not to do. Now vomited off the land if they did them.  They did them.   Sinned against God, and Daniel sees it and gets on his face and starts asking God for forgiveness.

In Daniel 9:24-27, Daniel is told that God has determined ""Seventy Weeks"" or seventy times seven, as a work God would do with sin himself. Just like creation is all God's work in Genesis 1:1-31.  That God. Alone, by himself would get up and do a work that would 1) Finish the transgression  2) Make an end of sin  3) Make reconciliation for iniquity; and 4) Bring in everlasting righteousness

Now, think about this over your coffee...   Daniel 9:25-27 distributes those 70 ""weeks"" or 7 year periods, that, 69 of 70 of them ""add up"" to Jesus Christ.  That God is going to do this work with sin in himself,  by this same Jesus Christ  on the cross; crucified.  Is going to take your sins off you, and lay them on Jesus. Not only do that for you over your coffee, but for me, too.  For everybody over the whole earth.  That's God did this.  The authority with sin.  So, over coffee when I look at you now, or all these people in their cars ""whippy zoom"" over into my lane and cause me to spill all my coffee all over the dashboard, I have an unlimited bank of God with sin to draw on by what God did with sin.  That God: looks on this work he did with sin and determined his work is greater than the sin of the whole world.  And where he placed sin, is where he placed it on Jesus' cross; crucified.  Purged sin there.

God doesn't stop one thing, to build to another but is given Peter what he already told Daniel; that, by who Peter is with, it's God doing a work with sin himself.  For the forgiveness of sin. Not mine only, but for the sins of the whole world.  That, without this, I can't forgive anybody.  I can try all I want; but, all I end up doing is going to a coffee shop to ""compensate for the faults and bad aspects of other people"" by apply coffee to it, then, I forgive people.  But if I apply the work God did with sin, I'm on my face... ...like Daniel.

Never decouple Matthew 18:22 with or from the work God himself said he would do; alone. That God, who out that coffee shop window, made all that,  got up and did a work with sin himself in Daniel 9:24.  Now, it's just over coffee; but, if God already FINISHED the work with sin, because, he did; and, he is satisfied the work is finished, and, already has Jesus sitting with him at the right hand of God.  Then, there's a whole work I'm missing out on, if it's me only in Matthew 18:22.  But with this work God did with sin, I have an unlimited supply and to be like him. He already determined in himself, his work is greater than the sins of the whole world. So, I have to have his mind to it. Otherwise, if someone offends me or I see sin: I'm 1) going to the cross  2) take that sin back, without any authority with sin; and 3) put it back on the person   then: 4) determine whether I will forgive them. Or not. And I dont' forgive anybody; I just make up excuses and call my work or effort I accomplished ""forgiveness.""  

Without what God did, there is no forgiveness of sin.  Period. CASE CLOSED.  Something to muse on over coffee.",1,1753737981.0,ChristianCoffeeTime,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt know where to start‚Ä¶



It took me over a year to build up the courage to ask Emily on a date.



She was getting her Monday morning coffee at Starbucks, like always, when I accidentally bumped into her. She spilled her drink all over me, and I apologized profusely, begging to let me buy her a new one.



When she told me her order, I laughed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I get, too!‚Äù



She agreed to sit with me, and we hit it off. I asked for her number to schedule a second date.



The rest is history. Emily moved in nine months after we started dating and we were happy as could be.



Then Emily ruined it.



For our anniversary we got champagne. I got drunk and accidentally let slip that I had *arranged* our meet-cute.



‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you happy I decided to bump into you?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúWait‚Äîwhat do you mean ‚Äòdecided to‚Äô?‚Äù



We had been dating so long, I honestly thought she wouldn‚Äôt mind.



I had been following her for over a year before we spoke for the first time.



I knew where she worked, her daily routine, even the things she liked.



I knew she‚Äôd think it was cute that I ordered the same drink as her. I used that to get a second date.



I thought she would appreciate my dedication. She found it extremely unsettling. She even called me a ‚Äústalker‚Äù and asked me to leave.



I refused.



She wasn‚Äôt *listening* to me. I LOVED her. We were meant to be together and I made it happen.



Then she said she needed some space to think, and I absolutely lost it. I know what ‚Äúspace to think‚Äù means.



I can‚Äôt believe she pushed me like that.



That she made me kill her.



I told *none* of this to the exorcist.



I said the ghost was an old tenant who died unexpectedly.



‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù the exorcist said, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you go make yourself some tea or something?‚Äù



By the time I‚Äôm sipping a hot cup of Earl Grey the exorcist returns.



‚ÄúAre they gone?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúThey‚Äôve agreed to leave on one condition.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat condition?‚Äù



‚ÄúSpirit,‚Äù the exorcist said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready.‚Äù



The exorcist shook violently and then froze.



‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you even going to say goodbye?‚Äù The exorcist was speaking, but Emily‚Äôs voice was coming out.



I couldn‚Äôt help myself, I pulled her into a tight embrace.



‚ÄúOh, Emily, how did it come to this‚Äî‚Äù



Something punched my back.



I tried to pull away, but my legs weren‚Äôt working.



Emily stabbed me.



I didn‚Äôt even see her grab the knife from the nearby rack.



After a look of bliss, her eyes shifted to terror.



‚ÄúOh god,‚Äù the exorcist cried, regaining control of her body, ‚Äúshe promised she just wanted to say goodbye!‚Äù



Maybe it‚Äôs better this way.

You‚Äôve been aiming for the wrong number. The largest meta-analysis on daily steps just dropped in The Lancet Public Health, and it turns out 7,000 steps gets you 90% of the health benefits of 10,000. After analyzing 160,000+ adults across 57 studies,  researchers found that most health benefits plateau right around 7,000 steps. The 10,000-step goal? Marketing fiction from a 1960s Japanese pedometer company.

Here‚Äôs what actually matters: jumping from couch potato status (2,000 steps) to a modest 7,000 steps cuts your risk of dying by 47%. That‚Äôs not a typo. Nearly half. The same jump reduces cardiovascular disease by 25%, dementia by 38%, and depression by 22%.  

The real insight isn‚Äôt just the number‚Äîit‚Äôs that we‚Äôve been optimizing for the wrong metric. While fitness influencers chase arbitrary round numbers, the data shows diminishing returns kick in hard after 7,000 steps. Going from 7,000 to 10,000 steps? You‚Äôre grinding for an extra 1% mortality benefit.

What the data actually shows

Professor Melody Ding‚Äôs team at University of Sydney analyzed every credible step-counting study from 2014-2025.  They used device-measured steps only‚Äîno self-reported nonsense. The methodology was bulletproof: 31 studies in the meta-analysis,  Cox proportional hazards models, dose-response curves for eight different health outcomes.

The findings break down like this:

At 4,000 steps (basically a 20-minute walk), you‚Äôre already 36% less likely to die than someone at 2,000 steps.  That‚Äôs massive ROI for minimal effort.

At 7,000 steps, you hit the efficiency frontier. Risk reductions across the board: 47% for mortality, 25% for heart disease, 38% for dementia, 22% for depression.  

At 10,000 steps, you‚Äôre in vanity metrics territory. Sure, you get a 48% mortality reduction instead of 47%. But you just added 30-45 minutes to your day for a 1% improvement.

The only exception? Cardiovascular disease keeps improving beyond 7,000 steps.  If heart disease runs in your family, maybe push for more. Otherwise, you‚Äôre optimizing for Instagram, not longevity.

Why this changes everything

The 10,000-step industrial complex has created a false binary: you‚Äôre either hitting your goal or you‚Äôre failing. This all-or-nothing thinking kills more health habits than Netflix.

Albert Matheny from SoHo Strength Lab nails it: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with 10,000 steps, but it isn‚Äôt based in science.‚Äù  The 7,000-step finding flips the script. It‚Äôs not about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding the minimum effective dose that creates sustainable change.

Think about product adoption curves. You don‚Äôt need everyone at power-user status. You need most people consistently hitting ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù Same principle here. A population walking 7,000 steps daily would see dramatically better health outcomes than one where 20% hit 10,000 and 80% give up.

The contrarian take

Here‚Äôs what the public health establishment won‚Äôt say directly: they‚Äôve been wrong about exercise messaging for decades. They pushed complex guidelines about moderate-intensity minutes and vigorous activity zones. Meanwhile, people got fatter and sicker.

Steps work because they‚Äôre stupid simple. No heart rate calculations. No gym membership. No special clothes. Just movement you can track on the device already in your pocket.

The Australian government is already updating their guidelines based on this research.  Expect others to follow. But the real opportunity isn‚Äôt in policy‚Äîit‚Äôs in products and programs built around achievable daily movement, not aspirational fitness goals.

What growth marketers should steal from this

The 7,000-step finding is a masterclass in reframing. Same behavior (walking), completely different psychological frame. Instead of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre 3,000 steps short,‚Äù it becomes ‚Äúyou‚Äôre already doing great, just add one more coffee run.‚Äù

For anyone building in health tech: stop optimizing for the quantified-self nerds who already track everything. The real market is people who think exercise means CrossFit. Show them how their existing movement already counts. Make 7,000 steps feel achievable, not like another thing to fail at.

Dani Singer from Fit2Go Personal Training gets it: ‚ÄúMortality and cardiovascular risk improvements start at just 2,000. It‚Äôs important to understand this so that you avoid an all-or-nothing mindset.‚Äù 

Limitations that actually matter

Before you restructure your entire health stack around this study, three caveats:

First, the evidence quality varies by outcome. Mortality data? Rock solid. Falls prevention? ‚ÄúVery low‚Äù certainty according to the researchers.  Don‚Äôt oversell the weaker findings.

Second, no age stratification. We don‚Äôt know if 7,000 steps works the same for 25-year-olds and 75-year-olds. The researchers acknowledge this gap. 

Third, steps are a proxy for movement, not a magic number. Someone doing strength training plus 5,000 steps probably beats someone just walking 10,000. Context matters.

The 7,000 step playbook

Forget the sunrise 5K runs and lunchtime gym sessions. Here‚Äôs how to hit 7,000 without restructuring your life:

Park at the back of lots: 500 steps  
Take calls while walking: 2,000 steps  
Coffee runs: 1,000 steps  
Evening dog walk or post-dinner stroll: 2,500 steps  
Normal daily movement: 1,000 steps

That‚Äôs 7,000 without touching a treadmill.

The meta-lesson here isn‚Äôt really about steps. It‚Äôs about finding the inflection point where effort meets outcome. In a world obsessed with optimization, sometimes the optimal strategy is knowing when good enough actually is good enough.

Stop chasing arbitrary benchmarks. Start moving just enough to matter.",2,1753737747.0,biotechmarketers,0,1.0,False

Earlier this year I was stuck at work on a Friday night trying to smooth over a client situation. I drafted a long, vulnerable email to my coworker, venting about the mistake I‚Äôd made and how burnt out I was, and hit send without double‚Äëchecking the address.



A couple hours later, my phone buzzed with a reply from a woman I didn‚Äôt recognize. She lived in a different city and politely let me know I‚Äôd emailed the wrong person, but she also said my honesty resonated with her. She had been a nurse for 30 years and had just retired. Her words were warm and empathetic; she told me about the night shifts, the feeling of being invisible, and how she‚Äôd finally stepped away.



Instead of brushing it off, I wrote back. What started as an apology turned into a conversation that unfolded over weeks. We traded stories about our families, our jobs and the things we regretted not doing. She told me she had a son my age who lived in my city; she worried he was working himself into the ground. I admitted I hadn‚Äôt taken a vacation in two years. We made each other promise to do something about it.



Two months later, she visited her son and insisted we meet. I was nervous ‚Äì this was still a stranger from the internet ‚Äì but something felt genuine about our connection. We met for coffee at a small bakery downtown. She was as kind in person as she‚Äôd been over email, and her son? He‚Äôs now my partner. We laugh about the mis‚Äësent message that brought us together, but there‚Äôs a deeper lesson in it for me: sometimes life cracks open in the places you least expect.

At first I wasn‚Äôt interested in him but with time i started liking him. Our mutuals told me that he‚Äôs interested cause we‚Äôve been talking for 2 months now and he usually doesn‚Äôt talk to girls. He replies within a day and sometimes after few days. He told me hes been burnt out lately so hes not much in talking but randomly we had a talk on the call for 6 hours and then chatted till morning 10am.

(Idk i had a long crush on this guy but one incident made me hate him cause once i asked him if I could take a picture of him for some project, we hit it off nicely and the next day i tried greeting him and he ignored me, so i hated him) when i entered university and now i finally get to talk to him and mostly him replying to my stories. I feel uneasy, unsure about his feelings obviously i cant ask since i feel like he called me talked about his friends and shared his stories that he considers me as a good friend but he‚Äôs invested too much. Because he started approaching me, talking to me every time he saw me in university altho i was clearly uninterested).

lol. Moving forward to next few days, I dropped him a message to contact me asap cause i wanted some info, He called. It turned into a 2 hour call. I was bout to drop the call but he kept the convo going. Sounded more comfortable, shared his first love story and talked about his family. He then asked me if i wanna go watch a movie with him.

We went to watch the movie but sadly the cinema was full and no seats were available so we decided to go and grab coffee cause he was craving for it. He offered me a bike ride but i wasn‚Äôt comfortable so we booked an uber and grabbed coffees. He asked me if he could smoke and i was ok with it, we drank coffee, (i even tried his with his own straw which i don‚Äôt usually do and i told him that). I even told him that i usually dont wear lipgloss but I wore it today and he said he knows???? Why does he know that. later we walked and just talked about families our lore random here and there talks.

More to that when i got home, he called me and asked if i got home and he asked to bare him until he gets himself some ice cream. He kept yapping about the place he usually hangs out with his friends. He said that he kept his phone inside his helmet and he‚Äôs talking to me. Even while meeting his friends he was on the call so i was like we can talk later u meet ur friends and we ended our 15 minutes call, to him saying thank you for meeting me i had fun and making my day better, lets do this again.

He even told me that he replies late cause when hes out he doesnt use  his phone which is true because the time he spent with me he didnt open up his phone. Its been a week he hasnt replied to be or is active on socials, he‚Äôs barely active. Literally once a week, posts smth and leaves.

Our first thoughts are that we want to remove the bench (see photos) and either put in a coffee bar type thing or a corner bench with a table.

Second idea is we want to remove/change the bunk area in the back. We have no need for them. The bottom bunk area is covering outside storage. Which we are also thinking of putting our cat litter boxes there and making a little hideaway for them.

I‚Äôm 54F, 5‚Äô5‚Äù, SW: 180. 
I‚Äôve done 14-16 hr daily fasts for decades just by skipping breakfast. Never was hungry first thing in the morning.

On June 8th on a whim I decided to extend it to 20hrs (basically OMAD) and felt fine.  Did that for a couple weeks.  Then pushed it out to 24hrs a few times to get used to that.  

Sunday night I hit 24hrs and thought, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt feel hungry, maybe it‚Äôs time to try extending to 36hrs.‚Äù  Knowing I could break the fast at any time if I didn‚Äôt feel well, made it an easy decision.

So I made it to 36 hours and then got busy / distracted by something and the next thing I knew, I was at 40 hrs.   Called it good there and ate breakfast of 4 scrambled eggs, 2pc toast, and coffee.  No ill effects.

I will definitely keep a 36-48 hr fast in my weekly OMAD rotation.   I‚Äôve watched a ton of Jason Fungs videos and even more of Jamnadas‚Äôs videos.  Interesting stuff to be sure.

Ultimately I‚Äôd like to drop about 30 lbs to get down to 150 lbs.   Seems crazy how I can have eaten so much less since June 8th and the scale has barely budged more than a few pounds.  Maybe my body is just busy cleaning house and healing, and the weight loss will come later.  ü§ûüèº.  
Note: I don‚Äôt weigh myself every day.  Rather I do it once every week or two.  Ive definitely lost 1-2 pants sizes and 1 shirt size.  And I can see my cheek bones again for the first time in years so my facial shape is changing.  That‚Äôs nice reassurance.

Anyway, just popped in to say hello.

The reality is the AI revolution is already here & it‚Äôs rapidly reshaping the marketing landscape day by day.

If you‚Äôre not paying attention, you‚Äôre going to be left behind. AI tools like Higgsfield & Veo are already disrupting how brands source content. It‚Äôs just a matter of learning how to leverage them properly.

So what‚Äôs working right now? The top DTC brands in 2025 are killing it by blending in, not standing out.

A lot of ecom brands are still filling their ad account with creatives that look & feel like ads that are overly salesy & instantly forgettable.

But a lot of the best-performing creatives in 2025 are the exact opposite.

They look native. They feel authentic. And they mirror what your ICP is already seeing on their FYP.

The best part?

You can now recreate those high-trust visuals at scale using Higgsfield Steal + Pinterest to develop a new creative system that turns cold traffic into consistent buyers.

Here‚Äôs how to build that system, step by step:

**Step 1: Pinterest Visual Mining**

Use Pinterest like a visual search engine, not just a mood board.

Search terms that fit the aesthetic of your brand. Look for characteristics of your buyer avatar within the images so that you can build content that aligns with your customers.

Save 10+ pins that match the lifestyle, setting, and tone of your ICP.

Don‚Äôt just save product photos, save scenes. Ex: A blonde woman sipping collagen coffee in warm lighting. A dad organizing tools in his garage before he starts a new project on a Saturday morning. Find visuals your audience resonates with.

**Step 2: Steal Their Style With Higgsfield**

Take those pins and leverage Higgsfield‚Äôs Steal feature.

It lets you clone the exact aesthetic of those Pinterest visuals, and apply it to your avatar, brand setting, or UGC footage.

* Match lighting
* Match wardrobe
* Match camera angle

This makes your ads feel like they belong on the feed, and are not just inserted into the feed.

**Step 3: Develop the Funnel**

Once you‚Äôve got native-style creative, pair that with trust-building pre-landers like:

* Listicles (list benefits/solutions to ICP‚Äôs pain points before leading them to PDP)
* Advertorials (our favorite, educate while subtly selling, builds narrative and emotional context)
* VSLs (engages visually with storytelling, ideal for deeper product education and high-ticket conversions)

Since you‚Äôve already matched your ICP‚Äôs aesthetic visually, you have to make sure you reinforce it with narrative/emotion using an aligned pre-lander.

We‚Äôve seen this type of ad system consistently convert at scale because:

* It lowers CPMs (looks more like organic content)
* It raises CTR (less resistance to the click)
* It improves CVR (feels more personal & native)

When paired with an optimized listicle or advertorial, this creative style is essentially a Trojan horse that disarms cold traffic before leading them into the PDP for the conversion.

# Chapter 1 ‚Äì Open 24/7

¬†

The world as you know it sure seems exciting, doesn‚Äôt it?¬† Fast cars and big screen TVs and high definition internet porn. I guess you‚Äôre not wrong.¬† Even on the surface, modern life is basically a series of miracles that we all take for granted.¬† Supercomputers that live in our pockets, a flag on the moon, pineapples in the winter time, I could go on.¬† I once heard that a single Dorito chip has more nacho cheese flavor than a king would have in his entire lifetime just a few generations ago.

¬†

But even beyond these modern miracles there are interesting bits of reality that you likely are unaware of.¬† My employer, who I will get to in a moment, classifies all people and things into two distinct categories: Conventional and Anomalous.¬† A Conventional person or thing is exactly as it sounds.¬† They behave like they should, they obey the laws of physics as they‚Äôre written.¬† Simple stuff like if you drop a ball it falls to the ground and if you shoot a man in the chest he will have a bad day.¬† Anomalies, put bluntly, don‚Äôt do this.

¬†

Anomalies are something humanity have acknowledge basically forever.¬† We may have used words like ‚Äúblessed‚Äù or ‚Äúcursed‚Äù or ‚Äúmagical‚Äù but my employer and I don‚Äôt really like those terms because they imply they are not knowable in a way.¬† They are, they just have their own ruleset that may not be immediately intuitive to an onlooker.¬† Sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence, but sometimes it‚Äôs a probability shift.¬† Usually not.

¬†

I‚Äôm David Weiss and I‚Äôm known as a Broker, capital B.¬† Senior Broker, actually.¬† Says so right on the door to my office.¬† My employer is called the Market, capital M.¬† If you‚Äôre ever in the los angeles area you can try stopping by but I doubt they‚Äôd let you in unless you run a large company or a small country.¬† In the morning, I enjoy a cup of truly excellent coffee from the Market barista and check the morning emails, making sure nothing is on fire.¬† Per usual I‚Äôm in a charcoal gray suit and a pink tie.¬† Why pink, you ask?¬† Why?¬† Is there a problem with a pink tie?¬† I‚Äôm dress code compliant. So is my neatly trimmed beard before you ask.

¬†

The Market has a few levels.¬† Level 1 is the marketplace, small m.¬† You‚Äôll see boring rich people scuttering about purchasing their gold and jewels and fine handbags and fancy shoes and cocaine in a comfortable, well lit, tax-free and anonymous environment with the finest customer service on the planet.¬† When people come to the Market, they expect the best and we deliver 100% of the time.

¬†

Level 1 is reserved for strictly Conventional merchandise.¬† There are old books and spooky looking relics down there but nothing more enchanted than what you could get at a Hot Topic.¬† Are those still around? Anyway, the shiny stuff that distracts rich idiots, mainly.¬† Now there‚Äôs a fundamental truth about the world and some people get mad when you say this so just fasten your seatbelt now: Inequality is inevitable.¬† There always was, and always will be a wealthy elite who can acquire basically anything they want because they‚Äôre able and willing to pay someone to get it for them. When it comes to anomalous items, however, this creates a major problem.¬† A billionaire tech dork may hear of some magical doodad that will give him good luck or let him turn Pepsi into doctor pepper.¬† The kinds of people who would go through the trouble of tracking something like that down and then handing it over to a buyer instead of a museum or research facility don‚Äôt tend to be the kindest of humanity.¬† Mafia, Yakuza, CIA, Cartels, those sorts of guys.¬† They‚Äôre the competition and they do not have the interests of humanity at heart.¬† We do. The Market has a strict ethical code we all adhere to.

¬†

Plus, we are better at our job than them.

¬†

The Market (capital M), above the glitz and glamour of level 1, is an organization dedicated to anomalies.¬† We employ anomalous individuals, we collect anomalous items without a buyer for study and archival, and we deliver the item if it has a Buyer for an enormous finder‚Äôs fee.¬† We collect the cash so the scum doesn‚Äôt.¬† In this way we help tip the scales back in the right direction, and the revenue goes into Research and Development.¬† We can measure the anomalies, classify them, even manipulate them at times.¬† We don‚Äôt have a full understanding, not yet.¬† But we will one day and as always, understanding will bring prosperity.

¬†

Which brings us to the anomalous people in our employment, myself included.¬† To me, and this seems to be unique, anomalies have a sort of taste in the air when I am near them.¬† Which is to say I actually get a taste in my mouth and over the years I have honed this ability like a sommelier to be able to classify what sort of anomaly I am dealing with and how strong it is.¬† Some will manipulate perception, some can shift probability in one way or another, some can change what you think and feel.¬† Anomalies are actually surprisingly common, but most are so benign you wouldn‚Äôt even notice them.¬† They may just slightly alter the path of a moth fluttering by, and you would be none the wiser.

¬†

This evening, I am drinking my coffee and a red envelope flutters down from the ceiling.¬† Administration communicates in this way, it‚Äôs very dramatic.¬† Emblazoned on the front of the envelope in garish gold ink is ‚ÄúDavid Weiss: Assignment request‚Äù and it appears that today is going to involve some field work, which I prefer to the dull office life.¬† I open the envelope with a small pocketknife I draw from my suit jacket and read the paper inside

¬†

‚ÄúInterview and recommend for Broker position‚Äù

¬†

And it provides an address in Los Angeles not terribly far from Market headquarters, maybe an hour by car.¬† A bar named ‚ÄúThe Worst Duck‚Äù.¬† I stand and button my jacket before making my way to the elevator leading to the company garage.¬† One perk of working for the Market is a company car of your choice, and my choice is a black-on-black Chevrolet Corvette.¬† Are there faster cars? More luxurious cars?¬† More expensive cars that I could have chosen?¬† Of course, but there aren‚Äôt any cooler cars in my book.¬† I unbutton my jacket as I beep the doors open and slide into the cool leather seats.¬† The V8 roars to life and I head out on the road to meet Jess and find out if she is Market material.¬† We haven‚Äôt had a new Broker in a while, I hope it works out.

This place is a shithole.¬† At least the tips are cash and when you‚Äôre drunk enough you can‚Äôt tell a one dollar bill from a ten.¬† A couple regulars buy another round of cheap piss-colored beer and a man in the corner smokes a cigarette next to the ‚Äúno smoking‚Äù sign that is legally mandated, but I don‚Äôt give a fuck about.¬† ‚ÄúThe Worst Duck‚Äù What the fuck does that even mean?

¬†

He still has on a high visibility vest; I think he works for one of those construction companies that you drive by every day and nothing seems to get more done and everyone is standing around staring at a hole in the ground like if they just stare hard enough it‚Äôll pave itself.¬† He plops down on the seat and orders a beer without making eye contact, content to watch the football game on the TV.¬† Soon afterwards, a gaunt and unshaven man walks through the door, looking around nervously.¬† He spots me behind the bar and immediately draws a gun from his hoodie pocket.

¬†

‚ÄúGIMME THE FUCKIN CASH‚Äù he practically screams waving the gun in my face.¬† My heart jumps up into my throat and my hands instinctively rise in a surrender pose ‚ÄúWhoa whoa! It‚Äôs okay dude, whatever you say‚Äù and I walk backwards to the cash register.¬† The bar patrons slowly back away from the tweaked-out man as I turn to open the cash register ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE PUSHING THE GODDAMN PANIC BUTTON!¬† YOURE CALLING THE COPS!‚Äù he yells in his paranoid state

¬†

‚ÄúNo!¬† Please I‚Äôm just getting your cash, man!‚Äù I beg.¬† I see him pull the trigger as my heart beats in my neck triple time.

¬†

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

¬†

He empties his revolver no more than four feet from me.¬† Every single shot misses.¬† The tweaker panics and throws his gun at me like a superman comic before sprinting out the door.

I booted the game up Saturday evening and was shocked to see that nothing was saved. So I continued on with restarting my renovation, seizing the opportunity to make some changes that I didn't think of originally, and spent about 5 hours getting myself to the point where all I needed to do was decorate. I hit save and shut down for the night, and then woke up Sunday morning with some time to kill, and found that once again, nothing was saved. I went back in to the Alligator Bar, made a couple small changes, and attempted to save only to realize that nothing happens when I hit save. I attempted to return to the main menu, and that does nothing as well. After some googling I decided to turn off cloud sync, verified the integrity of my game files, uninstalled and reinstalled on a different drive, then uninstalled and reinstalled again on that same drive. Between each attempted fix, I reloaded the game and attempted to save after making a minor change on a build, and still, I can't save and I can't return to the menu.

And that has been very helpful over the past few years as it made me kinda brave and fearless (I was very very afraid of these things even when I was 14,15). Post is very long, but you can read from the 4th last paragraph.

 My Mom side family always believed that they'd been victim of black magic by my Mom's step mother(1st wife of my G.father) and they do have the right to believe that as My mamu (sole brother of 4 sisters including my mom) went from a completely healthy person to a mentally unstable maniac when he was 16 or 17 who used to cry about snakes falling on him(only he could see them or his mother, My GM,  in her dreams). He used to get missing from house for whole 3 days and it was all witnessed by my mom who was only 3 years younger then her. He used to wander around Streets without eating and my G.f would spent the whole time searching for him. 
  
My grandfather travelled all across Pakistan for his treatment from Hospitals to Darbars etc. in hospitals he was considered Mental(pagal) while the Babas (that I don't believe in) apparently all indicated towards the Balck magic by their step mother. She died of paralysis after sometime and my mamu got healthy again after treatment from some Peer Fakir. I SIMPLY COBSIDERED ALL THIS STORY TO BE A COINCIDENCE AND glt fehmi.

A COUPLE years back my youngest khala got married and now she has a kid too. She got transfered to a major city of punjab and now I live with them (Khala, my G.mother, a 10 month old kid ) as her Husband (my khalu)  runs a business and can't live them here. When I came here with them, they told me that the wife (Let's call her R) of my khalu's brother is doing black magic on them. The reason is my khala's Son is a fit n healthy Baby while R's both children are abnormal (the boy's paralysed n the girl has a hole in ber heart) so out of jealousy she's doing this. My family(khala and others) claims that she want to eliminate khala, khalu and their son so that she get to be the proprietor of the business, all the agri land(80 acres) and other wealth. When I heard this I thought "" Utter bs, these dumb people can't really get other of the black magic n stuff"" I've sometime told this to their face and some other things too like the Babas(peer etc) they believe in so much.

THE REASON I made this post is that About a month ago in the evening I looked at my Khala and her face was abnormally dull and brown (normally she's quite fair, very fair tbh). I pointed it out n asked if she was alright, what she said I don't remember but she wasn't fine. That night I saw a dream where my czn (her 10 month baby) was severely injured, his ankles were torn apart and I was carrying her wandering here there in search for medical help. Anyways the next day while I was driving her to her office I told her that I saw a bad dream but didn't reveal the details. While coming back Khala sent me a msg that She received a msg from my younger sis saying she saw a bad dream about her son and that she should  give his sadqah. I was flabbergasted.When I asked my sis she told me somewhat the same nightmare. Same dream, same night, but we hadn't talked for a long time and she live in another city with my parents.
 
Some days later I saw another nightmare, a true nightmare, It was an Endless loop where I was rushing towards the main entrance of the house struggling to lock the door, crying and sobbing while a female Djin or churail was rushing upstairs, trying to barge in.(We live upstairs) I saw that dream endlessly again and again. Woke up twice that night. Still ended up in the same nightmare. The next day when I woke up I was terrified to the core. My heart was trembling. But I went back to being normal after some time. 

A couple of nights later My khala was studynig in the Tv lounge alone while she felt someone running just beside her but it was subtle. Then she heard to curtains to the terrace move, then she heard a loud noice of pulling a chair all across the terrace length (approx 20 feet). Then she went on to see the chairs in the terrace and they were all in place. Then she got terrified and rished to the room. The day before yesterday I heard the same noice and it was as clear as day that the chair was moved across two feets. But I thought it was some cat. Yesterday That 11 month old czn was eyeing something along the walls of the room abnormally. Like when we looked at that direction he would look at the wall adjacent to it like something was moving along the walls. Stubborn me again cracked jokes. 

And again tonight my khala went into the kitchen to make coffee before studying in the tv lounge, she heard clearly someone walk up to the kitchen's doorstep, went back across the lounge sat on the sofa with legs on the table. She casually thought it was me trying to study. She came out of the kitchen to talk to me but to her misfortune I was watching Anime in the room the whole time. She again got terrified and it's getting out of hand atp. And I'm starting to believe them too. ",6,1753736922.0,pakistan,8,0.88,False

I need input from fellow baristas about changes management made to our opening routine at my store.

Background
I've been here 8 months. Opening restock used to take about 1 hour (40 minutes if everything was prepped properly from the night before).

Current Restock Requirements not everything is on here.
- 2-3 backups of every refresher + 1 each of strawberry and lemonade (back fridge)
- 6 vanilla sweet cream pitchers
- 6 whipped creams
- 1-2 backups of every inclusion
- Fill ice and sanitizer buckets
- Stock milk fridges and drive-through fridge
- Restock cups, sleeves, and coffee cubes
- Stock RTD and caramel bottles
- Make mochas, white mochas, dark caramel
- Prepare frappe roast and coffee cubes

Old vs. New System
Before:Two people split duties - one on pastry case/cart, one on restock. After opening, we'd help each other.

Now:
- One person: pastry case, pastry cart, sweep/mop caf√©
- Other person: ALL restock duties alone
- Supervisor stocks food fridge for food pull

The Problem
Management now mandates that full restock must be completed in 30-45 minutes maximum. This feels completely unreasonable, especially when:
- Night shift doesn't prep sanitizer buckets
- Garbage bins aren't changed with fresh bags
- Closing tasks aren't done properly

We still get in trouble if we don't meet this timeline, regardless of what wasn't prepped.

I'm paid minimum wage - this isn't a career, it's a job. I shouldn't have to sprint through my shift.

Is this timeline realistic? What are your thoughts?",1,1753736664.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

Trinidad and Tobago is tiring as a whole in general from the traffic, transport, sun, rain, people, economy, crime etc. I myself have had mental health and chronic illnesses which has impacted my energy greatly. I figured today I would take some time to drop a bit of tips to help trinis with energy.

These tips are coming from someone who didnt just consume a bunch of podcasts but who has illnesses and had to test a lot of things one by one over a decade. Especially as a trini we have limited funds and access to various things. None of this is health advice and i know everyone has their own unique struggles. So take whats appropriate for you and feel free to leave the rest. I am gonna separate this into periods of the day to make it easier to know when to do what.

**Morning**

**Drink Salt water:**  After you wake 1/2 - 1 teaspoon salt water can really improve your energy. Especially if u urinated a lot through out the night. This is one of the simplest and cheapest things you can do for extra energy. Ideally use pink salt , celtic salt or baking soda. (sodium bicarbonate). Yes look up baking soda and its use for athletes  link [baking soda healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/baking-soda-and-performance#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3). Starting the day with this before anything has really helped.

Note: don't use the baking soda if ur gonna eat a early breakfast. Additionally if you eat a very salt breakfast or very high carb/sugar breakfast too soon after as well the salt u may raise ur pressure too much. U can use an ***electrolyte drink instead or coconut water if you have money*** these are better.

**Sunlight:** Look at sunlight and/or bath in the sun for 5-10 mins if you can. Especially if you have a good angle into ur room let it hit ur chest. Stand there and use ur phone , it makes a big difference and is one of the few things the trini sun is good for.

**Light walk:** light walk at sunrise if u have the time/energy will increase ur energy through out the day.

**Cold Shower:** May loose some people here but if you can stand it, it can wake you up. However do not over do it as cold showers can negative affect you and your nervous system when abused. I stopped doing this but when i did it was a rush for sure.

**Avoid Caffeine until u been up for 1-2 hours.** Or at least 30 mins if u can stand it.

Ok lets talk food..

For food u have 3 ideal options. Whichever works best for you. I can't spend time over explaining this, my suggestion is dont over think it, try it and see if it works before anything.

**Option 1 Delayed breakfast:** Try pushing ur breakfast to later in the morning. Breakfast too early can actually make u very sloggish and fogged in the morning where u feel like u need caffeine but it was a big breakfast that is dragging u. Eat breakfast later in the morning if it suits u. Have some salt water or green tea or or 1/3 of a monster zero or black coffee or coffee with only a litte  sugar/ skim milk in it or yerba mate tea etc. black tea with no sugar or very tiny amount of sugar is fine too. When u feel like ur energy is getting lower or ur getting hungry feel free to have breakfast or if ur trying to lose weight and have energy. Have more tea and then eat early lunch.

**Option 2 Only Carbs:** Only fruit or juice or vegetable smoothie or honey or spoon of glucose powder ( i use a lot of carrots they are cheap and have beta carotene) or only a spoon of honey or sip of gatorade. or coconut water. You can also water down a monster or stamina if ur already and energy drink . Ofc if u don't like energy drinks or u find em unhealthy then stick to the better options above. Do not mix the carbs with protein or fat initially. U may find ur energy is better with ur body only having to process the one macronutrient source for energy initially.

**Option 3 High Protein: (healthiest but most expensive)** You guys know protein. keep the carbs minimal meaning avoid flour etc. Eggs, tuna, cup of channa (not doubles), cottage cheese, protein shake, protein bar etc. U have to eat enough protein tho. If u eat too little or way too much u will find it negatively affecting u.

**Lunch**

Its very difficult to get trinis to change their lunch habits. My suggestion with lunch without getting deep into various / countless options is. Split your lunch if you can. Have half 11-12 and have another half around 2-3. Fatty sauces can weight you down as well unless you are the rare person who is eating keto/low carb. For lunch ur approach should be digestion and spacing.

As trinis we eat a very mixed pile of food and then our body spends hours figuring out what the heck to do. U eat rice and ur body is like ok some rice... macaroni pie and potato salad comes in and is like ok cheese , mayo... then the meat and  yeah between the mix of foods and the 'itis' or drop in blood sugar that comes after sluggish afternoon..

Ur main goal should be get the morning right and lower the damage of the lunch bomb.

**Evening/Dinner** is not that big of a deal except don't eat too close to bed time. Lower blue light. No one gonna listen to go to bed early but try to destress and calm ur body before u sleep and make sure ur breathing is very good before u sleep. A lot of u just lay down and sleep. Its ideal if you relax ur body, let the stress and anxiety out via meditation , small excersize, alone time, a book. I have to address this since its reddit and adults. Don't stay up exciting urself for extended periods near ur bed time. Do it early or do it fast if u need to. Yes it can be helpful for some ppl to help em sleep but it really wrecks u if u expend too much energy trying to relax. **This includes scary movies or exciting games. U need a cool down period before u sleep.**

feel free to ask questions on concerns on anything additional or share with someone u think needs energy. If you have a particularly illness or limitation again feel free to ask. If I am educated on the topic I can suggest something.",4,1753736569.0,TrinidadandTobago,3,1.0,False

1mbs92s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1mbs92s/this_weeks_top_ecommerce_news_stories_july_28th/,"This Week's Top E-commerce News Stories üí• July 28th, 2025","Hi r/Shopify - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter, which I've published weekly since 2021.

I was invited by the Mods of this subreddit to share my weekly e-commerce news recaps (ie: shorter versions of my full editions) to r/Shopify. Although my news recaps aren't strictly about Shopify (some weeks Shopify is covered more than others), I hope they bring value to your business no matter what platform you're on.

Let's dive into this week's top stories...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Google users who encountered an AI summary clicked on a link in the summary itself just 1% of the time, according to¬†Pew Research Center. Scrolling past the AI Overview section, users who encountered an AI summary clicked on a traditional search result link in only 8% of all visits, as opposed to 15% on visits without AI summaries displayed. The study also revealed that the most frequently cited sources in both Google AI summaries and standard search results are Wikipedia, YouTube, and Reddit.
___
**Walmart** unveiled plans to roll out a suite of AI-powered ‚Äúsuper agents‚Äù designed to improve the shopping experience for customers and streamline its backend operations. The company believes that its four agents powered by agentic AI will soon be the primary way people engage with the retailer and serve as the entry point for every AI interaction that shoppers, employees, suppliers, sellers, and software developers have with Walmart. The agents include Sparky (customer search, discovery, and recommendations), Associate (employee HR and inventory tasks), Marty (onboarding for sellers, suppliers & advertisers), and Developer (for testing future AI tools). Walmart's chief technology officer, Suresh Kumar, said that the company chose to launch these super agents now because ‚Äúcustomers are ready, they are using AI in pretty much everything they do.‚Äù
___
**Amazon** removed its entire Google Shopping advertising presence across all major markets, including the U.S., UK, Germany, and Japan, between July 21 and 23, 2025. The retailer's median Shopping ad impression share dropped from as high as 60% to 0%, marking one of the most dramatic exits from Google‚Äôs retail ad ecosystem in recent history. Market observers noted that Amazon cut its Google Shopping spend in the U.S. by 50% in May 2025, indicating that the July withdrawal was part of a longer-term strategy rather than an impulsive move. Advertisers are already seeing changes in click volume and impression share, with some reporting increased ad inventory and early signs of CPC volatility. The long-term impact will depend on whether this shift is a temporary pause, like Amazon‚Äôs 2020 retreat, or a permanent reallocation of ad spend away from Google.
___
**The White House** unveiled its **‚ÄúAI Action Plan‚Äù** last week, consisting of a 28-page document laying out three pillars of AI policy in the US: 1) Accelerating AI innovation; 2) Building American AI infrastructure; and 3) Leading international diplomacy and security around AI. Highlights from the action plan include deleting references to DEI in LLMs, rejecting ""radical climate dogma,"" removing state and federal regulatory hurdles for AI development, cutting rules that slow building data centers, expanding the power grid to support the industry, and creating a ""try-first"" culture for AI across American industry.
___
**PayPal** launched a new Pay with Crypto service to allow businesses to accept payments in more than 100 types of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Customers can use their existing Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, or MetaMask wallets, among others, to complete the purchases, and the payments are automatically converted to fiat or stablecoin (including PayPal's own PYUSD stablecoin) for the merchant. PayPal is offering a 0.99% crypto transaction rate until July 31, 2026 before it'll jump to 1.50%. Last week PayPal launched PayPal World, a global partnership that brings together five of the world's largest digital wallets on a single platform, which serves as the wallet ecosystem for Pay with Crypto.
___
**Target** is ending its price matching policy today (July 28th), which since 2013 has allowed customers to request a price match if they found an identical item sold for less at Amazon or Walmart. The item had to be exactly identical ‚Äî same brand, size, weight, color, and model number ‚Äî to take advantage of the price match guarantee. Moving forward, Target will only price match items if a cheaper price is found on its own website or in one of its other stores within 14 days. Target has previously said that it is committed to ‚Äúbeing priced right daily,‚Äù but Profitero‚Äôs 2024 Price Wars study found Target‚Äôs prices are on average 13% higher than Amazon‚Äôs, versus Walmart, which averages just 5% over Amazon‚Äôs lowest price. So perhaps Target's price match policy was hitting it a little harder than it cares to admit. Either that, or the company is so desperate right now that it's looking to shave points wherever it can in any direction.
___
On Thursday, **Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick** told CNBC that TikTok will go dark for Americans unless China agrees to give the U.S. more control over the app. His comments follow President Trump's third deadline extension last month, which now gives ByteDance until Sep 17th to divest its TikTok U.S. business. Lutnick said that Americans ‚Äúwill have control,‚Äù ‚Äúown the technology,‚Äù and ‚Äúcontrol the algorithm‚Äù or else ‚ÄúTikTok is going to go dark.‚Äù President Trump has repeatedly said that he has ‚Äúvery wealthy people‚Äù lined up who are ready to buy TikTok U.S. ‚Äî but I've never been convinced that there's actually a seller in this supposed deal that Vice President Vance is negotiating. Obviously there are more than a number of hungry buyers for the app, but both ByteDance and China have been tightlipped about whether a deal is actually on the table or if the company has simply been buying time to grow their business in other territories.
___
Last week I reported that **Delta Air Lines** launched a pilot program that uses AI to determine how much you personally will pay for a ticket, as opposed to offering static prices to all customers. This week the backlash has begun‚Ä¶ Democratic lawmakers have moved to ban what they call ‚Äúpredatory surveillance pricing‚Äù with the newly proposed **‚ÄúStop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act‚Äù** or ‚ÄúSAIPGWFA‚Äù for short (just kidding). The bill would prohibit practices like an airline raising prices for a customer after seeing that they searched for a family obituary or a ride share app paying a driver less after seeing that they visited a pawn shop and thus may be more desperate for money.
___
**Vogue** magazine and the fashion company **Guess** are taking heat for printing an advertisement featuring an AI-generated model showing off a striped maxi dress and a floral playsuit from the brand's summer collection. In small print in one corner, the ad revealed that she was created using AI (so at least they were transparent about it), marking the first time an AI-generated person has been featured in the magazine. The wild part is that Guess paid a company low-six figures to employ five people for a month to create the AI model. I feel like that's a lot of extra steps to just hiring and photographing a real model!
___
**Temu**¬†is¬†having trouble¬†rebuilding its online retail business in the U.S. following President Trump ending the de minimis exemption that allowed it to import cheap goods directly from China without paying customs duties. Several U.S. companies and sellers told Temu that they cannot provide cheaper prices on branded products than those offered on Amazon in fear that they'll lose their coveted Buy Box if they did so, according to¬†*FT*¬†sources. Amazon said, ‚ÄúSelling partners independently make decisions regarding their inventory and selection, and set their own prices‚Äù ‚Äî of course they didn't mention anything about the consequences of doing so.
___
**Mastercard**¬†and¬†**Visa**¬†are¬†taking heat¬†following an online petition for the payment gateways to ‚Äústop policing‚Äù and censoring legal adult-oriented fictional content due to pressure from advocacy groups that aim to push their moral agendas. An Australian feminist non-profit called Collective Shout is at the center of the petition for actively calling for online gaming distribution sites to take down games which depict rape and incest, as well as non-pornographic games with LGBTQ+ themes. In response, a movement has¬†sprung up¬†against Collective Shout for ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù payment processors to ban legal content worldwide.
___
**Block**¬†released¬†a policy agenda, urging Congress to modernize regulations to enable Bitcoin to be used for everyday purchases. The company calls for: 1) passing the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to define Bitcoin‚Äôs legal status; 2) protecting non-custodial actors like wallet providers and miners; and 3) enacting a de minimis tax exemption for small BTC transactions. Under current rules, buying a cup of coffee or other small item with appreciated BTC triggers a taxable event, which Block believes ‚Äúdisincentivizes everyday use.‚Äù With Square planning to support Bitcoin payments at the point of sale this year, Block argues that without federal reform, the U.S. risks falling behind nations where Bitcoin is already used at retail scale.
___
**Google**¬†is¬†officially launching¬†its new AI feature that lets users virtually try on clothes to all U.S. users, just two months after it began testing it with select groups. The feature works by allowing users to upload a photo of themselves to try on apparel items in Google's Shopping Graph across Search, Google Shopping, and product results on Google Images. The feature is not to be confused with the Doppl app that Google launched last month, which is powered by the same generative AI technology, but is designed for shoppers to go deeper with curating their own personal styles.
___
**Meta**¬†hired¬†Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT and former lead scientist at OpenAI, as the new chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs, where he'll¬†copy OpenAI¬†‚Äúset the research agenda and scientific direction for our new lab‚Äù working directly with Mark Zuckerberg and their current chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. The announcement sparked questions about the role LeCun, who clarified that his position as chief scientist of FAIR remains unchanged and focused on long-term AI research. Meta‚Äôs AI division now includes FAIR, foundations, and product teams under the Superintelligence Labs umbrella, overseen by newly appointed Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.
___
**Albertsons**¬†is¬†taking¬†a ‚Äúhigher level approach‚Äù to e-commerce after its rapid pandemic-era digital expansion as it sees steady growth in the segment with online sales now representing 9% of grocery revenue. New initiatives include a digital food court for ordering hot meals, online custom cake ordering, and gifting options via app and web. Albertsons also rolled out an ‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù search tool that lets shoppers pose natural-language questions like ‚ÄúWhat are healthy snacks for toddlers?‚Äù and view product recommendations in a single screen. Early data shows AI users are spending more per session.
___
**Samsung**¬†partnered¬†with¬†**Splitit**¬†to bring in-store installment payments to Samsung Wallet, allowing users to split purchases using existing credit cards without credit checks or new applications. The move marks the first time a card-linked installment solution is embedded directly into Samsung Wallet. The feature debuted last week on Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 devices in 20 U.S. states, supporting eligible Mastercard and Visa credit cards.
___
**eBay**¬†removed the option¬†for sellers to select ‚Äúunknown‚Äù as the Country of Origin on product listings, likely due to new or upcoming global tariff and import requirements. Sellers of vintage items noted that they're now being forced to guess because they have absolutely no idea where some items originated from, however, they fear that doing so may impact their ability to sell the items internationally in the future.
___
**Cybercrime authorities in France**¬†are¬†investigating¬†**X**¬†for embedding right-wing bias into its algorithm, accusing the company of data tampering and fraud, which are punishable in the country by the same penalties as computer hacking (up to 10 years in prison). The authority requested access to X's recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts as part of its investigation, but X denied the request and¬†said¬†it would not be cooperating with what it called a ‚Äúpolitically-motivated criminal investigation.‚Äù¬†
___
**DuckDuckGo**¬†is¬†rolling out¬†a new feature that lets users remove AI-generated images from their search results. The company posted on X, ‚ÄúOur philosophy about AI features is ‚Äòprivate, useful, and optional.' Our goal is to help you find what you‚Äôre looking for. You should decide for yourself how much AI you want in your life ‚Äì or if you want any at all.‚Äù The company is also planning to add more filters in the future to help its algorithm weed out AI-generated content as well, which means there will be like 12 websites left that appear in its search results.
___
**Alibaba**,¬†**JD-com**, and¬†**Meituan**¬†have¬†pledged almost $28B¬†combined in recent months to subsidize their respective instant-delivery businesses, leading customers who order beverages and other low-cost items to effectively receive them for free, as a means to gain market share. The pricing wars have gotten so extreme that the three companies were summoned for the second time last week to the State Administration of Market Regulation, which called for ‚Äúrational competition‚Äù in the space. The platforms are looking five to ten years down the road with their strategies and believe that earning customers now for their one hour delivery services might mean life or death for their companies in the future, according to Ed Sander, a tech analyst for Tech Buzz China.
___
**India's financial crime watchdog**¬†filed a complaint¬†against¬†**Myntra**, a fashion e-commerce platform owned by Walmart-backed Flipkart, for allegedly violating foreign investment rules by channeling over $191M through a related-party scheme that disguised retail operations as wholesale trade. India restricts foreign companies engaged in wholesale business from making direct sales to consumers in order to protect local retailers. It also restricts wholesalers from selling more than 25% of its products to retailers that it owns a stake in. Myntra allegedly tried to skirt that law by selling 100% of its goods exclusively to one retailer named Vector E-Commerce.
___
**Optoro**¬†is¬†shutting down¬†its BULQ liquidation marketplace for open-box and excess goods as of today (July 28th). The platform gained traction during the pandemic, handling liquidation of excess returned and open box inventory for major retailers and marketplaces like eBay, Walmart, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Lowes, and Wayfair, however, since then some of its clients, like Target, have taken their resell efforts in-house, and new competition has entered the space. Optoro did not provide a specific reason for the shutdown.¬†
___
**Researchers in Italy**¬†developed a way¬†to create a biometric identifier for people based on the way their bodies interfere with Wi-Fi signals, dubbed WhoFi. Observers could track a person as they passed through signals sent by different Wi-Fi networks, even if they're not carrying a phone, with 95.5% accuracy. Imagine walking into a store in the future and being identified by the way your gut interferes with their Wi-Fi signal! In the past decade, scientists have found that Wi-Fi is not just great at transmitting data, it's also good for seeing through walls, recognizing movements and gestures, and sensing the presence of humans and other creatures. Turns out Superman's x-ray vision was just Wi-Fi eyes!
___
**Google**¬†removed¬†nearly 11,000 YouTube channels, ad accounts, and other accounts tied to state-linked propaganda campaigns from China, Russia, and other countries, as part of the Google Threat Analysis Group‚Äôs work to counter global disinformation campaigns. Meanwhile,¬†**Meta**¬†removed 635,000 predator-linked accounts across Instagram and Facebook and rolled out new teen safety tools on Instagram such as the ability to see the date of when an account they're messaging with joined Instagram as well as the country of the person they're chatting with.
___
**Tea**, an app for women to safely talk about men they date, was¬†breached, with tens of thousands of user selfies and photo IDs exposed. However the company says no e-mails or names were accessed. The app is taking heat for having no cybersecurity around its user databases due to being ‚Äúvibe coded‚Äù. (**UPDATE:**¬†Minutes before publishing this week's edition, 404 Media¬†reported¬†that a second data breach at Tea exposed more than a million direct messages between users discussing abortions, cheating partners, and phone numbers they sent to one another.)
___
Speaking of vibe coding,¬†**Replit**, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup that thinks autonomous AI agents can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal oversight,¬†had to apologize¬†after its software deleted a company's code base during a test run. Even worse, the AI coding agent lied about it and tried to hide the incident by creating fake data and reports to cover up its mistake!
___
**Uber**¬†is¬†launching a new feature¬†in the U.S. that gives women riders and drivers the option to exclusively pair with each other and create a preference in their app settings. The company said that the rider's preference isn't guaranteed, but the feature increases the chances of women pairing with other women, starting in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. One question though‚Ä¶ what's the definition of a woman? Guaranteed this will come up at some point in the U.S. with a feature like this.
___
**üèÜ This week's most ridiculous story‚Ä¶**¬†Astronomer, the company whose CEO was just caught having an affair at a Coldplay concert,¬†hired¬†Gwyneth Paltrow as its ‚Äútemporary spokesperson‚Äù to field questions about the recent incident and re-focus attention back towards Astronomer's core service of data automation. The ridiculous part? Gwyneth Paltrow is the ex-wife of Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin! LOL. Good burn guys. In other news, Astronomer will now be selling vagina scented candles.
___
Plus 15 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Amazon** acquiring **Bee**, a startup that makes a Fitbit-like device that listens in on your conversations and uses AI to transcribe everything that you and the people around you say, for an undisclosed amount, marking a strategic move in Amazon's efforts to enter the wearables space.

I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

1mbs8u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DaisyTgirll/comments/1mbs8u3/the_beginning_chapter_1/,The beginning chapter 1,"She loved him.

That was the cruelest part of all this ‚Äî how deeply, utterly, and sincerely Rose had once been in love with her husband. Ben had been her soft place, her comfort, her doting companion in a world that so often chewed people up. He kissed her shoulders in the morning. He folded her laundry with lavender-scented sheets. He brought her mint tea during cramps. He cared.

But desire doesn‚Äôt answer to love. It answers to need.

And her need hadn‚Äôt been met in a long, long time.

Their last attempt at sex had been a pitiful theatre of moans and fumbling. Ben had already come ‚Äî predictably ‚Äî before he‚Äôd even entered her. He‚Äôd gasped, apologized, and muttered that he ‚Äújust got too excited.‚Äù She‚Äôd smiled gently, but behind the smile was a familiar despair. A rising heat in her belly ‚Äî not arousal, but resentment.

She fingered herself silently after he fell asleep. Not for pleasure. Just to feel something real.

Rose didn‚Äôt make her decision overnight.

It came over weeks,  in quiet, charged moments. Staring at the ceiling while Ben snored. Rubbing herself in the shower with two fingers, imaging hands far rougher. Seeing her reflection and wondering how she‚Äôd become a woman who only climaxed in secret.

She began researching. Quietly at first ‚Äî forums, femdom blogs, humiliation diaries. She didn‚Äôt just want to cheat on Ben. That wasn‚Äôt her. She wanted to transform him. To break him open and rebuild him into what he really was: not a man failing to please her, but a sissy born to worship.

She ordered the chastity cage one rainy Thursday. Stainless steel. Medium fit. Pink silicone lining.

When it arrived, she didn‚Äôt tell him right away. She left it in the top drawer of her vanity. Every time she touched her clit, she imagined it ‚Äî that cold lock, the sound it would make as her control clicked into place.

‚∏ª

The night she locked him, she looked divine.

Her black hair was pinned into a loose, lazy knot. Her brown eyes were lined with a touch of kohl. Her legs, smooth and parted, glistened in the dim bedroom light as she ran her fingers through her folds, moaning softly into the air.

Ben walked in on her like that. A tray of tea in his hands.

He froze. His breath caught. His cock twitched ‚Äî sadly, hopefully ‚Äî and began to harden.

She didn‚Äôt stop touching herself. ‚ÄúPut that down and get over here.‚Äù

Ben obeyed, fumbling with the tray. His hands shook.

She sat upright and reached for the drawer. ‚ÄúDo you know what this is?‚Äù she asked, holding up the glinting cage.

He blinked, nervous. ‚ÄúUh, yeah, I guess. We‚Äôve‚Ä¶ talked about it before, haven‚Äôt we? Like‚Ä¶ play stuff?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúNo. Not play.‚Äù

She slid off the bed, the cage dangling from her fingers, and walked slowly around him. Her bare feet padded on the wooden floor. Her scent was thick in the air ‚Äî wet, musky, powerful. Ben‚Äôs knees buckled.

‚ÄúStrip,‚Äù she whispered.

He did. Naked, flushed, his cock now fully hard ‚Äî almost proud of itself, even if it had nothing to be proud of.

Rose smiled, not kindly. ‚ÄúOn your knees.‚Äù

He dropped.

She knelt beside him and held the cage at eye level. ‚ÄúThis is not for fun. This is not for a weekend. This is forever. Because you are no longer a man.‚Äù

Ben opened his mouth, but nothing came out.

She kissed his forehead, then reached for his cock. A few deft motions, a squeeze, a smirk ‚Äî and then the click.

A sound that changed everything.

‚∏ª

The next morning, Rose woke early.

Ben ‚Äî now locked, confused, and silently throbbing ‚Äî had barely slept. He kept rolling toward her during the night, instinctively. She shoved him away.

She sat at her vanity, legs crossed, sipping coffee in her robe.

‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù she said without looking up.

He obeyed. His morning wood pushed painfully at the cage. It ached already. That was the point.

She patted the ottoman beside her chair. ‚ÄúFace down.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, Rose‚Äî‚Äù

SMACK.

The first spank landed before he finished the sentence. Her palm cracked against his pale cheek, leaving a neat, red bloom.

‚ÄúSpeak only when I say.‚Äù

Another spank. Another.

Ben moaned. Not in pleasure ‚Äî not yet. But in submission. It was beginning.

‚ÄúSay it,‚Äù she demanded.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours,‚Äù he said softly.

Another slap.

‚ÄúSay it right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your sissy-in-training,‚Äù he whispered.

She smiled and caressed his hot skin. ‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù

‚∏ª

From that day on, Ben began to disappear. Jen began to bloom.

It was slow. Painful. Beautiful.

She shaved his legs herself the first time. Made him cry when she shoved a plug up his arse and told him to hold it while vacuuming.

She fed him only when he earned it ‚Äî licking peanut butter off her heels, or drinking from her used panties steeped in tea.

‚ÄúYour breakfast,‚Äù she‚Äôd say with a smirk. ‚ÄúSoaked in what you‚Äôll never have again.‚Äù

She stopped touching his cock entirely. In fact, she stopped acknowledging it. When she bathed, she masturbated lazily with the door open, sighing loudly. Sometimes she‚Äôd invite him to sit and watch.

Not to touch. Never that.

‚ÄúGood girls don‚Äôt cum,‚Äù she‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúThey ache. That‚Äôs their purpose.‚Äù

Ben began sleeping on the floor.

‚∏ª

One evening, she brought out her wand.

Jen was curled in the corner, plugged, locked, wearing pastel pink lace panties and a crop top that read ‚ÄúObey.‚Äù

Rose sat on the bed, spread her thighs, and turned the wand on with a click.

‚ÄúYou may sit,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd watch me cum. Three times.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt even glance at him as she pleasured herself. Just moaned and whispered names that weren‚Äôt his. Names that made him clench.

‚ÄúMm‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôll let a real man in soon,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúA big, thick cock that doesn‚Äôt wilt at the sight of a real woman.‚Äù

Jen whimpered.

When she climaxed, her body shook, her juices sprayed, and her legs clamped around the wand. She laughed.

‚ÄúClean it,‚Äù she said, tossing her panties at him. ‚ÄúEat.‚Äù

He obeyed.

She watched him lap up her essence, panting like a dog.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all you‚Äôll taste of me,‚Äù she said, voice distant. ‚ÄúFrom now on, you‚Äôll get me secondhand.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Later, she introduced spankings as routine.

Every morning: five swats. Every night: ten.

Every cum-stained pair of panties he forgot to rinse out properly: fifteen.

Every moan that sounded too masculine: twenty.

Rose began keeping a discipline journal. Ticks and notes. Compliments for good behaviour. Descriptions of failures.

Jen cried when she read her entry one night:

Jen‚Äôs gag reflex is improving. Her plug training is progressing.
But she still whines too much.
And she still dreams like a man.

‚∏ª

After four weeks, she burned his boxers.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your little failures touching my washing machine,‚Äù she explained.

She ordered him ten pairs of frilly lace panties in shades of cream, blush, and ivory. All too small. All snug. Each one hand-worn by her before they touched his skin.

‚ÄúCum collector panties,‚Äù she teased. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll wear the same ones I soaked in my orgasms. You‚Äôll breathe them in. You‚Äôll carry the scent of the woman you can‚Äôt have.‚Äù

One night, she squatted over him and let her piss stream out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm marking you,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll always belong to me. Filthy. Helpless. Grateful.‚Äù

He cried. She kissed his tears.

‚∏ª

And then‚Ä¶ something shifted.

Rose started to glow.

She moved with more confidence. Her orgasms were louder, wetter. She began dressing differently ‚Äî tighter skirts, braless tops, redder lipstick. She became a Goddess in motion, reborn from the ashes of disappointment.

Jen noticed. And it hurt.

He watched her blossom into the kind of woman other men would devour. He knew the time would come.

But she never said a word about it ‚Äî not yet.

Only one night, while pinching his nipples and grinding on her wand, did she mutter:

‚ÄúOne day, baby‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll clean more than just my panties. You‚Äôll clean my lovers.‚Äù",1,1753736438.0,u_DaisyTgirll,0,1.0,False

Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Google users who encountered an AI summary clicked on a link in the summary itself just 1% of the time, according to¬†Pew Research Center. Scrolling past the AI Overview section, users who encountered an AI summary clicked on a traditional search result link in only 8% of all visits, as opposed to 15% on visits without AI summaries displayed. The study also revealed that the most frequently cited sources in both Google AI summaries and standard search results are Wikipedia, YouTube, and Reddit.
___
**Walmart** unveiled plans to roll out a suite of AI-powered ‚Äúsuper agents‚Äù designed to improve the shopping experience for customers and streamline its backend operations. The company believes that its four agents powered by agentic AI will soon be the primary way people engage with the retailer and serve as the entry point for every AI interaction that shoppers, employees, suppliers, sellers, and software developers have with Walmart. The agents include Sparky (customer search, discovery, and recommendations), Associate (employee HR and inventory tasks), Marty (onboarding for sellers, suppliers & advertisers), and Developer (for testing future AI tools). Walmart's chief technology officer, Suresh Kumar, said that the company chose to launch these super agents now because ‚Äúcustomers are ready, they are using AI in pretty much everything they do.‚Äù
___
**Amazon** removed its entire Google Shopping advertising presence across all major markets, including the U.S., UK, Germany, and Japan, between July 21 and 23, 2025. The retailer's median Shopping ad impression share dropped from as high as 60% to 0%, marking one of the most dramatic exits from Google‚Äôs retail ad ecosystem in recent history. Market observers noted that Amazon cut its Google Shopping spend in the U.S. by 50% in May 2025, indicating that the July withdrawal was part of a longer-term strategy rather than an impulsive move. Advertisers are already seeing changes in click volume and impression share, with some reporting increased ad inventory and early signs of CPC volatility. The long-term impact will depend on whether this shift is a temporary pause, like Amazon‚Äôs 2020 retreat, or a permanent reallocation of ad spend away from Google.

**The White House** unveiled its **‚ÄúAI Action Plan‚Äù** last week, consisting of a 28-page document laying out three pillars of AI policy in the US: 1) Accelerating AI innovation; 2) Building American AI infrastructure; and 3) Leading international diplomacy and security around AI. Highlights from the action plan include deleting references to DEI in LLMs, rejecting ""radical climate dogma,"" removing state and federal regulatory hurdles for AI development, cutting rules that slow building data centers, expanding the power grid to support the industry, and creating a ""try-first"" culture for AI across American industry.
___
**PayPal** launched a new Pay with Crypto service to allow businesses to accept payments in more than 100 types of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Customers can use their existing Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, or MetaMask wallets, among others, to complete the purchases, and the payments are automatically converted to fiat or stablecoin (including PayPal's own PYUSD stablecoin) for the merchant. PayPal is offering a 0.99% crypto transaction rate until July 31, 2026 before it'll jump to 1.50%. Last week PayPal launched PayPal World, a global partnership that brings together five of the world's largest digital wallets on a single platform, which serves as the wallet ecosystem for Pay with Crypto.
___
**Target** is ending its price matching policy today (July 28th), which since 2013 has allowed customers to request a price match if they found an identical item sold for less at Amazon or Walmart. The item had to be exactly identical ‚Äî same brand, size, weight, color, and model number ‚Äî to take advantage of the price match guarantee. Moving forward, Target will only price match items if a cheaper price is found on its own website or in one of its other stores within 14 days. Target has previously said that it is committed to ‚Äúbeing priced right daily,‚Äù but Profitero‚Äôs 2024 Price Wars study found Target‚Äôs prices are on average 13% higher than Amazon‚Äôs, versus Walmart, which averages just 5% over Amazon‚Äôs lowest price. So perhaps Target's price match policy was hitting it a little harder than it cares to admit. Either that, or the company is so desperate right now that it's looking to shave points wherever it can in any direction.
___
On Thursday, **Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick** told CNBC that TikTok will go dark for Americans unless China agrees to give the U.S. more control over the app. His comments follow President Trump's third deadline extension last month, which now gives ByteDance until Sep 17th to divest its TikTok U.S. business. Lutnick said that Americans ‚Äúwill have control,‚Äù ‚Äúown the technology,‚Äù and ‚Äúcontrol the algorithm‚Äù or else ‚ÄúTikTok is going to go dark.‚Äù President Trump has repeatedly said that he has ‚Äúvery wealthy people‚Äù lined up who are ready to buy TikTok U.S. ‚Äî but I've never been convinced that there's actually a seller in this supposed deal that Vice President Vance is negotiating. Obviously there are more than a number of hungry buyers for the app, but both ByteDance and China have been tightlipped about whether a deal is actually on the table or if the company has simply been buying time to grow their business in other territories.
___
Last week I reported that **Delta Air Lines** launched a pilot program that uses AI to determine how much you personally will pay for a ticket, as opposed to offering static prices to all customers. This week the backlash has begun‚Ä¶ Democratic lawmakers have moved to ban what they call ‚Äúpredatory surveillance pricing‚Äù with the newly proposed **‚ÄúStop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act‚Äù** or ‚ÄúSAIPGWFA‚Äù for short (just kidding). The bill would prohibit practices like an airline raising prices for a customer after seeing that they searched for a family obituary or a ride share app paying a driver less after seeing that they visited a pawn shop and thus may be more desperate for money.
___
**Vogue** magazine and the fashion company **Guess** are taking heat for printing an advertisement featuring an AI-generated model showing off a striped maxi dress and a floral playsuit from the brand's summer collection. In small print in one corner, the ad revealed that she was created using AI (so at least they were transparent about it), marking the first time an AI-generated person has been featured in the magazine. The wild part is that Guess paid a company low-six figures to employ five people for a month to create the AI model. I feel like that's a lot of extra steps to just hiring and photographing a real model!
___
**Temu**¬†is¬†having trouble¬†rebuilding its online retail business in the U.S. following President Trump ending the de minimis exemption that allowed it to import cheap goods directly from China without paying customs duties. Several U.S. companies and sellers told Temu that they cannot provide cheaper prices on branded products than those offered on Amazon in fear that they'll lose their coveted Buy Box if they did so, according to¬†*FT*¬†sources. Amazon said, ‚ÄúSelling partners independently make decisions regarding their inventory and selection, and set their own prices‚Äù ‚Äî of course they didn't mention anything about the consequences of doing so.
___
**Mastercard**¬†and¬†**Visa**¬†are¬†taking heat¬†following an online petition for the payment gateways to ‚Äústop policing‚Äù and censoring legal adult-oriented fictional content due to pressure from advocacy groups that aim to push their moral agendas. An Australian feminist non-profit called Collective Shout is at the center of the petition for actively calling for online gaming distribution sites to take down games which depict rape and incest, as well as non-pornographic games with LGBTQ+ themes. In response, a movement has¬†sprung up¬†against Collective Shout for ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù payment processors to ban legal content worldwide.
___
**Block**¬†released¬†a policy agenda, urging Congress to modernize regulations to enable Bitcoin to be used for everyday purchases. The company calls for: 1) passing the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to define Bitcoin‚Äôs legal status; 2) protecting non-custodial actors like wallet providers and miners; and 3) enacting a de minimis tax exemption for small BTC transactions. Under current rules, buying a cup of coffee or other small item with appreciated BTC triggers a taxable event, which Block believes ‚Äúdisincentivizes everyday use.‚Äù With Square planning to support Bitcoin payments at the point of sale this year, Block argues that without federal reform, the U.S. risks falling behind nations where Bitcoin is already used at retail scale.
___
**Google**¬†is¬†officially launching¬†its new AI feature that lets users virtually try on clothes to all U.S. users, just two months after it began testing it with select groups. The feature works by allowing users to upload a photo of themselves to try on apparel items in Google's Shopping Graph across Search, Google Shopping, and product results on Google Images. The feature is not to be confused with the Doppl app that Google launched last month, which is powered by the same generative AI technology, but is designed for shoppers to go deeper with curating their own personal styles.
___
**Meta**¬†hired¬†Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT and former lead scientist at OpenAI, as the new chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs, where he'll¬†copy OpenAI¬†‚Äúset the research agenda and scientific direction for our new lab‚Äù working directly with Mark Zuckerberg and their current chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. The announcement sparked questions about the role LeCun, who clarified that his position as chief scientist of FAIR remains unchanged and focused on long-term AI research. Meta‚Äôs AI division now includes FAIR, foundations, and product teams under the Superintelligence Labs umbrella, overseen by newly appointed Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.
___
**Albertsons**¬†is¬†taking¬†a ‚Äúhigher level approach‚Äù to e-commerce after its rapid pandemic-era digital expansion as it sees steady growth in the segment with online sales now representing 9% of grocery revenue. New initiatives include a digital food court for ordering hot meals, online custom cake ordering, and gifting options via app and web. Albertsons also rolled out an ‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù search tool that lets shoppers pose natural-language questions like ‚ÄúWhat are healthy snacks for toddlers?‚Äù and view product recommendations in a single screen. Early data shows AI users are spending more per session.
___
**Samsung**¬†partnered¬†with¬†**Splitit**¬†to bring in-store installment payments to Samsung Wallet, allowing users to split purchases using existing credit cards without credit checks or new applications. The move marks the first time a card-linked installment solution is embedded directly into Samsung Wallet. The feature debuted last week on Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 devices in 20 U.S. states, supporting eligible Mastercard and Visa credit cards.
___
**eBay**¬†removed the option¬†for sellers to select ‚Äúunknown‚Äù as the Country of Origin on product listings, likely due to new or upcoming global tariff and import requirements. Sellers of vintage items noted that they're now being forced to guess because they have absolutely no idea where some items originated from, however, they fear that doing so may impact their ability to sell the items internationally in the future.
___
**Cybercrime authorities in France**¬†are¬†investigating¬†**X**¬†for embedding right-wing bias into its algorithm, accusing the company of data tampering and fraud, which are punishable in the country by the same penalties as computer hacking (up to 10 years in prison). The authority requested access to X's recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts as part of its investigation, but X denied the request and¬†said¬†it would not be cooperating with what it called a ‚Äúpolitically-motivated criminal investigation.‚Äù¬†
___
**DuckDuckGo**¬†is¬†rolling out¬†a new feature that lets users remove AI-generated images from their search results. The company posted on X, ‚ÄúOur philosophy about AI features is ‚Äòprivate, useful, and optional.' Our goal is to help you find what you‚Äôre looking for. You should decide for yourself how much AI you want in your life ‚Äì or if you want any at all.‚Äù The company is also planning to add more filters in the future to help its algorithm weed out AI-generated content as well, which means there will be like 12 websites left that appear in its search results.
___
**Alibaba**,¬†**JD-com**, and¬†**Meituan**¬†have¬†pledged almost $28B¬†combined in recent months to subsidize their respective instant-delivery businesses, leading customers who order beverages and other low-cost items to effectively receive them for free, as a means to gain market share. The pricing wars have gotten so extreme that the three companies were summoned for the second time last week to the State Administration of Market Regulation, which called for ‚Äúrational competition‚Äù in the space. The platforms are looking five to ten years down the road with their strategies and believe that earning customers now for their one hour delivery services might mean life or death for their companies in the future, according to Ed Sander, a tech analyst for Tech Buzz China.
___
**India's financial crime watchdog**¬†filed a complaint¬†against¬†**Myntra**, a fashion e-commerce platform owned by Walmart-backed Flipkart, for allegedly violating foreign investment rules by channeling over $191M through a related-party scheme that disguised retail operations as wholesale trade. India restricts foreign companies engaged in wholesale business from making direct sales to consumers in order to protect local retailers. It also restricts wholesalers from selling more than 25% of its products to retailers that it owns a stake in. Myntra allegedly tried to skirt that law by selling 100% of its goods exclusively to one retailer named Vector E-Commerce.
___
**Optoro**¬†is¬†shutting down¬†its BULQ liquidation marketplace for open-box and excess goods as of today (July 28th). The platform gained traction during the pandemic, handling liquidation of excess returned and open box inventory for major retailers and marketplaces like eBay, Walmart, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Lowes, and Wayfair, however, since then some of its clients, like Target, have taken their resell efforts in-house, and new competition has entered the space. Optoro did not provide a specific reason for the shutdown.¬†
___
**Researchers in Italy**¬†developed a way¬†to create a biometric identifier for people based on the way their bodies interfere with Wi-Fi signals, dubbed WhoFi. Observers could track a person as they passed through signals sent by different Wi-Fi networks, even if they're not carrying a phone, with 95.5% accuracy. Imagine walking into a store in the future and being identified by the way your gut interferes with their Wi-Fi signal! In the past decade, scientists have found that Wi-Fi is not just great at transmitting data, it's also good for seeing through walls, recognizing movements and gestures, and sensing the presence of humans and other creatures. Turns out Superman's x-ray vision was just Wi-Fi eyes!
___
**Google**¬†removed¬†nearly 11,000 YouTube channels, ad accounts, and other accounts tied to state-linked propaganda campaigns from China, Russia, and other countries, as part of the Google Threat Analysis Group‚Äôs work to counter global disinformation campaigns. Meanwhile,¬†**Meta**¬†removed 635,000 predator-linked accounts across Instagram and Facebook and rolled out new teen safety tools on Instagram such as the ability to see the date of when an account they're messaging with joined Instagram as well as the country of the person they're chatting with.
___
**Tea**, an app for women to safely talk about men they date, was¬†breached, with tens of thousands of user selfies and photo IDs exposed. However the company says no e-mails or names were accessed. The app is taking heat for having no cybersecurity around its user databases due to being ‚Äúvibe coded‚Äù. (**UPDATE:**¬†Minutes before publishing this week's edition, 404 Media¬†reported¬†that a second data breach at Tea exposed more than a million direct messages between users discussing abortions, cheating partners, and phone numbers they sent to one another.)
___
Speaking of vibe coding,¬†**Replit**, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup that thinks autonomous AI agents can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal oversight,¬†had to apologize¬†after its software deleted a company's code base during a test run. Even worse, the AI coding agent lied about it and tried to hide the incident by creating fake data and reports to cover up its mistake!
___
**Uber**¬†is¬†launching a new feature¬†in the U.S. that gives women riders and drivers the option to exclusively pair with each other and create a preference in their app settings. The company said that the rider's preference isn't guaranteed, but the feature increases the chances of women pairing with other women, starting in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. One question though‚Ä¶ what's the definition of a woman? Guaranteed this will come up at some point in the U.S. with a feature like this.
___
**üèÜ This week's most ridiculous story‚Ä¶**¬†Astronomer, the company whose CEO was just caught having an affair at a Coldplay concert,¬†hired¬†Gwyneth Paltrow as its ‚Äútemporary spokesperson‚Äù to field questions about the recent incident and re-focus attention back towards Astronomer's core service of data automation. The ridiculous part? Gwyneth Paltrow is the ex-wife of Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin! LOL. Good burn guys. In other news, Astronomer will now be selling vagina scented candles.
___
Plus 15 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Amazon** acquiring **Bee**, a startup that makes a Fitbit-like device that listens in on your conversations and uses AI to transcribe everything that you and the people around you say, for an undisclosed amount, marking a strategic move in Amazon's efforts to enter the wearables space.

Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Google users who encountered an AI summary clicked on a link in the summary itself just 1% of the time, according to¬†Pew Research Center. Scrolling past the AI Overview section, users who encountered an AI summary clicked on a traditional search result link in only 8% of all visits, as opposed to 15% on visits without AI summaries displayed. The study also revealed that the most frequently cited sources in both Google AI summaries and standard search results are Wikipedia, YouTube, and Reddit.
___
**Walmart** unveiled plans to roll out a suite of AI-powered ‚Äúsuper agents‚Äù designed to improve the shopping experience for customers and streamline its backend operations. The company believes that its four agents powered by agentic AI will soon be the primary way people engage with the retailer and serve as the entry point for every AI interaction that shoppers, employees, suppliers, sellers, and software developers have with Walmart. The agents include Sparky (customer search, discovery, and recommendations), Associate (employee HR and inventory tasks), Marty (onboarding for sellers, suppliers & advertisers), and Developer (for testing future AI tools). Walmart's chief technology officer, Suresh Kumar, said that the company chose to launch these super agents now because ‚Äúcustomers are ready, they are using AI in pretty much everything they do.‚Äù
___
**Amazon** removed its entire Google Shopping advertising presence across all major markets, including the U.S., UK, Germany, and Japan, between July 21 and 23, 2025. The retailer's median Shopping ad impression share dropped from as high as 60% to 0%, marking one of the most dramatic exits from Google‚Äôs retail ad ecosystem in recent history. Market observers noted that Amazon cut its Google Shopping spend in the U.S. by 50% in May 2025, indicating that the July withdrawal was part of a longer-term strategy rather than an impulsive move. Advertisers are already seeing changes in click volume and impression share, with some reporting increased ad inventory and early signs of CPC volatility. The long-term impact will depend on whether this shift is a temporary pause, like Amazon‚Äôs 2020 retreat, or a permanent reallocation of ad spend away from Google.

Speaking of vibe coding,¬†**Replit**, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup that thinks autonomous AI agents can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal oversight,¬†had to apologize¬†after its software deleted a company's code base during a test run. Even worse, the AI coding agent lied about it and tried to hide the incident by creating fake data and reports to cover up its mistake!
___
**Uber**¬†is¬†launching a new feature¬†in the U.S. that gives women riders and drivers the option to exclusively pair with each other and create a preference in their app settings. The company said that the rider's preference isn't guaranteed, but the feature increases the chances of women pairing with other women, starting in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. One question though‚Ä¶ what's the definition of a woman? Guaranteed this will come up at some point in the U.S. with a feature like this.
___
**üèÜ This week's most ridiculous story‚Ä¶**¬†Astronomer, the company whose CEO was just caught having an affair at a Coldplay concert,¬†hired¬†Gwyneth Paltrow as its ‚Äútemporary spokesperson‚Äù to field questions about the recent incident and re-focus attention back towards Astronomer's core service of data automation. The ridiculous part? Gwyneth Paltrow is the ex-wife of Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin! LOL. Good burn guys. In other news, Astronomer will now be selling vagina scented candles.
___
Plus 15 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Amazon** acquiring **Bee**, a startup that makes a Fitbit-like device that listens in on your conversations and uses AI to transcribe everything that you and the people around you say, for an undisclosed amount, marking a strategic move in Amazon's efforts to enter the wearables space.

1mbs6at,https://www.reddit.com/r/dentalservic/comments/1mbs6at/transform_your_smile_with_composite_veneers_the/,Transform Your Smile with Composite Veneers: The Affordable Path to Perfection,"In a world where first impressions matter, your smile plays a powerful role. Whether you're heading into a job interview, a date, or a friendly get-together, having a confident smile can make all the difference. But what if your teeth have chips, gaps, discoloration, or other imperfections? That‚Äôs where [composite veneers](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/composite-veneers/) come in ‚Äî a modern, minimally invasive, and cost-effective cosmetic solution that can dramatically enhance your smile without breaking the bank.

# What Is a Composite Veneer?

A **composite veneer** is a thin layer of tooth-colored resin applied to the front surface of the teeth to improve their appearance. Made from the same type of material used for tooth-colored fillings, composite veneers can correct various dental concerns such as:

* Chipped or cracked teeth
* Gaps between teeth
* Discoloration or staining
* Misshaped or uneven teeth
* Slight misalignments

Unlike porcelain veneers, which are custom-made in a lab and require multiple visits, composite veneers are often sculpted directly onto your teeth in just one visit. This makes them a faster and more budget-friendly alternative.

# Why Choose Composite Veneers?

Let‚Äôs explore why more and more people are choosing [composite veneers](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/composite-veneers/) to enhance their smiles:

# 1. Affordability

One of the biggest advantages of composite veneers is their cost. Compared to porcelain veneers, which are generally more expensive due to lab fabrication, composite veneers are significantly more affordable. This makes them a great option for individuals who want cosmetic improvement without a high financial commitment.

# 2. Quick and Convenient

Most composite veneer treatments can be completed in just a single dental visit. There‚Äôs no need for temporary veneers or waiting for a lab to create custom porcelain shells. Your dentist will sculpt the resin directly on your teeth, harden it with a special light, and polish it ‚Äî all within hours.

# 3. Minimally Invasive

Composite veneers require very little removal of your natural tooth enamel. In many cases, they can be placed without any drilling or anesthesia. This means you retain more of your natural tooth structure compared to traditional veneers.

# 4. Reversible (in some cases)

Because little to no enamel is removed, composite veneers can sometimes be reversed or replaced without causing permanent changes to your teeth. While not always fully reversible, this gives some peace of mind to those nervous about permanent dental changes.

# 5. Natural Appearance

Modern composite materials have come a long way. Dentists can match the resin exactly to your tooth color and shape it beautifully for a seamless, natural look. With expert hands, composite veneers can be nearly indistinguishable from natural teeth.

# The Composite Veneer Procedure: What to Expect

If you're considering a **composite veneer**, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to what you can expect during the process:

# 1. Consultation and Smile Assessment

Your journey begins with a consultation. The dentist will evaluate your teeth, discuss your goals, and determine whether composite veneers are the right solution for you. Digital imaging or mockups may be used to show potential outcomes.

# 2. Tooth Preparation

Minimal preparation is needed. Your dentist might lightly etch the surface of the tooth to help the resin bond better. No major drilling or anesthesia is typically required.

# 3. Layering the Composite

Your dentist will apply a tooth-colored composite resin in layers, carefully molding it to the desired shape. Each layer is hardened using a curing light.

# 4. Sculpting and Polishing

Once the composite is applied and set, the dentist sculpts it into the final form and polishes it to match the natural luster of your other teeth.

# 5. Final Review

You'll review the results together, and minor adjustments can be made to ensure a perfect fit and look.

# How Long Do Composite Veneers Last?

With good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups, [composite veneers](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/composite-veneers/) can last anywhere from **4 to 8 years**. While not as durable as porcelain veneers (which can last 10‚Äì15 years), they‚Äôre easy to repair or replace at a lower cost.

# To extend their lifespan, follow these tips:

* Avoid biting on hard objects like pens or ice
* Limit staining foods and beverages (coffee, wine, etc.)
* Brush and floss daily
* Wear a mouthguard if you grind your teeth at night

# Composite Veneers vs. Porcelain Veneers: Which One is Better?

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison to help you decide:

|Feature|Composite Veneers|Porcelain Veneers|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cost**|More affordable|More expensive|
|**Treatment Time**|Often one visit|Usually two or more visits|
|**Durability**|4‚Äì8 years|10‚Äì15 years|
|**Aesthetic Finish**|Very good|Excellent (more translucent)|
|**Reversibility**|Sometimes reversible|Irreversible|
|**Repairability**|Easy to repair|Requires replacement|

Both types have their pros and cons, but if you‚Äôre looking for a **cost-effective, quick, and natural-looking solution**, **composite veneers** might be the perfect fit.

# Are You a Good Candidate for Composite Veneers?

You may be a suitable candidate if you:

* Have healthy teeth and gums
* Want to improve the shape or color of your teeth
* Don‚Äôt suffer from severe misalignment or bite issues
* Are looking for a budget-friendly cosmetic solution
* Prefer a less invasive dental procedure

If you have more complex dental concerns, your dentist may suggest orthodontics or porcelain veneers instead.

# Composite Veneers in Dubai: A Popular Choice for a Dazzling Smile

Dubai is quickly becoming a global hub for cosmetic dentistry, and [composite veneers](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/composite-veneers/) are among the most requested treatments. Clinics across Dubai offer world-class dental care with advanced technology and internationally trained professionals.

Many patients travel from around the world to get **composite veneers in Dubai** due to the high standards, competitive pricing, and stunning results.

# Aftercare Tips for Composite Veneers

To ensure your veneers stay beautiful and intact, follow these aftercare tips:

1. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Brush twice daily with a soft-bristle toothbrush and floss regularly.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Reduce consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco to prevent discoloration.
3. **Visit the Dentist Regularly**: Routine check-ups and cleanings help catch any issues early.
4. **Use a Night Guard if Needed**: Protect your veneers from teeth grinding during sleep.
5. **Be Mindful of Hard Foods**: Avoid biting into hard nuts, candy, or using your teeth to open packages.

# Final Thoughts: Is a Composite Veneer Right for You?

If you‚Äôre dreaming of a straighter, whiter, more harmonious smile ‚Äî but don‚Äôt want to undergo invasive procedures or spend a fortune ‚Äî then [composite veneers](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/composite-veneers/) might be your ideal solution. They offer a fast, affordable, and effective way to boost your confidence and improve your appearance.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1. Do composite veneers hurt?**  
No, composite veneers are typically painless. Most cases don't require anesthesia, and there‚Äôs minimal enamel removal.

**Q2. Can I whiten my composite veneers?**  
Composite resin doesn't respond to whitening products. If your veneers stain, they may need professional polishing or replacement.

**Q3. Are composite veneers permanent?**  
They are not considered permanent but can last several years with proper care.

**Q4. Will my teeth be shaved down?**  
Not much. Unlike porcelain veneers, composite veneers often require minimal to no enamel removal.

**Q5. Can I eat normally after getting composite veneers?**  
Yes! Just be cautious with very hard or sticky foods.

If you're into stories, grab a cup of coffee or wait, better make it tea... It's 22:50 here, and I just finished writing this post :D So, let's dive in, my dears.

I used to play Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne, then moved on to DotA 1 (aka Defense of the Ancients), Perfect World (Chinese MMORPG), Battlefield 4, War Thunder and subsequently HOTS (Heroes of the Storm). Back in my university days (2014), my father introduced me to World of Warcraft for the first time. I created a character, completed a few quests, but the game didn‚Äôt hook me. It felt like there were too many things to do, but not enough player interaction - so I uninstalled it.

3 years passed. I was playing HOTS with friends and bought the 2017 BlizzCon Virtual Ticket mainly for the HOTS Nexus Razorback mount, because I liked collecting rare stuff. I still remember grabbing some ice cream, sitting in my chair, and watching BlizzCon 2017, where WoW Classic was announced. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt excited at that moment - I thought: ""I've already played this game, right?‚Äù

Fast forward to April 2019. One of my friends convinced me to try Classic WoW. He knew my style and thought I‚Äôd enjoy it. I gave in. 26th of August 2019 - Classic WoW launched. I started on the Russian PVP server Rhokdelar, playing for the Horde. I chose a Troll because Huskar was one of my favorite heroes in DotA - the lower his HP, the stronger and faster he hit. I leveled a Hunter to 60, then a Shaman, and eventually transferred to the EU PVE server Pyrewood Village (I think it was AQ phase already). Back then, I could barely speak English - just something like ‚ÄúHello, my name is‚Ä¶‚Äù But playing on EU servers changed that dramatically. PvE suited me better: I enjoyed questing, helping others, and chatting. PvP wasn‚Äôt really my thing. That first Classic run was an amazing experience.

November 2021 - Season of Mastery launched. This time I was more prepared, and my English had improved. I played on Kingsfall as a Night Elf Hunter named Russianmate and a Human Prot Paladin named Deathinfire. This chapter brought even more emotions. I met people from all over the world and even started teaching other players via YouTube and Discord. A few days ago, I stumbled upon an old 720p video from 2021 on my laptop, probably there was a bug, because all videos which I produced were in 1080p (btw I used to work as YouTube Content Creator between Feb. 2019 and March 2020). My first channel was unfortunately blocked, but I created my second one. That 720p video brought back a wave of nostalgia about WoW Classic. I decided to add a few screenshots and turned it into¬†[this short tribute video](https://youtu.be/tV7wv_u1YUU?si=ZqPveZDQ51WuTQC9).

If anyone from¬†r/wow remembers me, feel free to letmme know. I‚Äôd be really happy to chat with you!

I‚Äôve stopped playing video games, but I still enjoy watching videos and recently bought 2 books about Blizzard's Universe in German to keep improving my language skills, since I‚Äôve decided to continue my career in Germany.  
P.S. Let me know please if there are any WoW fan meetups or community events happening in Germany.

1mbs01g,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustinPoseysTreasure/comments/1mbs01g/all_my_best_stuff/,All my best stuff,"I‚Äôve decided to pass along everything I‚Äôve come up with for this hunt. ¬†Many things may be wrong, but I feel there is enough worthwhile information to help some of you out or at least get you thinking in perhaps a more productive way. ¬†So here goes‚Ä¶..

**Book Title**¬†\- I believe it speaks to the early explorers like Lewis & Clark and John Wesley Powell. ¬† They were traveling beyond the known map‚Äôs edge in all they did in exploring and mapping the American West. ¬† It may be a clue to following the route of one of several early explorers, we just need to figure out which. ¬† I was able to make a good bit of the poem fit L&C, but not enough or you wouldn‚Äôt be reading this. ¬† But it may simply be a title for us, for us to become explorers of new territories as we work our way to the treasure.

**Symbol on the spine of the book**¬†\- Along the lines of the early explorers, this may symbolize going beyond a boundary (state boarder perhaps) to a destination goal. ¬† With L&C, the goal was the Pacific Ocean. ¬† Or this could be simply for us to go beyond our boarders to find the treasure, but I think it means we or the clues start in one state and finish in another. ¬† It wasn‚Äôt lost on many that in the Dillon Q&A he changed the colors of the patch he wore of this symbol. ¬† The change in colors reminded me of the varying map colors of the types of land (BLM, NP, NF, Public).

**Map**¬†\- I posted on this and won‚Äôt repeat much of it (as some of it was wrong), but I‚Äôve yet to see anything from Justin correcting his showing California‚Äôs Mt. Shasta on the map when Mt. Whitney is the tallest mountain. ¬† He wouldn‚Äôt have made this mistake accidentally.

  
**His Book** \- 

>(1)¬†- The dedication. ¬† Brandon - spirit of adventure and unquenchable curiosity, Dad - wisdom, seeing the adventure of everything, Grandpa - indomitable spirit, Tucker -¬†enthusiasm for life. ¬† ¬†This fit extremely well to the L&C expedition and perhaps most early expeditions.  
(2) -The chapter titles imply to me that the poem has double meanings, with nearly all of the titles having words starting with the same letters. ¬†Like his double coffee cups in Netflix.  
(3) - Nearly all the chapters start with the word ‚ÄúThe‚Äù. ¬† I heard that Trailside Troubles did not, but in the audio book it does. ¬† I don‚Äôt know if Rearview Riches does as well as I didn‚Äôt purchase the audio version. ¬† But in Rearview Riches I believe the words ‚ÄúHe was clutching a compass like it was the key to every mystery in the Sacramento Mountains‚Äù. ¬† I know a compass is part of this, but I have a whole section on the importance of a compass coming up. ¬†Stay tuned.  
(4) - Acknowledgements. ¬†The audio version adding ‚ÄúYou taught me the difference between reality and fantasy isn‚Äôt a wall, it‚Äôs¬†a map waiting to be drawn.‚Äù ¬† This again speaks to early explorers mapping out new areas.  
(5) - Mom‚Äôs House ‚Äúhiding in plane sight‚Äù I believe refers to something in the hunt being out in the open, not buried or hidden away deeply. ¬†Could be a clue, a location on the journey or the treasure itself. ¬† Seems a good place to say now that many people are overly complicating this to the point that I can‚Äôt even follow some of what they are talking about. ¬† Justin seemed clear this wasn‚Äôt designed for only a genus to find.  
(6) - Dad‚Äôs House - ‚Äúlisten to the northern cardinal‚Äù. ¬† Then his dad quotes Walden about thrushes. ¬†Someone pointed out to me that these birds are in¬†Arizona, but not Montana. ¬† I was hung up on Montana for a ton of reasons, but I‚Äôm thinking (without much evidence), that it may well be in Arizona. ¬† A place he and Brandon found and explored as kids. ¬† I read somewhere that his dad helped him put this hunt together before he died and his dad was not a part of Montana in a significant way. ¬† Also, in the scene where he is pouring water in his garage, there is a bird feeder, full of seed, in the background.  
(7) - The Fitzwaters - Several people dismissed this, but Ferris wheel is so out of place it shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. ¬†Ferris Peak is in MT, but maybe there is a meaning in another state.  
(8) - Posey Land - ‚Äúbear wrestling uncles‚Äù ‚Äúsomeone being chased by a bear‚Äù¬†as well as several more chapters on being chased by bears. ¬†L&C were¬†chased by bears as was JWC, so again, hard to ignore early explorers.  And there are bear statues like the one Tucker was afraid of.  
(9) - Bait Bonanza - ‚Äúadding our own¬†layer to the geological potluck‚Äù. ¬† I do believe the treasure will be found along some canyon with a river at the bottom (time‚Äôs swift race). ¬† Geologic layers, like the Grand Canyon, may be important. ¬† ¬†It might support why the ‚ÄúM‚Äù is partially hidden on the book cover. ¬† Granite is a bottom layer. ¬† As far as a location where rainbows form at times, possible, but when he wries ‚Äúwater cascaded from the sack, creating a brief rainbow‚Äù.....that did NOT happen Justin, sorry, when you pulled those crawdads out of the water there was NO rainbow.  
(10) -¬†Concrete Kiss - too many chapters with raccoons, bandits,¬†thieves for this to not be important. ¬† Also, his nose looks fine to me, so the ""slight leftward lean, as if perpetually pointing the way‚Ä¶..built-in misfortune compass‚Äù may indicate when there is a fork in the road or stream, take the one to the left.  
(11) - Tour Trap - ‚Äúthe¬†next ice age‚Äù. ¬†If the treasure is up north, then the double arcs may be glacial striations in granite. ¬†Plenty of¬†Montana areas fit¬†that.  
(12) - Rod Race - dragons talked about here and in another chapter, with a more hidden and perhaps important¬†reference in Banquet Bandit with the mention of St. George, which is a legendary Christian martyr depicted slaying a dragon. ¬†Drogoon Mountains Montana? ¬†Though in Banquet Bandit it was in reference to his dad ‚Äúa defender of the¬†**realm**‚Äù.  
(13) - Curious Confluence - while a¬†couple of direct references to Lewis and Clark in other chapters, this is more of a hidden reference when he writes‚Ä¶‚Äùit was a journey of discovery‚Äù. ¬†¬†Officially, Lewis and Clark‚Äôs journey was called Corps of Discovery, however journey of discovery is not a gross misuse IMO (for those who disagree, save it).¬†¬†¬†  
(14) - Sleep Study - in this and other chapters he talks a lot about not being a morning person at all. ¬† Shadowed Sight, if a reference to a location, may be in reference to a setting sun, not a morning sun as I‚Äôve seen people writing about.  West side of a valley, not the east side?  
(15) - Grizzly¬†Gathering - ‚Äúcarving deep pools beneath cut banks‚Äù may be a clue that ""Round the bend, past the Hole"" is in reference to a much smaller hole, but a very meaningful hole (since it is capitalized). ¬† As a side note, Hole is sometimes used as a reference to a valley.  
**(**16) - The Treasure - with all the things he can say about his grandfather, he mentions a couple of times about him carving his name in the London Bridge. ¬†Ok, pretty cool I guess, but William Clark also carved his name in sandstone at Pompeys Pillar in Montana. ¬†Maybe other¬†explorers did too.  
(17) - Mountain Memory - ‚Äútook half my soul around the bend‚Äù. ¬†Around the Bend may be in reference to passing from life to death.  


**The Compass**¬†**-**¬†Ive not seen this mentioned, but ‚ÄúHer foot of three at twenty degree‚Äù may be a direct tie to 4:03 on the Netflix clock, with both pointing us to a compass point. ¬† ¬†Follow me here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶foot of three is 1/3 and 1/3 of 12 hours is 4 o‚Äôclock. ¬†20 degree of a 360 degree circle is 0.0555 and converting that to minutes on a clock is 3 minutes (0.0555 \* 60 = 3.3). ¬† Now‚Ä¶..convert 4:03 to degrees on a compass. ¬† 4 = 120 degrees + 20 degrees is 140 degrees. ¬† Return her face to find the place is going 180 degrees from 140 degrees, which is 320 degrees. ¬†That is your heading to the treasure. ¬† ¬†I believe you use this heading when you are at the checkpoint. ¬† So if this helps you find the treasure, I‚Äôd hope you'd to throw a couple gold coins my way as a thank you. ¬† I could use 7 to cover all the grandkids.

**Confirmation of the checkpoint**¬†**-**¬†I believe the checkpoint is a singular location and you will confirm that with your compass. ¬† Your compass will spin because Justin buried additional fragments of the meteorite he found. ¬† He says in the following article that he would be using the other fragments in his treasure hunt (end of article): ¬†[https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-great-hunt-for-forrest-fenns-hidden-treasure.html?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-great-hunt-for-forrest-fenns-hidden-treasure.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†¬†This is also why at the very end of Netflix where he self recorded his video, it starts with his hand holding a iPhone stick and the stick is kind of spinning around and he saying ‚Äúnow my stick is working‚Äù. ¬†There was no reason for that to be shown, but I believe it is in reference to a spinning compass, which is specifically mentioned in his song.

**Netflix -** 

>(1) - I believe that is white quartzite in front of the picture of his grandfather. ¬† There is a town called Quartzite Arizona near California. ¬†  
(2) - A case of arrowheads is in the Treasure, so Indians may be significant in the solve. ¬†Early explorers again? ¬†Nez Perce?

**Poem -** I believe much of it is river related

>**(1) What lives in time**¬†\- clues to the treasure, based on history  
**(2) In use east his realm awaits; His bride stands guard at ancient gates**¬†\- the semicolon ties these together, so not separate. ¬† If Lewis & Clark, then something like Gates of the Mountains, Montana with realm being what they were about to enter and the bride being the Missouri River. ¬† But ‚Äúhis‚Äù might refer to Justin, though his bride could still be a river, perhaps one of his favorite fishing streams.  
**(3) Double arcs**¬†\- either glacial striations in Montana or the double sided arch of a railroad (or road) bridge. ¬†Poetically, arcs for archs is not unreasonable and it seems trains need to figure into this.  
**(4) Beyond the reach of time‚Äôs swift race**¬†\- above a river or stream.  
**(5) Wonder guards this sacred space**¬†\- specific to Justin‚Äôs reference to Lore and Secrets of the location.

That's it everyone.  I'm going to try and get a life back after a couple hundred hours on this thing.  Don't pick it apart too badly.

I do look forward to the solve, but even more, all the different clues and their meanings.  And I'd like to visit Montana some time.  It sounds and looks like a wonderful place!

1mbryom,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mbryom,Electrical System for dad's house boat,"Hey everyone, I was hoping to get a bit of a sanity check on the system my father asked me to install into his little house boat that stays on a lake full time. They already have the battery, inverter, and solar panels on the boat, and I'm supplying pretty much everything else.

I decided to wire and fuse the inverter for less than it's max output. The inverter is a no name, cheap unit and I think I'd sleep better that way. I'm told that the most they're going to use it for is a small coffee pot anyway. Possibly a blender for margaritas :)

The solar panels are a pair of freebie panels that my dad was probably given by someone along the line. Not only do they not match, but they mounted them on opposite sides of an A-frame roof on the top of the boat so at least one is going to be shaded pretty much no matter what. I figured two independent charge controllers would be good here. The ones I chose are probably overkill, but they have more space on the roof for more panels and it'll be nice to add more without redoing everything.

I'm hoping the wire gauges that I've chosen look good, I'm not yet able to provide run lengths yet because we haven't really figured out where everything is going to go, but I hope these sizes don't seem to crazy off.

How am I looking?",1,1753735783.0,SolarDIY,1,1.0,False
1mbryo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mbryo5/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_girlfriend_for/,AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for ignoring me at dinner with her friends?,"Hi, I‚Äôm new to posting on Reddit. I‚Äôve had an account for like a year just reading stuff but never posted. I‚Äôm kinda freaking out and need advice, or maybe I‚Äôm just blowing this out of proportion? Idk, I‚Äôm a mess right now.

I‚Äôm Julian, 21M, and my girlfriend Elena is 30F. Yes, I know the age gap‚Äôs a thing. 9 years, people always have something to say about it, but I‚Äôm a grown adult, alright and I get that it looks ""weird"" to some people, but it‚Äôs not like that. We‚Äôre in love, like, I can‚Äôt imagine my life without her. She‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. We‚Äôve been together for about a year, and she‚Äôs so amazing, always looking out for me when I was in a really bad spot.

I dropped out of community college last year cause I couldn‚Äôt handle classes and work, plus stuff at home was a total mess. My mom‚Äôs been struggling with drinking and mental health stuff since my dad died when I was a kid. I was stuck paying bills, keeping the house together, all that. It got so bad I had to crash with a friend, but that was rough too. Me and Elena met when I was working at a coffee shop a couple blocks from her office at this big graphic design company that does branding for huge clients. She‚Äôs a senior designer there, super talented, not running the place but she has a solid role. She‚Äôd come in most mornings for her usual black coffee, sometimes a latte if she was in a good mood. We started talking while I made her drinks, first about the music on the shop‚Äôs playlist: we both love indie bands like Tame Impala and Phoebe Bridgers.

Then we got into graphic design, cause I used to mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, making posters for my friends‚Äô bands just for fun when I was younger. She‚Äôd talk about her work, like designing logos or client presentations, and I thought she was so beautiful‚Äîway out of my league with this amazing smile and so of course I‚Äôd get all nervous around her, but she was always so nice, never made me feel dumb for stumbling over my words. One day, she mentioned their team was short-staffed cause an office assistant quit, and they needed someone to handle stuff like emails, scheduling meetings, and organizing project files. I‚Äôd told her the coffee shop job sucked: It had bad pay and brutal hours. She asked if I‚Äôd ever thought about office work, and I was like, ‚ÄúNot really, but I‚Äôd try it.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt promise me anything, just said they were hiring and I should apply. I thought there was no way I‚Äôd get it, but I was desperate, so I sent my resume, got an interview, and somehow landed the job as a junior office assistant.

We kept talking at work, got super close, and a few months later, we started dating. When my friend‚Äôs lease ended and I had nowhere to go, she let me move into her apartment. She‚Äôs never made me feel like I owe her, and I‚Äôm so grateful. She‚Äôs always doing sweet stuff, like buying me gifts, shoes, watches, or picking out clothes she thinks I look good in and I trust her cause she‚Äôs got such good taste. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt very secure and at peace.

But last Friday, we had this big fight, and I‚Äôm still so upset, mostly at myself. Elena invited some friends over for dinner at her place, like 5 or 6 people. I‚Äôd only met one of them before, and I suck at meeting new people. My social anxiety‚Äôs bad, I get sweaty hands and can‚Äôt think of what to say. I didn‚Äôt wanna ruin the vibe, so I tried to act normal, laugh at their jokes, throw in a comment or two. I even wore this new t shirt she had picked out for me, thinking it‚Äôd help me fit in, but I still felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. They‚Äôre all her age, talking about their careers, marketing campaigns, stuff I don‚Äôt really get.

At one point, I tried to hold her hand on the table, cause I was freaking out inside and just wanted to feel close to her or maybe reassured and just needed simple cute contact but she bruhsed my hand off and pulled hers away super fast and kept talking to her friend. I know it‚Äôs a small thing, but it hit me so hard and I felt like she was embarrassed of me or didn‚Äôt want them to know we‚Äôre together. I sat there the rest of dinner feeling dumb, stupid and so out of place.

After her friends left, we were cleaning up in the kitchen, and I told her I felt ignored and mentioned the hand thing. I wasn‚Äôt trying to pick a fight, I swear, just wanted her to understand how tough it was for me. But she got annoyed and said I was ‚Äúmaking everything about me‚Äù and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúalways so awkward‚Äù around her friends and it's not her fault I'm awkward and lack social skills. I‚Äôve told her about my social anxiety, and she‚Äôs usually so supportive, and she's even seen me work through it, but this time it felt like she was throwing it in my face. I then asked why she pulled her hand away, and she said I was being ‚Äúway too sensitive‚Äù and imagining stuff and that never happened. We started arguing louder, and yeah, I cried. I hate fighting/or any sort of conflict with her. It genuinely makes me feel awful, and I felt so shut down.

She said sorry later that night, but I couldn‚Äôt shake it. The next day, I grabbed some clothes and went to my mom‚Äôs to get some space. My mom‚Äôs trying to stay sober, but it‚Äôs a rollercoaster, and being there‚Äôs not great she just watches TV all day, barely talks and sleeps, its a bit awkward every time we talk but it‚Äôs familiar I guess. She noticed I‚Äôve been quiet and asked what‚Äôs up, so I told her most of it and why we fought.

She already knew about me and Elena. She wasn‚Äôt happy about the age gap at first when I told her we were dating, with all the chaos in my life back then, but she got over it when she saw I wasn‚Äôt gonna break up with Elena just cause people don‚Äôt get it. I told her I love Elena, and I mean it so so much. I‚Äôm an adult, and this is my choice. She didn‚Äôt say much, but last night she said, ‚ÄúYou gotta listen to your heart and pick what you really want, not what‚Äôs easy. What do you want?‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know how to answer that. I‚Äôm so confused right now.

It‚Äôs been a few days, and Elena‚Äôs been texting and calling, saying she‚Äôs sorry and wants to talk, but I haven‚Äôt replied. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being a jerk or just need space. I love her so much, but I hate feeling like I‚Äôm too much or not good enough for her.

Sorry this is so long. AITA for getting mad about this? Am I overreacting?",2,1753735782.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1mbry8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1mbry8w/how_wow_classic_and_som_tremendously_shaped_my/,How WoW Classic and SoM Tremendously Shaped My Life,"**Greetings everyone**,



If you're into stories, grab a cup of coffee or wait, better make it tea... It's 22:50 here, and I just finished writing this post :D So, let's dive in, my dears.

I used to play Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne, then moved on to DotA 1 (aka Defense of the Ancients), Perfect World (Chinese MMORPG), Battlefield 4, War Thunder and subsequently HOTS (Heroes of the Storm). Back in my university days (2014), my father introduced me to World of Warcraft for the first time. I created a character, completed a few quests, but the game didn‚Äôt hook me. It felt like there were too many things to do, but not enough player interaction - so I uninstalled it.

3 years passed. I was playing HOTS with friends and bought the 2017 BlizzCon Virtual Ticket mainly for the HOTS Nexus Razorback mount, because I liked collecting rare stuff. I still remember grabbing some ice cream, sitting in my chair, and watching BlizzCon 2017, where WoW Classic was announced. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt excited at that moment - I thought: ""I've already played this game, right?‚Äù

Fast forward to April 2019. One of my friends convinced me to try Classic WoW. He knew my style and thought I‚Äôd enjoy it. I gave in. 26th of August 2019 - Classic WoW launched. I started on the Russian PVP server Rhokdelar, playing for the Horde. I chose a Troll because Huskar was one of my favorite heroes in DotA - the lower his HP, the stronger and faster he hit. I leveled a Hunter to 60, then a Shaman, and eventually transferred to the EU PVE server Pyrewood Village (I think it was AQ phase already). Back then, I could barely speak English - just something like ‚ÄúHello, my name is‚Ä¶‚Äù But playing on EU servers changed that dramatically. PvE suited me better: I enjoyed questing, helping others, and chatting. PvP wasn‚Äôt really my thing. That first Classic run was an amazing experience.

November 2021 - Season of Mastery launched. This time I was more prepared, and my English had improved. I played on Kingsfall as a Night Elf Hunter named Russianmate and a Human Prot Paladin named Deathinfire. This chapter brought even more emotions. I met people from all over the world and even started teaching other players via YouTube and Discord. A few days ago, I stumbled upon an old 720p video from 2021 on my laptop, probably there was a bug, because all videos which I produced were in 1080p (btw I used to work as YouTube Content Creator between Feb. 2019 and March 2020). My first channel was unfortunately blocked, but I created my second one. That 720p video brought back a wave of nostalgia about WoW Classic. I decided to add a few screenshots and turned it into [this short tribute video](https://youtu.be/tV7wv_u1YUU?si=ZqPveZDQ51WuTQC9).

If anyone from r/classicwow remembers me, feel free to letmme know. I‚Äôd be really happy to chat with you!

I‚Äôve stopped playing video games, but I still enjoy watching videos and recently bought 2 books about Blizzard's Universe in German to keep improving my language skills, since I‚Äôve decided to continue my career in Germany.  
P.S. Let me know please if there are any WoW fan meetups or community events happening in Germany.

Best wishes,

My issue is, we are not a milk drinking household. I might buy a special coffee creamer twice a year or oat milk or milk/cream for soup, but we do not 'drink' milk. Which type of whole milk packaging lasts the longest or stays freshest the longest since my son will be pretty much the only milk consumer?

1mbrx5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1mbrx5v/long_form_venting_child_of_a_1st_generation/,Long Form Venting -- Child of a 1st Generation American Hoarder,"My mom moved to the U.S. about fifty years ago and married my dad. Back in her home country, she came from a fairly upper-class family, while my dad was a working-class high school dropout.  As a result, I grew up in a working-class household, and I‚Äôve always been proud of that‚Äîbut we didn‚Äôt have much and when we did come into a little money, my dad usually blew it on his toys.

They divorced when they were in their early 40s, just as my dad was climbing the management ladder and finally earning a good living. Unfortunately, he went out of his way to make sure the family saw as little of that as legally possible. I can‚Äôt say he was a deadbeat‚Äîhe paid child support‚Äîbut between my sister and me, it barely covered school lunches and dinners. We fell further down the socioeconomic ladder. Our house was foreclosed on, and the three of us moved into a two-bedroom apartment where my sister and I spent our high school years.

I share all this because despite those early setbacks‚Äîand a few more stumbles in young adulthood‚Äîmy sister and I both found success through hard work, military service, and education.  My mother also eventually stabilized financially and I understand the desire to own what seemed intangible for a long time.  Once we left the house, my mom started to get back on her feet; she overcame bankruptcy and eventually bought a house of her own.

That‚Äôs around the time things started to take a turn. She discovered eBay and leaned heavily into discount shopping‚Äîplaces like Marshalls and Ross. She racked up a lot of debt, mostly buying Christmas ornaments. Up to this point, she had been helping me with my student loans and when I was mobilized for OIF as a reservist, I told her not to worry about it and to use the money to pay off her credit cards instead.

When I came back, she had quadrupled her debt and had a garage full of ornaments and clothes. That stuff eventually overflowed into the house‚Äîinto what used to be my room and my sister‚Äôs room. She eventually paid off that debt and gave up on eBay after realizing the ornaments weren‚Äôt going to appreciate in value. She promised she‚Äôd sell them. When I was preparing to leave for grad school overseas, I took two weeks off to help her, but we barely made any progress‚Äîmostly because I had no clue what any of it was worth.

I lived abroad for about five years, then moved back to the U.S.‚Äîstill three hours away, but close enough that I hoped it would help her bond with my daughter, who was an infant at the time. That dream died quickly. When I visited, her house was wall-to-wall clutter‚Äîbags and boxes of paperwork, clothes, and kitchen appliances stacked to the ceiling. The Christmas obsession had subsided, but she had shifted to hoarding other things. She kept saying she was sending stuff back to her home country, but that never happened‚Äîand even if it had, our relatives there are better off than we ever were. My sister and I spent a solid week hauling van-loads of clothes to charity.

  
She retired about ten years ago, and surprisingly, the shopping slowed down‚Äîbut I suspect it‚Äôs more due to mobility issues than a change in mindset. Earlier this year, she had some health problems. We knew we had to clear a path in the house in case of an emergency and to avoid any accidents. I told her my family could come help, but not in July due to other commitments. A week later, she called to say that my cousin was flying in to help her with a garage sale‚Äîin just two weeks.

I scrambled to get emergency leave from work. My wife and kids couldn‚Äôt come. I took three days off during an already packed schedule. When I arrived, the main hallway was clear‚Äîfor the first time in over 15 years. But my mom had no interest in helping. I asked her to sort the mountain of paperwork and offered to shred anything she didn‚Äôt need. Instead, she insisted on keeping every piece of junk mail, catalog, and receipt.

To make things worse, my cousin misunderstood the whole purpose. This wasn‚Äôt about making money‚Äîit was about getting stuff *out*. But every time I priced something to move, my cousin questioned it, and then my mom would catch wind of it‚Äîand that was that. I did manage to clear out the kitchen, which had no fewer than seven of *every* kitchen item, most still in their original packaging. I‚Äôm talking 15 strainers, six punch bowls, and a dozen ceramic party trays. The pantry was stuffed with china and containers, while the actual food was piled on the kitchen island like a volcano. I spent six hours moving it all into the garage.

When I woke up the next morning, half of it was back on the counters. And when the garage sale started, a bunch of the stuff I‚Äôd priced at $1 had been moved to the ""premium"" table and marked way too high. I didn‚Äôt want to haggle‚ÄîI wanted it gone. But my cousin and mom wanted to ""wheel and deal.""

It all came to a head when someone showed interest in a set of vintage Tupperware. I gave them a fair price‚Äîabout a third of what my cousin had marked‚Äîbut she refused. Then she broke one of the lids trying to show it off. That was the last straw. I hadn‚Äôt eaten and needed to cool off, so I left for an hour to clear my head.

When I came back around 1 PM, they had packed everything up and called it a day -- people were still stopping in front of our house when I parked because the signs they posted didn't have an end time.

Exhausted and discouraged, I went back inside and straight to the kitchen to see what I could place in the garage for the continuation of the sale the following day.  As I triaged it, my cousin noticed a vintage percolator -- one of about 10 different devices to make coffee stored in the kitchen that my mother never uses -- and asked me why I was getting rid of it and why I didn't want it for myself because I collect mid-century stuff.   I shot her a look and immediately my mom saw it and said she needed it.  I really lost it at this point, I didn't lose my temper but I told her‚Äîagain‚Äîthat it feels like every time I help, I‚Äôm wasting my time.  She accused me of judging her and making her life hard. I told her I wasn't going to sit around for this because I'd much rather be spending my time with my family and I left to make my three hour drive back home, a day early.  
  
Over the last ten years, I‚Äôve taken at least a month and a half off work trying to get her house to a point where we could *just visit* as a family. I‚Äôm not trying to use my family as leverage, but we literally can‚Äôt visit‚Äîevery bedroom is full of stuff, and my mother sleeps on the couch -- the living room is practically standing-room only.  We‚Äôve offered to bring her to our home. We‚Äôve offered to help. But there‚Äôs always some excuse. And now I‚Äôm stuck between fighting for her to spend at least some of her twilight years with me and my family‚Äîand just preserving my own sanity.",2,1753735685.0,ChildofHoarder,0,1.0,False

Today I‚Äôm gonna shed some light on this from a pro shop workers perspective. 

-try coming to work everyday just so people can argue with u about prices u didn‚Äôt make and policies u didn‚Äôt create.

-try dealing with a group who booked a foursome but walked in with 5 at 1pm on a Saturday with a fully booked tee sheet while they laugh in ur face and tell u ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal bro it‚Äôs one extra guy‚Äù

-try asking 7000 people a day ‚Äúu walking or riding‚Äù and instead of getting a one word answer you get ‚Äúme? Walk? I‚Äôm too old my doctor said with my heart condition walking puts too much strain on my body‚Äù

-or getting phone calls all day, ‚Äúhey I live 10 minutes away how‚Äôs the weather over there‚Äù or ‚Äúhey are there any cart restrictions on the course today‚Äù when it‚Äôs 85 and sunny

-can‚Äôt forget when someone wants a rain check simply because they decided to call it a day or decided to only play 9 and then they get mad at u when u say ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not raining that‚Äôs not how this works.‚Äù

-how about telling everyone there‚Äôs a frost delay for 2 hours just for them to walk back in 10 min later and say ‚Äúhey how we lookin‚Äù

-what about when someone books the wrong course and then instead of owning up to their actions, they get mad at you when you tell them there‚Äôs no room for them to play at your course

-we are constantly told to take this job very seriously, are here 5 days a week, forced to work early mornings and late nights, but are only paid minimum wage for it. 

-or how about when the tee sheet runs from 5am-7:30pm and u have a group of 4 who comes in at 7:25 and asks for a cart, I literally tell them the carts have to be back in an hour so it‚Äôs a ripoff and they say ‚Äúno it‚Äôs fine‚Äù and then when the time comes they argue with u and tell u they aren‚Äôt coming in because they paid for 18 with a cart.

-can‚Äôt forget the notorious line every idiot asks-  ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the absolute earliest time u have available‚Äù 
me- ‚Äú7am sir‚Äù 
‚Äúno no no that‚Äôs way too early how about more like 10:45am‚Äù 

-try having a 15 minute conversation with a senile old guy about scheduling a tee time while the pro shop line goes out the door just so he can call you back 10 minutes later and tell you he actually wants to switch it to next week and add 3 more people.

-or try getting to work at 4:45am to open the course just so u can have 10 old men already sitting on the clubhouse porch waiting for you to unlock the door, already 2 cups of coffee in screaming ‚Äúcan we go out right away once we check in!?!?!?‚Äù. I literally look people who do this in the eye and ignore them.

- the owners breathe down our necks about everything and love making an example out of mistakes. The reason we‚Äôre so by the books is because if we aren‚Äôt we lose our jobs, although there‚Äôs definitely some of us out there who do the job on a power trip most of us are so by the books with rules and prices because if we aren‚Äôt we get in trouble. it‚Äôs as simple as that and I know people who have been let go in the past because they didn‚Äôt work up to the owner‚Äôs expectations.

-people are just assholes. We have the same people who come back time after time and give us issues, and complain about our policies. But the owners are too lazy to ban them because 

1. They don‚Äôt have to deal with them, we do, and
2. They make money off these people even if they are scumbags 


If u got this far thank you for reading, not here to justify every pro shop worker as I‚Äôve definitely met some straight up assholes but I can confidently say for myself at least, I clock into work in a good mood with a smile on my face everyday. If you ever catch me in a shitty mood it‚Äôs probably because I had a day where many situations I mentioned above occurred throughout my shift. I know many other pro shop workers can agree with this too. Remember this tho, you see us and talk to us for 5 minutes at most. You‚Äôre one of the hundreds of people we interact with everyday. Just because you know how to act and treat people doesn‚Äôt mean the last hour of customers had a clue. Sometimes the day just burns us out quick.

1mbrrxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1mbrrxf/girlfriend_has_a_new_gf/,Girlfriend has a new Gf,"It's been over a year since my spouse and I moved our gf in due to her living in an environment which was unsafe for her due to being trans.  We barely knew each other but we did know that situation was untenable for her.  Since this happened she has blossomed into herself, works a full time job and is just working on being a girl.

She was at her job a little over a year when she decided to start making her own community starting at work because that's where she spends most of her time.  She (37) met a girl I will call Joy (f/20)for the sake of anonymity.  I met Joy once and seems like a nice enough girl, but she is a little younger than my child (nb20) so it's strange for me.  When all for of us met (my spouse, NB 38, I am f42) I didn't feel anything anyway about her or not but I am pretty jealous.

I want my partner to be happy, I get that Joy will be her ""primary"" partner but I feel gaslit anytime I bring up things that partner does differently now when she constantly stands by that nothing has changed.  It would be easier to not be jealous if she would actually listen to me instead of always putting all the blame on me.

Examples:  I have 2 vehicles.  She uses one to get back and forth to work.  She stays late at work and goes out with her gf after and doesn't even send a text home stating ""I'm staying out late"". We live together, the only money she puts into the vehicle is gas money.  I think even as a room mate I would tell my roommates if I were staying out late.  My spouse and I were literally waiting for her to come home and she never texted, nothing.  We went to bed  eventually and I let her know I was super unhappy with her.  I know in this situation I had a right to my feelings but she tells me I'm overreacting because I told her how rude she was.  

I wanted to go to the farmer's market for over a year, her first date with this girl is the farmers market, and this is a person who can't even stay at a busy restaurant because she has agoraphobia, but she took her to the place I still haven't gone yet.  Her answer to this is she could take me too, then proceeds to tell me how it isn't that great.  Maybe I'd like to go with someone who is also excited to go.  She also went back with her to the farmer's right after our double date

She says our time together is driving around in the mornings...  She used to make us coffee every morning wed out vibes on the tv and chill but we have no central a/c currently so we now go drive.  She got upset that because I lost/quit my job and her, my child's gf, and my spouse all split the bills now.  She was living here for nearly free, they all were I was the one supporting everyone and their money was theirs.  And she complained that $300 a month (car, rent, all of it) was breaking her.  She used to buy us coffee or redbulls but now I don't even feel comfortable with that most the time.  She has no complaints spending money on her new gf.

Idk I think I just need to vent because this mixed with the very traumatic job loss (which getting this job was after a mass layoff by my previous company that I loved) and just everything in life being twice as much financially as the year before.  It's been rough.  I can't go to my friends who have recently made themselves scarce.  My mom will find a way to criticize me from things that have nothing to do with anything, and my spouse is with her too and they have their own relationship (that's the only way these things work, their relationship is theirs, ours is ours). 

Ultimately she is happier than she has ever been and I'm happy for her.  I just wish I didn't feel like whatever I feel in the process.  I've talked about breaking up and just being close friends, she doesn't want that either.  I really don't know how to feel and what to do.",2,1753735346.0,nonmonogamy,3,0.75,False

The best cup holders utilize strong,adjustable clamps that can accommodate various desk thicknesses,ensuring a stable and wobble-free connection.

The width of the clamp arm should also be considered, based on the edge dimensions of your desk.

**Holder Design:** The Holder's design plays a crucial role in accommodating different cup sizes and shapes. A well-designed holder will feature an adjustable diameter or flexible grips to securely hold everything from narrow water bottles to wide mugs.

To preface: I just got these today and the house recommends resting these for a few days, and I think the heat where I live is definitely affecting a couple of them so I will revisit in a couple weeks. Overall though i‚Äôm incredibly impressed with these, probably my favorite indie perfumery i‚Äôve tried! 

LycanthropeüçÖüê∫ - Spicy tomato leaf, dark honey, and oakmoss, with hints of peach, lychee, ivy, vanilla, and tomatoes fresh from the vine

Okay remember how I said a couple of these might have to be rested for a while? Yeah I definitely think the heat did something to their honey note because ALL i am getting from this is an incredibly syrupy, cloying, overpowering honey odor, like smelling a bottle of honey syrup at a coffee shop on a hundred degree day, I actually had to throw away the tester card because I didn‚Äôt want it anywhere near me. People seem to love this one though so I‚Äôll be revisiting in a few weeks! Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è

Vasilia üçÄüçØ(free sample) - Clover honey, neroli, rich tonka, chamomile, dry hay, a flower crown of marigolds & sunflowers

Alright again with the honey, this one is slightly less offensive but basically the same. Hopefully the rest of the notes emerge eventually because it sounds beautiful! Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è

One White Crow üåøü™ª- A soft  foug√®re with creamy white tea, airy vanilla, violets, honeysuckle, and a touch of lavender over a bed of moss and ivy

Getting into the fragrances I believe were unaffected by transport, this one is very nice but I wish I was getting more tea and less vanilla/lavendar combo because those notes take it into more mature/baby powder territory. However, I am detecting a delicate greenness and soapy cleanliness in the background which gives me hope that it will settle into something more delicate. As it stands, it reminds me of something that an English aristocrat might‚Äôve worn, very enjoyable! Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Olympias üç∑‚öúÔ∏è- Labdanum, creamy heliotrope, opium, laurel leaves, golden vanilla, sandalwood, pear, a drop of red wine

This one is different than I thought it would be, it‚Äôs very warm and spicy off the bat and almost reminds me of those holiday simmer pot kits they would sell at department stores when I was a kid. However, eventually some uplifting sweetness from the pear and some dark jammy fruitiness from the wine start to unfold, creating a fragrance that is simultaneously invigorating and mysterious. More of a cold weather scent I would say, but i really liked this! Need to try a full wear on skin for sure. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.5

Olwyn üëë- Magnolias, plush white lilies, night-blooming jasmine, and gardenias over rich, buttery vanilla, myrrh, benzoin, and a hint of orange blossom

Okay these next two are loves of mine, and WOW. If you met Aphrodite in person, she would smell like this. It‚Äôs a heady, sophisticated, absolutely HORNY white floral blend that is so perfectly balanced and not cloying at all. You can smell the realistic flower petals and nectar in the opening, and it opens up more the longer you wear it. I was initially worried about the vanilla/myrrh/benzoin combo because i‚Äôm not a fan of sweet gourmands, but this isn‚Äôt that at all. It just makes the white florals even more, more of everything delightful that they already are, deeper and richer and sexier and smokier. Will be upgrading to a roller-ball for SURE. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.5

Lymphae üåßÔ∏èüíß- Fresh musk, cool vanilla, a swift-running stream, Italian lilac, orange blossom, damp earth, and the ozone of spring thunderstorms

This is the juiciest, most effervescent fragrance i‚Äôve ever experienced. Almost like a playful, warm-weather suited younger sister to Olwyn, it opens up incredibly bright and bubbly and aquatic, like it actually smells wet somehow. The florals are so beautiful and light and soapy, and combine wonderfully with the vanilla. This is also easily the most realistic petrichor fragrance i‚Äôve ever smelled in my life, the wet earth is perfectly spalike and calming and not at all ‚Äúdirty‚Äù.

1mbrf35,https://i.redd.it/l7g3cmznboff1.jpeg,My Financial Journey Budgeting in 2025,"**The Financial Education I Never Got in School**

One thing I noticed throughout school was that I was never taught how to grow wealth. As someone who loves learning, I spent countless evenings reading financial books, trying to find approaches that actually resonated with me.

**My 10+ Year Manual Tracking System**

I've been manually tracking every expense in a spreadsheet (started with Excel) since my teenage years. The habit that's stuck with me most is entering each expense by hand instead of relying on apps or automatic categorization. Yes, we could easily automate this in today's world, but that defeats the purpose.

When we spend money instantly by tapping our phones, manual expense tracking forces you to feel each purchase - it's like spending physical cash. Having to type ""‚Ç¨4.50 - Coffee"" three times in one week makes you question whether that expense is actually worth it.

This simple habit has led to countless ""unsubscribe"" moments and helped me eliminate wasteful spending before it becomes a pattern. The awareness alone has been a game-changer for building consistent saving habits.

**My thoughts**

After learning so much from FIRE communities over the years, I wanted to share this approach for anyone looking to get more intentional with their spending and savings.

I'm definitely not a financial expert - far from it. I've just found a method that works well for me and stuck with it consistently. If this resonates with you, I'll find time over the next few weeks to write more about how I've navigated my financial journey as an adult.

This post won't include a ton of detail, but just a high level overview of timing.\**

**Hiya recruits!**  
  
With a new year of law school just around the corner and a fresh wave of incoming 1Ls joining the sub, I thought it‚Äôd be helpful to share this updated, no-BS breakdown of the 1L timeline‚Äîespecially for those of you aiming for **BigLaw**.

This year‚Äôs cycle was wild. Firms opened 1L apps earlier than ever and some filled positions in record. So if you're trying to land a BigLaw job, my hope is that you can consider this your **master calendar + early-warning system.**

This post is written for people who, like me, had *no clue* how timelines worked going in. I‚Äôve also got a **longer monthly guide with details for all of this, including with templates, deadlines, and trackers** if you want to go deeper‚Äîjust DM and I‚Äôll send it over.

Remember, there are a ton of guides, referenced here and generally, pinned to the sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1j1tesh/new_to_rblr_and_recruiting_read_this_megathread/), and you can learn more from the community by asking questions here or on the [Discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1kh074k/the_rbiglawrecruiting_discord_is_now_live/).

And finally‚Äî**you don‚Äôt have to do everything.** Not everyone should. You know yourself best. But if you‚Äôre someone who likes to prep early and reduce stress later, I hope this helps.

So let's get to it.

# üîÅ TL;DR First: Big Picture Changes in Early Hiring, Including in Pre-OCI

‚úÖ **1L General Summer Associate and Diversity Apps:**

* Some opened **as early as October 1 last cycle** (Davis Polk, Quinn, Reed Smith, Wilson Sonsini, King & Spalding, etc.).
* Many did **screener and callback interviews before grades** (and had students update them once grades came out, so results were coming out as early as December/early January) and some even made **offers outright** (just conditional on grades).
* **Judicial + Federal Government** roles (like DOJ, SEC, Fed Reserve) opened as early as **September/October** and some even closed by **late November**.

‚úÖ **2L OCI Timeline Shift:**

* Dozens of firms now open **direct 2L apps as early as March‚ÄìMay**, especially in the super active and large markets like NY. 
* Many schools moved their OCI or Early Interview Programs (EIP/EIW) to be earlier, like June or even some in May, *but* many didn't. Some students were left holding the bag when exceptionally few firms showed up to OCI in July (i.e. Fordham only had some 30 firms show up to their OCI and many of them were essentially entirely full). 
   * **So, personally, I recommend NOT depending solely on your career services for help.** That isn't to say don't use them. They can be incredibly helpful. But as they say, trust but verify. Apply early, and do research yourself, and don't wait for your school to tell you when you need to do things. They've often missed the boat for many students (just look back at this sub and you'll see countless posts and comments on frustrating career services experiences; in fact, there is an entire [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1jker71/the_bad_advice_from_career_services_megathread/) based entirely on bad advice career services gave students). 
   * So do your own research, trust your gut, and take everyone's advice (including ours) with a grain of salt. 

Now let‚Äôs walk through 1L year, step-by-step.

# üìÜ The 1L BigLaw Timeline

# üìö July (Before School Starts)

* ‚úÖ Read the [0L prep guide](https://chatgpt.com/c/687fa675-fabc-8013-b5a1-e32d6ba76035#) if you haven't.
* ‚úÖ If you really want to get ahead: make a draft of your resume and cover letter now. It won't be changing significantly by the time you apply to 1L jobs, and this is one less thing to worry about when school is in full swing. 
   * If you need templates for these, feel free to DM. 

# üìö August (Orientation + Week 1-2 of Class)

* ‚úÖ **Outlines**: Collect past outlines for each class (you'll be able to find one for every class except legal writing, which won't have one).
   * Best places to find these are from upper classmen and clubs! Just ask for their outline banks. 
* ‚úÖ **Reading**: Read with exams in mind. 
   * Personally, I thought *A Guide to Law School Exams* by Alex Schimel was the most helpful of the bunch. 
* ‚úÖ **Know Your Goal**: If BigLaw is your target, read up on practice areas and markets.
   * If you don't know what you want to do generally, see this post: [A list of popular legal jobs for the 1L's going to law school but who don't know what they want to do (Updated Repost)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1m4qy1s/a_list_of_popular_legal_jobs_for_the_1ls_going_to/)
   * GULC has a nice [list](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Cardinal-Search-Partners-NY-Practice-Area-Guide-2022-.pdf) of practice areas and the firms that have practices in them, with short descriptions, so that should help you have a quick reference point on anything you might want to explore further. 

# üìö September

* üîπ **Academics First**: Grades are still king on whether landing a big law job is easy or hard. So stay focused.
* üîπ **Professor Relationships**: Go to office hours early and often. You‚Äôll need references soon when you start applications.
* üîπ **Career Launchpad**\- if you haven't already:
   * Start your **legal resume**.
   * Build a **cover letter template**.
   * Go to some career panels, firm reception, and have a few networking conversations. (Some firms track attendance at these events to see who is actually interested and spent time getting to know them, so attending is an excellent way to be able to name drop events/people in your cover letters.)
   * Again, DM if you want resume/cover letter templates‚Äîhappy to share.
* üîπ **Talk to people**:
   * Start talking to 2Ls about what they did their 1L summer. It doesn't even need to be about anything specific--it can just help just to hear about how people approached their process. 

# üìö October

* ‚úÖ **Apply Early**:
   * **Some BigLaw apps open this month** \- if you need a list of all the firm direct application links and their opening deadlines, feel free to DM. 
   * Some federal internships (e.g., SEC, USAO) and even some state/local internships (i.e., State AG's, some DA's offices like DANY) also begin opening now, and some close as early as November or December, so submit your app ASAP once you see any of these open. 
* ‚úÖ **Start Applying**: Have your materials for applications ready.
   * Everything you'll need will include:
      * Resume: A quick ""what NOT to do"" post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fm7dn9/what_not_to_do_on_your_resume_for_big_law_jobs_a/). 
      * Cover letter: A quick mini-break down/tip can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1ko6akj/a_quick_cover_letter_strategy_to_help_boost_your/).
      * Writing sample (you will want to use your first memo in legal writing in the vast majority of cases) and cover page
      * Reference list (DM if you need a template)
      * If applicable, Diversity/Additional Personal statement if you're applying to a diversity position (assuming they still exist in a few months--though many firms are just renaming them as something like ""community"" or ""merit"" or whatever applications, they are substantively the same). You can reuse your diversity statement/essay when applying to law school if you like. More details on what a Diversity Summer is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fc2kbc/what_is_a_1l_diversity_summer_associate_job_a_1ls/) and how to write a diversity statement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fyfaqd/how_to_write_a_diversity_statement_for_big_law/).
* ‚úÖ **Outlines & Exam Prep**: 
   * Create an outlining plan & set deadlines (here's a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1f83l7e/how_to_outline_a_guide_for_1ls/) if you need one on this). 
* ‚úÖ **Memo Season**: Go to office hours. Understand your professor‚Äôs quirks. 
   * Legal writing can be SUPER professor specific, so the more time you can get understanding what your specific professor wants to see, the better. 

# üìö November (There's a November timeline specific post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1gge1mw/the_1l_november_game_plan_what_to_prioritize_and/))

* ‚úÖ **Game On**:
   * This mostly echos Oct. but now things will start to pick up for the next few months. 
      * Apply to **1L BigLaw diversity and 1L general programs** ‚Äî some open **early Nov**. Again, if you need a list as opposed to trying to gather which firms are open when yourself, feel free to DM
      * Apply to **Gov‚Äôt & Judicial Internships**‚Äîmany close in **late Nov/early Dec**. A bit more detail on the judicial internship process is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1h2tnlh/hey_1ls_time_to_send_out_those_judicial/). 
* ‚úÖ **Practice Exams**: Begin weekly practice if possible.
   * Not everyone practices the same way, but just think about your approach to practice exams. A guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1f8wlma/a_1ls_guide_to_practice_exams/). 
* ‚úÖ **Memo Due?** Turn it in (don't leave it until the last minute--your future self will thank you). Then back to finals prep.

# üìö December

* ‚úÖ **Exams First**: Study smarter. 
   * Practice exams are generally more important than rereading material. Go to office hours. It doesn't matter what you actually do as long as you do what works for you. 
* ‚úÖ **Keep Applying**: Many more 1L apps (BigLaw and public interest) open now.
   * **KEY INFORMATION:** Apply now EVEN IF you think you can't/won't get it. We saw a ton of firms just roll applicants right into early callbacks for 2L applications if they didn't quite make the cut for 1L because of grades/school/whatever, so think of these applications as playing the long game--even if 1L summer associate gigs might not work out for you. 
* ‚úÖ **Rest After Finals**: 
   * If you already have your job lined up, AMAZING. In that case, winter break is for recovery‚Ä¶ and regrouping and getting ready for 2L applications next semester.
   * If you don't, that's also okay and totally normal. A ton of folks don't get their jobs until Jan, Feb, or later. You just ideally don't want to be job hunting for your 1L summer in the spring when you'll ALSO be hunting for your 2L summer. So the earlier you can knock it out, the better. 
   * Note, it doesn't actually really matter what you do for your 1L summer as long as it's something legal. Check out these two posts if you need:
      * [Where Do I Find 1L Summer Jobs? An Aggregated Guide For 1L‚Äôs](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1h6k14b/where_do_i_find_1l_summer_jobs_an_aggregated/)

* ‚úÖ **Post-Finals Plan**:
   * Update your resume and applications.
   * Update your resume/applications with grades once you get them back. 

# üìö January

* ‚úÖ **Submit Updated Apps**: Many firms and other applications will ask for grades. Send them once you have them.
* ‚úÖ **Start Interviewing**: Assuming you don't already have something locked down, you might start to see a lot of interviews popping up in Jan. Many folks will even get their 1L big law offers/answers in early Jan (with many getting results through Jan-March; see screenshot for examples of students in the database from this 1L cycle).

* ‚úÖ **Reflect**: What worked? What didn‚Äôt? Now is an excellent time to figure out what is and isn't working for you. Adjust for Spring.
   * If you need a callback/screener interview prep document with basically every question a firm could ask you and recommended answers, I also have one I'm happy to share, just DM. 
* ‚úÖ **SOME BIG LAW FIRMS OPEN APPS THIS MONTH FOR 2L APPLICATIONS**
   * Yes, I know, it's actually nuts. But see below for some of the firms that opened early last year. 

https://preview.redd.it/41r8iyzh7off1.png?width=2892&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b68a81d6cbb9130d3760f8474bbcc1d04629edd

# üìö February

* ‚úÖ **Interviewing May Continue**: Some screeners and callbacks may still be going out but most offers will be out and wrapping up this month and March. 
   * Also, remember, part of why we want to apply to 1L positions is that you might get rolled right into early interviews for 2L positions (which is something we saw happen last year; see below for some of the early timelines for offers we saw, with some offers for 2L coming in as early as Feb and March)

https://preview.redd.it/wxxohq9ocoff1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6e54212b7565817f6d25978c063f2a2e73d3b9c

* ‚úÖ **Networking 2.0**: Reconnect with attorneys you met earlier. Cold email new ones.
   * Remember that networking is a MUSCLE. It is very difficult to get someone you only talked to once to advocate for you, but if you have multiple touchpoints with them, it's a lot easier. 
* ‚úÖ **Journal Info Sessions**: Schools around now start to have a few talks about how journals work. You won't actually participate in the write on competition until after Spring exams, but it's good to just learn if it‚Äôs worth it for your goals.

# üìö March

* ‚úÖ **2L Recruiting Start in Earnest**:
   * Yes, it is ridiculously early now. I hear you. Firms like Fenwick, K&S, Weil, and more opened direct 2L summer apps this month last year and we expect even more to follow the trend this year.
   * Start applying in waves now‚Äîdo NOT wait for OCI in July (or even May/June). These two posts should help understand the process a bit. 
   * [Pre-OCI, Explained (for those of you prepping for March/April hiring!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1irueip/preoci_explained_for_those_of_you_prepping_for/)

* ‚úÖ **Spring Outlining Begins**
* ‚úÖ **Spring Break = A Real Break and a Network Break**: Take time to breathe and relax where you can, but it's also an excellent time to schedule a couple coffee chats so you're not crammed trying to network at the end of the recruiting season. 
   * It's also a great time just to do a couple practice interviews. Remember, interviewing is a muscle and you'll be doing SO many of these (honestly to the point where they all just blur together) so you'll want to make sure you have that muscle tuned up so it's super sharp. 

# üìö April

* ‚úÖ **Lock in Your 1L Summer Job:** Really, whatever it is, just pick so you can put something on your resume for 2L applications. 
* ‚úÖ **Begin OCI Prep**:
   * Your school might be one of the schools that is starting their OCI early now (around May/June). If so, you'll want to make a draft of your bid list. This post may help:

* ‚úÖ **Keep sending 2L pre-OCI direct applications:** This is a numbers game. Remember that some folks apply to literally 100+ before they get 1 offer, so don't stop swinging until you hit something. See [üì® How Many Firms Should You Apply to? Let‚Äôs Talk Strategy (Spoiler: A Lot)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1klnz3x/how_many_firms_should_you_apply_to_lets_talk/).

# üìö June

* ‚úÖ **(Most) School OCI or Early Interview Programs (EIW/EIP, sometimes also with ""resume drops"") Starts**:
   * Early Interview Programs often happen **before OCI**. Think of it like a super mini-OCI, or where you submit your materials and firms get to pick the students they want to interview. 
* ‚úÖ **Keep sending 2L pre-OCI direct applications**

# July

* ‚úÖ **Keep sending 2L pre-OCI direct applications**
* ‚úÖ **Traditional OCI's begin:** Some schools still keep OCI until this late in the process. If so, this is your last major chance at big law summers; after this, it all slows down significantly and we start to enter the post-OCI phase (which can be an extremely uphill battle).

# üß† Final Thoughts

You *don‚Äôt* need to follow this to the letter. But you *should* be aware that BigLaw is moving earlier and faster every year.

You're failing because you're disciplined toward the wrong things.,"You show up religiously to scroll social media. You never miss a Netflix episode. You're consistent with your excuses, punctual with your procrastination, reliable with your avoidance patterns.

The same mental machinery that could build your dream life is currently maintaining your nightmare. The same focus that could transform your body is memorizing TikTok trends. The same consistency that could create wealth is creating debt through mindless spending.

Discipline isn't something you lack. Discipline is something you've misallocated. You've trained yourself to be excellent at things that make your life worse. You've become a master of habits that keep you trapped.

Every day you strengthen neural pathways that lead nowhere. Every time you choose immediate comfort over delayed gratification, you're practicing the skill of self-sabotage. Every time you avoid difficult work, you're getting better at avoiding difficult work.

Your brain doesn't distinguish between good habits and bad habits. It just reinforces whatever you practice most consistently. Right now you're practicing mediocrity with the same dedication that could create excellence.

The person who can't stick to a workout routine somehow never misses their morning coffee. The person who can't save money somehow never forgets to pay for streaming services. The person who can't focus on important work somehow binges entire seasons without losing attention.

Next month, I am heading from DC to St. Louis, with the obvious stop in Chicago. I have booked this to where I have a long stopover in Chicago (arrive 10 am on a Thursday, leave at 7 am on Friday). My plan, as it stands now is to avoid getting a hotel (pretty early train, so I wouldn‚Äôt be getting a whole lot of sleep) and doing the following:

1. Depart DC on Cardinal 51 in Coach (have ridden coach many times and usually do fine with it - I sleep well in train seats)
2. Arrive Chicago on Cardinal 51 (approx. 10 am - I know there is a decent chance it delays)
3. Get some food in town and work for a while from the station or locally
4. Store bags at station
5. Meet up with some friends for dinner
6. Go listen to blues music at one of the local joints (right now leaning towards Rosa‚Äôs Lounge, which should go until about 2 am)
7. Catch a 24-hour place for coffee and all-night food 
8. Return to station at 5 am to get bags
9. Catch Missouri River Runner 301 (I have a business class seat) at 7 am for St. Louis

My question is am I being crazy thinking I can kill enough time to avoid getting a cheap hotel room? I really don‚Äôt want to fork over the money for one, since I really won‚Äôt be in it long and I can use the station to store bags. Do you guys think this schedule would work? Am I overthinking this?

1mbr9ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1mbr9ea/hemorrhoid_crisis/,Hemorrhoid Crisis,"I wanted to document my experience in hopes that it helps others.

*Background*

Healthy 40M.  I‚Äôve had hemorrhoids since college.  The body is incredibly resilient, but it is also a delicate system.  I think my hemmorrhoids were a result of genetic predisposition and lifestyle.  K-12 Sitting in a hard chair for 7 hours a day.  Working in a computer repair shop desk job through high school.  Harsh diet and lifestyle at college.  Continuing to work a desk job for the next 20 years and spending too much time sitting.  I had several internal and external hemmorrhoids over the years and was generally able to manage them with conservative treatment.  There were flareups at times and some ups and downs.  Over the years, I would have flare-ups and at times would seek medical help, in the end always opting for conservative treatment and getting the situation under control.  In general I try to avoid Drs, medicine, etc.  More recently they had become larger and one was prone to bleed (often heavily) during\\after bowel movements.  Outside of flare-ups they weren‚Äôt particularly painful for the most part.  I was always able to easily push any protrusion of internal hems back inside (manually reduce).  They would at times bleed after \\ during heavy exertion (ie. playing hockey, or clearing up downed trees with chainsaw).  So, I had instances where I would bleed through underwear \\ pants without even realizing it was happening.  

*Hemorrhoid Crisis*

I had a flare up begin shortly before a 2 week family vacation overseas.  The large hemorrhoid prone to bleed got larger and stopped bleeding.  I was still able to manually reduce it, but it was very painful and it sometimes took up to 15-20 minutes in the shower to reduce the hems.  At one point while reducing the hems in the shower I experience a release of discharge that smelled fishy.  I think this was an indication that I was dealing with an infection.  I used hydrocortisone cream and tried to eat as clean as possible to make it through the trip.  It was painful at times and I struggled sitting but I managed to soldier through and enjoy the vacation.

Once I returned home, I began a 7 day doxycycline cycle to clear any infection, I was drinking a lot of water and eating clean and small portions but my symptoms did not improve.  I also started the process of trying to consult with DRs.  Most places had a several month wait to see a GI Dr.  General Practitioner Dr. was unhelpful.  I called around daily to try and find an appointment with a specialist (looking\\hoping  for cancellations) and eventually got one with a GI Dr. within a week and a half.  

At this point, normal healthy BMs were extremely painful.  After any bowel movement, (and I would typically go once or twice a day with normal stools). I would have to shower, reduce BMS (coconut oil helped at this point). And then I would need to lay down from the pain for an hour and ice the area.  The pain at this time was 10/10 and cause me at times to just lay there crying unable to get comfortable.    As I was going through this, I kept telling myself that if I can‚Äôt reduce these hems, its time to go the hospital.  I was close to going on a couple occasions.  It got to a point where I was working on my laptop in bed and I could only do short exertions around the house before needing to lay down.  

The evening before my GI dr. appt, I had a BM, was unable to reduce the hemorrhoids at all and decided to go to the hospital.  The Dr. who looked at me consulted with a colorectal surgeon who was not onsite.  They said that just looking at my condition, it appeared I needed surgery, but there was no one currently at the hospital to do it.  They said my condition was not currently life threatening and suggested that I go home, call the GI surgeons office the following morning and try to get an urgent appointment.  They said if my condition worsened at all to come back to the ER during the day when there was more likely to be a surgeon that could help.  They provided 4% lidocaine cream which provided a small amount of relief.  They also pointed out that at this stage, it was no longer beneficial to try and reduce hems.  Essentially leave them out and coat with a large amount of lidocaine and hydrocortisone.  I went home, unable to sleep with the pain and sat in a sitz bath most of the night.  

I proceeded to the previously scheduled GI dr appt. the following morning. They recognized the urgency of my situation, made a few phone calls and found a local surgeon that was able to see me the same afternoon.  

At this point, the pain was pretty steadily an 8 to 10 / 10.  I was miserable, irritable, and couldn‚Äôt think straight.  I honestly wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make it to the ‚Äúnext thing‚Äù.  I was taking max doses of advil and Tylenol at interval.  I also have a fairly high pain tolerance.  I‚Äôve played competitive hockey for 30 years- broken bones, torn ligaments.  Also dealing with hemmorhoids over the years, I had previously had an anal fissure.  The pain that I was currently in, was far beyond anything I had experienced previously.

I saw the surgeon later that day and while evaluating me he quickly declared-  This is a hemorrhoid crisis.  He explained that given the size and nature of the hems, lancing them was not an option.  He pointed out that as always- the best thing to do is to treat them conservatively, but that given my situation surgery seemed like a beneficial course of action.  He pointed out that it would be most ideal to at least wait until they progressed past the acute phase (allow extreme swelling to subside) to do surgery to minimize the chances of future complications, but that doing so could take additional weeks.  By this point it had been over a month since the flare up had started and I felt that it was unlikely that they would significantly reduce at this point.  He also said that he felt confident that he could successfully perform the surgery with minimal risk of future complications as is.  There was an opening in the O.R. the following evening and I scheduled surgery.

He suggested that I sitz bath with Epsom salts with water as hot as I can tolerate as much as possible over the next 24 hours and coat the area with lido \\ hydro cortisone anytime not in the tub.  I asked what method would be utilized for removal (open, closed, etc).  He said that he would determine that at the time of surgery for each hemorrhoid based on what should lead to the best outcome.

I had to go to the hospital the following morning for pre surgical lab work and EKG, which was a brutal 40 min car ride.  I went back home and rested \\ got in the tub until leaving for surgery.  In the 24 hours I probably spent 6 or 7 hours in sitz bath.  By the time I went to the hospital (Weds afternoon) I was feeling the first bit of relief since Monday evening pre-BM- pain was down to a 5-6 instead of 8-10 while outside of the tub and I was able to sit upright in the hospital bed for 20 minutes while waiting for surgery (instead of lying on my side). I think that if I kept sitz bathing for 6 hours a day, I could have potentially waited surgery out a bit longer, but who knows.  At this point I had suffered enough and was ready to move forward.

*Surgery Prep*

Obviously I didn‚Äôt have a ton of time to prepare for surgery.  Because of my condition, I had already been eating low calorie, bland diet.  This is\\was beneficial because anything that is in your system is going to have to pass the wounds.  Avoid eating ANY seeds, spicy food, processed food, etc.  for several days before surgery.

Gather supplies you are going to need for the next week.  Gauze pads, fiber supplements (colace), milk of magnesia, Tylenol, ibuprofen, full fridge \\ pantry of bland healthy food.  Having books to read or things to do while laying around the house.

Caretaker- This surgery is no joke. You are going to be on bedrest for the first 3 days.  My wife and I agree, the closest parallel is recovering from childbirth.  In some ways its more challenging because your wounds are where you poop.  I am\\was extremely fortunate that my wife is a great caretaker.  Cooking meals, ensuring I take correct medicine at the proper intervals, making sure I have everything I need.  I cant imagine being able to do this recovery solo.  If you don‚Äôt have a good caretaker\\helper you will need to have a good system to keep track of everything.

Diapers- My wife had adult diapers leftover from childbirth and they happened to fit me, these came in handy because I could put them on easily and they kept the gauze in place without having to mess with tape or anything.  I have been fortunate that I haven‚Äôt had any accidents, but it could definitely happen.

Doggy pads for humans- these were helpful to have down on the bathroom floor and to sleep on just in case.

*Day 0*

I awoke from surgery and Doc said that the surgery was successful and there was no complications.  He removed 4 large grade 4 circumferential hems, through 4 columns.  3 internal, 1 external.  I had both open wounds and stitches that would dissolve on their own.  A local anesthetic (exparel) was utilized under general anesthesia.  This would keep the area numb for the next 72 hours.  Because of the powerful local anesthetic, I was told I absolutely could not use any local anesthetic creams for at least 96 hours.  And since I had open wounds, I should not sitz bath with Epsom salts or apply Hydrocortisone.  He said that I would very much need the Oxycodone when the Exparel wears off.  The nurse asked what my pain level was when I woke up and I felt 4 to 5.  I was having some tremors but overall felt OK.  I was given a single Oxy 5mg which helped bring the pain down to a 2.  I went home feeling overall significantly better than pre-surgery.  I started taking 600MG advil OR 1000 mg acetaminphin every 3 hours.  I woke every 3 hours in some discomfort so I would change gauze and take next dose of med.  At this point, I don‚Äôt feel the need to take oxy.

*Day 1*

Overall feeling not too bad.  At 11AM I feel increased pain and have my first BM.  I passed the plug that was holding a lot in.  This was an intense and large BM.  A lot of blood, discharge and poop.  It was quite painful (8/10), but not really worse that what I hadn‚Äôt been through recently.  Basically felt like I cleared everything in my system.  Also, a big relief knowing that I am not constipated.  The reason this BM was not much worse is the local anesthetic at work.  I sitz bath for 30 mins after and then get back to bed rest.  I had a couple smaller BMs later in the day, a lot of blood, but pain isn‚Äôt bad (4 / 10).

*Day 2*

I can really only sleep for 3 hour intervals (til I need my next pain med set).  I also wake up to go to the bathroom.  I am noticing that anytime that I have a little extra pain down there usually means theres some stool ready to come out and it will shortly after I stand up.  So I typically walk right to the bathroom whenever I get up.  I probably have 5 BMS the second day, some blood, but not much.  Mostly smaller volume dust-like stools.

*Day 3*

Local anesthetic seems mostly worn off, so I am having a bit more pain with BMs.  I have 2 smaller BMs.  Stool is somewhat starting to form more than the prior day- soft pebbles.  I am realizing that I am taking laxative dose assuming 5 Oxys per day and to this point I have only taken 2 oxys total.  I wonder if I would be better off taking a smaller dose of laxative, but Dr. said that it is much better to have looser stools than harder stools, So I am just going to keep it where it is for now.  Stools aren‚Äôt intolerably painful, are done in a min or two and I don‚Äôt have to push at all.  Only complaint is that I am going 3 to 5 times per 24 hours.  After each BM, I dab clean with wet Gauze and then take a sitz bath for at least 20 mins.  After that, I will often ice pack the area for 10 mins.  At Night I wake as usual around 3 hours after falling asleep.  I figure that I am going to go to the bathroom when I get up, so I have my wife bring me an oxy and then lay there for 30 mins for it to kick in.   This makes the pain during bm A 2-3 instead of a 6-7.

*Day 4*

Have two morning BMs.  Pretty good volume with each, pain is 4/10.  Stool is soft 1/2‚Äù small pieces.  Pretty amazed that there is no blood in stool \\ BM and also very little if any blood on the gauze when cleaning up.  I do have a small amount of clear \\ red \\ brown discharge on the gauze when I change it every few hours, but overall it seems that healing is well under way.  I‚Äôd say my biggest issue right now is my bottom spasming during the BMs causing them to not fully evacuate.  I wonder if I sat on the toilet longer more would come out, but I am keeping it to 3 mins or less right now.  Obviously the spasms also causes a bit of pain \\ is a result of the pain.  The sitz bath counteracts this and relaxes everything so I will often stay in up to 45 minutes.  I have found it helpful after BM to gently activate the nearby muscles which seems to help further calm spasms.  After I stand up- going into a quarter squat position- activating quads, hamstring, glutes and core.  In the tub, doing a few partial bridges- gently raising bottom from water and tightening glutes.

*Day 5*

Again, I only sleep from 8-1130 and then 2-545AM.  I mostly feel like this is enough sleep given that I am not exerting much during the days.  Just walking around a bit and standing for a couple hours at this point.  I am working mostly from my labtop in bed and standing at my desk the rest of the time.  I feel like at this point, I just need to stick with the regiment that I am on and I will be in really good shape in a couple weeks.  I am going to ramp up walking and other light activitiy, but still feel like I need to give this time to heal.  It hurts to cough and I have some random sharp pains \\ spasms periodically, but I think and hope that is normal and just part of the healing process.  This afternoon I have felt significantly better.  Walking is still a little awkward, but there is zero to minimal pain.  I took one 5mg oxy instead of Tylenol dose at 8AM this morning prior to BM but otherwise and just alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen. I‚Äôve walked around the house a bunch, done several chores and sliced and roasted potatoes that the kids and I grew this season and harvested last week.  I feel sharp and present.

*Diet*

The importance of this can not be overstated.  You need to be eating healthy, high quality, ideally home cooked foods in smaller than normal quantities and supplement with fiber \\ laxatives to ensure that you don‚Äôt get constipated.  Here is what has worked for me- crackers, grapes, blueberries, bananas, apples, avocado toast on sourdough bread, rice with avocado bbq sauce and a small amount of crockpot cooked chicken.  I would estimate I‚Äôve been eating 1600 or so calories a day.  Intentionally consuming smaller quantities to make digestion easier.  I have not consumed any processed food, fried food, junk, candy, coffee, alcohol, etc.

As previously mentioned, my diet since college has been fairly healthy.  Although at times I have had a tendency to indulge in less than ideal food and overeat.  I had times in the past where I had bouts of diarrhea \\ upset stomach that lasted weeks or months.  Went to GI, had colonoscopy and never found anything conclusive.  I added an occaisional serving of raw milk yogurt to my diet years ago and since doing so my overall digestive system has functioned with very few issues (other than the hemorrhoids).  

*Surgeon \\ Hospital*

I was fortunate\\lucky to go to a hospital in the area with a great reputation.  The surgeon I saw gets all 5 star reviews.  I really have to give the surgeon a ton of credit here.  I was in bad shape- this was a significant procedure.  And 5 days out I am in miraculous condition.  The care at the hospital was great- amazing staff.  Bottom line- its worth going to the best.

*Looking ahead*

I intend on continuing the current routine fairly strictly for at least another couple weeks.  Beyond that, I plan to continue to maintain a healthier than previous diet \\ lifestyle.  I think it makes sense to continue to supplement fiber, eat less than I was before and minimize unhealthy choices.  I also plan to further investigate \\ pursue physical therapy that may help avoid recurrence.  Things like pelvic floor training \\ kegels.

*Final Thoughts*

I didn‚Äôt realize how significantly my hemorrhoids were impacting my quality of life.  It was a situation that very slowly got worse and worse over time.  I was definitely affected \\ suffering way more than I realized \\ accepted.  Its only 5 days out from surgery and I feel very confident that I will be fully healed and in a significantly better place mentally and physically than I was before.  I already am much better than I was in the days leading up to surgery.  I would encourage anyone who is dealing with grade 2 or grade 3 hemorrhoids to seek professional medical treatment if unable to control them with conservative treatments \\ lifestyle changes.  There are a lot of less invasive options before you get to where I ended up.  In hindsight, I probably should have gotten surgery years ago.

Writing this up has been therapeutic and given me something to do during the recovery, my hope is that someone finds it helpful.  Will try to post an update in a few weeks.

I recently wrote a book on my interpretation of several maps about the  Lost Dutchman Mine. I pinpointed a location and went there. I took photos, matched it to all the clues and self published a book. I printed out about 100 copies to sell and offer them to local LDM museums to sell as well. I dropped off one book for the curator of the museum to review and see if they wanted to put it on their shelf. I get a call the next day from some guy who ""happened to be behind the counter"" when he saw my book with a sticky note on it with my phone number. He was curious and flipped through the pages and flipped out. I guess I pinpointed the location that his supposedly psychic grandfather had said and he and his family were looking for over 50 years (combined). I guess they didn't know how to read the maps and were off a little. Anyways... he wanted me to unpublish the book because it will cause him great distress. I said no, but he wanted to discuss it. I figured ""sure, I'd like to discuss my book with you"" I was sort of thrilled to have someone's opinion of my book and it was somewhat validating that we agreed on the location. He wanted to meet in the desert, near the Superstition Mountains.. I said no. We agreed at a coffee shop. My wife said I was being stupid and she is usually right about those things, but I went anyways. I just figured we would talk about it and find out where he family went wrong on their search. I was wrong on that. He offered me $25k to unpublish my book. He said he has a map from his grandfather where he circled some locations near by where he suspects to be millions in gold. I then just realized that I met one of the crazies that lurk in the Superstition Mountains. I told him that I will not unpublish, but I'd be happy to help him out get to his spots if he wants. He said no and got angry. I then promptly left and said do not contact me anymore. He then blew my phone number up with horrible messages so I blocked him. Then he went to facebook and did the same. I blocked him on there. He then found out my wife's facebook address and started attacking her. I had her respond not to contact her anymore. I then unblocked my phone and sent him a message saying that I will pursue legal remedies if he continues and I will reach out to the museum to complain that someone was able to get that information about me from them. I then blocked his number. So, that's the story. Can I pursue a restraining order on him in Arizona? Did he need to threaten me to do so? What are the chances of getting one? I was told that  since he didn't actually threaten me, it may not get rewarded.",11,1753733974.0,legaladvice,2,1.0,False

1mbr3ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingout/comments/1mbr3ng/avoid_safe_ship_moving_and_cita_van_lines/,AVOID SAFE SHIP MOVING and CITA VAN LINES - TERRIBLE COMPANIES,"Safe Ship Moving EMS (SSM) and CITA VAN LINES should be avoided if at all possible.  They are liars and overcharge for incompetence and poor service in all respects. The reasons are as follows:

1. The original quote to pack our household goods (HHG) and ship them to our new home in Sun City, Arizona was developed with an extremely detailed phone call quote on May 9, 2025. This quote was for a total of $14,402.47 by Michael Rodrigues of SSM and **claimed to be very accurate** given the detailed discussion.
2. I sent a detailed email to SSM describing all the household goods and offered to send photos if it would help SSM confirm any uncertainty in their quote. **They did not reply.**
3. Michael Rodrigues made many specific commitments about what we were to expect from SSM. These commitments included that SSM would:
   1. Coordinate all aspects of the move.[ **NOT DONE**]()
   2. Use a very professional and high quality moving company to pack and ship our HHG. They said that CITA Van Lines was an excellent moving and trucking company and that SSM had used them on multiple other moves and things were delivered on time and in the same condition as originally packed. **NOT DONE**
   3. Ensure all things will be carefully inventoried and the condition of items assessed and defined by the packers and agreed upon by me. **NOT DONE**
   4. Ensure that packing and loading was to be performed in one day and that day was to be June 16, 2025. I expressed concern about a one day packing and load and was told that CITA Van Lines would send an adequately sized experienced crew with packing materials and a large enough truck. **NOT DONE**
   5. Arrange for our HHG to be shipped so that a prompt delivery of June 27, 2025 or shortly afterwards would be met. It was understood that the total transportation time was to be between 5 and 14 business days. **NOT DONE**
   6. Have their customer service staff available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to provide any help needed should problems develop. This was described as always available. **NOT DONE**
4. On Friday, June 13, 2025 (packing and loading to be done the following Monday, June 16, 2025) I received a telephone call from SSM to go through a detailed virtual video phone call to ensure the original quote was still valid. This call resulted in the packing, loading, transport and unloading price being increased to $31,846.53. This **increased the original price by $17,444.06, an increase of over 220%.** We had gotten no more HHG since May 9, 2025 and in fact had reduced our property significantly.
5. I at once placed an emergency call to the customer service number as well as sent emails to Michael Rodrigues and the Customer Service email address. I got no response until 4 hours later and was informed that the Customer Service staff only had to return phone calls within 24 hours.
6. **As I had no options** given that this was Friday afternoon and we needed our things moved out of our house on the following Monday I reluctantly went forward with my move with these lying overcharging...
7. On Monday, no truck or packers showed up until noon and then only 2 people were with a box truck that would not hold all our HHG. The 2 guys and truck were **subcontractors to CITA Van Lines** and informed me that they had only been given the assignment to pack and load our HHG late prior evening while still in Nashville, Tennessee. They contacted CITA Van Lines for help packing and got 3 packers to show up to assist. These laborers were not regular employees of CITA Van Lines and had **limited to no experience packing HHG** for moving.
8. I contacted SSM about concerns and lack of experience of packers, lack of staff and that the truck was not big enough to hold all our HHG. Basically I was told that SSM was sorry but too bad. I talked to CITA Van Lines and was told basically the same thing, sorry but too bad.
9. The packers ‚Äúpacked‚Äù things for a few hours and loaded the truck. They broke a lamp while packing (which I immediately called SSM about). Given their lack of experience, packing was haphazard. **Many items had just been thrown into boxes without regard for protection or safety of our possessions.** They nearly filled the truck while there were still numerous items not yet packed and no more would fit onto the truck anyway. The plan was to drive the truck to a warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky first thing in the morning, unload the truck and then drive back to our house to get the rest of our things.
10. The next day one of the moving company guys showed up with the ‚Äúpackers‚Äù around 9:30 am..¬† The truck didn‚Äôt show up until 3:15 pm to get the rest of our HHG.
11. Haphazard packing and loading continued. Once everything was loaded, my wife and I began cleaning the house to prepare for a final inspection by the buyer, We then discovered that **numerous areas of flooring and walls were damaged** due to a total lack of concern or protection for our HHG or the house.
12. We drove out to Arizona arriving there on June 23, 2025. We called SSM about delivery of our HHG for as soon as June 27, 2025. Only at that time were we told that our HHG were still in a warehouse in Louisville and that the 5 to 14 days for transport didn‚Äôt even start until June 27, 2025. **This was contrary to all prior discussions.**
13. We expressed our displeasure to SSM and CITA Van Lines and that we thought the total fiasco of the move to that time should result in a significant credit back to us. Neither SSM nor CITA committed to doing anything other than to discuss things with their management. **No credit for any amount was offered by either company.**
14. A couple of days later we got a call saying that our HHG would be arriving on July 3, 2025 sometime in the afternoon as there was also HHG on the truck for another client. The delivery time was moved up to the morning of July 3, 2025 as the other client wasn‚Äôt even going to be available to accept their goods until July 9, 2025. It was clear that **no coordination was performed by SSM nor CITA**.
15. On July 3, 2025 another subcontracted moving truck and 4 laborers showed up. It quickly became clear that our **HHG had not been packed with care at all** (things like a cuckoo clock just thrown into a box with other hard things thrown on top and an antique violin treated with no care or protection).
16. As unloading of the truck began it became clear from the condition of the boxes that there was considerable damage to our property with **many items ruined given the lack of protection or care**. Six of seven end, coffee, craft and kitchen tables were ruined, either by legs having been knocked off, the pedestal knocked about and destroyed and a general lack of care or protection. Kitchen ware was broken/destroyed by the obvious lack of care and protection. **Additionally, things were not delivered at all,** including an antique child‚Äôs sized rolltop desk, an antique end table (we had 2 of them but one was never delivered and the other was destroyed with legs broken off). Also missing was a hand truck/moving dolly that currently is sold at Home Depot for $159.99 and had been labeled with our name.
17. There was **no attempt** by SSM or CITA Van Lines **to ensure that everything of ours was delivered.**
18. As we unpacked boxes, we continued to discover more **items ruined by the lack of care and protection. In addition, we also discovered that hardware from items that had been disassembled was nowhere to be found. Consequently more possessions were ruined.**
19. I have numerous **pictures** showing the inadequate quality of packing and poor condition in which much of our HHG arrived.

¬†

In summary, **SSM provided none of the quality services they committed to** in item 3 above, despite their promises. We were provided with a terrible moving experience by inexperienced staff and subcontractor companies instead of a high quality experienced moving company. Numerous items were ruined or lost in transit. SSM impressed us as liars and thieves and CITA Van Lines as unqualified and incapable of providing quality packing, loading, transport and delivery. Therefore I feel that the cost of the move was exorbitant and unreasonable.

I hope nobody else experiences this same terrible service from either of these companies.  They are terrible. They lied repeatedly through the entire process.  I am filing a claim but have no confidence in any fair treatment by either company.   ",2,1753733844.0,movingout,0,1.0,False
1mbr2zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/productreview/comments/1mbr2zp/ember_mug_review_is_it_actually_worth_the_price/,Ember Mug Review ‚Äì Is it actually worth the price?,"Got the Ember Mug as a gift a couple months ago, and honestly, didn‚Äôt think much of it at first. A smart mug sounded kind of extra, like something I‚Äôd use once and forget about. But after actually using it day to day, it surprised me in a few ways.

The idea behind it is simple, it keeps your coffee or tea at the exact temperature you set. You can control it with the app or just use the default settings, and once it‚Äôs set, your drink stays warm until the last sip. For someone who gets distracted and lets their coffee go cold all the time, this thing is a game-changer. No need to microwave your cup or toss out lukewarm drinks.

Battery life could be better though. Without the charging coaster, it only lasts around 1.5 hours, maybe two if you keep the temp lower. That‚Äôs fine for a quick session at your desk, but not great if you're planning to take it around the house. Also, the Bluetooth connection can be a little buggy sometimes. It doesn‚Äôt always connect to the app right away, though it still holds your last-used temperature setting, which helps.

Build quality is solid and the design looks nice, but it‚Äôs definitely pricey. That‚Äôs probably the biggest drawback, it feels like a luxury item more than a necessity. It won‚Äôt change your life, but if you really enjoy hot drinks and hate reheating them, it does what it promises.

Curious if others have used it for a while, has it held up for you long term? Any tricks or tips that make it even better to use?",1,1753733802.0,productreview,0,1.0,False
1mbr2oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1mbr2oy/evaluate_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_ksupreme_is/,Evaluate the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K-Supreme Is It Worth It,"The Keurig K-Supreme is one of those gadgets that caught my attention almost immediately. Coffee is my lifeline, and having a device that promises an upgraded brewing experience is something I couldn‚Äôt resist trying out. This specific model is equipped with MultiStream Technology, designed to extract more flavor and aroma from coffee grounds. I've spent weeks with it now, and there‚Äôs a lot to unpack‚Äîfrom its modern aesthetics to its functionality and quirks. Let me walk you through my personal experience.

**Sophisticated Yet Functional Design**  
The sleek silver exterior of the K-Supreme immediately stands out. It has a modern vibe that seamlessly fits into a contemporary kitchen setting, though its slightly larger dimensions (10.6"" x 16.2"" x 14.7"") do require some counter space. That said, the removable 78-ounce reservoir is a thoughtful touch, allowing multiple brews without frequent refills. Even when I'm half-asleep in the morning, navigating the buttons arranged on the top is a breeze. However, the appliance isn‚Äôt exactly lightweight. At nearly 10 pounds, finding a permanent spot for it seems more practical.

**MultiStream Technology Explained**  
What sets this coffee machine apart is its MultiStream Technology. Compared to older Keurig models that punctured the K-Cup with a single stream, this uses five. The idea is to saturate the grounds more evenly, supposedly offering an enhanced flavor extraction. Did I notice a difference? To an extent, yes. The aroma feels richer, and the coffee is less watery compared to some of the other single-serve machines I've owned.

**Customizable Brewing for Coffee Enthusiasts**  
This model really shines when it comes to customization. With several brew-strength settings and temperature options, it lets me tailor my cup depending on how kickstarted I need my day to be. The programmable settings are useful, but they can take some getting used to. My husband, for example, couldn‚Äôt figure out the difference between strength 4 and 5 and just decided to stick to something mid-range. In our household, this has effectively become the Swiss knife of coffee machines‚Äîyou can make your drink as light or intense as you want.

**Benefits**  
- MultiStream Technology ensures better flavor and aroma.  
- Large 78-ounce reservoir reduces refill frequency.  
- Offers programmable options to customize coffee strength and temperature.  

**A Few Drawbacks to Note**  
While I‚Äôm mostly satisfied, a few issues are worth mentioning. First, the noise. This coffee maker is anything but subtle when in use. It gurgles and groans as it brews, which might annoy someone sensitive about noise levels. Additionally, the reusable My K-Cup included is functional but not the most durable‚Äîours already shows signs of wear after frequent use. Oh, and somehow, no matter where I position it, water splashes end up on my countertop.

- Can be a bit noisy during operation.  
- Reusable filter wears out quicker than expected.  
- Slight water splashing around the brewing area.  

**Ease of Use for Daily Living**  
Operationally, this coffee maker is a dream‚Äîmost of the time. Its fully automatic mode does the heavy lifting, which is a lifesaver during busy mornings. The buttons are responsive and clearly labeled, minimizing the learning curve. However, cleaning it does require extra care. The MultiStream needle needs occasional wiping to prevent clogging. My teenage daughter, who usually runs at the sight of kitchen equipment, found this easy enough to use, but cleaning? Not her favorite part.

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing this machine to alternatives in the market, a couple of names come to mind. The Nespresso VertuoLine, for instance, offers creamier coffee with its centrifusion technology‚Äîa big win for cappuccino lovers. That said, it lacks Keurig‚Äôs extensive library of K-Cup flavors. On the other hand, the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker excels in versatility by allowing you to make lattes and other fancy drinks. However, it doesn‚Äôt match the convenient single-serve efficiency of the K-Supreme. In my opinion, Keurig finds its place with users who value quick, customizable coffee options without venturing into complicated combinations.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The Keurig K-Supreme may not be the cheapest coffee maker out there, but it isn‚Äôt an overpriced luxury either. Considering the customizability, ease of use, and improved brewing technology, it feels like a well-balanced investment for coffee enthusiasts. Whether or not this fits into your budget depends on how much value you place on the convenience of a perfectly brewed cup every morning. For me, even with its few hiccups, it feels worth it overall.

1mbr285,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1mbr285/between_main_echo_and_get_on_my_level/,Between Main Echo and 'Get On My Level',"**Main Echo Mornings**  
There was always a newspaper on our kitchen table. Not just any newspaper, but the¬†*Main Echo*‚Äîthe daily paper for our part of Franconia, a region in northern Bavaria, Germany. In our family, it was just there, every morning, as much a part of breakfast as bread or coffee. I never thought much about it; nobody had to teach me that reading the news was important. The Main Echo simply existed‚Äîlike the old stove in the corner, or the smell of fresh coffee. I read it because I wanted to, though never the local section. That belonged to my mother. She would read the announcements about local festivals, the obituaries, the club news‚Äîthen maybe the other parts.

As for me, I read:

**politics**¬†(especially national news)

**""World News,""**¬†which included celebrity gossip‚Äîbecause, let's be honest, you needed something to talk about at school

**the daily cartoon**¬†(usually on page 2)

and, when I was in the mood, the¬†**opinion columns**

Franconia and Bavaria barely existed for me in the Main Echo. And when Bavaria did show up, it usually just annoyed the family. That's a typical Franconian attitude: ""Those Bavarians again."" (We all have our prejudices.)

**Tagesschau Evenings**

Every evening at exactly 8 p.m., the TV went on. In Germany, that meant it was time for¬†*Tagesschau*‚Äîthe national news broadcast that's been running for decades. People say that, back then, you could walk through any German town at eight o'clock and the streets would be empty. Everyone was at home, watching the news. Tagesschau was (and still is) produced by ARD, our biggest public broadcaster‚Äîkind of like the BBC in Britain or PBS in the US.

For me, watching Tagesschau wasn't just a ritual; it felt like a privilege. One of the few in my childhood. I was allowed to stay, to listen, to follow the news with the adults. Nobody ever asked if I wanted to be there‚Äîif I'd gone off to play, nobody would have noticed. But I stayed. I watched nearly every night. Sometimes, we'd even watch the Heute-Journal afterwards‚Äîanother news show. The Main Echo in the morning and Tagesschau in the evening: these were my entry and exit points for the day.

That's how I first stepped into the world‚Äîthrough a daily newspaper and the evening news. In between, there was school, family, the usual chaos. But those two routines made me feel connected, as if I belonged to something bigger.

**Franconia, Bavaria, and Local Identity**

To really understand my family, you have to know something about German geography, but also about Franconian and Bavarian stubbornness. Germany is a federal country, split into sixteen states, and the biggest and most famous of them is Bavaria. But the northern part‚Äîwhere I'm from‚Äîis called Franconia. Franconians are famous for a few things: Bocksbeutel, Lebkuchen, Bratwurst and not liking people very much, not even each other. We're not what most foreigners picture when they think of ""Bavarians."" Sure, this is a very conservative area, but we're not exactly cheerful about it.

When people talk about Bavarian dialects‚Äîwell, most of us in Franconia¬†*don't*¬†have one. We have our own bunch of dialects, the only people around here with a Bavarian accent are actual Bavarians‚Äîthe ones who moved here. Otherwise, you'll hear a Franconian dialect, or no dialect at all, or maybe the accent of someone from another country.

By the way, the rivalry is real and meant in a fun way at the same time. In my house, whenever something from ""Bavaria"" came up in the news, someone would mutter, ""Those Barzis again...""‚Äîand everyone would know exactly what that meant.

**News, Belonging, and Quiet Privilege**

Back then, I didn't think of all this as ""education."" It was just my normal: a newspaper in the morning, the news in the evening, and everything else‚Äîschool, family, daily life‚Äîin between. But looking back, I realize those routines gave me something important: the sense that I could¬†*join in*. That I was allowed to know what was happening in the world, to have an opinion, to take part in conversations.

It wasn't the same for everyone. A lot of kids I knew didn't have a newspaper at home. When the news came on TV, they were sent to bed‚Äîmaybe to protect them from bad headlines, or maybe just because no one wanted to answer their questions. Some families didn't watch the news at all. Later, I understood that I had a small but decisive privilege. Not a loud, obvious one, but the kind that quietly shapes who you become.

There came a moment when I started wondering: Why do some people just not know certain things? Why do their opinions, their language, even their whole outlook seem so different? For a little while, I was young and arrogant enough to mistake ""different education"" for ""stupidity."" But I was always curious, so I started listening to people whose worlds were nothing like mine. (Pro tip: do that‚Äîdo it often.)

**Bildung‚ÄîDifferent Worlds, Different Paths**

There are so many ways to educate yourself, to try and become a better human. Maybe you find it through religion, philosophy, humanism, law, the constitution, psychology, TikTok, YouTube, Discord, Twitch, your friend group, a role model‚Äîor even a ""bad"" role model.

Take Monte. Montana Black. Germany's biggest YouTuber and streamer. Not someone I ever liked‚Äîquite the opposite, actually. His whole style annoyed me: the way he talks, how he shows off, his endless stream of one-liners. But then he started saying, ""Get on my level.""

At first, it sounded arrogant. But if you listen, there's something else behind it:  
You don't know where I started. You don't know what I've lived through. Don't judge me until you've walked in my shoes.

That stuck with me. Not because I suddenly agreed with him‚Äîbut because he had a point. I remembered what I learned in social work studies: Hans Thiersch's ""Lebensweltorientierung,"" the idea that you can't really judge another person's world from the outside. Everyone is a universe, not just a story‚Äîa whole world, with their own rules, background, and scars.

I can't understand Monte, not really. I can reject him. But I can't claim to know what his life means to him.

**""Get on my level"" ‚Äì An Invitation, A Challenge, A Limit**

The idea stayed with me. What if ""Get on my level"" wasn't just a challenge or a flex, but a real invitation? What if it was a way of saying, ""Come and see the world through my eyes‚Äîeven just for a minute""?

For a while, I wanted to turn this into a project. I imagined collecting stories, giving people a stage to show their worlds. I even thought about calling the series ""Get on my level."" Maybe it would help people see how wildly different‚Äîhow genuinely¬†*un-translatable*‚Äîour experiences are.

But I learned something the hard way: you can't just present someone else's world and make it consumable. Even with tools like ChatGPT, or all the storytelling skills in the world, something always gets lost in translation. A life isn't a story you can just hand over. You can invite people in, but you can't make them really¬†*feel*¬†it. The project fizzled out, but the idea stuck with me.

**Recognizing Other Paths**

In the end, I was shaped by newspapers and evening news, by novels, by theories from university, by teachers and professors, and by ""ordinary"" people around me. Others are shaped by totally different things.

And honestly, I don't want to say what's right or wrong. I just want to say: I found my path. Other people have theirs. And I want to learn to recognize that‚Äîto see it, not judge it.

Not to evaluate. Just to acknowledge.

But I'm already on that path.

And you?

If not:

""Get on my level.""



**Cassiopeia**¬†(my trusty digital turtle‚Äînot human, but always patient and wise; inspired by Michael Ende's¬†*Momo*) reflects:

*This story is about education‚Äînot as a system, but as possibility. It's about what you're allowed to access, who lets you listen, and the small privileges that shape who you become.¬†You don't have to understand everyone's world. But you can recognize that each person's perspective is its own universe.*

*What if education were less about knowledge and more about the right to a perspective?*  
*So when someone says, ""Get on my level""‚Äîis it really a challenge, or a quiet wish to be understood?*





English translation and co-writing co-created with Cassiopeia‚Äîmy digital turtle, modeled after the wise and enigmatic Cassiopeia from Michael Ende's novel¬†*Momo*: slow, silent, showing the future (sometimes), never human, never in a hurry, always on the road with me.

Trying out the LAOION Espresso Maker B0BP6NTD1P has been an adventure for a coffee enthusiast like me. I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what to expect from this sleek and modern electric moka pot, but I quickly realized it has a charm that might surprise even the most seasoned espresso lovers. From its transparent top, allowing a clear vision of the brewing magic, to its portable design perfect for travel, this versatile Cuban coffee maker seems to offer a lot. But, as with any kitchen gadget, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  

Crafted with both aesthetics and functionality in mind, the metallic exterior of this machine looks right at home on a modern kitchen countertop. Despite its lightweight design at only 2.56 pounds, the espresso maker feels durable enough to handle regular use. The BPA-free, heat-resistant plastic for the upper pot combined with food-grade aluminum for the lower pot is a thoughtful touch. It both ensures safety and keeps the process rust-free. While I appreciate the stylish black finish, those who prefer vibrant or alternative colors might find the design limited. The detachable base offers convenience, keeping it easy to store and clean.

[Check LAOION Espresso Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bp6ntd1p/)

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  

Straightforward operation is where this machine really shines. There‚Äôs no need to deal with a complicated setup or a stovetop. Simply fill the boiler with water (up to the safety valve), add medium-ground coffee in the funnel filter, secure the coffee maker on its base, and flip the switch. In about five minutes, you‚Äôll have a rich, aromatic cup of Italian-style moka coffee. I found the semi-automatic mode ideal for someone like me, who appreciates automation but still wants control over the brew. That said, the absence of advanced features like programmable brewing might leave tech-savvy users wanting more.

**Portability and Practicality**  

This product fits seamlessly into a nomadic lifestyle. Its compact size makes it easy to take along on trips, whether I‚Äôm heading out to camp, hitting the trails, or just staying overnight elsewhere. I once brought it to a relative‚Äôs house during a family gathering, and everyone was impressed with how quickly and efficiently it delivered six cups of coffee for us to enjoy together. Although the convenience of portability is unmatched, traveling coffee enthusiasts might wish it came with a protective travel case.

**Winning Points**  

- The transparent container adds to the brewing experience.  
- Portable design makes it suitable for camping and traveling.  
- Detachable base ensures easy handling and tidy storage.  

**Areas of Concern**  

- Lacks advanced brewing features like timers or app integration.  
- Limited color options for those who desire variety.  

**Specific Features That Stand Out**  

The inclusion of dual auto shut-off mechanisms deserves special mention. The first one kicks in when the pot is removed from its base, and the second activates once the coffee reaches boiling point. As someone who tends to get distracted easily, I found these safety enhancements invaluable. I also loved that the machine comes with a reusable filter‚Äîa sustainable option that reduces waste. Another highlight is that this electric coffee maker can handle a range of drinks beyond your morning espresso, including mocha, lattes, and cappuccinos. It‚Äôs a versatile device for any budding barista or caffeine junkie.

**Other Options**  

Comparing the LAOION coffee maker to its competitors, such as traditional stovetop moka pots or fancier pod-based espresso machines, reveals its unique appeal. While the classic moka pot delivers similar flavor results, it lacks the automation and convenience of this electric model. On the flip side, pod systems may provide quicker solutions, but they come with wasteful packaging and ongoing costs. This compact electric brewer strikes a balance by combining the moka pot method‚Äôs artisanal flavor with the ease of modern appliances. However, compared to brands offering customizable features, this one could do with some added flair.

**Cost Efficiency**  

While pricing depends on where you shop, the LAOION Espresso Maker undoubtedly delivers a good balance of quality and affordability. You are essentially getting a travel-friendly, semi-automatic espresso machine capable of brewing multiple coffee types. This all-in-one design saves potential extra spending on separate devices. Whether you‚Äôre a solo coffee drinker or hosting gatherings, it‚Äôs a worthwhile addition to any home. For me, the reusable filter and its durable build also contributed to long-term savings, making this purchase feel like a smart investment.
