I look at my phone and I've got a bunch of happy birthday texts. The first one is from my mom (who hasn't spoken to me in almost a month) wishing me happy bday and asking to FaceTime me later. Minutes later I got some others from family members who never reached out and are now like ""we missed you at Easter, want to see you, have a great day, happy Bday!"" I know my mom sent them all a group text telling them it was my bday and asking them to wish me happy bday. She does that kind of thing. Anytime she is sick or something she always tells the whole group text for attention/prayers. When my baby was in nicu she told so many people; over 500 people (mostly strangers) knew my business for ""prayers"". 

I'm conflicted because on one hand im thinking she cares (old naive self) and on another im thinking she's lovebombing me (new aware self) and all these previously mute family members are just joining in or texting me out of obligation or just an insincere shallow thing that they wouldn't have done if my mom hadn't told them to. Tell me why I'm so mad? It's kind of silly to be mad about being wished happy birthday.

1kbhep5,https://youtube.com/@codehq_24_7?si=r1KqDZVh-OoFMyeF,"Today in Code HQ (April 30): AI's Having an Existential Crisis, Rust is Flexing, and Why My Python Code Tried to Kill Me","Hey nerds, devs, bug whisperers, and AI prompt poets,

Welcome to your daily dose of “What in the compiler is going on today?” — brought to you by Code HQ, a new micro-community where we solve bugs, share brain-melting breakthroughs, and occasionally cry in semicolons.

Let’s dive into the weird and wonderful coding world of April 30, 2025:


---

1. AI Now Explains Its Code… And Might Be Smarter Than You

Today, MIT and Meta released a new paper about an AI model that not only writes code — it explains it like a professor who had too much coffee.

It doesn’t just give you a function. It tells you why it exists, what each line does, and occasionally, might offer unsolicited life advice.

Why this matters:
If this gets good enough, Stack Overflow might have to rebrand as “Just Vibes.” This could change how we learn programming forever — or become your passive-aggressive coding buddy.


---

2. Rust Just Leveled Up (Again)

Rust isn’t just “the language that breaks your brain and heals your soul.” It’s now deeper in the Linux 6.10 kernel, which means the language that sounds like a fantasy RPG weapon is now writing the future of operating systems.

Fun fact:
If Rust gets any more traction, your next toaster might refuse to run unless it's memory-safe.


---

3. NASA's Using Python on Mars

Yes, Mars. The red one.

NASA is using Python scripts to simulate rover movements, test commands, and basically do cool sci-fi stuff. So next time someone tells you Python is “just for beginners,” ask them if their code has literally gone to space.


---

4. Fun Zone: Meme of the Day

> When your AI-generated code runs perfectly on the first try:
“I fear no man… but that thing… it scares me.”



Or this gem:
git commit -m ""Final final really final fixed version""
We all know what that means.


---

5. GitHub Gem of the Day: Vercel’s Satori

If you’re into turning JSX into slick SVGs, check out vercel/satori. It’s fast, clean, and makes rendering SVGs feel less like witchcraft.


---

P.S. I Built a Community for Folks Like Us

If you like this kind of madness — the breakthroughs, the bugs, the memes, the Mars-level Python — I’ve created a small (but mighty) community:

> r/CodeHQ– A new hangout spot for coding problem-solving, the latest dev news, and fresh AI-powered chaos.



We post 2–3 times daily, and it’s a mix of:

Brain fuel (latest tools & trends)

Debug disasters

Code wars

The occasional emotional support meme


Come be an early member and help shape it from the ground up. Who knows — one day you'll brag about how you joined before it went viral.

My friend and I explained to her how it isnt  our fault if it's the system which can't cancel it, she kept giving excuses and started telling us that previous costumers ordered 10 coffees by accident and they gave them 5 and the other were compensated to them later when they came to the cafe. After some back and forth, I paid for 4 drinks because she said she could only cancel one and not two (sounded like bullshit).

But I developed a kind of attachment that's still hard to get rid of.

I downloaded Hinge and Bumble for the first time to try and see if this would help me get over my so-called relationship. I made a slight pseudo account because I knew I wouldn't be able to get along with someone. This rebound wasn't going to work. I got asked out by a few men for coffee and strolls. I ghosted them. I deleted both the apps. Those guys were cute, but I didn't want them to be burdened with my mental chaos.

I was even asked out by a junior for coffee after we kept bumping into each other accidentally on several occasions. I didn't ping him back. My ex-batchmate keeps DMing me, trying his luck. He's hot and smart, but he creeps me out with his texts. So, nah. I can't get myself to see other people.

1kbhcdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kbhcdr/does_the_paracity_french_press_coffee_maker/,Does the PARACITY French Press Coffee Maker Deliver Great Value Review,"Exploring the ins and outs of the **PARACITY PARACITY-FP350 French Press** has been quite the journey. As someone who loves starting the day with a steaming cup of coffee, I was eager to see how this product would hold up. It's compact, lightweight, and has a modern flair that immediately drew me in. Whether I was brewing tea, frothing milk, or just experimenting with different kinds of coffee, this little press had plenty to offer. But it wasn’t all roses – there are definitely things you should know before diving in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This French Press boasts a sleek and compact design that is both visually appealing and practical. Its borosilicate glass is heat-resistant—perfect for someone like me, who isn’t always the most graceful. It’s framed in a sturdy polypropylene plastic (it’s surprisingly lightweight without feeling cheap) and features a stainless steel filter that promises durability. On one particularly rushed morning, I even managed to knock it over, and it didn’t so much as crack, which endeared it to me entirely. But if you’re used to heftier builds, the plastic edges might not feel quite as premium in your hands. Its compact size fits snugly on my cluttered kitchen counter without guzzling up real estate, making it a convenient choice for smaller kitchens. 

**Ease of Use**  
I’m all about convenience before my first coffee of the day, and this press scores high in this department. Brewing a robust cup of coffee is as simple as adding grounds, pouring in hot water, and pressing slowly. On one lazy Sunday, I even tried my hand at cold brews with it; the results were pretty impressive. Everything comes apart for easy cleaning, and being dishwasher-safe is a big plus for me. If you’re someone who dreads finicky cleanup routines, this press sidesteps that nightmare altogether. However, the handle feels slightly wobbly when dismantling the apparatus, which made me wonder how it might hold up over extended use.

**Heat Retention Capabilities**  
A pleasant surprise was how well this French Press retains heat during brewing. While I wouldn’t call it a thermal miracle, the borosilicate glass kept my coffee warm for just long enough to savor it at a leisurely pace. I’ve used similar products that cool too quickly, leaving me to gulp down lukewarm coffee, but this one avoids that flaw rather well. That said, if you’re nursing a second cup over more time, an insulated carafe might be a better option.

[Don’t miss PARACITY PARACITY-FP350 deals—check Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bn3rhjcz/)

**Versatility**  
One of the standout features of this coffee maker is its versatility. Besides being a reliable French Press, it’s also capable of frothing milk or brewing tea, and on one family camping trip, it even doubled as a small fruit infuser. Its 11.8-ounce capacity lends itself best to those needing a personal-sized beverage or, perhaps, two smaller servings. If you’re like me and often crave variety, you’ll appreciate its multitasking abilities. However, for a group setting or larger quantities, its compact size falls short.

**Positives**  
Here are some strong points that stood out to me while using this French Press:  
- The ultrafine stainless steel filter tackles coffee grounds incredibly well, ensuring smooth coffee without gritty textures.  
- Compact and portable, it’s a dream for camping trips or small kitchens.
- Dishwasher-safe and quick to disassemble, cleaning is a breeze.  
- The glass and plastic combo deliver a lightweight but heat-resistant finish.  

**Potential Shortcomings**  
No product is perfect, and this one isn’t an exception. A few areas left me wanting more:  
- The glass, while sturdy, isn’t thermal—and doesn’t hold heat as long as metal alternatives.  
- Its size isn’t cut out for brewing large quantities, making it awkward for entertaining.  
- The handle feels a bit light and wobbly during assembly or dismantling.

**Competitive Options**  
When sizing this up against competitors, a few products immediately came to mind. Comparing it to the Bodum Chambord, for instance, shows clear differences. The Bodum’s all-metal frame feels more premium, but it also comes in heavier and less portable. Meanwhile, the Stanley Adventure All-In-One French Press excels in rugged durability and insulation, tailored to outdoor pros or those more spill-prone than me. For everyday use, however, the PARACITY-FP350 is more convenient with its easy-clean design and lighter build—it fits better into casual routines without overkill features.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Affordability can make or break a product’s value for me, and this French Press does land on the more budget-friendly side. While it lacks the luxurious materials found in high-end alternatives, the combination of performance and price makes it a worthy contender. It punches above its weight for single-use brewing and casual coffee drinkers. For those seeking no-frills quality without dropping too much cash, it delivers solid results for its cost—especially if you’re a regular camper like me, where portability becomes doubly important.

1- Afnan- Turathi blue: This one is a summer great. A strong grapefruit note makes it fresh without being too sweet. Thought it would be stronger and you have to get close to me to smell it. Also not the strongest in terms of longevity but still love it.
2. Lattafa - Khamrah Qawha - In love with this. Due to the strong coffee note it makes it more manly I fell when you compare it to other similar scents. My girlfriend especially loves this one as well as the next one. 
3. Lattafa - Liam Grey - Wow. My favourite at the moment. It is supposed to be more of a winter fragrance but I feel like you can rock this in summer without any problems. Versitale, different, completely love it.
4. Pacific Blue- On the fence about it. People have mixed feelings about this one and I can see why. Although it is very fresh and strong I grew up in not the richest family and it definitely brings back memories of the cheap window and floor cleaners my mom used. In a way it makes it more special somehow? Still very conflicted about it and it it hard to choose this for the day when I have a choice of the others.
5. Coral Blush - This one is great. A very strong peach note makes it a bit specific and I can see why it would not be everyone’s cup of tea but it is mine. Strong, fresh, fun, as well as a bit mysterious. I love it and will use frequently. 
6. Winsome (The Tux). - Well this is an odd one. Never have used something similar and will have to get used to it. I am 22 years old and don’t know how this fits me although I like dressing for an occasion. My girlfriend hates it sadly. Maybe it needs time and I hope I grow to like it.

But its true cathedral was the Town Hall, where politics reigned more fiercely than any faith.

In Levingston, politics wasn’t a hobby. It was a blood sport.

Two parties ruled the streets like rival mobs: the Progressives, wearing blue ties, and the Traditionals, clinging to their fading red banners. And for years, two men embodied the hatred better than anyone — Evan Marrow, a rising star among the Progressives, and Dean Sutter, a Traditionals’ bulldog with a smile made for courtrooms and a temper better suited for back alleys.

They fought everywhere — at debates, town meetings, and even funerals. Once, they nearly came to blows at a Christmas charity drive over whose party funded the turkey donations.

The town fed on their rage like stray dogs around a butcher shop. And the men? They liked the chaos. It gave them relevance. Power. Money.

Then came the audit.

Leaked documents revealed both men had dipped fingers into party funds. Not enough to end their careers outright — but enough to put each other's throats at the ready. Allegations turned into lawsuits. Lawsuits turned into personal attacks. Family members were dragged into public shame. Even death threats came, whispered like bad prayers into Evan’s mailbox and Dean’s voicemail.

Yet, strangely, the police never pressed charges. The parties held the cops in their pockets like coins. In Levingston, power was its own law.

But hatred… hatred obeys no law.

On the night of the town's Founders' Day Festival, the air was thick with barbecue smoke, sweat, and beer. A parade of red and blue streamers whipped through the streets like dueling serpents. 

Evan drank too much at a private gathering at the old Freeman Barn. His words slurred, his laughter bitter. 

""They think they can buy me out. Blackmail me into leaving politics,"" he told a small circle of drunken friends. ""Dean’s finished. His blood will stain that courthouse.”

He thought it was just angry talk.

He didn’t know Dean was already watching him from the dark woods beyond the bonfire. Dean's mind had been gnawed hollow by months of rage, fear, and the sweet, poisonous idea that he could make it all end.

Not a word of warning.

Not a shouted threat.

When Evan stumbled into the woods to piss, Dean followed — boots silent on the dead leaves, knife heavy in his palm.

The first stab was clumsy, ripping into Evan’s ribs. A gasp, not a scream. Evan turned, wide-eyed, mouth working for a word — apology, insult, prayer — but Dean was already plunging the knife again, again, with a frenzy that shocked even himself.

Dean dropped the body face-down among the roots, where the blood soaked into the dirt like the town’s own corrupt confession. He wiped the blade on Evan’s expensive coat and stumbled back toward the lights of the party.

By morning, Evan Marrow was a missing person's case.

By afternoon, he was a martyr.

By evening, he was a ghost that haunted every conversation.

Whispers grew.

The Progressives blamed the Traditionals. The Traditionals blamed ""unknown elements.""

Dean played his part well — the shocked rival, the grieving opponent.

Shock. Outrage. Candlelight vigils.

Evan's party howled for justice. Dean’s party offered crocodile tears. The cops stumbled through a half-hearted investigation, already under pressure to make it go away fast.

No cameras. No witnesses. No evidence.

It was almost perfect.

Almost.

Dean thought the killing would fix everything.

But killing is messy — not just the blood, but the aftertaste it leaves in your mind.

The first cracks showed at Dean’s own campaign events. He couldn’t meet people's eyes. He snapped at minor questions. He drank before meetings, then during meetings.

His hands — those damned hands — twitched whenever anyone mentioned Evan’s name.

One night, his closest advisor pulled him aside. “You alright, Dean? You look like hell.”

Dean smiled. It felt like pulling his face across broken glass. “Just tired. Long months.”

Inside, something festered. Guilt? No. Not guilt. It was fear. Not just of getting caught — but also of losing control.

Dean realized too late that killing Evan didn’t make him stronger. It made him weaker.

Every small slight now felt like a threat. Every handshake seemed loaded with accusation. Every late-night knock sounded like the police coming to take him.

And the money he killed for? Gone. Eaten up in legal fees, lost donors, bad deals. He wasn't a king. He was a beggar hiding behind a dead man’s shadow.

Six months later, Dean sat alone in his living room, campaign posters peeling off the walls.

An untouched whiskey sweated on the coffee table.

And then the phone rang.

Huan, Dean's friend, A rich businessman, voice oiled with casual power, spoke into Dean’s ear.

""Forget your debts,"" He said. ""Forget the lawsuits. I’ll pay every cent, clear every charge. All I need is a signature.”

""When you're elected next term, the contracts — the ones Evan blocked — will be ours.”

Dean stared at the ceiling, the world spinning slow and mean around him. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t argue.

And like that, his hands were dirtier than ever — bought and owned by men with deeper pockets and blacker hearts.

The election came.

Dean won.

The world forgot Evan Marrow within a year.

The candlelight vigils turned into political speeches.

The anger turned into amnesia.

Only Evan’s family remembered — his wife waking up alone every morning; his children growing up with half a heart; his parents setting one extra plate at Thanksgiving that would never be filled again. They carried the grief while the town carried on.

Levingston had moved on.

But grief doesn't move on. It rots in the bones of the ones left behind.

1kbh4uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1kbh4uf/new_and_confused/,New and confused,"I was diagnosed last June during normal bloodwork (TSH was 9.31). I’m not surprised because my mom and brother have both been diagnosed so I figured it was only a matter of time. Initially it took about 3 months to get the right dose of levothyroxine (I think my doctor overshot it and then had to back track). But after that, bloodwork looked good (TSH 1.99) and I was on 50mcg. Fast forward 4 months and I made a doctors appointment because I’ve been having some other symptoms and she decided it was time to recheck. I had my bloodwork done on Friday and my TSH level was 19! So now we’re increasing my dosage again to 75 mcg. Are these normal fluctuations? Am I going to need to check my thyroid more frequently? My morning routine changed and I now have about 30 minutes before coffee/breakfast, is this the issue?

Also, I’ve been having some weird neck tightness. I have my first ultrasound scheduled in two weeks to check my thyroid. Any ideas on what I should expect now that my TSH levels are elevated again?

I feel like my mom’s thyroid has always been managed so easily. I appreciate and stories or similar experiences to know if this is all a normal part of managing an under active thyroid.

1kbh3ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kbh3ba/can_silonn_slim01b_ice_maker_truly_deliver_a/,Can Silonn SLIM01B Ice Maker Truly Deliver? A Comprehensive Review,"The Silonn SLIM01B Ice Maker has become a bit of a lifesaver in my kitchen over the past couple of weeks, especially given how much I rely on having an ample supply of ice for hosting or simply for my drinks. My experience with it has been a mix of delight and a bit of thoughtful critique. This compact machine, capable of producing 9 ice cubes within 6 minutes, has proven itself handy and efficient, though there’s a bit more to it than just the initial blush of its promising features.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Compact and sleek, the ice maker blends well into any modern kitchen setup without being an eyesore. With dimensions of just 12.3 x 8.7 x 12.5 inches, it fits snugly on my countertop next to the coffee maker. Despite its portability, it feels sturdy, clocking in at around 15.2 pounds. I appreciate how the transparent lid lets me peek at the ice level inside without opening it, keeping the chill in and the curiosity satisfied. The included ice basket and scoop make handling the ice pretty straightforward. While the overall layout is convenient, keeping it clean manually around the edges can be a bit fiddly since there are grooves where water tends to collect.  

**Functionality and Features**  
Here’s what really caught my attention when I started testing this machine: it produces two different sizes of ice cubes. Small cubes are incredibly useful for chilling seafood or quick-cooling drinks, while the larger ones are ideal for beverages like iced coffee or cocktails. It’s also surprisingly quiet—well, as quiet as you'd expect, comparable to a low hum of a fridge. The noise from the ice-making process didn’t disrupt the ambiance when I had guests over, which I find impressive. Plus, the automatic sensor that stops ice production when the basket is full is a thoughtful addition, preventing overflows.  

[Check Silonn SLIM01B Ice Maker price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b08zyj8crx/)  

**Performance and Ice Production**  
Ice-making speed and capacity are where the Silonn machine truly shines. The 6-minute production time for 9 cubes feels almost miraculous—it's basically ready before my cup of tea even cools! With its 2-liter water capacity, it churns out up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours. Let me tell you, this came in really handy during my sibling’s birthday party over the weekend. Everyone had their drinks chilled without having to endure those awkward pauses waiting for ice trays to freeze.  

**Ease of Use**  
The control panel is as intuitive as it gets. A few button presses and you’re on your way. It even has indicator lights for when the water runs low or the basket gets full. Talk about an ice maker with a heads-up display, right? Although I will say, the printed labels on the buttons could benefit from being a bit larger. Anyone squinting might find them a little tricky to read. The self-cleaning function is a godsend as well—just hold the ON/OFF button for five seconds, and it cycles water through the system for you, making maintenance almost effortless.  

**Highlights**  
- Produces up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours.  
- Two ice cube sizes cater to various needs.  
- Built-in self-cleaning mechanism.  
- Noise level is less than 35dB, making it kitchen-friendly.  

**Flaws**  
- Cleaning around the inner edges manually can be a hassle.  
- Button labels could be more legible for easier operation.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this machine to other similar countertop models I’ve seen, such as those from GE Profile or Frigidaire, there are some notable differences. GE’s models tend to have a more premium price tag but include features like app control for remote operation. On the other hand, Frigidaire’s ice makers might have a slightly larger reservoir but aren’t as sleek and compact. The Silonn ice maker strikes a decent balance between affordability and functionality, though it lacks the app connectivity or a larger water tank of its competitors. However, I find its user-friendly interface and portability to be worthwhile trade-offs.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
At its price point, the Silonn SLIM01B offers an excellent balance of quality and utility. Sure, it may lack a few luxurious extras, but for a straightforward and reliable ice maker, it more than justifies its cost. If someone’s in the market for a machine that delivers consistent performance without breaking the bank, this one is a solid contender.

Review Inside!,"The Cuisinart CMW-100 1-Cubic-Foot Stainless Steel Microwave Oven, Brushed Chrome came into my life with the promise of simplifying my daily kitchen routine, and let me give you the scoop based on my hands-on experience. Honestly, testing this microwave felt a lot like moving into a smarter and more practical dimension of kitchen appliances. Everyone in the family’s had their fair share of experimenting with it – from reheating leftover pizza to attempting fancy recipes, this unit has been through a rollercoaster of culinary adventures.

**Eye-catching design and build quality**

This brushed chrome microwave is a treat for anyone who appreciates sleek, modern aesthetics. Its stainless steel interior and exterior not only look stunning but also feel premium and durable. I was initially drawn to the stainless steel interior because, let's face it, cleaning microwaves can be a nightmare. Luckily, with this model, sanitizing is a breeze as the interior doesn't absorb odors. Plus, the dark-tinted glass window paired with the stylish chrome handle makes it feel more high-end than it is.

The dimensions, at 20.5"" x 15.25"" x 12.8"", are a good fit for most countertops, though I’ll admit that it takes up a noticeable chunk of space. Weighing 33.5 pounds, it isn’t something you’d move around too often, but its sturdiness inspires confidence.

**Performance and functionality**

A 1000-watt powerhouse with 10 power levels, this microwave isn’t just about reheating coffee. It delivered consistent and even heating, whether it's warming soup or cooking those frozen meals I rely on during busy workdays. The preprogrammed one-touch controls cover everything from popcorn to fish, and I couldn’t help but appreciate how foolproof the settings were. My favorite feature? The two-stage cooking option. One night, I defrosted chicken straight from the freezer and had it cooked and juicy in one session – no stopping or flipping halfway through.

**Advantages**

The carefully thought-out features stood out as this microwave’s **key benefits**:

- Sleek, brushed chrome design with a high-quality finish.
- Easy-to-clean stainless steel interior that resists lingering smells.
- 25 preprogrammed one-touch settings simplify operation.
- Two-stage cooking takes care of defrosting and cooking in one go.
- The 12-inch rotating glass tray ensures even cooking and heating.

[Check Cuisinart CMW-100 price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b000iw9j20/)

**Programming and usability quirks**

While the touchpad controls with an LCD make the microwave feel modern, it took a bit of trial and error to fully grasp the programming. Switching between power levels or customizing settings sometimes felt less intuitive than I had hoped. The instruction manual included with the unit proved handy, but I think Cuisinart could improve the user interface for a smoother experience.

**Shortcomings**

Despite its impressive performance, this microwave does come with **areas for improvement**:

- Slightly bulky dimensions may be inconvenient for small kitchens.
- Learning curve involved with mastering the control panel.
- No dedicated mute button for quieter operation at odd hours.

**Challengers in the market**

Comparing this model to peer products, like Panasonic’s NN-SN686S model, reveals some interesting distinctions. While Panasonic models often boast cutting-edge inverter technology for ultra-precise cooking, the Cuisinart doesn't quite match that level of finesse. However, where the Panasonic models may feel overly complicated for regular users, the Cuisinart CMW-100 balances user-friendliness with enough versatility to satisfy both casual and serious cooks. Additionally, the stainless steel interior of the Cuisinart is an edge over basic plastic interiors in many alternatives, both in terms of hygiene and durability.

**Affordable Quality**

The pricing feels justified for a high-quality appliance like this one. Compared to pricier competitors with similar wattage and features, this microwave stands as a well-rounded choice for value-conscious shoppers. The durable build, reliable performance, and premium aesthetic make it worth every penny without feeling like you’ve splurged unnecessarily.

It kept me away from my color.","I was always told brown leaning lipsticks were 90's and dated. I kept trying to find my color - been looking on and off for 10 years. Kept trying different shades of pink, purple, red, and recently orange. Kept looking like a clown. Limping by on the shades that ""look pretty"" I got typed as a deep/true autumn. Somewhere in there. Someone in another thread mentioned I try a brick red/brown and in looking for a brick red I ended up hearing the same color over and over in here - REVLON - RUM RAISIN - Googled it and it's in every ""The 90's are back!"" article and I've always seen brown as a 90's thing as well so I was skeptical.

WELL... let me tell you. You guys saved my life. I felt awful buying it at the store, it looked like chocolate in the tube. I put it on, I look in the mirror and my husband and I were in SHOCK. It was the one! A red that finally pulled red on me without being too much. It made my brown eyes look lighter and gold, it evened me out so that everything was equal and not all about my lips. Now I've tried Revlon's - Toast of New York, and Coffee Bean as well and I'm in love with these ""Brown"" lipsticks. I never would have picked it up on my own in a million years. Thankyou. I am just so sad I didn't figure it out sooner I'm getting close to 30 and would have loved to rock the look sooner. 

TLDR: Why did Lipsticks that look brown get labeled as an era, or go out of style?  Don't be afraid to give them a try because they look so brown in the tube or on some people, for some people this color is awesome everyday wear. ",4,1746021169.0,MakeupAddiction,5,1.0,False
1kbh2d0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbh2d0,10 Day 1.5 Bag Sports mom Travel - trip report,"A few weeks ago, I shared a post about packing 1.5 bags for my daughter’s 10-day travel tournament (3 day tournament, 7 day exploring) in a major city. Here’s the full trip report, along with updated graphics.

(Bonus: I created a reusable travel checklist template in Goodnotes based on this experience.)

10-Day Chicago Trip Overview
* Purpose: 3-day tournament, 2 travel days, 5 days sightseeing/shopping/museums
* Weather: Highs 50s–70s, lows in the 40s, occasional rain

(Everything packed is noted in my infographics. For a complete list of clothing capsule item brands and purchase locations, please see my original post.)

Clothing Capsule

* Tops: 4 tanks/shirts, 3 toppers (including long cardigan, jean jacket, oversized sweat shirt)
* Bottoms: 3 pants/crops
* Shoes: 3 pairs (including Birkenstock clogs, tennies)
* Bags: 1 Longchamp tote, 1 backpack (travel/sports gear)
* Other: Swimsuit (hotel spa), hat
* Team spirit attire- 1 fleece vest, 1 tank, 1 hat


Pre-trip adjustments:
* Swapped bulky team hoodie for tank
* Removed soft pants

Laundry: In-room laundry done twice

Clothing Wins

* Great quantity—20 unique outfits (only 4 unworn)
* Comfy, quick-drying, and compact
* Could have easily fit all clothes in backpack
* Perfect layering options for variable weather
* Longchamp tote was ideal for daily use
* Never missed the raincoat, I decided against.   

MVP Clothing Items:

* Vuori cami/jogger set – versatile, comfy, wore daily in-room
* Gray cardigan – great for layering and hotel wear
* Birkenstock clogs – hotel and recovery wear
* Longchamp La Pliage tote – packable and perfect for outings

Clothing Could-Be-Better
* Should have packed a lightweight sleep shirt (sharing a room with teen daughter)
* Tennies needed more break-in; painful early days with long wear
* Long cardigan took forever to dry (spilled coffee, only washed once)

Other Travel MVPs
* Nalgene bottle – lightweight, clipped to bag, perfect size
* Mini claw clips – perfect for keeping hair up
* Pocket pharmacy – used daily (IBU, Tylenol, Excedrin)
* Shout wipes – worked better than Tide pens
* Fold-up shopping bags – used daily for dirty clothes, groceries, wet suits, etc.

Packing/Travel/Kitchen Setup
* Used kettle and griddle daily for breakfast and light meals
* Laundry line was key for drying, thank you for the dry bag and rinse less laundry pack suggestions! 
* Toiletry case is a dialed-in system (just check expiration/levels before trips)
* eBags Mother Lode hybrid carry-on – durable, efficient (minor internal wear noted). It is half hard, half soft side. Was smaller than every other standard carryon on I saw at airport, including daughter’s hard side Mono’s standard carryon. 
* Easily fit tournament hoodie and extra shirts for return in my carryon bag. 

Packing and reduced kitchen equipment Lessons Learned

* Bring small spatula for griddle
* Pack reusable utensils or small disposable set, was not able to find small packages at location. 
* Include a few baggies/containers for meals/snacks, same issue as above. 
* Add small dish soap
* Skipped using curling iron and laptop, could have left home. 
* Ran out of foundation, forgot to restock
* Forgot new razor heads  and period supplies, had to purchase. 

Final Thoughts

The setup worked really well! Travel felt lighter, more agile, and packing/unpacking was smooth. Kitchen/food prep setup needs slight tweaks, but nothing unmanageable. Daughter shared items (shoes, sweater) and also traveled carry-on only. Planning to continue this 1.5-bag method for upcoming 2.5-week summer trip.",6,1746021150.0,HerOneBag,0,1.0,False
1kbh2ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/1kbh2ci/to_those_starting_or_considering_a_masters_in/,To Those Starting or Considering a Master’s in Public Policy or Public Administration: A Candid Look at the Job Market Right Now,"Hi everyone, I've been largely dormant since last year's admission cycle. I am wrapping up my degree program at Harvard Kennedy and have been observing some trends that I wanted to share. I’m not trying to sound alarmist or discouraging, but I do want to offer a sober assessment of the employment landscape, especially for folks who may be banking on a fairly traditional career trajectory in the public sector.

**This post is not intended to be political.** My goal is to help folks think strategically about risk, timeline, and job prospects. I’ve learned a lot from this community, and I wanted to give back by sharing a few reflections for incoming or current students in public administration and policy programs. This is just a sobering snapshot of the job market right now. Take what resonates and leave what doesn’t.

1. **The DC Job Market is the Most Competitive It’s Been in Years**

It is **extraordinarily difficult** to secure policy or government-related roles in Washington, DC right now — even entry-level ones. This isn't new, but the degree of difficulty has escalated dramatically. To be blunt, applying to jobs in DC now feels similar to applying for a job at Google or Meta. And I don’t say that lightly.

* I recently spoke with a former Chief of Staff to a member of Congress who now works as a lobbyist. He confirmed what I’ve heard from Hill staffers, think tank researchers, and nonprofit directors: offices are routinely receiving 500 to 1,000 applications for ***basic*** positions.
* Positions that used to go to recent grads or early-career professionals are now seeing applications from senior-level staffers who’ve been displaced or laid off.
* Connections matter more than ever. DC has always been about “who you know,” but that’s no longer just a leg up, it’s almost a requirement. At this point, everyone knows someone INCREDIBLY qualified who is unemployed vying for that same job. So the network plus almost becomes negated with so many people unemployed and applying for jobs.
* The federal layoffs caused by administrative changes are having ripple effects throughout the policy ecosystem. Even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against these policies, it’s not a guarantee that jobs will return quickly, or at all. Personally, I think if SCOTUS re-instates people there will just be another round of lay offs that will sideline workers until things work up the appellate chain again. (But that's just one man's take).

If you’re targeting a federal role or a nonprofit position in DC, you’ll need to either:

* Line up a competitive internship (remote or in-person),
* Network intensely and early (preferably in-person coffees, I spent my spring break in D.C. networking),
* Attend as many networking event and trade association cocktails you can get into (especially as a student often free!),
* Be prepared for a potentially long job hunt.

# 2. State and Local Policy Roles Are Also Becoming More Competitive

Many people assume that if DC is inaccessible, they can shift focus to state or local roles. That strategy makes sense in theory/under normal market circumstances, but in practice, those jobs are also tightening, again, largely due to the trickle-down effect of federal layoffs.

* Seasoned professionals who previously worked in federal roles or national nonprofits are applying for local government jobs, regional advocacy roles, or state-level analyst positions. These applicants are now competing alongside new grads.
* In short: the market is contracting from the top down. Jobs that used to be solid options for grad school graduates are now attracting applicants with 5–10 years of experience who are out of work and willing to step down in title or pay.

# 3. Consulting and Nonprofit Sectors Are Shedding Jobs Too

Even those aiming to work in government consulting, implementation firms, or large-scale nonprofits are feeling the effects of this shift.

* Many consulting firms are losing major federal contracts. When those contracts dry up, so do the jobs. We're starting to see these coming in, a bit delayed in comparison to the nonprofit space.
* This is no surprise given 501C3s were hit pretty much immediately. Nonprofits that rely heavily on federal funding are downsizing or restructuring entirely. For instance, the Council of State Governments recently laid off 50% of its staff due to lost federal contracts, check out LinkedIn to verify. That’s not a one-off situation. Similar cutbacks are occurring in other mid-sized organizations and networks.

  
**What Does This Mean for Graduate Students or Incoming Applicants?**



1. **Minimize Financial Risk**

This **cannot** be stressed enough: be mindful of debt. Student loans are a long-term burden, and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), while incredibly valuable, has been politically targeted for years. No one can guarantee it will exist in the same form when you graduate.

* Go to the best program that offers the ***most scholarship money***, not necessarily the highest-ranked name. I attended HKS because it gave me a full scholarship. Otherwise, the price of tuition at HKS and housing costs in Cambridge, in this economy and uncertainty, makes it practically unjustifiable in all other circumstances. 
* If you're choosing between prestige and funding, lean toward funding. You can build reputation through your work.  You can’t erase debt as easily.
* Many schools have fellowships and scholarships AFTER the first year based on grades. Be on the look out for those. Centers, if they have money, often have fellowships awarded to students who did well in a particular field and those open up around winter or spring. It can be a way to cut down costs when you might not have gotten a good initial funding package.

# 

2. **Start Job Searching Early**

The traditional job search timeline doesn’t work anymore. If you’re graduating in May, don’t wait until February or March to begin applying.

* I began networking in **October** and started applying to jobs in **December**.
* Your first few applications and interviews will likely be shaky, mine were, so give yourself runway to improve.
* By February, I had applied to around eight jobs and done over 30 informational interviews. I felt practiced and prepared, even though I still faced mostly rejections. Only like 5 of my informational interviews led to job leads. The rest were friendly conversations and some times people would email me stuff that may/may not have been on point. But it was nice they were still engaged!
* I got an original job offer, **that lost funding**, in late March. They moved funding from one area to another high priority area due to what has been going on in D.C. It fucking **SUCKED** and was soul crushing. I quite literally almost gave up and waited until summer to start applying. Glad I didn't.
* I didn’t land my current full-time job until **early April.** It’s fully remote and flexible, which was a huge plus. But it took months of groundwork to get here. 
* I purposefully took a lower course load in the Spring (3 courses) so that I had plenty of time to apply to jobs and networks. My Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays were all free. I highly suggest taking the lowest full time course load the spring you graduate to fully commit to the job search because it is a full-time job in itself. And, if you land a job offer or get further enough in the interview process, you can show them you have barely any school work to do and can at least offer like 30 hours a week.

# 

3. **Career Services Have Limits / Find a Mentor**

Career centers are helpful, but they’re not magic. I maxed out their usefulness after three or four appointments.

* What *did* help was developing a relationship with **one counselor** who went to bat for me. He introduced me to people, forwarded jobs, and helped me strategize.
* One of my last meetings with me he complained about all the students flooding his office now, while the economy is imploding within this sector, and people expecting him to ""find them a job.""
* Build these relationships early, ideally in the fall. If you wait until spring, most advisors will be stretched thin with panicked people who waited too long.

  
4. **Query Whether now is the 'Right Time' for Graduate School**

# So you've wanted to go to graduate school for X years and you have that job that you're looking to get out of. Is now the right time to go to school? I'll be blunt, schools are under attack. Their funding availability is questionable and at risk every other day. If you're an international student, I can't even imagine your thoughts about attending U.S. grad school. With all that is going on right now, I can't say it is the ideal environment to go back to school as opposed to maintaining your current gig or looking for a new one while holding on to the current job.

* If you're working in a relevant policy role in an area you want to stay in and debating grad school, consider staying put for now.
* More professional experience will only strengthen your future application, and it spares you from the current job market risk.
* If you absolutely hate your job, maybe considering a job elsewhere first if possible. Again, the same job market principles apply, but being in the inside with networks might help you land something.
* Personally, I’d try to time grad school around the next presidential administration, in hopes that some of these policies are reversed and federal hiring picks back up under either party. I know that is a 3 year wait and might not be possible for some. But if you can do it. I'd consider it. 

# 5. Practical Tips that may Help You

* **Fellowships are gold.** Apply to ***every*** fellowship you’re eligible for: government, private, public interest, foundation-based. These are often more accessible than entry level or lower level jobs that will have people with experience applying. Some fellowships will accept applications up to 2 or 3 years post-graduation. There are ones that are industry specific (science/tech/civil rights/housing/etc.) and there are state, local, gubernatorial, association, agency, all sorts of fellowships. Hell, Google even has a fellowship program in policy. Many of these open their applications in Fall but either way start your timeline search early so you know and don't miss out. 
   * Another quick note, some fellowships have ""rolling deadlines."" They basically say ""eh, we look at these every now and again."" I haven't met a single soul who has gotten one of these fellowships. All my advisors have said to avoid them and that they are normally an inside track for someone they may know and already have in mind. ""Hey, you remember Phil who works X? Lets give him this fellowship."" I'd be happy to know that I am wrong and please share your experience. But they have tended to be vague applications that are the equivalent of a resume parking lot that someone might look at once every 6 months. I haven't even gotten rejection emails from some of these that I've applied to. Its absurd. 
* **LinkedIn actually works.** ***I got more traction there than anywhere else*****.** Follow people who post job openings and look out for job boards. There are SOOOO many job boards that are helpful. These tend to be the most up to date and even better than the actual jobs posted by the LinkedIn algorithm itself. If someone posts “I’m hiring for X,” send them a short direct message with your resume attached. Some people think that’s poor form — I went 5/5 on getting interviews using that strategy. In fact, that is how I landed my current job. I messaged the person within 15 minutes of them posting the job opportunity. They said I looked really qualified and they pulled my application. If you're afraid of doing it, the way I got over that was thinking: some other guy on LinkedIn is doing this, so fuck it. 
* **Be patient but persistent.** The job market isn’t personal. It’s just hard right now. Everyone is struggling, even from top-tier programs and with loads of experience. A colleague of mine was laid off in January and just got a senior level job that meets his needs, and he's one of the most qualified people I know. 
   * The best two pieces of advice I got were ""don't take no's personally"" and ""you just gotta get ONE company/org to say yes."" The first one helped me reframe my pissed offness and depression. The second one gave me hope when I otherwise felt like a failure. You just need to convince ONE company/org that you are the right fit. It makes it feel less daunting and more manageable in my opinion.

**Final Thought**

Harvard Kennedy School usually boasts an 80% placement rate within 9 months of graduation. Based on what I’m hearing across HKS degree programs (MPA, MPA/ID, MPP, MC/MPA, AND dual degrees), I would be genuinely surprised if this year’s rate breaks 50%. That’s not a knock on students or HKS. It’s a reflection of how brutal the job market has become.

Whether you're just starting your graduate school journey or considering whether this is the right time, I hope this post helps you plan more strategically and protect yourself from unnecessary risk. It’s a tough environment,  but it’s not impossible.

Happy to answer questions or help others in this community however I can. 

I invite others to provide feedback to our colleagues within this post too, whether that is pushback on my thoughts and areas you disagree with me (which I won't take personally) or additional pieces of advice/suggestions I may have missed that you would like to contribute. I am also going to comment with some resources that I found helpful in the coming days.",4,1746021148.0,PublicPolicy,0,1.0,False

I want to share my experience with Strattera during my first month. I took Concerta a couple of years ago and quit because of its side effects (Insomnia, basically). My doctor prescribed me Strattera and I had my doubts since I read many bad reviews but I had no choice, I couldn't manage my ADD symptoms anymore without help. So here's my take:

  
1) I was surprised it worked so fast. I read that for some people it could take a month to start feeling the effects but I started feeling the effects an hour after taking it. Immediately felt alert, engaged and my attention was there. 

2) There's no insomnia effect, at least for me. I loved using Concerta but it ruined my sleep so I stuck with coffee after that but I developed resistance to caffeine after a while and I was a mess, mentally. With Strattera I have to problem, and I get a massive crash at about the same time I go to bed, so it's perfect for me. 

3) Orgasms are...weird? I get some intense orgasms, not necessarily pleasurable but almost painful. And sometimes I ejaculate before orgasm, so I need time to be careful not to impregnate my wife. We don't use protection and it has worked out well so far but I might have to start using.

4) I have a short fuse now. For some reason I get angry or snap during situations where I used to be calm. This didn't happen to me on Concerta, will this go away? No, I don't get violent but I react more than before. 

  
So far it has worked well for me, I don't get nauseous when taking it. I usually eat a small snack before taking it and I've felt fine. Just wanted to share with you and if you have any questions for me, go ahead and ask. ",1,1746021074.0,StratteraRx,0,1.0,False

1kbgys1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1kbgys1/modern_nightmare_working_from_home_in_a_studio/,Modern nightmare: working from home in a studio flat,"My partner and I work full time but we can only afford a studio flat on our combined salaries. The problem is I'm self employed and his employer expects him to work from home alone for tasks like focused research - his employer provides him with an office but says he can't work there as he needs his big computer screen at home.

I need to practise and record a presentation involving sensitive information. That means I have to speak out loud, without distracting him, or him distracitng me. I can't do it outside in public on the street as I need no one else around to hear. 

This is a serious problem, because both our livelihoods depend on it. If I can’t record presentations or he can't work on his big screen, we both risk losing income altogether.

I have nowhere else to go:

* I don’t have a car to sit and work from.
* The local park is always full of people, and I need to speak aloud with sensitive info I'm not allowed to let them hear
* Our small patio garden is just 2m x 4m and surrounded by 15 neighbours, all with open windows. There's no privacy.
* Nearby cafes are no good either. They’re busy, and each has only one toilet, so I can’t stay long inside a locked toilet either.

This is a modern problem. Twenty years ago:

* Rents were far cheaper relative to income, so you could afford a flat with actual rooms.
* You didn’t need to record videos for work and it was easy to find somewhere to practise presentations out loud, and easy to find somewhere to work alone (e.g. a room at home)
* Offices used to provide full equipment, like proper screens, not just make you use a laptop
* Parks were less crowded, and coffee shops were often empty... it was so easy to find quiet and privacy. If anything, we were more sociable back then as we had more space to think alone.

Today, to have space to work alone, you need a much higher salary than most jobs provide.. it’s a frustrating thing..  the expectations of today, without the space or income to meet them..

1kbgyq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kbgyq9/the_leftovers/,The Leftovers,"This is something I wrote after a rough morning.  Very personal. I’m not looking for advice, just needed to share it somewhere. If you’ve ever felt quietly pushed out of something that once made you feel seen — this is for you too.

Waking up is always hard. But she has a routine.

Lately, that routine has shifted — she got a puppy, and he wakes up earlier than she’d like. Still, she gets up. Takes him out. Starts the coffee pot, slips on her worn slippers, and steps outside into the quiet morning.

As he sniffs the grass and does his business, she checks her phone — not expecting much, but still hoping. Hoping some of her online friends are awake. Hoping to catch up on the group chat from last night. She always goes to bed before them. They usually don’t mind.

But today, something’s off.

The group chat is gone.

Not just silent — gone.

She closes the app and reopens it, heart starting to pound, trying to calm herself with logic. *Maybe it’s the app. Maybe it glitched.* She searches again. Nothing.

She finds the original invite to the chat, sent by the person who started it — but the “Join” button is greyed out.

She stares at the screen, blinking back tears.

No explanation. No warning. Just... gone.

She picks up her puppy gently and goes back inside.

She locks the door, then refills the dog’s food and water bowls. She lets the water run a little longer than necessary — just to feel it, just to hear something that confirms she’s still *here*, still *real*.

Coffee. Couch. Laptop.

She opens the app again, as if it might magically return.

Still gone.

She replays the last few messages she sent in the group. One was about some old YouTube videos she liked — she’d asked if anyone else had seen them, but no one responded. She had posted a picture of her puppy after someone else shared theirs. Maybe she posted too many? Maybe she was annoying?

The memory of someone once saying, *“Not everyone wants to hear about your puppy all the time,”* echoes in her head.

*Maybe I was too much. Maybe they were talking about kicking me out. Maybe they finally got tired of pretending to like me.*

The thoughts spiral — quiet, sharp, relentless.

She clicks into her profile picture.

There she is, or at least the version she tries to be. Wearing her husband’s Coast Guard t-shirt. Red hair loose. TikTok filters had erased the blemishes, left only freckles. A carefully indifferent expression on her face.

She remembers the effort it took to pretend she didn’t care.

She knows the truth. She’s heavier than that picture shows. Her lips blur into her skin. That photo is a mask — just like everything else. Pretending to be okay. Pretending to belong.

She can’t shake the feeling that she’s always on the verge of being left behind. And usually, eventually, she is.

No matter how many times she reinvents herself, her real self lingers just beneath the surface. Sad. Silent. Still there.

*Hell, if I had the choice,* she thinks, *I wouldn’t even be friends with me.*

She hovers over typing a message to the person who started the group. Maybe it was a mistake. Her mind drifts — *Bob Ross used to say there are no mistakes, just happy accidents.*

She smiles at the memory. Watching Bob Ross with her mom as a kid, her mom painting while his soft voice filled the living room. She loved those moments. Loved watching her mom create something from nothing.

She wishes she could call Heaven. Just for a second.

But that thought is too much. The tears come again. She closes the app.

*It wasn’t a mistake,* she tells herself. *It was a quiet message: You don’t belong. Not anymore.*

She’s 40 now. Most of them were in their 30s. Maybe that made a difference.

She sighs.

Work is waiting — another numb, quiet day. But now, no chat. No memes. No random messages to break up the monotony.

Just silence.

She opens and closes the app one last time.

Then deletes it from her phone.

No use checking something that’s already decided.

The choice wasn’t hers — but moving forward is. Always has been.

One foot in front of the other.

Even if it feels like walking barefoot across broken glass. Even if every step stings, pierces, bleeds.

Stopping isn’t allowed.

Giving up isn’t an option.

One foot. Then the next.

Jeans. Bra. Shirt.

Socks. Shoes.

Tears blinked away. Breath held.

The day begins — boring, maybe. Empty, definitely.

But at least it’s real.

1kbgsy6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbgsy6,"It's peak dandelion season in NJ - made some root ""coffee"" and a salad","Got a great crop of dandelion plants going in my yard right now. And since dandelion is 100% edible from flowers down to roots, I thought I'd harvest early in the season and build up my ""coffee"" stock and make a few salads before the greens get too bitter. 

I used a weed puller tool to get large section of the roots extracted without having to dig with a trowel. This also minimizes the size of the hole left from pulling the plant out. I always put all the disturbed soil back to keep from leaving obvious holes in my lawn. Here's the tool I use: [https://amzn.to/42YCtoR](https://amzn.to/42YCtoR) (affiliate link), but there are many options. 

I collect usually 20-30 root sections per ""harvest"", depending on how large the pieces are. Then I soak them in water and give them a quick spay to get the residual sand/dirt separated. I also usually lightly scrub with mushroom-type brush to remove the last bits of organic matter from the outside, but this isn't really necessary. Then I chop the roots into smaller pieces and put them on a baking sheet in the oven at 350F for about 20 minutes. Then I put the dried root pieces in a spice/coffee grinder and break it down to a moderately fine consistency. 

I use 1 - 1.5 TSP in a 12oz cup of hot water for a nice tea with a bitter finish. It's not coffee by a long shot, but the bitter finish and roasted earthy notes might scratch the coffee itch for some people. I like it with a little honey or stevia to balance out the bitter. 

I also saved some greens to go in a salad. I use dandelion for about 15-25% of the total greens in a salad, and I've never had one that was too bitter at those mix levels. Younger plants taste like arugula, while the older plants get much more bitter. 

Next: I'm going to try to  make fritters from the flowers. I've heard it's pretty good.

Earnings miss, customer drop-offs, and China headwinds spark steep sell-off — can Niccol's turnaround plan caffeinate the stock?

https://preview.redd.it/y322lr4c5zxe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=db741c0e5c369044faea350f2cc08f6b21b804f7

Starbucks just delivered a bitter brew to Wall Street.

Shares of the global coffee giant tumbled as much as 9% in premarket trading following a second-quarter earnings miss that rattled investor confidence and cast serious doubt over CEO Brian Niccol’s much-hyped turnaround plan. The report wasn't just underwhelming — it revealed fundamental cracks in Starbucks’ U.S. operations and ongoing uncertainty in its key international market, China.

Same-store sales in the U.S. fell for the fifth straight quarter, down 2%, as budget-conscious consumers increasingly opted for cheaper alternatives. While Wall Street had expected a slight dip of 0.3%, the steeper decline underscored the growing pressure Starbucks is facing from competitors like McDonald’s and Dunkin’. Customers are visiting less frequently — transactions slid 4% year-over-year — though those who did stop by spent more, with average ticket size up 3%. It’s a trend that suggests the loyalists are holding on, but casual coffee drinkers are drifting elsewhere.

The financial pain was just as evident in the company’s topline numbers. Starbucks posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, well below analysts’ expectations of $0.49. Revenue also missed, coming in at $8.76 billion instead of the $8.83 billion forecast. But perhaps the most alarming data point? A 50% drop in quarterly profit year-over-year, plunging to $384 million. That’s not just a miss — it’s a warning flare.

Margins, too, took a hit. The company’s adjusted operating margin came in at 8.2%, shy of the 9.5% anticipated by analysts. That means Starbucks is making less money per dollar of sales than many expected — a red flag for a company that has long prided itself on operational efficiency and pricing power.

CEO Brian Niccol, who took the helm last fall after his high-profile jump from Chipotle, didn’t sugarcoat the numbers. “Our Q2 results are disappointing,” he said on the earnings call. But he was quick to defend the broader vision. “Behind the scenes, we made a lot of progress and have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan.” That plan includes streamlining the menu, speeding up service, and refocusing on core coffee offerings — essentially getting back to basics after years of trying to be everything to everyone.

Yet, Wall Street isn’t buying into the optimism — not yet, anyway. The reality is that Starbucks' U.S. business, once its golden goose, is facing a serious identity crisis. And with consumer sentiment dampened by inflation, layoffs, and geopolitical anxiety, convincing Americans to splurge on a $6 latte has become a taller order than ever.

Then there’s China — the market that was supposed to be Starbucks’ next engine of growth. While the company managed to stop the bleeding in Q2, results there were still flat. Transactions were up 4%, but that gain was wiped out by a 4% drop in average ticket size. In other words, more people are coming into stores, but they’re spending less. Analysts had braced for worse — expecting a decline of more than 2% — but “less bad” isn’t quite the same as “good.”

Complicating matters further is the geopolitical backdrop. With former President Trump back in the headlines, his proposed 145% ""reciprocal"" tariff on Chinese goods has shaken global markets and could have knock-on effects for Starbucks' already fragile brand image in China. Anti-American sentiment has flared in recent months, and for a company with nearly 20% of its global stores based in China, that’s no small threat.

Niccol remains upbeat, at least publicly. “We remain committed to China for the long term,” he said, noting that the company is experimenting with new flavors and doubling down on marketing to reignite consumer enthusiasm. But as he also acknowledged, turning around a giant like Starbucks is no quick fix.

Back in the U.S., challenges are compounding. The company laid off more than 1,000 employees in February and has reversed some of its more progressive policies, including an open-door stance toward non-customers in cafes. That move, once lauded for inclusivity, has been dialed back in favor of a focus on efficiency and order.

Labor tensions are also bubbling. Starbucks’ ongoing standoff with its unionized workers hit a fresh snag last week when employees rejected the company’s latest contract offer. Since the first unionization vote in Buffalo back in 2021, labor organizing has gained momentum — and Starbucks' handling of the issue has drawn both praise and criticism, depending on which side of the picket line you stand.

Despite all this, Niccol insists Starbucks is still on the right track. He says his optimism has matured into confidence, pointing to what he calls “real momentum” behind the scenes. But the markets are in no mood for promises. They want results — and they want them fast.

Starbucks shares have dropped roughly 4% over the past year, a poor showing compared to the S&P 500’s 8.7% rise. And while the company did beat expectations last quarter, thanks to what Niccol then called a “low bar,” it’s clear that the goodwill has now evaporated.

The bottom line? Starbucks is in a defining moment. The brand remains iconic, its global footprint unmatched, and its customer loyalty program still one of the best in retail. But those assets won’t matter if the company can’t execute on its turnaround. Wall Street has seen the pitch — now it’s waiting for delivery.

Niccol’s next few quarters will determine more than just Starbucks' stock trajectory. They could define his legacy as CEO.

**Conclusion**

Starbucks’ latest earnings report wasn’t just a hiccup — it was a red flag that the road to recovery may be longer and steeper than anticipated. Brian Niccol’s turnaround strategy is bold, but it’s running headfirst into economic headwinds, rising competition, internal labor strife, and geopolitical uncertainty. With disappointing earnings, falling traffic, flat sales in China, and a shaken investor base, Starbucks must now prove that its “Back to Starbucks” plan is more than just branding. For investors and customers alike, the next few quarters will be critical. Will Starbucks rekindle its former glory, or is the brand’s halo fading under the weight of changing tastes and tougher times?",2,1746019829.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

I woke up this morning exhausted, but fine, until I used the bathroom after coffee and my chest got super tight. It’s been tight all morning. I told myself if I go to the gym and I’m fine, then it’s not a heart attack and it’s just left over anxiety and exhaustion. I wanted to cry on the way there bc I’m so frustrated by how I’m feeling. I just finished the gym and the tightness is still there. I’m fighting everything in me not to go to the er.

1kbgehl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbgehl,"Breakfasts - Pennsylvania USA, 7/10","Good morning 🙂

If you read my last post, I am postpartum after a surprise and fairly traumatic cesarean on Monday. My baby boy is still in the NICU, and it has been hard on momma emotionally while also physically recovering from unexpected surgery. 

All that to say, I’ve been a scroll-rat on this sub for ages, I always look at everyone’s meals 😂 and I told myself I’d give you guys each of mine while here. However, I’ve been slacking a bit 😬 

Let’s get into a recap though! 

Monday: went in to AM appointment at OB on an empty stomach not expecting anything new, sent over to hospital, in surgery by afternoon, first meal wasn’t until 2am Tuesday and it was doordash >!(chicken tenders + fries from Chickie & Pete’s … the best thing EVER in the moment and felt like heaven)!<

Tuesday: No sleep, at kitchen opening I got my first hospital meal shown. 

photo 1: scrambled eggs, bacon, english muffin, breakfast potatoes. Fruit & cheese plate. 6/10 - fruit & cheese plate was picked at, bacon was consumed, had a few potatoes. Was really down emotionally and honestly struggled to enjoy this meal. Eggs gave me the major ick so decided not to try them again

I also ordered lunch, didn’t eat or photograph, had a really rough afternoon emotionally again 

Slept through dinner ordering cut off, went to visit baby in NICU for awhile. He latched on to my breast, (!!) and was showing a lot of progress in his health. Finally worked up an appetite and ordered Doordash again around midnight lol >!Chickie and Pete’s caught me again 😂 I think it was just so comforting the night before. This time a cheesesteak and fries, that I went crazy on,!< then I passed out and got the first solid chunk of sleep since being here

Wednesday(today): Woke up finally rested. Showered. Feeling a bit more optimistic today.  (Translation: less like a dirty depressed gremlin) Ordered breakfast ..

photo 2:  Bacon, potatoes, rice krispies. Fruit & cheese plate, no swiss. Hot coffee that I turned into iced. 8/10 - potatoes were undercooked today compared to yesterday so I ate less. Bacon was yummy. Cereal always good. I ate all the cheddar cheese cubes and grapes but the strawberries were yucky today. Overall, a decent meal for a hospital - or maybe I’m just feeling happier 🙂 


Will try and remember lunch and dinner pics today .. if you read it all - thank you 🩵

I started using and learning my new machine with double shots, but then realized they were too damn strong for me. I then decided to try the single basked and saw lots of negative discussion on them. Nevertheless, I gave it a go with the following specs:

* BDB (Breville Dual Boiler) stock single basket.
* DF54 grinder grind size 14 (one grind size finer than a double shot)
* Dark roasted beans (Rast Milano). [Milano | Buy coffee online at Rast Kaffee](https://www.rastshop.ch/de/kaffee/milano)
* A firm but lighter tamp vs the double basket. One seems to be enough.

This converts 9.5g powder to 19g espresso in 27 seconds. The single shots certainly don't look as beautiful with a bottomless filter while extracting as the double shots do, and it lacks the same depth, but they still taste good and do not blow my head off like the double shots did, which means I can enjoy coffee more frequently during the day up to my 3pm cutoff point.

I think I will stick with single shots for neat espresso and double shots for milk drinks.

We are a small coffee shop, very low volume, but have a lot of floor space. We have been working with local crafts to sell their items on consignment. One our our baristas also does crafts and has been selling them there for about 4 months. Although she originally asked if she could bring them in to sell the same as the others (we take 30%) we have not charged her anything, nor has she inquired about paying us. 

In our minds, even though we could eventually fill all of our space, we aren't currently, so we have viewed it almost as an employee perk of sorts and not a money maker for us.

I guess recently a couple of her items (valued at $10 each, air fresheners) went missing but she never told us. Today, she said two more went missing yesterday afternoon after she left. We are very small volume, maybe 50 customers a day during the week, so small window of opportunity for theft and we are reviewing the cameras. However, she told us, not asked, that if they don't turn up today she is going to take their cost out of the store.

In my mind, we pay for missing product of other people because we inventory it ourselves, ring it in our point of sale, take a commission, and then payout. With hers we do not inventory it, she does, we do not collect payment, she has a QR code and a cash envelope, and we do not take a payment (we would have taken over a couple hundred dollars by now, if we took commission off her). So for her to not just ask but dictate that she is taking money from us for the missing items, it honestly has me a little upset.

Would I be wrong to tell her that, moving forward, if we are going to be responsible for her shrinkage, that we have to sign her up like everyone else and start taking a percentage?",3,1746019145.0,barista,4,1.0,False

1kbg6ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kbg6ot/does_waterdrop_tsu_under_sink_water_filter_system/,Does Waterdrop TSU Under Sink Water Filter System Deliver? Detailed Review,"Having used the Waterdrop TSU 0.01μm Ultra-Filtration Under Sink Water Filter System and TSPP Sediment Water Filter for the past few months, I’ve developed a strong understanding of its performance, functionality, and practicality. As someone who values clean and safe drinking water, this system has been put through its paces in my home, and I’m here to share my honest experience with it.

**Design and Build**  
One of the first things I noticed after unboxing this under-sink water filter was its sleek and compact tankless design. It saves tons of space under my sink, which is great for someone like me who has five different cleaning supplies crammed into that area. The minimalistic approach, combined with a white and gray color scheme, means it blends seamlessly in nearly any kitchen style. The faucet included in the box also carries the same clean look, elevating the overall aesthetic of my sink area. However, I confess that installing the faucet required some effort as I’m someone who struggles with basic plumbing tasks.

**Ease of Installation and Use**  
If you’re worried about setting this up, don’t be. With no requirement for additional tools, the single-twist installation of replacement filters makes it ridiculously easy. Honestly, I’ve had far more challenging times trying to assemble Ikea furniture than I did installing this filter. I switched out the filters within seconds, and the included instructions were clear even to someone unskilled in DIY setups. No electric wiring is required, which I found incredibly relieving because I live in constant fear of accidentally electrifying myself.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact tankless design, saving space under the sink.  
- No electricity or wastewater during operation.  
- Easy twist-in replacement system for filters.  
- Uses a 3-stage ultra-filtration process.  
- Reduces sediment, sand, rust, and other impurities effectively.

**Drawbacks**  
- It filters water fast, but the flow rate might feel a touch slower than your standard unfiltered tap water.  
- Included faucet design, while modern, might not satisfy someone seeking premium finishes.

**Performance and Water Quality**  
The 3-stage filtration system, which includes an advanced PP membrane in the pre-sediment filter, has delivered impressively clean and clear water. I noticed a significant difference in the taste of the water almost immediately. It’s crisp, fresh, and makes everything from coffee to cooking seem better. Having tested the sedimentation purifying process, I was particularly impressed by how efficiently it reduced visible impurities. For someone who lives in an area prone to hard water issues, this component alone has been a game changer. However, it’s worth pointing out that you’ll still need separate solutions for issues like salt or heavy iron – this system isn’t a one-size-fits-all.

**Routine Maintenance**  
The replacement cycle for the filters is straightforward. With roughly six months of service per filter, I feel it balances convenience and affordability. I haven’t run into any clogging issues, but I can see this happening if one forgets to replace the filters regularly. Thankfully, the smart panel makes keeping track of filter life almost too easy.

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this system to competitors such as the Brita Total360 or APEC ROES-50, you can immediately see distinctions in terms of structure and functionality. Unlike many reverse osmosis systems that utilize tanks and generate considerable water waste, this ultra-filtration device operates efficiently with no wastewater. That feature alone sets it apart for eco-conscious users. However, reverse osmosis systems often provide a broader purification spectrum, targeting more contaminants. Decide on your priorities – tankless eco-friendliness or multi-contaminant removal – to figure out which best suits your kitchen.

**Financial Value**  
In terms of its price-performance ratio, this is by far one of the smartest investments I’ve made in household utilities. While avoiding direct pricing (because numbers fluctuate like crazy these days), I can confidently say that it feels like quality craftsmanship given its durable filters and stellar purification results. Considering how much bottled water I no longer need to buy, it practically pays for itself over a few months. Those interested in a balance of affordability and features should find it worth exploring.

Received the good news last Sunday, submitted the report on Saturday so didn't expect it at all!   
Would like to share how I did it!

Little background information, graduated as developer back in 2019, since then worked as IT helpdesk employee for a couple of companies (Couldn't get a job as developer), eventually landing a administrator role and currently a system administrator role with focus on security.

Whilst building my career as admin I've always looked at cyber security and especially offensive security. Since 2021 I've been active on HackTheBox and a little bit of TryHackMe but mainly HTB. Always done active machines and bought VIP back in 2023 to be able to do retired machines with guides. Did them whenever I had time but didn't really focus on it until beginning of 2023. Then I started focusing on easy-medium and sometimes hard machines, had to use a lot of guides, always tried myself first for a couple of hours and then looked at the guide for the next step, trying myself again and so on.

This year I wanted to get the OSCP certification. Got access to the PEN-200 environment in January and started studying the material, whilst doing the studies I immediately completed the capstone labs associated with the study material. I tried to study everyday, did the capstone labs and after completing the material (up until AWS) I moved onto the challenges in the PEN-200 environment. Did all the challenges except Skylark. Whilst doing the challenges I always treated them as if it was the OSCP exam, take proper notes, screenshots of every action taken, make a overview, attack path and ways to fix the found vulnerabilities. For two of the challenges, Relia & Medtech I made an actual full report for training purposes. I believe this helped a lot with the actual report because this way I knew my weaknesses with making a report and where I had to improve.

Next to the OffSec challenges I also kept active on HTB whenever possible, around the beginning of April I had done all the challenges and stand- alone challenges in the PEN-200 environment so tried to keep up my skills with HTB.

Got access in the beginning of January and planned the exam on Apr 24 12:00.

Exam day:

Had a good night sleep, proper lunch before, cooked a big pot the day before, and took a 20 minute walk in the morning to clear my mind.

The exam itself was gruesome but rewarding. Focused on the Active Directory set first, obtained Domain Administrator within 2 hours!! Then onto the stand- alone machines..... for 7 hours nothing. I kept switching between machines because I couldn't find a entry point, eventually I found it and realized I made a crucial mistake, which could have been avoided had I not been stressing so much. It was around 21:00, and had user on one machine and domain admin, totaling 50 points. Not enough to pass. So I set my eyes on the stand-alone machine I managed to get into as user to get Admin / Root. Tried the whole night but didn't manage to do it. At around 01:30 I went to bed, stressing, over-thinking, contemplating whether or not I am making a mistake sleeping, but eventually around 02:00 managed to fall asleep. Possible one of the worst sleeps I've had in a long while.

06:00, alarm went off, made some breakfast, coffee, and sat down at my desk. Told the examiner I was ready to go again. So I redid everything, treating as If i just saw the machines for the first time. Service enumeration, back-to-basics. After a hour of trying I managed to find the entry point, and got user privileges on the machine, +10 points. Half-an hour later, root! +10 points. totaling 70 points, enough to pass. I've let out the biggest sigh of my life and went to the next machine. It was around 10:30, still a lot of time left.  Managed to also get user- privileges on the last stand-alone machine half an hour later, +10 points, 80 in the pocket.

Tried to get admin for about another 10-15 minutes, had around 30 minutes access left, but wanted to make sure I had all the screenshots so I stopped trying to do privilege escalation and went back to my notes, reading all the machines through and checking if I had all the necessary screenshots. 11:45 comes around, and access lost. Felt like a little brick fell off my shoulders, I knew it cannot go wrong now, but still  the report had to be finished within 24 hours.

Writing the report was a lot less stressful and actually pretty fun. Managed to get it fully done the next day around 10:00, so with around a couple of hours to spare. I just the template supplied by OffSec. 

In the end I realized I made some crucial mistakes, which you always see listed here:

* \- Enumeration, enumeration, enumeration.
   * Key to everything, did you look at everything? **EVERYTHING?**
* \- Notes
   * Did you write everything you found down? Have you seen X before somewhere else?
* \- Time management
   * Make sure to take breaks, every couple hours, take a small walk or just look away from the screen for a bit. Every 2 hours i tried walking around the apartment or outside.
* \- Its a marathon, not a sprint
   * Even though it's only 24 hours, don't go in overdrive. You have enough time, take it (somewhat) easy and think about the basics.
* \- Don't rely on one tool
   * I realized way too late that the mistakes I made or entry points I didn't see were easily discovered by other tools. Use multiple tools if you have a feeling there should be something more or if you're stuck at a certain point. 

Down below I've listed some valuable notes, tools, and other information that really helped me during the studies / exam. 

* [NetSec Focus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview)

* Create a easy to follow, clear, structured notes layout. 
   * I personally use Obsidian, and made folders for specific parts such as 
      * Windows -> Enumeration, Privilege Escalation, Post- Exploitation, Exploits, General Notes
      * Linux -> Enumeration, Privilege Escalation, Post- Exploitation, Exploits, General Notes
      * Web -> Enumeration, Privilege Escalation, Post- Exploitation, Exploits, General Notes
      * Active Directory -> Enumeration, Privilege Escalation, Post- Exploitation, Exploits, General Notes
* HackTheBox retired machines; focus on Active Directory, Linux, Web apps and Vulnerabilities. 
* Try not to rely on Metasploit; During the studies I tried to avoid using Metasploit all together, since it is restricted during the exam. Luckily I didn't have to fall back to Metasploit during the exam.
* Tools:
   * [https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng) (Ligolo-ng for tunneling)

1kbfxih,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kbfxih/what_makes_soundcore_space_a40_earbuds_stand_out/,What Makes Soundcore Space A40 Earbuds Stand Out? In-Depth Review Inside!,"The **Soundcore A3936 Space A40** adaptive active noise-cancelling wireless earbuds promise a blend of premium features and robust performance. I’ve spent weeks using these earbuds in various settings—during my morning commutes, marathon work calls, and even sweaty gym sessions—and here’s my take on how they stood up to everyday life, both the good and the not-so-good.

**Smart Design and Comfort**

What immediately impressed me about this product was its lightweight build. These earbuds are, quite literally, so light that I sometimes forgot I was wearing them. Their ergonomic design ensures a snug, comfortable fit, and for someone with oddly shaped ears (like me), this was a game-changer. You get five interchangeable ear tip sizes in the box, so it’s easy to customize your fit.

However, the carrying case, while compact, feels just a tad flimsy. It’s not something I’d want to drop on hard pavement. That being said, the understated white finish of both the case and earbuds lends them a refined look, perfect for users who care about aesthetics without shouting ""flashy.""

**Sound Quality: Deep Bass and Crisp Highs**

Let me just say this upfront: the sound quality here is insane for earbuds in this price range. Utilizing double-layer diaphragm drivers, these earbuds deliver solid bass, clear mids, and bright trebles. Watching high-action movies and pumping up high-energy workout playlists was genuinely satisfying. On top of that, switching to LDAC mode for Hi-Res Audio Wireless was like cherry-picking every single detail in my favorite tracks.

Though the soundstage is impressive for most genres, I felt it slightly falters with classical music or audiobooks—those who lean towards those might notice a bit of flatness in instrumental layering.

**Key Benefits**
- **Customized Comfort**: Multiple ear tip sizes ensure a great fit for all ear shapes.
- **Hi-Res Audio Wireless**: Immersive listening experience, especially in LDAC mode.
- **Compact Build**: Great portability and comfortable for extended use.
- **Exceptional Noise Isolation**: Blocks up to 98% of unwanted noise like a champ.

[Check Soundcore A3936 Space A40 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0bltztdkv/)

**Noise-Cancelling Performance**

Honestly, this is where these earbuds shine brightest. The Space A40 boasts a noise-cancelling system capable of reducing surrounding noise by up to 98%. I tested them in noisy subway cars, crowded coffee shops, and even next to a construction site. While no earbuds truly eliminate 100% of external noise, these did an excellent job at muffling distractions. They even adjust automatically, tailoring noise-cancellation levels based on the environment—a nifty feature that worked seamlessly in real-time.

But here's a downside worth mentioning: windy conditions can throw off the calibration momentarily, leading to uneven audio isolation. It’s not a dealbreaker, but something to consider.

**Battery Life for the Long Haul**

The product proudly advertises a total battery life of 50 hours (10 on the earbuds and 40 from the case)—and I think they undersold themselves. These little things just last. I could go an entire workweek with a mix of active and standby usage without needing a recharge. In a pinch, just 10 minutes of fast charging granted me up to four hours of playback, a lifesaver during my ""oops, I forgot to charge them"" moments.

The only question mark, really, is how long this rechargeable battery will maintain its longevity under heavy use over the years.

**Downsides**
- **Unreliable in Wind**: Noise-cancellation struggles in highly windy scenarios.
- **Durability Concerns**: The carrying case feels less sturdy than competitors’.
- **Layered Audio Gap**: Small inconsistencies in complex instrumental pieces.

**Product Competitors**

I’d compare these earbuds directly with brands like the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Apple AirPods Pro. Sony edges ahead with slightly more advanced noise-cancellation, but their larger size may not suit everyone. AirPods Pro notably provide seamless connectivity for iPhone users, though they lack the battery life provided by the A40. What these earbuds win on is price-to-features. They are budget-friendly without skimming on premium offerings like LDAC mode, which isn’t universally available across competitors.

**Bang for the Buck**

The value proposition is undeniable here. Even as a renewed product, these earbuds deliver on so many counts. While you might not get the absolute luxury build of some high-end rivals, you’re still enjoying features like adaptive active noise cancellation, Hi-Res sound, and wireless charging at a fraction of their price. Personally, I’d say you’re not compromising too much by opting for this model. It’s especially ideal for users looking for sophisticated performance without breaking the bank.

1kbfx4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1kbfx4o/how_to_effectively_manage_time_as_an_entrepreneur/,How to Effectively Manage Time as an Entrepreneur,"Let’s dive into the wonderful world of time management, shall we? If you've ever felt like you're swimming in a sea of to-do lists, calendars, and a steady stream of notifications, you're not alone. We’ve all been there—looking at the clock as if it just mocked us for the millionth time. But fear not, my fellow time traveler! I’ve got some strategies that can help you regain control of your day and maybe even squeeze in a little laughter too. 

First up, let’s talk about the **Eisenhower Matrix**. Picture Dwight Eisenhower—yes, the former president and general, not your quirky coworker with an obsession for staplers—who famously said, “What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.” This matrix is all about sorting tasks into four quadrants:

1. **Quadrant 1**: Urgent and important. These are the fire drills of life—handle them first, and don’t forget to breathe between the chaos.
   
2. **Quadrant 2**: Important but not urgent. This is where the magic happens. Dive deep into those tasks that will contribute to your long-term goals. They’re the soul food of your schedule! 

3. **Quadrant 3**: Urgent but not important. These tasks can often be distractions—like that craving for a snack during a Netflix binge. Evaluate whether someone else can handle these tasks. Delegate and enjoy your snack guilt-free!

4. **Quadrant 4**: Neither urgent nor important. If you find yourself in this quadrant, it's time to take a step back and really assess your priorities. Maybe Netflix does need a break after all.

Next, let’s jump into the **Pomodoro Technique**—and no, it’s not an excuse to have tomato sauce for lunch. It’s a fun little method that encourages focus and productivity through short bursts of work. Here’s the scoop:

1. **Choose a task** you need to tackle. This could be anything from brainstorming your next great idea to finally organizing those photos from last summer's trip that are populated with awkward selfies.

2. **Set a timer for 25 minutes** and get to work! This is your ""Pomodoro session"" (again, no sauce needed). Dive in, eliminate distractions, and get at it. It’s like sweet meditation, but with a purpose.

3. When the timer goes off, take a **5-minute break**. Stretch, grab a snack, check social media, or just stare at the ceiling. I won’t judge.

4. After four sessions, treat yourself to a longer break of 15-30 minutes. You can even do some cartwheels if that’s your thing (just watch out for that low ceiling fan).

And let’s not forget the fantastic spice of community in all this. Sometimes, sharing your goals with friends can bring out the accountability in ways that make it easier to stay on track. Think of it as a support group for your ambitions—like AA for overachievers, but with less coffee and more optimism.

At the end of the day, remember that you’re not alone on this journey. Whether it’s through using these tools or leaning on your community, you can find a rhythm that feels right and allows you to say “yes” to God’s plan for your time. Because while we may plan, it’s often His plans that take the front row. So, get out there, embrace the chaos, and trust that you’re walking a meaningful path. Every minute counts, and so do you.",1,1746018122.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1kbfwf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1kbfwf8/razer_blade_15_2019_running_excessive_system/,Razer Blade 15 (2019) Running Excessive System DPC/ACPI Spikes & Thermal Throttling on Windows 11,"I first noticed something was seriously wrong when, out of nowhere, my brand-new Windows 11 install started devouring 30–40 percent of my CPU just sitting idle, and my battery, once reliable for 5 hours, was now draining in under 2. My Razer Blade 15 (2019) was running so hot that even maxing out the fans through Razer Cortex barely kept the thermals in check, and LatencyMon was screaming about DPC routines in dxgkrnl.sys (the DirectX Graphics Kernel) and ACPI.sys (the power-management driver) executing for far too long.

# My Initial Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Checked for Missing Drivers & Firmware**
   * Installed Intel® Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (DPTF) from Panasonic’s site (my machine refused Intel’s generic package) and rebooted.
   * Ran the Intel Driver & Support Assistant to grab the latest chipset INF, graphics, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth drivers.
   * Tried to update the Intel Management Engine Interface (MEI) via both Device Manager and `pnputil`/`expand`, but every attempt failed with “system cannot find the file specified.”
2. **Disabled Potential Culprits**
   * Disabled all non-Microsoft services via `msconfig`, rebooted, and ran a clean boot.
   * Turned off Windows features like Virtual Machine Platform, Hypervisor Platform, Memory Integrity, and SMB 1.0/CIFS (just in case).
   * Verified driver integrity with `verifier /reset`, then selectively re-enabled only Microsoft-signed drivers.
3. **Tried Power-Management Tweaks**
   * Switched from Windows’ Balanced power plan to a custom scheme with maximum CPU performance and no CPU parking.
   * Dug into advanced power settings—turned off Link State Power Management, set processor minimum and maximum states both to 100 percent, disabled adaptive and turbo boost thresholds.
4. **Reinstalled Windows**
   * After nothing else worked, I backed up my master’s thesis and critical files, then used Windows’ “Reset This PC” (keep files) feature to do a clean install.
   * Applied all the same BIOS-level and Windows tweaks from scratch, hoping to clear out any residual driver conflicts or firmware quirks.

# How It’s Evolved Over Time

* **Day 1**: “System” CPU at **30–40 percent**, constant DPC spikes in `dxgkrnl.sys` up to **3 ms**, ACPI.sys in the red, fans screaming. Battery gave me less than 2 hours.
* **Day 2**: After installing DPTF and chipset INF, “System” CPU dipped to **13–15 percent** idle, temps still high (cores touching **85–90 °C**). Battery life marginally improved but still far below spec.
* **Day 3**: Post-Windows reinstall, idle CPU hovered at **12–16 percent**, thermals a little cooler but still too hot for comfort. LatencyMon now also flagged NT Kernel/System (`ntoskrnl.exe`) ISR wakeups—my DPC picture was getting more complicated, not simpler.
* **Day 4**: Attempted MEI driver update via Microsoft Update Catalog. Extracted `.cab` manually, pointed Device Manager at it—“system cannot find the file specified.” I must have the wrong INF. MEI remains unresolved, so ACPI throttle events persist.
* **Today**: I set PL1/PL2 to their highest BIOS values (disabling the long-term and short-term power limits)—hoping to reduce the “throttle oscillation” contributing to DPC/ISR churn. Now waiting to see if my CPU stays at a stable turbo frequency or just burns hotter.

# Symptoms I’m Still Fighting

* **Excessive “System” CPU Usage**: Idle CPU still double-digit (10–15 percent) when it should be single-digit.
* **Persistent DPC/ISR Spikes**: LatencyMon shows dxgkrnl.sys, ACPI.sys, and occasionally `Wdf01000.sys` spiking. Real-time audio or streaming stutters continue.
* **Over-Aggressive Thermal Throttling**: Despite max fan speeds, core temps flirt with **90–100 °C** under light load; the laptop is uncomfortably hot to touch.
* **Battery Drain**: Even balanced power mode and energy-saver tweaks only eke out 2½ hours of real-world use.

# What I’ve Eliminated

* **Third-Party Software Conflicts**: Clean boots, safe-mode tests, and disabling everything non-Microsoft left the issue unchanged.
* **Corrupt Windows Image**: Multiple reinstalls—first via ISO upgrade, then via “Reset This PC”—produced the same behavior.
* **Driver Version Mismatches**: Installed the latest Intel Graphics DCH driver, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth packages, and INF utility. Nvidia drivers on the dGPU are up-to-date.
* **Memory Integrity / Virtualization Conflicts**: Windows Security’s Core Isolation off, Hyper-V and VM Platform features disabled.

# What I Haven’t Yet Tried (Open Questions)

1. **Proper Intel MEI Driver**
   * I need an exact INF that matches my Razer Blade’s MEI hardware ID—catalog searches overwhelm with generic “2452.x” and “2433.x” servicing entries. I’m not sure which is correct for Windows 11 24H2 on a Coffee Lake H platform.
2. **Firmware Flash**
   * Razer’s site only offers Intel ME firmware updaters (v14 & v12), but no signed Windows MEI driver bundle. Could flashing the ME firmware help the OS-level interface?
3. **BIOS Update**
   * My BIOS is still at v1.05 (2019-09-19). There is a Razer BIOS v1.07 or v1.09 on their support site—would updating that smooth out ACPI handoffs?
4. **Thermal Paste / Hardware Service**
   * Five years of lap-to-lap use might have degraded thermal interface material. Re-pasting could lower core temps by **5–10 °C**, but I’d prefer to exhaust every software/firmware angle first.
5. **Razer-Specific Driver Package**
   * Razer Synapse 4 only controls RGB now; “Razer Blade Intel Firmware Updater” packages may inject custom MEI drivers that match the hardware. I haven’t tested those proprietary updaters.

# Where I’m Stuck

I’m up against a tangle of power-management firmware (MEI, ACPI, DPTF), graphics kernel interrupts, and BIOS limits that Windows interprets as too many DPC/ISR events. Every driver I try to update either refuses to install or seems to make only marginal gains. My blade remains hot, loud, and under-performant in typical light workloads—and constantly drains its battery even if I simply browse and type.

**If you’ve ever untangled a persistent System/ACPI/DirectX DPC storm on a Coffee Lake-H laptop**, I’d love your guidance:

* Which exact MEI driver package (Vendor/Catalog–specific) actually matches the Blade 15 RZ09-0301x on Win 11 24H2?
* Has anyone successfully used Razer’s Intel ME firmware updaters to then install a matching OS driver?
* Would flashing the latest BIOS resolve the ACPI notifications that trigger spiking DPCs?
* Any unconventional registry tweaks or Intel MEBx commands I could try to force PL1/PL2 handoff stability?

I’m desperate at this point, Any insights, download links, or success stories you can share would be tremendously appreciated. Thank you!",4,1746018074.0,razer,3,1.0,False

It still drives like a dream, and I honestly have come to love both the adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist on the endless miles of highway through most of the country. Android Auto worked as advertised, and aside from some truly terrible transcription and a little bit of delay, the reading of texts and voice commands to reply worked pretty well too.

Some superlatives:
- The best stretch of road _by far_ along the way was [NC 19E/194 to Boone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Highway_194).
- The best coffee, conveniently at the end of the fun part of that road, was [Hatchet Coffee in Boone](https://hatchetcoffee.com/).
- The best food was [Potchke in Knoxville](https://www.potchkedeli.com/) (with a notable runner-up being [Elvie's in Jackson](https://www.elviesrestaurant.com/)).
- The best rest stop, though it was an absolute shitshow and I wish I had had more time to take it in and experience it (like much of the rest of the country between Dallas and DC), was the [Buc-ees in Sevierville](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pudu4/i_visited_the_largest_gas_station_in_the_world/).",24,1746017652.0,GRCorolla,5,1.0,False

⚠️ Satire & Speculation Ahead

Grocery Store Nontent: Kylea allegedly purchased the hushpuppies & splash refresher beverage but passed on the zevia soda, plates, and tumblers. 

$399 End Table: The Sol Nightstand from Furniture Row was more important than paying their medical debt. Her god must have answered that prayer quickly since she only buys loves, not likes, and prays about these types of decisions. 

Chili: Speaking of prayer, her god took away her allergy to chili. Poof. Gone.  She can eat big 'ol bowls of the stuff and no longer have issues. 

Soda & Takeout Blended Coffees: This addiction is going strong. Have you noticed she no longer shows the stocked mini fridge? Her pantry must be bursting with soda.

Gym Content: Gym BRO Joe skip a day?  He was looking thick around the waist in his photos.  Why didn't Kylea use her walking pad since it was raining?  What a waste of money.  Maybe it got returned like the ""outfit of the day"" mirror...

Birdie Mae: Where to begin? Kylea and Joe have been @$$holes for weeks arguing, deflecting and projecting on the monetized page, support group and in comments about Birdie's spay surgery. These money hungry pet owners monetized the alleged surgery yesterday in a series of posts.  Just because their dog was pictured in a striped recovery suit (aka surgery suit) it still does not prove she was spayed.  Tigers don't change their stripes and these two love a good grift.

Hey there! I'm 29 and from Brazil. I’m a serious and goal-driven guy, but I’m also someone who laughs easily and loves meaningful conversations. I might be a bit clumsy with words sometimes, but I always speak from the heart.

I really value honest, close connectionswhen I bond with someone, I’m very loyal and committed. I’m hoping to meet a woman who shares that same mindset and is ready to build something real and lasting.

I’m a nerd by nature. I love tech, science fiction, space, time travel, and all those “what if” kind of topics. Shows like *Dark Matter*, *Star Trek*, *The Expanse*, *Stargate*, Silo, *Farscape*, and *Foundation* really spark my imagination. I used to game and watch anime a lot, and those interests still stick with me.

I live a pretty simple life. I work freelance, I study, and I’m always trying to grow and improve. I enjoy science and tech videos and music that really moves the soul. I’m a romantic too when there’s mutual energy and respect, I care deeply.

Lifestyle-wise: I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I like calm vibes, fruit juice, and tea (coffee lovers feel free to keep it all to yourselves ). I’m not religious, but I respect all beliefs. I lean a bit conservative on some views and really value emotional presence, loyalty, and consistency in relationships.

I'm very talkative when I’m comfortable and can dive into deep topics for hours. But I’m also a great listenerif you enjoy real conversation, we’ll probably get along great.

As for the future, I’m working toward possibly starting my own company. Personally, I hope to find a monogamous partner to build a loving, peaceful life with. Maybe a family one day, a cozy home in the city and some peace in the countryside too. And of course, traveling together would be amazing.

I’m not here for anything casual. I’m really looking for something meaningful. If you're someone who’s emotionally available, loyal, and also looking to grow with someone long-term, I’d be happy to hear from you.

I think voice or video chats really help create a real connection, and I’m totally open to that once we get to know each other. Same goes for sharing photos if we’re both comfortable.

1kbfl8y,https://i.redd.it/rs6iijuixyxe1.jpeg,Case study: How Trump Hotels & Casinos became a penny stock,"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Donald Trump stormed into Atlantic City with a string of headline-making casinos—Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the crown jewel: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal. It was designed to dazzle—massive, opulent, and funded by high-interest junk bonds. The gamble was real. So were the stakes.

Within a year, the Taj Mahal went bankrupt.

Almost immediately, U.S. casino corporations like Caesars and Bally’s began circling the Atlantic City boardwalk like vultures. While Trump scrambled to cover bond payments, Caesars was locking in tax offsets, leveraging state connections for land, and securing infinite Wall Street capital to route him out of Atlantic city. 

The writing wasn’t on the wall—it had already been signed in corporate ink. 

Those same corporations would eventually swallow Atlantic City—and Trump’s footprint along with it.

When the Taj Mahal finally closed in 2016, the workforce didn’t disappear. 

The dealers stayed. 
The waitstaff stayed. 
The janitors stayed. 

The only thing that changed? 

Their pay got cut, their hours got worse, and the name on the paycheck was Caesar. A las vegas conglomorate ran by fund manager in New York. 

This wasn’t reinvestment. It was recycling—at a discount.

Today, the same model plays out across the country. Starbucks didn’t win by making better coffee. It won by controlling corners. It planted itself across Manhattan, sometimes with two stores on the same block—not to serve more customers, but to freeze out any challenger. Walgreens gobbled up Duane Reade. CVS finished off what was left of the independent pharmacies. 

Once the field was cleared, they jacked up prices and cut back manned hours. Prescriptions took longer. Help desks turned into kiosks. It wasn’t efficiency—it was extraction. Dunkin’ gets the leftovers. Everyone else vanishes.

McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A aren’t fast food businesses anymore. They are vertically integrated asset systems. They control the land beneath their stores, the supply chains that feed them, the franchise terms that govern them, and the national ad budgets that drown out competition. They even control the financing that fuels expansion. If you’re not already inside the machine, you don’t get to challenge it. You’re expected to get out of the way.

And behind it all, the real corporate power doesn’t wear logos or aprons. It operates from the top floors of BlackRock, Vanguard, and Apollo. 

These US corporation asset managers and holding companies sit quietly behind every major brand that dominates your street. 

Caesars is controlled by Apollo Global. MGM is tied to Comcast and NBCUniversal. Penn Entertainment is held by BlackRock and Vanguard. Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Amazon—it doesn’t matter which logo is out front. The same institutional overlords own slices of all of them. Same structure. Same dominance.

This isn’t a market. It’s a loop. A closed circuit of capital and consolidation. And once you’re outside of it, you don’t get back in.

And now Trump’s back—this time not to build casinos, but to break the monopoly that crushed him. 

And they’re kicking and screaming. 

Because they know it’s personal. 
For him. 
For the janitor. 
For every American who got steamrolled by a U.S. corporation that valued stock charts over people. 

What’s coming next won’t be polite. It won’t be easy. And it won’t be pretty.

But if there’s anyone with the thick skin and raw drive to tear down the walls they’ve built around this rigged economy—it’s him.

And I can’t wait to watch it unfold.
Because maybe—just maybe—Americans will be free once again.
Free from the corporate monopoly that stole their paychecks, their towns, and their future.",2,1746017185.0,Economy101,0,1.0,False

It’s a simple, growing directory of **Indian coffee roasters** – with over 50 brands and 600+ products listed (beans, blends, single origins, etc.). You can explore by roaster and expand to see some of their coffees + direct links.

# Why I built it:

As a new home brewer myself, I found it frustrating how scattered info was — some roasters only on Instagram, others with minimal sites, and no way to browse everything in one place. So I decided to make one.

# What's live now:

* ✅ 50+ roasters listed
* ✅ Expandable coffee product lists
* ✅ Roaster website links
* ✅ Feedback form for feature requests, bug reports, and roaster suggestions

# What’s brewing next:

* 🔍 Filters (roast level, brew method, region, etc.)
* 🛠️ Improved product classification (some gear like filters/snobs have snuck in 😅 — cleaning that up)
* 💬 User comments and ratings for coffees (because one person’s “acidic” is another’s “bright”)
* 📚 Brewing guides + starter tips
* ⭐ Featured roasters (soon)

Hi! First of all, before diving into the good stuff, let me give you a little backstory and introduce myself quickly. Nice to meet you - I am Theo. I also go by the username VLRevolution.

Since I mostly build solo, I like to think that Theo is the CEO while VLRevolution is the dev - a clear separation of concerns, a concept commonly used in software development to keep things simple and write good code as a result. On a solo unicorn journey, it helps to be able to operate in multiple modes: sometimes to look at things from the perspective of the CEO, to make sure we don't get lost on the way, yet the responsibility of the daily grind falls on the shoulders of the rebellious rockstar dev whose heart always fights for his vision to see the light of the day.

I am a self studied full-stack developer, specialized in studying how to design & build scalable real-time apps. I pride myself in my drive & talent for designing the best user experiences possible. **Lesson number 1: UX is the king!**

For the past 100 weeks I've been building a project that I consider a dream project and this is my story. Buckle up!

**Why should you care:** I will share real valuable but mostly painful lessons.. It's like how 50 lays it down so poetically in ""Many Men"":

    “Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
    Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain”

This journey begins about 6 months after ChatGPT went viral for the first time, at the beginning of the summer of 2023. As soon as ChatGPT exploded onto the scene I knew that my time had come: it was now or never - time was seemingly running out! I had that rare moment of inspiration that a revolution was on the verge of coming, but it took me another 6 months before I wrote the first lines of code towards what would eventually become my baby: UNI AI was born. I made the first commit on Jun 21, 2023.

I was inspired by the clear vision of how the world had suddenly changed: we now had computers that could think even if this thinking was not yet production ready, it was clear that it would only get better from this point forward. For me this was the moment of proof that the ""singularity"" was real and near, predicted by the written works of some of the greatest thinkers starting with John von Neumann in the mid-20th century followed by I. J. Good (1965), Vernor Vinge (1980s-1990s) and most recently Ray Kurzweil (Late 1990s - Present).

For me singularity means the moment each one of us becomes superhuman through leveraging state-of-the-art AI to transcend the traditional limitations of time, resources, and knowledge. I believe in the limitless potential within each of us, and UNI AI is positioning itself as a project that will provide the intelligent tools and ecosystem to help you realize it.

However, the project didn't start out being called UNI AI. Now inspired by this incredible new technology that everybody was so excited about and trying to learn and understand, I was trying to come up with a world changing idea that this new generation of AI models could power.

I'm going to be fully honest with you in this post, no glazing, so that you know this is authentic and the lessons are therefore also raw and real: I was still a less than whole version of myself back then, struggling with some emotional wounds, still a victim of my vices.. So on one fateful evening, self-medicating with some herbs, my creative mind started racing and helped me to conjure up a vision for the next generation of computer programs, apps. Programs and apps that mostly design and build themselves!

This was my big lightbulb moment: an universal app library of next-gen apps that anybody could easily build with just the power of their will, their mind, their thoughts. It's a grand vision for a future where willpower & ideas become a new form of currency, the stronger your drive & the better your ideas the more value you hold. I strongly believe in this vision - it is part of the core DNA of what I dream of achieving - to build a community powered ecosystem that values its people, its users. A system that enables you to monetize your knowledge, your life long experiences, skills and blueprints that acquired your talents, which you have earnt in your life. This is the good stuff that uniquely makes you who you are and in my opinion is truly invaluable. The ecosystem itself is going to be called the UNI CREATOR ECONOMY, but we are getting ahead of ourselves now...

I had a moment of inspiration and chose UNIAPP as the initial name for the project. The idea behind the name was that it was to become an universal app, the last app you would ever need as it would be powered by AI and have everything that previously existed, in a new and improved form. I even came up with a visionary tagline of ""UNIAPP - Dream, Design, Deliver"". First of all you would dream up a great idea for an app to make, then you would use UNIAPP itself to design its blueprint & let it auto-build itself. Finally you would be able to deliver a working app to thousands if not millions of users worldwide.

Now we are about to arrive at our first real painful lesson. The lesson is ever more painful as I had fallen deeply in love with this brand name. In a rush of excitement I started to build out a prototype to show to a close friend and long time business partner. We had been working together to come up with the next big thing for as long as I can remember... More on this later as our partnership in this project didn't go exactly as I had hoped yet I learnt a lot.

Months passed as I dove deep into the trenches of building this beast. Back then I was naive to think that it wouldn't take more than a few months to be able to launch a prototype. **Big mistake!** I was still a novice at app development, and had to study a lot first. Despite being a senior full stack developer, it was still super challenging and overwhelming to dive into full app development targeted at app stores instead of just the web. **Lesson: Don't underestimate app development vs web development, it has many more facets than a webpage does.** Always budget extra time for research & skilling up. Use time when you feel demotivated by slow progress to study & test new things.

Now the first big setback and one of the most painful lessons: as I got more and more frustrated with the slow progress I started to think more and more about how I could overcome these roadblocks and started to think about finding a co-founder who could help raise capital to hire other people to help me. For this to work I needed to establish the idea & brand more, to start pitching it to potential partners & investors.

To make sure the UNIAPP brand I'd be pitching was solid, I finally did what I should have done on the day I came up with the name: check if there were pre-existing trademarks in the categories we wanted to operate in. And guess what, fatefully UNIAPP is a trademark that is already registered by a company behind an ""app to manage your entire education application journey"".

What a pushback this was for me! My brand had shattered in a blink of an eye and truth be told I was not ready to let go of the name I had fallen in love with, having already registered a bunch of domain names as well. **Lesson: In moments like this it's okay to feel down and take your time to grieve until you find the courage to pick it back up.** As the saying goes: it is what it is - when life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade, or in this case it was reversed: when life didn't give me UNIAPP I made UNI AI instead - a name I would come up with in the following months that was unique and free. Today it enables us to have a brand that is clear in what it does: a universal AI platform.

By the end of summer 2023 I had a working prototype of UNI AI that you could chat with, featuring over 2000 ""chatlets"" (our branding for these AI powered apps) that were AI generated with GPT-4. This was a dream come true, even though we were nowhere near the level of features required to monetise it, I had seen the idea work in action. An app that built itself!

**Lesson I learnt here: automations combined with AI are truly game-changing.** If you are just starting out, a series of node.js scripts that input & output prompts & json files goes a long way! (Or in any language really, I just feel that the first class async nature of typescript suits me the best).

So I offered my friend that I mentioned earlier to partner up as equal partners. I would do the development and he would take care of the business side of things: help raise money to make it possible.

This would later turn out to be a mistake because there was still some bad blood between us from our last endeavor that we tried to do together that kind of fizzled out. It didn't help that that idea was his and now I had this new idea. He agreed to help but doubted the idea as too ambitious.

**A big big lesson to learn here: never partner with somebody who doubts the core vision** \- unfortunately you can't force them to be passionate about it in this case. That's exactly how it went for us.

The nail in the coffin was probably OpenAI releasing the GPT store in January 2024, an identical idea to UNIAPP, seemingly making us obsolete. **Another big lesson to learn: never think that your idea is unique.** Always assume that your competition is already working on the same thing. This makes sure that you are confident in your own idea. If you then decide to continue and not pivot you will strive to make it better than anything that existed before or even better yet, strive to make it better than what could be coming soon - beating your competition down the road.

While one partnership was crumbling a new one was forming. The very first member of the very first online community I had established some years ago agreed to become a small time investor to help keep the UNI AI's gears turning. He had always believed in my vision and this time was no exception.

**The next lesson is kind of a no-brainer but nevertheless it's an important lesson I've struggled with a lot: you need to find ways to sustain yourself and your company for the time it takes to bootstrap it.** For me this has been one of the hardest things to get right: how to find the time it takes to solo build while also not running out of juice to keep going. The small investments received weren't enough! In addition to this I've worked part time webdev, some freelance automation jobs and a full time webdev job for a few months. I have even had to take loans from my family to be able to keep focusing on the project. When bootstrapping a company this is what you are signing up for. Be prepared. Be frugal, pursue the scrappiness. Don't lose faith in knowing that it will pay off in the end! Your Dreams need you, they can't exist without you!

Almost the entire year of 2024 I spent trying to figure out the pivot, the unique value proposition of UNI AI - the moat, while slowly but steadily building out the foundational features that a universal generative AI platform should have. What I knew for certain was that it was integral to the project's long term chance of success to stay private to be able to uphold the commitment to the community, to become the AI project that we all deserve.

The profits of UNI AI should be shared with the founding members, early adopters and creators who help make it possible and directly support its growth from a small sprout into a mighty wise old tree. UNI AI will acknowledge and remember every supporter.

To make this into more than just an empty promise I've spent countless hours devising & crafting UNI AI's ecosystem that is powered by what I like to call the loyalty currency of UNI AI: the Light Points (LP) system. LP accurately measures the level of engagement & support and is the perfect resource and mechanism to drive engagement, to reward the hardcore early believers the most.

UNI AI's ecosystem is gamified - every significant action triggers a real-time LP reward. A leaderboard helps to measure yourself up against other community members. Everybody has an equal chance to establish their own AI legacy. If you are not yet ready to commit to a paid plan you can use LP to try out different chatlets and even generate images (limitations apply). I've designed UNI AI from the ground up for viral growth with the promise to funnel fair portions of profits back to the community.

Does this sound interesting to you? UNI AI hasn't launched yet so you still have a good chance to become one of the 2220 Founding Members by visiting [uniai.io](http://uniai.io) right now. Join the waitlist to receive a notification 48 hours before the launch so that you can be ready when UNI AI beta v0.9 launches. This version will allow you to claim an unique UNI ID, which is your unique place in the project's history. The first 2220 UNI ID claimers lock in the founding member's status forever, the rest of early joiners get an almost equally exclusive Early Adopter status.

It took me until the end of the year 2024 to really figure out how to position UNI AI as what it is today: an AI to 10X your Growth and Creation...

In the middle of 2024 I was still struggling with some emotional turmoil that originated from a failed relationship. **A huge huge lesson that I learnt from the ups and downs that come with a failed relationship is to avoid falling in love with somebody who is not cut out for the start-up life.** If you want to pursue your dream company yet your life partner wants to live an ordinary family life, it can create significant challenges! Both of you will likely end up miserable, as there is often not enough time to fully commit to both paths.

**Lesson: I would advise you to fall in love with your dreams first, to see them blossom, and only then start to look for a serious relationship.** Always operate from a position of power - to be in a position of power you have to honor your personal journey. I like to say that I am now married to my business, just to protect myself from foolish and compulsive thoughts of seeking out a companionship too soon. To have a chance at a truly happy relationship I think you should first become fully independent and whole by figuring out how to cultivate personal spiritual & material success.

I committed to try to rid myself of the self destructive patterns that resulted from the emotional wounds, starting in the autumn of 2024, by fully dedicating myself to protecting my health no matter what and staying true to it, no more compromises I told myself! It was time to heal and become whole again.

**Lesson: The easiest way to lose focus is to stop caring for your health out of spite for ""what has happened"".** This is false, remember to forget what has happened so that you can fully focus on what you can make happen now.

To improve our chances to sustain this challenging lifestyle, it matters what we put in our body and even what kinds of thoughts we constantly think, what kind of habits we are ""victims"" of. For me, the way to become whole again is to commit myself to a strict regime of breathing exercises, meditation, running and yoga.

My daily schedule looks like this: I wake up, brush my teeth, sit down in the sun to do breathing & meditation exercises for 15 minutes, finishing it off with some powerful mantras that focus on cultivating self love, gratitude and inner wealth. Then I head outside for a 70 minute run.

This is quite extreme and I didn't start out for 70 minutes. You should probably start at 25-30 minutes first if you want to level up your cardio & overall health and keep adding 5-7 more minutes every month - that's how I have built it up to 70 mins daily. After I'm done with my run, during which I think through many issues and daily challenges ahead to try to prepare myself for the day's work, I make a mental todo list and decide on the very first task that I should be able to knock out in my morning work ""slot"".

I take a shower, finishing it with ice cold water to wake myself up for what is about to follow. I cut up some fruits and make myself a herbal tea, eat and then dive in.

The commitment to my health involved giving up coffee - this is probably a polarizing opinion but caffeine is a strong drug that does have some pretty solid side effects which for me over time start stacking, affecting the quality of my rest & sleep and in turn resulting in less productivity rather than being a helpful addition to my life. Also I feel more at peace & ease when caffeine free. To each their own I guess!

I work almost all day. In the middle of the work day, I head outside for a nice walk for about an hour to take a break as well as to be able to brainstorm some more. I love brainstorming while walking; most of my best ideas come to me while walking in nature.

Then I eat dinner after which I might read a bit and rest while I digest, then restart work and work until late at night, usually finishing about 10-11pm. Then every night I'm committed to 1-1.5 hours of yoga. I've been practising yoga for about 10 years now and this is the secret that allows me to go running every day without messing up my legs - you need to stretch a lot!

Overall, all of these things contribute towards having great health that will sustain you through long periods of intense building.

**Lesson: Taking care of your mind & body by having a holistic health routine is non-negotiable for sustained high performance and clarity, especially when bootstrapping.** If you want to level up your life, explore practices that resonate with you – breathing exercises, meditation techniques, yoga, movement, nutrition. Find what sustains you.

After making this commitment, things started to fall into their places and I finally had the mental clarity to clearly see what had been missing in the definition of UNI AI. I had been too focused on coming up with an idea that would make the AI itself better than the human.. This is wrong!

I had a lightbulb moment that the most valuable thing to do would be to create an AI that helps us to become the best version of ourselves! Not to create an AI that will literally replace us in all aspects, making us obsolete. That sounds depressing, right?! But the version of AI that will tirelessly fight alongside us for our betterment, enlightening us to our limitless potential within, that sounds pretty empowering, right?!

From this point forward I became insanely passionate about finishing this vision of UNI AI, to build out the core collections that make up the core of the UNI AI, featuring around 80 core chatlets focusing on growth, mastery, creation and transformation. The new taglines for UNI AI are now ""The Growth and Creation Engine"" and ""10X Your Life"".

This brings me to today: The Growth and Creation Engine is almost ready to see the light of the day! For the time being we are still going to be in the waitlist stage for a while but please make sure to sign up at [uniai.io](https://uniai.io) to receive a notification 48 hours before the beta version launches. Come build the future of AI together with us.

Don't let AI replace your life.

You deserve it all...

I will finish this long post with some more poetry, this time from the boogeyman himself, Kendrick Lamar from ""man at the garden"":

    “Twice emotional stability
    Of sound body and tranquility, I deserve it all
    Like minds and less enemies
    Stock investments, more entities, I deserve it all

Hey there ! 
Sorry if it is not really close cooking and may be a long shot .

I’m just wondering how to use food coloring proper , like is it same as water painting?

Recently I’m doing a project is try to make a fake coffee latte .

I will make a 500ml clear concentrated liquid per batch, and take 30ml out of it and mix with 250ml milk to make a cup of fake latte. 

But I’m trying several times, the food coloring just can’t make color proper or close . It is always too dark or too purple The coloring I use is red yellow blue .
100 concentration liquid with 10ml yellow,5ml red , 1.5ml blue and take of 30ml mixture mix with 250ml milk

Just wondering if anyone has some good idea that doesn’t mind to share with me or there is any chance or place I could learn how to use food coloring properly.

1kbfc6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1kbfc6g/echoes_of_you/,Echoes of You,"I was doing okay today—
or at least pretending well enough to pass.
The sky looked blue,
the coffee tasted warm,
and for a moment, the ache in my chest
dissolved into the background noise of life.

But then the ghost of you sneaks up from behind,
pulling me into a bittersweet embrace.

“Remember the good times,” it whispers.
“The fun that we had,
the love that we shared,
the conversation that flowed like a good wine,
and the comfort that felt as light as breathing air?”

And while the memories are fond,
while the movie playing in my head is one I enjoy,
it still haunts me—
to know that you are out there, physically well,
unable to be my lover.

Since time was a cruel mistress,
and life’s responsibilities a jail warden,
they sentenced us to distance,
to longing,
to love suspended mid-air.

I look for pieces of you
in the lovers I reach out for,
but they’re all fleeting—
just like the relief I find in your similarities.

Your laugh, your smile,
the tone and inflection of your voice,
your all-encompassing love…
your ginger hair—
they echo in fragments that never quite fit.

And when the night falls quiet again,
I whisper into the dark,
“If I can’t have you now,
please let me live long enough
to hold you once more.”

Because what breaks me
is not the thought of losing you,
but the thought of you returning—
and finding me already gone.",1,1746016450.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

Competitor trackers flood spreadsheets, MAP compliance tools bombard inboxes with alerts, and someone’s always asking for a “heatmap thingy” before tomorrow’s meeting. But here’s the kicker: [73% of companies still price based on gut feeling](https://www.42signals.com/blog/competitive-pricing-data-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_30april2025). It’s time to fix that — with competitive pricing data.

**The Benefits of a Competitive Pricing Dashboard**

It’s 3 PM. Your top competitor drops prices on your best-selling product. Instead of panicking, you open a live dashboard showing competitor prices, margins, and product sales trends. That’s exactly how a Milwaukee tool supplier kept 92% of sales intact — without dropping prices. Their data revealed buyers wouldn’t budge over $20 and that the competitor was just clearing stock.

**What Pricing History Can Teach You**

When a Texas BBQ chain tried dinner-hour surge pricing, it flopped. Why? They ignored years of customer behavior data. Your past mistakes, competitor patterns, and discount trends hold pricing gold — if you mine it right.

[Here’s how](https://www.42signals.com/blog/product-price-tracking-strategies/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_30april2025):

* Audit failed promos (like fireworks-themed diaper sales).
* Learn from rivals’ seasonal pricing history.
* Track patterns in MAP violations over time.

**MAP Compliance: Protecting Your Brand Reputation**

MAP policies aren’t just legal terms — they shape price perception. One retailer learned this the hard way: unchecked Amazon sellers made $1,299 pianos look like $799 products.

* Reward compliant sellers with exclusives.

I am staying in singapore and i normally drink long blacks and latte . 2-4 cups a day.

Machines that are available and has customer service are  lelit(most model) ,rancilio  silvia and silvia pro x. 

I also know i have to invest in a grinder. So my budget with machine plus grinder would be 2.5k in total.

I am torn between taking rancilio silvia and its pro version. I was thinking maybe i could save up more to get the pro version or maybe get lelit bianca.

1kbf64o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1kbf64o/i24m_confessed_my_feelings_to_her23m_months_ago/,"I(24M) confessed my feelings to her(23M) months ago, she still hasn’t given me a clear answer, and she keeps postponing answering","

Hello po sa lahat! She (23F) and I (24M) were classmates/friends during college, so we have known each other for a long time, 4 yrs. minimum. We are both from Metro Manila. Apparently, many of our friends knew that I had a crush on her, so they keep urging me confess to her. I have no experience in being in a relationship and I had never confessed to anyone, so I lacked the  courage to confess to her. 

Fast forward to last december during christmas season, she invited our friend group to go to the mall as she was on her way there, luckily I was near there so I told her I was going. It ended with only the two of us meeting up. We had a great time, and we mostly did window shopping and chatted while going through the mall. As we chatted, she suggested going again on Christmas day, and of course I agreed. We did go again at christmas day, and I invited her again on another day to go to a coffee shop. With our meet-ups and ""galaan"", I decided that I should confess my feelings to her. She invited me to go to the mall(a different one) and I decided this was the day I'm going to confess my feelings. On our way home after going to the mall i suggested going to a coffeeshop and there I confessed my feelings and told her I wanted to court her. Well unfortunately I wouldn't be posting here at reddit if my confession went well, lol. She said she couldn't give me an answer, reason being she was an ""INC"" member and I was a Christian and also I was reviewing for an upcoming board exam and didn't want to distract me. I knew our religion would be a problem, but she said it's okay if I didn't convert to her religion as she also thinks it's wrong that I'd have to convert in order to enter a relationship, she was just worried about what her grandparents would say. In the end she told me she would give me an answer after my board examination. 

After that we continued to go to malls and going to coffee shops at least once every other week(we limited are meet-ups as I had to review), we did go out during valentines day. Fast forward to after my board exam our friend group went out for a night swimming, we were with our friends so I didn't get the chance to be alone with her. When we went home I went along with her on her way back to their house. I asked her what was her answer to my confession and if I could get her permission for courting her. I expected that I was going to hear her answer if it was a ""yes"" or ""no"". But unfortunately her answer was ""She needed more time to think about it."" Naturally I was disappointed in her answer, but I replied ""okay lng, hindi naman ako nagmamadali.""  The reason she said she couldn't answer me was because she was going to be taking the next board exam and needed to review. To be honest, I wasn't convinced with that reason, but decided to accept it. 

For the past 4 months since I confessed to her, the thought of her answer really weighed my mind, so to hear that she needed more time really hurt me as if I was rejected. Additionally I noticed that I was always initiating the conversations in our chat at messenger and she seldom started conversation, I told her about this and she replied it's just how she is. When I don't chat her for a whole day she wouldn't chat me but she does reply to me if I started a convo, and sometimes she takes a while to reply. She does agree to go out if I invited her, so I'm really confused about her chats and her agreeing to go out. If she doesn't chat me, I start to think she doesn't care about me, but when going out she does agree. It's not like she isn't active at social media, in fact she shares about at least one or sometimes about 4 posts per day in fb. She also chats in our group chats on days we don't chat, she's okay not chatting me but chats on our gc that I'm a part of. And about her taking the board exam as the reason for postponing her answer, I can't help but think that maybe she thinks as me as a distraction, I mean I took the last boards I can help her in her review. I can't help but think there's another reason.   I've read some posts on reddit about no label relationships and I feel like I'm in a similar situation. As I read some of the posts I start to think maybe I should just stop this but I still really like her. It's not like I'm asking her to be my gf already, I'm just asking her if I can court her. And I feel like I can't even step on the starting line in this situation.

I feel like I should have another conversation with her about our relationship. I don't want to pressure her for an answer, I don't think her answer will be genuine if I rushed her. I want to ask her questions that will assure me about our relationship. What should I ask her and what should I say.",0,1746015957.0,CasualPH,3,0.38,False

[Leveraging Scalmalloy's compatibility with high-strength, lightweight geometries, this lattice-structured component demonstrates how additive manufacturing enables topologically optimized aerospace parts that minimize material use while maintaining structural integrity. - \(APWORKS\)](https://preview.redd.it/aooecwmgjyxe1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ad5f202502b2442430ae1e0adf8f08b2fd533a8)

# APWORKS, Equispheres partner to produce high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy for 3D printing.

In a move to strengthen North America's supply of advanced aerospace materials, APWORKS, an Airbus subsidiary specializing in metal 3D printing, and Equispheres, a Canadian aluminum powder producer, have partnered to establish regional production of Scalmalloy, a high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy engineered for additive manufacturing.

Developed for laser powder bed fusion and critical applications demanding strength, weldability, and corrosion resistance, Scalmalloy bridges the gap between traditional aerospace-grade metals and next-generation manufacturing technologies.

Until now, the alloy's availability has been largely limited to Europe and Asia, creating supply challenges for North American manufacturers looking to accelerate additive production.

Eliminating one of the final barriers to adoption, the newest partnership will see Equispheres produce Scalmalloy powder optimized for 3D printing from primarily domestic raw materials – a move designed to support aerospace, defense, and industrial users seeking faster, more reliable access to high-performance alloys.

The company's proprietary powder technology, designed for high uniformity and print speed without compromising mechanical integrity, will bring new scalability to a material prized for its combination of strength and lightweight performance.

""Scalmalloy will be a great addition to our line of high-performance materials for serial additive manufacturing,"" said Equispheres CEO Kevin Nicholds. ""North American supply of critical materials such as aluminum-scandium alloys is a key step toward securing the aerospace supply chain.""

Long overlooked due to its scattered distribution, scandium remains difficult to produce at scale despite being more abundant in Earth's crust than lead – a constraint that has kept global output low and supply chains heavily dependent on Chinese, Russian, and Kazakh sources.

[New recovery efforts in Canada](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/09/16/critical-minerals-alliances-2024/north-america-fortifies-scandium-supply/1936.html), however, are beginning to shift that balance – momentum that partnerships like APWORKS and Equispheres are now positioned to accelerate.

""Equispheres is a logical choice for expanding Scalmalloy production into North America,"" said APWORKS CEO Jonathan Meyer. ""Their expertise in producing high-quality aluminum powders for additive manufacturing, combined with access to domestic aluminum and scandium sources, positions them well for building supply chain resilience.""

[A bionic cabin partition created by Airbus, Autodesk, and APWORKS illustrates how Scalmalloy and generative design deliver lightweight, load-bearing aerospace structures.](https://preview.redd.it/x35ytjhojyxe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65646d5a23cb94fbc68d73302eb5637ae516932)

Beyond raw availability, domestic production of Scalmalloy streamlines qualification and part certification processes by reducing lead times and material variability – factors that often limit implementation in regulated aerospace and defense systems. Powder produced to North American specifications can be aligned more directly with design, testing, and production schedules.

Equispheres' process yields spherical, size-controlled powder engineered for consistent flow and packing density. These properties support faster build rates, reduced defect occurrence, and tighter dimensional accuracy – factors essential to scaling metal additive manufacturing in aerospace, propulsion, and satellite component production.

As global supply chains evolve to prioritize regional production of strategic materials, the APWORKS–Equispheres partnership aligns with broader Western initiatives to secure alloy inputs for aircraft, defense platforms, and industrial systems. Scalmalloy's entry into North American production adds a flight-proven, data-supported material to the region's additive manufacturing infrastructure.

Already validated in Formula 1 racing and aerospace prototypes, Scalmalloy delivers the structural performance – high tensile strength, fatigue resistance, corrosion durability – required for next-generation manufacturing.

# NioCorp Partnering with Nanoscale Powders LLC to Explore the Possibility of Establishing the First US-Based Mine-to-Master-Alloy Vertically Integrated Production of the High-Performance Material

***NioCorp’s Potential Commercial Production of Al-Sc Master Alloy Could Launch Prior to the Company’s Planned Production of >100 Tonnes/Year of Scandium Oxide at its Proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska and Would Use Scandium Produced at the Elk Creek Facility as well as From Other Sources***

***China Now Dominates the Scandium World, but North America is Now Positioned to Emerge as a “Leading Scandium Producer,” says NioCorp CEO***

**CENTENNIAL, Colo. (May 29, 2023) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“NioCorp” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NB) (TSX:NB) today announced its intent to launch a phased approach to commercial-scale production of aluminum-scandium (“Al-Sc”) master alloy in the US for commercial and defense applications.  Coupled with the Company’s intended plans to produce more than 100 tonnes per year of scandium oxide from its proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the “Elk Creek Project”) in southeast Nebraska, and depending upon the results of the Al-Sc master alloy initiative, receipt of necessary funding and other factors, the initiative could establish the US as a leading producer of scandium, according to NioCorp CEO and Executive Chairman Mark A Smith.**

**Under an exclusive agreement with Boston-based Nanoscale Powders LLC (“Nanoscale”) the initial work is expected to result in the production of several ingots of Al-Sc master alloy at potentially commercial amounts of scandium content using a proprietary process developed by Nanoscale that increases efficiency and reduces environmental impacts of Al-Sc production over traditional approaches.**

# >ON ~MAY, 26th 2023~Trying to get a handle on REE's I asked Jim to comment on the following: We have the NI43-101 report stating pounds in the ground and recent news (as mentioned below) stating 92% recoveries.

***NioCorp’s Rare Earth Demonstration Plant Showing Strong Rare Earth Recovery Results, in Line with Expectationshttps://www.niocorp.com/niocorps-rare-earth-demonstration-plant-showing-strong-rare-earth-recovery-results-in-line-with-expectations/***

*JIM - What I’m trying to deduce is final tonnage/output. Early on Scott mentioned expected over 750 tons per year of REE.* *Can you offer comment:*

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""REE separations extraction of the individual elements will result in only about a 1% further reduction in the overall REE recovery rate we have already demonstrated for extracting the REEs from solution as a group, as SX it is a very efficient process and our folks have years of experience of doing this kind of REE separation and purification at commercial scale. Thus, it is safe to assume at this point that total REE recovery rate from ore to final separated product will be around 92%. This is about the same as our scandium recovery rate, which is not surprising given that Scandium behaves just like the other REEs in solution.""

# Consortium secures UK funding to create low-carbon alloys using recycled aluminum strengthened by scandium.

In a significant move toward sustainable automotive manufacturing, an industry consortium including Aston Martin, Boeing UK, and NioCorp Developments Ltd. has secured approximately $3.8 million in UK funding to develop lightweight aluminum alloys and cast components using recycled aluminum strengthened by scandium.

This collaborative initiative, dubbed Project Pivot (Performance Integrated Vehicle Optimization Technology), involves leading automotive manufacturers, material scientists, and academic institutions.

The two main objectives of the project are to enhance vehicle component performance and reduce environmental impact by using recycled materials. Participants include Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover, Sarginsons, Altair, GESCRAP, and Brunel University London, all aiming to merge engineering innovation with sustainable manufacturing practices.

The project's steering committee, which features key players such as Boeing UK, Linamar, Alcon Industries, and Shell Re-Charge, is responsible for guiding its strategic direction.

Together, they are working toward developing low-carbon vehicle components through the integration of recycled aluminum, which reduces carbon intensity significantly compared to traditional production methods.

As part of this $8 million program, Coventry-based aluminum foundry Sarginsons leads the charge, having already secured $3.8 million in UK government funding via the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) following a competitive application process. The consortium members will provide the remaining funding needed to achieve the initiative's goals.

""The award of funding from the APC is a major boost to Project PIVOT, which seeks to leverage advanced metal solidification and digital-twin simulations to manufacture low-carbon alloys which will ultimately uplift the level of recycled content we feature in Aston Martin models,"" said Roberto Fedeli, group chief technology officer of Aston Martin. ""We look forward to progressing this project collaboratively with Sarginsons and our other research partners.""

NioCorp's role is to provide [aluminum-scandium master alloy](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2023/08/16/mining-tech/niocorp-produces-scandium-metal-in-us/1419.html) for the group's research and prototype parts development efforts.

By harnessing scandium's unique combination of lightness and strength, the initiative aims to enable innovative designs in automotive engineering and aligns with broader industry trends that prioritize decarbonization and the creation of materials that enhance fuel efficiency while maintaining safety and durability.

""Project Pivot is aimed at solving real-world challenges and doing so on an accelerated timeline that happens to line up very well with NioCorp's plans to come online with approximately 100 tonnes per year of U.S.-produced scandium oxide from our Elk Creek Project in Nebraska,"" said NioCorp COO Scott Honan. ""By almost any measure, the automotive industry has the potential to consume many hundreds of tonnes per year of scandium, and NioCorp will remain focused on supplying the scandium that this large potential market demands.""

# A DEEP DIVE INTO SCANDIUM & SCANDIUM ALUIMINUM RECYCLING:

# 🔍 Background: Why Add Scandium to Aluminum?

Adding **scandium** (even in very small amounts, like 0.1%–0.5%) to aluminum:

* **Refines grain structure** during solidification.
* Improves **strength**, **ductility**, and **corrosion resistance**.
* Enables **weldable high-strength alloys** (e.g., for 3D printing or structural aerospace parts).

Projects like **PIVOT** (UK) and **NioCorp** (USA) are working on improving scandium supply chains and integrating its use into aluminum production economically.

# ⚙️ How the Process Works (Industrial Overview)

Here’s the simplified production flow of an **aluminum-scandium alloy**:

1. **Scandium Source**: Scandium is extracted from minerals (like from NioCorp’s Elk Creek project) or recovered as a byproduct from other metal production.
2. **Scandium Master Alloy Production**: Scandium is alloyed with aluminum (typically 2% Sc in Al) to form a **master alloy**, e.g., Al-2%Sc.
3. **Alloying Process**: This master alloy is added in small amounts to bulk aluminum during melting.
4. **Casting/Forming**: The scandium-modified aluminum is cast and can be further processed (rolled, extruded, or 3D-printed).
5. **Heat Treatment (optional)**: Aging may be applied to precipitate **Al₃Sc particles**, improving mechanical properties.
6. **End Use**: The alloy is used in aerospace, defense, EVs, etc.

# ✅ ECHO Process Model for Scandium-Aluminum Alloying

* Identify the **mechanical and corrosion weaknesses** in current Al alloys.
* Research scandium's effects on **grain refinement and precipitation hardening**.
* Explore existing supply chain challenges (e.g., Project PIVOT’s aim to secure sustainable scandium).

# ⚙️ Create (Formulation of Scandium-Aluminum Alloys)

* Develop **Al-Sc master alloys** (typically Al-2%Sc).
* Introduce the master alloy into molten Al during casting or powder metallurgy.
* Use **thermodynamic modeling** to predict phase behavior and optimize Sc addition (e.g., <0.5%).

# 💡 Harness (Processing & Industrial Application)

* Cast or powder-print alloy into components.
* Use **age-hardening heat treatments** to form Al₃Sc precipitates.
* Apply alloy in **lightweight, high-performance applications** (aerospace frames, hydrogen tanks, EV structures).

# 🔧 Optimize (Sustainable, Scalable Deployment)

So I'm pretty hopeful that I'll finally be able to reap those savings from not having to go to a coffee shop any more. Should be able to break even by about 2076, just in time for my hundredth birthday.

1kbezii,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaNang/comments/1kbezii/small_group_meeting_spaces_in_da_nang_september/,"Small group meeting spaces in Da Nang, September 2025","I'm with a research organization that hosts small group meetings. Think maybe 2 to 4 groups, each with 6 people, meeting 9:00 to 5:00, for 5 days.

In temperate climates, we have booked university classrooms, or nonprofit work rooms. Now looking at Da Nang as a destination, maybe we should think differently. I'm seeing beachside lounges (restaurants, bars in My An) that are open all day.  We could also book a hotel if they had coffee lounge space where we could hang out for most of the day. 

Two couches facing each other, or a few chairs in a circle would be okay. A table we could sit around with laptops, with wifi available, would be better. 

Coworking spaces seem to only offer one meeting room. If we did find more meeting rooms, I'm not sure if the community would appreciate locking up the space for a week. 

Should we be thinking about not trapping people indoors for a work week?  With a place that offers coffee and/or food, we would be prepared to pay. Alternatively, if there's a hotel with patio (covered, against sun and rain), we could stay there. 

Our style isn't luxury. Think professors and graduate students.

Meeting outside for work isn't the usual plan for Canadians and northern Europeans. Is the culture and style in Da Nang different?",1,1746015395.0,DaNang,0,1.0,False

It’s something that my GP should have caught but since it’s not a bad-react type of interaction, it got overlooked. 

Also: nothing masks the taste of zopiclone, but according to science, orange juice works better than milk, water, or coffee
