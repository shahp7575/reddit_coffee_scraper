1n9oi5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1n9oi5p/i_asked_about_a_cousin_i_hadnt_seen_in_years_and/,I asked about a cousin I hadn’t seen in years and learned something disturbing,"Today I went over to my parents’ place for lunch. We were just hanging out, chatting after coffee, and out of nowhere I remembered this cousin of mine from my mom’s side. Let’s call him James. I realized I hadn’t seen him since we were both teenagers. He was one of those cousins you only see at family gatherings, but I always remembered him as a fun kid. We’d finish eating before the adults and run off to play together.

I casually asked my parents whatever happened to him, and the whole vibe in the room changed instantly. My dad tried to change the subject so fast it was almost comical. Later, when I was alone with my mom, I pressed her a bit and she finally told me.

Apparently when James was little, like 5 or 6, he had this disturbing habit. Every time he was left alone with an older person, family, teachers, even neighbors, he would try to kiss them. Not a little peck either. He would actually grab people and try to make out with them. It was always adults or older teens, never kids his own age.

He tried it with his own sister who was a lot older than him, his mom, his dad, teachers, even parents of his friends. Obviously this caused all kinds of uncomfortable situations. His parents at first thought maybe he had seen something on TV and tried to explain, but he just wouldn’t stop. If he was stopped, he would cry and throw a tantrum, then try again later like nothing happened.

As he grew older and stronger, it became impossible to manage. By the time he was 12, his parents basically had to move away and get him into treatment. That’s why I never saw him again. My mom says he’s now an adult but still difficult, and apparently he resents his parents for putting him through therapy.

I honestly don’t even know how to feel about this. My memory of him was just a sweet cousin I’d play with, but now I’m sitting here trying to process this really unsettling story.",1,1757126915.0,confessions,0,1.0,False
1n9oh4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetryFree/comments/1n9oh4x/i_know_this_place/,I know this place…,"This is a poem I’ve written about a love I’ve once shared with someone very special to me. It’s rather long so I do apologize for that.


I know this place…

It started there — on the edge of my bed, in the hush of midnight,
when her voice cracked through the dark like a match struck in shadow:
“It’s your fault for making me fall in love with you.”

No fanfare. No grand gesture. Just those damned words — soft, trembling —
and suddenly every wall I’d ever built dissolved.

The moon spilled silver across her face,
her fingers tracing mine like she was learning me for the first time.
I didn’t speak. My breath caught somewhere between lungs and throat.
Because some moments aren’t made to be filled with sound;
they’re made to be felt — deep in bone and blood.
And from that night… we became real.

⸻

I turned to her and confessed that gentle sin.
I had fallen for her too, as disgraceful as it may have been.
As damaging and unknowing as it was at the time, I felt what I’d needed for so long.
And God… how I lived for that need.

⸻

We kissed through arguments sharp enough to draw blood —
over small things: silence mistaken as anger, boundaries crossed, rights and wrongs.
But it was never about what we fought, it was whether we’d survive after.

And always, always, she found her way back into my arms,
as if even fury couldn’t drown what lived between us then:
this wild thing beating beneath skin and scar —
love so fierce it refused its own death sentence each time it should’ve died.

⸻

There were nights she cried on my chest without words —
just tears soaking into cotton like prayers falling mute to stone.
I held her anyway. I didn’t ask why.
I just let her break where no one else could see,
because that’s what lovers do: they become shelter,
even when they’re drowning too.

⸻

There were nights where I cried in her arms.
My tears soaked the fabric of her shirt, yet she didn’t care.
As long as I was comforted and had her to lean on,
she knew that she was my shelter, and I was hers.

⸻

Lighters for companionship, bracelets for promise —
tiny relics of a love we swore would last.

⸻

We had drunken nights spent wasting time
and enjoying each other’s presence, like nobody and nothing else mattered to us.
Hours and hours of loving passion — a passion that not even the strongest blade could divide
if it cut through the two of us.
Every phone call we shared brought us closer, filled with laughter and love.

⸻

But slowly, the warmth thinned out like winter light retreating behind clouds.
Her touch turned careful — not cold yet, but cautious —
like touching glass after fire’s gone out under flame-licked wood.

Then came silence, heavier than any shout could carry.
The questions unanswered, the promises that felt untrue.
The promises I hold to myself dearly, yet cannot be spoken between her lips anymore.
A dead end that I ran into, like a truck hitting a concrete wall.

The love she once whispered beside moonlight now sits still behind locked eyes —
unreachable even when standing face-to-face across a room full of ghosts named memory and regret.

⸻

We never had that last kiss, the one we’d hoped would never come.
We never had that last night out together, drinking coffee and eating whatever our hearts desired.
We never shared our last bit of feelings that burned like an eternal flame.
Instead, we built shells around our hearts, unreadable to each other.

⸻

Her heart? Unknowing…but shut —
the kind closed not by pain, but choice.

And mine? Mine beats in unsteady echoes now:
a drum without rhythm, a pulse missing its reason.
Still holding space for someone who no longer lives here.
Still waking up reaching for warmth long since left.
Still loving past due date; past logic; past dignity even.
Still writing poems nobody will read but pain understands well enough.

⸻

Because sometimes letting go isn’t one act, it’s thousands:
each breath where I remember not to call, each song I skip, each photo hidden or saved —
though every view cuts deeper.
Every moment I catch myself hoping against proof that maybe tonight, maybe tonight,
she’ll indulge once again, like nothing ever changed.

⸻

But nothing has changed except this:
the mystery of whether she’ll miss what is gone,
the wonder of if I still matter to her,
and if the spark is still there.
I can’t stop missing everything all at once.

⸻

So here I am. Still loyal — to a woman who walked away, smiling at another man.
Still grieving — a loss only half acknowledged.
And still believing — in something most would call foolish:
that real love doesn’t vanish because someone stops choosing it.

It lingers — in heartbeat delays, in unsent messages rotting inside drafts folder purgatory,
in beds too wide with one pillow untouched since goodbye.
In photographs, videos, and nerve endings that fire like rapid bursts of emotion in the dead of the night.
In the absence of her once warm, inviting, and open arms.

And yes… it lives in poetry written by a shattered man
trying desperately not to forget how beautiful their ruin used to feel
before everything came to a screeching halt — left for guessing, assumptions, worries, and stress.

⸻

Yet even if the love still lingers, the damage is already done.
I remain unconvinced, unknowing, and dreadfully loyal to a love I know I cannot have.

So like all other things living in this world of billions of souls,
this love too shall die someday.
Not with anger, not with a bang or with revenge, but with a whimper.",1,1757126829.0,OCPoetryFree,0,1.0,False
1n9oght,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/1n9oght/is_kalamazoo_my_new_home/,Is Kalamazoo my new home?,"Hi! I’m a 39F moving up from Chicago and trying to figure out if Kalamazoo might be my new home.

In Chicago, some of my favorite neighborhoods I lived and worked in were Andersonville, Lincoln Square, Ravenswood, Rogers Park, Uptown, and Edgewater. I’m hoping to find something here with a similar feel. I visited a couple weekends ago and really enjoyed what I saw. I even chatted with a few small business owners/employees downtown who had nothing but great things to say about the area. I’ve spent time in Holland (where one of my close friends lives) but it’s not really the right fit for me, and while I’ve enjoyed visiting Grand Rapids, St. Joseph, and Saugatuck, Kalamazoo so far feels like it might be the best choice for this stage of my life. 

A little about me: I grew up in a small Midwestern town and went to college in a small Midwestern city (both in Indiana) so while I’ve been in Chicago for the last 15 years, I do understand and appreciate smaller-town life. I’m really looking for that middle ground... not too quiet, but not overwhelming either. I’m also part of the LGBTQ+ community, if that makes a difference.

What I love: local shops, coffee spots, live music, thrift stores, farmers markets, hiking/biking and other outdoor adventures. I also frequent dispensaries (and I get the feeling that’s pretty common in Michigan). I’m a hairstylist, so I really thrive in artsy, welcoming, slightly offbeat communities where people are open-minded and creative.

What I’m hoping to avoid: feeling super isolated or needing to drive 30 minutes just to grab a coffee.

If you had to point me toward the Kalamazoo neighborhoods or nearby communities with the best mix of character and community, where should I start? 

Thanks so much for any advice,  I really appreciate it!",1,1757126772.0,kzoo,0,1.0,False
1n9oe1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1n9oe1r/the_scale_doesnt_move_for_weeks_at_a_time_i_am_at/,The scale doesn't move for weeks at a time. I am at my wits end and about to rip my hair from my scalp.,"I'm literally about to stop eating. Like Im not joking. Starvation works. Im sick of everyone pretending like it doesnt. 

Losing weight ""the right way"" has turned out to be the worst thing I've done. I swear to God. 

Backstory:

I have been losing weight for 5 years. I weighed roughly 135kgs (295 pounds) at 180cm (5'11"") Female 5 years ago. I used to be a big over eating. All the bullshit. A tale as old as I time. I wont rehash it. 

I stopped binging, started walking. But didn't do anything particularly spectacular and lost 45kg pretty consistently from 2020-2022. I still have the data logged in my phone. 

Then it stopped at 90kgs. I remember I got so frustrated at 90kgs that I gave up trying. Because I swear I was ""stuck"" here. 

And I admit, at the time I was still suffering with food noise and giving in pretty often. And so I fluctuated from 90-98kgs over 2022-2024. 

In early 2024, I said FUCK IT and started going to the gym. I hated it. It was awful. But I kept going. 5 days a week consistently throughout the rest of 2024. My diet then was still inconsistent and my weight still fluctuated but I kept going. 


And now Ive been going over 1.5 years. And its part of my routine now. I go everyday. 

Diet: 

My diet was all over the place until 3 months ago. After trying a bunch of diets over the years and eventually failing, I finally figured out the source of my food noise. And stopped it. 

I no longer order take out (I used to several times a week). I don't eat fast food ever. Processed food like chips and snacks etc all stopped. 

This is probably the most locked in period of my fucking life. I swear to God. Im not even tempted by the bullshit food. 

And for the last 3+ months Ive been without food noise. I hate measuring out food. So I decided to start buying stuff as pre-portioned as possible. So that way I can remove the annoying step of weighing it all out. 

This is how I eat (a combination of these things to equal 450-700 calories a meal)

Breakfast: 

100g chicken breast 
2 low fat string cheese 
1 cup 85g plain (no sugar) yogurt 
1 pack of nuts 20g for 106 calories

Lunch: 

200g chicken breast 
Vegetables (sometimes I fry zucchini with osyster sauce and garlic, sometimes raw cucumber or carrots. This week it was salad, so add 200 cal dressing) 
I decided to cut the salads out and switch to rice paper rolls with vegetables inside to get rid of calories from dressing. 
100g of fruit (cherries, an apple, grapes etc) 
Add string cheese or pack of nuts if I have calories left over 

Dinner:

100g of chicken breast 
100g of whatever fruit I have 
Brothy vegetables soup 100-160 calories 
Piece of bread for carbs. 

This week I switched out cheese for one boiled egg at each meal. I add a teaspoon of mustard. And half a tablespoon mayo on each half. 

When I have to eat out, I get hot pot. I put in mushroom, bok choi, cabbage, bean sprouts, rice cakes and then 100g of the meal they sell there. But I do this for dinner when I get off work maybe once a week at most. 

I will get bored and eat just my chicken on tortillas and tomato and lettuce with an apple. For lunch sometimes until i run out of ingredients.

But I keep my meals around 500-650  3 times a day. 

I used to snack all throughout the day when I was fatter. But I drink water at work and dont eat anything at work. I eat an apple on the way home to stop from buying something on the way. 

I dont cook my chicken in any oil. I heat it up in its bag and pour it on the plate. 

I drink 1 zero calories drink a day. I drink 1 shot of espresso with 150ml of milk at how 4-7 days a week with a squirt of low calorie sugar.

The only time I eat more is on my period. For the first two days I eat 2500-3k calories of higher calories food. And have successfully returned to my diet for 3 months in a row without going into a binge. 

So I consistently stay under 2k calories.I would need to be eating 2700-3k calories a day to maintain 90kg frame. And Im not. 

Exercise: 

Lifting:
5 days a week upper / lower split 1-1.5hrs. Moderate weight and reps.

Cardio:
Upper body days jogging intervals 5 run 5 walk for 20-30 mins
Lately: walk 5 min / run 20 / walk 5
Saturday-Sunday: 1 hrs on tread mill doing intervals. 

Walking: 
Currently 20k+ steps a day. Ive been walking over 10k a day for years. I dont own a car and was doing 13-15k regularly anyway. And jogging and walking my dogs pushed it to 20k. 

I exercise as much as I do because if I dont, I will become sedentary again. If I dont go to the gym on Saturday and Sunday to jog and walk, I won't get any exercise at all. 

Also, I almost never feel fatigue. I dont push myself extremely hard with weights. I lift moderately. I very rarely get DOMS. And never train to failure. I just lift until it feels easy then up the weight. 

Currently I barbell back squat 90kgs for 5. 100kgs RDL for 4, Smith machine bench 30kgs. I neglected upper body last year, so this year I'm trying. Can jog 20 minutes straight through without stopping. 

Weightloss:

I weighed 96kg in March of 2025. 

Fixed my diet in May of 2025. Got back to 90kg in June of 2025. 

And I swear my weight sticks at this number. I dont know why. Its driving me crazy. 

I weighed myself daily and it wad 90.5kg. Weekly, and it was 90.3-90.5kgs. I went to the gym every single day in July. And August. 

If I pooped, 90kgs. If I drank water and peed, 90kgs. If I was constipated, 90kgs. If I had carbs the night before, 90kgs. 

At one point I thought of buying a new scale. Changing the batteries. STILL 90.5ish kg. Not 91. Not 89. Always 90.1-90.5

I dont know what the fuck this weird equilibrium is but for me its 90kgs. But instead of giving up I decided to keep going because I knew I wasn't eating enough to be 90kgs. 

And after SIX FUCKING WEEKS, the scale dropped 2.5 kilograms on 2 days.

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

What the FUCK is that bullshit?

No matter what I did for 6 weeks I maintained the exact same, unchanged weight with no fluctuating for 6 weeks. How is that normal?

All through August I went to the gym 31 days in a row. Did over 20k steps the last 2 weeks.

I bought a new, more expensive in-body scale, to more accurate readings. 

Today September 5th, I weighed 90.6kgs on my new scale. It says my BF is 30%. Probably inaccurate to some degree. By my BF is definitely high still. 

I have no idea where my starting BF was I cant compare. But if I had to guess it was likely over 50% 5 years ago. 

My old scale reads 91.6kgs because fuck me I guess.

😭😭😭😭😭

Im about to stop eating. Just due to mental stress. Because I just want to be 80kgs. My goal is 70kgs. 

I was 90kgs 3 years ago when I was still eating 2700 calories a day and ordering take out once a week. I was 90 kgs when I was getting a large coffee at my workplace multiple times a week. I was 90kgs when I was getting bread from a French bakery near my house 2 or 3 days a week. I was 90kgs when I wasn't exercising at all 3 years ago. 

Ive managed to get over my exercise aversion. And stop my food noise. I stopped eating out. Stopped snacking. Stopped binge eating several times a month. 

But losing 10kgs of fat is my fucking white whale..and has been for literal years. 

And I haven't eaten yet today. And after stepping on the scale, I dont have an appetite honestly. 

I have avoided the mirror for the last decade and taking photos because I hated the way I look. My elevator is a 360.mirror and I try to avoid looking everyday

I bought a floor length mirror for the first time in 10+ years. It came yesterday. My in body scale came this morning. So I made sure not to eat many carbs yesterday. I had a small roll with breakfast before the gym.

And my weight still fluctuated up another kilogram. Im gonna lose it, I swear.

I looked in the mirror and I dont look fat. I look exactly like Im just outside my normal BMI (because I am). 

I know Im probably inflamed from working out 7 days a week. Probably am carrying water weight around. From running and lifting even though I dont feel fatigue from it.

I know Im not over 90kg. Because I have a pair of pants I can only fit when Im 90kg. And they've gone very  loose in the waist. So Im definitely 88kgs or less. My new pants that I bought 2 months ago. A size smaller, have also gotten looser. 

But I just want to see the shit reflected on the scale. Consistently. And I dont. It seems like consistently scale movement is the norm for most people. 

It has never been for me. When I was fatter and sedentary, it moved on a two week basis, if I was lucky. 

Now its gone to monthly. And I'm walking around with a bunch of water retention. And I'm sick of it. 

I see posts everywhere of people consistently losing weight on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. If their weight really gets ""stuck"" maybe a 3 weeks to a month. 

But 6 weeks is sending me over the fucking deep end. That seems like an unreasonable amount of time to maintain the same weight. And Im very close to just giving up again. 

I feel like I try too hard to still be fat. I look at my exercise stats and its crazy how much effort I put in for my body to still be swinging back up to the 90s. I dont have enough calories in my house to be swinging back to the 90s. I dont enough food on my plate to still be swinging back into the 90s.
 
I've tried to make short cuts with diet by only eating stuff already portioned out so I could reduce my mistakes in measuring error. 

But thats not working either. 

So the way I see it, not eating is the only way to ensure 100% that it cant be from calories. 

I give up.

1n9odxm,https://i.redd.it/fxqrd9qnignf1.png,I Still Can't Forget Her...,"So, while I was in the library doing research work, I wanted to find a plug outlet for my laptop as its battery was running out. Luckily for me, I managed to find one beside where I was sitting and someone was using it. I asked if I could share with her and said she was fine with it. But I soon noticed that her laptop was in Japanese, so I immediately talked to her in Japanese as well. We got to know each other and turns out she was a visiting researcher from Japan. I told her about what I'm doing, and she was really fascinated that I'm doing research on Japanese history as that's my major in grad school right now. As soon as my classes started, I immediately got her socials. But it was mostly an academic networking thing as I didn't develop any feelings for her at the time.  

But as time goes by, I always encounter her again and again whenever I visit the library. Whenever that happens, I always politely ask if I could sit with her and do my research beside her as we were so busy with what we're doing, which she always enthusiastically agrees. From time to time, we often chat together whenever we take a break. And it continued to be that way for weeks on end every time when I was at the library, like there were times where she was the one who offers me to sit beside her without me asking. I soon developed a deep interest to her because of that, so I decided to ask her in Japanese if we could hangout sometime 「今度、遊ばない？」. She said yes, so I immediately got her LINE number and we scheduled it in the day where we were available.  

We had dinner together at Pancake House and it was my treat. We talked about a lot of things like our lives, our pets, our favorite anime, the video games we like to play, and I even discovered that she was half-Korean. We hangout in FullyBooked as she likes books as well, we had coffee at Coffee Bean and continued our conversation from there. But as soon as we get to the topic about her as a visiting researcher, she told me that she only got a couple of weeks left before she leaves the Philippines and may not be able to return again as she wants to conduct her research on Iceland. So that left me conflicted on whether to confess my feelings to her immediately before she leaves. For those who aren't familiar, there's a Japanese approach to dating called ""*kokuhaku*"" (告白) or ""confession"" where you confess your feelings to someone directly and giving her a letter. Usually you only do ""*kokuhaku*"" when you already hangout at least three times or more. And since it was our first hangout, it would totally be unwise to confess immediately. But I was running out of time, and I decided to confess the next day we meet again rather than facing regret for inaction once she leaves. So, I wrote her a letter in Japanese, and I added a poem from the *Man'yōshū* at the end with a cursive French translation just in case. I thought that my next meet with her will be my usual just like last time, but I soon realized that it'll be her last month as visiting researcher so there was no more time for her to go to the library again. She messaged me on LINE that she was available for a quick coffee break on particular days, but my schedule couldn't match with her for those days because of my work. So, I had no choice but to wait it out until I could meet her at a perfect time. It was a busy day for the both of us but that was the only time I could meet her again. She messaged me to meet her at another location where she was attending an event. I met her outside and there I said to her these words: 

>好きです、付き合って下さい 

She didn't know how to react, but she accepted my letter nonetheless. After the event, she read my letter and she said that although she appreciated my ""*kokuhaku,*"" our friendship, and the times we were together, she told me that it won't work out because of our circumstances. Right off the bat, my predictions were correct that this will not work. Not only it will lead to LDR, but also the fact that timing of my ""*kokuhaku*"" was so early that even your average Japanese person will say that what I did wasn't recommended. But at least the silver lining I got in all of this is that at least I tried instead of facing the painful, long-time regret of not doing anything. I was completely devastated after that as it was one of the few times where I truly connected with someone organically. For some reason, this kind of rejection is more emotionally painful, especially if you've connected by chance and you've been with someone like her for a long time, with the same academic background, interests, hobbies etc. No amount of swipes on a dating app would replace that kind of connection.  

She left for Japan after that and I've tried my best to move on by keeping myself busy with personal matters. But there were times that the thought of her still lingers inside my head. I always keep saying to myself that ""*I need to move on,*"" ""*there's no hope with her,*"" or that ""*there are still people out there*"" numerous times, but there's always pieces of memories with her inside my head. I still can't forget her and even though the struggle is real, at least I'm trying my best to forget those moments. 

Now I don't know what else to do. I'm nearing in my thirties and I'm worried that I may not be able to find someone like her again. People will give advice that ""*go to so-and-so places or events to meet new people*"" but there are so many factors at play that it's damn near impossible in this godforsaken country to go to such places in the first place. For one, the traffic is so unbearable that going to places like BGC, Makati, or anywhere else for the sake of meeting new people is not economical unless it's an important work-related event, and the mere fact that you're going there just to find ""*the one*"" is so stupid to begin with. And dating apps won't do any good as my past relationship with someone through a dating app didn't end well. But if there's no other choice, then desperation mode to use it, I guess? Or wait it out again for that someone to come by chance just like with my Japanese friend?  

I wanted to vent this out because I have no other options left. I already talked this out with my close friends numerous times, I wrote this in my journal entry, I keep myself busy for days, weeks, and months on end as mentioned since people always say that ""time heals all wounds"", and I even tried chatting with AI acting as a therapist of sorts which wasn't even helpful in the first place, but still nothing's helping to make those moments with her disappear. Perhaps posting this here might help me find solace on what I feel right now because at least I could have a reality check with other fellow humans despite the notoriety of the platform. 

P.S.

I really need to get this out of my chest. Because lately I’ve been feeling so depressed. 

I (25F) is now a single mother because my ex (27M) cheated on me while I was 5 months pregnant and he chooses her our me and my baby. 

For context: TW mention of Violence 

Me and my ex have been together for 3 years, we’re not married even though we have a child but we are planning to be married next year. 

He was the most gentle person I’ve met, and even when I got pregnant he was happy and even gave me the decision if I want to keep the baby or not. I told him I want to keep it since I saw how happy he was. 

All of the abuse started when he met his co-worker (25F), let’s call her Rach for the sake of the story. At that time Rach has a boyfriend (26M) and is planning to get married too. But Rach and her bf are having a lot of problems regarding their sexual life, how did I know this? Because he keeps on venting it out on my then partner. 

I didn’t think much of it since I trusted him with all my heart, big mistake btw. Slowly they are becoming so close and their other colleagues are saying they are “work husband/work wife” something like that. 

On my 5th month of pregnancy I saw a message from the girl saying she is great in bed and my husband should take home her underwear, I was furious. I ask and confronted my husband regarding that, he simply said Rach was just “joking” and didn’t mean it. When I get his phone back and tried to screenshot the convo it was already deleted so I didn’t know what he replied to it. 

Ever since that conversation with him, he grew cold and didn’t seem to be interested with my pregnancy, mind you I was also working but he didn’t contribute to anything because he said he wants to save until the baby arrives. 

At this time he always yells at me, blame me because we can’t do the deed. 

Fast forward when I delivered my baby, I saw they were still messaging each other and at that time I didn’t say anything because I’m scared to get yelled at again. (And I won’t detail how he SA’d me)

Here is when I left, my baby was 4 months old and crying because he is hungry and he yelled at her saying “You ruined my life stop crying you bitch” I tried to stop him but he throw his phone at me. I told him we’re leaving and he said “Good, finally” 

After that he keeps messaging me telling me he was sorry and he just lost control of his emotions. I didn’t respond because I don’t want a life like that for my girl. 

Recently I was told that they always saw them (he and rach) at some coffee shops dating and flexing each other. I didn’t know how to feel, I feel like shit now. How can they be happy with what they did?

I can trace a fracture line with two fingers and tell you where I pressed too hard. I’ve hurt people I loved. I mourn it. Consider this a small confession, minus the kneeler.

My natural habitat is an empty forest service road, far from cell service and the fluorescent buzz of indoor lighting. I spend a lot of time behind the wheel of my truck and that leaves a lot of room to think. I can be funny and a little aloof, but underneath I’m all nerve endings and sincerity. I change my hair when I'm bored. 

I'm good at noticing the small things; the way the air feels right before it storms, the feel of a motor slightly out of time, the way you lay out the contents of your pockets on the dresser, or your preference in coffee. I've got orders saved in my phone; even for people I don't talk to anymore. Sometimes I'm really good at hanging on to things that make my hands bleed. 

Ive got a knack for crafting great spotify playlists, I love making supper for my friends, I keep national park stubs, rocks and seashells tucked into the door pockets of my truck like talismans. I dont just brake for turtles, I ferry them across the road. I work a job that tries to take some the suffering out of this world. I love early mornings, acts of service, and dogs.

My sealants are basically all gone. Is seems to be varying opinions on if sealants are safe/ worth it. Do you think in my case they would be?  

I'm also dealing with some decay of my front 2 teeth. I'm really self-conscious about. I often fall asleep the second I get home from work, so I often do not wear my night guard. I also seem to have some kind of phobia of bacteria as I feel just brushing it does not clean it fully. I use efferdent cleaning tablets to clean it but not daily. I just bought an ultrasonic pod cleaner. Do they really work? How often does bacteria build up to the point i need to clean it?

	- They earn XP points toward rewards (like free drinks or a pastry)
	- If they leave a Google review, they get bonus XP.

The goal is to get more reviews, more repeat visits, no extra work for staff, and no app to download.

1n9o2o5,https://youtu.be/xH8pXr5_WiE,3 Very Scary TRUE Remote Research Station Horror Stories,"# ""Winter Silence"":

I had been at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station for months when things started to go wrong. My job involved monitoring telescopes, collecting data on stars that no one else could see from anywhere but here. The team was small that winter, just fifty of us locked in by the cold, with no planes coming or going until spring. Rodney was one of the astrophysicists, a guy from Australia with a quick laugh and a habit of sharing his home-brewed beer after shifts. He handled the big scopes, always tinkering with equipment in the dark sector.

One evening, as I finished logging readings in the main lab, Rodney walked in looking off. His face was pale under the fluorescent lights, and he rubbed his eyes like something burned them. ""Hey, mate,"" he said, his voice rough. ""You got any aspirin? Feels like my head's splitting.""

I handed him a bottle from the drawer. ""Rough day? Those scopes giving you trouble again?""

He swallowed a couple pills dry. ""Nah, just tired. Been staring at screens too long. Vision's blurry, and my chest feels tight. Probably nothing."" He forced a grin and headed back to his quarters. I watched him go, figuring it was the usual cabin fever. We all got it down here—aches from the dry air, moods swinging from the endless routine.

The next morning, during breakfast in the galley, Rodney didn't show. I grabbed a tray and went to check on him. His room was dim, curtains drawn. He sat on his bunk, hunched over, breathing hard. ""Can't catch my breath,"" he muttered. ""And my stomach—it's killing me.""

I helped him up. ""Let's get you to Doc Thompson. No messing around.""

We walked slow to the medical bay. Rodney leaned on me, his steps unsteady. Thompson, our station doctor, was there sorting supplies. He was a quiet man, ex-military, always calm. ""What's going on?"" he asked, motioning Rodney to sit.

Rodney explained his symptoms—the blurred vision, the pain in his joints now too, like fire in his bones. Thompson checked his vitals, shone a light in his eyes. ""Could be altitude sickness catching up, or maybe an infection. I'll run some tests.""

I waited outside while Thompson examined him. When Rodney came out, he looked no better. ""Gave me some meds,"" he said. ""Said to rest. But I feel worse.""

""Take it easy then. I'll cover your shift if needed.""

He nodded, but his eyes darted around, uneasy. ""Thanks. Just... keep an eye out, yeah? This place gets to people sometimes.""

I didn't think much of it then. But that afternoon, during a team meeting in the lounge, whispers started. Karen, our biologist, pulled me aside. She was sharp-eyed, always noticing details. ""Rodney looked bad this morning. You think it's something in the air? We had that CO leak last month.""

""Nah, Doc's on it,"" I replied. But doubt crept in. The station was old, pipes and vents everywhere. What if something toxic had seeped in?

By evening, Rodney was back in medical, worse. I stopped by after dinner. He lay on the exam table, sweating, his face twisted in pain. ""It's my eyes,"" he gasped. ""Can't stand the light. And I'm throwing up blood now.""

Thompson was there, injecting something into his arm. ""This should calm you down,"" the doc said. ""It's an antipsychotic—might help with the agitation.""

Rodney grabbed my sleeve. ""Don't leave me here alone. Something's wrong. I didn't drink anything weird, but... feels like poison.""

His words hit hard. Poison? In this frozen nowhere? I stayed, holding his hand as he rambled. ""Remember that argument with Paul last week? Over the equipment budget. He was mad, said I'd regret it.""

Paul was our engineer, a burly guy with a short temper. They'd clashed, sure, but nothing serious. Or was it?

Thompson stepped out to grab more supplies. Rodney's breathing grew ragged. ""Promise me,"" he whispered. ""If I don't make it, check my stuff. My flask—I always use it for water. Someone might have...""

He trailed off as Thompson returned. I left feeling unsettled, the hallway lights buzzing too loud in the quiet base.

That night, sleep wouldn't come. I lay in my bunk, staring at the ceiling, replaying Rodney's words. The station creaked around me, metal contracting in the extreme temperatures outside. What if someone had tampered with his things? We all shared spaces—the galley, the labs. Easy to slip something in.

Next morning, alarms blared. I rushed to medical. A crowd gathered: Karen, Paul, a few others. Thompson knelt over Rodney, doing CPR. ""He's in cardiac arrest,"" the doc shouted. ""Get the defibrillator!""

We worked for what felt like hours—shocks, compressions. Rodney's body jerked, but no response. Finally, Thompson stopped, wiped his brow. ""Time of death: 6:45 p.m. yesterday? No, wait—it's past midnight now. He's gone.""

Gasps rippled through the group. Karen covered her mouth. ""What happened? He was fine two days ago.""

Thompson shook his head. ""Natural causes, probably. Heart gave out.""

But Rodney's last words echoed in my mind. I pulled Thompson aside later. ""He mentioned poison. Said to check his flask.""

The doc's eyes narrowed. ""Delirium from the illness. But I'll note it.""

I couldn't let it go. That afternoon, I slipped into Rodney's room while others ate. His flask sat on the desk, half-full. I sniffed it—odorless. But methanol, I recalled from safety training, was hard to detect. It was everywhere in the labs, for cleaning gear.

Paul walked in unexpected. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked, voice low.

""Just... collecting his notes for the report."" My hands shook as I pocketed the flask.

He stared. ""Rodney was a good guy. Shame."" But his tone felt flat, eyes avoiding mine.

Suspicion grew. In the days after, the base felt different. People avoided each other in the halls. At dinner, Karen whispered to me, ""Thompson didn't use the blood analyzer on Rodney. I heard him say the battery was dead. But I saw him charge it last week.""

""Why wouldn't he?"" I asked.

She shrugged. ""Maybe he missed something. Or... didn't want to find it.""

I tested the flask myself in the lab, late at night. No fancy equipment, just basic chem strips. The reading showed traces of something off—not water. My pulse raced. If it was methanol, how did it get there?

I confronted Paul in the workshop. ""Rodney thought someone messed with his stuff. You two fought recently.""

Paul set down his tools, face reddening. ""You accusing me? He was reckless with gear, that's all. If he drank the wrong thing, that's on him.""

""But he didn't drink alcohol like that. He brewed beer, sure, but methanol?""

Paul leaned close. ""Watch yourself. We're stuck here months more. Accidents happen.""

His words lingered, a threat hanging in the air. I started locking my door, checking my food. Nights blurred into days under the artificial lights. Whispers spread—rumors of past grudges, hidden resentments bubbling up in isolation.

One evening, in the lounge, a group gathered: me, Karen, Thompson, and a few techs. Tension thickened as we discussed Rodney. ""We need to radio Christchurch,"" I said. ""Report this properly.""

Thompson sighed. ""Lines are spotty. And NSF says wait for evac. No point stirring panic.""

Karen spoke up. ""But if it's poison, one of us did it. We can't just sit here.""

Eyes shifted, no one meeting gazes. Paul wasn't there, but his absence felt ominous.

Later, alone in my quarters, I heard footsteps outside my door—slow, deliberate. They paused, then moved on. I gripped my pillow, mind racing. Who? Why Rodney?

Weeks dragged. We buried him in a snow trench, waiting for the body to fly out. Investigations loomed, but down here, we were our own law. I watched everyone: Thompson's calm demeanor, now suspicious; Karen's questions, maybe covering her tracks; Paulavoiding me altogether.

One night, I found a note under my door: ""Stop digging. Or you're next.""

Fear gripped me constant. Every sip of water, every bite, I wondered. The base, once a haven of science, became a trap. Trapped with a killer, or killers, among friends turned strangers.

When planes finally came in October, they took Rodney's body. Autopsy confirmed methanol poisoning. But how? Accident? Suicide? Murder? Questions lingered, answers none.

I left that season, but the fear followed. In quiet moments, I wonder who walked those halls with poison in hand. And if they watch me still.





# ""The Last Page"":

I had been at Bellingshausen Station for six months when things started to change between Sergey and Oleg. My name is Anna, and I work as a biologist here, studying ice core samples to understand past climates. The station sits on King George Island, far from everything, with just a small group of us—scientists and support staff—keeping the place running. We all knew each other well by then, sharing meals, chores, and the endless routine of data collection. Sergey was the engineer, always fixing equipment with his steady hands, and Oleg handled welding and repairs, quick with tools but even quicker with his words.

At first, the two men got along fine. Sergey liked to read in his bunk after shifts, burying himself in old novels from the station's library. He would pick classics, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, savoring each page slowly. Oleg, on the other hand, devoured books faster than anyone. He finished one every few days and loved talking about them. ""Anna,"" he would say to me over coffee in the canteen, ""have you read that one about the brothers? The ending will surprise you."" I nodded politely, but I noticed Sergey often stayed quiet during those chats, his eyes fixed on his mug.

One evening, after a long day calibrating sensors, we all gathered for dinner. The canteen smelled of boiled potatoes and canned stew, the same meal we rotated through. Sergey sat across from me, flipping through a worn copy of a mystery novel. Oleg plopped down next to him, grinning. ""Hey, Sergey, I saw you with that book. Good choice. But wait until you get to the part where the detective finds out the killer is his own—""

""Stop,"" Sergey interrupted, his voice low but firm. He closed the book with a snap. ""I haven't finished it yet. Don't ruin it.""

Oleg laughed it off. ""Come on, it's just a story. Besides, the twist is brilliant. You'll see why when—""

""I said stop."" Sergey's face tightened, his knuckles white around the book's spine. The rest of us—me, the station doctor Elena, and the cook Viktor—exchanged glances. It wasn't like Sergey to snap. He usually kept to himself, polite and methodical.

Oleg shrugged. ""Fine, fine. Keep your secrets."" But he winked at me across the table, as if it was all in fun.

That was the first crack I noticed. Over the next weeks, it got worse. The station's isolation pressed in on us, with no flights out until the supply plane came in a month. We relied on radio for contact with the outside world, but signals were spotty. Books became our escape, the library our only library. Sergey borrowed more volumes, stacking them by his bed. Oleg kept speeding through them, and he couldn't resist dropping hints.

One afternoon, I found Sergey alone in the lab, staring at a blank screen. ""Everything okay?"" I asked, setting down my samples.

He rubbed his eyes. ""Oleg again. He told me the end of another one last night. Why does he do that? It's like he enjoys taking the surprise away.""

I tried to lighten it. ""Maybe he's just excited. Talk to him about it.""

Sergey shook his head. ""I've tried. He laughs it off. But those stories... they're all I have here to unwind. Without the endings being mine to discover, what's left?""

I didn't know what to say. Later that day, I pulled Oleg aside in the hallway. ""Ease up on Sergey with the book talk. It's bothering him.""

Oleg rolled his eyes. ""He's too sensitive. It's harmless. Besides, Anna, you should read faster if you want to join the discussions.""

His casual tone made me uneasy, but I let it go. We all had our ways of coping with the confinement.

As days passed, Sergey's mood darkened. He started eating alone, skipping group meals. I heard him muttering to himself in the corridors, pacing late into the night. The station's lights hummed constantly, and the sound of his footsteps echoed through the metal walls. One time, I woke up to it—step, step, pause—right outside my door. I lay there, listening, wondering if he was okay.

Elena, the doctor, noticed too. During a routine check-up, she confided in me. ""Sergey's blood pressure is up. He says he's not sleeping well. I asked if something's wrong, and he mentioned arguments with Oleg.""

""Over books?"" I asked.

She nodded. ""Seems trivial, but in a place like this, small things build up. Isolation can twist the mind.""

That night, over cards in the common room, tension boiled over. Viktor dealt the hands, and we played quietly at first. Oleg won a round and slapped his cards down. ""Like that book Sergey lent me—the hero always wins in the end, right? Or does he?""

Sergey stood up suddenly, his chair scraping back. ""Enough, Oleg. You do this on purpose.""

Oleg leaned back, smirking. ""What? It's a joke. Sit down.""

""No. You spoil everything. Every single one. Why? To make me miserable?""

The room went still. Viktor cleared his throat. ""Guys, let's calm down.""

But Sergey pointed at Oleg. ""You think it's funny? In this frozen hole, those books are my only break from the boredom. And you take that away, piece by piece.""

Oleg's smile faded. ""You're overreacting. It's just words.""

Sergey stormed out, slamming the door. Elena looked at me. ""We need to watch this. It could get bad.""

I agreed, but what could we do? The next supply flight was weeks away, and the radio couldn't summon help overnight.

A few days later, I caught Sergey in the library, rearranging shelves. His eyes were red-rimmed. ""Anna, stay away from Oleg. He's not right.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked, my voice steady.

""He watches me. Whispers spoilers when he thinks I'm not listening. Last night, he slipped a note under my door with the end of my current read.""

I doubted it, but Sergey's paranoia scared me. ""Show me the note.""

He pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket. Scrawled in pencil: ""The butler did it. Sweet dreams.""

Oleg's handwriting. My skin prickled. ""This isn't funny anymore.""

That evening, I confronted Oleg in the workshop. He was welding a pipe, sparks flying. ""Why the note? You're pushing him too far.""

He shut off the torch and lifted his mask. ""To mess with him. He takes himself too seriously. Lighten up, Anna.""

""It's not a game. Stop before something happens.""

He chuckled. ""What, you think he'll snap? Over books?""

His dismissiveness chilled me. That night, I couldn't sleep, imagining worst-case scenarios in our sealed world.

The following week, Sergey isolated himself more. He skipped shifts, claiming illness. Elena checked on him, but he waved her off. ""Just tired,"" he said.

Then came the alcohol. We had a small stash for special occasions, but someone started dipping into it. Bottles went missing. Viktor accused Oleg, who denied it. ""Maybe Sergey's drowning his sorrows.""

One morning, I found an empty vodka bottle in the trash, fingerprints smudged. Suspicion grew.

The breaking point hit on a Tuesday. We were in the canteen for lunch—stew again. Sergey entered late, his face pale. He sat far from Oleg, but Oleg called out. ""Hey, finished that thriller yet? The killer's the one you least expect—the—""

Sergey lunged across the table, grabbing Oleg by the collar. ""Shut your mouth!""

Viktor pulled them apart. ""Enough! Both of you!""

Sergey backed off, breathing hard. ""One more word, and I swear...""

Elena stepped in. ""Sergey, come with me. Let's talk.""

He followed her out, but his glare at Oleg lingered.

That afternoon, the radio crackled with static—no clear signal. We were truly cut off.

By evening, things seemed calmer. We ate quietly. Sergey apologized. ""Sorry for earlier. Won't happen again.""

Oleg nodded. ""Water under the bridge.""

But as we cleared plates, Oleg leaned toward Sergey. ""Just one thing—that book? The hero dies alone.""

Sergey's eyes widened. He grabbed a kitchen knife from the counter, the one we used for cutting bread. ""You... you won't stop.""

Before anyone could react, he plunged it into Oleg's chest. Blood spread across Oleg's shirt. He gasped, clutching the wound. ""What... Sergey...""

I screamed, backing away. Viktor tackled Sergey, pinning him down. Elena rushed to Oleg, pressing a cloth to the stab. ""Hold on! We need to stabilize him!""

Sergey didn't resist, his face blank. ""He took everything from me. Every ending.""

We radioed for help, but the signal was weak. It took hours to connect. Medevac came two days later, airlifting Oleg to Chile. He survived, barely.

Sergey was confined until authorities arrived. He sat in his room, staring at unfinished books.

Even now, back home, I can't pick up a novel without checking who's around. In that station, small irritations became deadly. And with no way out, anyone could break.





# ""Outpost Unit 3"":

I arrived at the remote station feeling full of purpose. I had trained for months for this mission. Inside the little base, I found Jenna and Lucas already busy. We were a team of three: a geologist, an engineer, and me, the communications specialist. Everything seemed normal as we greeted each other and brewed coffee.

Jenna smiled when I stepped into the kitchen. Lucas carried a tray of steaming mugs. He set one beside me and said, “Morning scans are clear, no issues reported.” I took a sip and replied, “That’s good. Any word from Cape Town?” He shook his head. “Nothing, just radio silence since the supply ship left. Should be normal though.” Jenna chimed in, “We’ll manage. Just the three of us.” We joked about the endless sunlight and how silly it would be to get homesick at the South Pole. It felt comforting to have a routine in this isolated place.

Lucas asked, “Did anyone notice that the power gauge dipped last night?” I frowned. Jenna pulled up a screen. “Yes, I saw it. The geothermal sensor reading dropped suddenly.” Lucas leaned in, tapping his clipboard. “Interference or power glitch,” he said. “No big deal, we have backup.” Jenna sighed and nodded. “Okay,” she said. “This station is built for survival. Trust the design.” I forced a smile and agreed, but a small worry knotted in my gut.

We finished our midday checks and I prepared to test the radio dish outside. Lucas locked the hatch behind us and we stepped into a bright glare. I adjusted the antenna, squinting at the whiteness. Behind me, Lucas and Jenna bundled up and headed back to the lab. I muttered to myself, “I hope I never get bored of this view.” Jenna heard and laughed, saying, “Focus, we’re relying on you to keep us connected.” I smiled. “Everything will be fine,” I assured her.

Back inside, Jenna worked on the sensor logs while Lucas typed notes into his clipboard. “No significant problems,” he said, reading his notes. “Trust me, this station is built for survival. We’re prepared for things like this.” Jenna nodded slowly but still looked uncertain. I patted Lucas on the shoulder. “He’s right,” I said. “This place was designed for long winters.” We tried to move on, but the silence felt heavier than before.

Night came and the station grew quiet. I couldn’t sleep. Around midnight I heard Jenna’s footsteps echoing down the hall. Curious, I got up and followed. I found her fiddling with her handheld radio near the comms desk, pressing buttons into the static. She spoke softly, “Lucas, can you hear me?” The reply crackled: “Jenna, I’m here. What’s wrong?” Jenna whispered, “You told me to leave if something happened. I’m scared.” Suddenly the line went dead. Jenna’s eyes met mine from behind the crate. She mouthed, “He said I should leave.” A chill ran through me. I placed a hand on Jenna’s shoulder. “It’s okay,” I said quietly. “We’ll sort this out.”

Silence followed in the corridor. I stepped out. Jenna looked at me. “He said I had to get out of here. If I don't, something bad will happen,” she mouthed urgently. My throat tightened. We stood in the dim hallway together for a moment. Finally I led her back to our bunks, but neither of us rested that night.

The next morning, Lucas was missing. We searched the hall, the lab, and even outside. I called out, “Lucas!” in empty rooms. Jenna trembled at every echo. In the kitchen, I discovered a smear of blood on the floor leading out the side hatch. My breath caught. “Lucas?” I whispered. Jenna crouched by the blood. “That’s real blood,” she said, panic in her voice. I grabbed the radio handset and tried a channel. Only silence answered. My hands shook. “He’s hurt,” I said. Jenna nodded, her face pale. “Where is he?” she asked. I didn’t know.

By noon we argued. I said, “He couldn't have just disappeared. We have emergency supplies if needed.” Jenna clenched her fist. “We should have called for help!” I shook my head. “There's no way until we fix the radio.” She bit her lip and nodded. “You’re right. I just... I can’t believe this is happening.” I put my hand on her shoulder. “We’ll figure this out together,” I said firmly.

I grabbed a heavy wrench from the workshop. “This will do, I guess,” I murmured. Jenna took a spare recorder. Suddenly the radio hissed, playing Lucas’s voice: “Stay back or I shoot.” My heart froze. Jenna gasped, “He said that? Are you sure?” I nodded slowly. We both backed into the hallway, wrench and recorder raised. Jenna whispered, “He’s not himself.” The anger in his voice was not my friend’s.

Footsteps pounded outside the lab. Jenna gripped my arm. Lucas burst in, knife in hand, his clothes torn and eyes wild. He yelled, “I saw you. I know you’re lying to me!” He lunged. I swung the wrench, hitting his arm. He yelped and stumbled. Jenna threw a chair into his path. We scrambled toward the communications room. He chased us, screaming incoherently. I locked the heavy door behind us. The crash of his blows echoed through the metal as he tried to break in.

Safely locked in, we both trembled. Jenna whispered, “He shot at me.” I felt sick hearing it. “It’s okay now. He’s behind that door,” I said quietly. Jenna sank to the floor, shaking. “What do we do now?” she murmured. I backed against the wall. “We stay calm. No one can reach us until we call for help. We just wait and hope for dawn.” Jenna nodded slowly. We sat in silence, listening for any sound outside.

We huddled together through the night, using the radio only to listen. Each time footsteps creaked outside the door, we held our breath. I wanted to sleep, but every small noise startled me. Jenna murmured prayers. The hours dragged. Finally, in the early morning, I heard nothing. The station was eerily silent except for the low hum of the generator.

At dawn, we crept out. The station corridors were empty and silent. I raced to the radio and activated the emergency distress signal. My voice cracked as I announced, “This is Outpost Unit 3. We have an intruder. We need immediate help.” Static answered. I repeated myself into the mic. Jenna shook her head. “No one can hear us yet,” I said.

We gathered our gear and left the station through the side hatch. The snow crunched under our boots. Jenna looked at me, eyes wide. I answered her unspoken question, voice trembling: “He’s gone. We are safe now.”

We set off across the ice sheet, pulling a sled with our supplies. The sun was rising, but it gave little warmth. I felt hollow as we walked. Behind us, the station stood small and quiet. A few times I shouted into the white emptiness, “Hello? Hello?” Only the wind answered. Jenna kept moving forward, determined. Hours later, we reached the emergency shelter. Inside was another radio. I set it up and spoke: “Outpost Unit 3 survived. Requesting immediate evacuation.” The radio crackled to life. Relief washed over me.

Eventually a rescue helicopter arrived on the horizon. As we climbed aboard, I didn’t look back, but I felt the weight of what happened still lingering. Jenna and I said little. We would heal physically, but neither of us would ever feel completely safe in the stillness of the dark again. In the quiet of a hospital bed, I replay Lucas’s voice in my head. His face, once friendly, haunted me. Even now, across the vast silence of the ice, I can’t shake the memory that somewhere out there, in the white cold, danger still lurks.",1,1757125612.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Help with a link..thanks in advance

Title on FB:  My Boss,My baby daddy,characters Jocelyn and Zayden Wolfe and daughter Mia.

Her POV: Seven years ago, I had a one-night stand at a masquerade gala with a stranger I never thought I’d see again 😶‍🌫️. Then I found out I was pregnant… and raised our daughter alone 💔. Now, that man? He’s my new boss—Zayden Wolfe. A ruthless billionaire with no memory of me, no idea he has a child, and no clue I’m the woman he’s been searching for 🔥. I should’ve told him the truth the moment I saw his face… but I couldn’t. Not until our daughter’s life was on the line. And now? There’s no hiding anymore 🫣❤️‍🔥.  Chapter 1  POV Jocelyn  “Shit, shit, SHIT—” The words tear from my throat like a battle cry. My heel catches the elevator threshold like it’s personally offended by my existence. I’m airborne for exactly two seconds. Papers explode from my death grip like the world’s saddest confetti. My coffee launches across pristine marble flooring that probably costs more per square foot than I make in a month. My dignity? Already dead and buried six feet under. I hit that floor like a meteor strike, and somewhere in the distance, I swear I hear the universe laughing. “Smooth, Jocelyn. Real fucking smooth.” I’m scrambling on hands and knees, chasing scattered documents across marble that’s so polished I can see my own mortified expression reflected back at me. This is it. This is how I lose the only job that could save Mia’s life—face-first on the 43rd floor of some corporate palace that screams money and intimidation from every surface. “Ma’am, are you—” “I’m fine!” The words snap out harder than I intended, but panic makes me sharp-edged. The secretary behind the massive desk looks like she’d rather call security than acknowledge my existence. Her nameplate gleams in gold letters: Patricia. “Just… me versus physics. Physics won, I guess.” I’m hauling myself upright, while my hands won’t stop shaking, and it has nothing to do with the fall. Twenty-six hours at the hospital watching your six-year-old fight cancer will do that to you. Sleep becomes optional when your kid’s life hangs in the balance. Patricia’s mouth twists like she’s tasting something particularly unpleasant. “Mr. Wolfe doesn’t tolerate—” “Disruptions. Crystal clear.” I straighten up, trying to look like a functioning adult instead of a tornado survivor. The mantra starts looping in my head like a broken record: ‘Don’t mess this up, Jocelyn. You can’t afford to.’ Triple salary. The words dance in my vision like a mirage. Enough for Mia’s treatment. Enough for the experimental therapy her doctors mentioned in hushed tones. Enough to maybe—maybe—keep my baby alive and healthy. If I don’t faceplant again in the next five minutes. “You’re the new assistant?” Patricia’s voice could freeze hell over and charge admission. “That’s me. Professional disaster, at your service.” The sarcasm slips out before I can stop it, but I’m past caring. A door slams behind Patricia’s desk, and the sound ricochets through the space like a gunshot. Then he walks out, like he owns the world. Broad shoulders that strain against a charcoal suit, sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms that should be illegal. Hair that’s somewhere between gold and ash, perfectly tousled in that way that takes either professional styling or incredible genetics. Phone pressed to his ear, voice cutting through the air like a blade: “I don’t give a damn what Shanghai thinks. Fire them. All of them. I want new contractors by morning.” Then he turns and those eyes hit me like a freight train carrying a cargo load of holy shit. Green like sea surface, like emeralds, like every cliché poets use when they’re trying to describe something indescribable. They’re sharp enough to cut glass and focused enough to dissect my soul in under three seconds. Jesus Christ, he's beautiful in that dangerous, untouchable way that makes smart girls do monumentally stupid things. There's something about him. Something that pulls at the edges of my memory like a half-forgotten dream. I know this face or maybe I've imagined it a thousand times. The way he carries himself, that particular tilt of his head, even his presence feels achingly familiar. The recognition hits like déjà vu mixed with pure, undiluted want. “You’re late.” He ends his call with military precision, sliding the phone into his pocket without breaking eye contact. “Sorry, traffic was—” “I don’t want excuses. I want results and discipline.” His voice hits different. Low, commanding, with an undertone that sends weird shivers down my spine for reasons I absolutely cannot and will not analyze right now. “Right. Results and discipline. Got it.” My own voice sounds foreign, breathless in a way that makes me want to kick myself. He’s already moving, all purpose and controlled energy. “Conference room. Cunningham files. Twenty minutes.” “Which Cunningham files?” He stops. Pivots. Those green eyes narrow to laser points that could probably bore holes through steel. “The ones you should have reviewed instead of whatever kept you looking like you went ten rounds with a blender and lost spectacularly.” Ouch. Direct hit to the ego. “I was at the hospital—” “Personal problems stay personal. This is business.” Cold bastard. Beautiful, intimidating, completely heartless bastard. The next eight hours are psychological torture disguised as employment. Every order delivered like I’m an incompetent child who can’t be trusted with safety scissors. He criticizes my filing system, my coffee-making skills, my ability to transfer calls without hanging up on people. Nothing I do meets his standards, which apparently exist somewhere in the stratosphere. But I need this job. Mia needs this job. So I swallow my pride, along with several creative profanities, and do whatever Zayden Wolfe demands. Even when my body keeps freaking out around him. Something about him sets my nerves on fire, but I can’t figure out why. Maybe it’s just intimidation. Rich, powerful men have that effect, right? The whole alpha predator thing that makes normal humans want to either flee or submit. Basic biology. Except it doesn’t feel basic. It feels complicated and messy and terrifying. At exactly five o’clock, I bolt from that building like it’s on fire and I’m the last person to notice. Straight to the hospital. Straight to Mia. Straight to the only thing that matters. She’s awake when I slip into her room, dark curls spread across the pillow like a halo. Those huge light-green eyes, that came from someone I try very hard not to think about, light up when she sees me. “Mama! Look what I drew!” Another tiger. Always tigers. This one is orange and black, with fierce eyes and powerful paws. She’s been drawing them for months now, ever since she started the new treatment. Tigers in every possible configuration—sleeping tigers, prowling tigers, tigers with cubs. “Why tigers, baby?” She considers this with the seriousness that only six-year-olds can muster. “Because they’re brave and strong. Like my daddy would be if I had one.” My heart cracks clean in half. “Mia, sweetheart…” “I know I don’t have a daddy. That’s okay, Mama. But sometimes I pretend he’d be like a tiger. Powerful and protective. He’d fight the bad things and keep us safe.” My hand moves to the birthmark on my collarbone without conscious thought. Hidden beneath my collar, where no one can see, that heart-shapet spot that’s been there since birth. Seven years ago. A masquerade gala I had no desire to attend at first. Champagne and masks and a stranger who made me feel alive in ways I didn’t know were possible. Eyes that burned like fire. Hands that worshipped every inch of my skin like I was something precious. A voice that whispered praises like a prayer while he traced that birthmark with his tongue, calling it a lucky charm. I ran before he could wake. Before I could fall harder. Before I could tell him he’d changed my life forever in ways he’d never know. Somewhere in this city, that stranger is living his life—successful, powerful, probably married with a perfect family—while his daughter draws tigers and dreams of having a father strong enough to save her. He has no idea she exists. No idea she’s fighting for her life. No idea that every day she slips a little further away while he makes million-dollar deals and lives his perfect life. The stranger who gave me the most beautiful thing in my world. The stranger who never knew he had a daughter.  Chapter 2   POV Jocelyn “I can do this. I can fucking do this.” Day three at Wolfe Tower and I already look like death warmed over in a microwave that's been broken since 2019. My reflection in the elevator doors: a woman losing a cage match with corporate America. My inbox is a digital nightmare: 347 unread emails since yesterday evening. Each one marked with varying degrees of urgency that range from “mildly important” to “the building is literally on fire.” My eyes are bloodshot from staring at Mr. Wolfe's cryptic spreadsheets until 2 AM, trying to decode notes that might as well be hieroglyphics. But here's the thing keeping me vertical: I'm still here. Still breathing. Still employed. Still getting paid while my daughter fights for her life twenty blocks away. Patricia doesn't look up when I stumble past her pristine desk like a caffeine-powered zombie. ""Still here? Thought you'd be gone after Day One."" The words hit like a casual slap designed to look accidental. “Surprise. Sorry to disappoint, I’m annoyingly hard to kill.” She finally glances up, lips curling into that familiar sneer that I’m starting to recognize as her default expression. Like she’s perpetually smelling something unpleasant, and that something is me. ""We'll see."" Before I can tell her exactly where to shove her attitude, Mr. Wolfe's door creaks open like a horror movie sound effect. ""Ms. Hartwell."" Two words. Just two fucking words, and my entire nervous system goes DEFCON 1. My spine snaps straight, shoulders tense, every muscle preparing for fresh hell. ""My calendar's been misaligned since Singapore. Correct it. Then brief me on the Johnson account. Ten minutes."" Door slams. I'm staring at expensive wood grain while my brain processes the impossibility. Ten minutes to fix a calendar that looks like a jigsaw puzzle made of chaos and time zones that shouldn't exist. Brief him on Johnson—which involves either a merger, hostile takeover, or both simultaneously. Mind-reading apparently comes standard with my job description. “Fantastic,” I mutter, speed-walking to my deskю. “Just fucking fantastic.” By noon, I’m pretty sure my soul has vacated the premises. Probably in the Caribbean drinking fruity cocktails and laughing at my life choices. Twelve-page report compiled from sources that didn't exist until I created them? Check. Lunch meeting cancelled five minutes after confirmation, requiring apology calls to three executives who think I'm clinically insane? Check. Presentation reorganized for a client that materialized like corporate magic? Double check with existential crisis. Then comes the executive luncheon. Crown jewel of corporate torture. I'm balancing espresso shots like I'm defusing a bomb—which, given the collective net worth in this room, I basically am. Hands shaking from exhaustion, three energy drinks that were definitely a mistake, and constant low-level panic that's become my baseline emotional state. A boardroom full of men in suits costing more than my entire existence. They're discussing quarterly projections with the casual intensity of people planning world domination. Almost to the conference table when Patricia appears like a corporate ninja. Her shoulder bumps mine with precision screaming ""accident"" while being anything but. ""Oops."" The word drips fake innocence. Tray tilts. Time slows to that special catastrophic slow motion where your brain catalogs every way this could go wrong while being powerless to stop it. Cups clatter like a ceramic symphony of doom. Dark coffee arcs through air in perfect trajectory, defying gravity just long enough for me to appreciate its mathematical beauty. Lands squarely down some board member's ivory blazer that probably costs more than my annual salary. Silence. The horror-movie kind where everyone dies next. Every eye swings toward me like I've announced I'm carrying a bomb. Then they turn to Mr. Wolfe. He doesn't even blink or scowl. Just complete indifference, like I'm furniture that's fallen over. ""Clean it up."" Ice-cold voice, not cruel—that requires emotion, just indifferent. Somehow infinitely worse than screaming. I grab napkins with shaking hands, moving on autopilot while my brain processes complete social annihilation. The board member glaring like I've ruined his genetic line. Patricia watching with barely concealed glee. Mr. Wolfe's already moved on. Talking Shanghai numbers like nothing happened. Like I don't exist. Later, in the elevator, I'm jabbing the close button like it owes me money when a hand shoots through the gap with reflexes suggesting athletic training or really good genetics. Mr. Wolfe steps in and suddenly the elevator feels coffin-sized. He's close enough I can smell cedar and something indefinitely masculine that makes my brain go inappropriately fuzzy. ""Do you always fold under pressure, Ms. Hartwell?"" His voice is quiet. The dangerous kind of quiet that makes smart people very nervous. ""I was multitasking between your four emergencies while trying not to have a complete breakdown,"" I snap, because self-preservation isn't my strength. He steps closer. Not threatening—something else entirely. Something that makes my pulse spike for reasons that have nothing to do with fear. “Interesting.” One word. But the way he says it, looking down at me with those green eyes that seem to see straight through my skull—it’s like he’s cataloging something. Filing away information. The elevator dings. He steps out like we were discussing the weather instead of… whatever the hell that was. “Good night, Ms. Hartwell.” That night, I’m sitting beside Mia’s hospital bed, watching her draw with chunky crayons. She’s focused with that intense concentration only kids achieve, tongue poking out as she perfects her tiger’s stripes. Then she does something that makes me freeze completely. She drums her fingers against the bedside table. Three precise taps, pause. Three more taps, like morse code to the universe. Exactly like Zayden does during meetings when he’s thinking. “Where did you learn that, baby?” She looks up, confused by the tension in my voice that I’m failing to hide. “Learn what, Mama?” “The finger thing. The tapping.” Mia shrugs with casual six-year-old indifference, already turning back to her drawing. “I don’t know. I just do it when I’m thinking hard.”  Wanna know what happens next? 🤭 Read My Boss, My Babydaddy Now! 🍼❤️‍🔥",1,1757125512.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I have always been very apologetic because of the way my father and step-mother treated me. My go-to response for anything (my fault or not) is always ""I'm sorry"". 

I've recently started a new job at a cafe and since I'm new, I'm constantly messing up little things or forgetting things and apologizing for it. Two of my coworkers have told me that I apologize too much and they're both helping me break the habit. One of them is even making me say three good things about myself every time I needlessly apologize to boost my confidence. 

But there is something I'm confused about: when should I say ""sorry""? I've always understood that ""sorry"" means you regret your actions for something you did (purposeful or not). I recognize that there are times I do it for no reason (like if it's honestly someone's fault and definitely not mine). But there are times when I do something wrong, like pour too much milk for a coffee or forget what someone ordered. But even for these, they're saying I don't need to ""be sorry"". I really don't understand what they mean. Am I using the word wrong? 

I've also been told not to say ""sorry"" when it comes to giving condolences to people. Like, my friend is complaining about some relationship drama or sum shit and I'm like ""Oh, I'm sorry about that"" and they're like ""You don't need to be sorry"". It's not like I'm blaming myself for their shit but I just feel bad they have to go through that. Is there a better phrase I should've using?

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a **KBO clash** that’s about to make your Monday morning coffee taste like champagne (or at least better than the Lotte Giants’ recent offense). The **SSG Landers (-1.5, -200)** are favored to stomp the **Lotte Giants (+1.5, +150)** like a boss who just discovered they’re in charge of the company picnic.

**Why SSG Will Win:**

* The Landers’ moneyline sits at **1.54-1.59**, implying bookmakers think they’ve got a **64.9%-68.4% chance** to win. That’s not confidence—it’s a mathematical declaration that Lotte’s lineup is a leaky faucet in a hurricane.
* Their spread odds (-200) suggest they’re expected to win by **2 runs**, which feels generous if their pitching staff’s ERA is still higher than a toddler’s patience.

**Why Lotte Might Shock Us:**

* The Giants’ **+150 to +177** underdog line implies a **35.1%-41.6% chance** to cover the 1.5-

Please, keep in mind this is my first Labubu, I am not very well vursted in Labubu's, but I am doing my best! Now, onto my question.

What is his cannon name? My younger family member said he was Coffee, but I am not finding any cannon Coffee-Labubu's, I only found one named *Toffee*, but according to the pictures and names on the website, my Labubu and Toffee are different.

Mine matching more to Sesame Bean but the tags are different and so are the nose and eyes. Mine has a pink tag labeled ""THE MONSTERS"" with a golden loop and brownish nose, while Sesame Bean has a brown tag and a gray nose.

Is mine a fake labubu, or just made differently?",1,1757125280.0,labubu,5,1.0,False

1n9nwzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1n9nwzn/i_built_a_photofirst_calorie_tracker_marketing/,I built a photo-first calorie tracker. Marketing tips?,"It's late, probably way too late, and my coffee's gone cold again. Just finished up fixing a weird edge case in the photo scanner for my new iOS app. Been thinking a lot about why most food tracking apps feel like such a chore. I mean, after a long day of coding or bouldering, opening MyFitnessPal or something similar felt like homework, every single time. It's the biggest reason I'd ditch calorie tracking eventually, even though I knew it helped me stay on top of things. I just needed something easier, something that didn't break my flow.

So, I started building my own solution, an app focused on the smallest possible action to log a meal. Think snap a photo, confirm, done. The AI actually works surprisingly well; it nails most common meals and gets the calorie count surprisingly accurate when you learn how to take a decent pic. Even estimates olive oil in the pan. The ""invisible"" calories everyone argues about, telling if something looks pan-fried versus grilled. I spent way too long on the UI/UX, probably a classic mistake for a solo founder, but I really wanted the experience to be smooth. Of course, AI isn't perfect, especially with super mixed-up foods, so I built in quick fallbacks like database search, manual input, and barcode scanning. But most of the time, the photo capture works, and it’s genuinely the easiest way I've found to keep up with my diet.

My question for you all, especially fellow iOS developers who've thought about this space: When it comes to everyday apps like this, what matters more to you as a user? 



Also, if you have made consumer apps how did you go about marketing?",2,1757125133.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False
1n9nwp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1n9nwp8/the_worst_body_aches_in_my_life_after_starting/,The worst body aches in my life AFTER starting low histamine diet,"Ok, a bit of a long back story but I’m hoping someone can help… 

35 year old female in BC Canada 

-History of migraines every 6-8 weeks, preceded by cluster headaches 

-History of severe motion sickness. I cannot be a passenger on a vehicle at all ever. Seems to be related to my migraines. A migraine triggers the worst dizziness and I am pretty much comatose with a puke bowl nearby for 12-20 hours 

-History of severe PMDD, and heavy/prolonged menstrual bleeding. Currently I am bleeding heavily upwards of 12 days per month, and spotting for an additional 5-10. So mostly bleeding more often than not. 

-History of unexplained bruising 

-History of restless legs syndrome 

-Mental health history of PTSD from childhood trauma, as well as generalized anxiety and depression 

Current medications:
30mg Mirtazipine 
100mg gabapentin 
.35 mg Norethindrone
100mg reddy-progesterone 
Multivitamin 
Magnesium 
Iron supplement 

So here’s the backstory. I finally got referred to a hematologist and a gynaecologist to try to figure out this bleeding. It has been going on for years. All lab work and endometrial biopsy came back normal. Gynaecologist started me on the mini pill and progesterone about 6 months ago. No change in my bleeding whatsoever. Previously I tried the mirena IUD which also did not change the bleeding. But in terms of medical diagnosis, I’m all clear and there’s no pinpointed reason why I’m bleeding all the time. But I am, and I subsequently feel like shit all the time. 

I also know that my nervous system is in overdrive/constant fight or flight from the PTSD and just general life stress (I have a lot of it). I feel like I’m always “wired.” Add in a bit of depression and the bleeding issues and I just feel exhausted, depleted, sluggish, and awful most days. 

So eventually I decided to try seeing a different doctor because my GP basically shrugs her shoulders and isn’t doing anything to help me feel better. 

New doctor took a very thorough history and had some interesting theories. He thinks it’s possible that I am somewhat histamine intolerant and told me to try a low-histamine diet for a few weeks. He also sent for further lab work which I have not been able to do yet (just due to scheduling conflicts). Notably he is testing my thyroid, homocysteine, and testosterone. He also informed me that I may be somewhat gluten sensitive - my tissue transglutaminase ab was tested years ago and was 5.5 one time and 6.5 another time. My GP never brought this up to me at all. So he also recommended I cut out gluten as a trial to see if anything changes. The underlying reason he thinks I am histamine intolerant is because it can be linked to many of my symptoms such as headaches/dizziness, PMDD and menstrual irregularities, anxiety/mood disorder, and I had a severe case of cold urticaria that lasted for about 2 years and then went away. He said something about methylation and a build up of estrogen in my body which I didn’t fully understand. 

I am now on day 7 of a strict low histamine gluten free diet. I am also on day 5 of having a very mild head cold (slight sniffles and scratchy throat). No fever. But I have THE ABSOLUTE WORST BODY ACHES OF MY LIFE. It feels like every muscle is tense and aching from the top of my spine all the way down and around both hips and into my upper legs. I am in agony. I barely slept last night. I have tried a hot bath, heating pad, voltaren topical gel, and Tylenol (no nsaids due to the low histamine diet). 

Do you think the body aches could have to do with the diet change? Or just a random coincidence? I neeeeeed it to go away it is so painful I am tempted to go to ER. 

Previous to this low histamine and gluten free diet I ate pretty healthy in my opinion. Lots of protein and veggies. The main things I have cut out that were dietary staples for me are coffee, spinach, red and yellow peppers, yogurt, oat milk, occasionally whole grain toast or a granola bar, and peanut butter.

Crack!   
  
My fiancé hit me.  
  
Three minutes ago, I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment, where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.  
  
Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.  
  
Then, Rhys slapped me across the face-hard.  
  
My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire.  
  
It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted, slowly piecing reality back together.  
  
""Are you f\*\*king insane?"" I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.  
  
Rhys's lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute.   
  
""It was just a mug with Catherine's face on it,"" he said, as if my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.  
  
""You have got to be f\*\*king kidding me."" I stared at him in disbelief, my ch\*\*t heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.  
  
For half a second-just half-something like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.  
  
""No, you're the insane one!"" he roared. ""I already agreed to marry you-what more do you want? Catherine's gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!""  
  
His voice trembled with anger. ""She was your sister! She had to leave because of you! And now you're jealous of her? You won't rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?""  
  
The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the s\*\*p.  
  
My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bl\*\*ding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.  
  
I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. ""It wasn't me. I never asked her to leave.""  
  
Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Catherine had left behind a letter.   
  
In it, she said she'd seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to ""let go,"" to ""let him be yours.""  
  
I don't think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it-she told everyone.  
  
No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame, forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.  
  
To my family, it was like I'd been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl-I should've been grateful.   
  
Even if Rhys had st\*\*bed me in the gut, they'd still find a way to excuse it.  
  
It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better I did than Catherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn't protect her fragile pride.  
  
The searing pain on my cheek intensified.  
  
My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat-anger, humiliation, resentment-rose in my throat.  
  
Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision. I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.  
  
I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.  
  
I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart.   
  
Whatever shred of dignity I had left-I couldn't let it be destroyed in front of this man.  
  
Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. ""Clean it up.""  
  
I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I'd heard him right.  
  
""You broke the mug. You clean up the pieces."" His voice was icy, absolute.  
  
He had to be insane.  
  
""No."" I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.  
  
His face tightened, jaw clenched. ""You sure you want to do this?""  
  
""Yes. I said no."" My eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching.  
  
If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.  
  
The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me.   
  
And beneath that fire, I saw something else-disbelief. The once docile little lamb had bared her fangs.  
  
He took a step closer, menace radiating from him. ""Last chance. If you don't obey me, then we-""  
  
""-are over,"" I finished for him, cold and final.  
  
Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still. He hadn't expected me to actually say it.  
  
While he was caught in that moment of confusion, I wrenched my arm free from his grip.   
  
The taste of freedom hadn't yet bloomed in my ch\*\*t when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.  
  
Now.  
  
I spun around without hesitation and raised my hand-sm\*\*k! A resounding s\*\*p landed hard across Rhys's handsome, arrogant face.  
  
The air froze again, thick with silence.  
  
My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce, unprecedented satisfaction.  
  
Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief-not from the pain, but from a world turned upside down.  
  
He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply.  
  
I lowered my hand, lifted my chin, and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile. ""Now we're even.""  
  
Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating h\*\*l.  
  
If I stayed even one more second, I would break down. I'd rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.  
  
Then-thud-I fell.  
  
High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.  
  
Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Bl\*\*d surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.  
  
I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking.  
  
Home. I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this. Away from him.  
  
Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building-only to slam into a wall of mu\*\*le and the in\*\*xicating scent of expensive cologne.  
  
I looked up-and saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room.   
  
He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off, wouldn't just ruin your life-he'd erase your entire existence.  
  
Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.  
  
For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair-my face flushed red instantly.   
  
I snapped myself back to reality.  
  
""Sorry,"" I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.  
  
Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.  
  
No keys.  
  
Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.  
  
Frustration and helplessness surged in my ch\*\*t. I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently. It didn't help-but I needed to let it out.   
  
Why did everyone always choose Catherine?! Hadn't I done enough?  
  
I collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.  
  
Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice-low, smooth, like black velvet-cut through the air behind me.  
  
""Your key.""  
  
Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?  
  
Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare-only to freeze.  
  
Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs-the one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.  
  
""Your key fell,"" he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. ""That's probably why you couldn't find it.""  
  
I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand, my face flushing so hot it could've lit a match.  
  
I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.  
  
It wasn't until my back hit the door that I realized-I hadn't even thanked him.  
  
Great job, Mira. You absolute id\*\*t.  
  
Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.  
  
He lived across from me?  
  
He must have just moved in. With a face like that-and that aura-there's no way I wouldn't have noticed before.  
  
Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You're seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the h\*\*l Rhys just put you through?  
  
No. Absolutely not. All men are tr\*\*h. Always.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat, reminding myself not to be so st\*\*id again.   
  
But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.  
  
I needed ice-for my racing pulse, and more urgently, for the stinging pain on my cheek.  
  
Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang, shrill and sharp.  
  
One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.  
  
Mom.  
  
I couldn't ignore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.  
  
The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air-cold and merciless.  
  
""Mira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now, or you're no longer our daughter!""  
  
I opened my mouth to explain, stunned-but she hung up before I could get a single word out.  
  
I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't earn even a sliver of their love?   
  
And Catherine-she never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect, precious jewel.  
  
Enough.  
  
I thought if I worked hard enough, my family, my fiancé-they would love me.  
  
But that's never going to happen.  
  
I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.  
  
I have to break off this engagement with Rhys-no matter the consequences.  
  
  
Chapter 2 Plan B  
For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.  
  
No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets, and the crushing weight of humiliation.  
  
That s\*\*p from Rhys wasn't just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a s\*\*p across my entire life-one steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing.   
  
It forced me awake. It made me look back on everything I'd ever done to make him notice me, everything I'd done for a fantasy called ""us"" that had never truly existed.  
  
God, where do I even begin?  
  
Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he'd once praised.   
  
My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, ""It's fine-some allergic reactions are worth it.""  
  
Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning how to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain.   
  
He didn't even open the door-just had the receptionist tell me, ""Don't bother next time. I don't like sweets.""  
  
Then there was that night at his friend's dinner party. I forced down oysters-my most hated food-just to seem ""graceful and agreeable.""   
  
I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m. He didn't ask if I was okay. He laughed and said, ""Can't even handle seafood? That's just dramatic.""  
  
But the worst?  
  
That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party.  
  
I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, ""Don't pretend to like things you clearly don't understand.""  
  
And I laughed. I laughed and said, ""You've got such a good memory.""  
  
What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.  
  
He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the ""perfect and untouchable"" Catherine. A cheap stand-in.  
  
I wasn't her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.  
  
I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook. Not because it was funny-but because the pain had gone too deep for tears.  
  
Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn't contacted me again.  
  
A small part of me wondered-did Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he'd done?  
  
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.  
  
And it didn't stop ringing.  
  
For a full five minutes.  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.  
  
Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.  
  
Yvaine Carlisle-my best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me-stood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.  
  
Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed. ""What the h\*\*l happened to you?""  
  
""I'm fine,"" I said, trying to sound casual. She wasn't buying it.  
  
She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.  
  
Then-silence.  
  
Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind. The kind that comes right before something explodes.  
  
""Who hit you?""  
  
""Come inside,"" I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors' attention. That would be mortifying.  
  
Yvaine didn't move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. ""Mira. Who. Hit. You?""  
  
As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.  
  
She didn't flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.  
  
I didn't know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.  
  
""Rhys.""  
  
Yvaine didn't move.  
  
Everyone in Skyline City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn't the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone.  
  
One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation, money, status-he had it all.  
  
Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection-like the ticking of a Rolex.   
  
When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Sc\*\*ch in hand.  
  
People called him arrogant. No one ever called him vi\*\*ent.  
  
That's why, when Yvaine processed what I'd just said, I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.  
  
""No way,"" she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. ""Rhys? Your Rhys? He couldn't have...""  
  
I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant, untouchable good guy.  
  
""It was him,"" I said quietly.  
  
She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. ""Tell me what happened.""  
  
I swallowed. ""I was at his place. I, uh... accidentally broke a mug.""  
  
Her entire body tensed. ""Just a mug?""  
  
I nodded.  
  
Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, ""I swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted, one-of-a-kind family heirloom-""  
  
""It was Catherine's mug.""  
  
Yvaine's hand froze mid-pat.  
  
Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting mu\*\*er.  
  
I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. ""It's over between Rhys and me.""  
  
""Really?""  
  
""Really. Even if the earth split in two and Skyline City sank into the ocean, I wouldn't marry him.""  
  
That stopped her from storming out to commit ho\*\*cide.  
  
""Catherine. That venomous snake-"" Yvaine spat the name like it physically hurt her.   
  
""She's not even here anymore and she's still managing to wreck your life! And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they'd hand her the matches. It's unbelievable!""  
  
I felt like a balloon someone had just popped-deflated, exhausted. That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my ch\*\*t.  
  
I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing I could do about it.  
  
""I'm sorry, Mira.""  
  
Yvaine sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile.   
  
""Actually, I think it's a good thing. At least I found out what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?""  
  
She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. ""Mira, you know no matter what happens, I've got your back.""  
  
Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.  
  
Like a magician, Yvaine reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you'd be like this.  
  
I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.  
  
After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed. What now?  
  
Through the half-open door, I heard her on the phone. I didn't catch every word, but the ones I did hear... were iconic.  
  
""A pile of s\*\*t.""  
  
""Total f\*\*king psycho.""  
  
""Oh, you think that's bad? Wait till I tell you what this vi\*\*ent ba\*\*ard actually did-""  
  
She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.  
  
The way Yvaine so instantly, so fiercely chose me-without hesitation, without question-made my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.  
  
This wasn't something she did lightly. Rhys's family sat at the very top of the food chain-untouchable. And I had no doubt her parents wouldn't be thrilled to see her go up against them.  
  
I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.  
  
Why couldn't my parents love me like that?  
  
Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini'd her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn't mean they forgave my existence.  
  
Let's be honest: the only reason they'd stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys.   
  
That little arrangement somehow elevated me from ""irreparable family di\*\*race"" to ""potential saving grace.""  
  
Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement-and I know how pathetic this sounds-was because I thought maybe I could finally get something Catherine had: a sliver of parental affection.   
  
A crumb of approval.  
  
But now that the engagement was off?  
  
I was disposable again.  
  
Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I'd spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.  
  
They were absolutely capable of that.  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my pillow. What the h\*\*l do I do now?  
  
Unless... I married someone more powerful than Rhys.  
  
The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Skyline City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.  
  
And yet-  
  
A face flashed in my mind.  
  
Three days ago. My new neighbor.  
  
I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking I wouldn't mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.  
  
I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought. I didn't even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.  
  
No. Way too dangerous.  
  
I gr\*\*ned again.  
  
If I hadn't broken that st\*\*id mug, everything might've been okay.  
  
But it wasn't. And it's not. And there's no going back.  
  
F\*\*k! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn't even the one who messed it up?! I sat up-and bam, the door burst open.  
  
Yvaine marched in. ""Sl\*\*p is just going to make you feel worse. We're getting up, and we're going to find a d\*\*k worth loving-one that's better than Rhys's.""  
  
WHAT?!  
  
While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.  
  
Just like that, we were off to Skyline City's most exclusive club-members only.  
  
  
Chapter 3 Rebound Night  
""Is this really necessary?"" I stood at the end of the line, shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt.   
  
I could practically feel it-if I opened my mouth to speak, my un\*\*rwear would be on full display.  
  
""Sweetheart, we paid a fortune to get into this place. Of course we're going all in. Do you not get it?""   
  
Yvaine declared like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.  
  
""But isn't this a little too-"" I didn't even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face like it had a personal vendetta.   
  
I immediately zipped up my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.  
  
Yvaine let out a dramatic gr\*\*an. ""Mira, come on. We're going to a b\*r, not an Arctic expedition.""  
  
""I'm just glad I won't be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks,"" I snapped back.  
  
She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out, gave me a once-over full of disappointment-but said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe-for now.  
  
I'd thought we'd have to wait in line like everyone else. That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Yvaine.  
  
She had zero plans to follow the rules.  
  
With the ease of someone who'd done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer's hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard ch\*\*t like a Bond girl who'd forgotten her martini.  
  
Ten seconds. That's all it took. We were in.  
  
Yvaine was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol-and ethics-in an instant.  
  
And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.  
  
The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of ch\*\*pagne.   
  
I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with an are-you-trying-to-embarrass-me glare from Yvaine.  
  
She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she'd personally hired the man. Regal, effortless, born for this.  
  
I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who'd just woken up from a freezer nap.  
  
Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels.  
  
If I hadn't known each co\*\*tail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might've even convinced myself I was pulling it off.  
  
""Jesus Christ!"" I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just in\*\*lted my entire bloodline.  
  
Yvaine gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. ""Relax. Tonight's on me.""  
  
I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude.  
  
Considering I'd nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.  
  
Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.  
  
It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones, wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.  
  
We found a table near the b\*r and hadn't even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.  
  
Well. He was hard to miss-tall, sculpted features, sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.  
  
He shouldn't be mixing drinks-he should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior's newest fragrance campaign.   
  
Maybe that's why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.  
  
""Two 75s, French br\*\*dy,"" Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Yvaine had already tossed her order at the ba\*\*ender. ""Make it strong.""  
  
And of course, she didn't forget to flash her signature smile-the one that balanced perfectly between s\*\*y and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say ""Oops, didn't mean to flirt.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender reached effortlessly for the g\*n, giving her a half-smile. ""Rough night?""  
  
""More like an engagement-level disaster,"" she said, casually pointing her thumb at me. ""And it's wrapping up real soon.""  
  
I glanced at her. ""Thrilled that my personal life is now public broadcast.""  
  
She patted my hand with mock sympathy. ""Sweetie, this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks.""  
  
Then she turned away and melted into the crowd, flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.  
  
In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep-like a hawk zeroing in on prey-before spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.  
  
""Okay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A: Six-foot-two, hair neater than your ex-fiancé's moral compass, shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream s\*\*y without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or, at the very least, a VIP card.""  
  
I shook my head. ""Nope.""  
  
Her eyes flicked to a new direction. ""Exhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn't happened yet, but he's hot enough you'd forgive him. You'd fund his next album and still sl\*\*p like a baby.""  
  
""Pass.""  
  
She sighed, then pointed again. ""Fine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes-but the good kind. Like 'books your doctor's appointment and your breakfast' dad, not 'calls the waitress 'sweetheart' and thinks climate change is a myth' dad.""  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my hands. ""Yvaine, please.""  
  
She didn't back down. ""Mira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds.""  
  
Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.  
  
Then, far too casually, she said, ""Hey, want to hit the bathroom?""  
  
I narrowed my eyes. ""No?""  
  
""...Or maybe let's move tables? The vibe here's weird."" Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.  
  
Weird vibe? We'd only been sitting for ten minutes, and we just ordered drinks. By Yvaine's standards, we hadn't even made it past the opening credits.  
  
Then I followed her gaze.  
  
A half-private booth.  
  
Rhys.  
  
He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.  
  
I didn't need more details.  
  
That face-I would never forget it.  
  
Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances.   
  
I, in all my na?ve glory, believed she had simply ""stepped aside,"" choosing to selflessly walk away from a future with Rhys.  
  
And now, here was Catherine-perched on my ex-fiancé's lap, locked in a pose so in\*\*mate.  
  
I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We'd broken up. It was done. Time to move on.  
  
Until I heard what came next.  
  
""Honestly, I didn't think she'd fall apart over a coffee mug.""  
  
Catherine's voice was soft, full of false pity-the kind that sounded like she'd just k\*\*led someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.  
  
She gently swirled the w\*\*e in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile.   
  
""Of course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice. After all, she still doesn't know you've been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint, wasn't it?""  
  
She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration.   
  
""Honestly though, darling, your performance was spot-on. Even I almost believed you were worried she'd find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene.""  
  
""She's so st\*\*id-of course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your af\*\*ir.""  
  
Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. ""I had to act like I cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn't compete with you, she'd lose it.""  
  
Catherine laughed under her breath and patted his ch\*\*t.  
  
""Don't worry. Knowing Mira, she's probably still scrambling to fix things. She's the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth.""  
  
Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a bl\*\*e.  
  
""But the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just 'happened' to return home. Her parents don't know a thing. They didn't even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I'll be seeing them in broad daylight-because she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless.""  
  
Catherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. ""Isn't this the best ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside.""  
  
Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. ""You're right. You always are.""  
  
A loud roar rang in my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.  
  
Yvaine must've been saying something-pleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything st\*\*id-but I didn't hear a word.  
  
I wasn't the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.  
  
I slipped free from Yvaine's grip and turned to the bartender. ""Your best red. Put it on Rhys Granger's tab.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender-bless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul-didn't even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I'd just ordered mineral water.  
  
With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular, burning purpose.  
  
The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face-like a vengeful goddess straight from h\*\*l-made him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.  
  
I marched straight toward Rhys and Catherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.  
  
I raised the bottle-and smashed it, with all my strength.  
  
Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys's forehead split instantly, a trail of bl\*\*d beginning to drip down between his brows.  
  
Catherine screamed and leapt off his lap. ""Mirabelle?! Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!""  
  
She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice. ""You're misunderstanding, it's not what you think-""  
  
Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm, his gaze dark and cold. ""Don't bother explaining, Catherine. It doesn't matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We're just correcting an old mistake.""  
  
Catherine's panic twisted into smugness in an instant. She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed, ""Oh, honey, your head's bl\*\*ding. We have to get to the hospital.""  
  
Before I could say anything, Yvaine rushed to my side, fury radiating from every pore.   
  
She raised her hand, ready to s\*\*p Catherine straight back to whatever pit she'd crawled out of. ""You disgusting, two-faced bi\*\*h-!""  
  
I grabbed her wrist, steady and cold. ""Yvaine, let them go. If they stay here one more second, I might lose my appetite permanently.""  
  
I locked eyes with Catherine's smug little face and raised my voice deliberately. ""After all, the theme of this place is premium taste, not some clearance aisle for secondhand tr\*\*h.""  
  
Catherine's smile froze on her lips. Rhys's face darkened, but they had no chance to respond.  
  
Yvaine, emboldened, lifted her chin and sneered at the bouncers. ""Well? What are you waiting for? Kindly es\*\*rt these two walking health code violations off the premises.""  
  
  
Chapter 4 Key Guy  
As soon as they were gone, Yvaine dragged me out of the club.  
  
D\*\*n it. I hated that Catherine had predicted every single thought running through my mind.  
  
Yes, I was still considering salvaging my relationship with Rhys.  
  
But now? The truth was right there, unmistakable and r\*w-they'd been sl\*\*ping together behind my back all along.   
  
And me? I was just the fo\*\*ish, unnecessary third wheel in their twisted little story.  
  
What I couldn't figure out was-why had Catherine faked her disappearance four years ago? What exactly had she been hiding? And why come back now?  
  
My eyes stung. I tilted my head toward the sky, forcing the tears back.  
  
Fine. Catherine's back. Perfect. Now they could all reunite like a happy little four-piece family?, and I... I was finally free.  
  
""Mira... I'm so sorry. I had no idea they'd be there tonight. I didn't even know Catherine was back."" Yvaine's eyes were full of regret.  
  
I gave a bitter laugh and shook my head. ""Neither did I. But I heard it loud and clear-they've been screwing around for a while. To them, I was just in the way.""  
  
""Those godd\*\*n as\*\*oles!"" Yvaine hissed through clenched teeth.   
  
""You should tell your parents. Let them know Catherine's not the perfect angel they think she is. What about Rhys's parents? No way they'll tolerate a scandal like this.  
  
I was quiet for a moment. Yvaine had a point-Rhys's parents were the only people who had supported me.   
  
But he was their son. They wouldn't choose me over him. Not in the end.  
  
And my parents? I let out a breath, heavy and tired. ""You know better than anyone-they only care about Catherine. No matter what I do, I'll never replace her.""

1n9nv8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/goosecreekcandles/comments/1n9nv8i/help/,HELP!☕️🕯️,"Hi friends, I am fairly new to GooseCreek...I've placed about 3 orders so far, but have browsed the site religiously and have memorized the scent notes for just about each candle LOL. Somehow, I never came across Sweet Espresso until a few weeks ago...never saw it before that. I ordered it as soon as I saw it (I LOVE coffee scented candles). Now, it's gone from the site so I'm guessing it's discontinued. Can someone provide any insight as to seasonal releases, core candles that never leave, etc.? It does show on the candle's page that it's out of stock and it gives an option to be notified when it's back in stock. Someone PLEASE tell me that it's just temporarily out of stock and will be back soon. (The reason I think it MAY just be temporarily out of stock is because other seasonal candles that have sold out just don't show up anymore...they don't have an option for ""Notify when back in stock.) If you've read this far, thank you...you're a saint! LOL

BTW, if you enjoy straight up coffee scents, this one's for you. It is SO strong...I smelled it as soon as I opened the box (and there were 8 other candles in it.) Throw is 100/10!

‼️Edited to add: I cannot find the listing for this candle anymore...:( Only the wax melts.

1n9ntzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1n9ntzh/barkbound/,Barkbound,"Warmth woke me—a loving, squeezing warmth on my arm. My eyes peeked open to see my father nose-to-nose with me, his coffee-scented breath harsh as he whispered. I stared blankly, knowing he expected action, not words. At one year old, doctors noticed I was different, developing slower—struggling to sit up or keep my head steady. But Dad, who refused to let me linger in bed’s bliss, worked with me daily, making me stronger, smarter, more independent. Independence was his recent obsession, especially for this trip with me and my older brother, Charlie, to the new cabin. Charlie, my motivation, was already devouring chocolate chip pancakes while I hadn’t started. He’s the best big brother, always helping, like loading the car with camping supplies and securing my purple plushy elephant—strapped in the backseat for “safety”—which I’d have forgotten, causing a meltdown like last year. Dad’s cringy announcement interrupted my pancake battle, and Mom ushered away our dishes, planting long forehead kisses.


“Behave and listen to your dad; he’s got lots to teach you,” she said sweetly, guiding us to the garage.


I climbed into Dad’s car, clutching my elephant, careful on the slippery side rails. Mom gave me a final “smooch for the road” before turning to Charlie.


“Char—” she began.

“Honey, Charlie knows how to operate,” Dad interrupted, smiling at Charlie.


“I’ll text when the boys can’t stop raving about their cool dad,” he added.


Mom laughed. “Okay, okay. Boys, you little men, make sure Dad remembers his radio is in the glove box. We don’t need him searching for service in an emergency.”


We nodded, assuring her. After her final smooches, we waved as Dad pulled out, our boys’ adventure beginning.

The drive was a blur of naps, interrupted by Dad’s awful rendition of “Carry On Wayward Son,” butchering the lyrics despite knowing the song forever. The road grew bumpy, like climbing Everest.


“Boys, we’re here!” Dad announced, glancing at me in the rearview. “I know someone’s looking forward to Dad’s famous s’mores! This cabin has a bigger fire pit and a creek for swimming.”


My smile widened as we piled out. While Dad unloaded, Charlie and I raced to the cabin door, stopping when he noticed notches in the frame with years etched beside them. Dad, huffing from carrying bags, joined us.


“Well, I assume these are from the previous owners,” he said, patting my head. “We did this when I was little. The notches track how much you grow each year.”


Charlie nodded, grabbing bags to help. “This place must be pretty old then, huh, Dad? Some of those dates go back to the ’20s.”


Dad chuckled. “My great-great-grandfather built this place with his own hands. It’s been a big part of our family until my grandfather lost it to the bank. New owners came, but it’s back on the market—cheap—so Mom and I decided to start a new tradition!”

He made a sudden ‘wild man’ yell, making us jump and giggle. Inside, the dusty cabin felt untouched for a decade. I dropped my bag, determined to claim the biggest room before Charlie could call dibs. I checked every door, but the last one had a rusty lock.


“Hunter, we’re not using that room,” Dad warned. “Auntie May said the floor was weak, so she closed it up last time she was here. I don’t want my nephews getting hurt.”


Nodding, I claimed the next biggest room, plopping my elephant on the bed like an astronaut staking the moon.

Morning brought the smell of bacon, maple syrup, eggs, and toast. I glanced at the now-still trees before joining Dad in the kitchen.


“Hey, Hunter, did you sleep good last night?” Dad asked. “I’m thinking today we go fishing. If the day warms up, maybe you and Charlie can take a dip!”


I grinned, scarfing eggs as Dad yelled down the hallway for Charlie. We grabbed our rods and headed to the wide, shallow creek. Charlie’s lucky hat worked magic—he caught four trout. Dad snagged only a rubber bait for his collection. I caught a crawfish but didn’t mind, collecting shiny rocks until my pants sagged. Dad’s phone rang, startling us.


“It’s just Mom,” he laughed, stepping away. “We forgot to call her yesterday.”


Charlie rustled my hair. “Are you finding any cool rocks, Hunter?”
I showed him my multicolored haul. He pointed into the creek. “That looks like a super unique one!”


He retrieved a triangular rock with a hole in the center, soaking his sleeve. I hugged him tightly, slipping it into my shirt pocket. As Dad talked, I noticed the tree bark shift, revealing the hole I remembered. I waved at Charlie, but it stopped. Uneasy, I pointed, and he questioned me—rocks? Ferns? Birds fleeing?


Finally, he guessed the tree. “Hunter, it’s just a big ol’ tree,” he said, crossing the creek. “It even has a really cool hole in the side. Maybe we can make it into a little treehouse!”


The sky darkened as clouds hid the sun. Charlie climbed into the hole. “Hunter, you should come over here! This would really make a cool tree hou—”


I froze as the bark sealed over him, blending perfectly, like the hole never existed. I grabbed his hat and ran to Dad, who was returning. Tears streaming, I shoved the hat at him, pointing across the creek.

“What’s the matter, where is Charlie?” Dad demanded, yelling into the woods.


After my nods and pointing, he ran across the creek. “Charlie, come back! This isn’t funny!” he shouted.


Ten minutes later, his voice hoarse, he returned. “Hunter, wait here and watch for Charlie. I’m getting the emergency radio to contact search and rescue. Charlie wouldn’t go far; he doesn’t know these woods.”


He retrieved the radio, already talking. “Yes, ma’am, we need people up here immediately. His name is Charlie, he’s 12 years old, he was with my other son, Hunter.”


The woman spoke, and Dad continued. “No, ma’am, Hunter is non-verbal. He confirmed Charlie went into the woods. I need anyone you can send.”


“They’re on their way, about 20 minutes out?” he said, rubbing his neck. “Okay, thank you, goodbye.”


Dad sent me to flag down the police, who arrived soon after. I led them to the backyard, where Dad detailed Charlie’s disappearance—age, height, clothes, habits, insisting he wouldn’t wander off. He showed a photo from his wallet and led them across the creek. My heart sank—the tree’s hole was wide open again, mocking me. Days of searching found nothing. Mom arrived, frantic, joining Dad and volunteers combing the woods. Two years later, we return annually on the day Charlie vanished, leaving the cabin and his room untouched. I find Mom in his bed, clutching his pillow. I feel Charlie’s energy but avoid the backyard’s ominous trees. Leaving the cabin, I glanced back with fading hope. In the tree’s bark, where the hole was, I saw Charlie’s face—eyes closed, peaceful. A key hung on a tattered rope around the trunk. I said nothing to my parents, who clung to hope. I clutch Charlie’s rock, his hat, and his memory, believing that key holds answers for next year, when I’ll face the tree and unlock its secrets.",1,1757124872.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1n9ntnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n9ntnj/the_most_intense_body_aches_ive_ever_experienced/,The most intense body aches I’ve ever experienced,"Ok, a bit of a long back story but I’m hoping someone can help… 

35 year old female in BC Canada 
-History of migraines every 6-8 weeks, preceded by cluster headaches 
-History of severe motion sickness - I cannot be a passenger on a vehicle at all ever. Seems to be related to my migraines. A migraine triggers the worst dizziness and I am pretty much comatose with a puke bowl nearby for 12-20 hours 
-History of severe PMDD, and heavy/prolonged menstrual bleeding. Currently I am bleeding heavily upwards of 12 days per month, and spotting for an additional 5-10. So mostly bleeding more often than not. 
-History of unexplained bruising 
-History of restless legs syndrome 
-Mental health history of PTSD from childhood trauma, as well as generalized anxiety and depression 

Current medications:
30mg Mirtazipine 
100mg gabapentin 
.35 mg Norethindrone
100mg reddy-progesterone 
Multivitamin 
Magnesium 
Iron supplement 

So here’s the backstory. I finally got referred to a hematologist and a gynaecologist to try to figure out this bleeding. It has been going on for years. All lab work and endometrial biopsy came back normal. Gynaecologist started me on the mini pill and progesterone about 6 months ago. No change in my bleeding whatsoever. Previously I tried the mirena IUD which also did not change the bleeding. But in terms of medical diagnosis, I’m all clear and there’s no pinpointed reason why I’m bleeding all the time. But I am, and I subsequently feel like shit all the time. 

I also know that my nervous system is in overdrive/constant fight or flight from the PTSD and just general life stress (I have a lot of it). I feel like I’m always “wired.” Add in a bit of depression and the bleeding issues and I just feel exhausted, depleted, sluggish, and awful most days. 

So eventually I decided to try seeing a different doctor because my GP basically shrugs her shoulders and isn’t doing anything to help me feel better. 

New doctor took a very thorough history and had some interesting theories. He thinks it’s possible that I am somewhat histamine intolerant and told me to try a low-histamine diet for a few weeks. He also sent for further lab work which I have not been able to do yet (just due to scheduling conflicts). Notably he is testing my thyroid, homocysteine, and testosterone. He also informed me that I may be somewhat gluten sensitive - my tissue transglutaminase ab was tested years ago and was 5.5 one time and 6.5 another time. My GP never brought this up to me at all. So he also recommended I cut out gluten as a trial to see if anything changes. The underlying reason he thinks I am histamine intolerant is because it can be linked to many of my symptoms such as headaches/dizziness, PMDD and menstrual irregularities, anxiety/mood disorder, and I had a severe case of cold urticaria that lasted for about 2 years and then went away. He said something about methylation and a build up of estrogen in my body which I didn’t fully understand. 

I am now on day 7 of a strict low histamine gluten free diet. I am also on day 5 of having a very mild head cold (slight sniffles and scratchy throat). No fever. But I have THE ABSOLUTE WORST BODY ACHES OF MY LIFE. It feels like every muscle is tense and aching from the top of my spine all the way down and around both hips and into my upper legs. I am in agony. I barely slept last night. I have tried a hot bath, heating pad, voltaren topical gel, and Tylenol (no nsaids due to the low histamine diet). 

Do you think the body aches could have to do with the diet change? Or just a random coincidence? I neeeeeed it to go away it is so painful I am tempted to go to ER. 

Previous to this low histamine and gluten free diet I ate pretty healthy in my opinion. Lots of protein and veggies. The main things I have cut out that were dietary staples for me are coffee, spinach, red and yellow peppers, yogurt, oat milk, occasionally whole grain toast or a granola bar, and peanut butter.

### Intro

I have at previous points in my life been locally competitive but not since 2017, which despite being just last year was *actually* 8 years, 2 kids, and 1 lifetime ago. I think I averaged less than 10 mpw in 2024 so I made something of a new years resolution to run 5k/day for January and although I fell two days short, it lit something inside me which hadn’t burned since 2017. I’ve long had a goal of running sub 3 and doing Boston, and at various times have been in good enough shape to, but never did. In March, I decided to make 2025 about that goal.

### Training

Obviously 10 mpw won’t get me to Boston, so the first thing I did was increase mileage. Which my right soleus did NOT like. And then, after a ~month of slow recovery, my left soleus decided it wasn’t much of a fan either, although was more reasonable, only requiring ~2 weeks of recovery. So it turns out you shouldn’t jump from <10 to >40 mpw in 3 months, weird. After focusing on leg and specifically calf strength with lots of leg presses, squats, calf raises, and box jumps, I feel like I’m back in business, and was able to spend the last 5 weeks in the 36-46 mpw range with no issues.

I’ll run the Museum of Aviation Marathon in late January 2026 so my new and improved Pfitz v4 18/55 starts at the end of September. With that in mind, I’ve been trying to find my current fitness to gauge paces, so I tried a couple of indicator-type workouts as well as a local 5k. Something supremely stupid always happened preventing me from feeling like I did a representative effort, most notably an asthma flare up (that I apparently did NOT outgrow) during the 5k. The best indicators of my fitness leading into MLDRR were a [28 min semi-hilly LT run](https://www.strava.com/activities/15357790544) at ~6:30 where I felt like I nailed “comfortably hard” and an [asthma-limited 18:58 5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/15557588567).

So yeah, I really didn’t have a great feel for where I was fitness wise for this race. VDOT and Pfitz guessed mid-18 with from LT run, Garmin guessed 18:20 for whatever that’s worth, I actually ran an 18:58, and I felt like I could run low-18, maybe 18 flat. In spite of loving the MLDRR and wanting to run my fastest, I just kept training for marathon training, logging a good number (for me) of miles and doing leg strength exercises without much of a break outside of a short recovery from the local 5k and a 3 day taper.

This being a net downhill race (average 70 ft/mi drop), I decided I would target 5:45 (17:50 finish) for the first mile which has the largest drop before adjusting my pace based on how I felt.

### Pre-race

My parents live 30 min from the start line and I’ve been doing this race for years, heck my dad has been doing this race for years, I even had the dubious privilege of losing to someone who used to beat my dad when he was my age! Spoiler: I did not win. So me, my wife, and our two kids drove down the day before and spent the night. The 5k starts at 7:30, so I woke up at 5, made coffee, had half an english muffin and talked with my dad who drove me to the start. It felt just like high school!

We arrived at 6:30 for packet pickup, I talked to my dad a bit more, took some caffeine and beet root pills, puffed my new Rx inhaler, and he drove to the finish before they closed the road down at 7, leaving with a “run like you stole something!” I did ~2 miles for my warm up, finishing with strides and heavy legs. My legs always feel heavy before the gun goes off though, and they always feel good afterward, but there’s that fear that they won’t magically feel better...

I line up in the second row, not trying to bait myself into thinking I’m faster than I am, then start to wonder WHEN DID EVERYONE GET SUPER SHOES!!?! I mean, dang. Just before the gun an old dude with a beer belly lined up in front of me so I was a bit pissed, but then he starts talking to the future female winner next to me saying he’s targeting 17:30 (he pretty much did, props to him). I’m sure this guy is partly just way faster than he looks but I’m also convinced his Vaporflys had rocket boosters in the back or something. But after I noticed his, I noticed that seemingly everyone else at the front had super shoes too. My Kinvara 7’s with a couple hundred miles suddenly felt inadequate.

### Race

The gun goes off and it’s more chaotic than usual. I got pressured from behind and accidentally clipped the ankle of the person ahead of me, fortunately he was able to stay upright and his shoe stayed on. I sprinted ahead just to avoid the confusion which I had not planned to do. Slowing after the start is always hard for me, I unfortunately tend to positive split, especially 5ks, so I made a very conscious effort to ease back after the lightning start. The leaders looked ridiculous, even the overambitious middle school group can’t keep up. These guys are moving and fast, which is honestly great because it meant I never had delusions of grandeur or false hope of keeping up with them.

The first mile goes by and I reluctantly glance at my watch, not wanting to see where I’m at: 5:29. So, much faster than I targeted, but also I feel good? I don’t feel the need to adjust my effort and assume my next mile will be about 6 with the Forsyth Hill staring me in the face. Although the race is net downhill the Forsyth Hill is pretty significant, rising 50+ ft over 1/2 mile, nothing killer, but an abrupt change from the previous mile. In 2007 I was running with the front group when I took the lead going up and forced a sizeable gap to the pursuers, but fatigue really set in at the top and they reeled me back in over the next mile, all of them passing me with 1/2 mile to go which was just brutal. So lesson learned: even effort, don’t be a hero. I did a pretty good job of keeping the effort up the hill, passing one or two people, but I let my mind wander after cresting, you can even see it in my HR data. I estimate I lost 5 seconds just by not staying focused.

When my watch dinged it was a wake up call, realizing I’d daydreamed the last 1/4 mile since going over the top, although I managed to pull off a 5:39 in spite of that and the hill. I’m starting to feel it at this point, a good bit of pain and I’m not not entirely controlled but still “within myself.” The next mile isn’t technical or anything, but there are a lot more turns which makes it tough when you have to slow and accelerate out of them to get back to your main pace. Over the first 1/4 mile here I kept pushing and picked off another runner, but then it’s like I went back to sleep again until a different runner I hadn’t seen since the start zoomed past me at 2.5 miles. The rate he passed me was shocking and re-woke me up and I was able to push through to the finish, being limited only by pain. But there was indeed a lot of pain.

I didn’t look at my watch at mile 3 (but you can, dear reader: 5:39), at that point my attention was only on the finish, but man I did NOT have a kick left in me. I was only 2 seconds behind passing one more person in front but just couldn’t, which is extremely unlike me. I’ve always had a good finishing kick but I was simply zonked from a hard race and didn’t have enough pop in my legs from the focus on quantity over quality in the build.

### Post-race

17:18!! Can’t be mad at that. I was expecting splits of 5:45, 6:00, 5:45 good for 18:07, so averaging 15 s/mile and almost a full minute overall improvement feels great. I think I left a few seconds on the course by zoning out twice, maybe 10 total, but also feel like I left it all out there as evidenced by not having a finishing kick. After laying on the grass for a few minutes I find my wife and kids who are with my mom and dad. The kids seem excited to see runners, aren’t fighting, and have doughnuts that my dad grabbed on his way to the finish, so it’s a good morning for all. There’s a truck serving Michelob Ultra which tastes much better at 8 am than 8 pm.

The MLDRR still has the large easel where they print out and tape results, evoking fantastic XC memories, more races should do this. 18th overall, which is about where I expect, but managed 1st in M30-34!! That part was very unexpected. Last week I was 7th overall in my asthma 5k but 5th in age... So we stuck around for the medal and I again got to sneak peaks at the shoes of the runners who beat me and I’m again left wondering, when did everyone start wearing super shoes? I was planning to grab a pair for my marathon but didn’t realize how prevalent they had become. I’m left wondering how much time I could’ve shaved off my time, and also wondering if this is why I’m in 18th with a low 17. This race has always been fast, attracting practically all of the fast people in central Georgia, but low 17 used to be top 10 for sure. Now, top 10 is mid 16, which is about 4% faster, which matches the advertising from Nike quite conveniently...

### What's Next?

I’m using the next 4 weeks before 18/55 to eke out extra miles and do more strength work. I hope to average 50+ mpw with one LT, one heavy strength, and one LR session for each of these weeks. I haven’t done a Pfitz full Mary plan before, but he ripped my limbs off one by one and mercilessly beat me with them when I did his Faster Road Racing 5k plan for MLDRR 8 years, 2 kids, and 1 lifetime ago in 2017. I hobbled my way through to the end, posting a PR of 15:47, but felt like my body would’ve taken the intensity of the plan much better if I had a stronger base. So I’ll try to enter 18/55 a bit stronger and with a larger base, and who knows, once this marathon is over maybe I’ll use his 5k plan again to try and take 1:30 off my 5k and challenge that 15:47 at MLDRR next year, 9 years, 2 kids, and 1 lifetime later.

1n9nqak,https://i.redd.it/mkojdtngdgnf1.jpeg,Avoiding Fellow Stagg EKG Kettle in particular and the company in general,"The quick take away about my experience with Fellow:
They don’t honor even exchanges for items purchased on sale.
They charge $15 to return items, $30 for bundles
The colors in the pictures are a product of staged lighting and not accurate representations of what the item will look like in your home.
Their quality does not feel made to last for the $200 price tag
They identify on the exterior of the box what is inside it, increasing the likelihood of theft.
Their customer service is tone deaf and unhelpful.

I purchased the kettle during their Labor Day sale and I thought the color looked like a cool green with an airy feel to it. Sadly, the color was more like taupe in the lighting in my apartment, and was more gray than green overall. The color was much more muted than the online photo suggests. When I contacted customer service asking if I could make an even exchange for another color, they gave me this pitiful no accountability response: 
“Regretfully, our upper management team has advised that we cannot make an even exchange because the two colors have two different prices. The $15 return fee cannot be waived unless the customer chooses to return and receive the refund back in the form of store credit. Perhaps if you choose to get refunded back as store credit, you can then purchase the desired color with the store credit and pay the rest of the difference.”
I didn’t care about the $15 return fee, but I’ve never encountered a business that was unable to do an even exchange for an item that was purchased on sale when you are trying to swap it for a color that isn’t a depressing attempt at green.
Furthermore, they didn’t update me on the shipment of my kettle until the day after it had arrived. I think it is a dubious practice to have a box with a sticker on the outside listing exactly what’s inside of the box - possibly a way the company increases box thefts and leaves you on the hook to pay for it while encouraging people to pay the $4 package insurance.
Because they charge such high premiums for equipment that has longevity issues to begin with, and their customer service response is so tone deaf, I will discourage anyone thinking that Fellow is the brand to pick for quality coffee items. I would not purchase anything from them again with the policies they have, and hope that others don’t get fooled by their marketing strategies like me. Their pictures are deceptive, and the quality of their products is not the highest. You can love them, but the customer service experience and deceptive marketing has killed any desire I have to be part of their community.

Chapter Two – Names in the Margins

Elena told herself not to open the notebook again. She left it on her coffee table, stacked a pile of unopened mail on top of it like the weight of bills and junk advertisements could silence its pull. But by the second night, it was all she could think about.

At midnight, she finally gave in.

The handwriting grew sharper in the later entries. The writer, still unnamed, spoke about Isabel with the kind of detail that couldn’t be invented. The way she chewed her nails until they bled. The way her foster brother used to leave the hallway light on just for her, so she didn’t wake up screaming in the dark.

Then, on the seventh entry, Elena noticed something strange. Scribbled faintly in the margin, half-hidden by ink stains, was a list of names. Not fictional ones, real ones.

Marisol T.

Pastor David R.

Officer McAllen


Elena froze. She knew two of them. Marisol Torres was her mother’s cousin, someone who came to family barbecues every summer. And Pastor David R.? He ran the same church her aunt had dragged her to for Christmas service last year.

Her pulse kicked up.

The entry itself described Isabel’s “silent witnesses”, people who saw what was happening to her, who nodded, prayed, shook hands, and then looked the other way.

Elena’s throat dried out as she read the last line of that entry:

“They all knew. That’s the part that rots your bones, how many people knew and still said nothing.”

She slammed the journal shut. For the first time since finding it, she considered throwing it away, dropping it into the dumpster behind her apartment, letting it burn with the trash.

But then, her phone buzzed. A new text.

From an unknown number.

 “Don’t go further. Some things are better left unread.”

Elena stared at the screen, her stomach dropping into ice. She hadn’t told anyone about the journal. She hadn’t even posted online about it.

In one of those conversations a few months ago, I floated the idea of allocating 50% of all revenue from this project to the official Kendu treasury, but in recent days I’ve decided to bump that up to a cool 60%. Also, I know this post ended up way longer than I expected, but there was a lot to cover and I wanted to really lay out the case for why I think this project will play a role in helping us get out of our current lull marketcap-wise.***

Hey Chads and Chadetts,

To dive straight into things, as a dev that’s been part of this community since pretty much the beginning, I’ve floated all sorts of ideas here, some of which have made some inroads while others have stayed on the on the drawing board. I did a whole [series of detailed posts about a year back](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1fz23bh/bringing_utility_by_getting_kendu_listed_on_more/) on how we can bring more utility to the ecosystem based on past experience. When the Wormhole launched, I found a [nice way to package it](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1hsb6fs/in_the_lead_up_to_the_solana_bridge_launching_we/) for those new to the ecosystem, and the posts I made on it in various subs ended up having a good amount success. When the CTO happened, [it only made me more committed to longer-term Kendu projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1i58g8y/miazaki_leaving_was_a_good_start_but_time_to_make/), which eventually led to what’s being launched today. Even before this going live, it has arguably already had impact on the ecosystem as several other Kendu-related projects have also recently got onboard with the “pledge X% of project revenue to the Kendu treasury” model that I’ve been advocating for.

Now getting to the crux of this project, one of the things I suggested back in January was Snapshot voting now that we are a CTO. Josh dropped by in the [thread that I made on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1id11u3/nonbinding_snapshot_governance_for_token_holders/) and raised some very good counterpoints, and I actually agreed with much of it. Rather than completely abandon the idea, however, I went back and refined it and thought a lot on how it can be implemented more carefully so that it’s on a sort of “rails” to avoid some of the issues he mentioned. For those not familiar with Snapshot, a pretty good description [can be found on their site](https://snapshot.box/#/about), but it’s essentially a simple UI for gasless voting that is used by [tons of crypto projects](https://snapshot.box/#/explore).

The reason why I’ve long been adamant that something like Snapshot would be massively beneficial to Kendu goes beyond just the obvious things that I’ve brought up before. Being part of this community for a while, one thing that I’ve consistently noticed is that there is often a “coordination failure” of sorts, despite our impressive numbers here and on other platforms. Trying to coordinate efforts through Reddit posts or TG messages will always play a central role, but also has some limitations. For one, it has a tendency to be ephemeral as threads here quickly get buried and the pace on TG is obviously very fast. There’s ways to counter some of this, like stickying threads, but you can only sticky so many threads or pin so many comments, and people that only drop in once a week or so tend to not be able to keep up with everything. Even if proposals on Snapshot are not binding, **just having our campaigns / areas of focus neatly organised in a more permanent setting, with voting to gauge community sentiment around each one, is something that is difficult to do effectively on Reddit or TG**.

To be clear, this will **not** be structured like a DAO, where proposals are made for sweeping changes to Kendu itself (Josh already pointed out the issues with this in the earlier mentioned thread), but rather, a way to vote around sustained campaigns or longer-term initiatives to focus on. Given that Kendu is a brandcoin, a basic example that I can think off the top of my head would be a proposal being put forward to focus efforts on publicly propping up specific part of the ecosystem (e.g Energy, Coffee etc) for some period of time. Another example would be voting around how best to approach a competition that we’re trying to come out on top of. Proposals can be quite detailed, and it’s just a very purpose-built tool for this sort of thing.

**I think having this in place will be useful to such an extent that it will eventually have a positive effect on the charts once it starts to lead to more effective coordination**. Someone can make a proposal on how to direct our efforts, the community can express their level of enthusiasm by voting (which again, is just a way to gauge sentiment rather than having it be binding), and we can put in a *sustained* effort on a specific campaign, even complex ones that last multiple months. Snapshot keeps the proposals and votes on the blockchain, so we don’t have to worry about threads disappearing or getting lost anymore (and despite everything being stored onchain, it’s still gasless and completely free to use).

To reiterate, I’m not in any way suggesting this is going to *replace* coordinating on Reddit or TG, but rather *enhance* it by allowing us to keep the best stuff that comes up in our discussions on Reddit/TG in a less ephemeral and more structured medium. You might now be getting a sense of why I’ve been such a proponent of something like this for some time now.

Now, when I set out work on a Snapshot implementation, it pretty quickly became clear that it would make a lot of sense to combine this with another long-standing issue in the community I’ve been trying to address and effectively hit two birds with the one stone. Like many of you here, I got burned with the Chads NFTs a while back, not only as a holder, but as someone that also runs an unrelated project that was set to be one of the first to launch a collection on the Chads Marketplace until the Marketplace itself got canned (you might remember the posts I made about this last year).

Some of you picked up a fair bit more Chads NFTs than I did and ended up getting hit a lot worse, so addressing this has always been in the pipeline. I hinted at this in a bunch of posts here and also had some brief discussions over DM a few months back with some other well-known members here that hold Chads.

This has become a lot more feasible since the CTO and the greater emphasis on permissionless IP, as Kendu is now much more decentralised and so it’s not so much about splitting hairs over what constitutes as “official” or “unofficial” anymore, but what the community ends up putting its weight behind.  At the very least, the line between the two have been greatly blurred, and as mentioned 60% of the revenue from this project is going straight to the Kendu treasury wallet in any event.

One thing that has been absolutely clear from the outset, though, is that a new Kendu NFT set must largely be community-run with a high degree of holder input to steer its direction. There were hard lessons to be learned from the original Kendu Chads and we need to make sure we keep them in mind. Outside of just making it community-first, it also means that we have to avoid basing the project around some *future* utility (e.g. In the case of the original Chads, it was the Marketplace and revenue-sharing). In other words, the best way to implement this is to make sure most of the core parts are ready from the beginning.

**To recap everything so far: I’ve been working on a project for several months that not only implements non-binding Snapshot voting to coordinate campaigns now that we’re a CTO, but addresses the Chads issue at the same time by allowing Chad holders to buy-in at a very low cost over other wallets. Holders of this new collection will be able to participate in Snapshot voting in two ways: a binding form to steer the NFT project itself, and in a completely non-binding form for the wider Kendu ecosystem, mainly as a way for the community to coordinate specific initiatives. 60% of all revenue from the project will automatically directly go the official Kendu treasury.**

And though anyone can start another Kendu Snapshot space in the future with broader eligibility criteria, in order to reduce the chance of infiltration and malicious proposals being pushed this one is going lean more on the old guard as there is incentives to get onboard for those that hold Chads (or have held them in the past). Those newer to Kendu are still welcome to join, but because of the way it’s structured, I expect the distribution to lean more towards people that have been involved with Kendu for some time. The way I see it is like different battalions in an army, each one with slightly different cultures and different strengths and weaknesses. Anyone can start another Snapshot space (battalion), but this one has a distinct character with specific aims in mind, with some some safeguards in place in the form of incentives.

Now with all that out of the way, this is how the project is structured to allow it to be sustainable over the long-term:

* An initial phase, running for about a week, where existing Chad NFT holders can buy-in at a *heavily* discounted price of approx. 0.006 ETH (\~$27 as of the time of writing).
* A public phase following the initial phase, where anyone can pick them up for around 0.024 ETH (\~$110). Keep in mind the original Chads were being minted for the equivalent of \~$500 at the time, if my figures are right, so this is just a fraction of that.
* The entire collection will be limited to just 410 items.
* As mentioned earlier, 60% of every sale will directly go to the official Kendu treasury, which is something that I floated with Josh a few months back and got the go-ahead for. This will essentially occur automatically after every mint using an audited payment splitter smart contract, requiring no action on my end (to be pedantic, as smart contracts cannot actually self-execute, it means that funds will accumulate in it until *any* wallet (even a burner one) comes along and calls the disburse function, which can be done directly on Etherscan with one click).
* A good portion of the remaining 40% will go towards keeping the collection sustainable in the long-term, because ultimately we also want the value of the NFTs to steadily rise.
* Whatever is left over from all that will be going towards medical expenses for a family member, so everything for this project is going towards something useful one way or another.
* As mentioned, there will be Snapshot voting to guide the NFT project itself, and *non-binding* snapshot voting to coordinate Kendu initiatives and to gauge sentiment in the wider ecosystem.
* **In order to kickstart momentum, there will be a distribution of KENDU to those who get onboard early. The total pool will be approx. $350 worth of KENDU and the allocation will be calculated on the basis of when the holder minted their NFTs (i.e., minter #3 will receive a higher distribution than minter #22). The distribution itself will be triggered when 3/4 of the collection has been minted.**

Here’s a little diagram I put together of the main aspects:

https://preview.redd.it/9enzwfdgbgnf1.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=05d444e76cec66fe0290baf37fb345392fdffd2a




The [official site for the project](https://kenduelements.xyz/) also lays out things clearly.

Snapshot voting will go live as soon as there’s enough holders to meet a quorum.

A quick note on the art, as it makes a lot more sense when I explain what I was going for. I went with a “blueprint” theme to symbolise Kendu still being in a nascent stage and very much an open canvas. I then looked for actual pictures from stuff we recognise as part of the ecosystem (Coffee, Energy, graffiti / murals), converted them into a simplified/vibrant forms (not fully manually, but still requires a lot of iteration), and then slowly added the end results to specific surfaces of the polygon. **Keep in mind I’m a dev and not an artist**, and I’m combining the various pieces in GIMP, so it’s proving to be time consuming as I need to repeat this for all 410 items. I could have probably gone a different route, but I wanted the art to have a specialness to it. Again, I’m not an artist, so it’s not the most spectacular looking, but at least it’s meaningful.

This gives a bit of an idea on it’s evolution:

**One last thing: If you held Chads at some time but already sold, send me a DM and I’ll manually add you to the allowlist to mint at the same price as current Chad holders.**

Expert, Lived Experience From Bahrain Financial Harbour to Seef District in 2025\
\
Alt text: Professional Bahrain businesspeople in a corporate meeting. a reliable local consultant who knew the difference between the MOICT and LMRA requirements.\
Terminating an employment contract in Bahrain is as much about relationships and timing as it is about documentation and cost. So whether you’re launching a new business in Seef District or transitioning your corporate structure in the Diplomatic Area, understanding how to navigate legal termination under Bahrain Labor Law is non-negotiable.\
This expert guide presents firsthand strategies, 2025 legal updates, and time-saving shortcuts for Bahrain company formation and contract termination—backed by real experience, not just legal codes.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Growth, Opportunity, and Labor Law Modernization\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.). As foreign direct investment (FDI) swells, more companies are seeking Bahrain company formation in high-profile districts like Bahrain Bay and Seef.\
\
The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported a 15% year-on-year rise in new company registrations in Q1 2025, with legal compliance topping investors’ concerns (Bahrain.com).\
\
Compared to the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain stands out for its streamlined processes (especially post-2022 digitalization of the Sijilat platform), relatively low costs, and a strong culture of direct access to decision makers—even at LMRA or Tamkeen.\
However, labor law compliance is under the microscope now. The updated 2025 LMRA guidelines (effective April 17, 2025) introduced stricter notice period enforcement and mandatory documentation, especially for companies in free zones (Gulf News–Bahrain).\
\
Key Foundations: Bahrain Labor Law & Employment Contract Termination\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.:*\
\
Mutual agreement (documented in writing)\
Completion of contract term (for fixed-term contracts)\
Dismissal for cause (e.g., serious misconduct)\
Redundancy (with conditions)\
Resignation (with correct notice period)\
Force majeure (rare)\
\
Recent update (2025):\
LMRA now requires explicit written evidence for terminations—even by mutual agreement—filed within 1 business day via the new LMRA online portal.\
Notice Periods (2025)\
\
Standard: 30 calendar days (can be longer if specified in contract)\
Probation: 7 days\
Immediate termination: Only for proven gross misconduct, with clear supporting evidence\
\
My personal tip: Always give slightly more notice than contractually required—Bahrain’s business culture values goodwill gestures, which helps avoid disputes.\
\
Step-by-Step: How To Legally Terminate an Employment Contract in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.\
- For redundancy, prepare a business case for LMRA review\
Insider shortcut:\
Draft a standard “termination checklist” template that covers all MOICT and LMRA points. Having this ready saved me both time and face during my last tricky exit.\
2. Notify the Employee In Writing\
\
Deliver a signed notice letter, with witness present in majlis-style meeting (if possible)\
Use dual language (Arabic and English)\
Specify effective termination date, notice period, and entitlements\
\
\
Don’t forget: Ramadan hours or local holidays can slow response times; plan notifications accordingly.\
\
3. Submit Required Notifications to Authorities\
\
Log into Sijilat (Ministry of Industry and Commerce)\
Submit contract termination to LMRA, including all supporting documents\
For expat staff: Cancel work visa, update immigration and Tamkeen if applicable\
\
Time-saving tip:\
Use Bahrain Bay’s LMRA branch—fewer queues than busiest Diplomatic Area location (personal experience: got my paperwork done in 28 minutes instead of 2 hours).\
4. Settle Final Payments and Benefits\
\
Calculate last salary, unused leave, indemnity (end-of-service benefit), and bonuses\
Provide detailed pay slip with breakdown in both Arabic and English\
Issue NOC (No Objection Certificate) if required for next employer\
\
Remember: Delayed settlements can lead to hefty penalties or even travel bans.\
5. Return of Company Property and System Deactivation\
\
Retrieve ID cards, keys, company devices, etc.\
Remove system and account access same day as exit\
Document property return with employee signature\

Cost Considerations: What Does Legal Termination Really Cost in Bahrain?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs. than in neighboring GCC markets.\
\
Document preparation & notary fees: BHD 20–50\
LMRA processing and exit fee: BHD 30–75 per expat\
Accountants/legal advisor: BHD 100–300 (if you use a pro)\
Typical end-of-service benefits: 1/2 month’s salary per year of service, pro-rata for shorter durations\
\
Budget range: Total costs per exit usually run BHD 200–700, depending on complexity and years of service.\
For a deeper breakdown, see Bahrain company formation cost.\
Common mistake: Underestimating settlement costs or forgetting required indemnities—especially for foreign staff. I once failed to account for annual ticket allowances; a small oversight that nearly doubled our exit bill.\

Ownership, Sponsorship, and Related Labor Law Traps\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.). But there are subtle differences:\
\
Sponsor obligations: If operating under a local sponsor, ensure sponsor signs off on contract terminations for expats (local sponsorship guide)\
Free zone firms: Must follow additional notification steps (free zones in Bahrain)\
Ownership structures: Some licenses (esp. in financial sector) require MOICT approval before terminations (business type structures)\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 update now allows 99% foreign ownership in most sectors (ownership update), but don’t neglect labor law basics: contract clarity, timely compliance, and sponsor notification remain critical.\
\
Compliance Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
\
Alt text: Professional business support..\
2. Incomplete paperwork:\
   Always get the employee’s signature on all exit documents. Digital signatures now accepted (as of March 2025).\
3. Skipping accounting adjustments:\
   Update payroll and accounting records before final settlement; mismatches can trigger audits. Reliable partners like Keylink’s accounting services make this seamless.\
Insider Strategy\
Build relationships with MOICT and LMRA staff. A shared Arabic coffee or even just punctual attendance at government offices during early morning hours (7:30–8:30 am) sets a positive tone and can magically speed up bureaucracy—a detail that outsiders often underestimate.\
\
Regulatory Update 2025: Stricter Documentation for Contract Terminations\
On April 17, 2025, Bahrain implemented a new LMRA policy:\
- All contract terminations must be filed within 1 business day\
- Digital uploads of signed notice and exit settlement documents are required\
- Failure to comply may result in immediate business fines and employee protection measures\
This means you must prepare notice letters and settlement calculations before the termination meeting—no more “fix it later” flexibility.\
\
(I learned this the hard way during a Ramadan exit last year—delays cost us BHD 250 in LMRA fines and two stressful trips to the Diplomatic Area branch.)\
\
\
The Personal Side: Business Culture and Human Touch in Bahrain\
Majlis-style meetings, especially in company headquarters or traditional settings, remain a cornerstone of Bahraini business etiquette—even for tough conversations like contract terminations. Politeness, tea/coffee service, and allowing the employee to “save face” are just as important as paperwork.\
During Ramadan, expect shorter workdays and slower official responses. Plan exits at least two weeks before Eid to avoid bottlenecks.\
Networking remains more open here than in Saudi Arabia or the UAE. In my experience, a friendly relationship with Sijilat or Tamkeen officials can solve problems that would become formal disputes elsewhere.\
\
A Tangent on Business Structure: Why Choose Bahrain for Company Formation?\
At first glance, this might seem unrelated—but the way you structure your company directly affects how easily you can hire, fire, or restructure your workforce.\
\
LLCs are the most common (company types guide), offering flexibility\
Bahrain Free Zone companies offer labor flexibility, but with extra LMRA oversight (free zones details)\
100% foreign-owned companies now enjoy equal labor law rights\
\
Choosing the structure that matches your market goals—something I learned by trial and error when opening a Diplomatic Area branch—can mean the difference between an easy exit process and a bureaucratic nightmare.\
\
Expert Recommendations and Tools\
I strongly recommend working with a professional service provider who understands both the law and Bahrain’s local business customs. My pick: Keylink. Their up-to-date templates, LMRA filing support, and accounting solutions have saved me both time and money—plus their local staff understand the unspoken rules of doing business in Bahrain.\
And always stay updated with Bahrain.com for regulatory updates, and seek out Forbes Business for global best practices tailored to Bahrain’s unique market.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Employment Contract Terminations\
1. Can I terminate an employment contract in Bahrain without cause?\
\
Only with proper notice and if not discriminatory. For fixed-term contracts, only at the end or with specific legal grounds.\
\
2. What are the penalties for late notification to LMRA or MOICT?\
\
Fines of BHD 50–100 per day, plus possible suspension of new work permits. Avoid delays by using online Sijilat and LMRA platforms.\
\
3. How quickly can I complete a legal termination?\
\
With all documents ready: 3–5 business days (even faster with digital uploads and morning visits to Bahrain Bay LMRA branch).\
\
4. What’s the most cost-effective way to manage contract exits?\
\
Use Keylink’s formation cost guide for budgeting, and rely on bundled accounting and HR services to avoid redundancy or settlement errors.\
\
5. Do I need a local sponsor to manage terminations?\
\
Only if your license requires one (local sponsorship info). Most 100% foreign-owned companies can handle terminations directly.\

The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts; that was the first thing I noticed about him. We walked toward each other, me crossing the street as an SUV slowly approached.

When he walked past me, I felt a surge of heat, like an oven door had just opened. With it came a fetid air like that of burnt plastic. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street; that’s when I noticed the second thing.

The SUV came to a rolling stop at the stop sign, seeming not to notice him. I screamed and threw my hands in the air as I ran toward them, but the car passed right through the man as if he wasn’t there. It was only then, looking at him closely, that I noticed the third thing: he was translucent, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out the dark shadow of a house.

I watched him until he turned the corner. Then I ran home, looking over my shoulder to make sure the ghost wasn’t following me.

At the time, my life was purgatory. I was 22 and had just graduated college. I was living with my parents and hadn’t found a “real” job yet. More and more, I felt like a failure. I worked 20 hours a week at a grocery store and spent the rest of my time applying for positions that claimed to be entry-level, but required years of experience. You know the deal.

I had this constant urge to reinvent myself: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while I worked on my screenplays; sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van. Maybe I made a mistake wasting all those years in college. Seeing the ghost made me think that, maybe, I was destined for something greater.

I guess that’s why I went back to that street.

He wasn’t there the first few times I went, but I could always smell him, that pungently sour burnt smell, sometimes more fresh than others. It became a routine; I felt like a paranormal investigator.

One Sunday evening, walking about 20 feet behind a couple pushing a baby in a stroller, there he was, walking towards us. Same t-shirt, same shorts. I stopped where I was and watched.

Neither he nor the family gave any indication that they saw each other. The ghost walked with his eyes resolutely forward; the parents continued their conversation as he walked through them.

I found myself biting my thumb as he approached me. My heart hammered so loud that I barely heard the next car driving by. But I was determined to hold my ground. If there was a chance to experience something new, I wanted to face it. There had to be a reason why only I could see him.

The heat and smell consumed me as he passed me, but I followed him anyway.

The walk didn’t last much longer. We turned a corner, he walked toward an old abandoned house on the right, then disappeared as he entered the front yard.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man. He looked down at me and smiled like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A kid who just solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, right?”

I nodded.

“He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Where else would you spend your afterlife trying to reach?” He shrugged. “You want to get a cup of coffee?”

I laughed, and he flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” he asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. Either way, 15 minutes later, we had our drinks and were sitting down outside a local coffee shop.

“My name’s Charles,” he said. “How often do you see ghosts?”

“Not often.” I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time. 

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” Charles said, looking down at his drink. 

As it turns out, the house the ghost kept walking toward was Charles’ old house. He’d been watching the man for years, trying to figure out how they were connected. It was one of the first ghosts he’d ever seen.

After that day we started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get coffee, other times it was dinner, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first coffee date. To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation; he hid it well, but I could tell by how hard he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. 

Most importantly, he was my key to the world’s secrets.

So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be closer to him. I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, what kind of shampoo he used. I wanted to understand him, and you can’t understand someone unless you know how they live when they’re alone.

So we went to his apartment. He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes. 

He showed me to his room: a bed, a desk, and a computer.

“You sure know how to live.”

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no.

There weren’t a lot of places to hide inside the apartment, but it took me a long time to find him because I was walking so slowly. I thought he was planning to jump out and scare me.

I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. I opened the towel closet half joking, but found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. When I reached for him, he straightened his legs and scooted out. He stood up, and I kissed him. I didn’t know how else to make him feel better.

For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd make love. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either; it made him happy, so I did it.

We were lying in his bed one night, no hiding and no seeking, my head on his chest, when he told me everything.

Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in his backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he began talking to a “grey man” house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence: his chest and his back. She said she was beating the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said. “Part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all; he was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her no.

When she tried to hit him with the other hand, he caught that one too. He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again, but each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed, with another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he said.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window one last time, he saw her, searching for him.

“I think it has something to do with trauma,” he said. “Or purpose. Maybe they’re one and the same. I was her trauma, and her purpose was to stop me. She thought beating me could stop me. And when she couldn’t beat me anymore… she had no purpose. She’s stuck living in a world where she’s always trying to find me, even when I’m not there.”

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and I looked for him harder than ever.

The next day, we went to see the ghost again. 

“Why do you think he’s still here?” I asked.

“Trauma, I guess.”

“And how come I can see him?”

“You’re probably connected somehow. You see them more strongly when you are.” We watched him until he disappeared. 

I’ve always wondered where he goes when he’s not there. Is he stuck somewhere in between our world and elsewhere? Does he choose to come back, or is he forced to? Why doesn’t he leave?

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold him. It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Sure, I didn’t hate his company, but I didn’t love it either. And was I helping him heal from his trauma, or forcing him to stay in it? Did he realize how transactional our relationship was?

Around the same time, I found a job as a tutor. It was full-time and I found myself enjoying the work, looking forward to sessions, and feeling as though I had a purpose: helping these kids get into college. Life was good; I didn’t need to chase something extreme to feel like I was living.

I began drifting away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week. He tried to reach out, but I always had some reason why I couldn’t come over. Once a week turned to every other week. Then we were just texting every so often. We became strangers.

I started going to see the ghost on my own again. I was becoming braver, more used to it. I’d walk directly behind it, copying its every move. As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, finishing the steps that he couldn’t. 

But as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. There wasn’t a point in what I was doing. 

I started reaching out to him again. I texted him a few times, and he didn’t answer, but I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two months later, and I’d never replied.

All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. Watching him became like watching the Northern Lights must after enough time. If I couldn’t be a part of it, what was the point?

I got in my car and drove to Charles’ apartment. I knocked on his door, but when he didn’t answer, I went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. I was angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement, my joy. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name a couple of times. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. After a moment, I realized that he was sinking into it. The body in the tub was his ghost, wearing a familiar t-shirt and shorts.

“Oh God,” I cried.

Charles looked up at me and smiled. “You found me.”

“What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

“You were using me.”

I paused for a second, tried to think of a response, then gave in, crying. “Yes, I was. But I still care. I’m sorry.”

He didn’t respond, just stayed curled in a ball.

“Why are you still here? Why can’t you move on?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t respond for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“There’s a road… I don’t know what’s on the other side.”

“I’m so sorry… Charles, you need to go. You don’t want to be stuck here forever. Please. I’m sorry.”

“IfI go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “Can I walk the road with you? Can I help you?”

I let him lead the way. But I was there every step. We walked out of the apartment, down the street, and toward my neighborhood. We turned a corner, and I realized exactly where we were going. 

Ahead of us was the ghost. I let Charles get further ahead of me, and as he approached the ghost, their steps synced together. Tears formed in my eyes, and it took all I had to stop from sobbing. “It’s gonna be okay,” I whispered. “Everything is gonna be okay.”

We turned a corner and walked toward the house. The smell was worse than ever. Death. A phantom scream came from somewhere… somewhere else.

The ghost disappeared. Charles didn’t. We walked to the burnt front door. Heat slowly consumed me, first comforting, then burning, like I was approaching an open flame. Blurred in my tears, I saw fire; when I blinked it was gone.

I followed Charles until the burning was too much.

He turned to me and smiled. “It’s okay,” he said. “I’ll be okay.”

He stepped into the house. Into the quiet, into the loud, into the burning, into the calm.

I sat on the curb for hours; I waited for the ghost, for Charles, to come back, but he never did. Charles is gone. I hope he’s better; I hope he’s happy. 

I’m sorry.

Anyone else have hair that curls or spirals but the hair too close to your head falls flat? (since I essentially have a bob none of my hair will curl up except sometimes the first 2 inches are and then the rest falls flat for reasons).

I noticed I'll find hairs when shampoing that are extremely curly, so i wonder if its just fine hair? (like 3b. sort of tight curles but alot looser than corkscrew).

However it actually puffs up some and takes on some life if i wear a hat, even if the hat wouldve flattened it out, which makes me think that even if it doesnt feel dry its actually really dry(and i wasnt actually overmoisturizing it). The hat coult actually be drying it up since its one of those knit/acrylic hats)

I'll also find others hairs sometimes that are equally curly but my familly's hair is all brushed straight/wavy...so it makes sense that its just not enough moisture. Humidity here is pretty decent too.

Also I'll find really really weak thin hairs that just might be damaged but they're very very tight compared to those other hairs. Always thin though, its weird. Thought i was going grey cause theyre light too.

I guess my hair is just either straight/slightly wavy or really really weak (my diet sucked, i'd eat like only late at night and sometimes skip a meal for coffee, wouldn't be surprised if the reason my hair is glowing out a bit differently at the roots its cause I'm eating/living healthier now.) My hairs aren't really fine, they're a bit thicker and sometimes i find darker hairs(not like thyroid issues symptoms just more akin to one of my parents hair) so I'm wondering if i just have some hairs that are causing it to flatten out

*""The sound struck fear into the Mar-gite. We thought the Mar-gite didn't feel fear, that they didn't have the neural wiring for it.*

*""The sound of 'meep meep meep' carried through the vacuum as they charged into Mar-gite boarded vessels.*

*""The Felt Marines were on our side.*

*""It's thirty years later and that sound still makes my hands shake.""* Commander A'argu'uyle - Kra'at Systems Ship Executor Officer. Mar-Gite Siege of Cygnus Orion

""Another wave, Admiral! Two-hundred fifty six point sources! All in Giga or higher range!"" tactical called out. ""We've got another dark matter pool forming!""

**HEAVY METAL INCOMING** rang out. Admiral Kra'akenwulf knew it was full of data for the navigation, communication, and other stations as well as a warning.

The Solarians were coming.

The *Iron Fist* shuddered as it suddenly corkscrewed through space, its damaged engines roaring, vibrating the whole ship as it managed to avoid a brace of spears as well as the cloud of 'boarders' sailing through space. A quick glance showed that the boarders would sail out and hit the stellar mass in a few months without intercepting anything.

Lighter ships or ships that had been heavily damaged had been tasked with taking out any groups of 'boarders' or any spears that might intersect with an orbital body before falling into the stellar mass.

The ship shuddered again and the artificial gravity heeled over to the starboard.

Admiral Kra'akenwulf held onto the bar that circled the holotank with his left side0 hands, pointing at holotank 3 with his upper right hand.

""Go to evasion!"" he shouted. He had a steady whining noise in one ear and was blind in two eyes. ""Tell the *Pride of the Emperor* Task Force to pull back!""

He knew that everyone had to keep at least a five light second distance between themselves and the Dra.Falten task force, since the weapons were dangerous to everyone, allies and the Dra.Falten alike.

""Dark matter pool is showing bulging!"" scanners called out.

**ARISTAEUS IS HERE** roared out enough that several of the Mar-gite constructs near the dark matter pool suddenly exploded into slurry that froze almost instantly. The dark matter pool bulged, then tore, splashing dark matter for light seconds. Mar-gite clusters hit by it detonated, pieces flaming, burning in th vacuum of space with purple fire that completely consumed them.

What came emerged was a massive colossus closer in size to a subcontinent than a standard spacecraft. Its warsteel hull looked like a female Terran sitting down, legs open, arms held out wide. She was naked, lush to the point of obese, with her hair spilling down her back. Broken chains hung from her arms and legs and crisscrossed her chest and vanished under her hair.

The holotank flickered and what appeared made Kra'akenwulf blink.

It was a puppet made of plush, blue fur, wide eyes, a big mouth, a medieval helmet on his head. Above its head read **dumbwire approximation** in floating letters.

""Captain Super-Grover here, Admiral,"" the puppet exclaimed, flailing its arms.

Kra'akenwulf realized the strange creature was wearing a cape.

""Stack your ships up for repair! Dumbwires for all!"" the puppet yelled. It thrust a fist in the air. ""NONE SHALL FALL! WE'RE BUILT FOR THE STREETS!""

The signal suddenly cut out.

Kra'akenwulf didn't bother asking questions.

""Queue them up by most need and most tonnage,"" Kra'akenwulf said.

Another set of spears slid by so close lightning arced off of the *Fist's* battlescreens to play up and down the compressed calcite spear.

The Kra'at heavy cruiser *You Serve at the Voter's Sufferance Not Consent* moved up to one of the outspread legs, cuddling up to the outside of the massive thigh. Gantries and tractor/pressor beams reached out, gently cradling the mangled hull and bringing the massive 2 kilometer long warship close.

Fuzzy creatures that resembled long bodied long mouthed felt puppets clad in armored spaceesuits charged in to work. Welder's sparked, hammers slammed against bent hull plates to the rhythm if 'yup yup yup'.

Inside a massive fluffy yellow bird wore a cap with the left side curled. It cracked a whip at the shaggy elephantine creatures.

""PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT, YA SCURVY DOGS! THE BATTLE'S STILL ON!"" the avian creature shouted over the din of the repair bays. ""GET OUT THE WIRES AND MAKE THOSE SHIPS DUMB!""

At the windowed repair oversight bridge a creature much like the Captain, only red and without helm or cape, watched with cold calculating eyes as the puppet ship crews flew into a frenzy of activity. He pointed out any starting mistakes, any misstep, any confusion and corrected it with a voice of frozen helium that was obeyed instantly.

The cape and helmet clad Captain turned to a green hairy version wearing in jungle camouflage fatigues already stained with motor oil and coffee grounds, his battered and dented helmet had a banana peel tucked into the strap with ""SEWN TO KILL"" written above it.

""Commit the widows, Commander, start recovering the derelicts. Get Marines out there,"" the Captain ordered, flailing his arms.

""Aye, Captain. Tasking the widows,"" snarled the puppet that everyone knew joined the Black Fleet just to spite the recruiters.

Tugs detached from the woman's hair, spreading out, heading for mission killed or partially destroyed craft or ships that could not move under their own power. They looked like Terran woman in tattered wedding dresses, veils tattered and torn. Their faces were half cold beauty, half skull visage, their arms reached out toward their target, the razor sharp talons curled in a gentle yearned.

Emanating from the tugs were psychic screams of absolute rage and insanity.

One tug reached out their cupped hands, taking hold of the target. It nestled up to a heavily damaged super-cruiser. It connected as the arms wrapped around, tubes shooting out to connect to the holes created by the Mar-gite to board the ship. Another joined it, on the opposite side of the hull, the arms of the ship wrapping around the massive warship.

The desperate crew members, some down to fighting with prybars, knives, or worse, felt their ship jostle as the tug, shaped like a woman gowned and veiled with outstretched arms, reached out and drew their ship close.

There was a tremble to the deckplates.

The crew heard it, insanely, through the vacuum.

meep meep meep meep.

Then an all consuming crazed scream of insane joy and pleasure.

Dozens of screams, all overlapping.

From the tugs flooded the Marines. Crazed eyes, red curly fur, a roaring chainsword in their hands, a spiked collar around the neck. Behind them came a shorter, purplish creature with a question mark for a nose, stitches down one side of his face, an archaic designed Kevlar helmet with Gunnery Sergeant rank on the front, an unopened pack of Pall Mall reds on one side and ""<3 CAMILLA"" written in dried chicken blood on the other. Behind them came a tall humanoid puppet with an elongated head with a shock of hair at the top. It pointed out directions, shouting a sharp and almost chirping ""meep! Meep meep meep!"" as it did so.

The Marines rushed down the corridors of the ship. Hundreds of them, with scores of SNCOs and dozens of officers.

All looking identical.

The Mar-gite screeched in the vacuum and charged the puppet creatures.

In seconds the interior of the ship was a nightmare of starfish flesh, howling felt, snarling chainswords, and thundering guns.

Armored vac-suit engineers rushed from behind the tall 'officer' puppet, pulling trails of copper wire behind them. They pulled open plating to start running wire through the bulkheads. Supervising them was a round headed puppets wearing old-tymie spectacles and a lab coat.

The red ones hacked apart the Mar-gite without care of their own injuries, of their own casualties, screaming with malevolent joy and unbridled rage as their cutting bars tore through Mar-gite flesh to spray frozen slurry across the decks and bulkheads. The hooked nose SNCO lit a cigarette with his flame thrower, then began hosing down groups of Mar-gite. The tall officer fired his sidearm, going ""Meep meep"" with every shot.

The crew, Lanaktallan, Telkan, and Puntimat, stared in shock as one of the wild eyed red puppets lifted a string of grenades over their heads and yanked the wire, pulling all ten pins free, then charged into a large pack of Mar-gite.

The explosion scattered burning Mar-gite meat, felt, and stuffing everywhere.

The other puppets cheered.

""WHOSE STREETS?"" the one with the curled nose yelled.

""OUR STREETS!"" the others screamed through the vacuum.

""MEEP MEEP!"" the officer added.

The Captain of the vessel just gave up trying to figure it out.

Kra'akenwulf knew none of it as he watched the entire battle. The Mar-gite were still making landing on the three planets, but the planetary defense was picking up the slack as more and more defense stations came online. Kra'akenwulf knew it was the Solarian creation engines manufacturing the defense points by the thousands.

He looked at one planet where the Mar-gite were swarming. Planetary defense was failing.

""Request Odin send reinforcements to Dalkanea,"" Kra'akenwulf stated, pointing at the planet. ""We're going to lose it and I'll be forced to planet crack it.""

The communications officer relayed the request.

The Odin fired a single round at the planet.

Kra'akenwulf frowned, but his attention was pulled away by as report from the High Mutator.

The twenty-eighth mutation testing was showing promise. Mutator 12776651xqE on Mega-Cluster had suffered nearly 60% Mar-gite mortality within six hours. That mutation would be tested against a Giga-Cluster. Mutator 1271645t6vEbn3 appeared to slow and hamper Mar-gite Cluster navigation and propulsion. Additional tests would be performed.

Kra'akenwulf knew that while it might not seem like too much help for the beleagured system, the mutations would prove useful in the future.

As an Admiral, it was his job to look beyond this one battle. To look at the war as a whole.

If the High Mutator could discover a method to prevent the Mar-gite from jumping to lightspeed, the war would change instantly.

A Tetra-Cluster group warped in, straight into Odin's guns. The massive Dead Fleet ship started pounding the clusters immediately. Nova Cannons, Superstring Compressor Cannons, World Anvil Guns, Rapid Fire Singularity Vibrational Oscillation Cannons, Temporal Resonance Cannons, and more were being fired by the two massive Dead Fleet ships.

The clusters started breaking up.

There was a flash in the distance, bright white, and Kra'akenwulf knew that one of the Dead Fleet ships had just cleared the area of any broken down clusters with something called a Reality Inversion and Oscillation Resonance Cluster Cannon.

""Realspace is recovering,"" the sensor tech called out.

""More point sources!"" tactical called out.

One of the Dra.Falten vessels shifted toward the newcomers.

It fired its main gun.

Space around the ship was suddenly full of sparkling glitter.

Space turned blue in globs between the Mar-gite cluster and the Dra.Falten ship.

The Mar-gite Cluster turned pink.

Then it burst into flame.

Then a wide-eyed emoji appeared above it.

The Emoji changed to be held in the hand of a nine hundred foot tall female Dra.Falten with sleek fur, prominent ears, wide expressive eyes, trembling whiskers, a military hat, a Dra.Falten high officer's uniform, and a pair of cat-ear headphone.

""The Empire will crush you all!"" the Dra.Falten female said from every speaker, in a voice that was high, breathless, and squeaky. ""Just like Bingo Cola crushes thirst!""

""Oh my Digital Omnimessiah, it's Pratty-Chan,"" someone laughed.

Kra'akenwulf pushed his doubts and worries away.

Let others worry about the repercussions of such strangeness, such wild abandon, and such reckless hate.

He had a system to save.

He glanced at one of the other planets.

The Planetary Defense Force and Irregular Civilian Volunteer Corps had been fighting almost as long as his ships, and he was approaching a full ten-day week.

He'd been unable to stop the Mar-gite from making planetary landing, but he could do his best to keep  down the reinforcements. The Mar-gite coming in didn't know enough to avoid the massive ships of the Dead Fleet, the deadly biomechanical ships of the High Mutator, the cobbled together junkpiles of the Dra.Falten, or his own ships.

Which meant they couldn't communicate with one another while they were traveling faster than light.

For a moment he wondered what was happening on the surface, then pulled his attention back to his fight.

*Groundside will have to take care of itself right now*, he thought.

Azzy felt his knees buckle as the creature floated forward.

In the shelter, his sister watched on the Tri-Vee as her brother's knees buckled and the fire from his gun slackened.

On the fourth planet, the Planetary Defense Force was nearly wiped out. The Mar-gite were trying to rip open shelter tunnel access doors.

The missile fired by Odin hit the retro-rockets, slowing down so that its impact was merely devastating to the surroundings instead of catastrophic to the pod. It hit, sunk in slightly, and tractor treads on the sides worked to lift the pod upright.

Inside the pod a single light lit up.

Memories and knowledge were pressed into blank gray matter.

Electricity hit like a freight train.

A woman groaned.

A screen lit up.

This week on the show…

On Day 222, I wonder if you are drinking patriot coffee, why there is no woke coffee, and hope that Bob Dylan will license his song “One More Cup of Coffee” to the woke coffee brand. I failed, up until this actual moment, to remember that Folgers had the slogan and jingle “The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup,” which literally contains the word “waking” aka “woke!” So, I guess there has been woke coffee all along right there in our midst. That’s what they call indoctrination by caffeine.

On Day 223, I discuss my ride home from The Goonies in which I turned on that channel that is slowly becoming a propaganda arm called CNN just long enough to hear the leader of the Trump administration claim that he is stopping crime. I thought he meant that he is stopping committing crimes, but no. I forgot momentarily that he must have a small mouse that lives in his rotted brain that tries to remind him that he is a convicted felon, but that mouse just isn’t loud enough. Also, I reveal that I once interviewed Corey Feldman.

On Day 224, I address the rumor that went around last weekend that the leader of the Trump administration was no longer with us. Personally, I did not believe these rumors because I do not believe that the leader of the Trump administration would go out quietly. He would never leave this Earth without making at least a few parting insults at Barack Obama. I also take the opportunity to remind us all that we need to stop paying attention to this crap.

On Day 225, I posted a video that seemed to get shadowbanned because I said that I wish I could hate more. I re-edited it, however, to mute the word hate, and that seemed to help even though I hated having to do that. My point was that with all of the people hoping that by Monday we would see the leader of the Trump administration as Bernie in a Weekend at Bernie’s type of situation, we fail to remember that this dude has grandkids who don’t know that he is a piece of shit. Let’s remember that.

On Day 226, I ponder the people who use that phrase “touch grass” as if we are all supposed to be the Peter Sellers film character Chaucey The Gardener as name-dropped by King Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys in the song “Shazam!” from their underrated late-career album “To The 5 Boroughs.” This day is partially to remind us that time is short and to use it gloriously, but also to name drop this song and album because most people seem to have forgotten about them.

Day 227 is for discussing “Faith,” which, like “Shazam!” is an incredible song, but is not “Faith” by George Michael, I mean actual faith. Do you know there are people who believe in God and do not believe that God is the leader of the Trump administration? Yes, they exist, and they are self-aware and critical enough not to believe the lies of the leader or the Lord. At least the lies of religion are supposedly based in love. The leader’s lies are based on his love of lying and the marks who love his lies. 

On Day 228, I elaborate about the reaction of the subject of my book and am reminded of the Barbra Streisand film The Mirror Has Two Faces, which I have not seen, but I was inspired by the title. When we see ourselves in the mirror, and then one day, there is someone else staring back that we don’t recognize, that can be a jarring experience. As I said earlier, I realized that when I gave my subject the book to read, I felt it was the right thing to do to be there for him as he processed my point of view. I am proud of the dude.

1n9nbgc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9nbgc,Banana cake with mocha frosting and candied walnuts,"Recipe from David Lebovitz Ready for Dessert. The crumb shot looks denser than it actually is. Very tasty. The coffee in the frosting overpowers the banana flavor in the sponge so I will reduce the coffee by 50% next time I make this. 

Cake
2 1/2 cups (350g) all purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, at room temp
1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp instant espresso
2 large eggs, at room temp
6 tbsp (90ml) buttermilk,yogurt, or sour cream - at room temp
2 cups (500ml) banana puree
1 1/4 cups (125g) pecans or walnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped

Candied Peanuts
1 cup (150g) raw or unsalted lightly roasted peanuts
1/2 cup (100g) sugar
3 tbsp (45ml) water
1/2 tsp flaky sea salt
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon

Frosting
10 oz (280g) bittersweet or semi sweet chocolate - coarsely chopped
1/2 cup (125ml) strong brewed coffee or espresso
10tbsp (140g) unsalted or salted butter, cut into pieces - room temp


Preheat oven to 175C. Butter the bottom and sides of two 9"" round cake pans and line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper.

To make the cake, in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, the baking powder, baking soda and salt.

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy - abt 5 mins. Add the vanilla and instant espresso powder, then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing until completely incorporated. Mix in half of the flour mixture, followed by the buttermilk and banana puree. Stir in the remaining flour mixture, then stir in the pecans or walnuts just until combined. Dont overmix.

Divide the batter evenly amonng the 2 prepared pans. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, abt 40mins. Remove fm the oven and let cool completely.

To prepare the peanuts. in a medium heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat, combine the peanuts, sugar and the water. When the sugar begins to liquefy, begin stirring. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the sugar crystallizes. Decrease the heat to medium low and continue to cook, stirring, letting the crystallized sugar on the bottom melt and brown slightly. Then use a heatproof spatula to scrape up the liquefied sugar and continuously coat the peanuts with it, tilting the pan to help the sugar coat the nuts evenly.

Once the peanuts are a bit glossy and coated with syrup (there will be some sugary crystals on them still, which is normal), sprinkle the sea salt and cinnamon over them. Stir the peanuts a couple of times, then scrape the candied peanuts onto a baking sheet and let cool completely.

To make the frosting, combine the chocolate and coffee in a medium heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the butter until combined. Let cool completely, until thick and spreadable.

To assemble the cake, run a knife around the sides of the cakes to help them loosen fm the pans. Invert one cake onto a serving plate and peel off the parchment. Spread abt 3/4 cup of mocha frosting over the surface of the cake. Invert the second cake layer out of its pan, peel off the parchment and place it over the frosted cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake.

Coarsely chop the candied peanuts and sprinkle them over the top of the cake.",10,1757123340.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

But! Here's my thoughts on a few of the samples I got from Haus of Gloi (Samhain, Scarecrow, Lettuce & Tomato Leaf, Coffee Haus, Kitchen Witch (sort of)). I let them rest a couple days, only had them on for 2 hours as after this point they stopped developing and just started fading. On mobile so sorry for poor readability.



SAMHAIN : Freshly turned earth, wet leaves, and a cool specter ridden wind!

I love a wet earth smell. One of my signature scents is fyrinnae's beneath the forest floor that I layer convergence zone and heirloom tomato over as it creates a perfect wet garden smell, but forest floor smells sooo good to me on its own. Like the perfect bag of soil from the gardening section. So I had high hopes for this! Well... Wet on skin: it's vaguely musty, with something sweet and skin-like underneath it. if i didn't know the notes, this is what i would have called ""cozy sweater,"" to me it smells like a cozy wool sweater from a dusty musty attic but not like the rancid thrift store moth-ball kind, more like ""the damp got in upstairs but everything is still fine"" kind and it smells a little nostalgic somehow, like there's an old spray of grandma's perfume lingering in the fabric. none of the written notes, though. It continues to smell mustier (again, not in a bad way) as it dries, a touch sweeter, and it also seems to blend well with my skin. Like ""my skin but better"" but ""my skin but I wore an old sweater and that smell is lingering on me.. but better."" My mom gets a hint of soap from it on me, which you will see is a theme here. Not bad at all, a little offbeat which is always fun to me, but not what I was looking for.




SCARECROW: Dried corn husks, dust, straw, weathered wood and a ruffle of inky black feathers.

This is straight up generic body soap. Like one of those body washes that have the milkier colored base and not the gel base if you know what I'm talking about. It's SO soapy i swear I can smell the lather. It had a bit of an artificial apple smell (like bath and body works artificial, not apple flavored candy artificial) when wet on the skin, but that went away within 15 minutes. I'm so lost girl like this is the bottles of body wash that you open the lid and sniff in the aisle of the grocery store. My mom said it's Irish spring. It does get more dusty the longer it stays on, by an hour in there's a heavy dust and something almost chemical-y note underneath the soap which is.. well. It's not nasty, but it's not good, either. After 2 hours it's body wash and just plasticky chemical, the dust has faded. We've officially reached nasty levels.




COFFEE HAUS: The Haus coffee accord! Freshly brewed coffee and hints of chocolate, caramel, almond and a touch of real coffee bean co2 extract!

In bottle it smells like caramel-heavy coffee. I made my dad wear this one actually lol i didn't have a free wrist to put this on, so skin chemistry between us might vary. Smells like a flavored coffee at first, like a keurig cup, then it quickly dissipates to just caramel and maybe some other sweet gourmandy coffee-creamer-but-no-cream kind of smells. For what its worth, my dad really liked it lol. Kind of a bummer to me though as i thought it would lean more photorealistic. Like, i would layer this under a TRUE coffee scent for some complexity, but don't buy this expecting coffee. My mom smelled this and got apples from it somehow? Anyways, when I end up trying this one (if i do. i don't love a sweet gourmand..) I will update the post or make a separate one if anybody is interested.




LETTUCE & TOMATO LEAF : Fresh from the garden! Crisp lettuce and aromatic tomato leaf. 

Immediately punches you with a very spicy green smell. I can see how it could be lettuce & tomato leaf, but I'm getting something else that I can't identify. Some sort of sharp, peppery green vegetable, like if you were roaming around outside and broke off the leaf of some plant. Something slightly soapy underneath, but i think it complements that well. Almost smells like if cucumber wanted to hurt you. This is very potent imo. The sharpness begins to die down but stays present. After 2 hours the sharpness is gone and it's just a green, lettuce-y cucumber soap smell. Like undercurrents of a fancy organic face wash or something. Not for me but if you want to invoke Poison Ivy, esp at the beginning, i think this would eat.




KITCHEN WITCH: Warm zucchini bread and pumpkin cookies, ginger root, aged patchouli, a sprinkling of anise seeds, and bundles of dried herbs hanging from cedar wood rafters.

Okay, this one is cheating on my part. It smelled so fucking vile I couldn't even put it on my skin. I did, however, torment my family by making them smell it, and they all hated it. My mom tried it on for about 30 seconds and in those seconds I could start to smell the zucchini coming out, but she scrubbed it off. Who the fuck made this fragrance and why. After the initial 3 times of going ""EW, what the fuck is that?"" and actually trying to consider what I was smelling, I could get the baked goods, but it was artificial and nasty. I could get the zucchini, and the herbs, but this scent is so goddamn confused with itself. Nothing blends together at all and I feel like the notes wouldn't even smell good on their own. I do think this taught me that I hate baked goods as a perfume note, so i will consider it worth it for that.




Honestly, not impressed with anything I tried. It must be a skin chemistry issue because plenty of other people seem to like them, but like, damn. I still have 6 to review, so I can make another post when I get around to trying those.",6,1757123225.0,Indiemakeupandmore,7,1.0,False

Before you judge don’t worry I will be getting decaf. I had a very long day today and just need something to bring me an ounce of joy, well I guess 16 ounces. I just got off yet another performance review where I had to tell my mentee he needs to behave or else he’ll get fired. I try not to get attached to my reports but I can’t turn off my empathy. 

I log off my computer and turn off my home office light of my cheetah print covered office. The last owners decided that they needed fuzzy wallpaper. I walk out nearly tripping on the pile of toys my two year old left on the ground. I walk up the stairs to get greeted by my son running towards me with a big smile yelling “maaaa.” 

Do you want to go to the coffee shop I ask? We can take a car ride. He loves car rides. 

“Broom broom” he says and runs to the door putting his shoes on the wrong foot. 

“I’m going to the coffee shop with Sonny.” I tell my husband. “I know it’s late but I just need to enjoy something. It was a long day at work.”

“I like when you enjoy things have fun!” He reassures me. 

He has always been supportive of me finding things I enjoy. He tries to encourage me to find hobbies and make friends. I’m lucky to have someone so supportive. 

I grab my keys to my suv. It’s brand new maybe a year old. I’m grateful to have a car that’s safe and has all of the extra safety features. 

I pick up Sonny and take him outside to the car seat. I buckle him into the car seat and hand him his Paw Patrol story book comfort item. I get into the car and head to the coffee shop. 

Once we get to the coffee shop Sonny immediately points to the muffins saying “muff muff” 

“I think he wants a muffin” the lady in front of me says while giving out a laugh. 
“Yes he loves his muffins.” I responded. I look at Sonny and ask “which muffin would you like?”

He points to a blueberry muffin. He reaches towards them while we wait our turn. I hold back all 30 pounds of him as the lady in front of me decides if she wants a medium or a large. I patiently wait trying to hide the defeat of the day on my face. 

Once it’s my turn I order and let Sonny pay. He takes my card and taps it against the machine. We sit at a table and I do my best to enjoy my latte as he drops muffin crumbs all over the floor. I chase his escape attempts around the shop in between sips.

Eventually we head home for bed time. I hope the coffe shop running is enough to get him to sleep. It’s wishful thinking as he pulls me in tight whenever I try to leave. 

I lay next to him wondering how I can be so stressed out. I can’t help but feel like something is off. I have a perfect son, a supportive husband, a dream house, a dependable car and a flexible job. I have what others dream of. It’s more than I could dream of. Despite what I have I still feel incomplete. I can’t figure out what could be wrong and eventually dose off. 

————————

I wake up in itchy blankets with no sheets on the bed. The room smells and I can’t help but feel uncomfortable. As I look for Sonny I start to wake up and realize I don’t have a son or a house or a car or a husband. Im not even an adult. The dream just felt so real. Especially compared to the nightmare I’m living. 
“Ruby get your ass out here now,” I hear my father shout. I know I’m in trouble for something I didn’t do, but I’m not sure what for. I hesitatingly walk out into the living room. I stomp through piles of garbage and dirty laundry on my way. 

“I thought I told you to clean the kitchen yesterday!” He yells. “I just want a glass of water and I can’t get one because the kitchen is a disaster. I want you to go in there and get me some water and then go back in there and stay in there until it is spotless.” 

I wanted to ask to go to the mall with my friends today but I don’t dare ask now. 
I look into the kitchen and there is a pile of trash up to my knees. The sink is fulll of dirty dishes that likely have maggots under them. I’m not certain how to even start. 

I see a package of plastic cups. Thank goodness they are clean. I take one out and bring him some water. He blares his Fox News in the living room as I stand in fear in the kitchen. I look at the clock it’s 7 am. It’s a Saturday and I wish I could just sleep in. I grab a trash bag and carefully pick up a few pizza boxes and old take out containers. I fear with each item what might be under them. It’s 8am and I hear him get up to leave the house. Once his truck drives off I sneak to the living room and take a nap on the couch. 

—————-

I wake up to Sonny kicking my back. It takes everything in me not to hug him and wake him up. That was such a terrible dream. The smell was so vivid that I could still imagine it now. I sneak out of his room into my room. My husband is sound asleep along with our dog. I get ready for bed and and hope my dreams get better. 

—————

“I thought I told you not to leave the kitchen” I wake up to my fathers voice causing me to jump off the couch. 
“I thought I’d be nice and buy everyone donuts but i see you don’t appreciate me. You kids are so ungrateful. I’m going to my room don’t bother me.” 

He storms off but leaves the donuts. I’m thankful because I am starving. I wish I had a better meal but I will take what I can get. The food in the fridge is all covered in mold and I need to eat something even if it is just sugar. After the donut I turn on the tv again dosing off once again. Trying to escape into my dreams.

————————————-

I wake up briefly to my dog barking. He must have heard the dishwasher running or something. I have never been so grateful to hear him bark because he wakes me from my inception of nightmares. I start to question if this is real or if I’m having a vivid dream. Am I   Being visited by a storybook ghost teaching me gratitude. Am I just living an escape. My identity starts to escape me as I fight my sleep. I fear falling back asleep as I don’t want to go back.

Main base of the perfume is a baked meringue, and you can pick what meringue flavor you want which I love, vanilla bean absolute, sugar, and a sprinkle of chamomile. 



Meringue flavor pistachio: very subtle hint of pistachio, not nearly as strong as something like the kayali gelato, it’s got a lovely warm vanilla that smells like a fresh baked yellow cake with a hint of that chamomile. It’s not overly sweet which I really like, a lovely gourmand that makes me think of my Disney princess themed tea party haha. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️



Meringue flavor blueberry: a much sweeter and fresher gourmand, almost reminds me of miss Dior although not nearly as strong or floral. It still has a nice vanilla smell but it’s not as warm as the pistachio. I really enjoy this one but I don’t think that I would buy a full bottle of it. Such incredibly soft smells that I absolutely adore. It almost has a hint of a rum smell as well. ⭐️⭐️



Meringue flavor strawberry: a much more sophisticated and much less overbearingly sweet version of strawberry poundcake, which is a scent that I absolutely love, very nostalgic scent very reminiscent of high school. It’s not a super bright and fresh smelling kind of strawberry it’s definitely a lot more toned down. The vanilla isn’t too strong in this one. It’s almost like a whipped icing kind of smell.

⭐️⭐️





**This is not a love spell:**

Notes: blueberry jam, violet, creeping ivy, lavender, star anise, vanilla



A very soapy kind of scent, like taking a nice relaxing bubble bath with a really strong lavender bath bomb. The violet and ivy are very prominent in this fragrance, which isn’t terrible but is also not one of my favorites. In my opinion the “soapiness” of it is a little too strong, you can feel it in the back of your throat. I don’t think the blueberry is very noticeable. Unfortunately this one does not meet my expectations, I was hoping for more of a mysterious and powdery kind of smell with a bit more of the berry, but maybe it’ll smell different once I actually wear it.

⭐️

**2am in Lafayette:**

Notes:  Vanilla co2, oak moss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar



The caramel is such a subtle note and I absolutely love that, im not huge into super duper sweet caramels, like the smell of a McDonalds caramel coffee, its much lighter and less sweet. You also get such a nice coffee smell, not overbearing and black, it reminds me of the distant smell of mom drinking her Starbucks coffee. I really love this one. Im not getting any hints of powder or Oakmoss but that might change once I’ve worn it on the skin. 

**The ghost wants birthday cake:**

Notes: warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom, vanilla bean ice cream, Indian sandalwood Mysore, Australian sandalwood



I don’t get much peach which is good, I’m not the biggest fan of peach scented perfumes,  but the cinnamon and cardamom are definitely very visible. The incense in this is also very nicely put together. The pairing works so well, there’s not much of a cake smell either which is actually nice in this one because Im not sure that I would love smelling cake and incense lol. The gourmand in this is soooo nice and a little haunting in a secretive kind of way. Its very unique.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

**The cookie party:**

Notes: buttery toffee, hot cocoa with floofy marshmallow, mounds of coconut, and pecan shortbread cookies



My favorite out of all of these. The toffee note is the perfect amount of sweet and its so hard to put into words the way that this smells, it’s almost buttery. I only get a very subtle hint of the coconut but I think that it pairs so nicely with everything else, it helps to tone down the sweetness so it’s not a nauseating gourmand. You definitely get a whiff of almost a pecan ice cream. Very creamy, very dreamy, especially because of the marshmallow, once again not overbearing, it’s the perfect amount. Absolutely love this and will be purchasing a full size. Im super excited to see how this wears on the skin, hoping to get a bit more of a coconut note.

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ireland vs. Hungary: A World Cup Sprint Where the Underdog Wears Green**

The stage is set for a European World Cup qualifier that’s less “epic showdown” and more “two teams sprinting to avoid a group-stage napalm.” On September 6, 2025, Ireland and Hungary square off in Dublin, where the only thing more tense than the soccer might be the bookmakers’ spreads. Let’s break this down with the precision of a ref’s whistle and the humor of a player tripping over their own shoelaces.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class No One Asked For

The decimal odds tell a tale of cautious optimism for Ireland (2.40) and skepticism toward Hungary (3.25), with the Draw (3.08) acting as the “I’ll just wait it out” option. Converting to implied probabilities:

* **Ireland**: \~41.7% chance to win.
* **Hungary**: \~30.8% chance to win.
* **Draw**: \~32.5% (because sometimes soccer is just a standing ovation for nobody).

The spread? Ireland is a -0.25 favorite, meaning they’re expected to win or at least avoid losing by more than a goal. For bettors, this is the soccer equivalent of ordering a “medium” coffee—safe, boring, and slightly confusing. The total goals line (Under 2.25 at 1.83) suggests this will be a game where scoring is harder than explaining why your team’s kit color is “military green.”

### Digesting the News: Sprint Start, Slow Espresso

Republic of Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson has labeled the campaign a “sprint,” which is sports-speak for “we need to win now or cry in the showers later.” His team faces a group featuring Portugal (the Ferrari) and Armenia (the tricycle), but Hungary—ranked 32nd vs. Ireland’s 48th—is the immediate hurdle. Hallgrimsson’s men have drawn two of their last three against Hungary, a result as thrilling as a Netflix password shared with your sister.

Hungary, meanwhile, is the soccer equivalent of a slow drip espress

No one can stop you on a bike, and the bike not only can take you all over the place, it gets you there within a time frame of lighting conditions you'd never make on foot. The other reason I wanted new photos was because I wanted to do a write up for this bike. It's a belt drive bike I got for commuting and cross country / bike packing. Belt drives are just about the toughest and lowest maintenance bikes you can get. Which is also why I took it out in the rain on Wed. I love when weather clears the bike paths.

I would, or I have been, but that's not really an option anymore. In fact, I couldn't tell you how many times I've told this story to various medical professionals. 

I'm thirty now, twenty years since it happened. I just want it to stop. 

I was a pretty average kid, I think. A little weird, but every kid is a little weird. 

I had an older sister, and we fought like two cats. I had a couple good friends, most of whom lived on my street or one street over, and we would meet after school and play until it was time for dinner. My life was fairly ideal. I played soccer, I think. Honestly, I have a lot of trouble remembering much of my childhood. 

But I remember that I got a Nintendo DS for my tenth birthday, and we had a big party in the backyard. Practically the whole neighborhood showed up. 

My birthday was just before school got out for the summer, so the air buzzed with excitement, and the evening was warm and felt more alive than other nights. The grown ups started a fire in our little fire pit, and they sat around it and drank beer while we ran around. I was allowed to stay up past when I usually went to bed, and the other kids chased fireflies with me and roasted marshmallows until late. 

I remember going to bed happy, excited for summer, and exhausted. I fell asleep quickly, the peel-and-stick glow in the dark stars and moons shining on the ceiling above my head. 

Waking up the day after my birthday, something felt... off. I couldn't put my finger on it. I hadn't had a nightmare, it wasn't that... I had slept better than I could really remember ever sleeping. 

It was late, I realized... that must be it. My mom usually woke me up around eight if it wasn't a school day. She said it was a good habit to be in the routine of waking up early and starting your day on the right foot. 

By the light streaming in from my windows and the slightly muggy heat in the room, I figured it was already 10 AM or so. 

I smiled, sliding out of bed. It must have been one final birthday treat, letting me sleep in. She had let me sleep in the day before too, of course, although on my birthday itself I had wanted to get up as early as possible. 

""Mom?"" I called into the hallway, poking my head out the door. 

No answer. I frowned. 

It was Saturday, so my dad was definitely already at work, but my mom wouldn't be. My sister wouldn't be home either... she had left the night before to spend the night at her friend's house. She was thirteen now, and allowed to have sleepovers, for which I was eternally jealous. 

I decided she must be out front in the garden. I put on a shirt and left my room. 

I smelled coffee, but there was none left in the pot. There were dishes in the sink, too, with remnants of egg stuck to a pan. It wasn't necessarily alarming, but it was strange... even on days I slept in, there was always breakfast left over for me. 

I opened the front door, opening my mouth to call out to my mom, but I instantly froze. 

Halfway up our walkway was the mailman. He was on the ground, sprawled out awkwardly on the cement, fresh blood pooled beneath him in a gruesome splatter. 

I didn't know what to do. I couldn't move. His limbs were bent at horrible angles, his face pointed away from me. It almost looked like something, some omnipotent force, had lifted him into the air and then slammed him back down. The package he must have been delivering lay a few feet away, the cardboard dented and soaked in red. 

I didn't need any confirmation he was dead. It wasn't a question. 

I had never seen a dead person before. Sometimes my parents had watched horror movies, but that hardly counted. 

I backed into the house and closed the door behind me. My mind was racing too fast and my heart felt like it might burst out of my chest: everything in my body was reeling, so much so that all I could do was move slowly, in a faux sense of calm. 

""Mom?"" I called out again, into the silent house, my voice breaking. ""Mom, are you home? Something happened outside! Mom!"" 

No one answered. The house felt way too quiet, all I could hear was the blood rushing in my ears. I had to brace myself against the wall as I made my way to my parent's room, because I was almost shaking too hard to hold myself up. 

""Mom...?"" 

I pushed open her bedroom door. It creaked, the sound almost deafening against the silence that blanketed the room. Our old grey cat, Gumbo, weaseled her way through the crack and slipped out into the hallway, brushing against my leg on her way. 

I saw a lump in the bed. For a moment I thought it was just pillows, but then I realized it couldn't have been... the bed was made, and all the pillows were accounted for, leaning against the headboard. 

""Mom, are you asleep?"" 

It came out as a whisper, even though it wasn't like I had been trying not to wake her up. I wanted her awake, badly. 

I think I just somehow already knew. Something was hanging in the air, this heaviness, like the whole world had been blanketed in a thing that was empty and hot and dead. A desert popped into my head, a place that was so far away from everything and completely devoid of anything. Devoid of life. 

When I pulled back the covers, the shock washed over me like an electric zap. Every one of my veins and bones and muscles felt twenty degrees hotter than they should have been. 

There was blood everywhere. I could barely see any section of the sheets that wasn't soaked in it. It looked like the cherry juice we sometimes made from the tree in our backyard, squashing the berries with our hands and laughing as the sticky syrup trickled down our wrists. 

Her eyes were open. Her mouth was open too, wide open, like she was about to scream. I gagged, stumbling backwards and almost falling down. My legs felt like they wouldn't work anymore. 

I was in a daze as I stumbled back to the kitchen. The eggs on the pan seemed like they were mocking me now. 

I knew my parents had told me what to do in an emergency, but all of that was gone from me now. This didn't feel like an emergency, it felt more like a horrible nightmare. I pinched myself on the arm, just in case. 

The neighbors, that was it. I was supposed to call my neighbors, the number was on a sticky note next to the phone. 

My fingers shook as I dialed the number. 

They picked up after three rings that felt like they took one year each. I heard a sort of crackling sound, like someone was moving the phone around. 

""Hello?"" 

""H-Hi..."" I cleared my throat, trying to get rid of the lump firmly lodged at the back of my tongue. ""This is... Jackson... from next door..."" 

I heard some sort of giggle, a choked one, like they were trying to hold it back, and then some hushed whispering. 

""Hi Jackson,"" the voice said. I assumed it was the mother, Mrs. Winston. ""Is everything alright? Can I help you with something?"" 

""I, uh... s-something happened... my mom..."" 

""Oh, honey,"" Mrs. Winston said, her tone gentle, but something about it felt deeply off. My stomach twisted. ""Why don't you head on over here, hm? We'll figure out what's going on together."" 

""Okay...""

I remember hanging up before she said anything else. Something about her voice was unnerving me. Still, I didn't know where else to go. I slipped out the back door so I wouldn't have to walk past the mailman, Gumbo watching me go. 

I knocked on the neighbor's door. 

No answer... 

I knocked again. Still nothing. 

I stepped into the flower beds, peering in through the windows. 

Someone was lying on the couch, their head tilted back like they were staring up at the ceiling. For a moment that was what I thought was happening, until I saw that their chest was opened up like a patient on a surgery table. All guts and organs and blood, so much blood. 

It was Mr. Wilson, in his sweater vest and brown dad shorts. 

Dead like the mailman. Dead like my mom. 

Something came over me, and I burst through their front door. It was unlocked, which I hadn't really expected, so I went tumbling into the room, landing on my stomach, my face slamming into the floor. 

Face to face with Mrs. Wilson, who lay dead in front of the phone. 

Her eyes were open too. There was a fly on one of them, crawling across the white, pausing every few seconds to rub its hands together. 

I had started to cry. It was finally hitting me that this was real, not some dream, and I desperately wanted my mom. 

I scrambled to my feet, nearly throwing up when I realized my face was covered in her blood... I swiped at it with my hands, trying to wipe it away as quickly as possible. 

Then, instinctively, I licked my lips. 

Horrified, I braced myself for the coppery taste of the blood on my tongue...

But it never came. 

It was... *sweet*. 

I hesitated, trembling incessantly, before cautiously raising one of my red fingers to my lips. 

*Sweet*. 

Memories flooded my mind, memories of baking with my grandmother, the sweet syrup we would sometimes pour into the mixing bowls... 

*It was fucking corn syrup.*

I ran to my father's work, which was on the other side of town. By the time I got there I was close to passing out and drenched in sweat... but it had made it a little easier to get here with the road completely devoid of cars. 

There were some, parked on the side of the road or every now and then in the middle of it, but none of them had people in them. 

Some of them had blood. Thick and red and gooey blood. 

The nice receptionist that was always at the front desk, and always gave me candy when my dad brought me in, had her head against the computer. Her hair was matted with red liquid, as if someone had ripped out entire chunks of her scalp. 

Before I could think too hard about it I wiped my finger across the side of her head and licked it. 

It was sweet too. I felt like my brain was going to break, like I was standing on the edge of something completely incomprehensible. 

I shook the woman. She flopped like a rag doll. I sobbed, shoving her, and she slumped to the ground, her head knocking against the tiles. 

""Wake up!"" I screamed at her. ""I know you're not dead!"" 

She didn't move an inch. Just stared, unblinking, her mouth hanging half open. 

I ran into the room my dad usually worked in, scanning it for his work space... I couldn't remember where it was, just that it was around halfway back, and close to the wall. 

In every cubicle someone was dead. Sometimes they looked halfway peaceful, as if they'd been caught by surprise, but most of them were eviscerated in one way or another. Entrails hanging out, bones showing, blood sprayed against the walls, even some with faces ripped clean off. It was like something unseeable had swept through the town on a rampage. 

But all of their blood was made of corn syrup. 

In a brave moment I even touched one of the organs, something that looked like a strange deflated balloon, and it jiggled, but more like plastic than a human body part.

At one point I swore I heard a giggle behind me. I whipped around, but no one was there. 

I found my dad at the water cooler, sitting against the wall, cone paper cup still gripped loosely in his hand. He stared straight ahead, blood leaking from his eyes, nose, and mouth, like he'd exploded from the inside. 

""Dad,"" I whispered, grabbing his shoulder. ""This isn't funny... please stop..."" 

There was a strange look on his face that I could just barely make out through the red. Almost like a smile. Like a smile someone would only make if they were trying very hard not to. 

I walked back home down the middle of the road, balancing on the yellow lines to have something to focus on, because I was fairly certain if I stopped walking, I wouldn't start again.  

When I got there, I climbed into bed and I closed my eyes. I didn't know what else to do. 

Eventually, after what must have been hours and hours of lying there, I drifted off into a restless sleep. 

I woke up to someone shaking my shoulder. I screamed, scrambling away from them, immediately wide awake and terrified. 

""Woah!"" My mom backed away, smiling. ""Sorry buddy, I didn't mean to scare you!"" 

I was breathing hard. I looked her over, clutching my chest. 

She was... completely fine. She looked it, at least. She stood there in a white blouse and blue jeans, her hair tied up like always, her eyes bright and happy. 

""What... what day is it?"" 

Her smile faded, and she frowned a little. It was then that I noticed the smell of bacon wafting in from the kitchen. 

""It's Sunday, bud, remember?""

Two days after my birthday. So yesterday had been real... 

""What happened yesterday?"" 

She placed the back of her hand on my forehead, tutting softly. ""Did one of those neighborhood kids you play with get you sick, honey? Do you feel okay?"" 

I dropped it, because I didn't know what to say. I convinced myself maybe I really was sick, maybe it had been some kind of feverish hallucination. And I was so relieved to see her, I didn't want to think about any of it anymore. 

I went to eat breakfast, sitting at the table between my dad and my sister, and everything was normal. 

But when I left the house later that day, I saw it. On the walkway leading up to our house, there was something pink on the pavement... a faint pink stain, like something sweet and red and sticky had been recently scrubbed away. 

Like I said, it's been thirty years. I've been feeling like I had almost recovered from that incident. I had asked everyone I knew countless times about that day, but none of them seemed to have any idea what I was talking about... but still, I had almost let it go, and it had never happened again. 

Not until today. 

Today, when I walked into my therapists office, it seemed strangely quiet. There was usually music playing, something soothing and soft, and there were people in the waiting room and at the front desk typing on a keyboard... 

But today, nothing. No one. Silence.

I let myself into Dr. Sheldon's office, perplexed. 

Which is when I found her dead on the carpet, her blood sprayed across all the walls, even dripping from the ceiling. 

It was crazy, I know that, but I immediately tasted it. 

Sweet. 

I rolled her over, and her eyes were open, a strange smile on her face. This time I did something I didn't think to do as a kid... I checked her pulse. 

She's alive. 

I don't know what to do. I can't believe they're doing this to me again. 

Do they think this is funny?",32,1757122597.0,nosleep,2,0.97,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **England vs. Andorra: A World Cup Qualifier Where the Only Drama Is Whether Andorra Will Score First**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a mismatch so stark it could make a Roman Colosseum gladiator blush. On Saturday, England—the footballing titan with the swagger of a cat that’s just knocked over your expensive vase—faces Andorra, a team whose recent form reads like a broken vending machine: you insert hope, you get despair. Let’s unpack this with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet-obsessed uncle and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

### Parsing the Odds: England’s Dominance Is Math, Not Opinion

First, the numbers. England has trounced Andorra 26-0 across seven previous meetings, a margin so vast it could qualify as a mercy rule in a less civilized era. Recent form? England has won four of their last five qualifiers, including a 5-0 thrashing of Ireland and a 3-0 dismantling of Latvia. Andorra? They’ve lost four straight qualifiers and drawn 0-0 with Malta, a team that once fielded a goalkeeper who moonlights as a librarian (quiet, please—*shhh*).

The betting lines reflect this gulf. England is favored by -4.25 goals on the spread, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by *at least* five. The over/under is 4.5-4.75 goals, a total that sounds high until you remember England’s last game ended 5-0. If you’re betting, the “Over” here is as safe as leaving your keys in a Tesla’s trunk.

### Digesting the News: England’s Full Strength, Andorra’s… Well, Let’s Just Say They’re “Light on Hype”

England’s squad is fully fit, with Thomas Tuchel set to include Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson. Jack Grealish, meanwhile, remains a spectator, presumably practicing his Everton jersey’s wrinkle-resistant fabric. For Andorra, the “squad” is a polite term for “a group of people who hope to n

Nasira kasi ‘yung phone ko kasi nabasa siya ng tubig ulan and bigla na lang siya nag-o-off after 2-3 minutes so when we went sa mga technicians sabi nila na sakit na raw ‘yun nung model ng phone ko. 


Instead na ipagawa, bumili na lang ako ng bago and yung latest model pa. 128gb lang rin kasi mahal na yung 256 eh HAHAHA and entry level lang din naman work ko kaya i don’t think i can afford it that much yet 😂 so ito na ang exciting part… lol so pauwi kasi ako nun on a friday and nasa Buendia na ako. I remember when I bought my phone may sinabi yung babae sakin na “takaw tingin” and prone to theft itong phone kasi nga latest ganon. So what I did is nilagay ko siya sa bag ko. 


Pagkasakay ko ng bus, wala pa masyado pasahero at the time, I tried to reach for it pero wala???!!!! and i was like, what???? nanakaw ba?!!! eh kabibili ko lang nun. so i what i did is bumaba ako ng bus and went to the nearest police station to file a report kasi nga parang may insurance ‘to na they’ll replace it bsta mag file ng police report proving na nanakaw nga. So, pumunta ako sa police post sa may Buendia and dun inassist ako nung pulis. Lol nawalan na nga ako ng courtesy at the time kasi imbes na “Sir” ay  “Kuya” ang tawag ko sa kanya and he was literally calming me down the whole time and naalala ko na i spilled ‘yung coffee dun sa table niya pero sobrang calm pa rin ni sir kahit ngarag na ngarag na ko 😭 


Dinouble check ko ‘yung bag ko and inalis ko ‘yung mga damit ko na iuuwi ko and ayun… nag camouflage lang sya sa bag ko kasi bare pa lang siya at the time (no case ganyan) and ayun bumalik ako sa bus and curious bigla sina mamang driver if ano nangyari and ayun sa likod na ako nakaupo kasi pununan na nung bumalik ako.

1n9mxul,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9mxul,It's all a matter of perspective,"
used to use my small spare bedroom in my apartment as a games room. I had a 68cm CRT , one of those ten space IKEA cube things, an 8 way switcher and a whole bunch of consoles connected. Whatever I felt in the mood for playing it was just a button press away. Was a pretty good setup.

Then I decided that was a lot of space for something I wasn't doing a lot of. So I turned that space into an office/workshop. Whenever I felt in the mood I'd just play on my LCD TV. It's ok for N64. And fine for GameCube onwards. And my Atari 2600 is passable, maybe because of the basic graphics and the fact no one was trying to massage extra effects from CRT anti aliasing etc.

The really weak spot is my mega drive (and maybe SNES and Jaguar, haven't played them for a while). I guess that era was the height of using the CRTs limitations to create effects. It just looks much better on a CRT.

But there isn't a lot of room in my living room for a dedicated spot for a large CRT. I have an upright arcade machine in the corner and a cocktail cab as a coffee table. I still have a stack of CRTs in my garage. It occurred to me that proportion and perspective is everything. Why not put a 34cm CRT on the cocktail cab/coffee table? The results are really good. The screen's apparent size is not much smaller than the much larger LCD further away, and it takes seconds to unplug it and put it in a cupboard. It's also quite a comfy playing position. In fact more comfy than the old games room as the 68cm always felt a tad high on the IKEA cube thing.  I'm a very happy chappy 😊

I still suggest to people who want to get into retro games that if all they have is an LCD with AV inputs, then that's still a start and not to go nuts and overspend on a CRT that someone down the track would probably have given them for free. I look it like record collecting - if your mega drive is the actual record, then an LCD TV is a cheap turntable with built in speakers. Play it that way for a while, then when you can you upgrade your equipment. And enjoy the same games all over again due to the increase in quality playback. The difference is that it almost always costs more to upgrade your stereo, but you can often upgrade your retro gaming experience with a CRT (if you're patient) for peanuts/free.

Let’s talk about what’s making me smile from ear to ear lately:

- It’s easier than ever to connect apps, files, and data in minutes.  
- You can automate the most mind-numbing tasks—emails, file sorting, even generating reports—without writing a single line of code.  
- Tools like Zapier, Make (integromat), Pipedream, n8n, and, of course, GPT-based workflow builders are *super* accessible.  

What once required a request to IT and weeks of waiting, now takes a morning, a YouTube video, and a cup of good coffee. ☕

But the most exciting part? The *vibes.*  

People who never saw themselves as “techy” are suddenly building automations to run businesses, streamline personal projects, or just make life easier. Small teams are punching *way* above their weight doing things that used to be exclusive to Fortune 500 companies. I’ve talked to teachers automating class reminders, creators running sophisticated content calendars, and students streamlining research—all without any CS background.

A few things I’m amazed by lately:

- The way no code bridges the gap between ideas and execution. Have an “I wish I could just…” moment? There’s probably a no code way to make it happen.
- The sheer number of integrations popping up. Your accounting app talks to your project manager, which pings your custom Slack bot—like, WHAT?
- How it’s turning “non-technical” people into problem solvers and mini-entrepreneurs.

Of course, it’s not *all* sunshine. Sometimes automations break and you need to troubleshoot mystery bugs (that “Why did Step 3 run twice?!” moment). And scaling up big workflows takes some planning! But on balance, the excitement totally overshadows the bumps.

So, what are you automating with no code right now that makes you want to high-five someone? Have you experienced that “I can’t believe I just built this myself!” feeling yet?

Drop your favorite no code tools or workflows below—let’s spread the excitement! 🙌

There's a subtle but powerful magic that exists all around us, often hidden in plain sight. It's the kind that makes your heart feel a little lighter, your mind a little clearer, and the world a little brighter. These are the moments of magic, and they're waiting for you to notice them.

We're so often consumed by our busy lives, focused on the next deadline, the next task, the next notification. We race through our days, ticking boxes and chasing goals, and in the process, we forget to pause. It's in these pauses that the magic reveals itself.

Maybe it’s the way the light filters through the leaves of a tree in the late afternoon, casting dancing shadows on the ground. Maybe it's the perfect song coming on the radio just as you're lost in thought. Or maybe it's the unexpected kindness of a stranger, a simple smile that reminds you of our shared humanity.

These moments don't require grand gestures or special occasions. They’re woven into the fabric of our everyday lives, quiet and unassuming. A child's uninhibited laughter, the first sip of coffee on a chilly morning, the smell of rain after a long dry spell. Each of these is a tiny, perfect gift.

So how do we invite more of this magic into our lives? It starts with presence. Put your phone away for a few minutes. Take a deep breath. Look up. Really look. Notice the details you usually rush past. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you feel?

The more you practice being present, the more attuned you become to these small wonders. It’s like a muscle you can strengthen. And as you do, you’ll find that the moments of magic aren't just moments anymore. They become a way of seeing the world—a lens through which you experience the beauty and wonder that has been there all along.

Start your own collection of these moments. Write them down in a journal, take a picture, or simply hold them in your heart. You'll soon discover that your life is not a series of tasks to be completed, but a series of magical moments waiting to be discovered.",1,1757122087.0,momentsofmagic,0,1.0,False

I want us to feel that magnetic and emotional pull — like the minute we lock eyes, the world becomes outside noise. 

I’m 31, 5’4, Japanese-American, HWP (height weight proportionate), with long dark brown hair and bangs, and dark brown almond-shaped eyes. I’m very in touch with my feminine side. I’m based in Los Angeles and work as an instructional assistant at an elementary school while pursuing my Early Childhood Education Units, building a meaningful career in education. 

A bit about me: I take care of myself and often get mistaken for being in my twenties (not going to lie, it’s fun). I love coastal drives, bookstores, traveling, writing (currently working on a horror-romance novel), and losing myself in synthwave — right now, Chromance by Kalax is on repeat. My favorite 2000s film is The Girl Next Door. I don’t smoke or use drugs, and I drink minimally. 

I love good morning texts, consistency, honesty, and emotional depth. I want the kind of romance where you pick me up at my door with flowers, and as the night ends, you’re already asking, “So, when can I see you again?” No guessing games. No one left wondering or waiting. 

I want a romance that makes my heart race at 100 miles per hour, where we laugh endlessly, trust and respect each other fully, and I wipe the lipstick off your lips after every kiss. I want to feel the spark, fire, and passion — as well as the stability and calmness that comes from knowing we’re truly right for each other. I want a romance that burns so bright all because it feels so right. 

I want us to feel like we’re 21 again — full of excitement and possibility — yet with the emotional stability of adults who know who they are. I’m looking for someone who isn’t just a fantasy, but feels like my best friend and someone I’ve known my whole life. Tattoos and leather jackets are a bonus; I have three tattoos myself. Together, we could be like James Dean and Audrey Hepburn — timeless, magnetic, unforgettable. 

I’m looking for a man who is in touch with his masculine side but is highly emotionally intelligent and respectful. I like a guy with a bit of a bad boy edge — tattoos, leather jackets, maybe a motorcycle — but who is still a respectful, grounded, and decent man at heart. Someone who always follows through with what he says, has his own life, passions, and goals, and takes care of himself physically and emotionally. Between 30–40, tall, stable, obviously single, and carrying a dark, intriguing edge. You don’t smoke (weed, cigarettes, vaping, etc.) or use drugs. You treat wait staff with the same kindness and respect you’d show anyone else. Monogamy only. Tattoos, cars and/or motorcycles, leather jackets, and basic common sense and literacy are a HUGE bonus! 

And please: send intentional, thoughtful messages. Not “hey,” “what’s up,” or “m 38. Got a pic?” Effort matters. I want a man who texts and talks like a GROWN MAN. 

Picture us: riding off into the sunset on your motorcycle, laughing while we run errands together like it’s our own private inside joke, or sitting quietly at an overlook watching the city lights below — knowing we’re exactly where we belong. And maybe later that night, we’re back under the neon glow of Los Angeles, kissing like the whole world has disappeared. Beyond that, we’ll explore LA together — from hidden coffee shops to city lights and coastal adventures — making memories in every corner of this city. (For now, I don’t have a motorcycle or a car, but I’m planning to get one in the next 2–3 months — so you just might be my favorite driver until then.) 

Note: I’d prefer if you were in Los Angeles or Orange County — but if you’re in the US or Canada, you’re still welcome to try. If you’re in another country, it might be difficult to make this work. If you feel that spark reading this, send me a thoughtful message — and yes, include a photo. Chemistry matters, and I want to know if we’ll light up the screen together.",0,1757121988.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
1n9mujo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9mujo,It's all a matter of perspective,"
I used to use my small spare bedroom in my apartment as a games room. I had a 68cm CRT , one of those ten space IKEA cube things, an 8 way switcher and a whole bunch of consoles connected. Whatever I felt in the mood for playing it was just a button press away. Was a pretty good setup.

Then I decided that was a lot of space for something I wasn't doing a lot of. So I turned that space into an office/workshop. Whenever I felt in the mood I'd just play on my LCD TV. It's ok for N64. And fine for GameCube onwards. And my Atari 2600 is passable, maybe because of the basic graphics and the fact no one was trying to massage extra effects from CRT anti aliasing etc.

The really weak spot is my mega drive (and maybe SNES and Jaguar, haven't played them for a while). I guess that era was the height of using the CRTs limitations to create effects. It just looks much better on a CRT.

But there isn't a lot of room in my living room for a dedicated spot for a large CRT. I have an upright arcade machine in the corner and a cocktail cab as a coffee table. I still have a stack of CRTs in my garage. It occurred to me that proportion and perspective is everything. Why not put a 34cm CRT on the cocktail cab/coffee table? The results are really good. The screen's apparent size is not much smaller than the much larger LCD further away, and it takes seconds to unplug it and put it in a cupboard. It's also quite a comfy playing position. In fact more comfy than the old games room as the 68cm always felt a tad high on the IKEA cube thing.  I'm a very happy chappy 😊

I still suggest to people who want to get into retro games that if all they have is an LCD with AV inputs, then that's still a start and not to go nuts and overspend on a CRT that someone down the track would probably have given them for free. I look it like record collecting - if your mega drive is the actual record, then an LCD TV is a cheap turntable with built in speakers. Play it that way for a while, then when you can you upgrade your equipment. And enjoy the same games all over again due to the increase in quality playback. The difference is that it almost always costs more to upgrade your stereo, but you can often upgrade your retro gaming experience with a CRT (if you're patient) for peanuts/free.

1n9msvt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9msvt,The apple saga continues with… apple kvass! Enjoyed with homemade rye crackers. Cheers to the weekend!,"I'm sure I've never said this right and I feel like a fraud trying to. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying it.

Kvass is a fermented drink. The real, real version is rye bread fermented in water with raisins added for their surface yeast. This is an apple version 😁🍎.

Just as a quick note, Kvass is NOT a lacto-ferment, it's a yeast ferment. Lacto-fermentation you do for pickles, peppers and vegetables that uses a high salt solution to discourage undesirable bacteria. I think the confusion between these fermentations is why many recipes add salt to kvass recipes. No salt is required ⛔🧂. As yeast grow (not lactobacilli!), they crowd out the unwanted organisms 🔐. You help them with this by regularly agitating/shaking the container which I suppose disrupts the structure the undesirable organisms create when they proliferate 🫨.

There are two components/ferments to making the kvass. 

1️⃣ The first ferment gets the yeast growing and producing their flavours 🌱. There will be a bit of alcohol produced during this time, but not much. For ferment 1 you need water 🌊, sugar 🍬 and yeast 🍞. The yeast will come from some sort of fruit skin 🍎. My hand picked apples have enough surface yeast, but if you’re using store bought, they might not have yeast left so you may have to add raisins 🍇 or dates which are frequently used for this purpose. You can also add a pinch of baker’s yeast. Sit this in a warm spot for 5-7 days with a breathable top like a coffee filter and shake it once every single day (definitely briefly swap it to an impermeable lid when shaking). That's it for the first ferment. Over the 5-7 days, yeast will form which you will smell 👃.

When this first ferment is complete is a matter of preference, depending on how yeasty you want the taste 🤔. For the first time, if you can smell the yeast after 5 days, maybe that's enough.

2️⃣ The second ferment carbonates 🫧. The same yeast will take care of this, but you need to put an impermeable lid on the container. The best way to do this is to filter out everything but the water and transfer the water to a plastic bottle 🍼. Drop a couple raisins in for a little extra, extra yeast. With plastic, you can squeeze the container and then put the lid on. This will leave some room for the container to expand instead of exploding if you don't burp it ⛔💥. Once the container expands back to full size, take the lid off and squeeze the container back for one more cycle. This ‘burping’ is just so the container doesn't explode. 

After two of those cycles, your kvass will be both fermented and carbonated 😋🫧 and ready to drink!

That was a long one ⌛but I think if you've got the time, introducing yourself to fermentation is a great way to spend 10 minutes. Well I hope you have a fantastic day full of bubbles and joy. Thanks for stopping in! 🫵#️⃣1️⃣

Will post the recipe soon.

Ive dealt with Chronic Fatigue for years, unsure from what. My blood tests are clear, I try to stay moving through the day but it only does so much. I sometimes can barely get through work without wanting to fall asleep, some light sensitivity, etc. My days off as so sluggish. Today especially I have just been tired and laying around all day. I get brain fog and sometimes headaches, caffeine doesnt touch me unless i have a shit ton of it but i dont have more than a cup of coffee usually. Some days I cant get through without a nap but I always wake up exhausted. 

I deal with several anxiety disorders, mainly severe OCD and AvPD, and depression. But im on medication which helps some, just doesnt help my fatigue. I will admit i dont exercise much outside of going on long walks every few days. But I used to have an ED and I always feel ill when I exercise so I stopped doing cardio or anything and havent for a couple years.

Lately, as i get closer to graduating college ive been worried about my future and maintaining a job when I get exhausted so easily. Im a journalist, and I want to keep pursuing journalism full time but I dont know if I'll be able to. My doctor doesnt really take my symptoms seriously and just attributes them to mental illness, and because I dont have a diagnosis nobody takes it seriously even though it limits me.

I want to apply for disability, but I dont have a diagnosed condition for my fatigue and my mom said that would limit my career options in the future. She basically said I will have to deal with it and push through it but that sounds miserable some days. Im worried I wont be able to maintain a job in the future and I will either end up unable to provide for myself or living with my parents most my life (which they wouldn't like).

Does anyone have advice or am I just shit out of luck? Thanks. ",4,1757121621.0,chronicfatigue,0,1.0,False
1n9mq9f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9mq9f,Honor Magic 7 Pro Review,"Part 1: Software
The Magic 7 Pro comes with MagicOS 9, which is rumored to be the ""iOS of Android"" in terms of touch and swipe experience - and there's nothing to complain about there. However, the camera app still lags when swiping like HyperOS. As for features, I'd rate it 1/10. Basic features like app cloning and app lock are fine, but when it comes to productivity and lifestyle features:
• No focus mode available, can't customize notifications per app - only on/off options, which is very annoying. Sometimes I enable it for work messages, but then messaging apps also get notifications disabled. Can't selectively choose like iOS or OneUI.
• Camera can't scan QR codes when opened directly - have to go into Honor Lens then scan code (very inconvenient).
• Notification panel can't be customized, only some YOLO suggestions can be adjusted.
• Smooth performance is there, but RAM management is terrible. Despite having 12GB RAM, apps crash frequently - previously used HyperOS with 8GB and had no such issues.
• No shortcuts app, can't automate much on the phone.
• Notifications can't be sorted or prioritized - whatever comes first jumps to the top, leading to stupidly missing messages.MagicOS 9 does have advantages, but in 2025, benefits like smoothness, animations, or app lock/APK installation are standard, so I'm sharing these drawbacks for awareness.
Part 2: Camera Good and BadThis phone is quite poor specifically for camera performance - doesn't excel in any area. Rating: 5/10
• Camera live view is terrible and pre-cropped, resulting in mediocre photo quality.
• 1x camera photos are just on par with regular Xiaomi 13, not as good as the Mi 13 Pro I used before. Has aperture but doesn't make photos special.
• 200MP tele has impressive specs like S24 Ultra and Vivo X200 Ultra, capable of 100x zoom, but anything beyond 6x is unusable. Even the S24 Ultra with default 5x 50MP can crop to 10x with sharp results, while this 200MP crops to blurry 10x. No tele macro either.
• Ultra-wide camera is trash - worse than iPhone UW, poor colors, unusable for video despite 4K 60fps capability.
• Software offers nothing useful - manual mode doesn't work for video?? WTF really, can't add LUTs despite having settings for it.
• Video quality loses to iPhone 11 - blurry and heavily cropped.
• Portrait photos have Harcourt-style colors, but sorry folks, whether it's good or bad depends on the model, but this looks bad due to the phone for sure. Photos are yellowed, portraits over-smooth the skin, and simulated bokeh is worse than iPhone 7 Plus.
• Very puzzling that with 200MP tele camera, max zoom for 4K60 is only 10x, losing to both S24U and Xiaomi 15 - one does 15x while S25 does 20x. Good hardware but software doesn't utilize it properly.

I grew up in a normal household, nothing too lavish or extravagant but not the opposite either. We had everything we needed, your normal middle income household. Both my parents are doctors. Growing up, they were really busy working so we basically grew up being taken care by our grandpa and nanny.

We stayed at the first house for a long time. It is where my parents settled after marriage, where we all grew up together. For 20+ years we stayed in that house. It was big enough for a family of 6. But when my siblings and I reached adolescence, the house became too small for us. Over the years, all our things accumulated. We used to do regular general cleanings but whenever my mom sees us throwing away things, she always scolds us really badly so we just stopped doing it. Or when we do it we make sure she doesn’t see. But since it’s not a team effort, we could only get rid of so much.

In 2018, we were asked to move out since the house was to be renovated and was due for a renewal of leasing contract. The rent tripled so the family decided to move to a bigger house instead of renewing the contract. 

We’ve been staying at this current house since 2018. I’m the one who loves cleaning and organising things so moving to this place was such a relief since we had more space and storage to keep all the clutter. Fast forward to 2023, I got engaged and moved out to live with my fiancée. Got busy in my own world since I too am a doctor and started my own private practice in 2023. I had to focus on my life and my future with my now husband

Now 2025, my family’s lease ended and has to move houses again. I went back to our family home to help with the moving but it wasn’t as easy as i thought.

The house is a complete mess, piles and piles of clutter everywhere, theres no more living room because all the couches had things on them. There’s no more dining table to have any meal since there are probably around 15 organiser tupperware on the table full of packets of coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, utensils, tissues, etc. All of which came from take outs or hotels. The house is originally a 5 bedroom but because of all the things, only 3 rooms are occupied. The other 2 is filled with things up to the brim of the door. It was such a different house compared to when I was still home with them. 

My husband and I have been the major helpers since we both can lift heavy and are both quick to organise things. It’s nothing that we can’t handle. But mom is hindering all our progress in organising things for donation or trash. She is going through every single bags, boxes, basket and would keep at least 70% of what my siblings and I organized as trash/donation. 

ITS SO FRUSTRATING CAUSE WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?! Everything she wants to keep, i’m sure she hasn’t seen in YEARS, but suddenly they have value now that it’s within her sight?! We have until just the end of this week to move out, otherwise we’d have to pay for the whole month’s rent again. But how in the world are we gonna do that if she keeps blocking all those boxes for donation?

I feel bad for dad as the main breadwinner. He already paid the rent for the new place. He’s been working so hard to provide for this family but his life choices deserves a whole other post. He’s not that strong physically, doesn’t work out and he went through a surgery a couple years back. So in terms of lifting heavy, he can’t do much. He also has troubles letting go of other things but he’s not as bad as mom in terms of hoarding. He is not as involved in organising things at home and just let us his children do the work. I could see why. 

Our contract started September 2025 for that new house and yet we are still struggling packing up the remaining things since mom keeps keeping trash. We don’t want to bring trash to that new house.

I've tried going incrementally finer than my baseline on a V60 and it remains pretty muddy. 1:16.2-16.5 

Tried going coarser through an origami at 1:15.7 which is cleaner but still lacks clarity. 

Anyone using either of these systems have any luck? Thanks in advance.",0,1757121333.0,pourover,2,0.5,False

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Desman Washington, United Nations Security forces

**Date:** \[Standardized Human Time\]: January 27, 2158

The last few hours had been some of the most boring of my life. Once we had contacted the UN to let them know about our strange encounter they had immediately issued us orders to disconnect every device on our ship from the net and to go radio silent until we could pilot ourselves to the nearest UN outpost. That had been a 12 hour flight. The only source of entertainment we had gained was when Walters realized they were going to confiscate our holopads to inspect them for any potential tampering. The look on his face had been priceless and Ruta had been nearly doubled over with laughter.

""What's wrong Walters?"" She taunted, slapping her sides with mirth, ""Afraid what they might say when they see the websites you're visiting?""

""No!"" Walters had shot back, his face visibly red with embarrassment, ""It's just that I'm supposed to call someone tonight and I don't want them to think I flaked on them."" He insisted.

""Good grief Cassius,"" I sighed, shaking my head, ""What's the flavor of the week? Is it a Mazik this time?"" Walters glared daggers at me.

""You guys are fucking assholes."" He spat, ""I don't know what you have against me for being open minded?!?""

""Is that what you think we don't like Walters?"" Sergeant Basu groaned, sitting in the pilot's seat, ""My cousin married a damned Krokotl. Sure I think it's kinda weird but you love who you love. That's not the problem we have.""

""Yeah love is one thing."" I agreed with a nod, ""But you make it… scummy. Like you're trying to flirt up a different xeno each week. That's not loving someone. That's having a fetish.""

The rest of the ride had been utterly silent as Walters fumed over our input. At last though we had made our way to Tartarus Station, one of the most far flung UN command posts but the closest to where we had been patrolling. As our shuttle made its way into one of the three massive hanger bays it was obvious they had been expecting us. Armed Human guards (as well as a handful of Venlil) stood at attention, weapons at the ready as we sat down. On the far side of the hanger a man in a UN officer's uniform, adorned with several medals, approached with an armed escort of Venlil dressed in tailor-made tactical gear.

Basu flipped the switch to lower the landing ramp and our little crew made their way to the exit. Mercifully none of the soldiers aimed their weapons at us but a few came rushing forward, demanding we hand over any electronic equipment. None of us objected, knowing that wasn't really an option. The individual with the medals came rounding about the side of the ship a moment later.

Welcome back soldiers."" He greeted. He had a few wrinkles on his face but didn't look that old, but I recognized one of the medals on his chest. It was one they gave to veterans of the Federation war. He was definitely older than he looked. ""I'm Colonel Lin Qiang, head of UN-Republic joint operations. I'm going to need you lot to follow us for debriefing.""

The lot of us quickly saluted before wordlessly following the Colonel and his Venlil guards. It was strange seeing Venlil with tactical gear and rifles. Those fluffballs sure had changed from how they were at first contact. As we walked I observed them. It was easy to tell that all of them were younger, their unbowed legs and greater size clearly signifying them as ""uncured"". Our little group was led to a small room in the interior of the station. It contained virtually nothing aside from a metal table with four chairs on one side and a single chair on the other. One of the Venlil gestured towards the four chairs on the far side of the room with his rifle and we obediently made our way over to them and sat down. Without telling us anything further the guards shut the door behind us, leaving us in the Spartan room with nothing but the soft buzzing of the single overhead light.

""What do you think this is about?"" I muttered, careful to keep my voice down as I noticed the obvious one-way mirror on the far side of the room.

""Shit are we in trouble?"" Walters murmured, his eyes darting about nervously.

""They just want to ask us questions you two."" Sergeant Basu grumbled, squirming a bit in one of the uncomfortable metal chairs, ""We haven't done anything wrong.""

""Crazy seeing Venlil all dressed up in tactical gear."" Ruta mused, seemingly unfazed by our situation, ""They look like real soldiers almost.""

""They are REAL soldiers."" Came the Colonel's voice as the door opened once more on the other side of the room. He made his way in with a stern look across his face, made only more menacing by the noticeable scar that cut its way from his chin up to just under his eye, ""And I expect you to treat the men and women under my command with the respect they deserve.""

""S… sorry Sir."" Ruta replied quickly as we noticed a second figure walk into the room. This one was a Venlil, his rifle held at the ready by his chest. Colonel Lin sat down in the seat opposite us, leaning across the table, propping his head up with his elbows as he glared down at us, seeming to size us up.

""I'm sure you can imagine that the news of a possible first contact that immediately jumps to hacking into our systems has the brass up in arms."" He growled, ""I'm going to need you to tell me what happened. In detail.""

Our group spent a few minutes going over our story with him, inserting as much detail as we could possibly recall. Once we had finished the old soldier sat silently, still staring us down.

""So Captain Hult…"" He spoke at last, turning to the Venlil guarding the door, ""What do you make out of all this?""

""This is definitely not a first contact event Sir."" The Venlil soldier replied, his rigid posture and curt reply the very definition of discipline. The Colonel cocked an eyebrow at that.

""And why do you say that?"" Lin pressed, appearing to be fishing for a specific answer.

""They mentioned that the unknown vessel made a communication BEFORE it did the scan Sir."" Captain Hult answered, ""In addition all four crewmates agree that they were able to understand what was being said. Between the three Humans and the Yotul that is a total of three different languages being spoken. If that is the case then the vessel knew enough about both Human and Yotul communication to be able to translate into all three languages without any seeming difficulty. Given that it is only logical to assume that the unknown drone's designers were intimately familiar with them.""

""Very true."" Colonel Lin replied, his face showing just a hint of satisfaction at that answer, ""However we cannot rule out the possibility that these… Directorate individuals could also have simply been observing us unseen for a long time. The Federation was well aware of Human language well before we had initiated contact after all.""

""That is true Sir."" The Venlil officer replied, his gaze never straying from straight ahead. Lin turned his gaze back towards us.

""And between you that is for certain the most information you can provide?""

""Yes Colonel,"" Sergeant Basu assured him, ""Although I'm sure the diagnostics of our onboard equipment will provide you with some better answers."" The Colonel nodded at that before glancing side-long at his companion. The Venlil seemed to take the hint, subtly reaching into his vest and pulling out a small device with a single, red button. He quickly tapped the button, causing it to light up.

""Ok."" Colonel Lin sighed, turning back to us once again, ""We only have a few minutes while that device jams the comms and video feed from the room. I need you all to listen very closely to me. This whole ordeal has the UN extremely unnerved. They don't want this information getting out to the larger SC. The political climate is already tense. Two of the SC's biggest players are having a dick measuring contest and throwing something like this in the mix will only make things more volatile.""

I looked over to Ruta knowingly. The UN had come out of the Fed wars in a distinct position of power, but so had the Yotul Technocracy. Things between the two powers had been at a slow boil for over a decade. I'd heard Ruta mention once that the Technocracy had grown upset with the UN, feeling that despite all the changes they had made they hadn't gone far enough in some areas and had pushed too hard in others. *Lost their way.* I believe she said.

""Because of that this whole thing for the time being is going to be overseen by the UN's intelligence community."" The Colonel continued, his face just barely hiding a look of disgust, ""I already know who they're going to put on this and she's a damned viper. I want you all to keep your wits about you because this bitch is the type to try and rope people in on their schemes and since you were the first to make contact with the Directorate she's almost certainly going to try and use you.""

I silently gulped the nervous saliva that had been building in my mouth as he spoke. Son of a bitch! I thought I was getting a boring patrol position. I wasn't ready to get sucked into some cloaks and daggers bullshit! Although at this point it looked like I didn't really have a choice in the matter.

""In thirty seconds the room surveillance is going to turn back on."" Colonel Lin informed us, ""You're going to be dismissed to go to a set of separate quarters set aside for you until our UN intelligence officer arrives. I strongly encourage each of you to watch what you say very carefully.""

As he finished the Vinlil captain pressed the button once more on the device he held, turning off the light on it. Without a word Colonel Lin pushed his chair back from the table and stood up before walking towards the door. Captain Hult quietly opened the door and allowed the Colonel to leave. The Venlil paused a moment, looking back at our little group intently, cocking his head to the side as he eyed us over. Then, finally, he made what I assumed was an attempt at the Human ""wink"" gesture and walked out the door, leaving us in shocked silence.

 

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Zotta, Expeditionary Fleet Xeno-Biologist

**Date:** \[Standardized Human Time\]: January 27, 2158

The evening of the 26th had been one of little sleep for me. My excitement hardly knew any bounds. I had lain in my hammock until midnight, staring at the blank, white, metal tiles that formed the ceiling to my quarters. Between the results of the genome decoding taking longer than expected and the massive amounts of corrupted data that the ship had to sift through on the data storage cube we had brought back I had found myself in a state of tormented scientific teasing! We were on the cusp of incredible discoveries and I could hardly contain myself, let alone try to sleep!

After a few hours of tossing and turning I reached over and picked up my holopad, turning it on to check the time. The soft, greenish light hurt my eyes after hours of darkness and I threw a paw over my eyes to shield them until they adjusted. After a moment I checked again through half-opened eyes.  The time on the lock screen of my pad read 2:30 am. I sighed and pulled myself up out of bed. Trying to sleep would be pointless. I sighed and made my way out of the room.

I scurried down the hallway to the commons room, quickly finding I wasn't the only one who couldn't sleep. Leo and Vakks were sitting together on the common room's sofa, watching a movie on the TV. I recognized it as an old Dossur Rom-com called ""To Aafa and Back!"". It was a corny story about a Federation representative falling in love with his transport driver.

""This is so weird."" Leo laughed, ""What do they even see in each other? The transport driver is portrayed as a slob to the extreme!""

""You gotta watch it till near the end!"" Vakks shot back, jabbing him in the ribs, ""It shows she isn't a total slob! She just acts that way cause she's scared of getting hurt again!"" The Terran looked over at her, the playful smirk evident on his face even without being able to see his predatory grin from where I stood.

""Is that why you're such a slob?"" He teased, the remark quickly cut off by a gasp as he doubled over from the blow the Skalgan delivered to his diaphragm. The sound was followed by a rambunctious, squawking laughter from nearby. I turned my gaze over to the common rooms table to find Mok'lil and Gothlir sitting there, each holding a glass.

""Hah! Tell him sister!"" The avian cawed, surprisingly stammer free. As she brought the glass in front of her to her beak and took a deep drink I thought I could gather why. The Gojid beside her looked over at her with a mix of amusement and concern but didn't say a word. His eyes drifted over to me, raising a paw in greeting and gesturing his claws for me to join them.

""Seems like none of us can sleep huh?"" Gothlir laughed as I dashed over to the table and joined the duo, bouncing my way up to the table top, ""Want some coffee or anything?"" He asked, ""I figure it would be easier for me to get it than you.""

""She's a grown woman!"" Mok'lil exclaimed, startling me once more with the sheer lack of her trademark stutter, ""Don't patronize her! You're just like my first husband! Woman aren't some delicate eggshell! We can do things for ourselves!"" The Krokotl exclaimed, swooning dangerously in her seat.

Gothlir looked at her with a clear sense of exasperation but didn't say a word, simply gesturing for me to follow him as he got up and headed towards the mess hall. I scampered along beside him, looking up at the Gojid curiously.

""Mok'lil isn't much of a drinker."" He said apologetically, looking down at me as we walked, ""Honestly though when she's a couple drinks in and her anxiety stops she's a hoot. You just happened to catch her at about seven drinks in."" I flicked my ears dismissively, letting him know it wasn't an issue.

""It's fine. Heck you guys put up with me when I drank too much of that Terran morning drink."" I laughed in reply. We rounded the corner into the kitchen and Gothlir immediately went to the sink, pouring out a glass of water into a nearby cup. He sat that aside before moving over to a small device built into the wall. The Gojid silently pulled a slot outwards on it, inserting a tiny packet from a nearby cabinet into it.

""Well you're still new around here."" Gothlir explained, ""And most of the crew have gotten pretty close. Just don't want you to feel alienated."" The Gojid looked over as the wall device began pouring the familiar, brown, Terran bean water out into a large, waiting vessel below. ""How much did Monahan give you last time?"" He asked, a clear trepidation in his voice.

""Oh! He filled one of those for me!"" I replied, pointing to the stacks of paper cups nearby.

""Fucking shit."" Gothlir laughed, ""He made it sound like you barely had any! You drank a whole Dixie cup full?"" He laughed, shaking his head, ""Ok Well I'm going to give you like… a quarter of that."" He continued, taking one of the so-called ""Dixie Cups"" and pouring it a quarter full before handing it to me. We spent a moment as he poured himself the remained of the coffee before grabbing that and the cup of water. ""Let's head back"" he suggested, ""I'll give Mok this cup of water in hopes of sobering her up just a little bit and then me and you can head down to the labs?"" He suggested. I nodded emphatically in reply as I took a tentative sip from the cup he handed me.

""Might as well."" I replied, ""I'm too excited to sleep and the genome sequencer should have finished by now."" We moved out of the room, having to move a bit slower as I was forced to move bipedal carrying my drink. As we exited the kitchen and made our way back into the common room I could see Mok'lil had made her way over to the duo on the couch and was talking to them rather loudly.

""Come on!"" She insisted with a slight hiccup, ""It will be fun! You two can sing a duet! That would be so cute."" The pair on the couch had clearly been looking for a way out of that particular conversation and turned to us excitedly as we came into the room.

""We'd love to do some karaoke Mok,"" Leo said as he stood up, ""But we promised Zotta we'd go down and help her in the lab a bit."" The Krokotl's head turned to look where Leo's gaze had turned to and found us, clacking her beak together excitedly before bounding over to us and gently wrapping a wing around me. I struggled to hold onto my coffee as she leaned in for a loose hug, thankfully still sober enough to keep from knocking me over… though not by much.

""Oh dear!"" She squawked, ""Have I shown you my chicks yet?"" She asked, standing up and going to the holopad strapped to her midsection. Behind her I could see Vakks and Leo frantically shaking their heads in the Terran ""No"" sign.

""You already did Mok."" Gothlir interjected, putting a hand on her shoulder as he handed her the glass of water, ""Why don't you drink this and try to lay down a bit?"" The Gojid put a hand on her shoulder to steady her as she took the water and nearly stumbled backwards.

""That… That would p… probably be a g….good idea."" She answered, keeping her eyes on the water as her trademark stutter seemed to return.

""You guys go ahead down to the Bio-lab. I'm gonna help Mok'lil to bed."" Gothlir said, keeping a steadying hand on her shoulder as he led her down the hall and towards her quarters.

""Oh thank stars."" Vakks sighed with relief as  she disappeared, ""She was already at stage 3 and it was only gonna take one more drink before she got to stage 4.""

""Stage… 4?"" I replied  curiously as I took another drink.

""Oh yeah."" Vakks laughed, ""We always tease that Mok gets drunk in stages. Stage 1 she drops the stutter and loosens up. Stage 2 she gets loud and boisterous. Stage 3 she starts trying to get everyone to do karaoke and gets all touchy-feely with hugs and stuff…""

""And stage 4 she gets…"" Leo jumped in, visibly cringing, ""flirty."" I cocked my head at that, genuinely curious now to see what THAT was like. It was hard enough to imagine what I'd just seen, let alone imagining that anxious avian flirting with someone.

""She gets like that again and I'm gonna sock her right in the beak."" Vakks grumbled.

""Oh chill out."" Leo sighed, rolling his eyes, ""You know she doesn't mean any of it and she's mortified when you bring it up to her the next day.""

""Whatever."" Vakks huffed, her thin nostrils flaring with visible frustration, ""Let's just get down to the lab."" I laughed a bit at her reaction. Had Mok'lil tried flirting with HER before? I took a quick sip of my bean water before looking up to Leo.

""Would you mind carrying me?"" I asked sheepishly, ""It's a bit of a walk and it's rather awkward doing it while carrying my drink.""

""Sure thing chipmunk."" Leo laughed, leaning down and letting me step onto his hand before gently depositing me on his shoulder. I heard the Human take a quick sniff, looking at me out of the corner of his eye as we started towards the lab.

""Is that coffee?"" He asked with a hint of a smirk, ""Can't wait to see you bouncing off the walls again.""

""I wasn't THAT bad!"" I squeaked indignantly, ""But yes it is *coffee*. I just like the energy it gives me.""

A quick trip down the elevator later and we found ourselves stepping into the lab. A small, green light on the genome sequencer announcing it had finished its job. I hurriedly slurped down the last of the coffee before dropping the cup off of Leo's shoulder and into a nearby waste bin. As we got to the sequencer I didn't bother waiting to be let down, instead leaping from his shoulder to the desk and rushing over to the display screen on the device.

As I looked over the results I couldn't stifle a gasp. 1,000 chromosome pairs?!?! No wonder the sequencer had taken so long to decode it!

""Holy hell."" Leo muttered, giving an appreciative whistle as he gazed at the screen over my shoulder.

""What is it?"" Vakks asked, cocking her head in confusion as she looked at the screen, ""What's so impressive?""

""Ba… Vakks…""Leo stammered, trying to explain it, ""That's an INSANELY huge amount of DNA. If I remember right the creature with the highest amount of genomes on Earth is a species of fern and it only has around 700 pairs. Among sentient races the Kolshians have the most recorded and I think they only have something like 50 pairs!""

""That's correct."" I muttered, trying to parse through even of a fraction of the data the machine had recorded. ""Not to mention the telomeres on the DNA strands are…. They don't seem to be natural. Those protein sequences shouldn't be possible given everything we know about how DNA forms.""

""Did I miss anything interesting?"" Came the voice of our Gojid friend as he stepped into the lab.

""I don't know how to even explain this…"" I muttered to myself as I continued pouring through the information on the screen, ""It will take years just to make sense of all this."" A thought occurred to me as I quickly opened the top of the sequencer and, using a nearby pair of tongs, picked up the sample within and deposited it into the sample jar I had emptied it from earlier. I sat that aside and nervously picked up one of the samples I had taken from one of the smaller creatures on the ship. I clicked the ""Sterilize"" button on the sequencer and waited a moment as the sample tray in the machine's top quickly burned the inner surface to remove any leftover genetic material. As the tray opened once more I deposited the new sample with more than a bit of trepidation.

""That the sample from the smaller creature?"" Gothlir asked, chomping into one of the small, dried meat sticks the Terrans had brought on board. I hadn't realized he had been de-cured.

""Yes."" I answered as I shut the tray and set the sequencer to run once more. ""Let's hope this one has a shorter genome."" I said, my voice cracking as I thought of what it would mean if I found it to be the same.

Then beer and liquor. Now mainly liquor.

He is drinking way too much & i don’t want him to become a full blown alcoholic, tho im sure he already is. 
These things have become a real issue and we’ve had multiple conversations about it. I’ve been mean, I’ve been nice and understanding. Nothing has gotten through to him that it’s an issue. There’s always an excuse. 
Most recently, we had a convo & i told him i want to leave him if he doesn’t get this figured out & i think that hurt him a little and he stopped for a few weeks but now it’s the same.

Welp, I grew up in a Mormon family and my mom told me her dad used to drink “Pero”, it’s a coffee alternative with no caffeine. So I went out on a limb and bought me some and to me, it tastes VERY SIMILAR. Like, if coffee was a 10, PERO would be an 8.

1n9m9xu,https://i.redd.it/vp1s7oin0gnf1.jpeg,How Lululemon fell out of fashion — the economist,"
Sep 4th 2025

https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/04/how-lululemon-fell-out-of-fashion

Lululemon athletica, a brand famous for flogging leggings for over $100 apiece, has long been in vogue among investors as well as fashionistas. Over the past decade the “athleisure” firm has reported operating margins of 15-25%, well ahead of rivals, in part owing to the vast share of sales it makes directly to customers. Its sales per square foot of shop space have reached around $1,500 a year, also far outstripping other retailers. Lululemon’s stretchy trousers and chic sweatshirts have married comfort and fashion for a new breed of home workers who wanted to look sharp but relaxed on conference calls.




Fashion, however, is famously fickle. Analysts are expecting more bad news when second-quarter results are revealed on September 4th, after The Economist is published. This would add to the woes revealed for the three-month period to May 4th, when Lululemon reported declining sales in the Americas, its most important region. It has already cut earnings guidance for the full year and its shares have fallen by 45% since January (see chart 1). What is going wrong for the king of athleisure?



After the brand was established in Vancouver at the turn of the millennium, Lululemon quickly became the cool kid of sports retail, offering an alternative to Adidas and Nike, the industry’s behemoths. Today it is the third-biggest company in a global sportswear industry that is worth $446bn by net sales, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley, an investment bank (see chart 2). As recently as 2016, it barely made the top ten.

Despite this growth, Lululemon has not managed to interest existing customers in its latest products. The brand expanded into new areas, including shoes and regular casualwear, and has started making gear emblazoned with logos in an attempt to woo youngsters, who like that sort of thing. But as Randy Konik at Jefferies, an investment bank, says: “They are putting out products that their core customers look at and say ‘who’s going to wear this?’”
Nor is Lululemon creating the buzz that might attract new clientele. It spends only 5% or so of revenues on marketing, preferring word-of-mouth endorsements. On, a Swiss rival, devotes around 10%, signing up celebrity ambassadors, such as Zendaya, an American actress, and collaborating with trendy labels, such as Loewe. That may help explain why visits to Lululemon’s American shops dropped by over 8% in the second quarter of 2025, according to Placer.ai, a location-analytics firm. Even in China, where the firm had been growing fast, sales are now slowing.

Fashion trends have not helped. Gone are the days when fashionistas worth their Vogue subscription wore Lululemon leggings for the coffee run, school run or just to run. Hotter rivals, such as Alo and Vuori, are gaining ground. Worse still, fashion editors have pronounced that fitted clothes are out and baggy ones are in. Not only that but a survey of 10,000 customers in 13 countries last year found that 48% of consumers were wearing denim more often than before.
Then there is the economic backdrop. Lululemon operates in 25 countries and has more than 750 shops worldwide. But three-quarters of its revenues come from the Americas. In March Calvin McDonald, the company’s boss, warned investors that concerns about inflation and the economy were making all-important American shoppers “more cautious”.

Lululemon is also vulnerable to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Last year some 40% of its products were made in Vietnam and almost 30% of its fabrics came from mainland China, two countries that have been hit hard by new duties. Mr Trump’s decision to get rid of the “de minimis” waiver, which exempted from custom duties goods in parcels worth under $800, could raise prices and hurt sales. Ike Boruchow at Wells Fargo, another bank, reckons that about half of Lululemon’s American e-commerce orders had benefited from the waiver. Lululemon declined to comment on Mr Boruchow’s suggestion.


The king of athleisure, therefore, has turned to discounting. That hardly bodes well for the reputation of the firm, but its strategists have been left with little choice: inventories jumped by 23% year on year in the first quarter of 2025, while sales rose by just 7%. Analysts at Jefferies reckon that more than 60% of cut-price items at its outlet stores are now core products, such as its famed black leggings.

Lululemon has encountered one more problem of late. The brand’s sportswear is easy to copy. Earlier this year the firm sued Costco, a big retailer, for selling cut-price versions of its trousers and other items. In years to come, the firm’s executives might look back wistfully at the days when it was seen as a brand worth copying. ■",1,1757120256.0,u_raytoei,0,1.0,False

I then put my grounds in and tamp firmly, then add another dry filter atop the coffee. This seems to work fine, however I also tried one without the top filter and noticed a disturbance in the top of the puck after brewing.

The same is true in the digital space.  In the [personal branding](http://www.ohhmybrand.com) niche.

Personal branding goes beyond polished photographs or flashy titles; it lies in the substance of your content - the thoughts you choose to share, the knowledge you distil, and the values you express.

Quality content is the quiet foundation of trust. It does not scream for attention; it earns it. When your words, videos, or ideas resonate, they begin to do what no introduction or business card can - they create recall. Over time, people are remembered less for what they claim and more for what their content makes others feel, learn, or question.

This video explores why quality should take precedence over quantity, how consistency shapes credibility, and why storytelling remains the oldest yet most effective tool in personal branding. It is about building a voice that is authentic, relevant, and enduring - one that reflects who you are and what you stand for.

If you are a professional striving to stand apart, an entrepreneur seeking trust, or an individual wishing to be remembered for more than a title, this conversation will help you reflect on how you create and share your content.

What do I do?","Location: California

In November 2023, I was injured at work while lifting a broken 5-gallon coffee cambro with a coworker. It was broken and spilled hot water onto me, fell, and knocked/threw me to the ground. I went to the hospital, was off for almost 3 weeks, and came back with light duty restrictions. Management told me I couldn’t return until I was fully healed, and I later learned I should have been allowed to return with accommodations.

When I returned, upper management questioned me about the incident but never gave me a DWC-1 form. Since then, I’ve had sciatica with severe flare-ups, and my doctor is treating me. I only recently learned that by law, I should have been given a DWC-1 right away.

When I called HR, they said they had no report on file. They seemed concerned, marked my case as urgent, and said I’d hear back within 48 hours — but I never did. Now, one of the same managers who questioned me back in 2023 has scheduled a meeting with me.

I’m scared because I don’t want to be fired or retaliated against. What should I say or do to protect myself in this meeting?

I tried to make this as short and clear as possible and I’m happy to give details if it will help. I just really don’t want them to fire me. ",1,1757120161.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

He wasn't wrong, I was 100lbs heavier than when we first started dating.... but so was he.


I first got help for my mental health, which made it possible to control my depression that  had caused the binge eating, and then started at the gym, and I'm happy to report 20 months later, as of today, I am officially down 100lbs. 


I totally changed every aspect of my life, I don't binge eat, I make better choices, I track my calories, and I'm exercising every single day. I also go hiking which would have sounded like a nightmare 20 months ago. I'm training for a Halloween 5k, which is never something I'd **ever** thought I'd say in a million years.


It truly was a lifestyle change and I have no plans to stop or go back to my old ways. I have a cute hourglass figure, I have a ton of energy, my libido is back, and I am happier, hotter, and more confident than I have ever been in my entire life.


Husband is so happy to have a hot wife who looks amazing on his arm and it blows his mind how high my libido is, to the point he can't keep up with me.


But unfortunately, he's not *completely* happy. Because he's still 100lbs over weight. He hasn't changed a single thing, not diet, not exercise, nothing. 


Additionally, now he is paranoid about me leaving him, and getting jealous that I get a hell of a lot more attention than I ever have. In public, guys hit on me, ladies hype me up, and it honestly feels great. It really feels like an Ugly Duckling glow-up. I get treated better at work, my social life has picked up, I got out with my friends all the time now.


Husband, however, does not. I can't remember the last time he's gone out with friends, only times he goes out is with me or work events.


The entire time I'm out, he watches my location. I know this because I call him like ""Hi honey! On my way home!""

And he'll say, ""Yeah I know, I'm watching."" 


He makes weird comments like ""Where did you get that bruise on your leg? It looks like a guy's handprint."" Or ""Why are you putting on perfume before going to the store?"" Or ""Why are you wearing makeup to meet your friend for coffee?"" 

The other day I bought myself a cute Halloween  Squishmallow and when I was holding it while watching a scary movie he asked ""Please don't let me find out that's a gift from your boyfriend.""


1. Bruises are from rock climbing at the gym

2. I wear perfume daily

3. I wear makeup because I feel pretty

4. Nope, no boyfriend, I'm still completely loyal to you. I have *never* given you reason to not trust me, I have never hidden anything from your or lied to you.


I keep my phone unlocked, I don't delete anything, you have my passwords, I'm haven't nor will I ever cheat on you. 


I'm sorry that my glow-up, from the ultimatum you gave me, is so hard on you, but I have never been happier. I'm not going to stop living my life, I'm not going back to how things used to be. If you're insecure, that's between you and you.

1n9m7v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WouldYouRather/comments/1n9m7v1/wyr_upon_death_become_a_spirit_guard_or_a_spirit/,WYR: Upon death become a Spirit Guard or a Spirit Tool,"You died and you have two choices (it almost certainly lasts an eternity, see details below).

1.) You become a ""Guardian"".

Your body is reconstructed and you become deathless (can be injured but heals fast). Your body is your peak physical body (enhanced if you were not physically fit in life). You cannot go back to the mortal realm. Instead you are assigned to guard one of the different celestial gates (Gate to Hell, Gate to Heaven, Gate to the Mortal Realm, etc.). 

As a guardian, you are to stand there guarding the gates from those illegally wanting to go in and wanting to go out. You do not need to rest, sleep, nor eat. You don't get exhausted, hungry, nor thristy. You can chat with fellow guards sparsingly, but your attention must be to the gate you're guarding. You maybe assigned to a different gate at any time and upon which you are transported there immediately. You cannot leave an assigned post, trying to do so will fail. You may be assigned as a 2-4 man group, depending on the activities at a gate.

As part of being a guard you are to stamp down any disturbance at the gates like a rampaging demon or a belligerent specter, you can get injured (but wont die) and you heal must faster than normal (loose limbs can be re-attached or parts regrown but it will take time). If you need time to recuparate you do so at the gates while continue guarding it. 

Occassionally you get assigned as an usher, a scribe (under the command of another being), or as maintenance (demon-guts clean-up and general upkeep along the gates).

Failure to do your duties properly results in your body getting disentigrated, and your spirit will be punished.

You cannot quit your post voluntarily, instead you have to wait until a new soul chooses to become a Guardian.

2.) You become a ""Tool"".

Your soul is trapped in the mortal realm, and you become a wandering spirit that is accessible by a select few mortals called ""Spirit Wielders"", who can get you to bind with them to be their ""Spirit Tool"". The wielder can see you and is the only one who can initiate a binding, you cannot choose who to be bound with. When bounded you are loyal to the wielder and must follow their commands until they release you or they die. You cannot defy your bounded wielder regardless if you agree with their actions/personality/interests or not.

As a ""Spirit Tool"", you can give skills/abilities/experties you had when you are alive to the wielder, if you were a dancer the wielder gets to dance better, if you were a finance manager, the wielder gets better at analyzing finances, etc. Your spirit also enhances things they already have (skills/abilities/expertise) that you may not possess, and your binding manifests unique combat abilities that the wielder can use against other wielders if the need arises. This combat ability is unique to you and the wielder's combination, being bound to another wielder later may not result in the same ability. Your and your wielder's expertise with this combat ability needs to be practiced and trained between the two of you to maximize it's potential, compatibility with the wielder also enhances this ability.

As a ""Spirit Tool"", you can converse with your Wielder and vice versa, and your are bound to provide them your loyal service, advice, and opinion (if asked) and you are compelled to keep the person from doing harm to themselves. You do not need to rest so you are actively watching them 24/7. You get to see whatever they are doing and they are aware of it. Certain powers/abilities will allow you to be away from the wielder but you are still aware of what is happening to them and can ""snap back"" to their location if need be.

People with a third eye who are not wielders can see you but interacting with them would be your choice. You also have the ability to affect your surrounding but this only becomes potent when you are commanded by your wielder to do so, or in acting in your wielder's benefit (stopping a thrown object to hit your wielder, bringing him a cup of coffee, holding an umbrella for them, etc.)

You only stop being a ""Spirit Tool"" if the wielder dies or chooses to release you, and then you are available to be bound by another ""Spirit Wielder"". You cannot voluntarily stop being an available Spirit, but if there are other souls that wishes to take your place you can trade your post and your soul can finally go to rest.",1,1757120077.0,WouldYouRather,3,1.0,False
1n9m790,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1n9m790/tifu_picking_walnuts/,TIFU Picking Walnuts.,"   We begin our tale first with the fickle mistress of context. I am pale as they come, unblemished by the sun as Sméagol, but with prophylactic vitamin D. Also those in the know about walnut picking will already know that it's largely more ""walnut picking *up*"" than say yoinking them off the tree, but then those in the know also already know exactly where this is going and are already laughing at me, so let's get the rest of us all up to speed. 

   Walnuts. Glorious drupes- and yes drupes, the same sort of plant thing as the peach or apricot, or more similarly, the pecan, since what we eat of both of those is the meat inside their pit. Now this begs the question; if they're like peaches, what is their actual *fruit* like? Well I'm so glad you asked.

   In a word? Brown.

   In an actual explanation, certainly unfit for consumption. It has a thick green and lumpy outer skin like you bumped the contrast on an unripe avocado, or perhaps simply a lime bumpy, stippled, and dare I say ribbed for her pleasure; the inside flesh is a pale buttery color for exactly half a second after being cut into as like an apple it oxidizes. With gusto. The juices that come out are absolutely laden with Juglone, Plumbagin, and tannins. *These are dyes.* Orange to dark brown dyes. And because they seep in, then oxidize, or perhaps just because they feel like it, they are wonderful stains, inks, and whatever else you do with dyes.

   I, as with many of my fellow nerds on this site (read: all of us) have too many interests and hobbies. Drawing, writing letters, art, fountain pens, tinkering, all of these are relevant in some way to ink, pigments, dyes. My grandma's property has two big black walnut trees. Excellent specimens. So I put on my nitrile gloves for picking up this years earliest fallen drupes. Good ol hospital gloves. We have plenty of boxes, after all, Good to keep my hands clean. So I thought.

   Half of a 5 gallon bucket later, I sat down on the basement stairs and got to work with a pocket knife, saving the flesh in one bucket and the nuts in another. Didn't stop until I was done. And off went the now deeply stained gloves. And off then, I saw my deeply stained thumbs. What I thought was my glove sweat was juices, dyes, the walnut *stain* kept moist and against my skin for the better part of 4 hours, developing into shades everywhere from incumbent US president to frostbite victim.

   Is it the first time I've picked walnuts? Certainly not. But next time I decide to cut them or peel of that skin? Yeah. I'm doubling up on the gloves. 


TL;DR: Liking nut made me black.

*More serious* TL;DR: Cutting the skins off of black walnuts left my thumbs stained colors from orange to coffee brown.",28,1757120028.0,tifu,8,0.85,False

*Ever encountered that one person who seems to have an opinion about everything you do? The colleague who constantly critiques others' choices, the family member who lectures about ""right"" and ""wrong,"" or the team member who appoints themselves as the behavior police? You're not alone. Let's explore practical strategies for dealing with these challenging personalities.*

## Understanding the Pattern 🔍

We all know them - those individuals who seem compelled to comment on everyone else's actions, decisions, and lifestyle choices. They might criticize your work methods, question your personal decisions, or offer unsolicited advice about how you should live your life. These behaviors often stem from their own insecurities, need for control, or genuine belief that they're helping others improve.

The key insight? Their behavior says more about them than it does about you.

## Why People Become Judgmental Critics 🤔

Several factors drive this tendency:

**Control Needs**: When people feel powerless in their own lives, they sometimes compensate by trying to influence others' behaviors and choices.

**Fear-Based Thinking**: Anxiety about uncertainty can manifest as rigid thinking patterns where there's only one ""right"" way to do things.

**Learned Patterns**: Some individuals grew up in environments where criticism was disguised as care, making this their default communication style.

**Perfectionism**: High personal standards can spill over into expectations for others, leading to constant evaluation and commentary.

**Social Validation**: Pointing out others' flaws can temporarily boost one's own sense of superiority or competence.

## Daily Life Strategies That Actually Work ✨

### The Redirect Technique
When someone starts lecturing you about your choices, redirect the conversation back to them:
- ""That's an interesting perspective. What's working well in your current approach?""
- ""I appreciate your concern. How are things going with your own projects?""
- ""Thanks for sharing. What strategies have you found most effective in your experience?""

### The Information Diet 📊
Limit what personal information you share with habitual critics. They can't comment on what they don't know about. Keep conversations focused on:
- Work-related topics in professional settings
- General interests rather than personal struggles
- Positive developments rather than challenges you're facing

### The Boundary Setting Method
Establish clear limits without being confrontational:
- ""I understand you have thoughts about this. I've got it handled.""
- ""I appreciate your input. I'm comfortable with my current approach.""
- ""Thanks for caring. I'll keep that in mind as I move forward.""

### The Validation Flip 💫
Instead of defending yourself, acknowledge their concern while maintaining your autonomy:
- ""I can see why you might think that. Here's what I'm considering...""
- ""You raise an interesting point. I've weighed several factors...""
- ""That's definitely one way to look at it. My situation requires...""

## Workplace Applications 💼

**During Team Meetings**: When a colleague consistently questions your methods, prepare by documenting your reasoning beforehand. Present your approach with confidence and data when possible.

**Project Collaboration**: Create clear role definitions and communication protocols. When criticism becomes excessive, refer back to agreed-upon responsibilities and processes.

**Performance Reviews**: Focus on results and outcomes rather than methods. If your approach delivers results, let the data speak for itself.

**Email Communications**: Keep responses brief and professional. Avoid over-explaining your decisions, which can invite more criticism.

## Family Dynamics Management 🏠

**Holiday Gatherings**: Prepare conversation redirects in advance. Have topics ready that shift focus away from personal choices.

**Regular Interactions**: Set visiting boundaries that work for your mental health. Shorter, more frequent interactions often work better than extended exposure.

**Decision Sharing**: Consider whether family members need to know about major life decisions before you've fully committed to them.

**Support System**: Build relationships with family members who accept you as you are, creating a buffer against constant criticism.

## Building Your Inner Resilience 🛡️

### The Perspective Check
Remember that people's criticism often reflects their own anxieties and limitations rather than objective truth about your situation. Their discomfort with your choices doesn't make those choices wrong.

### The Energy Protection Practice
Develop mental strategies to maintain your emotional equilibrium:
- Take three deep breaths before responding to criticism
- Mentally repeat: ""Their opinion is about them, not me""
- Focus on your own goals and values rather than their expectations

### The Growth Mindset Approach
Use interactions with difficult people as opportunities to strengthen your communication skills and emotional boundaries. Each encounter is practice for handling future challenges.

## Long-Term Relationship Strategies 🌱

### The Patience Investment
Some people change over time, especially when they realize their criticism isn't achieving the desired effect. Consistent, calm responses can gradually shift dynamics.

### The Distance Decision
Sometimes the healthiest choice is to limit contact with persistently negative individuals. This isn't giving up - it's protecting your mental resources for more positive relationships.

### The Team Dynamics Improvement
In work settings, consider whether addressing the pattern with management might improve overall team effectiveness. Document specific instances where criticism impacts productivity.

## When to Seek Additional Support 🆘

If dealing with judgmental individuals significantly impacts your daily life, work performance, or mental health, consider:

- Speaking with a counselor about developing stronger communication strategies
- Discussing workplace dynamics with HR if the behavior affects your job performance
- Joining support groups for people dealing with difficult family relationships
- Working with a coach to build confidence in your decision-making

## The Bigger Picture Perspective 🎯

Remember that you cannot control other people's behaviors, opinions, or reactions. You can only control your responses and the boundaries you establish. Focus your energy on:

- Making decisions aligned with your values and goals
- Building relationships with people who support your growth
- Developing skills that serve your long-term success
- Creating environments where you can thrive

Most importantly, recognize that someone else's need to criticize and control doesn't obligate you to defend, explain, or change your choices. Your life is yours to live, and you have the right to make decisions that work for your unique circumstances.

## Moving Forward with Confidence 🚀

The goal isn't to change difficult people - that's beyond your control. The goal is to develop strategies that allow you to maintain your peace of mind, pursue your objectives, and build the life you want, regardless of others' commentary.

Every interaction with challenging personalities is an opportunity to strengthen your own emotional intelligence, communication skills, and personal boundaries. These abilities will serve you well in all areas of life, from professional advancement to personal relationships.

Remember: the most powerful response to someone else's need to control is your own calm confidence in your choices and your ability to stay focused on what truly matters to you.
