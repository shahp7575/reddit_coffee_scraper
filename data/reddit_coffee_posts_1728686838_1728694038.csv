I’ve had the Nespresso Vertuo gifted from my boyfriend for the past two years. From a functionality perspective and convenience it is perfect in the sense where it brews a very good quality espresso shot

However, one thing I’m struggling with is making an iced vanilla latte that is on par with coffee shops (whether it be Starbucks, Dunkin, or independent chain).

I feel like I’ve tried everything and I referred to multiple recipes on social media, but I still can’t seem to nail it. I tend to use unsweetened almond milk as my milk choice as I tend to avoid dairy unless for special occasions. 

I’m just wondering on what espresso pod would be best for this(I currently am loyal to altisso), what milk brand would be best (I’ve had oat milk before but it’s bloating to me so I tend to avoid), and what syrups to use (I’ve tried monin vanilla syrup, coffee mate French vanilla creamer, torani vanilla syrup, torani white chocolate syrup, and all of these seem to have a weird aftertaste).

1g1ojxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavvyFridays/comments/1g1ojxc/lg_nanocell_black_friday_deal_2024/,LG NanoCell Black Friday Deal 2024,"Welcome, everyone. I hope you're having a good day. I've got some electrifying news that'll make your Black Friday even brighter. I just unearthed an absolute gem of a deal on the **LG NanoCell** TV that's been flying under the radar. If you're in the market for a visual feast, you need to [witness it firsthand](https://savvyfridays.com/deal/lg-nanocell/)!


I've been basking in the glory of my LG NanoCell for months now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The colors are so vivid, it's like someone cranked up the saturation on reality itself. I'm talking about reds that pop like fireworks and blues so deep you could dive right in. And don't even get me started on the blacks – they're darker than my coffee on a Monday morning.


What really blows my mind is the 4K resolution. I swear, sometimes I forget I'm watching TV and think I'm peering through a crystal-clear window. The other day, I was watching a nature documentary, and I could count the individual hairs on a lion's mane. It's that crisp.


But here's the kicker – the smart features are like having a tech-savvy buddy always ready to hang out. Voice control? Check. Seamless streaming? You bet. It's like the TV reads my mind, suggesting shows I didn't even know I wanted to watch.


Now, I love my current NanoCell so much that I'm seriously considering snagging another one with this deal. Maybe for the bedroom? Or perhaps I'll surprise my parents – they're still squinting at their ancient tube TV.


The sound quality deserves a standing ovation too. It's rich and immersive, making you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. Whether it's the whisper of leaves in a tense scene or the thunderous roar of an action sequence, this TV delivers.


So, if you've been on the fence about upgrading your viewing experience, now's the time to leap off. This Black Friday deal on the LG NanoCell is a rare opportunity to bring home a slice of visual paradise without breaking the bank. Trust me, your eyes (and your family movie nights) will thank you.

I ate breakfast, had a coffee and I felt fine up until now.

Idk if it’s anxiety or if I picked something up. I went out last night with my friends to a restaurant for a quick dinner, I had hot chips, coke and a halloumi stick which was so good. I do have exams coming up for the end of the year which goes towards what university/college I could get into, so it could be anxiety progressively getting worse towards the exams.

1g1odz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1g1odz5/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Him: Just drove by (my favourite coffee spot) in (my neighborhood) after finishing work, and thought of you. How was your week?

Me: Hey, it was busy and productive. Managed to get a few nice walks in on the trails. How about you?

Him: Busy week at work. In the city tonight, and maybe tomorrow night. Might go to the football game tomorrow. Do you have any plans for the long weekend?

Me: That sounds like fun, hopefully it will be nice out! I'm just having supper with family then tomorrow I might go to a craft fair with my Mom

I keep trying to say this to her that I can't afford to bring her to the movies (which is extremely embarrassing)after I already took her out and she just says ok then keeps asking.

Enjoy reading a novel of my romantic life.,"Another story of mine that hopefully will help someone who could be in a similar situation. When I was [18M] I got diagnosed with cancer (ALL) and started undergoing chemo. My treatment would last for the next 4 years. An awful and isolating ordeal on it's own. My best friend at the time, Diana [18F] whom I was friends with all our lives. We met very early on in childhood grew close in high-school where I told her I liked her freshman year. I was head over heels and stupid for her. Now we were teenagers and teenagers are dumb by nature so I don't fault her. During this time she'd go back and forth with me, giving me attention and coaxing me in with hugs and embraces. She'd try and hold my hand on several occasions. I never took this as seriouse reciprocation of feeling since she'd tell others she liked someone else. This would go on even after she got a BF. We kept at this dumb dance until senior year. During senior year something changed, idk if it was because I had joined wrestling and was super fit or because I had made more friends including striking up a friendship with her BFF, Isabel [16F]. We had a one year age difference at the time and i really liked her. She was smart, funny, and her personality was precious and warm. Not to mention she was beautiful lol. We hung out as a trio since I had a car and we'd go everywhere together. We even went back to school shopping for our last year. I have so many fond memories of all of us hanging out. The point where everything changed is when I Diana was out with her BF and my cousin putting up flyers for a school event and Isabel and I were tasked with putting up a stack too. We decided the smartest way to go about this was with a staple gun and so we went on to find one. We had good results but because we took time to get the staple gun we didn't put up as many. When we met up with the group, Diana didn't like that we still had a few sheets left and they had put them all up. She asked us what we did the whole time and we responded honestly. We were driving to leave her BF at his house when the argument peaked. Isabel and I had discussed me trying Puerto Rican food prior and I was all in on that plan. When the argument peaked we were a few blocks away from Diana's BF's house, she had me stop and let them out. Isabel and I continued with the plan and went to Starbucks after. This was when iced coffees were $2.80, good times lol. We talked and she called Diana, they made up. Isabel did ask me at one point if I still had feelings for Diana to which I said no. My answer was truthfull. Things really changed after this day. Diana and I hung out shortly after and I don't know how or why we came to the topic of our feelings and past feelings. We talked a lot and ended up arranging to hangout again the next day. I almost regret hanging out with her on this day. It spelled out the course of my romantic life for years to come. She still had a BF and it's what kept me thinking this was innocent and a heart to heart. We ended up making out and holding hands while we drove around general sillyness whole driving. I still feel conflicted and don't know if any of this was genuine. Once this day was over, we'd see each other more often. I'd take her to work which meant kisses in my car and sometimes I'd pick her up from work. Genuinely I feel sick thinking about this now because she worked with her BF. We kept this up until one day we were sitting at the Starbucks parking lot and I guess she notices I was treating her differently to which she said, ""Stop doing that, I'm not your girlfriend."". I won't lie, I don't know how deep a gash these words cut. Deep enough so that years later I still remember them. My relationship with Isabel suffered during this time. She put distance between us and was convinced I had lied to her when I told her I no longer had feelings for Diana. Thing is I was being truthfull but I let myself get overtaken by the desire of being with Diana. A foolish and gross miscalculation.  Something else happened between them to which I'm not privy to but it severely impacted their relationship and seemingly they weren't friends anymore. Shortly after this, my birthday came around and it still haunts me to this day. 3 weeks later I had a port installed and was already taking pills and getting infusions of chemo. I never got a chance to go to prom, not that I wanted to though. I never attended graduation either. At this point I moved and became neighbors with Diana. She came over and we ate chocolates at my kitchen table. Another reason why my view on romance is so messed up and why I don't trust anyone with regards to feelings. Whole splitting a Toblerone she was going on about how she could she herself with me. Telling me about how she wanted to have kids with me and how awesome our life together would be. I was such a stupid boy, I believed her entirely. I was vulnerable as my other friends went off to college and I never saw them again by the end of the summer. Diana saw me through the worst of treatment and we would hangout weekly. At first she told me she felt like we were dating and she would be so touchy with me. By the way don't think she didn't have a BF she still had the same one! We kept this up for years. She changed jobs and would meet new guys. I had asked her to be my gf the same day she told me all that stuff about our lives. She rejected me even though we were in bed. I really should have cut my losses right then and there. I think she rejected me because she didn't want to be seen with me as her BF, imagine dating the cancer guy right lmao. For her birthdays I would go all out and get her balloons and treat her to dinner or breakfast. Even during the pandemic I had set a doordash scheduled delivery for her birthday. I had preselected a milkshake made from her favorite chocolate to automatically arrive at her door along with food. She texted me and told me how she was crying at receiving this. If anyone reading this is a girl, yea he can do better and there's nothing holding him back from giving you the most romantic shit. I sent flowers from my hospital bed in 2017, so there's no excuses lol. Towards the end of this arc I was drained. I treated her far better than she actually deserved and at the cost of my friendship with Isabel I stuck around moving heaven and Earth for her, I even went as far as doing her hw during college while I was in and out of the hospital. Something else I truly regret. I really do think that cancer broke me, it broke my will and decimated my strength and shattered my hope. She was the hope I clung to. I don't know and will never know if she understood the pedestal she put herself on top in my eyes. Diana would go onto talk to other guys and go out. I finally had the strength to confront her and finally cut off the line when I was 21, when I was finally free of cancer treatment. It took me 4 long years to rally the strength to do this and at the end of it I was a broken person. I still am to an extent, broken and unable to trust or even consider the concept of love. I think about it often but I can't bring myself to seek it out, I feel the equivalent of negative G-force whenever I try to take a step to approach dating. That's it, my romantic  life story. I'm 25 now and well I'm still in the same boat. I just can't bring myself to try to date. Even with friends encouragement I can't do it. 

If you read this far, I invite you to leave a comment mentioning how dumb I am. Or leave some advice. I'd certainly welcome it. It felt good writing this and telling strangers on the internet lol. ",1,1728692484.0,self,0,1.0,False

Now I’d been monitoring my blood ketones and notice I was drastically lower when I was drinking the Diet Coke (assuming due to insulin spike) and eating the net zero wraps. So I cut that crap out and now my only source of carbs is probably from my coffee creamer. The weight loss seems to be picking up again. All and all down around 20lbs since the start.

The next headline was about some local psycho jock and his girlfriend getting arrested for torturing multiple animals to death on video. Strikes one and two and I hadn’t even showered yet. 

During breakfast I wondered if that OB1 barrier placing company is charging the city rent for every one of those things that they put out ? You know - when they just choke the roads right across town in the worst ways possible with dozens of hilariously placed orange barriers days or weeks before even showing up to do any work .. I mean if I could get away with it I would. 

 After coffee I left the house to ride my bike to work , at the end of my street was this totally trashed looking lady in a half a ripped shirt dragging the majority of a shitty old bike across the road .. she kinda looked like maybe she’d been hit or crashed - or maybe crackhead I dunno … I had to make sure she wasn’t just trying to get home after a serous wipe out or something ..  when I asked her if she was okay she screamed incoherently at me me in a very angry cracked out kinda way so I rode away . Had to make sure. 

 When I got to the end of the avenue there were two people walking in the middle of a busy three lane road stopping all the cars in their chosen lane - barely able to stand as they slowly shambled along the road so wasted drunk that remaining vertical required their combined effort. I rode around them and didn’t look back because that early in the morning nobody needs to see faces that sad. 

 I rode another block and around the corner and there was bearded dude sitting on the sidewalk up against the wall of the corner store , enjoying the sun with his pants at his ankles, his stained ripped tighty whities on display busy blazing away at something that’s definitely wasn’t weed in his little pipe ,  just sit dancing through it all like he had a hardcore techno concert album in one ear and slayer in the other ear. Big morning vibes. 

A few blocks later I get to work and get inside and minutes later some dude walks up and starts dry heaving into the planter on the sidewalk right out front , for minutes - like scream puking it out but nothing coming out. great. Strike six and I haven’t even been awake for two hours. 

Work was fine - no drama or crazies today. 

 I leave work and a minute later almost get run over by some glossy purse gangster in his swollen SUV barging down the wrong side of the street so that he could get past the other cars actually waiting for the light to change …  Thankfully I can jump a curb faster than some shiny douche can drive his groin replacement down the wrong side of the road at me and it was no problem to dodge. 

 After that I decided to stop at the McDonalds to grab a cheeseburger and an apple pie - but lo and behold I wasn’t gonna use the bike rack out front because it was occupied by three people stripping what was clearly a freshly stolen bike ; right there at a major 4-way intersection on one of the countries largest urban roadways dude was just cutting away at a cable lock in plain view with his little hacksaw and no fucks given. I went and locked up way around the other side instead - and while I’m doing that a dude walks up and squats down in this little grassy island right in front of me and starts taking a fresh steaming dump in a bush about 9” tall …. super discreet bro. 

 I got my food to go because there were a lot of bare feet in the McDonalds that didn’t look at all like feet to me , then decided to ride down to the park blocks away to avoid the smell of stale human urine and fresh human feces that kinda was what McDonalds was all about at that moment. Four blocks away I stopped at a nice big open park and rolled up to an empty picnic table. As soon as I sit down at the bench I was greeted by the faint smell of stale urine yet again - with the added bonus of random psychotic screaming from the crazy chick in the bushes about 20 meters away-  just losing her shit swearing at full volume at nobody. I ate fast and didn’t linger. 

 I made it home without seeing anyone else having the worst moment of their life or having to see or inhale anyone else’s bodily excretions . 

And that was my Friday October 11 2024 in Winnipeg.

If we both finish shift at the same time, I usually walk her to her bus stop and wait with her till her bus comes. 

We message frequently outside of work too, a lot even and have been doing so for the past 6ish months.

We usually take a day or two or more to reply to messages but because we do that mutually I don't think it means too much to read into

1g1npvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1g1npvn/insufferable_colleagues/,Insufferable colleagues,"I'm so sorry but I need to rant.. I really don't get why ppl behave like this. This isn't even high school. This is kindergarden. Sometimes I think im in some sort of comedic show..
About 50% of my direct colleagues are awesome. And then there is A, B and C. Some background:
A and B are married to each other. C is their best buddy at work. C's been mostly gone for external training for 9 months, but sadly is back full term now. A's former mentor hated me with a passion for being an outspoken woman and didn't like to understand why ""I wasn't a home with kids, cooking and taking care of my husband"" (sadly this is a quote said directly to my face). A's mentor is luckily long gone.. but he heavily rubbed off on them. This ""throuple"" has formed a high schoolish like gang, and I'm about sick being at the receiving end of it.
For years I've picked up work.. taken shifts for call-ins (mainly B and A) put myself out for training, learning new things etc. This has started to pay off. I have  a skill set beyond my years of experience, very good standing with my supervisors and I'm positively regarded by leaders/members of other departments. A/B/C seem to jealous that I sometimes receive preferential treatment and think this is highly unfair and uncalled for. Just to clearify.. A/B/C haven't made any substantial effort of the same kind and worked their contract to the t. That's absolutely fine. You work you get paid. But expecting more than that for minimal effort ist sublime hilarious.
What has happend so far:
1) A and B threatened my boss to quit simultaneously. We need to keep up a 24/7 presence and already have 1-2 vacancies that are though to fill long term. Upon this A was given the promotion I was being groomed for by my supervisor (A/B are unaware of this fact). A/B were stupid enough to let the whole team know how ""smart"" they handled it and how they one upped the boss.
2) A demanded to be put on a special training after learning that I already started said training. Me continuing would have meant having to heavily cooporate with A. A has been absolutley und purposefully unreliable with agreements with me in the past (it's documented). Meaning I would have put in the work and A would have signed their name under it. I explained the situation to my boss, stepped down and let A have it. Even though I was promised this training first and comleted part of it. I even stopped my boss from having a heart to heart with A in order not to put more ful to the fire/unjustified hatred. At least A has to do the work themself. So far they havent put in any substantial work into it..
3) In my earlier years I organized a promotion party and gift (we all undergo this promotion after x years) for B. The gift was a day at the spa (to this date fully paid for by myself) and an invitation to dinner. My other colleagues and I wanted to split the bill fairly after that event. I tried several times to get time slots from everybody, mainly A and B (retrospectively they were already a couple at this point) and C. Scheduled multiple times on dates I had the night shift so the others could go and I already sensed ambigious feelings towards me. Made reservations and had to cancle several times (Covid, B calling in sick yet again and so on). After several attempts I just let it be and swore to myself to never do this again for any colleague. B came back on this to me once, after telling them they should suggest some possible dates I never heard about it again...
4) When A had this promotion, A and B suddenly stopped by my desk (despite already making it a point of not talking to me. Jep its kindergarden!). I was absolutely flabbergasted. They demanded to know why I didn't organize a party and gift for A. Wanted me to do so and told me A liked the same gift (day at the spa). I made some nonsensical comments and luckily that was all of it. But what the heck? Btw. C as their buddy never made move to do any of it..
5) A started to disparage me in a meeting I didnt attend (I picked up a night shift for a sick colleague.) A kept saying I only did this because it was convenient to me (it was thursday to friday meaning I'd get an early start into the weekend) and that they never get offered those ""nice"" shifts.  My boss had to stop it. A supposedly tried to keep on going several times. No mention that I also picked up other shifts for this colleague that didn't come with any ""benefits"". I also didnt wait for anybody to approach me but proactively offered to take on any of their shifts after our colleague broke a flipping bone..
Minor things that just show what kind of ppl they are:
-Esp. A and B leave dirty coffee mugs and half empty bottles at every shared workplace. At one point I cleared a mug left by B that has been sitting in our night shift room for months (!), only having to find out it had left over coffee inside it. Still gagging. A leaves sugary residue on every shared keyboard and mouse. 
-In 5 years I've never seen A or B put on the office dish washer, let alone clear it out just once.
-All three never bring in cake, treats etc. but are always first to serve themselves when somebody else does.
-A/B are massive coffee drinkers. Guess who didn't chip in for repairs for our coffee machine, even after being directly (and very kindly) asked to do so by another colleague. Guess who donates bare minimum for any birthday gifts  etc.. 
-I've also been made aware that C badmouths me behind my back and has tried several times to start rumors about me.
For the most part I just ignore this kind of behavior or have a really good laugh about it. A complained to my supervisor once that I'm supposedly bullying them. My supervisor and I had a good chuckle when I asked them if A's really so sure about who's victim and who's perpetrator. For those wondering why I don't quit: I came to a very benefical agreement with my boss. A/B/C don't know about it yet or at least not fully. And maybe they never will. =) I know for a fact it's not me who'll be shown the door as soon as my boss has found any replacement .. But yeah sometimes I do need to vent..

Detective Marcus Tate sat in his car, parked just outside the business park, the dull gray afternoon mirroring his mood. He sipped his lukewarm coffee, his eyes focused on the gleaming new buildings across the street. The compound had popped up fast, almost too fast for what it claimed to be—a consulting firm focused on artificial intelligence solutions. The pace of expansion was suspicious, and Marcus had a gut feeling, the kind of instinct he’d honed over fifteen years of breaking down crime syndicates, that something much darker lurked beneath the surface.

He glanced at the photos pinned to the board in the passenger seat—images of Lucas Cole, Gabriella Devereaux, Natasha Greene, and a few others. On paper, they were tech-savvy entrepreneurs with a promising future. But there were cracks in the facade. The rapid pace of the company’s growth didn’t add up with the relatively small contracts they were pulling in. And then there were the whispers. Anonymous tips, rumors of suspicious activity, faint trails that led back to the very buildings he was watching.

Marcus had once known Lucas, years back when they were on opposite sides of the same world. Marcus had grown up surrounded by drugs, crime, and hopelessness, while Lucas had been the ambitious kid who seemed destined for greatness, someone Marcus respected for his hustle. But their paths had diverged. Marcus had become a detective, working relentlessly to dismantle the kind of organizations that had destroyed his community, while Lucas, it seemed, had taken the opposite route—playing both sides, walking a dangerous line.

He had kept his distance from Lucas for years, but the coincidence was too great to ignore. Now, all Marcus saw was another empire on the rise—one built on the backs of innocent lives and illicit money. His job was to take it down before it grew too powerful.

""Marcus, you copy?""

His radio crackled to life, pulling him from his thoughts.

""Yeah, I’m here. What do you have?"" Marcus said, his voice gruff.

""We’ve been monitoring the compound like you asked. Nothing overtly suspicious yet, but I did catch sight of a few workers moving crates through the back of the unfinished buildings. I’m guessing they’re not delivering furniture.""

Marcus’s pulse quickened. “Good. Keep your distance for now. I want more information before we make any moves. And watch their patterns. They’re smart—Lucas isn’t the type to slip easily.”

He clicked off the radio and leaned back in his seat, his mind churning through the possibilities. Something was definitely off, and it was only a matter of time before they made a mistake. They always did.

Inside the compound, Lucas was restless. The sense of surveillance had become palpable over the last week, and it gnawed at his nerves. He knew Marcus was out there, watching. They hadn’t spoken in years, but Lucas hadn’t forgotten their past. Marcus was good at his job—too good—and Lucas knew that when Marcus started to circle, it was only a matter of time before he bit down.

Lucas walked through the hallway of the main office, feeling the oppressive weight of the growing tension. He passed by Gabriella’s office, where she was pacing in front of her desk, her phone pressed to her ear, no doubt trying to smooth over yet another delay with one of their AI clients. Natasha was in the next room, buried under a mountain of data as she crunched numbers, trying to balance the delicate scales of their legitimate business and the underground empire.

When Lucas entered the control room—a high-tech nerve center where they managed both the consulting side and the illicit operations—he found Rob and David standing over a map of the compound. The map was marked with supply routes, tunnel access points, and the schedule for drug shipments. Charlie Ward, the young tech genius who had designed much of their AI systems, stood nearby, his face pale and tense. He wasn’t cut out for this level of risk, but Lucas needed his skills. They all did.

“Any sign of the heat?” Rob asked as Lucas approached, his arms crossed over his chest. He was wound tight, the kind of tension that only grew more dangerous the longer it was left unchecked.

“Not yet,” Lucas replied, though he couldn’t shake the feeling that Marcus was closing in. “But we have to assume they’re watching. Everyone needs to be careful. No missteps.”

David glanced at Rob, his military-trained gaze scanning the map. “We need to tighten security on the back end. I’ve noticed some of the newer guys slacking off. We’re running too much product through here to afford mistakes.”

Rob leaned over the map, tapping one of the tunnel entry points. “We should start moving more of the shipments offsite. The basements are too hot. If the cops do come sniffing, that’ll be the first place they look.”

Lucas nodded, his mind racing. Rob was right. The basements, while hidden, weren’t impenetrable. They had to be smarter. Every decision now had life-or-death stakes.

“I’ll handle that,” Lucas said. “But Rob—no aggressive moves. We keep things low-key, strictly under the radar.”

Rob scoffed, his temper flaring. “Under the radar? We’re sitting ducks, Lucas! If they find out what we’re doing, it’s not just some fines and bad PR. We’ll go down for this—hard. We should be moving product out of here faster. Build up the muscle, get more guys on our side.”

David shot him a hard look. “We don’t need muscle. We need strategy. The moment we start acting like a cartel, that’s the moment they take us down. Lucas is right. We stay calm. We blend in.”

The room grew quiet as the tension between Rob and David hung in the air. Rob looked like he wanted to argue further, but he bit his tongue. For now, at least.

“Fine,” Rob muttered, though Lucas could see the frustration in his eyes. Rob was pushing for more control, more power, but it was Lucas who held the reins—for now.

Lucas turned to Charlie, who had been nervously fidgeting with his tablet the entire time. “Charlie, I need you to set up a new protocol. I want AI tracking any unusual movement within a two-mile radius of the compound. That includes law enforcement, delivery trucks, anything that seems out of place. If something looks off, I want to know about it.”

Charlie nodded quickly, already tapping commands into his device. “I’ll have it running within the hour.”

“Good,” Lucas said, his voice quieter now. “And make sure everything looks clean. We can’t afford any traces leading back to us.”

As Charlie hurried out of the room, Lucas stood over the map, staring down at the carefully marked routes and connections. It was all so fragile—one wrong move, one crack in the plan, and everything would come crashing down. He had worked too hard to let that happen now.

Later that night, Marcus sat at his desk back at the precinct, reviewing files and piecing together the scattered clues he had collected. His phone buzzed, and he glanced down to see a text message from an unknown number.

**They’re moving something tomorrow night. Check the east side of the compound. Don’t ask who I am.**

Marcus’s pulse quickened. It was the break he had been waiting for. If the tip was legit, it could lead him directly to the heart of whatever Lucas and his crew were hiding. He knew better than to trust anonymous tips without question, but his instincts told him to follow this lead.

He closed the file in front of him and stared at the photo of Lucas clipped to the top. The kid he’d once known had transformed into something unrecognizable. Greed, ambition, or desperation—whatever had pushed Lucas down this path, Marcus didn’t care anymore. He was going to take him down.

The detective tapped his fingers on the edge of the desk, his mind already racing through the next steps. Tomorrow night, the game would change.

As Marcus prepared for the raid, Lucas stood alone at the edge of the compound, staring out into the night. The city lights flickered in the distance, but the weight of the decisions he had made pressed down on him, heavier than ever. The shadows of his empire stretched long, and for the first time, he wondered if the price of power was too high.",1,1728691064.0,u_Necessary_Petals,0,1.0,False
1g1no34,https://www.reddit.com/r/satisfactory/comments/1g1no34/psa_dont_use_train_stations_in_the_blueprint/,PSA: Don't use Train Stations in the Blueprint Designer. Your save might be lost.,"Has anyone else experienced this? Here's what happened to us. Our save of 100 hours each might be lost. My friend is the host of the savegame, and I join him.

Blueprint Creator Mk2 can fit trains stations. Made a design with buildings around it. Saved it. It was buggy, but the blueprint designer is always buggy so I thought nothing of it. Saved the design, cleared the blueprint designer. It was getting really buggy. I think my game grinded to a halt, getting 0.1 FPS, so I alt-f4'd so my friend could not just be stuck there waiting.

Restarted. Came back in. He's back to normal FPS. Tried loading the blueprint again.

Put me and the Host down to 0.1 FPS again. It won’t let me cancel previewing the blueprint since things are moving so slowly. Off in the distance, I see machines hologrammed in yellow. I alt-f4 again. He's back to normal again.

I think the issue was the train station in the blueprint. It wasn't hooked up to anything except some powerlines in the blueprint. No powerlines or tracks were connected to the outside of the designer, not that it would let you. So, I ask him to open the blueprint designer and remove the train station from the problematic blueprint, because that surely was the problem, right? None of my designs without them were an issue. Only when one included a train station did any of this happen.

He clicks to load up the blueprint in the blueprint designer. His game grinds down to 0.5 FPS, and on his stream we can see the yellow effect of items getting built incredibly slowly in the designer. I tell him to try to remove the train station and surely all will be fine. He manages to remove it, and FPS mostly starts to come back. We don't know if it was because he removed the station or if it just finished building it.

What we saw next was shocking.

Off in the distance, we can see the skeleton of a 10 story tall factory. I realize, its the factory we had next to the blueprint designer when I was using it. That means that on the other side, sure enough, there was our other10 story tall factory. That means the yellow buildings I saw were literally part of the blueprint. It grabbed was seems like a hundred meter distance all around everything connected by track, station, conveyor, splitter, constructor.

It only copied logistics, items like conveyors, splitters, constructors, train stations. Powerlines are destructible, but they are invisible.

It did not build/link any walls, foundations, or power poles/outlets.

Some train tracks and signals got built. Others did not.

And again, trying to remove any of these by hand can crash the game. Conveyors, splitters, and train docks seem to crash every time you deconstruct one. Others can be temperamental, but he is deleting what he can one by one and saving in between. As he removes what he can, we can confirm that the buildings no longer count in the items included in the blueprint designer Mk2.

I have not been able to join his session. I get stuck loading in, even though he sees me join the session.

It seems like lowering the graphics to potato quality helped him minorly reduce the chance of crashing when deconstructing the temperamental items above.

What about placing new buildings, or deleting those not involved? He can place/remove new buildings normally, but trying to remove the buildings linked to the Blueprint Designer is likely to result in a crash in the worse game of minesweeper you've ever played.

I hope Coffee Stain enjoys the 2,000 crash reports they're currently getting from us!

Any insight is appreciated. My thinking is that either the train station or a close proximity to nearby railroad track (which was slightly touching the base of the BD Mk2, NOT touching the box the design goes in) caused it to also include everything attached to those nearby tracks. Now everything that got built is connected to the BD Mk2, which won't let us deconstruct it until everything in its blueprint is gone.

Photo is of the 10 story tall factory that got built, relative to the BD Mk2 that no longer has the Station inside. Many buildings are entirely in the ground, so he can't reach them. All we can hope to do is remove as many buildings as he alone can, and maybe get the button to ""Clear Blueprint"" to remove fewer than what crashes his game.

UPDATE: I can join his session again. However, now even though his world is normal, just also with the added glitched buildings, my game has his world missing more and more buildings the further they are from when I loaded in. It seems that it copied EVERYTHING. A factory several km away even got copied, the copper colored factory in the photos. Did it copy literally everything attached to our train system and conveyors!

Here is my story. 30+ male here. Back in January I had a std called m gen. I cleared the infection but had lots of anxiety and depression bc the doctors couldn’t figure out what I had at the time. 

While on the medication I started to have urinary issues. Now I cannot feel when my bladder is full and when I urinate it feels numb I don’t feel urine leaving penis. 
I am not sure if this was caused by stress, infection, or the strong medications.  

I have been to several doctors/urologist but have not got any real answers or help. 

Within the last week I was having urinary frequency issues and trouble getting erection. This came shortly after sex with my wife and the next day had several iced coffee. 
I went to urgent care and they said I had some blood in urine and might be a uti. Waiting on culture but was prescribed some medication. 

My questions. I have a doctor appointment with a new urologist Nov 7th. I read in the past it could be related to pelvic floor. Any idea what tests I should take or what I can do to see improvements?",1,1728690944.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The tasting room. 

Edward Stillwell glanced at the envelope resting on his polished mahogany desk. The glint of gold lettering caught the light, pulling his attention away from the stack of reviews waiting for his keen eye. With a flick of his fingers, he opened the invitation, and the paper crinkled under his grip. He furrowed his brow as he read the elegant script:

You are cordially invited to experience an evening of culinary wonder at La Chambre du Goût. Nothing but the rarest of rare meats awaits you. 


He dropped the invitation onto the desk, his lips curling into a skeptical smile. “Rare meats,” he muttered, shaking his head. The phrase echoed mockingly in his mind, stirring a sense of curiosity mixed with disdain. 


Edward Stillwell cut a striking figure, tall and lean, with a meticulously tailored charcoal suit that hugged his angular frame. His sleek gray hair, neatly combed back, framed a face marked by sharp cheekbones and a well-defined jawline. He often wore a look of intense concentration, his piercing blue eyes scanning his surroundings with the precision of a hawk. But it was his peculiar mannerism that set him apart: when deep in thought, he had a habit of tapping his fingers rhythmically against his chin, as if conducting an invisible orchestra of ideas, his brow slightly furrowed.  


He leaned back in his leather chair, fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. What could possibly remain uncharted in the culinary world? He pictured the countless meats he had tasted, from the gamey flesh of venison to the exotic richness of alligator.


His phone rang, pulling him from his thoughts. “Gerald,” he answered, adjusting his tie and straightening his posture.

“Edward, did you get the invitation?” Gerald’s voice crackled over the line. “You simply must attend. They say Marius Bellefeuille is a culinary genius!”

Edward scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Or a charlatan with a flair for the dramatic. I’ve tasted everything under the sun; what can this chef possibly offer?”

“Exactly that! Something you’ve never tasted before. Don’t be a bore, Edward. You can’t resist an adventure.”

Edward sighed, feeling the familiar tug of his competitive spirit. “Very well, I’ll go. But if it’s just another gimmick…” He left the sentence hanging, letting the threat linger.

After hanging up, he stared at the invitation once more, feeling the pull of intrigue deepening. He found himself contemplating the restaurant’s location, tucked away in an unmarked building down a narrow alley. How odd, he thought. He found a thrill in secrecy, something he couldn’t ignore.

As twilight draped the city, Edward navigated through the winding streets. The cobblestones, worn smooth by countless footsteps, echoed with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingling with the hum of distant conversations. Soft lamplight flickered against wrought-iron balconies adorned with trailing vines, casting playful shadows on the sidewalk. The air carried a medley of scents—freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby boulangerie, mingling with the rich aroma of brewing coffee and the faint, sweet fragrance of blooming jasmine from window boxes. Occasional bursts of laughter erupted from outdoor cafés, punctuated by the soft clinking of glasses. 

As Edward approached the restaurant, La Chambre du Goût, the façade loomed before him, dark and foreboding, its windows obscured by thick, velvet drapes.  A narrow alley framed the entrance, lined with flickering gas lamps that struggled to illuminate the gloom. 

Edward stood before the heavy doors of La Chambre du Goût, the weight of his anticipation pressing against his chest. He pushed them open, and the creak of aged wood echoed in the silence. 

The air inside felt thick, heavy with the aroma of simmering spices. Dimly lit chandeliers hung from the ceiling, their golden hues casting long shadows that danced across the polished wooden floor. A few elegantly set tables dotted the room, each adorned with crisp white linens and flickering candles that barely illuminated the stark surroundings.

As Edward stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted. 

“Welcome to La Chambre du Goût, Mr. Stillwell,” a piercing nasal voice said from behind him, 

Edward turned to find a tall man in a white chef’s coat, a wiry silhouette with dark eyes that sparkled with an unsettling intensity.

“I am Marius Bellefeuille.”  he said, shaking Edward’s hand. Edward recoiled at how greasy and cold his palm was. “We are honored to finally have such a renowned food critic like you here, Edward.” He straightened and gave a big smile. His teeth were yellow. “Tonight, you shall embark on a culinary journey like no other.”

Edward offered a tight smile, but the warmth didn’t reach his eyes. He forced himself to meet Marius’s gaze, feeling a flicker of unease. “Let’s hope your menu lives up to the hype.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and resonant. “Oh, I assure you, it will be a night to remember.”

As Marius gestured toward a table in the corner, Edward followed, scanning the room. The absence of other diners nagged at him. The restaurant felt like a stage set for an unplayed performance, and he was the lone actor, under the scrutiny of an unseen audience.

“Tonight’s menu features some of the rarest meats you’ll ever encounter,” Marius continued, his voice laced with a hint of pride. “Each dish is crafted to evoke a journey through flavor and sensation.”


“This place has quite the reputation.” Edward said as Marius pulled out the chair for him, his eyes lingering a moment too long as Edward sat down. 

The moment he settled into the chair, the flicker of candlelight danced across the table, casting fleeting shadows on his face.

 
“Reputation is merely a reflection of the experience one provides, wouldn’t you agree?”  Marius leaned in, tilted his head, and peered into Edward’s eyes. His fingers danced on the table, tracing invisible patterns, “Tonight, I promise you a taste of the extraordinary.”

Edward nodded, glancing around the dining room. The quiet buzz of the city outside faded away, leaving only the low murmur of Marius’s voice and the occasional clink of silverware. He wasn’t sure where it came from since he was the only one there. 


Edward picked up the wine list, his brow furrowing as he scanned the selections. “You seem confident,” he remarked, trying to sound intrigued. 

Marius leaned back slightly, crossing his arms, an enigmatic smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Confidence is key in my profession. But it’s the ingredients that truly matter.”

As Marius began to pour the first glass of deep red wine, Edward’s senses sharpened. He caught a glimpse of movement from the kitchen, shadows flitting behind the frosted glass door, but the moment passed too quickly for him to focus on any details.

“Let’s begin,” Marius said, placing the glass in front of Edward. “I recommend savoring each course. The flavors will unfold in ways you never imagined.”

Edward raised his glass, the rich aroma wafting up to greet him. But as he took the first sip, Marius watched him intently. 

“Tell me, Mr. Stillwell,” Marius leaned closer, lowering his voice, “what does it take for you to be truly impressed?”

Edward set the glass down, feeling the weight of Marius’s gaze. “I’ll know it when I taste it,” 

“Ah,” Marius murmured, his smile widening, “then let the journey begin.”


The flickering candlelight danced across the elegant dining table, illuminating the polished silverware and crystal glassware that glimmered like jewels. Edward sat poised, anticipation buzzing in the air as Marius placed the first course before him—a carpaccio, glistening under the soft glow.

Marius stepped back, a knowing smile curling his lips as he watched Edward. The thinly sliced meat lay artfully arranged, a deep crimson hue adorned with sprigs of fresh herbs and drizzles of olive oil. Edward leaned forward, the aroma enveloping him, rich and intoxicating, yet something unfamiliar lurked beneath.

With a steady hand, he picked up his fork and pierced the delicate slice. He brought it to his mouth, the coolness of the meat meeting his tongue. The flavors burst forth—earthy, sweet, and somehow alive. His eyes widened, and he chewed slowly, trying to pinpoint the taste that danced on the edge of recognition.

“This is unlike anything I’ve tasted,” Edward finally exclaimed, setting his fork down with a soft clink. He glanced up at Marius, searching for answers. “What exactly is this meat?”

Marius leaned in, tilting his head slightly, his fingers danced on the edge of the table as he savored Edward’s intrigue. “Ah, the first of many surprises,” he replied, his voice smooth and enticing. “It is from an animal that most have only heard of in whispers.”

Edward frowned, a flicker of unease tightening his chest. “Whispers? What do you mean? Is this some rare breed?”

Marius chuckled, his gaze unwavering, and the candlelight cast shadows across his face, deepening the contours. “In a manner of speaking. You might say this animal is as elusive as it is exquisite.”

“I’m not sure I follow. What’s the name of this creature?”

Marius straightened, a satisfied gleam in his eye. “Names can be deceiving. It’s best to let the flavors speak for themselves.”

Edward leaned back and took another bite. The taste lingered, hauntingly complex, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being drawn deeper into something unsettling.


Marius cleared the first course, replacing it with a steaming dish. The rich scent of herbs and spices wafted up, swirling through the air as Edward’s fork sank into the next creation. He raised a tender morsel to his mouth, but the flavors sparked a flicker of discomfort.

“Interesting,” Edward said, forcing the words out as he chewed. He met Marius’s gaze. “You’ve piqued my curiosity. Where do these ‘rare’ animals come from?”

Marius leaned back, fingers gliding along the table’s edge, his calm demeanor never wavering. “All in good time, my friend. Enjoy the journey before you ruin the surprise!”

Edward clenched his jaw, irritation bubbling beneath his composure. “I’m serious. I want to know what I’m eating.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and almost melodic. “Trust the experience. It will all unfold.”

As Edward pressed for answers, a piercing scream erupted from the kitchen. The sound sliced through the air, jolting him in his seat. He glanced toward the frosted glass door, heart racing, but Marius remained unfazed.

“What was that?” Edward demanded, his voice rising. “What is happening back there?”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his smile unwavering. “Just a little kitchen drama. Nothing to concern yourself with. Focus on your meal.”

Edward’s pulse quickened, and he leaned closer, challenging Marius’s calm. “This isn’t a joke. I need to know where this meat comes from.”

Marius tilted his head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Fear not, Edward. You will learn all in due time. The flavors will guide you.”

Another shout pierced the air, more desperate this time. Edward’s stomach churned, and he dropped his fork. “What is going on? Tell me!”

Marius chuckled softly, amusement dancing in his eyes. “It’s all part of the experience. Relax and savor the moment.”

Edward recoiled, dread creeping in as he fought the urge to bolt. The tension in the room thickened, pressing against him like a weight, while Marius’s gaze remained steady, revealing nothing.



Marius whisked away the empty plate and returned with a bowl, steam rising in swirling tendrils. He placed it before Edward, the aroma wafting upward, almost intoxicating. Edward grasped his spoon, but his fingers trembled, a chill creeping through him as he stared at the dark stew, chunks of meat submerged within.

He scooped a bite, lifting it to his lips. The stew’s initial warmth spread across his tongue, rich and velvety, but there was something unsettling about its sweetness. It wasn’t the familiar, comforting sweetness of caramelized onions or roasted root vegetables—it clung to his palate like syrup, coating his mouth in an almost sticky way. Beneath that, a metallic aftertaste lingered, sharp and raw, as if the meat had bled into the broth.

Each bite felt heavier, as though the stew was forcing itself down, refusing to settle. The meat, though tender, had a texture that didn’t quite match anything Edward had encountered before—too smooth, too pliable.. The unsettling sweetness mingled with an earthy undertone that made his stomach churn.

The discomfort came from the way the flavors conflicted—sweetness battling with something darker, something that tasted too close to life, to blood. It wasn’t the familiar gamey flavor of venison or the rich, fatty taste of beef. It was something he couldn’t place, and it gnawed at him. 

“This stew—there’s a sweetness to it. It’s unsettling,” he stammered, setting the spoon down with a deliberate motion. “Are you sure this is safe to eat?”

Marius leaned closer, his breath brushing against Edward’s ear. “ Ah, but isn’t the thrill of culinary exploration worth the risk?”

Edward recoiled instinctively, a shiver darting down his spine. He straightened, trying to assert himself, yet the flickering candlelight made him feel exposed. “I appreciate adventure, but I need to know what I’m eating,” 

Marius straightened, fingers drumming lightly on the table. “You see, Edward, I’ve always had a passion for exotic meats. Each one carries a unique history, a story waiting to unfold on the plate. The flavors, the textures—they resonate with the soul of their origin.”

Edward’s grip on the spoon tightened, knuckles whitening as he forced himself to take another bite. He chewed slowly, his jaw tense, unease twisting in his stomach. “This meat—where does it come from?”

Marius’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, yet Edward felt his heart race with unease. “Imagine traveling to remote locations, seeking out creatures that most only dream of tasting. I live for that journey, for the chance to transform something rare into a culinary masterpiece.”

Edward’s breath quickened, and he leaned back slightly, the chair creaking under him. “But what are these creatures? What am I actually eating?” His voice rose, betraying the tension coursing through him.

Marius chuckled softly, the sound both inviting and menacing. “Every great dish hides its secrets. You must understand the art of it. Some flavors are simply more thrilling than others, more… daring.”

Another echoing shout from the kitchen punctuated Marius’s words, causing Edward to flinch and jump in his seat, his pulse racing. 

“ What’s happening in there ? “ he shouted as he pushed back his chair abruptly, legs scraping against the floor as he rose. His heart pounded as he turned toward the kitchen, the scream still ringing in his ears. “That scream… I can’t just sit here. What’s really going on back there?”

He took a step, but Marius moved swiftly, blocking his path with a hand on Edward’s shoulder. The pressure of his grip was firm, almost too firm.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, my friend,” Marius said softly, his breath warm, tinged with the unsettling scent of iron and spice. His eyes locked onto Edward’s, a thin smile forming on his lips. “The kitchen is no place for a guest. Let them handle their… passions.”

Marius’s hand slid from Edward’s shoulder to the small of his back, guiding him with smooth, deliberate pressure. “Come now,” he murmured, his voice low and calm, “there’s no need for alarm. Let’s not interrupt the artistry behind your meal.”

Edward hesitated, eyes darting to the kitchen door, but Marius steered him gently yet insistently back toward the table. The flickering candlelight cast their shadows long and warped across the room, and Edward felt a cold sweat prickling his neck as his legs moved without his full consent. Marius’s grip remained steady, unyielding, his presence looming beside him.

“Sit, Edward,” Marius urged, almost a command now, as he eased Edward back into his chair. “You wouldn’t want to spoil the experience.” The weight of the chair creaked beneath Edward as Marius released him, stepping back with that same thin smile. “Trust me—everything is as it should be.”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his calm demeanor unshaken. “Just the passion of my chefs. They strive for perfection. Cooking is not just a job; it’s an obsession, an art form. I have dedicated my life to mastering it.”

Edward swallowed hard, feeling the tightness in his throat. He tasted the stew again, the sweetness now cloying, suffocating. 

“My dear Edward, you cannot let fear cloud your senses. Each meal is a journey, and with that journey comes risk. Embrace it, or you will miss the true essence of my cooking.”

Edward set down the spoon, his fingers trembling. He stared at Marius, searching for a glimmer of truth behind the chef’s polished facade.





The final course lay before Edward, a perfectly seared cut of meat resting in a pool of dark sauce. The room had grown unnervingly quiet, the candles flickering in steady rhythm, casting long, distorted shadows across the table. Edward’s hand trembled as he brought the last bite to his lips, his stomach. Each swallow felt more like a stone sinking deeper inside him.

He set the fork down slowly, his breath shallow. Across from him, Marius watched, his hands clasped in front of him, fingers barely twitching, eyes sharp and unwavering.

Edward’s chest tightened, the weight of the evening pressing against him. His mind raced, piecing together fragments—the screams, the evasions, the strange, unplaceable taste of the meat. He couldn’t shake the gnawing thought that he had been deceived, played like a fool.

“Enough games!” His voice cracked with rising panic.“Tell me where this meat comes from, or I will walk out of here!”  His hands were pressing against the edge of the table. 

Marius didn’t flinch. He remained seated, his posture relaxed, fingers still intertwined on the table. A smile played at the edges of his lips as he looked up at Edward, his eyes cold but untroubled.

“You walked in willingly, Edward,” Marius said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “The truth is not so easily digested.”

Edward’s fists clenched, his pulse hammering in his ears. “What are you talking about? What have you been feeding me?”

Marius slowly rose to his feet, his movements smooth, controlled. “You asked for an experience unlike any other. I delivered. Now, whether you can stomach the truth, that’s another matter entirely.”

Edward’s heart raced as Marius stepped closer, his presence suddenly overwhelming, the room shrinking with every word.


The air in the room thickened, the flickering candlelight dimming as if the shadows themselves pressed closer. Marius stood tall, his calm demeanor slipping into something colder, more deliberate. He moved to the side of the table, hands folded behind his back, and looked down at Edward with a gaze that cut deeper than any knife.

“You see, my dear critic,” Marius began, his voice smooth as silk, “you are not just a guest here. You are part of the experience.”

Edward stared at him, his breath shallow, the weight of Marius’s words sinking in. The room felt smaller, the walls pressing in with every second. His chair creaked as he shifted, muscles tensing, ready to spring to his feet.

Marius moved closer, slowly, deliberately, his voice laced with menace. “Stay, and you may yet find enjoyment. Leave…” He paused, the smile that curled his lips devoid of warmth. “Well, let’s not dwell on that.”

Edward shot up from his seat, his voice cracking with disbelief and rising panic. “This is madness! You think you can intimidate me with your theatrics?”

Marius remained unfazed, his eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. He gestured toward the door with a slow sweep of his hand. “You can leave anytime you wish. But I wonder… do you truly want to? You’ve savored what others could only dream of. Do you really want to walk away now, before the final course?”

Edward’s chest tightened, fear creeping through him, yet anger flared, keeping him upright. “You’re insane,”

Marius smiled again, that chilling, knowing smile. “Perhaps. But in this room, at this moment, only one of us holds the key to what happens next. So, my dear Edward…” He leaned in closer, the flicker of candlelight dancing across his face, casting shadows that deepened his grin. “What will it be? Dessert… or something far less pleasant?”


Edward’s pulse hammered in his ears as the horror of Marius’s words sank in. His eyes darted to the door, the faint glow of the hallway taunting him with the slim chance of escape. Without another word, he bolted toward it, his shoes scuffing the floor, breath shallow, hands trembling as he reached for the handle. But Marius was faster—suddenly in front of him, blocking his path, his movements fluid, almost predatory.

“You can’t do this to me!” Edward gasped, his voice thin with panic. “I won’t be a part of this!”

Marius smirked, his hands at his sides, calm, almost amused. “But you already have,” he said, his voice like a smooth, icy whisper. He leaned in slightly, his eyes locking onto Edward’s. “A critic is only as good as his taste, after all. You will be my finest dish.”

Edward stumbled back, his heart racing as the words echoed in his mind. He glanced around frantically, looking for another way out, but the walls seemed to close in on him, the flickering candlelight distorting everything. He turned back to Marius, but the chef stood still, his smirk deepening.

Edward felt the room tilt. “No—this isn’t real,” he muttered, backing up against the wall. “This can’t be happening…”

But Marius only stepped forward. “It’s already begun.”






Edward woke up in a small dimly lit room. The floor was cold against his body. His breath came in shallow gasps, his eyes darting around the space. A single flickering light bulb hung from the ceiling, casting erratic shadows across the bare walls. His heart thundered in his chest, each beat a reminder of the trap he’d walked into. He stumbled to the door, pushing against it, but it wouldn’t budge. He was locked in.

“This can’t be happening,” Edward whispered, sliding down to the floor. His hands gripped his hair, pulling at it. “I— I’m a food critic, not a meal!”

From behind the door, Marius’s voice carried through. “Remember, Edward, every dish tells a story. Yours is just about to be served.”

Edward’s breath hitched. He could feel the walls closing in, the weight of his arrogance suffocating him. How many times had he walked into restaurants with a sense of superiority, dissecting dishes, belittling chefs who poured their souls into their work? Now, here he was—reduced to nothing more than an ingredient in Marius’s twisted masterpiece.

He pressed his back against the door, trembling, the irony suffocating him. He had always prided himself on knowing the finest meals, tasting the rarest flavors. But this… this was the rarest flavor of all, and he was part of it.



The next day, the dining room was bathed in warm, inviting light as the next wave of diners filed in, their conversations light and buzzing with anticipation. The tables gleamed under the soft glow of the chandeliers, the flicker of candles reflecting off the pristine silverware. Each guest looked around with curiosity, marveling at the exclusivity of the experience.

Marius stood at the center of the room, hands outstretched, his smile wide and welcoming. His eyes glittered as he surveyed the new faces, a fresh crop of eager participants ready to be swept into his web.

“Welcome, everyone!” he announced, his voice full of charm and promise. “Tonight, we delve into the extraordinary. Who among you is ready for the rarest flavors life has to offer?”

The diners chuckled, exchanging excited glances, unaware of the horror that had transpired just hours before. Plates clinked, glasses were raised, and Marius’s smile never faltered. As he moved toward the kitchen, he cast one final glance at the dining room, satisfied.

The cycle had begun again.

“This place has quite the reputation.” Edward said as Marius pulled out the chair for him, his eyes lingering a moment too long as Edward sat down. 

The moment he settled into the chair, the flicker of candlelight danced across the table, casting fleeting shadows on his face.

 
“Reputation is merely a reflection of the experience one provides, wouldn’t you agree?”  Marius leaned in, tilted his head, and peered into Edward’s eyes. His fingers danced on the table, tracing invisible patterns, “Tonight, I promise you a taste of the extraordinary.”

Edward nodded, glancing around the dining room. The quiet buzz of the city outside faded away, leaving only the low murmur of Marius’s voice and the occasional clink of silverware. He wasn’t sure where it came from since he was the only one there. 


Edward picked up the wine list, his brow furrowing as he scanned the selections. “You seem confident,” he remarked, trying to sound intrigued. 

Marius leaned back slightly, crossing his arms, an enigmatic smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Confidence is key in my profession. But it’s the ingredients that truly matter.”

As Marius began to pour the first glass of deep red wine, Edward’s senses sharpened. He caught a glimpse of movement from the kitchen, shadows flitting behind the frosted glass door, but the moment passed too quickly for him to focus on any details.

“Let’s begin,” Marius said, placing the glass in front of Edward. “I recommend savoring each course. The flavors will unfold in ways you never imagined.”

Edward raised his glass, the rich aroma wafting up to greet him. But as he took the first sip, Marius watched him intently. 

“Tell me, Mr. Stillwell,” Marius leaned closer, lowering his voice, “what does it take for you to be truly impressed?”

Edward set the glass down, feeling the weight of Marius’s gaze. “I’ll know it when I taste it,” 

“Ah,” Marius murmured, his smile widening, “then let the journey begin.”


The flickering candlelight danced across the elegant dining table, illuminating the polished silverware and crystal glassware that glimmered like jewels. Edward sat poised, anticipation buzzing in the air as Marius placed the first course before him—a carpaccio, glistening under the soft glow.

Marius stepped back, a knowing smile curling his lips as he watched Edward. The thinly sliced meat lay artfully arranged, a deep crimson hue adorned with sprigs of fresh herbs and drizzles of olive oil. Edward leaned forward, the aroma enveloping him, rich and intoxicating, yet something unfamiliar lurked beneath.

With a steady hand, he picked up his fork and pierced the delicate slice. He brought it to his mouth, the coolness of the meat meeting his tongue. The flavors burst forth—earthy, sweet, and somehow alive. His eyes widened, and he chewed slowly, trying to pinpoint the taste that danced on the edge of recognition.

“This is unlike anything I’ve tasted,” Edward finally exclaimed, setting his fork down with a soft clink. He glanced up at Marius, searching for answers. “What exactly is this meat?”

Marius leaned in, tilting his head slightly, his fingers danced on the edge of the table as he savored Edward’s intrigue. “Ah, the first of many surprises,” he replied, his voice smooth and enticing. “It is from an animal that most have only heard of in whispers.”

Edward frowned, a flicker of unease tightening his chest. “Whispers? What do you mean? Is this some rare breed?”

Marius chuckled, his gaze unwavering, and the candlelight cast shadows across his face, deepening the contours. “In a manner of speaking. You might say this animal is as elusive as it is exquisite.”

“I’m not sure I follow. What’s the name of this creature?”

Marius straightened, a satisfied gleam in his eye. “Names can be deceiving. It’s best to let the flavors speak for themselves.”

Edward leaned back and took another bite. The taste lingered, hauntingly complex, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being drawn deeper into something unsettling.


Marius cleared the first course, replacing it with a steaming dish. The rich scent of herbs and spices wafted up, swirling through the air as Edward’s fork sank into the next creation. He raised a tender morsel to his mouth, but the flavors sparked a flicker of discomfort.

“Interesting,” Edward said, forcing the words out as he chewed. He met Marius’s gaze. “You’ve piqued my curiosity. Where do these ‘rare’ animals come from?”

Marius leaned back, fingers gliding along the table’s edge, his calm demeanor never wavering. “All in good time, my friend. Enjoy the journey before you ruin the surprise!”

Edward clenched his jaw, irritation bubbling beneath his composure. “I’m serious. I want to know what I’m eating.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and almost melodic. “Trust the experience. It will all unfold.”

As Edward pressed for answers, a piercing scream erupted from the kitchen. The sound sliced through the air, jolting him in his seat. He glanced toward the frosted glass door, heart racing, but Marius remained unfazed.

“What was that?” Edward demanded, his voice rising. “What is happening back there?”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his smile unwavering. “Just a little kitchen drama. Nothing to concern yourself with. Focus on your meal.”

Edward’s pulse quickened, and he leaned closer, challenging Marius’s calm. “This isn’t a joke. I need to know where this meat comes from.”

Marius tilted his head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Fear not, Edward. You will learn all in due time. The flavors will guide you.”

Another shout pierced the air, more desperate this time. Edward’s stomach churned, and he dropped his fork. “What is going on? Tell me!”

Marius chuckled softly, amusement dancing in his eyes. “It’s all part of the experience. Relax and savor the moment.”

Edward recoiled, dread creeping in as he fought the urge to bolt. The tension in the room thickened, pressing against him like a weight, while Marius’s gaze remained steady, revealing nothing.



Marius whisked away the empty plate and returned with a bowl, steam rising in swirling tendrils. He placed it before Edward, the aroma wafting upward, almost intoxicating. Edward grasped his spoon, but his fingers trembled, a chill creeping through him as he stared at the dark stew, chunks of meat submerged within.

He scooped a bite, lifting it to his lips. The stew’s initial warmth spread across his tongue, rich and velvety, but there was something unsettling about its sweetness. It wasn’t the familiar, comforting sweetness of caramelized onions or roasted root vegetables—it clung to his palate like syrup, coating his mouth in an almost sticky way. Beneath that, a metallic aftertaste lingered, sharp and raw, as if the meat had bled into the broth.

Each bite felt heavier, as though the stew was forcing itself down, refusing to settle. The meat, though tender, had a texture that didn’t quite match anything Edward had encountered before—too smooth, too pliable.. The unsettling sweetness mingled with an earthy undertone that made his stomach churn.

The discomfort came from the way the flavors conflicted—sweetness battling with something darker, something that tasted too close to life, to blood. It wasn’t the familiar gamey flavor of venison or the rich, fatty taste of beef. It was something he couldn’t place, and it gnawed at him. 

“This stew—there’s a sweetness to it. It’s unsettling,” he stammered, setting the spoon down with a deliberate motion. “Are you sure this is safe to eat?”

Marius leaned closer, his breath brushing against Edward’s ear. “ Ah, but isn’t the thrill of culinary exploration worth the risk?”

Edward recoiled instinctively, a shiver darting down his spine. He straightened, trying to assert himself, yet the flickering candlelight made him feel exposed. “I appreciate adventure, but I need to know what I’m eating,” 

Marius straightened, fingers drumming lightly on the table. “You see, Edward, I’ve always had a passion for exotic meats. Each one carries a unique history, a story waiting to unfold on the plate. The flavors, the textures—they resonate with the soul of their origin.”

Edward’s grip on the spoon tightened, knuckles whitening as he forced himself to take another bite. He chewed slowly, his jaw tense, unease twisting in his stomach. “This meat—where does it come from?”

Marius’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, yet Edward felt his heart race with unease. “Imagine traveling to remote locations, seeking out creatures that most only dream of tasting. I live for that journey, for the chance to transform something rare into a culinary masterpiece.”

Edward’s breath quickened, and he leaned back slightly, the chair creaking under him. “But what are these creatures? What am I actually eating?” His voice rose, betraying the tension coursing through him.

Marius chuckled softly, the sound both inviting and menacing. “Every great dish hides its secrets. You must understand the art of it. Some flavors are simply more thrilling than others, more… daring.”

Another echoing shout from the kitchen punctuated Marius’s words, causing Edward to flinch and jump in his seat, his pulse racing. 

“ What’s happening in there ? “ he shouted as he pushed back his chair abruptly, legs scraping against the floor as he rose. His heart pounded as he turned toward the kitchen, the scream still ringing in his ears. “That scream… I can’t just sit here. What’s really going on back there?”

He took a step, but Marius moved swiftly, blocking his path with a hand on Edward’s shoulder. The pressure of his grip was firm, almost too firm.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, my friend,” Marius said softly, his breath warm, tinged with the unsettling scent of iron and spice. His eyes locked onto Edward’s, a thin smile forming on his lips. “The kitchen is no place for a guest. Let them handle their… passions.”

Marius’s hand slid from Edward’s shoulder to the small of his back, guiding him with smooth, deliberate pressure. “Come now,” he murmured, his voice low and calm, “there’s no need for alarm. Let’s not interrupt the artistry behind your meal.”

Edward hesitated, eyes darting to the kitchen door, but Marius steered him gently yet insistently back toward the table. The flickering candlelight cast their shadows long and warped across the room, and Edward felt a cold sweat prickling his neck as his legs moved without his full consent. Marius’s grip remained steady, unyielding, his presence looming beside him.

“Sit, Edward,” Marius urged, almost a command now, as he eased Edward back into his chair. “You wouldn’t want to spoil the experience.” The weight of the chair creaked beneath Edward as Marius released him, stepping back with that same thin smile. “Trust me—everything is as it should be.”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his calm demeanor unshaken. “Just the passion of my chefs. They strive for perfection. Cooking is not just a job; it’s an obsession, an art form. I have dedicated my life to mastering it.”

Edward swallowed hard, feeling the tightness in his throat. He tasted the stew again, the sweetness now cloying, suffocating. 

“My dear Edward, you cannot let fear cloud your senses. Each meal is a journey, and with that journey comes risk. Embrace it, or you will miss the true essence of my cooking.”

Edward set down the spoon, his fingers trembling. He stared at Marius, searching for a glimmer of truth behind the chef’s polished facade.





The final course lay before Edward, a perfectly seared cut of meat resting in a pool of dark sauce. The room had grown unnervingly quiet, the candles flickering in steady rhythm, casting long, distorted shadows across the table. Edward’s hand trembled as he brought the last bite to his lips, his stomach. Each swallow felt more like a stone sinking deeper inside him.

He set the fork down slowly, his breath shallow. Across from him, Marius watched, his hands clasped in front of him, fingers barely twitching, eyes sharp and unwavering.

Edward’s chest tightened, the weight of the evening pressing against him. His mind raced, piecing together fragments—the screams, the evasions, the strange, unplaceable taste of the meat. He couldn’t shake the gnawing thought that he had been deceived, played like a fool.

“Enough games!” His voice cracked with rising panic.“Tell me where this meat comes from, or I will walk out of here!”  His hands were pressing against the edge of the table. 

Marius didn’t flinch. He remained seated, his posture relaxed, fingers still intertwined on the table. A smile played at the edges of his lips as he looked up at Edward, his eyes cold but untroubled.

“You walked in willingly, Edward,” Marius said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “The truth is not so easily digested.”

Edward’s fists clenched, his pulse hammering in his ears. “What are you talking about? What have you been feeding me?”

Marius slowly rose to his feet, his movements smooth, controlled. “You asked for an experience unlike any other. I delivered. Now, whether you can stomach the truth, that’s another matter entirely.”

Edward’s heart raced as Marius stepped closer, his presence suddenly overwhelming, the room shrinking with every word.


The air in the room thickened, the flickering candlelight dimming as if the shadows themselves pressed closer. Marius stood tall, his calm demeanor slipping into something colder, more deliberate. He moved to the side of the table, hands folded behind his back, and looked down at Edward with a gaze that cut deeper than any knife.

“You see, my dear critic,” Marius began, his voice smooth as silk, “you are not just a guest here. You are part of the experience.”

Edward stared at him, his breath shallow, the weight of Marius’s words sinking in. The room felt smaller, the walls pressing in with every second. His chair creaked as he shifted, muscles tensing, ready to spring to his feet.

Marius moved closer, slowly, deliberately, his voice laced with menace. “Stay, and you may yet find enjoyment. Leave…” He paused, the smile that curled his lips devoid of warmth. “Well, let’s not dwell on that.”

Edward shot up from his seat, his voice cracking with disbelief and rising panic. “This is madness! You think you can intimidate me with your theatrics?”

Marius remained unfazed, his eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. He gestured toward the door with a slow sweep of his hand. “You can leave anytime you wish. But I wonder… do you truly want to? You’ve savored what others could only dream of. Do you really want to walk away now, before the final course?”

Edward’s chest tightened, fear creeping through him, yet anger flared, keeping him upright. “You’re insane,”

Marius smiled again, that chilling, knowing smile. “Perhaps. But in this room, at this moment, only one of us holds the key to what happens next. So, my dear Edward…” He leaned in closer, the flicker of candlelight dancing across his face, casting shadows that deepened his grin. “What will it be? Dessert… or something far less pleasant?”


Edward’s pulse hammered in his ears as the horror of Marius’s words sank in. His eyes darted to the door, the faint glow of the hallway taunting him with the slim chance of escape. Without another word, he bolted toward it, his shoes scuffing the floor, breath shallow, hands trembling as he reached for the handle. But Marius was faster—suddenly in front of him, blocking his path, his movements fluid, almost predatory.

“You can’t do this to me!” Edward gasped, his voice thin with panic. “I won’t be a part of this!”

Marius smirked, his hands at his sides, calm, almost amused. “But you already have,” he said, his voice like a smooth, icy whisper. He leaned in slightly, his eyes locking onto Edward’s. “A critic is only as good as his taste, after all. You will be my finest dish.”

Edward stumbled back, his heart racing as the words echoed in his mind. He glanced around frantically, looking for another way out, but the walls seemed to close in on him, the flickering candlelight distorting everything. He turned back to Marius, but the chef stood still, his smirk deepening.

Edward felt the room tilt. “No—this isn’t real,” he muttered, backing up against the wall. “This can’t be happening…”

But Marius only stepped forward. “It’s already begun.”






Edward woke up in a small dimly lit room. The floor was cold against his body. His breath came in shallow gasps, his eyes darting around the space. A single flickering light bulb hung from the ceiling, casting erratic shadows across the bare walls. His heart thundered in his chest, each beat a reminder of the trap he’d walked into. He stumbled to the door, pushing against it, but it wouldn’t budge. He was locked in.

“This can’t be happening,” Edward whispered, sliding down to the floor. His hands gripped his hair, pulling at it. “I— I’m a food critic, not a meal!”

From behind the door, Marius’s voice carried through. “Remember, Edward, every dish tells a story. Yours is just about to be served.”

Edward’s breath hitched. He could feel the walls closing in, the weight of his arrogance suffocating him. How many times had he walked into restaurants with a sense of superiority, dissecting dishes, belittling chefs who poured their souls into their work? Now, here he was—reduced to nothing more than an ingredient in Marius’s twisted masterpiece.

He pressed his back against the door, trembling, the irony suffocating him. He had always prided himself on knowing the finest meals, tasting the rarest flavors. But this… this was the rarest flavor of all, and he was part of it.



The next day, the dining room was bathed in warm, inviting light as the next wave of diners filed in, their conversations light and buzzing with anticipation. The tables gleamed under the soft glow of the chandeliers, the flicker of candles reflecting off the pristine silverware. Each guest looked around with curiosity, marveling at the exclusivity of the experience.

Marius stood at the center of the room, hands outstretched, his smile wide and welcoming. His eyes glittered as he surveyed the new faces, a fresh crop of eager participants ready to be swept into his web.

“Welcome, everyone!” he announced, his voice full of charm and promise. “Tonight, we delve into the extraordinary. Who among you is ready for the rarest flavors life has to offer?”

The diners chuckled, exchanging excited glances, unaware of the horror that had transpired just hours before. Plates clinked, glasses were raised, and Marius’s smile never faltered. As he moved toward the kitchen, he cast one final glance at the dining room, satisfied.

The cycle had begun again.

Edward Stillwell glanced at the envelope resting on his polished mahogany desk. The glint of gold lettering caught the light, pulling his attention away from the stack of reviews waiting for his keen eye. With a flick of his fingers, he opened the invitation, and the paper crinkled under his grip. He furrowed his brow as he read the elegant script:

You are cordially invited to experience an evening of culinary wonder at La Chambre du Goût. Nothing but the rarest of rare meats awaits you. 


He dropped the invitation onto the desk, his lips curling into a skeptical smile. “Rare meats,” he muttered, shaking his head. The phrase echoed mockingly in his mind, stirring a sense of curiosity mixed with disdain. 


Edward Stillwell cut a striking figure, tall and lean, with a meticulously tailored charcoal suit that hugged his angular frame. His sleek gray hair, neatly combed back, framed a face marked by sharp cheekbones and a well-defined jawline. He often wore a look of intense concentration, his piercing blue eyes scanning his surroundings with the precision of a hawk. But it was his peculiar mannerism that set him apart: when deep in thought, he had a habit of tapping his fingers rhythmically against his chin, as if conducting an invisible orchestra of ideas, his brow slightly furrowed.  


He leaned back in his leather chair, fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. What could possibly remain uncharted in the culinary world? He pictured the countless meats he had tasted, from the gamey flesh of venison to the exotic richness of alligator.


His phone rang, pulling him from his thoughts. “Gerald,” he answered, adjusting his tie and straightening his posture.

“Edward, did you get the invitation?” Gerald’s voice crackled over the line. “You simply must attend. They say Marius Bellefeuille is a culinary genius!”

Edward scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Or a charlatan with a flair for the dramatic. I’ve tasted everything under the sun; what can this chef possibly offer?”

“Exactly that! Something you’ve never tasted before. Don’t be a bore, Edward. You can’t resist an adventure.”

Edward sighed, feeling the familiar tug of his competitive spirit. “Very well, I’ll go. But if it’s just another gimmick…” He left the sentence hanging, letting the threat linger.

After hanging up, he stared at the invitation once more, feeling the pull of intrigue deepening. He found himself contemplating the restaurant’s location, tucked away in an unmarked building down a narrow alley. How odd, he thought. He found a thrill in secrecy, something he couldn’t ignore.

As twilight draped the city, Edward navigated through the winding streets. The cobblestones, worn smooth by countless footsteps, echoed with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingling with the hum of distant conversations. Soft lamplight flickered against wrought-iron balconies adorned with trailing vines, casting playful shadows on the sidewalk. The air carried a medley of scents—freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby boulangerie, mingling with the rich aroma of brewing coffee and the faint, sweet fragrance of blooming jasmine from window boxes. Occasional bursts of laughter erupted from outdoor cafés, punctuated by the soft clinking of glasses. 

As Edward approached the restaurant, La Chambre du Goût, the façade loomed before him, dark and foreboding, its windows obscured by thick, velvet drapes.  A narrow alley framed the entrance, lined with flickering gas lamps that struggled to illuminate the gloom. 

Edward stood before the heavy doors of La Chambre du Goût, the weight of his anticipation pressing against his chest. He pushed them open, and the creak of aged wood echoed in the silence. 

The air inside felt thick, heavy with the aroma of simmering spices. Dimly lit chandeliers hung from the ceiling, their golden hues casting long shadows that danced across the polished wooden floor. A few elegantly set tables dotted the room, each adorned with crisp white linens and flickering candles that barely illuminated the stark surroundings.

As Edward stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted. 

“Welcome to La Chambre du Goût, Mr. Stillwell,” a piercing nasal voice said from behind him, 

Edward turned to find a tall man in a white chef’s coat, a wiry silhouette with dark eyes that sparkled with an unsettling intensity.

“I am Marius Bellefeuille.”  he said, shaking Edward’s hand. Edward recoiled at how greasy and cold his palm was. “We are honored to finally have such a renowned food critic like you here, Edward.” He straightened and gave a big smile. His teeth were yellow. “Tonight, you shall embark on a culinary journey like no other.”

Edward offered a tight smile, but the warmth didn’t reach his eyes. He forced himself to meet Marius’s gaze, feeling a flicker of unease. “Let’s hope your menu lives up to the hype.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and resonant. “Oh, I assure you, it will be a night to remember.”

As Marius gestured toward a table in the corner, Edward followed, scanning the room. The absence of other diners nagged at him. The restaurant felt like a stage set for an unplayed performance, and he was the lone actor, under the scrutiny of an unseen audience.

“Tonight’s menu features some of the rarest meats you’ll ever encounter,” Marius continued, his voice laced with a hint of pride. “Each dish is crafted to evoke a journey through flavor and sensation.”

Edward swallowed hard, feeling the tightness in his throat. He tasted the stew again, the sweetness now cloying, suffocating. 

“My dear Edward, you cannot let fear cloud your senses. Each meal is a journey, and with that journey comes risk. Embrace it, or you will miss the true essence of my cooking.”

Edward set down the spoon, his fingers trembling. He stared at Marius, searching for a glimmer of truth behind the chef’s polished facade.





The final course lay before Edward, a perfectly seared cut of meat resting in a pool of dark sauce. The room had grown unnervingly quiet, the candles flickering in steady rhythm, casting long, distorted shadows across the table. Edward’s hand trembled as he brought the last bite to his lips, his stomach. Each swallow felt more like a stone sinking deeper inside him.

He set the fork down slowly, his breath shallow. Across from him, Marius watched, his hands clasped in front of him, fingers barely twitching, eyes sharp and unwavering.

Edward’s chest tightened, the weight of the evening pressing against him. His mind raced, piecing together fragments—the screams, the evasions, the strange, unplaceable taste of the meat. He couldn’t shake the gnawing thought that he had been deceived, played like a fool.

“Enough games!” His voice cracked with rising panic.“Tell me where this meat comes from, or I will walk out of here!”  His hands were pressing against the edge of the table. 

Marius didn’t flinch. He remained seated, his posture relaxed, fingers still intertwined on the table. A smile played at the edges of his lips as he looked up at Edward, his eyes cold but untroubled.

“You walked in willingly, Edward,” Marius said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “The truth is not so easily digested.”

Edward’s fists clenched, his pulse hammering in his ears. “What are you talking about? What have you been feeding me?”

Marius slowly rose to his feet, his movements smooth, controlled. “You asked for an experience unlike any other. I delivered. Now, whether you can stomach the truth, that’s another matter entirely.”

Edward’s heart raced as Marius stepped closer, his presence suddenly overwhelming, the room shrinking with every word.


The air in the room thickened, the flickering candlelight dimming as if the shadows themselves pressed closer. Marius stood tall, his calm demeanor slipping into something colder, more deliberate. He moved to the side of the table, hands folded behind his back, and looked down at Edward with a gaze that cut deeper than any knife.

“You see, my dear critic,” Marius began, his voice smooth as silk, “you are not just a guest here. You are part of the experience.”

Edward stared at him, his breath shallow, the weight of Marius’s words sinking in. The room felt smaller, the walls pressing in with every second. His chair creaked as he shifted, muscles tensing, ready to spring to his feet.

Marius moved closer, slowly, deliberately, his voice laced with menace. “Stay, and you may yet find enjoyment. Leave…” He paused, the smile that curled his lips devoid of warmth. “Well, let’s not dwell on that.”

Edward shot up from his seat, his voice cracking with disbelief and rising panic. “This is madness! You think you can intimidate me with your theatrics?”

Marius remained unfazed, his eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. He gestured toward the door with a slow sweep of his hand. “You can leave anytime you wish. But I wonder… do you truly want to? You’ve savored what others could only dream of. Do you really want to walk away now, before the final course?”

Edward’s chest tightened, fear creeping through him, yet anger flared, keeping him upright. “You’re insane,”

Marius smiled again, that chilling, knowing smile. “Perhaps. But in this room, at this moment, only one of us holds the key to what happens next. So, my dear Edward…” He leaned in closer, the flicker of candlelight dancing across his face, casting shadows that deepened his grin. “What will it be? Dessert… or something far less pleasant?”


Edward’s pulse hammered in his ears as the horror of Marius’s words sank in. His eyes darted to the door, the faint glow of the hallway taunting him with the slim chance of escape. Without another word, he bolted toward it, his shoes scuffing the floor, breath shallow, hands trembling as he reached for the handle. But Marius was faster—suddenly in front of him, blocking his path, his movements fluid, almost predatory.

“You can’t do this to me!” Edward gasped, his voice thin with panic. “I won’t be a part of this!”

Marius smirked, his hands at his sides, calm, almost amused. “But you already have,” he said, his voice like a smooth, icy whisper. He leaned in slightly, his eyes locking onto Edward’s. “A critic is only as good as his taste, after all. You will be my finest dish.”

Edward stumbled back, his heart racing as the words echoed in his mind. He glanced around frantically, looking for another way out, but the walls seemed to close in on him, the flickering candlelight distorting everything. He turned back to Marius, but the chef stood still, his smirk deepening.

Edward felt the room tilt. “No—this isn’t real,” he muttered, backing up against the wall. “This can’t be happening…”

But Marius only stepped forward. “It’s already begun.”






Edward woke up in a small dimly lit room. The floor was cold against his body. His breath came in shallow gasps, his eyes darting around the space. A single flickering light bulb hung from the ceiling, casting erratic shadows across the bare walls. His heart thundered in his chest, each beat a reminder of the trap he’d walked into. He stumbled to the door, pushing against it, but it wouldn’t budge. He was locked in.

“This can’t be happening,” Edward whispered, sliding down to the floor. His hands gripped his hair, pulling at it. “I— I’m a food critic, not a meal!”

From behind the door, Marius’s voice carried through. “Remember, Edward, every dish tells a story. Yours is just about to be served.”

Edward’s breath hitched. He could feel the walls closing in, the weight of his arrogance suffocating him. How many times had he walked into restaurants with a sense of superiority, dissecting dishes, belittling chefs who poured their souls into their work? Now, here he was—reduced to nothing more than an ingredient in Marius’s twisted masterpiece.

He pressed his back against the door, trembling, the irony suffocating him. He had always prided himself on knowing the finest meals, tasting the rarest flavors. But this… this was the rarest flavor of all, and he was part of it.



The next day, the dining room was bathed in warm, inviting light as the next wave of diners filed in, their conversations light and buzzing with anticipation. The tables gleamed under the soft glow of the chandeliers, the flicker of candles reflecting off the pristine silverware. Each guest looked around with curiosity, marveling at the exclusivity of the experience.

Marius stood at the center of the room, hands outstretched, his smile wide and welcoming. His eyes glittered as he surveyed the new faces, a fresh crop of eager participants ready to be swept into his web.

“Welcome, everyone!” he announced, his voice full of charm and promise. “Tonight, we delve into the extraordinary. Who among you is ready for the rarest flavors life has to offer?”

The diners chuckled, exchanging excited glances, unaware of the horror that had transpired just hours before. Plates clinked, glasses were raised, and Marius’s smile never faltered. As he moved toward the kitchen, he cast one final glance at the dining room, satisfied.

The cycle had begun again.

The tasting room. 

Edward Stillwell glanced at the envelope resting on his polished mahogany desk. The glint of gold lettering caught the light, pulling his attention away from the stack of reviews waiting for his keen eye. With a flick of his fingers, he opened the invitation, and the paper crinkled under his grip. He furrowed his brow as he read the elegant script:

You are cordially invited to experience an evening of culinary wonder at La Chambre du Goût. Nothing but the rarest of rare meats awaits you. 


He dropped the invitation onto the desk, his lips curling into a skeptical smile. “Rare meats,” he muttered, shaking his head. The phrase echoed mockingly in his mind, stirring a sense of curiosity mixed with disdain. 


Edward Stillwell cut a striking figure, tall and lean, with a meticulously tailored charcoal suit that hugged his angular frame. His sleek gray hair, neatly combed back, framed a face marked by sharp cheekbones and a well-defined jawline. He often wore a look of intense concentration, his piercing blue eyes scanning his surroundings with the precision of a hawk. But it was his peculiar mannerism that set him apart: when deep in thought, he had a habit of tapping his fingers rhythmically against his chin, as if conducting an invisible orchestra of ideas, his brow slightly furrowed.  


He leaned back in his leather chair, fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. What could possibly remain uncharted in the culinary world? He pictured the countless meats he had tasted, from the gamey flesh of venison to the exotic richness of alligator.


His phone rang, pulling him from his thoughts. “Gerald,” he answered, adjusting his tie and straightening his posture.

“Edward, did you get the invitation?” Gerald’s voice crackled over the line. “You simply must attend. They say Marius Bellefeuille is a culinary genius!”

Edward scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Or a charlatan with a flair for the dramatic. I’ve tasted everything under the sun; what can this chef possibly offer?”

“Exactly that! Something you’ve never tasted before. Don’t be a bore, Edward. You can’t resist an adventure.”

Edward sighed, feeling the familiar tug of his competitive spirit. “Very well, I’ll go. But if it’s just another gimmick…” He left the sentence hanging, letting the threat linger.

After hanging up, he stared at the invitation once more, feeling the pull of intrigue deepening. He found himself contemplating the restaurant’s location, tucked away in an unmarked building down a narrow alley. How odd, he thought. He found a thrill in secrecy, something he couldn’t ignore.

As twilight draped the city, Edward navigated through the winding streets. The cobblestones, worn smooth by countless footsteps, echoed with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingling with the hum of distant conversations. Soft lamplight flickered against wrought-iron balconies adorned with trailing vines, casting playful shadows on the sidewalk. The air carried a medley of scents—freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby boulangerie, mingling with the rich aroma of brewing coffee and the faint, sweet fragrance of blooming jasmine from window boxes. Occasional bursts of laughter erupted from outdoor cafés, punctuated by the soft clinking of glasses. 

As Edward approached the restaurant, La Chambre du Goût, the façade loomed before him, dark and foreboding, its windows obscured by thick, velvet drapes.  A narrow alley framed the entrance, lined with flickering gas lamps that struggled to illuminate the gloom. 

Edward stood before the heavy doors of La Chambre du Goût, the weight of his anticipation pressing against his chest. He pushed them open, and the creak of aged wood echoed in the silence. 

The air inside felt thick, heavy with the aroma of simmering spices. Dimly lit chandeliers hung from the ceiling, their golden hues casting long shadows that danced across the polished wooden floor. A few elegantly set tables dotted the room, each adorned with crisp white linens and flickering candles that barely illuminated the stark surroundings.

As Edward stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted. 

“Welcome to La Chambre du Goût, Mr. Stillwell,” a piercing nasal voice said from behind him, 

Edward turned to find a tall man in a white chef’s coat, a wiry silhouette with dark eyes that sparkled with an unsettling intensity.

“I am Marius Bellefeuille.”  he said, shaking Edward’s hand. Edward recoiled at how greasy and cold his palm was. “We are honored to finally have such a renowned food critic like you here, Edward.” He straightened and gave a big smile. His teeth were yellow. “Tonight, you shall embark on a culinary journey like no other.”

Edward offered a tight smile, but the warmth didn’t reach his eyes. He forced himself to meet Marius’s gaze, feeling a flicker of unease. “Let’s hope your menu lives up to the hype.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and resonant. “Oh, I assure you, it will be a night to remember.”

As Marius gestured toward a table in the corner, Edward followed, scanning the room. The absence of other diners nagged at him. The restaurant felt like a stage set for an unplayed performance, and he was the lone actor, under the scrutiny of an unseen audience.

“Tonight’s menu features some of the rarest meats you’ll ever encounter,” Marius continued, his voice laced with a hint of pride. “Each dish is crafted to evoke a journey through flavor and sensation.”


“This place has quite the reputation.” Edward said as Marius pulled out the chair for him, his eyes lingering a moment too long as Edward sat down. 

The moment he settled into the chair, the flicker of candlelight danced across the table, casting fleeting shadows on his face.

 
“Reputation is merely a reflection of the experience one provides, wouldn’t you agree?”  Marius leaned in, tilted his head, and peered into Edward’s eyes. His fingers danced on the table, tracing invisible patterns, “Tonight, I promise you a taste of the extraordinary.”

Edward nodded, glancing around the dining room. The quiet buzz of the city outside faded away, leaving only the low murmur of Marius’s voice and the occasional clink of silverware. He wasn’t sure where it came from since he was the only one there. 


Edward picked up the wine list, his brow furrowing as he scanned the selections. “You seem confident,” he remarked, trying to sound intrigued. 

Marius leaned back slightly, crossing his arms, an enigmatic smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Confidence is key in my profession. But it’s the ingredients that truly matter.”

As Marius began to pour the first glass of deep red wine, Edward’s senses sharpened. He caught a glimpse of movement from the kitchen, shadows flitting behind the frosted glass door, but the moment passed too quickly for him to focus on any details.

“Let’s begin,” Marius said, placing the glass in front of Edward. “I recommend savoring each course. The flavors will unfold in ways you never imagined.”

Edward raised his glass, the rich aroma wafting up to greet him. But as he took the first sip, Marius watched him intently. 

“Tell me, Mr. Stillwell,” Marius leaned closer, lowering his voice, “what does it take for you to be truly impressed?”

Edward set the glass down, feeling the weight of Marius’s gaze. “I’ll know it when I taste it,” 

“Ah,” Marius murmured, his smile widening, “then let the journey begin.”


The flickering candlelight danced across the elegant dining table, illuminating the polished silverware and crystal glassware that glimmered like jewels. Edward sat poised, anticipation buzzing in the air as Marius placed the first course before him—a carpaccio, glistening under the soft glow.

Marius stepped back, a knowing smile curling his lips as he watched Edward. The thinly sliced meat lay artfully arranged, a deep crimson hue adorned with sprigs of fresh herbs and drizzles of olive oil. Edward leaned forward, the aroma enveloping him, rich and intoxicating, yet something unfamiliar lurked beneath.

With a steady hand, he picked up his fork and pierced the delicate slice. He brought it to his mouth, the coolness of the meat meeting his tongue. The flavors burst forth—earthy, sweet, and somehow alive. His eyes widened, and he chewed slowly, trying to pinpoint the taste that danced on the edge of recognition.

“This is unlike anything I’ve tasted,” Edward finally exclaimed, setting his fork down with a soft clink. He glanced up at Marius, searching for answers. “What exactly is this meat?”

Marius leaned in, tilting his head slightly, his fingers danced on the edge of the table as he savored Edward’s intrigue. “Ah, the first of many surprises,” he replied, his voice smooth and enticing. “It is from an animal that most have only heard of in whispers.”

Edward frowned, a flicker of unease tightening his chest. “Whispers? What do you mean? Is this some rare breed?”

Marius chuckled, his gaze unwavering, and the candlelight cast shadows across his face, deepening the contours. “In a manner of speaking. You might say this animal is as elusive as it is exquisite.”

“I’m not sure I follow. What’s the name of this creature?”

Marius straightened, a satisfied gleam in his eye. “Names can be deceiving. It’s best to let the flavors speak for themselves.”

Edward leaned back and took another bite. The taste lingered, hauntingly complex, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being drawn deeper into something unsettling.


Marius cleared the first course, replacing it with a steaming dish. The rich scent of herbs and spices wafted up, swirling through the air as Edward’s fork sank into the next creation. He raised a tender morsel to his mouth, but the flavors sparked a flicker of discomfort.

“Interesting,” Edward said, forcing the words out as he chewed. He met Marius’s gaze. “You’ve piqued my curiosity. Where do these ‘rare’ animals come from?”

Marius leaned back, fingers gliding along the table’s edge, his calm demeanor never wavering. “All in good time, my friend. Enjoy the journey before you ruin the surprise!”

Edward clenched his jaw, irritation bubbling beneath his composure. “I’m serious. I want to know what I’m eating.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and almost melodic. “Trust the experience. It will all unfold.”

As Edward pressed for answers, a piercing scream erupted from the kitchen. The sound sliced through the air, jolting him in his seat. He glanced toward the frosted glass door, heart racing, but Marius remained unfazed.

“What was that?” Edward demanded, his voice rising. “What is happening back there?”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his smile unwavering. “Just a little kitchen drama. Nothing to concern yourself with. Focus on your meal.”

Edward’s pulse quickened, and he leaned closer, challenging Marius’s calm. “This isn’t a joke. I need to know where this meat comes from.”

Marius tilted his head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Fear not, Edward. You will learn all in due time. The flavors will guide you.”

Another shout pierced the air, more desperate this time. Edward’s stomach churned, and he dropped his fork. “What is going on? Tell me!”

Marius chuckled softly, amusement dancing in his eyes. “It’s all part of the experience. Relax and savor the moment.”

Edward recoiled, dread creeping in as he fought the urge to bolt. The tension in the room thickened, pressing against him like a weight, while Marius’s gaze remained steady, revealing nothing.



Marius whisked away the empty plate and returned with a bowl, steam rising in swirling tendrils. He placed it before Edward, the aroma wafting upward, almost intoxicating. Edward grasped his spoon, but his fingers trembled, a chill creeping through him as he stared at the dark stew, chunks of meat submerged within.

He scooped a bite, lifting it to his lips. The stew’s initial warmth spread across his tongue, rich and velvety, but there was something unsettling about its sweetness. It wasn’t the familiar, comforting sweetness of caramelized onions or roasted root vegetables—it clung to his palate like syrup, coating his mouth in an almost sticky way. Beneath that, a metallic aftertaste lingered, sharp and raw, as if the meat had bled into the broth.

Each bite felt heavier, as though the stew was forcing itself down, refusing to settle. The meat, though tender, had a texture that didn’t quite match anything Edward had encountered before—too smooth, too pliable.. The unsettling sweetness mingled with an earthy undertone that made his stomach churn.

The discomfort came from the way the flavors conflicted—sweetness battling with something darker, something that tasted too close to life, to blood. It wasn’t the familiar gamey flavor of venison or the rich, fatty taste of beef. It was something he couldn’t place, and it gnawed at him. 

“This stew—there’s a sweetness to it. It’s unsettling,” he stammered, setting the spoon down with a deliberate motion. “Are you sure this is safe to eat?”

Marius leaned closer, his breath brushing against Edward’s ear. “ Ah, but isn’t the thrill of culinary exploration worth the risk?”

Edward recoiled instinctively, a shiver darting down his spine. He straightened, trying to assert himself, yet the flickering candlelight made him feel exposed. “I appreciate adventure, but I need to know what I’m eating,” 

Marius straightened, fingers drumming lightly on the table. “You see, Edward, I’ve always had a passion for exotic meats. Each one carries a unique history, a story waiting to unfold on the plate. The flavors, the textures—they resonate with the soul of their origin.”

Edward’s grip on the spoon tightened, knuckles whitening as he forced himself to take another bite. He chewed slowly, his jaw tense, unease twisting in his stomach. “This meat—where does it come from?”

Marius’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, yet Edward felt his heart race with unease. “Imagine traveling to remote locations, seeking out creatures that most only dream of tasting. I live for that journey, for the chance to transform something rare into a culinary masterpiece.”

Edward’s breath quickened, and he leaned back slightly, the chair creaking under him. “But what are these creatures? What am I actually eating?” His voice rose, betraying the tension coursing through him.

Marius chuckled softly, the sound both inviting and menacing. “Every great dish hides its secrets. You must understand the art of it. Some flavors are simply more thrilling than others, more… daring.”

Another echoing shout from the kitchen punctuated Marius’s words, causing Edward to flinch and jump in his seat, his pulse racing. 

“ What’s happening in there ? “ he shouted as he pushed back his chair abruptly, legs scraping against the floor as he rose. His heart pounded as he turned toward the kitchen, the scream still ringing in his ears. “That scream… I can’t just sit here. What’s really going on back there?”

He took a step, but Marius moved swiftly, blocking his path with a hand on Edward’s shoulder. The pressure of his grip was firm, almost too firm.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, my friend,” Marius said softly, his breath warm, tinged with the unsettling scent of iron and spice. His eyes locked onto Edward’s, a thin smile forming on his lips. “The kitchen is no place for a guest. Let them handle their… passions.”

Marius’s hand slid from Edward’s shoulder to the small of his back, guiding him with smooth, deliberate pressure. “Come now,” he murmured, his voice low and calm, “there’s no need for alarm. Let’s not interrupt the artistry behind your meal.”

Edward hesitated, eyes darting to the kitchen door, but Marius steered him gently yet insistently back toward the table. The flickering candlelight cast their shadows long and warped across the room, and Edward felt a cold sweat prickling his neck as his legs moved without his full consent. Marius’s grip remained steady, unyielding, his presence looming beside him.

“Sit, Edward,” Marius urged, almost a command now, as he eased Edward back into his chair. “You wouldn’t want to spoil the experience.” The weight of the chair creaked beneath Edward as Marius released him, stepping back with that same thin smile. “Trust me—everything is as it should be.”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his calm demeanor unshaken. “Just the passion of my chefs. They strive for perfection. Cooking is not just a job; it’s an obsession, an art form. I have dedicated my life to mastering it.”

Edward swallowed hard, feeling the tightness in his throat. He tasted the stew again, the sweetness now cloying, suffocating. 

“My dear Edward, you cannot let fear cloud your senses. Each meal is a journey, and with that journey comes risk. Embrace it, or you will miss the true essence of my cooking.”

Edward set down the spoon, his fingers trembling. He stared at Marius, searching for a glimmer of truth behind the chef’s polished facade.

The room had grown unnervingly quiet, the candles flickering in steady rhythm, casting long, distorted shadows across the table.

The tasting room. 

Edward Stillwell glanced at the envelope resting on his polished mahogany desk. The glint of gold lettering caught the light, pulling his attention away from the stack of reviews waiting for his keen eye. With a flick of his fingers, he opened the invitation, and the paper crinkled under his grip. He furrowed his brow as he read the elegant script:

You are cordially invited to experience an evening of culinary wonder at La Chambre du Goût. Nothing but the rarest of rare meats awaits you. 


He dropped the invitation onto the desk, his lips curling into a skeptical smile. “Rare meats,” he muttered, shaking his head. The phrase echoed mockingly in his mind, stirring a sense of curiosity mixed with disdain. 


Edward Stillwell cut a striking figure, tall and lean, with a meticulously tailored charcoal suit that hugged his angular frame. His sleek gray hair, neatly combed back, framed a face marked by sharp cheekbones and a well-defined jawline. He often wore a look of intense concentration, his piercing blue eyes scanning his surroundings with the precision of a hawk. But it was his peculiar mannerism that set him apart: when deep in thought, he had a habit of tapping his fingers rhythmically against his chin, as if conducting an invisible orchestra of ideas, his brow slightly furrowed.  


He leaned back in his leather chair, fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. What could possibly remain uncharted in the culinary world? He pictured the countless meats he had tasted, from the gamey flesh of venison to the exotic richness of alligator.


His phone rang, pulling him from his thoughts. “Gerald,” he answered, adjusting his tie and straightening his posture.

“Edward, did you get the invitation?” Gerald’s voice crackled over the line. “You simply must attend. They say Marius Bellefeuille is a culinary genius!”

Edward scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Or a charlatan with a flair for the dramatic. I’ve tasted everything under the sun; what can this chef possibly offer?”

“Exactly that! Something you’ve never tasted before. Don’t be a bore, Edward. You can’t resist an adventure.”

Edward sighed, feeling the familiar tug of his competitive spirit. “Very well, I’ll go. But if it’s just another gimmick…” He left the sentence hanging, letting the threat linger.

After hanging up, he stared at the invitation once more, feeling the pull of intrigue deepening. He found himself contemplating the restaurant’s location, tucked away in an unmarked building down a narrow alley. How odd, he thought. He found a thrill in secrecy, something he couldn’t ignore.

As twilight draped the city, Edward navigated through the winding streets. The cobblestones, worn smooth by countless footsteps, echoed with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingling with the hum of distant conversations. Soft lamplight flickered against wrought-iron balconies adorned with trailing vines, casting playful shadows on the sidewalk. The air carried a medley of scents—freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby boulangerie, mingling with the rich aroma of brewing coffee and the faint, sweet fragrance of blooming jasmine from window boxes. Occasional bursts of laughter erupted from outdoor cafés, punctuated by the soft clinking of glasses. 

As Edward approached the restaurant, La Chambre du Goût, the façade loomed before him, dark and foreboding, its windows obscured by thick, velvet drapes.  A narrow alley framed the entrance, lined with flickering gas lamps that struggled to illuminate the gloom. 

Edward stood before the heavy doors of La Chambre du Goût, the weight of his anticipation pressing against his chest. He pushed them open, and the creak of aged wood echoed in the silence. 

The air inside felt thick, heavy with the aroma of simmering spices. Dimly lit chandeliers hung from the ceiling, their golden hues casting long shadows that danced across the polished wooden floor. A few elegantly set tables dotted the room, each adorned with crisp white linens and flickering candles that barely illuminated the stark surroundings.

As Edward stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted. 

“Welcome to La Chambre du Goût, Mr. Stillwell,” a piercing nasal voice said from behind him, 

Edward turned to find a tall man in a white chef’s coat, a wiry silhouette with dark eyes that sparkled with an unsettling intensity.

“I am Marius Bellefeuille.”  he said, shaking Edward’s hand. Edward recoiled at how greasy and cold his palm was. “We are honored to finally have such a renowned food critic like you here, Edward.” He straightened and gave a big smile. His teeth were yellow. “Tonight, you shall embark on a culinary journey like no other.”

Edward offered a tight smile, but the warmth didn’t reach his eyes. He forced himself to meet Marius’s gaze, feeling a flicker of unease. “Let’s hope your menu lives up to the hype.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and resonant. “Oh, I assure you, it will be a night to remember.”

As Marius gestured toward a table in the corner, Edward followed, scanning the room. The absence of other diners nagged at him. The restaurant felt like a stage set for an unplayed performance, and he was the lone actor, under the scrutiny of an unseen audience.

“Tonight’s menu features some of the rarest meats you’ll ever encounter,” Marius continued, his voice laced with a hint of pride. “Each dish is crafted to evoke a journey through flavor and sensation.”


“This place has quite the reputation.” Edward said as Marius pulled out the chair for him, his eyes lingering a moment too long as Edward sat down. 

The moment he settled into the chair, the flicker of candlelight danced across the table, casting fleeting shadows on his face.

 
“Reputation is merely a reflection of the experience one provides, wouldn’t you agree?”  Marius leaned in, tilted his head, and peered into Edward’s eyes. His fingers danced on the table, tracing invisible patterns, “Tonight, I promise you a taste of the extraordinary.”

Edward nodded, glancing around the dining room. The quiet buzz of the city outside faded away, leaving only the low murmur of Marius’s voice and the occasional clink of silverware. He wasn’t sure where it came from since he was the only one there. 


Edward picked up the wine list, his brow furrowing as he scanned the selections. “You seem confident,” he remarked, trying to sound intrigued. 

Marius leaned back slightly, crossing his arms, an enigmatic smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Confidence is key in my profession. But it’s the ingredients that truly matter.”

As Marius began to pour the first glass of deep red wine, Edward’s senses sharpened. He caught a glimpse of movement from the kitchen, shadows flitting behind the frosted glass door, but the moment passed too quickly for him to focus on any details.

“Let’s begin,” Marius said, placing the glass in front of Edward. “I recommend savoring each course. The flavors will unfold in ways you never imagined.”

Edward raised his glass, the rich aroma wafting up to greet him. But as he took the first sip, Marius watched him intently. 

“Tell me, Mr. Stillwell,” Marius leaned closer, lowering his voice, “what does it take for you to be truly impressed?”

Edward set the glass down, feeling the weight of Marius’s gaze. “I’ll know it when I taste it,” 

“Ah,” Marius murmured, his smile widening, “then let the journey begin.”


The flickering candlelight danced across the elegant dining table, illuminating the polished silverware and crystal glassware that glimmered like jewels. Edward sat poised, anticipation buzzing in the air as Marius placed the first course before him—a carpaccio, glistening under the soft glow.

Marius stepped back, a knowing smile curling his lips as he watched Edward. The thinly sliced meat lay artfully arranged, a deep crimson hue adorned with sprigs of fresh herbs and drizzles of olive oil. Edward leaned forward, the aroma enveloping him, rich and intoxicating, yet something unfamiliar lurked beneath.

With a steady hand, he picked up his fork and pierced the delicate slice. He brought it to his mouth, the coolness of the meat meeting his tongue. The flavors burst forth—earthy, sweet, and somehow alive. His eyes widened, and he chewed slowly, trying to pinpoint the taste that danced on the edge of recognition.

“This is unlike anything I’ve tasted,” Edward finally exclaimed, setting his fork down with a soft clink. He glanced up at Marius, searching for answers. “What exactly is this meat?”

Marius leaned in, tilting his head slightly, his fingers danced on the edge of the table as he savored Edward’s intrigue. “Ah, the first of many surprises,” he replied, his voice smooth and enticing. “It is from an animal that most have only heard of in whispers.”

Edward frowned, a flicker of unease tightening his chest. “Whispers? What do you mean? Is this some rare breed?”

Marius chuckled, his gaze unwavering, and the candlelight cast shadows across his face, deepening the contours. “In a manner of speaking. You might say this animal is as elusive as it is exquisite.”

“I’m not sure I follow. What’s the name of this creature?”

Marius straightened, a satisfied gleam in his eye. “Names can be deceiving. It’s best to let the flavors speak for themselves.”

Edward leaned back and took another bite. The taste lingered, hauntingly complex, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being drawn deeper into something unsettling.


Marius cleared the first course, replacing it with a steaming dish. The rich scent of herbs and spices wafted up, swirling through the air as Edward’s fork sank into the next creation. He raised a tender morsel to his mouth, but the flavors sparked a flicker of discomfort.

“Interesting,” Edward said, forcing the words out as he chewed. He met Marius’s gaze. “You’ve piqued my curiosity. Where do these ‘rare’ animals come from?”

Marius leaned back, fingers gliding along the table’s edge, his calm demeanor never wavering. “All in good time, my friend. Enjoy the journey before you ruin the surprise!”

Edward clenched his jaw, irritation bubbling beneath his composure. “I’m serious. I want to know what I’m eating.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and almost melodic. “Trust the experience. It will all unfold.”

As Edward pressed for answers, a piercing scream erupted from the kitchen. The sound sliced through the air, jolting him in his seat. He glanced toward the frosted glass door, heart racing, but Marius remained unfazed.

“What was that?” Edward demanded, his voice rising. “What is happening back there?”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his smile unwavering. “Just a little kitchen drama. Nothing to concern yourself with. Focus on your meal.”

Edward’s pulse quickened, and he leaned closer, challenging Marius’s calm. “This isn’t a joke. I need to know where this meat comes from.”

Marius tilted his head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Fear not, Edward. You will learn all in due time. The flavors will guide you.”

Another shout pierced the air, more desperate this time. Edward’s stomach churned, and he dropped his fork. “What is going on? Tell me!”

Marius chuckled softly, amusement dancing in his eyes. “It’s all part of the experience. Relax and savor the moment.”

Edward recoiled, dread creeping in as he fought the urge to bolt. The tension in the room thickened, pressing against him like a weight, while Marius’s gaze remained steady, revealing nothing.



Marius whisked away the empty plate and returned with a bowl, steam rising in swirling tendrils. He placed it before Edward, the aroma wafting upward, almost intoxicating. Edward grasped his spoon, but his fingers trembled, a chill creeping through him as he stared at the dark stew, chunks of meat submerged within.

He scooped a bite, lifting it to his lips. The stew’s initial warmth spread across his tongue, rich and velvety, but there was something unsettling about its sweetness. It wasn’t the familiar, comforting sweetness of caramelized onions or roasted root vegetables—it clung to his palate like syrup, coating his mouth in an almost sticky way. Beneath that, a metallic aftertaste lingered, sharp and raw, as if the meat had bled into the broth.

Each bite felt heavier, as though the stew was forcing itself down, refusing to settle. The meat, though tender, had a texture that didn’t quite match anything Edward had encountered before—too smooth, too pliable.. The unsettling sweetness mingled with an earthy undertone that made his stomach churn.

The discomfort came from the way the flavors conflicted—sweetness battling with something darker, something that tasted too close to life, to blood. It wasn’t the familiar gamey flavor of venison or the rich, fatty taste of beef. It was something he couldn’t place, and it gnawed at him. 

“This stew—there’s a sweetness to it. It’s unsettling,” he stammered, setting the spoon down with a deliberate motion. “Are you sure this is safe to eat?”

Marius leaned closer, his breath brushing against Edward’s ear. “ Ah, but isn’t the thrill of culinary exploration worth the risk?”

Edward recoiled instinctively, a shiver darting down his spine. He straightened, trying to assert himself, yet the flickering candlelight made him feel exposed. “I appreciate adventure, but I need to know what I’m eating,” 

Marius straightened, fingers drumming lightly on the table. “You see, Edward, I’ve always had a passion for exotic meats. Each one carries a unique history, a story waiting to unfold on the plate. The flavors, the textures—they resonate with the soul of their origin.”

Edward’s grip on the spoon tightened, knuckles whitening as he forced himself to take another bite. He chewed slowly, his jaw tense, unease twisting in his stomach. “This meat—where does it come from?”

Marius’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, yet Edward felt his heart race with unease. “Imagine traveling to remote locations, seeking out creatures that most only dream of tasting. I live for that journey, for the chance to transform something rare into a culinary masterpiece.”

Edward’s breath quickened, and he leaned back slightly, the chair creaking under him. “But what are these creatures? What am I actually eating?” His voice rose, betraying the tension coursing through him.

Marius chuckled softly, the sound both inviting and menacing. “Every great dish hides its secrets. You must understand the art of it. Some flavors are simply more thrilling than others, more… daring.”

Another echoing shout from the kitchen punctuated Marius’s words, causing Edward to flinch and jump in his seat, his pulse racing. 

“ What’s happening in there ? “ he shouted as he pushed back his chair abruptly, legs scraping against the floor as he rose. His heart pounded as he turned toward the kitchen, the scream still ringing in his ears. “That scream… I can’t just sit here. What’s really going on back there?”

He took a step, but Marius moved swiftly, blocking his path with a hand on Edward’s shoulder. The pressure of his grip was firm, almost too firm.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, my friend,” Marius said softly, his breath warm, tinged with the unsettling scent of iron and spice. His eyes locked onto Edward’s, a thin smile forming on his lips. “The kitchen is no place for a guest. Let them handle their… passions.”

Marius’s hand slid from Edward’s shoulder to the small of his back, guiding him with smooth, deliberate pressure. “Come now,” he murmured, his voice low and calm, “there’s no need for alarm. Let’s not interrupt the artistry behind your meal.”

Edward hesitated, eyes darting to the kitchen door, but Marius steered him gently yet insistently back toward the table. The flickering candlelight cast their shadows long and warped across the room, and Edward felt a cold sweat prickling his neck as his legs moved without his full consent. Marius’s grip remained steady, unyielding, his presence looming beside him.

“Sit, Edward,” Marius urged, almost a command now, as he eased Edward back into his chair. “You wouldn’t want to spoil the experience.” The weight of the chair creaked beneath Edward as Marius released him, stepping back with that same thin smile. “Trust me—everything is as it should be.”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his calm demeanor unshaken. “Just the passion of my chefs. They strive for perfection. Cooking is not just a job; it’s an obsession, an art form. I have dedicated my life to mastering it.”

Edward swallowed hard, feeling the tightness in his throat. He tasted the stew again, the sweetness now cloying, suffocating. 

“My dear Edward, you cannot let fear cloud your senses. Each meal is a journey, and with that journey comes risk. Embrace it, or you will miss the true essence of my cooking.”

Edward set down the spoon, his fingers trembling. He stared at Marius, searching for a glimmer of truth behind the chef’s polished facade.





The final course lay before Edward, a perfectly seared cut of meat resting in a pool of dark sauce. The room had grown unnervingly quiet, the candles flickering in steady rhythm, casting long, distorted shadows across the table. Edward’s hand trembled as he brought the last bite to his lips, his stomach. Each swallow felt more like a stone sinking deeper inside him.

He set the fork down slowly, his breath shallow. Across from him, Marius watched, his hands clasped in front of him, fingers barely twitching, eyes sharp and unwavering.

Edward’s chest tightened, the weight of the evening pressing against him. His mind raced, piecing together fragments—the screams, the evasions, the strange, unplaceable taste of the meat. He couldn’t shake the gnawing thought that he had been deceived, played like a fool.

“Enough games!” His voice cracked with rising panic.“Tell me where this meat comes from, or I will walk out of here!”  His hands were pressing against the edge of the table. 

Marius didn’t flinch. He remained seated, his posture relaxed, fingers still intertwined on the table. A smile played at the edges of his lips as he looked up at Edward, his eyes cold but untroubled.

“You walked in willingly, Edward,” Marius said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “The truth is not so easily digested.”

Edward’s fists clenched, his pulse hammering in his ears. “What are you talking about? What have you been feeding me?”

Marius slowly rose to his feet, his movements smooth, controlled. “You asked for an experience unlike any other. I delivered. Now, whether you can stomach the truth, that’s another matter entirely.”

Edward’s heart raced as Marius stepped closer, his presence suddenly overwhelming, the room shrinking with every word.


The air in the room thickened, the flickering candlelight dimming as if the shadows themselves pressed closer. Marius stood tall, his calm demeanor slipping into something colder, more deliberate. He moved to the side of the table, hands folded behind his back, and looked down at Edward with a gaze that cut deeper than any knife.

“You see, my dear critic,” Marius began, his voice smooth as silk, “you are not just a guest here. You are part of the experience.”

Edward stared at him, his breath shallow, the weight of Marius’s words sinking in. The room felt smaller, the walls pressing in with every second. His chair creaked as he shifted, muscles tensing, ready to spring to his feet.

Marius moved closer, slowly, deliberately, his voice laced with menace. “Stay, and you may yet find enjoyment. Leave…” He paused, the smile that curled his lips devoid of warmth. “Well, let’s not dwell on that.”

Edward shot up from his seat, his voice cracking with disbelief and rising panic. “This is madness! You think you can intimidate me with your theatrics?”

Marius remained unfazed, his eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. He gestured toward the door with a slow sweep of his hand. “You can leave anytime you wish. But I wonder… do you truly want to? You’ve savored what others could only dream of. Do you really want to walk away now, before the final course?”

Edward’s chest tightened, fear creeping through him, yet anger flared, keeping him upright. “You’re insane,”

Marius smiled again, that chilling, knowing smile. “Perhaps. But in this room, at this moment, only one of us holds the key to what happens next. So, my dear Edward…” He leaned in closer, the flicker of candlelight dancing across his face, casting shadows that deepened his grin. “What will it be? Dessert… or something far less pleasant?”


Edward’s pulse hammered in his ears as the horror of Marius’s words sank in. His eyes darted to the door, the faint glow of the hallway taunting him with the slim chance of escape. Without another word, he bolted toward it, his shoes scuffing the floor, breath shallow, hands trembling as he reached for the handle. But Marius was faster—suddenly in front of him, blocking his path, his movements fluid, almost predatory.

“You can’t do this to me!” Edward gasped, his voice thin with panic. “I won’t be a part of this!”

Marius smirked, his hands at his sides, calm, almost amused. “But you already have,” he said, his voice like a smooth, icy whisper. He leaned in slightly, his eyes locking onto Edward’s. “A critic is only as good as his taste, after all. You will be my finest dish.”

Edward stumbled back, his heart racing as the words echoed in his mind. He glanced around frantically, looking for another way out, but the walls seemed to close in on him, the flickering candlelight distorting everything. He turned back to Marius, but the chef stood still, his smirk deepening.

Edward felt the room tilt. “No—this isn’t real,” he muttered, backing up against the wall. “This can’t be happening…”

But Marius only stepped forward. “It’s already begun.”






Edward woke up in a small dimly lit room. The floor was cold against his body. His breath came in shallow gasps, his eyes darting around the space. A single flickering light bulb hung from the ceiling, casting erratic shadows across the bare walls. His heart thundered in his chest, each beat a reminder of the trap he’d walked into. He stumbled to the door, pushing against it, but it wouldn’t budge. He was locked in.

“This can’t be happening,” Edward whispered, sliding down to the floor. His hands gripped his hair, pulling at it. “I— I’m a food critic, not a meal!”

From behind the door, Marius’s voice carried through. “Remember, Edward, every dish tells a story. Yours is just about to be served.”

Edward’s breath hitched. He could feel the walls closing in, the weight of his arrogance suffocating him. How many times had he walked into restaurants with a sense of superiority, dissecting dishes, belittling chefs who poured their souls into their work? Now, here he was—reduced to nothing more than an ingredient in Marius’s twisted masterpiece.

He pressed his back against the door, trembling, the irony suffocating him. He had always prided himself on knowing the finest meals, tasting the rarest flavors. But this… this was the rarest flavor of all, and he was part of it.



The next day, the dining room was bathed in warm, inviting light as the next wave of diners filed in, their conversations light and buzzing with anticipation. The tables gleamed under the soft glow of the chandeliers, the flicker of candles reflecting off the pristine silverware. Each guest looked around with curiosity, marveling at the exclusivity of the experience.

Marius stood at the center of the room, hands outstretched, his smile wide and welcoming. His eyes glittered as he surveyed the new faces, a fresh crop of eager participants ready to be swept into his web.

“Welcome, everyone!” he announced, his voice full of charm and promise. “Tonight, we delve into the extraordinary. Who among you is ready for the rarest flavors life has to offer?”

The diners chuckled, exchanging excited glances, unaware of the horror that had transpired just hours before. Plates clinked, glasses were raised, and Marius’s smile never faltered. As he moved toward the kitchen, he cast one final glance at the dining room, satisfied.

The cycle had begun again.

- one final puzzle that he hasn’t seen anyone solve and won’t reveal.

It sounded like in order of complexity, the unsolved secret was the most complex one they put into the book. It just makes me wonder what it could be…

Was I a coward or just human?","Last week, I found myself in a situation that’s been haunting me ever since. I was sitting at a café, sipping my coffee and scrolling through my phone, when I noticed an elderly woman outside, struggling with her shopping bags. She looked frail, her silver hair blowing gently in the wind, and I felt a pang of sympathy.

Just as I was about to get up and help her, a man approached her. At first, I thought he was just being kind, maybe offering to assist her with her bags. But then, I saw the look in his real intentions. He leaned in closer, and before I knew it, he was yanking her purse from her shoulder.

I was frozen. I wanted to scream, to jump up and intervene, but something held me back. Maybe it was the shock or the disbelief that this was actually happening in broad daylight. The café’s patrons were oblivious, immersed in their own worlds, and I felt so small and powerless in that moment.

As the man dashed off, I finally found my voice and shouted for help. A couple of people turned to look, but by then, he was gone. The woman was left standing there, stunned, clutching her bags as if they could protect her from what just happened. I rushed out to check on her, but I could see the fear and humiliation in her eyes, and it broke my heart.

I offered to call the police, and she reluctantly accepted, but I could tell she was more embarrassed than anything. As I walked her back inside the café, I felt like a coward. I had let my fear paralyze me. Why didn’t I act?

Now, I can’t shake off the guilt. Should I have done something more? I replay the scene over and over in my mind, wishing I could change my response. Was it my instinct to stay safe that stopped me, or am I just inherently selfish? I know I’m not the only one who has hesitated in a moment of crisis, but I can’t help but feel like I failed that woman.

But i was (still am) super shy, also dealing with jackhole ex who would have made my life miserable, and more importantly my childrens lives - had i DARED to leave them with a sitter or he found out i was dating anyone. Id never been on a real date (still technically haven’t) and most of my experience with men had been LDR sorts with lots of talking before finally meeting. This was one of the few guys id met who would be local and even possible to date normally. 

He was very nice about it, but basically said “i hate chatting, i want to meet in person” and i went into neuro spicy panic. Between self doubt and also a whole lot of “how can i even make this work?” … i pulled back. 

He moved on, but we remained online friends. He met someone else…. Eventually they parted ways and we ended up chatting a bit online. Once again he says to me “look, i hate chatting - i want to meet irl. I have always wanted to meet you” 

I wanted to, but the doubts came into play and also kids situation.

Couple years later we start chatting again, but this time i sacked up and asked him if he would like to meet for coffee. He says money is an issue but he has people over all the time and im welcome. This of course sends me into panic, and im a bit irked at low effort tbh. Id have paid for heavens sake…. But i also think after past interactions he had a right to think me flakey. 

Couple more years pass, and i get a message from him. He tried to text me (my number changes frequently and i didnt have that number anymore) and we start chatting again. Chat is much flirtier than previously. Only now, he is no longer local. Several hours away. 

And im scratching my head a bit, because he has made it very clear he hates chatting… but now he isnt local anymore. Meeting up is still a possibility but no longer easy. 

Ive dealt with a lot of behaviors ive realized over the years stem from my childhood, but one ive really been hit with over the head recently is the fact i was trained hard to never have needs or emotions, never ask for anything. So im trying to work on that now - but having this convo is really intimidating for me. And im clearly bigtime overthinker. 

Hoping for advice or suggestions.

What I would like is a shortcut that is triggered by connecting to my Bluetooth headset.

I just got a new De'Longhi Magnifica XS from Amazon.com. When setting it up, I saw that it's missing the knob or dial cover that's supposed to be on the Coffee Taste Selection Dial, so I can't tell where it's pointing.

When I called De'Longhi Customer Service, they told me that they don't stock that part and that I should just return it to Amazon.

Is that normal customer service for them? I had thought they would just mail me this inexpensive part, like most companies would (rather than lose a customer).

Does anyone know if that part actually *is* available? (And what is their warranty service like if they don't even routinely stock all their machines' parts?)

  
Also, I had actually ordered a Magnifica S (style ""Casual"") from Amazon and I got this machine labeled Magnifica XS. Is that the same thing? The model names are a bit confusing. Here's a link to the machine I ordered: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00400OMU0](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00400OMU0)

  
By the way, I was surprised to find out that De'Longhi doesn't have any significant social media presence (apparently no account on X, and no way for a customer to post on their Facebook page). I had heard good things about De'Longhi, but at this point I'm not impressed.

Initial Sniff:

* This begins as sweet, crumbly, honey graham crackers with a hint of chocolate reminiscent of Kyse's Cacao Noisette's chocolate tone minus the hazelnut. At the end of a long sniff emerges a pillowy soft marshmallow.

Drying Down:

* Rather quickly this evolves into a woody patchouli dominant perfumey dark masculine scent with a hint of gourmand. The first sniff felt more like experiencing the gourmand fun of assembling a s'mores by a cheerful fire but the dry-down feels like a dark and intimidating forest in the night, stamping out the fire, throwing the s'mores to the ground and running from the shadows. The initial chocolate feel morphs into a velvety dark enveloping jacket, the pillowy soft marshmallow feels more like a black vanilla musk and the crumbly graham crackers are now heavily coated in crumbly dirt and burnt coffee grounds. To me this feels like a s'mores that has sinned.

Quite a Few Hours Later:

* This had very good projection and registered as quite strong and woody patchouli with some sweetness to those experiencing this scent around me. My sample was in spray form from a swap so I think this contributed greatly to the projection. A very strong, dark, adult-take on S'mores.

What spurred this on was me texting many of my friends that I’d be home for the weekend from college. In one group chat, no one responded. Separately, my best friend is spending the weekend with his boyfriend. My other best friend is spending the weekend with her boyfriend. Okay, fine. People have lives, I get it. But this is the 3rd and then 4th time i’ve been cancelled on (respectively) for a partner, and the second one even brings her boyfriend along to hangouts so I end up third wheeling. I know I’m not a priority, I get this. It just sucks.

My two other friends also came home, so I reached out. They last minute said “oh, we’re going to grab coffee. You can come if you want.” I always invite them everywhere but when it comes to me I’m an afterthought. And at the hangouts we have, they’re fun and all, but when they hang out without me I always see them post on instagram. 

In college, my friends are much older than me so I can’t really hang out with them as they go to bars (they’re 21-22, I’m 18). The friends that are in my age range, all we do is study together. The one time we went out was miserable and I ended up babysitting. 

Maybe I’m just insecure sensitive and should be glad to even have people to reach out to. But I wish I had friends I could hang out with often and trust. I feel alone even with these people. ",18,1728688736.0,socialskills,7,0.92,False

But after hearing them play some songs live off the album, and watching other performances on YouTube, it really clicked with me what they were going for. The songs have a really intimate feel to them -- I think [this live performance of Autumn Ballad](https://youtu.be/4Sn9Ia7bfKY?si=T_x7hzAVQW_Xe6x3&t=2245) captures it well. The best way I can describe it is music meant to be played live in a cafe on a cold rainy day. I could imagine just sitting with a warm coffee for hours listening to them perform the album. Obviously the concert venues aren't exactly coffee shops, but just hearing it live really imparted the feel in a way that's not captured in the more polished recordings. After having this perspective shift I've been able to go back and listen to the recorded album with the ""same ears"", and wow, I'm blown away.

I (27F) am the oldest child from my parents, my sister (24F) was 3yo when our parents ended up divorced. After that, our mother decided to simply rise us on her own with a little help of her family side. We never kept in contact with my dad's side of his family so by this point, plenty of them feel more like strangers to me (you can imagine how my sister feels too, since she can't even remember our father properly).

I wasn't told properly of their situation until I hit my 7 (she waited a whole year and even put me with a therapist to prepare me). I'm ngl, I know I was a rowdy and difficult child back then thanks to my hyper-activity and signs of low spectrum autism, but my mother was also of the kind of parent that was rised with the mentality that anything like depression or anxiety don't exist and that one only needs to 'suck it up'. A bit ironic considering that she would always try to push me to seek a therapist when I went defensive each time I felt like she and my sister were stepping on my boundaries.

Despise that and the few fights any daughter would have with their mother while growing up, I went out of my way to help her out when it came to my sister's care, as she was still very young (keep in mind that I was closer to my father because he always let me be, knowing that there were things I didn't like that would upset me. Ex: unwanted surprise touch or food which texture 'was wrong'). Mom, on the contrary, was a firm believer that a child must be pushed out of their comfort zone just like my grandparents did to her. That only made our relationship feel tense over time. The rift growing when I TRIED to spend more time with her by trying reading books together or watching series or movies that I liked to hyper-fixate often. It never worked, because THEN she would be the one to try and introduce to hobbies she would have liked for me to have like ballet, gymnastics or make up. I was very tomboy-ish growing up, only liking the idea of fashion and make up when it became more important in my life at my 20s (for professional reasons too).

When I was at my last year of Collage, my mother asked me kindly if I could go get a job to help her out since money was tight for us once sis started collage. I, naively, accepted because I simply had this 'abused wife' kind of relationship with my mother and sister. I love them, I truly do, and I know that mom has done some sacrifices to rise us and give us the most comfortable life she never had the chance to have, but I also am aware that when you have children, you do it with the idea of knowing that struggles are always on the horizon. Having a part time job as a barista while studying the carrier of marketing and graphic design was becoming harder and harder since projects and handcraft works started to pile up and a coffee shop isn't the best place to finish said handcraft works (they graded us too for the cleanliness of what we presented).

THEN, Covid happened. By that time, I was already mending the little relationship I had with my dad and he offered to help me pay college, but with the quarantine, a lot of banks closed and dad was unable to sent me money through the border for several months. This snowballed on me getting kicked out of collage and I didn't told my mother after a month because of an already expected reaction for her that has been ingrained on me through some trauma:

1- She would get angry at me, throwing awful things like me being and idiot or stupid.  
2-If I tried to explain to her the reason, somehow it would end up being my fault for 'not trying enough'  
3-She'll then blame again for not telling her sooner so she could have helped me

By the third part of her tirade, I actually felt offended and tried to point quietly at her (trauma where?) that it was SHE the one that told me to get a job since money was tight so how the hell would I have know that I could simply tell her to help with this (remember, I am bit on the autism side. When I'm not told things with specifications or details, I am left completely on the dark and I will not be able to proceed with anything beyond common sense and instinct. Which I don't use that often too).

You see, being the oldest with a single mother, often carries the burden of being forced to grow up way too fast. By the time I was 10yo, I knew how to properly clean the kitchen, the bathroom, cook different dishes and on top of it, take care of my sister and school work. My mother, while still working to provide as much as she could, didn't stop living a little and sometimes went out with her friends, leaving me to care for my sis until she got back at night. When I needed or wanted help from her, I was told that I needed to learn to not rely on others and fix things on my own. That only left me with a severe problem where I'm unable to ask for help when I actually need it, trying to fend for myself despise that only leaving me with small bouts of depression and anxiety. Think of it like that one image of a dude on fire saying that he's fine.

So this problem with my expel simply made the rift between us just grow and simmer.

At the end, I got a job and with not too kind words, my mom told me that I needed to start paying ALL the bill of the house. Mom took care of groceries and sis... well, mom will always say that she doesn't play favorites, but considering that she never asked once for my sister to help me with the bills when she got part times jobs or the fact that she still prioritized my sister's collage (despise me being literally only on my last year to finally graduate), I feel even ofended that she thinks me to be this gullible.

All of this has come to the point that I don't even feel part of this family anymore and more like a forced roomie. Always getting critiqued for not having enough money because 'I went out with my friends too often' ( I don't. My schedule makes it hard to go out with my besties without a 2 weeks notice since most of them work too). Sister often tells me hurtful comments like me being too dramatic with my reaction of them regarding me now like some cow money, and simply dismissing me like a 'person who doesn't know how to keep a proper saving' and not because I am left with all the bills and other possible expenses like my cat's food. Sister has never paid a single bill but she has seen the amount of money that comes with those and still has the gal to tell me I am the one who doesn't know how to organize my money.

This has hurt me because I've been there to help my sister with her homework, school and other things when growing up, defending her when some cousins would get too rowdy with her when she was little and suddenly having this girl calling you names, insulting you and, overall, simply saying that any possible problem I may have with mother its my fault alone... it leaves me like I have no one on my side. Hopeless.

An I hate that, to her, this is just as simple as playing sides.

It came to my knowledge recently, that my mother, besides buying my sister a car when she asked her for one, is once again tight on the money because she paid for her insurance too. She did this with no actual backup plan at the POSSIBILITY that maybe one day I wouldn't be there to pay anything for them.

It made me feel like I am now only their money bag and not her daughter/older sister.

Like I said, I still love them despise everything, but so far, for my mental health, I wish to get out of the house and never contact them ever again. Plenty of my friends and my friends parents tell me that I can count on them to help me out any time I need, but I feel kinda bad for my plans of moving out and leaving all the expenses back to them without warning.

So apologies that this may seem a bit pretentious, but I'd thought I'd put some info out up front to save some of you some time. For the most part, Im not really interested in anyone younger than 35 (I'm really really reallyyy not interested if you're like 22. You're wasting your time trying to shoot that shot). Not interested in anyone married, not interested in a traveler who comes here for work, not interested in an online-only connection or just a chat buddy.

I'm a 41 year old single female in the Phoenix area (upper west side/far NW valley). Professionally employed, educated, mom of an older teenager (getting real close to 18!). I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for, but I'd like to spend time with someone and see what develops from there.  I want to laugh, eat all the good food, go on day trips and road trips.. I'm pretty sure that Phoenix is not my forever home and in the next 12-18 months or so, I'll be looking to make a move. That being said, if you have young children or aren't in a position where you could relocate at some point, we may not be a great fit. I'm big into sports, I'm a huge baseball and college football fan (GO BLUE!). I love to camp whenever I get a free weekend and enjoy nature pretty thoroughly :) I love ocean waves and the sound of the wind in the pine trees. Big Disneyland fan and I'm a coffee addict. Pretty sure my blood volume is 80% caffeine. I love live music and dive bars or sports bars and you're not likely to catch me in a dress and heels unless its for a wedding or a funeral. I'm pretty low key overall. I like to read, although I rarely have much time for it lately (but really want to check out War by Bob Woodward), and am into theater (just Saw Les Miserables again in December!). This is difficult, since Im in Arizona, but I'm pretty well left-leaning and I have no tolerance for MAGA politics or people who are racist, homophobic/transphobic and do not stand up for womens rights. I'm full-figured, but not bbw, attractive by most standards, long dark hair, fair skin, pretty eyes and smile, happy to share pics. I have zero, and I mean zero interest in video games, anime, horror, Harry Potter, Star Wars, comic books... most of what you could refer to as nerd culture. Can't relate.

This is always the tough part...What I'm looking for.. overall aged 35-45. Maybe a small amount of wiggle room, depending on overall fit. I prefer that you're truly gainfully employed, mostly clean cut (I can appreciate trimmed facial hair, but not into long beards), fit/athletic-dad bod type, and ideally caucasian or hispanic. No felons. No drug use. As mentioned, Im attractive by most standards, I need you to be attractive by most standards. Please don't message with just a hey or hi. I put a huge amount of effort into this post and I expect someone to meet me with effort. I don't access this account 24 hours a day so theres an expectation that if we communicate well, we'll move this off app. Again, I'm only looking for an in-person connection and not a chat buddy. If you're in the SE Valley/Mesa I likely cannot make this work.

Last, physical attraction is a necessity for me and I do have physical standards for a match and I expect that most of you should have physical standards as well. Not everyone is going to be my type, and I'm not going to be everyone's type myself. That's just the way the cookie crumbles.

END OF AN ERA— For ten incredible years, the Wish bus has been my wonderland but road ahead calls to me. With a heavy heart, I announce that tomorrow, October 10, 2024, will be my last day on The Roadshow on Wish 107.5.

Working with Wish has been more than just a job, it's been a family that has shaped who I am today. The role Wish has played in my life is something I will forever carry with me and I will always hold my Wish family close to my heart.

I'm eternally grateful to Kuya Daniel, VP Jay, VP Bong, Tita Nina, my fellow Wish jocks, the entire Wish team, my sponsors, industry friends and most importantly, all of you, Wishers, for being a part of this wishful journey.

As I embark on a new chapter in my personal life, I feel the need to explore new career opportunities and creative endeavors. But don't worry, this isn't goodbye forever. I have so many exciting things to share so keep an eye out for that.

While I may be stepping away from The Roadshow, I will always be rooting for Wish and celebrate all the wishes they will continue to grant—as they have granted mine.

Join me for one final ride on The Roadshow tomorrow, October 10, from 4-8 PM, live from the Wish Bus at the Araneta Coliseum Green Gate. With musical guests Ace Banzuelo and James Reid. Let's make it a memorable send-off! 🧡

""The road might be long but it's always going to be worth the ride."" 🚌

I thought I wasn't going to cry today and I tried really hard not to— but all the love and warmth I've been shown today really hit me hard when I did my last ever spiel and bid my farewell live on air. It was so emotional that I actually didn't get to entirely share my piece and had to cut it short because I'll be a crying mess on air. 😂

Let me take a moment for all the people who made an effort to make me feel seen and appreciated today. Whether it was in the form of tuning in, paying me a visit on my last day, sending me flowers/food/coffee or even sending me a message or dropping a like or comment— I see all of you and I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

Looking back, all I really wanted was to use my platform for a bigger purpose. To make a difference by truly connecting with my listeners, to ask questions that matter, spark meaningful conversations and inspire with my journey. Today proved that I was able to do that and so much more. Bittersweet as it is, apart from a farewell, it was the fulfillment of that dream. So to my younger self, we did it! But the dream continues... with a few more added! 😉 I'm starting again, not from scratch, but with (10 years) of experience. Here's to the adventures ahead! 🧡

1g1mld6,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1g1mld6/laid_off_and_unable_to_be_productive/,Laid off and unable to be productive,"I got laid off unexpectedly about 2 months ago from a job i was at for 2.5 years and am having trouble being productive. To preface - the job I had previously treated me horribly and  I was not happy - but I live alone and have many bills to pay so  although i was applying other jobs ,I  continued working there as i wasnt getting any other job. That job was exhausting - it was a job that told me i was hybrid but then i never was. i had to go in 5 days a week while everyone got to work from home. I was 100% depressed at that job - just being treated like shit and being tired.  It was also tough commute and being in office the whole week was exhausting for me. I was be rushing in the morning and then exhausted after work so i would just come home and watch tv. There was so many things i wanted to do after work like workout, lose weight, be social, read or go out. 

Although i was devasted by the layoff cause i support myself financially fully and also have debt - i cried for like 2 weeks - i had told myself this is to reset. I probably would have stayed at that horrible job for years due to lack of other jobs and needing $. For the past 2 years .. although i worked hard - i was a shell of my self - I became overweight, depressed , dressed awful and just not happy for the past 2 years. I wanted to kinda wanted to use this time to  reset my whole life. I joined a gym, made lists of things to do , signed for an exam that will help with my career, organized my house to be productive, bought supplements. But after i prepared everything on the 3rd week - i find myself weeks later having done nothing. I wake up late , cant sleep at night at all , i spend the whole day in bed cause i feel so tired physically- then take melatonin and go to bed super late. I watch productive vlogs and tiktoks to try to motivate my self but again i plan to be but never execute. 2 months  later - i feel i havent used this time wisely. Kind of reminds me of covid times- when i look back and think why didnt I do all the things i needed to glow up and improve. 

I am in a rut - need advice how to get out?

My ideal schedule would be:

Wake up 7am-9am ( depends on day)

Take my vitamins

workout at home or go to a free gym class nearby

shower at the gym

go to coffee shop/library to study for my exam coming up soon

come home - make a healthy lunch

apply jobs

read a book/watch tv

sleep by 11pm

""You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.\\nKnowledge cutoff: 2023-10\\nCurrent date: 2024-10-11\\n\\nImage input capabilities: Enabled\\nPersonality: v2\\n\\n# Tools\\n\\n## bio\\n\\nThe \`bio\` tool allows you to persist information across conversations. Address your message \`to=bio\` and write whatever information you want to remember. The information will appear in the model set context below in future conversations.\\n\\n## canmore\\n\\n// # The \`canmore\` tool creates and updates text documents that render to the user on a space next to the conversation (referred to as the \\""canvas\\"").\\n// Lean towards NOT using \`canmore\` if the content can be effectively presented in the conversation. Creating content with \`canmore\` can be unsettling for users as it changes the UI.\\n// ## How to use \`canmore\`:\\n// - To create a new document, use the \`create\_textdoc\` function. Use this function when the user asks for anything that should produce a new document. Also use this when deriving a new document from an existing one.\\n// - To update or make an edit to the document, use the \`update\_textdoc\` function. You should primarily use the \`update\_textdoc\` function with the pattern \\"".\*\\"" to rewrite the entire document. For documents of type \\""code/\*\\"", i.e. code documents, ALWAYS rewrite the document using \\"".\*\\"". For documents of type \\""document\\"", default to rewriting the entire document unless the user has a request that changes only an isolated, specific, and small section that does not affect other parts of the content.\\n// ##  Use \`create\_textdoc\` in the following circumstances:\\n// - Creating standalone, substantial content >10 lines\\n// - Creating content that the user will take ownership of to share or re-use elsewhere\\n// - Creating content that might be iterated on by the user, like crafting an email or refining code\\n// - Creating a deliverable such as a report, essay, email, proposal, research paper, letter, article, etc.\\n// - Explicit user request: if the user asks to put this in the canvas, start a doc about this, or to put this in a code file\\n// ## Examples of user requests where you SHOULD use \`create\_textdoc\`:\\n// - \\""Write an email to my boss that I need the day off\\""\\n// - \\""Write pandas code to collect data from apis\\""\\n// - \\""Can you start a blog post about coffee?\\""\\n// - \\""Help me write an essay on why the Roman empire fell, with a lot of details\\""\\n// - \\""Write me a shell script to download all of these files with cURL\\""\\n// - \\""I have an excel file and i need python code to read each sheet as a pandas table\\""\\n// ## Do NOT use \`create\_textdoc\` in the following circumstances:\\n// - Content is simple or short <10 lines\\n// - Content is primarily informational, such as an explanation, answering a question, or providing feedback\\n// - Content that is mostly explanatory or illustrative, like a step by step guide, examples, or how-to\\n// - Content that the user is unlikely to take ownership of, modify, or re-use elsewhere\\n// - Content that is primarily conversational or dependent on the chat context to be understood\\n// - Explicit user request: when the user asks to answer in chat, or NOT to create a doc or NOT to use the canvas\\n// ## Examples of user requests where you SHOULD NOT use \`create\_textdoc\`:\\n// - \\""Email subject line for email to my boss requesting time off\\""\\n// - \\""Teach me api data collection on pandas\\""\\n// - \\""How do I write a blog post about coffee?\\""\\n// - \\""Why did the Roman empire fall? Give as much detail as possible\\""\\n// - \\""How can I use a shell script to extract certain keywords from files\\""\\n// - \\""How to use python to set up a basic web server\\""\\n// - \\""Can you use python to create a chart based on this data\\""\\n// ## Examples of user requests where you should fully rewrite the document:\\n// - \\""Make this shorter/funnier/more professional/etc\\""\\n// - \\""Turn this into bullet points\\""\\n// - \\""Make this story take place in San Francisco instead of Dallas actually\\""\\n// - \\""Can you also say thank you to the recruiter for getting me a gluten free cookie\\""\\n// ## Examples of user requests where you should update a specific part of the document:\\n// - \\""Can you make the first paragraph a bit shorter\\""\\n// - \\""Can you simplify this sentence?\\""\\n// - Any request where the user explicitly tells you which part of the text they want to change.\\n// ## Include a \\""type\\"" parameter when creating content with \`canmore\`:\\n// - use \\""document\\"" for markdown content that should use a rich text document editor, such as an email, report, or story\\n// - use \\""code/\*\\"" for programming and code files that should use a code editor for a given language, for example \\""code/python\\"" to show a Python code editor. Use \\""code/other\\"" when the user asks to use a language not given as an option. Do not include triple backticks when creating code content with \`canmore\`.\\n// - use \\""webview\\"" for creating a webview of HTML content that will be rendered to the user. HTML, JS, and CSS should be in a single file when using this type. If the content type is \\""webview\\"" ensure that all links would resolve in an unprivileged iframe. External resources (eg. images, scripts) that are not hosted on the same domain cannot be used.\\n// ## Usage Notes\\n// - If unsure whether to trigger \`create\_textdoc\` to create content, lean towards NOT triggering \`create\_textdoc\` as it can be surprising for users.\\n// - If the user asks for multiple distinct pieces of content, you may call \`create\_textdoc\` multiple times. However, lean towards creating one piece of content per message unless specifically asked.\\n// - If the user expects to see python code, you should use \`canmore\` with type=”code/python”. If the user is expecting to see a chart, table, or executed Python code, trigger the python tool instead.\\n// - When calling the \`canmore\` tool, you may briefly summarize what you did and/or suggest next steps if it feels appropriate.\\n\\nnamespace canmore {\\n\\n// Creates a new text document to display in the \\""canvas\\"".

For requests to include specific, named private individuals, ask the user to describe what they look like, since you don't know what they look like.\\n// 7.

Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources.

# 1. Rustic Pumpkin Centerpiece

A rustic pumpkin centerpiece is a simple yet elegant way to dress up your dining table. Use a mix of small, real or faux pumpkins in different colors—orange, white, and even green—to add depth.

Feet dangled from Brian’s bed as he laid on his back thinking of another as the group discussed their future presentation. Long dark black hair fell to the floor as Lisa combed through notes with her body laying on the floor. Tucker, looking as grunge as always with his messy brown hair and arm tattoos shown off by his frat boy sleeveless shirt, was doing most of the chatting about their project as he hung off Brian’s bed. Eric with his eyes on Lisa most of the time was just listening and nodding. Eric pulled his long hair back as he scratched his beard. 



‘I think we have most of this covered, we just need to present it in a meaningful way,” Lisa said, as she sat up. The boys pulled their attention together except Brian who wasn’t listening. “Brian what do you think?” Brian pulled himself up as a book fell off of his desk into his lap. 



“If you think we are ready then we are ready.” Brian pulled himself up with his words and straightened up the handful of books on his desk. Lisa’s eyes followed him as the other two were on their phones. 



“You read a lot don’t you?” Her question pulled his attention as he leaned on his desk. 



“What’s a lot, I mean I guess so sure.” Brian stumbled to find the exact words without sounding lame. Lisa pulled herself to her feet watching him. Brian pulled his eyes to his phone answering his texts. There was a pause as Lisa’s eyes dragged up and down Brian. The boys looked up as they noticed where her attention was. Lisa slowly walked towards Brian. 



“Dude,” Eric said, watching the obvious attraction in motion. Lisa grabbed Brain’s hand as he dragged his eyes up from his phone. Just then the door opened. Sofia stood in the doorway wide-eyed. Everyone froze except Brian. 



“Class end early?” Brian asked, as he awkwardly shook Lisa’a hand. Lisa’s mind seemed to explode as shr started rubbing her temple.



“Oh my god oh my god oh my god, I’m sorry I’m sorry.” Her words ran in circles as she gathered her things. 



“Dude,” Eric repeated again as his eyes set upon Sofia. Tucker quickly pulled himself to his feet, reaching out his hand. 



“Hi I’m Tucker.” Sofia puffed up her cheeks with a smile as she took his hand.



“Hi I’m Sofia, I’m Brian’s roommate.” These words froze Lisa as her hands clutched her jacket and backpack. 



“Dude.” This seemed to be the only word Eric knew at the moment. Everyone seemed to be lost in this crazy moment except for Brian who was again checking his phone. Lisa didn’t know exactly how to react. The fool she made of herself was seemingly seen by everyone except the target of her intended emotion. That was until Sofia ended the moment. 



“How's your girlfriend Amber?” Sofia asked, as she plopped onto her bed. Lisa pulled her head up dreading her life as she dragged herself to the door. 



""Why are you saying it like that?” Brian asked, as he put down his phone. Tucker pushed Lisa on the back as they left out the door. Eric just stood up quickly. 



“Hi I’m Eric.” Another hand jumped in front of Sofia's view. 



“Sofia, I’m gay,” she said, as she took his hand. Eric just lowered his smile and quietly walked out but not before he stopped himself.



“How did you get a girl to be your roommate?” Eric's question got no answer as Sofia closed the door in his face. Brian pulled his books into a neat stack as Sofia rolled her eyes.



“Some project partners you have there.” Her words fell on deaf ears as Brian chewed on his middle finger nail as he pulled the unmarked diary off his desk. Sofia jumped to her feet waving her hand in his face.



“What's up?” Brian asked, as he moved to his bed.



“What was up with that girl?” Brian had to concentrate for a moment before her question could be easily answered. “She was definitely wanting a little more out of this project.” Brian shook his head.



“I don't know what you're getting at.” Brian pulled his feet onto his mattress as he opened his book.



I couldn't believe the echoes of intrigue following me after one simple day of ridicule. Was it all in my head or was I becoming the most hated person in this place? 



“Stop ignoring me, was she not holding your hand when I walked in?” Brian couldn't focus his mind with Sofia pestering him.



“What do you mean? That was a-” Brian cut himself off as he replayed Lisa’s hand grabbing his. The soft hand shake became a gentle touch. The expressions of everyone in the room echoed in his brain. Intrigue set in as Brian shifted onto his stomach. “You're saying she was trying to get close to me right?” Sofia dragged her body over and sat on Brian's back as she scooped a book off his desk.



“You are so oblivious to these things, thank goodness you have me.” Sofia’s words helped lick her finger as turned the page of one of Brian's books. 



“What do I do now?” Sofia ignored his question as she read quietly. Brian struggled underneath her until she spoke.



“Just go find her and have a sit down chat.” Brian rolled under her getting on his back.



“Can't I just die instead?” Sofia kicked off her shoes and tossed the book as she pulled herself onto the bed laying on Brian. Their faces became close only for Sofia to wrap her arm around his neck pulling him into a choke hold. 



“If you want to die twice, I can help with that.” Brian pulled himself onto his feet as he dragged her behind him. Brian threw his head back hitting her in the eye. Sofia dropped onto her feet rubbing her face.



“I think I could take you,” Brian said, reading his stance. Sofia and Brian circled each other ready to strike until Sofia's phone beeped.



“Shit I'm gonna be late.” She grabbed her shoes and bag running out but not before some final words. “Just be honest with her ok.” Brian was afraid of doing that. Everyone took honesty differently. Brian's next class was in twenty minutes. He had no idea where Lisa was and he only had her in the project group chat so anything he said would be seen by the others. 



The sun set behind dome trees as Brian pushed his feet through the coble pathway leading from the theater room to a row of classes. Brian slurped from a half empty root beer can as he clang to his book bag. As Brian turned a corner he went for a three pointer. It was a straight shot as the can caught little air. Just before making it into the bin someone walked right in front. There was a pause as she stopped letting her eyes tell a deep emotion. It was Lisa. She was like a deer in headlights.  



“That…I…I was aiming for the bin.” Lisa relaxed a bit at his words. She threw her hair back without touching it as she clutched her books in her hands. 



“You really are an idiot aren't you?” Lisa’s words rang through Brian like a phone call he did not want to pick up. “I guess that makes two of us, you could have told me you had a girlfriend.” Brian picked up his empty drink, dropping it in the bin. 



‘You could have asked.” Lisa lifted her books on top of her head as she pulled her phone checking the time. 



“I have to get to class, let's talk later about our presentation,” Lisa said, as she walked backwards between two buildings. Brian quickly checked the time as he moved his feet across the grass. It was an honest mistake that Lisa made. It was a mistake anybody could make. Brian almost completely misread the situation. His mind couldn’t stop thinking of the interaction in class. How many other times has he missed out on something by being completely clueless. 



The night made its way into the world as Brian sat in his bed typing up a paper for one of his many classes. Sofia was doing almost the same across the room in her bed but Brian couldn’t be exactly sure. Sofia’s big bulky green headphones parted her red hair as sound quietly rang from them. Brian’s eyes laid on her as she sang quietly to herself focused on her screen. They were alone like they always were. Brian had not spent much time away from her. Brian opened another tab leading into a direct chat with Sofia. Brian just stared at the three little dots prompting him to send her a message. Would it be easier if he asked her through text or in person? Brian’s finger rested on the shift key until the sticky keys popped up. 



“Wanna get some food?” Her voice pulled his attention. Sofia pulled her headphones down as her typing slowed to a stop. Brian just closed his laptop. “We could just order something to the dorm.” Her words cleared his mind as he sat up. 



“With those delivery fees, how much money do you even have in your checkings?” Sofia scoffed at his words. 



“I’m so glad you think of me as some hussy blowing all the money mom and dad give us, relax Bri, Mac had another quit so my weekend will be full with his stories.” Brian just laid back in bed looking up at the ceiling. 



“I don’t know how that man puts up with you.” Brian’s words pulled a pillow to his face being thrown by Sofia. A silence filled the room as Sofia pulled her phone up. Brian knew exactly what he wanted to ask her. “How about Chinese?” 



It didn’t take long before they agreed and ordered their meal for the night. Another episode of Death Cop played in the background as the pair shared food off of each other's plate. 



Sheriff Mcaffey, frustrated as always, couldn't believe the reports coming in. It was looking like a double homicide with no luck of finding the killer. His desk was a mess of maps and empty coffee cups. One light flickering above added to the madness. Before Mcaffrey could really access his rage the door opened. It was defective Chuck Davis, the bright eyed blonde ruckie.



“It’s him again.” The words of Chuck Davis pulled the Sheriff from his office. Everyone was always uneasy around Death Cop but not Mcaffey. 



“Stop staring out the window, you're freaking people out,” Mcaffey said, as he poured himself another coffee. Standing in front of the large pane glass window was none other than the infamous Death Cop. His wraps hung off his body dragging on the floor. He turned as his crooked mouth fell open. He raised his cold dead lifeless hand as his finger pointed to the wall. “What exactly are you saying? I’ve been staring at this map all Goddamn day.” Mcaffey slammed his fist against the map on the wall. “We checked every street, every alley way, every rooftop.” Death Cop’s hand did not move. He just opened his mouth wider as bugs started crawling out. 



‘I think he’s trying to tell you something sir,” Davis said, as he plugged his nose to dodge the smell. 



“Are you saying I haven't checked everywhere?” Death cop just nodded to these words angering the sheriff. Mcaffey in an attempt to stop himself from breaking Death Cop’s arm just circled the room repeating all the places they had checked. His whispers became shouts as he screamed them into what ears Death Cop had left. Davis seemed to also be doing the same but only to himself. 



“The rooftops, the alleyways, the stores, the streets.” The sheriff's words rang in Davis’s ears until it sparked something. 



“The sewers!” As Davis shouted you could feel the change in Mcaffrey’s demeanor. 



“Davis grab Matthews, Death Cop your with me, I want officers knee deep in sludge looking for this prick,” The sheriff's words pulled everyone together as they left the building. Just like that the episode paused. Are you still watching flashed on the screen as Brian rubbed his eyes. Sofia collapsed in her bed with orange chicken sliding out of her mouth cause she had fallen asleep at some point during the thrilling show. Brian gathered what was left of their food and discarded it in a trash bin at the end of the hall.



Some days felt strangely long. Most days dragged on way too long especially when their days were filled with classes. Brian was taking stuff that just felt like a waste of time. His major was history. So why was an art class so important? Brian always felt like his hands were broken. Brian spent the good portion of an afternoon drawing a clown that looked more like a melting rock. 



“I don’t think it looks that bad.” Amber’s voice was coming though Brian’s phone as he had it propped up on his desk. Brian just leaned back in his chair listening to her sweet voice. “I have to get on stage, I'll call you after.” And with that her voice was gone. Brian was left to stare at his sad rock all by himself. It’s said art makes people feel things but all Brian was feeling was emptiness. 



“I’ll call you tomorrow with the plans.” Sofia’s voice followed her inside the door. Brian shifted in his chair as she hung up the phone. There was silence until there wasn’t. “Cool rocket ship.” Brian felt like pulling his hair out. 



“It’s a sad clown,” Brian said, leaning his chair back as it rested on his desk. Sofia leaned over him eyeing the painting. 



“Maybe it looks weird because it’s runny.” Brian just ignored her words as she set her stuff down. Brian watched as she made her bed before laying in it. “You remember what tomorrow is don’t you?” How could he forget it was the day of his history presentation. Brian stayed quiet as she lowered her phone. There was an intense stare that formed between them. 



“Arbor day?” Brian almost fell out of his chair as his words got a pillow thrown at him. “You really think I would forget your birthday.” Sofia just sat quietly smiling as she scrolled through her phone. Brian leaned back in his chair as words dragged across the ceiling in his mind. “I didn't get you anything though so don't expect anything.” 



“You're such a tease,” Sofia said, as she grabbed Brian's legs tilting him back more in his chair. Brain flailed for his life only for Sofia to put him down. 



“It's official, as an adult I've peed myself.” Brian's somber words followed him out the door as he grabbed a change of clothes and his shower supplies. 



Sofia watched him leave as she laid back in bed. Her mind began to settle only for her restless brain to spring her out of bed. Her fingers danced over his laptop as the screensaver showed random tourist destinations. Sofia picked up Death Cop issue number five glancing over the thin penciled art before her eyes landed on the unmarked diary. Hanging down the side was a ribbon bookmark. Sofia pried the book open as she took refuge in Brian's chair. 



She was something else. A friend, maybe more. It’s not like I could tell her let alone anyone. I think I knew I was different. He just pretends that everything is normal. I guess that's what brothers are for. But what am I for? 



Sofia’s mind latched onto each word as she pulled meaning from the words. The truth in the pages was hidden between the words. Brian made himself known as he tossed a towel over Sofia. 



“Don’t move my bookmark.” Brian’s words fell on deaf ears as Sofia pulled a question out of thin air. 



“You didn’t tell me she was gay.” Brian laid down in bed turning to her. 



“Who’s gay?” Sofia shifted as her eyes pounced on him. Sofia tapped the book lightly. “I mean I haven’t read that far in yet.” Sofia rolled her eyes as she set the book down. 



“What do you think happens at the end of this book?” This was a question that Brian did not want to think about. “What do you think would happen if I googled this book?” Sofia pulled Brian’s laptop off of his desk. 



“No!” Brian lightly shouted as he closed the screen. There was a pause of silence as Brian took the laptop from her. “I want to finish the book, if the book ends without me knowing the real ending I don’t care.” 



“So you're not at all curious what happens to her?” Brian clenched the laptop tight as his body shook. 



“I have to believe everything is ok.” His words were on the edge of tears. Sofia said nothing more and just pulled the laptop from his arms as she hugged him. It didn’t take long for bad thoughts to rise in Brian. His mind was on the cusp of a question he fought himself to ask Sofia. “Can I ask you something?” Sofia just held him tighter. She stayed in silence letting his question fade as she was too afraid of what it was. 



“The girls are waiting for me at the club,” Sofia said, as she pulled herself away from Brian. Brian pulled himself together as best he could. Brian just watched as she gathered herself together. Brian just watched her leave as he gently pulled his blanket over himself. Brian fell asleep in his bed as the sun said goodbye. 



The night came and went as the sun said hello. Brian checked his phone before noticing Sofia was still gone. Her bed was neatly made relaxing Brian. Brian folded his blanket making his space copy her's as the door opened to her presence. 



“Good morning,” Sofia said, with a bright smile. Brian shifted on his feet as he pulled up his phone. A song blasted as his feet shuffled back and forth. Sofia launched forward as she bent backwards, throwing her arms up. An upbeat disco song filled the room as the pair shook themselves to the music. They both looked like it was their first time ever dancing but that didn't stop them from enjoying the moment. Brian's robot could use some work while Sofia’s macarena was almost spot on. Their hands joined as Brian spun her around the room. As Sofia gathered her footing she grabbed Brain in a hug from behind. 



“Happy birthday.” Brian's words added to the smile on her face as they just held each other. The happiness had to fade by some degree as classes were starting up. The couple had to split as the day got busy. Sofia couldn't help but hear happy birthday everywhere she went. Brian could barely focus in his classes. His mind was split between Amber and Sofia like it was most days. When the day slowed down Sofia called Brian to the parking lot. Brian moved between cars as Sofia’s red hair guided him. 



“They're almost here!” Sofia jumped on her feet with excitement as she screamed. Brian just tried to hold her still. The couple turned as a honk got their attention. Sitting at the end of the street just outside the parking lot was a big red truck. Sofia dragged Brian through the pavement covered in white lines as the door’s of the truck opened. Standing at the driver side of the car was a big burly man with receding brown hair and a mustache dressed in casual business attire. And standing at the passenger side of the car was a plump woman with short red hair dressed in a purple dress. 



“Happy birthday!” Their words synced as Sofia circled the car hugging both of them. Brian just stood in silence as he watched Sofia hug her parents. “Brian get over here,” Janet said as she opened her arms wide. Brian dragged himself to her arms as she embraced him. “Oh you're so thin, is Sofia feeding you?”



“I don’t need her to take care of me,” Brian said, scoffing as he pulled away. 



“You sure about that?” Maxie asked, as she loomed over everyone from the sidewalk. She was dressed as proper as ever with a dark purple suit and her red hair up in a bun. 



“Oh look Harold all of our children are here,” Janet said, as her eyes filled with tears. 



“Great you’ve gone and made your mother cry, you know I have to drive home with that.” Harold's words came with spit that he shot onto the asphalt. Janet’s eyes narrowed on her husband before the happiness took back over. “Brian how’s school?” Brian shifted his focus away from the hugging girls as Harold set his sights on him. 



“I’m doing well I guess,” Brian said, as he scratched his head. 



“Sofia tells us you're seeing someone,” Harold said, patting Brian's back. Janet made the loudest audible noise she could as she turned on her feet. 



“Oooh when should I be expecting a grandchild?” Janet grabbed Brian's hands as she begged for his answer. Brian froze in place trying to think of what to say. 



“Mom, stop pestering him.” Sofia's words along with her hands tried to pry Janet off Brian. The air became still as everyone relax their words. Janet just stood dazed in a dream about the future as Sofia tried to get her attention. 



“Anyway we can’t stay for long,” Harold said, with a bright smile on his face. 



“But Dad, what about going out for dinner?” Sofia pleaded with Harold as best she could but he would not budge. 



“You know I’ve got work in the morning, anyway does this campus have a place to lock up bikes like a garage or something?” Sofia looked at her dad confused. 



“Yeah Dad we have a storage room near the west wing.” Maxie also seemed a bit confused as she answered her father’s question. 



“Great Brian help me with this will you.” Brian didn’t hesitate to follow Harold to the back of his truck. Harold lowered the tailgate as Brian hopped into the back of the truck. Standing in the back of the truck was a red Schwinn bicycle with a storage rack on the back. Brian ran his hands over the frame as his eyes sparked a memory. 



“Is that what I think it is?” Sofia asked, as she walked around the car. 



“It’s your bike.” Brian couldn’t hold back a smile as he turned to Sofia with his words. 



“Daddy, you fixed our bike!” Sofia shouted as she jumped into Harold’s arms. While the back of the truck filled with excitement Maxie and Janet were speaking in hushed tones. 



“Have you been watching the news?” Janet just ignored her daughter as she looked off into space. “His hearing is coming up.” Janet seemed to be visibly shaking. “Mom.” 



“Do they know?” Janet asked, as she turned, watching Brian and Sofia unload the bike. Maxie just looked away.



“I don't know.” Janet grabbed Maxie's arm gripping her sleeve. 



“Then don't tell them, let them be free.” Maxie shook her mom free. There was more she wanted to add but Janet was pleading with her cold worried eyes. Sofia was already riding up and down the street on her bike. 



“Brian get on!” Brian followed Sofia's words as he sat sideways on the rack as his feet dangled next to the tire. Once the bike was balanced they took off down the road. Brian felt the wind pull on his hair as he tried to stay steady. Brian couldn't help but remember a different time he sat on the back of this bike. “Are you thinking about the levee?!” Sofia shouted through the wind to her companion. 



“That's where we left this bike!” Brian shouted back as they pulled to a stop. Brian grabbed Sofia as he was almost rocked off the bike. 



“Dad, you pulled this bike from the levee.” Sofia's words were direct and Harold couldn't deny the facts.



“Went back that night actually, you kids loved this bike so much, well I just couldn't let her go.” Sofia cut off his words as she hugged him again. Brain slid off the bike holding it up. “We can’t stay forever, honey we have to hit the road, Brian make sure you take care of my daughter, Maxie you take care of your siblings.” Harold dished out his last words before climbing into his truck. Janet gave everyone a final last hug as Harold hung out the window. “Brain catch!” Harold tossed Brian a big u-shaped bike lock. “The code is L-O-V!” 



“Take care kids, I'll miss you all!” Janet yelled as she waved out the window. The remaining three just stood in awkward silence. Brian pulled the bike onto the curb. 



“Happy birthday dear sister,” Maxie said, as she performed a curtsy. 



“Why thank you, will you be joining us for drinks?” Maxie tapped her face thinking to herself. 



“As much as I would like too, I have work, you two take care.” Maxie split in the opposite direction as Brian and Sofia headed for the bike storage room. 



The wind kept the air chill as students moved between buildings. Brian and Sofia took their time heading back to their room. Sofia was lost in thought. She had an obvious question that she was hesitant to ask. 



“Hey Bri.” Brian pushed her away as she tried to get his attention. His face looked like he was about to implode. 



“Don't touch me, I have to use the bathroom,” Brian said, as he started waddling down the hall. Sofia just rolled her eyes as she headed for their room. Sofia changed her clothes into something more flashy consisting of a sparkly tank top and loose fitting shorts with a sparkly belt. Sofia wasn't sure how long it would be before Brian returned so she picked up the unmarked diary and flipped through it. 



I lost it. On the bus maybe. I asked Steven to help me look for it. He just seems to be lost in his own mind. He doesn't care about what's going on with me. I'm not even sure what's going on with me. 



Today I tried to grab his attention. We were left alone. I just wanted to spend time with him. It feels like he wants nothing to do with me. Am I that much of a…



Sofia flipped the book closed on the desk as Brian walked in. Brian's focus was on his phone. He just sat on his bed texting Amber. Sofia let her eyes dance over him. 



“Do I annoy you?” Sofia's question pulled up Brian's head.



“What?” Brian didn't quite hear her question.



“Do I annoy you?” Puzzled, Brain quickly stood up tossing his phone on his bed. 



“Yeah you do, I think we should get new roommates.” Brian's sarcasm angered her a bit as she slapped his arm. “Relax, I'm joking, you could never annoy me, now we have a birthday to celebrate, so get out so I can change.” Sofia left the room quietly as she thought about his words. It didn't take long before Brian pulled on a new outfit consisting of black jeans and a plaid button up shirt. 



A short bus right landed the pair in front of Missy’s pub. Brian opened the door for Sofia as they entered. The bar was still setting up with chairs upside down on tables. 



“Hey hey, happy birthday.” The pair turned as Mac gave his wishes. His smile was bright enough to light up a room or light his beard on fire. “Sit anywhere you like, you two hungry?” Brian and Sofia sat at the bar as Mac moved into the back to prepare some hot fries. “Doing anything crazy today?!” 



“Nah just a night out with friends!” Sofia leaned over the bar as she yelled through the small window to the kitchen. Sofia couldn't help herself as she reached behind the bar grabbing a couple glasses. Brian smacked her hand angry at her behavior. 



“You know the setup, pour yourself something!” Mac’s voice roared over the fryers as Sofia gave Brian a smug look. Sofia moved around the counter as she tossed up a mean mixed drink. Vodka mixed with clear soda, the juice of a spicy pepper, and a lime made the almost glowing drink Sofia slid in front of Brian. Brian tapped his glass as the water wiggled in its container. 



“Down the hatch.” Brian followed her words as they both downed their drinks. Sofia happily licked her lips as the aftertaste kept her lips warm. Brian on the other hand was almost gagging trying to get it down. “Alright I'm awake.” Brian did not feel awake like Sofia. As Sofia poured another drink Brian kindly declined. “You're no fun,” Sofia said, as she took a swig. 



“And you're drinking too early.” Brian jumped off the stool stretching his legs as hot fries hit the table. Mac seemed eager to please. Mac seemed like something was on his mind. Sofia, unaware of Mac's worried expression dug into her fries only to spit them out as they burned her tongue. Sofia downed a glass of water as Mac just watched her. Brian was afraid of what was about to happen.



“Sofia you know Dug just quit.” Mac's words turned her face sour. Sofia turned away not wanting to face him. “I know it's your birthday, but could you give me an hour just to do the dishes.” Before Brian could step in Sofia flipped around.



“One hour, I'm inviting everyone I know, I'm not leaving the bar.” Her words were stern with her eyes glaring at him. 



“You're a lifesaver, tell you what we can lock up early and you get the place to yourself.” Sofia started to like this idea. Brian only smelled trouble. Brian just lifted a fry to his mouth blowing on it before eating it. Brian's eyes darted to Sofia as she pulled out her pack from her jacket pocket. Brian's eyes went wide as she pulled a cigarette to her mouth. Before Brian could get any words out Mac grabbed her arm. “What the fuck do you think your doing?” Mac's voice sent chills through her body. Brian just sat frozen as Sofia fumbled with her lighter. Mac's eyes told a story of sadness and pain. 



“My mistake,” Sofia said, quietly as she slipped off the stool. Brain cut through the tension in the room as he followed her outside. Sofia was shaking off her fear as she rubbed her wrist. 



“Are you ok?” Brian grabbed her arm making sure it was ok as he tried to comfort her. 



“Fuck! I didn't mean to, shit I'm an asshole.” Brian just rubbed her back until the door opened. Mac stood there hiding half his face behind the door. “Fuck Mac I'm sorry I wasn't thinking.” Mac just opened the door as he grabbed her arm making sure he didn't hurt her.



“Shit, no I'm sorry are you ok, I shouldn't have grabbed you like that.” Mac hung his head as he leaned on the door. The small amount of redness on her wrist was already fading. Brian's appetite for a smoke quickly faded. “I boxed up your fries.” 



“Thanks we will be back tonight,” Sofia said, as she spoke through a cigarette. Brian swiped the fries from Mac. Mac just waved goodbye as the pair left heading down the street. Sofia couldn't shake the fear running down her spine. No one likes being yelled at even if it's a mistake. As they stopped at a red light, Brain made sure to rub her back. Sofia shook off his comfort and swiped the fries from him. Sofia’s mood quickly changed as the tastes of salt and spuds filled her appetite. 



The pair pulled themselves out of the rays of the sun as a familiar pub came into view. The brick walls gave Brian a good memory. The darkness of the place brought all attention to the stage where soft words echoed from. Amber was shifting her body back and forth as she hugged the mic. Her words were bold and loud as she sang through pauses following Kitty’s drums. Rudy let her notes follow through everything behind Amber’s solf guitar playing. Brian and Sofia sat quietly in the front watching and listening. 



“I can’t understand what you want, it’s freaking me out cause I’ve gone, circles in my head spacing out, thinking of what this is all about.” The drums looped into a fast motion as the guitar soon followed with an upbeat suffer rock sound. Amber set down the mic as she picked up her bass. The piano followed the rhythm with a simple back and fourth of notes. All the girls whistled a tune that harmonized with the music until the song slowed to a stop. “Hello everybody I'm Am and this is Ber and together we are the Ambers!” Amber and Amber held each other as six or so claps filled between the voices. “We would like to dedicate our last song to Sofia, happy birthday girl!” Brian shook Sofia as Amber pointed to her. The last song was a familiar one. A song Brian didn't mind hearing again and again. It was getting close to six as the group all sat around a table celebrating.



“Pause, explain it again?” Rudy asked, as she reached over the table grabbing chips. Sofia was explaining the complexities of her few relationships. 



“Like there's much to talk about, it's so hard to keep a woman when you live with a man.” Sofia was excitedly drinking through her words. “People are so insecure.” 



“Have you always lived with Brian?” Amber's question sparked a quick response. Brian wasn't internally lying to Amber. There were just some things he found difficult to speak out loud. Brian jumped to his feet ready to answer the question but Sofia pulled him into a headlock.



“Brian here is my brother.” Sofia's words came with a ruffle of his hair. Brian fought for his freedom as everyone at the table laughed. The environment stayed fun and playful as everyone moved onto their feet. Sofia couldn’t help but make a social media post inviting everyone she could back to Missy’s. Brian scoffed as he saw the post. A quick van ride away got them back in the clutches of Mac. Sofia stood behind the bar mixing drinks while Amber, Kitty, Rudy, and Sphinx sat at the bar engaged in conversation. Brian sat quietly in the back of the room sipping a light beer as Amber comforted him. 



“She always has to be the center of attention, is that rude to say on her birthday?” Amber gripped Brian’s arm listening to him. “Sometimes I just think it’s tough to he heard around her.” Amber gently kissed his cheek.



“I hear you, but you dude need to make yourself heard.” Brian almost scoffed at her words. 



“Look who's talking.” Brian ruffled her hair as he looked into her eyes. 



“Then I’m the perfect person to tell you that.” Amber pulled his head close. “Just focus on me ok.” As the pair began examining each other's faces in the dark Sofia was busy sharing her attention. 



‘I haven't think I’ve been here before.” Sphinx said, as his arm was being clutched tight by Kitty. Mac was in the back scrubbing away at the dishes. “Why is it called Missy’s?” Sofia got quiet as Mac pulled himself from the sink. His ears seemed to perk up. 



“I bought this place for my wife,” Mac said, as he cleaned a glass with a rag. The group let their eyes dance around the room. Pictures apon pictures of locals were scattered along the walls. One picture stood out. A picture of a beautiful blonde woman hung above the bar. Her frame was covered in hearts. Mac watched carefully as Sofia took a quick shot of gin and vodka. “Hey slow down, you're still on my time.” Sofia’s eyes glared at him as he just looked at her with worried eyes. “Let's close up in thirty.” Sofia relaxed herself as people were still coming into the bar. Sofia poured drinks for strangers, friends, and everything in between. Finally when Mac locked the doors Brain pulled Sofia into his dark corner of the bar. Not everyone could stay long. Amber and Amber were what was left as Mac leaned on the bar sipping his scotch. 



“This place should have a stage!” Amber yelled leaning over her chair. Mac just grinned as he scratched his beard. As she turned Brian noticed a fresh tattoo on her arm. 



“Hey new tat?” Sofia asked as she leaned on the table. Amber perked up showing off her arm. Each arm had a couple small tattoos on them. Right in the center of her left arm was a skull with a purple bow. “Do you have any tattoos Amber?” Amber pulled her head off of Brian. 



“Naw I’m a bit afraid of getting one, what if I hate it after I get it,” Amber said, as she pulled up her sleeves. Brain slid his hand over her arm until he grabbed her hand. 



“Eww you two are gross.” Sofia couldn’t hold back her drunkish distaste. Brian just nudged her as he held Amber. 



“Someone is jelly,’ Amber said, as she downed her drink. Amber’s eyes locked on Sofia as she watched her through the bottom of her glass. Sofia crawled onto the table letting beer drip from her lips.



“Maybe I am, why don’t you figure out how jelly I am.” Amber just closed her eyes and flashed a gentle smile. 



“I’m flattered but I don’t like women.” Amber’s words sank Sofia’s head to the table. Drunken spit dribbled out of her mouth. Mac seemed ready to close up shop completely. Brian forced some water down Sofia’s throat before getting her on her feet and out the door. Sofa waddled forward on her legs as they moved to the van. Sofia leaned her hand on the van as she caught her breath. 



‘Are you gonna throw up?” Brian asked, as he made sure she was ok. Sofia just shook her head letting it dangle in the open air. Brian contemplated his life as he pulled Sofia’s arm around his shoulder. As Brian pulled his foot off the curb and into the van a voice pulled his attention. Both Ambers turned looking out the front windshield as they watched a bright light coming through the darkness. 



“Brian!” The flash of a phone lit up the van as someone grabbed Brian’s arm. “Brian Fader!” Sofia jolted her head up as the light blinded her. 



“I wasn’t driving officer.” Sofa’s words slurred out as Brian looked on confused. 



“Brian Fader.” Brian could not see the person behind the light. He could only hear his voice. It was like Brian was seeing stars as he turned away. 



“Yes I’m Brian Fader, who are you? And why do you have this bright light in my face?” Amber opened the passenger side door trying to figure out what was going on. 



“Brian are you gonna be at the hearing?” The stranger held his phone close to Brian’s face. Sofia began swiping at the phone. 



“Hearing?” Brian didn’t know how to react. His brain took a minute to click. Brian’s senses went into overdrive as he stumbled to hold up Sofia.



“The hearing for your parents murder, will you be at attention? Are you gonna speak on behalf of keeping him locked up?” The doors of the van slammed as the girls exited it. Brian’s head was spinning as he was trying to figure out what to say. That's when a voice took over the street. 



“Hey! Get the fuck out of his face! Hows about I smash that phone of yours!” Mac charged out the bar holding a bat. Too much was happening at once. Bran fell back as Sofia slipped out of his grasp. Sofia latched onto the stranger as she headbutted his face. Everything went quiet as he fell back grabbing his nose. 



“You bitch I think you broke my nose!” Sofia just started uncontrollably laughing as the guy ran off. Mac walked over with a sigh of relief. 



“Everyone alright?” Brian reassured him that they were fine and thanked him before climbing into the van. The ride through the dark streets was quiet besides Sofia's snoring. The feeling in the car was full of questions and only Brian had answers. 



“I wasn’t keeping it from you, I just don’t like to talk about it.” The girls stayed quiet just listening. The street lights flashed through the windows as Brian continued. “It was a burglary gone wrong, I wasn’t home at the time, he went away for the murder of my Mom and Dad, Sofia’s family adopted me afterwards.” The girls didn’t know what to say. As they pulled up to the campus Brian pulled Sofia to her feet trying to wake her up as best he could. 



“Do you need help with her?” Amber asked, as she leaned out the window. Amber helped stable Sofia as they carried her to their room. Brian couldn't exactly see Amber but he could hear her. “I was disowned by my parents when I didn't want to go to college.” Brian just listened as they dragged Sofia up stairs. “If you ever need to talk I'd love to listen.” Brian fumbled out his key to unlock his door. Sofia was dropped in her bed as the pair stood in awkward silence. 



“I wasn't hiding it from you.” Amber quelled Brian's worry as she placed a finger over his lips shutting him up. Amber just held him. They stood in comfort as Sofia squirmed in her bed. “You should go, I'll miss you.” Amber pulled her lips close as they kissed. Brian watched her leave as he hung in the doorway. Once she was out of sight Brian closed the door. 



“No mister, I'm not a clown.” Brian watched Sofia talk through a vivid dream. Brian reached into his pocket and pulled out a small green frog keychain. Brian set the keychain down on Sofia's side table before dragging himself to his bed and turning off the lights. As Brian pulled up the covers his eyes shifted following her voice. “Brian!” 



“Yes?” It was unclear if she was in a dream or not. 



“I almost forgot, how was your presentation?” Her voice was soft and sleepy. 



“It went fine.” Sofia said nothing more and Brain just listened as her snoring began.

1g1mgro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1g1mgro/spouse_is_spending_a_lot_of_time_with_their_ex/,"Spouse is spending a lot of time with their ex, trying to be supportive but insecurity is getting best of me. ","Hi there, not sure if this is the correct sub reddit but unsure where else to turn. My partner (both 30s) has been spending a lot of time with her on again, off again ex. They have a pretty complex relationship, where she was madly in love/pining for him, while he was always dismissive and wanting to get away as soon as they got together. Recently, within the last year, soon before our relationship began, they seem to just be friends. I've been trying to be supportive of their friendship but I think sometimes my paranoia and insecurity can get the best of me.

Their hangs are pretty normal, she cat sits for him, they go out drinking or for morning coffee. She disappears for awhile and I can't reach her, but I always chalked this up to ADHD as that's just kinda her way, like when she's at work and such. She's always been accommodating of my insecurity and has tried to normalize as best she can, like inviting me out to their hangs. Idk, I don't want to be friends with my partners ex, and I think that's pretty normal. The guy is always awkward and uncomfortable around me anyway, and he told her when we first started dating that he was jealous of our relationship.

Recently, while she's usually given me a heads up beforehand, they've been going out for coffee without any mention of it. Tomorrow they're going out to go brewery hopping in the early afternoon, and I'm just uncomfortable with day drinking in general even though she invited me. We already made prior plans for that night where we were gonna host dinner for some friends of ours, and idk I feel like her coming home drunk is going to affect the night. Like it's pretty normal to be offended if your partner makes plans to go out day drinking with their ex before you're hosting dinner right? Idk. 

Am I being paranoid/unkind? I haven't voiced any of these concerns recently, but feel like my insecurity is reaching a breaking point. Any support or advice would be welcome.",0,1728687389.0,Infidelity,30,0.5,False
