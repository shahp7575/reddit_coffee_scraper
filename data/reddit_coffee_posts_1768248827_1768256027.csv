Some of my friends are telling me I should get also an infant carseat that will snap into my Uppababy cruz v3 because I'll want that for short trips, carrying into the grocery, or carrying in and taking baby into a coffee shop etc. To me, carrying a carseat and a baby would be pretty hard, and Im hoping I can baby wear for these instances!

  
I had planned just getting the bassinet to use with the stroller to avoid buying another carseat. Does anyone else do this and find it to work?

I recently got a K Ultra grinder which I'm still getting used to but really liking for certain coffees, and have been using an Orea Z1 for zero bypass/ easy consistent brewing and travel.

After reading a bunch on here about flat bottom brewers I decided to go for the Timemore B75- in the past I've brewed a lot of natural ethiopians with more fines, and have always been annoyed by clogging, and the B75 seems the fastest/most clog resistant. I got an extra pack of the Timemore filters with it, but opinion here seems to be split on whether they're preferred over regular Kalita filters, so I'll probably try both eventually.

I would love to hear people's go-to recipes and filter choices, and if anyone uses either the ZP6 or K Ultra then I'd love your grind settings as well. I'm also interested in what sort of coffees you prefer the B75 for over the V60 if you regularly use both. 

I'm guessing I'll use the B75/K Ultra for when I'm going for more body/fullness and sweetness, which so far for me has been more medium roast chocolate-y coffees or alternatively processed/co-ferments, and I'll stick with the ZP6/V60 for the high clarity/ brightness profile of washed or more traditional light roasts, but open to any and all thoughts!",1,1768255826.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Around 10–15 years ago I read a women’s romance novel in German, and I’ve been trying to find it ever since.

The story is about a woman who suffers from memory loss, I believe after an accident. Her husband picks her up from the hospital and takes her home. Once there, she is surprised by her own life: a handsome husband, a beautiful house, expensive designer clothes in her wardrobe — everything is very clean, modern, and perfect.

At some point, another man appears and tells her that she and he had been having an affair. She doesn’t believe him at first. Later, she ends up in his apartment and notices many things that clearly belong to her — including her favorite coffee mug.

It turns out that every time she visited him, she planted a sunflower seed on his balcony, and the entire balcony is eventually full of sunflowers.

1qb8yur,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_healthy_relaxation/comments/1qb8yur/daily_mindfulness_practices_simple_ways_to_boost/,Daily Mindfulness Practices: Simple Ways to Boost Focus and Well-Being,"# Daily Mindfulness Practices: Simple Ways to Boost Focus and Well-Being

**Daily mindfulness** **practices** are simple, practical ways to improve focus and support well-being without adding to your schedule. Below you’ll find easy techniques you can use anytime, including mindful breathing, mindful eating, body-scan meditation, walking meditation, gratitude journaling, single-tasking, loving-kindness meditation, mindful movement, the five-senses exercise, and mindful listening.

# Mindful Breathing

Mindful breathing is about hitting pause on everything else and focusing on your own breath. **Carving out even five minutes for this practice each day can help you sort through racing thoughts and ground your attention.** It’s not about breathing differently, just noticing how it feels to breathe in and out.

You might be surprised by how tricky it is to keep your mind focused on your breathing. The good news: if your thoughts wander (work, dinner, that awkward conversation from yesterday), you simply bring your attention back to your breath. That’s it. No judgment, no big deal.

Here’s a quick way I usually do it:

1. Sit or lie comfortably. You don’t need any special gear, just a place that feels okay.
2. Breathe in through your nose, feeling your chest or belly rise. Count to three if it helps.
3. Breathe slowly out through your mouth. Notice the air leaving.
4. If your thoughts pop up (they will), gently notice them and return your focus to your breath.
5. Repeat for a few cycles or as long as you like.

Honestly, this is something you can do almost anywhere: while sitting at your desk, waiting in line for coffee, or standing in the shower. Don’t worry about doing it “perfectly.”

# Mindful Eating

https://preview.redd.it/kbrub7z7szcg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c82f3fecbf2a769d12b6eeb051a9800966b4a6f4

Ever catch yourself polishing off an entire bag of chips without even tasting them? Yeah, most of us have been there. Mindful eating is about noticing what you’re putting in your mouth instead of going through the motions on autopilot. **This practice helps you enjoy your food more and can even change your whole relationship with eating**.

Here’s what it often looks like in practice:

* Sit down with your meal and remove any distractions (yes, that means putting your phone away and turning off the TV).
* Take a moment to notice the sight, smell, and even the sound your food makes. Let your senses take it all in before you begin.
* Eat slowly. Set your fork or spoon down between bites and pay attention to the flavors and textures as you chew.
* Check in with yourself as you eat. Are you full, still hungry, or somewhere in between?

|**Habit**|**Mindless Eating**|**Mindful Eating**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Distractions|TV, scrolling, work|No screens, quiet space|
|Speed|Rushed, barely tasting|Slow, savoring each bite|
|Attention to hunger|Ignored|Checked before/during meal|
|Awareness of satisfaction|Overeat or undereat|Stop when satisfied|

>

It’s not about strict rules or only eating certain foods; it’s more about being fully present with your food, one bite at a time.

# Body Scan Meditation

[Body scan](https://healthyrelaxation.com/meditation-body-scan-script/) meditation is a straightforward way to tune into your body and check how you’re feeling, both physically and mentally. **It’s not about trying to fix or judge what you find, but about noticing each sensation, one at a time.** This practice can help you reconnect with your body, and even a few minutes can make a noticeable difference in how tense or distracted you feel, according to recent studies on [body scan meditation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12411690/).

Here’s how you can do it yourself:

1. Find a quiet spot where you won’t be disturbed, either lying down or sitting in a comfy chair.
2. Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Pause for a moment and take a few deep breaths.
3. Start at your toes. Notice whatever comes up, such as warmth, tingling, pressure, or maybe nothing at all.
4. Slowly shift your focus up your body: feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips… then through your abdomen, chest, and shoulders.
5. Bring attention to your arms and hands, then up to your neck and face, and finally to the top of your head.
6. If your mind drifts off (which happens to everyone), gently bring it back to whichever body part you last remember.
7. When you finish, take one more breath and notice how your body feels as a whole before standing up.

* You might notice areas of tension you didn’t realize were present until now.
* Some folks feel calmer afterward, even if their minds wander a bit.
* It can be helpful to set a timer for 5 or 10 minutes so you don’t have to worry about time.

# Walking Meditation

Walking meditation is a simple way to bring mindfulness into your daily routine, whether you’re out for a stroll or just moving through your house. **This practice is about paying close attention to the sensation of each step.** Forget about rushing to your next task. Just pick a spot where you can walk, even if it’s a small hallway or your backyard, and start slowly.

Here’s how to make the most of your walking meditation:

1. Before you begin, stand still and take a moment to feel the ground beneath your feet.
2. Set an intention to notice each step and each shift in your weight.
3. Walk at a gentle pace. Try to keep your attention on how your feet touch the floor, the movement in your legs, or the sway of your arms.
4. If your mind drifts, as it always does, gently guide it back to the experience of walking.
5. Repeat for a few minutes or as long as you can.

Walking meditation does more than sharpen your focus. Research shows, [meditative walking](https://wisemanhealth.com/the-power-of-walking-meditation/) is linked to improved mood, better sleep quality, and even supports brain health.

>

# Gratitude Journaling

[Gratitude journaling](https://healthyrelaxation.com/journaling-for-self-care/) means setting aside a few minutes each day to put your attention on what’s actually good in your life, even when some days make that harder than others. **Taking time to list what you’re thankful for gives your brain a new track to run on, shifting from complaints or stress to a bit of appreciation.** It isn’t about pretending everything is perfect; it’s more about making space for little bits of good, even in small details.

Here’s how to get started with gratitude journaling:

1. Grab a notebook you can keep nearby, or use a digital notes app if that feels easier.
2. Each day, write down three specific things you’re thankful for. Be as specific as possible, think “the barista who smiled at me” rather than just “coffee.”
3. Do this at the same time every day, such as before bed or with your morning coffee. Consistency is what makes it stick.
4. If you want, jot down how these things made you feel, or take a moment to reflect on why they matter.

Try this simple daily table to stay on track:

|**Date**|**Thing #1**|**Thing #2**|**Thing #3**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10/7/2025|Warm socks|A call from Dad|Good book|
|10/8/2025|Breezy weather|Lunch with Sam|No traffic|

# Single-Tasking

Let’s be honest, multitasking sounds good on paper, like answering emails while cooking dinner, texting during meetings, and flipping between a dozen browser tabs. But how much do we really get done? Usually, I end up half-finishing everything and feeling way more frazzled than when I started. **Single-tasking is the practice of doing one thing at a time, giving it your full attention, and refusing to split your focus.** It’s surprising how big an impact such a small change can have on both your clarity and mood.

Here’s one straightforward way to practice single-tasking every day:

1. Choose one task, just one. It could be typing a report, folding laundry, or even savoring your coffee.
2. Silence your phone. Turn off notifications or put it in another room.
3. Set a timer for 10 or 20 minutes, whichever you prefer. Tell yourself, “I’ll focus only on this until the timer goes off.”
4. When your mind wanders (and it probably will), gently refocus your attention on the task at hand.

If you get distracted anyway, don’t beat yourself up. Just start the timer again. I used to think multitasking was a badge of honor, but after switching to single-tasking, work feels less overwhelming, and I make fewer mistakes. Focusing on one thing at a time, as mentioned in [making small changes in daily routines](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/parenting-from-a-neuroscience-perspective/202510/how-to-stay-mindful-in-an-increasingly), can be the quickest way to restore a bit of calm when life feels chaotic.

>

Try these quick tips to make single-tasking stick:

* Take short breaks after each session to avoid burnout.
* Keep a notepad nearby to jot down intrusive thoughts (so you can return to them later).
* Notice how your focus and productivity change over a week of this practice.

When you replace multitasking with this small, mindful step, you might find you get more done in less time. The best part? You’ll likely feel better, too.

# Loving-Kindness Meditation

Loving-kindness meditation, sometimes called “metta” meditation, gives you a way to bring more generosity and care into your daily routine. **The basic idea is to quietly offer kind wishes to yourself and others, using simple, silently repeated phrases.** It can feel awkward at first, but stick with it: over time, you might notice real changes in how you relate to yourself and the people around you.

Here’s a straightforward way to begin practicing loving-kindness meditation each day:

1. Settle into a relaxed and alert position. You could be sitting or even lying down. Whatever works, just be sure it’s somewhere you won’t be easily interrupted.
2. Close your eyes or lower your gaze. Take a few deep breaths, letting your shoulders drop.
3. Bring yourself to mind. You might use quiet phrases like, “May I be calm. May I be safe. May I be healthy.” Don’t worry if it feels a bit corny. The point is the intention, not perfection.
4. Next, imagine someone close to you, maybe a friend or family member. Direct those same kind wishes to them: “May you be calm. May you be safe. May you be healthy.”
5. Try the same thing with a neutral person (maybe the barista you see each morning), then, if you’re ready, with someone you find a bit tricky. This can be tough, but it’s part of loosening up old gripes.
6. To finish, see if you can send those wishes out to your wider community or even to everyone everywhere.

The thing I like about this meditation is that you don’t need any fancy gear or extra time; it can be as simple as a couple of minutes before bed or first thing when you wake up, just like many people do as part of their [morning meditation routine](https://healthyrelaxation.com/morning-meditation-rituals-to-start-your-day-calm/).

>

# Mindful Movement

Mindful movement is about tuning in to your body as you move, whatever that movement looks like. Yoga, stretching, or even everyday activities like getting out of bed can become a mindful practice if you pay close attention to your body’s signals and sensations. **Instead of going through the motions on autopilot, mindful movement invites you to slow down and notice what’s happening inside and outside of you.**

Here’s how you can begin practicing mindful movement in your routine:

* Pick any simple movement: walking, stretching, or traditional exercises such as tai chi.
* As you begin, bring your attention to how your body feels. Notice the pressure of your feet on the ground, your muscles working, and your breath moving in and out.
* Whenever your thoughts start to wander, gently remind yourself to refocus on your body. No judgment if you get distracted; just a gentle return to the present.
* Try to synchronize your breathing with your movements. For example, inhale when you lift or stretch, and exhale when you release or lower your body.

Some people like to use mindful movement to start or end their day. Others use it when they need a mental reset. There are no rules about duration. Sometimes a few minutes is all it takes to feel more grounded.

>

# Five Senses Exercise

The Five Senses Exercise is a quick, practical way to ground yourself in the present moment when you’re feeling scattered, anxious, or simply lost in thought. **You engage each of your senses, noticing what’s actually happening around you rather than what’s swirling in your head.** It’s simple enough to do anywhere, whether you’re stuck in traffic, waiting in line for coffee, or just needing a break at your desk. Here’s how it works:

1. **Look for five things you can see.** Maybe it’s the color of your mug, the pattern in your socks, or a crack in the sidewalk you usually ignore.
2. **Notice four things you can feel.** Pay attention to the chair beneath you, the way your clothes touch your skin, a draft against your arm, or even the hair brushing your forehead.
3. **Find three things you can hear.** Let yourself actually listen. Maybe it’s the ticking of a clock, distant voices, or the hum of air conditioning.
4. **Seek out two things you can smell.** Sometimes this one feels tricky, but try anyway: the scent of coffee, a book’s dusty paper, or even nearby fresh laundry.
5. **Notice one thing you can taste.** Chew a piece of gum, sip water, or just pay attention to the taste already in your mouth.

This whole thing can take less than two minutes, or you can stretch it out if you want. What matters is that you use your senses to reconnect with right now, gently setting worries aside for a bit. If you want to ground yourself even more, spending time in nature, like taking a walk and focusing on the details around you, can really help with mindfulness, as mentioned in [sensory grounding exercises](https://healthyrelaxation.com/stop-overthinking/).

# Mindful Listening

https://preview.redd.it/x1nfrlk5szcg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=6983bb1d7ad7dfe647012354fd8e4ebeeb4d6941

Mindful listening isn’t just about staying silent and nodding along; it’s the art of giving your full attention when someone else is speaking. **Most of us spend a lot of time thinking about what we’ll say next, but really listening is surprisingly hard.** Phones buzz, thoughts wander, and before you know it, you’ve missed half the conversation.

Here’s how to practice mindful listening day-to-day:

1. Put away distractions. Silence your phone or close your laptop.
2. Focus on the speaker, not just their words but also their tone, pace, and even their face.
3. Hold off on judgments or responses until they’re finished, even if it means sitting through some silences.
4. Notice your own reactions. Did your attention drift? Are you impatient or eager to reply? Gently guide yourself back if you catch your mind wandering.

There’s something powerful about feeling genuinely heard. Try setting an intention to listen with kindness and patience, especially in tense conversations. If you’re curious about how mindfulness can strengthen relationships, you can read more about the role of [present-focused meetings and thoughtful responses](https://healthyrelaxation.com/mindfulness-stress-relief/) in lowering stress and improving communication.

>

Practicing mindful listening makes everyday conversations deeper, and it’s a simple way to bring mindfulness into your daily routine. Give it a shot with the next person you talk to. It feels different, lighter, slower, and more real.

1qb8ybq,https://i.redd.it/26fefb58szcg1.jpeg,Coffee prices in findom,"Alright so I think this is a crucial topic as funny as it sounds😭. But let me just get started:

The price of coffee is how I determine how expensive someone is. And honestly through the years the price increases in coffee have been mind blowing.

The fed (within the US) uses metrics such as labor job reports, inflation index, consumer price index, etc. 

Now when looking at findom, it defies all type of logic. This is a biased stat but I see coffee being valued anywhere between $15-$20 now, the most I’ve seen being $27. Which makes NO SENSE considering that coffee is selling at $3.75 same as it was a year ago. However the prices between last year and now feel drastically different. 

This makes me question what the hell dictates this coffee prices. And for those who have $20+ coffees where the hell are you getting them from?

1qb8xx1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qb8xx1,1 year difference : Jan 2025- Jan 2026," 1 year difference

Like the title says: 1 year difference. 

Idk what it is, but every couple or so years my skin BREAKS out but this time I feel like I finally got it under control omg. 6-7months before Jan 2024, so around June - July was when it started getting so bad out of nowhere . It was crazy. I kept doing different at home remedies and different kind of products I seen at target/ross/tj max/ etc because I thought it was an immediate fix. Nope I was wrong. It was the type of acne that became cystic and it hurt to touch 😭

So I then got put on doxycycline 100mg 1 @ night for 30 days and I started this end of November. Instead of 30 days, I ended up doing it until March 2025. Besides Doxycycline, the topical paired it with was Epiduo FORTE. Before I was given just Epiduo and it hit different vs Epiduo Forte. I only do Epiduo Forte at night. That stuff is like crack for my skin. I then started doing Azelaic Acid in the morning end of February. 

I also want to add I was in the Philippines for several months in 2025 so I took advantage of the skin clinics there. I got the following facials & lasers for my face:
- Anti Acne Facial (Feb / March)
- Pico Carbon Facial + Brightening Facial (April)
- Carbon Laser Facial (May/June)

Now I’m back in the states. I don’t have time for a facial but the one thing I do now good enough either once a week or every 2 weeks is lactic acid. I get it from 2 places. If I’m down to spend , I get it from Clarity RX it’s about $62. But if I’m on budget I get it from The Ordinary. Avoid the sun & the gym next day (sweating /sun.) 

Soooo the following products I use at the moment : 
Morning 
1) Facial Wash Daily Cleanser w/ cold water 
2) followed by drying and applying Azelaic Acid 3) Olay Complete daily moisturizer w/ SPF 15 

Evening : 
1) Facial Wash Daily Cleanser w/cold water , then wash a 2nd time with Cetaphil’s Extra Gentle Daily Scrub normal to oily skin 
2) Pat dry and then apply moisturizing cream 
3) Apply epiduo forte (I have to apply moisturizer before hand because epiduo is drying af) 

Extras
1) I never use makeup wipes EVER. It doesn’t remove the makeup. Use a cleanser 
2) Never sleep unless I wash my face
3) I switch from drinking coffee to tea w/ honey. I have found out drinking lots of coffee esp with sugar makes my skin worse
4) Gua Sha. Ever time I am in the process of washing my face, I also massage it with cold water. I don’t need any equipment , I just need my hands. 
5) If facials were as affordable as they are in the Philippines, I’d do it every month in the states. I will stick to lactic acid lol. 
6) I was my makeup brush about 2-4x a month. Use dish soap to actually clean it thoroughly.  

Remember what may work for me, may not work for you. I have a combo of dry-oily skin! So I worked what products worked best with this. ",2,1768255736.0,AcneScars,1,1.0,False

I’m Paul, I’m 35 from the UK. I ended a 7 year relationship in October 2025 so I’m not looking for anything serious any time soon, but I’d love to find some fun connections and hopefully build a real friendship. Potentially leading to more one day, but without putting any pressure on it. I travel a lot and like learning about new cultures so I’m open to people from anywhere.

I am self employed and successful running my own online marketing agency and having a few smaller side businesses. I’m also into fitness, i love running and am doing my first ultra this year, I go to the gym 5x a week and enjoy yoga and boxing.

Outside of fitness I’m into reading, history, nature, animals, coffee, cooking, good conversation, fashion, skincare, sci fi, gardening, video games.

I’m quite aggressively socialist and left wing - I’m open to people of any belief or background and enjoy debating deep topics but don’t come at me if you’re bigoted, racist, mosogynist, Zionist, or any of those kind of vibes. I don’t care about your age as long as we’re not too dissimilar to connect. 

I’m 6ft 1, with browny red hair and brown eyes, if that matters at all. Happy to share pictures.

Would love to hear from you ",1,1768255642.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

So a few months back I bought a Chemex, the wife didn't like the coffee it created so I bought a V60 for myself instead of using a Chemex each time.  I have been trying different beans trying to get a nice sweet flavoursome brew and as expected am failing miserably. 

Beans I have tried so far:

* Kenya Peaberry Kisii Estate
* Guatemala Los Volcanes Todos Santos
* Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Dumerso Natural
* Ugandan Kalingwe
* Monsoon Malabar 

I have a Kingrinder K6, my starting point is 95 clicks and with the Ugandan Kalingwe, 15g, at around 94-96c I get a nice brew that seems sweet and I enjoy drinking it.  Everything else on the other hand I don't get the same.  

The technique I am using at the moment is 50ml wait for 40s, then around every 20 sec add 50ml until I get to 250ml.  Total brew time is usually around 3m 15-30s.

I have tried 10 clicks (at multiple points) either side of 95, I have tried temps from 90 -> 96c and still I get a tasteless brew missing sweetness and flavour, at the extremes I do get into the bitter/sour.

Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong, whilst I do enjoy the Ugandan Kalingwe I was really hoping to be able to get the same bright sweet flavour from other coffee but I am failing miserably.

This happened to me TWICE same night yesterday at Zamna Black Coffee. once at entry once at bathrooms. 

On the way in i got shaken down at bag search for a literal tylenol in my bag. Armed police takes from bag search, takes me to scan my ticket and get my wristband, and THEN takes me to a dark tent room pulls my pants down, fingers inside underwear, literally squat and cough, looking for drugs. Asks how much money im gonna give him to get my f*n tylenol back and pulls cash out of my wallet. 

He says “look youre not going into the party tonight if you dont give me money and your drogas” - I just keep telling him no lol and i dont have anything. Literally never in my life has this happened and pure irony im the last person they will find a whisper on as i am stone cold sober of years. He didnt end up taking my money, and let me in. 

Then i go in and have a pretty OK time… takes me a while to bounce back from that. But nothing special at all - i go to the bathroom pee for 5 seconds then get straight up profiled AGAIN by ARMED cops who do the same thing in front of all these people at the port o poties. 

Again i had nothing and told them i wont give them any of my money and good luck finding anything. Literally pulls my shorts down in public lol. Apparently this happens to guys alone here without women. 100% worst nightlife experience ever and will never come back to tulum. 

No encounters with cartel but what a bs thing to put attendees through from local law enforcement at your event.

1qb8rs5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qb8rs5,PSA: All Sage (Breville) coffee grinders (e.g. Grinder Pro/Barista etc) contain an internal felt washer that WILL shred itself. Sage (Breville) will sell you a new one for ~UK £10 / US$12 inc. shipping...or you can make it yourself for ~1p / 2 US cents. [SAGE/BREVILLE GRINDER PRO],"***TLDR: To replace the felt washer in a Sage (Breville) Grinder Pro (or any similar Sage/Breville machine with a grinder in it) buy some makup remover cotton pads for £0.69 from Lidls (or anywhere else) and cut 2 of them with scissors or box cutter into the right shape to replace the felt washer using the metal washers to eyeball the right size. Job done.***

**LONG VERSION:**

I cleaned my Sage (Breville) Grinder Pro and found a felt washer at the bottom of the grinder which had been shredded into bits (see pic). It's so fragile that I imagine this will have happened to every machine more than, say, a couple of years old.

The washer's purpose is not obvious - perhaps to absorb oils & block coffee grounds to prevent them from getting into the motor, or maybe, as Sage say, to reduce vibrations and ""ensure equal loading"" (whatever that means in the context of a soft washer made of felt!...)

Anyway, SAGE wanted about £10 inc. shipping for what is essentially a teeny tiny micro strip of fabric (not even a multipack!)........................so they can get stuffed.

I read some people just take the washer out and have no issues, but presumably it's there for a reason so I wanted to jimmy my own replacement, if possible.

I briefly considered buying a felt sheet & cutting then gluing or sewing it into the right shape, but even easier seemed to be to get a 140 pack of cotton makeup remover pads for £0.69 from Lidl, so that's what I did. I stacked 2 of them together & used a box cutter and a pair of scissors to cut them into a ring of roughly the right shape. I just eyeballed it but you can measure it if you want. The internal hole of the fabric washer should be about the same size as the two washers at the bottom of the grinder and the ring should be about 3mm wide. It doesn't matter if you get it wrong as you can just repeat it as often as needed and it doesn't need to be a perfectly round circle & you can kind of squidge it gently into place. Hard to explain but if you look at the pics you'll get the idea of what I mean. Plus I included a photo of my dinner (bonus points for anyone who notices this).

I was happy with my first attempt so total cost for this was under 1p which is about 0.1% of the cost of the Brevill OEM part, \*plus\* I now have 68 spares for future repairs, for which Sage would have charged \~ £400/$500(!)

PS To get at the felt washer is not that difficult, you unplug the machine, take out the hopper & remove the upper burr, remove the smooth headed bolt (it turns the opposite way to normal to undo i.e. it's a left handed thread) and the 2 x metal washers underneath & then you have to pull out the lower burr, the impeller beneath it and two metal washers beneath the impeller, using tweezers - or just turn the machine upside down, put it over a bucket and gently shake everything out - ideally not over the sink in case something goes down the plug!. The felt washer is then right at the bottom. Give the machine a good clean with a cloth or similar and run a vacuum hose in there, and perhaps use some kind of brush to clean off the burrs.

Reassembly is even easier - just the reverse. You only need to finger tighten the top screw as it'll tighten up in use anyway. There are some youtube videos if you want to see this process in action.

**And Thence the Dragons Came**

There were dragons high up in the Snowy Mountains, and then there weren’t.



Sorry to disappoint.







**Prologue**

Not everyone was cut out for the decapitatorial sciences, what with the long hours, the shadeless town squares, and the whole executioners-wearing-hoods thing apparently being a myth. But Garumund Executionerson was quite suited for the role – even if that suit didn't include a hood.



“He’s got the name, ain’t he?” said Headsman Dickory, pulling on the string of his stuffy ceremonial cloak. “Telltale sign of He Who Shall Place the Head of the Dark One Over a Wooden Block and Strike Him Down With the Great Axe is having the requisite name.”



Standing around him were numerous other cloaked men holding lit torches and pointy axes. They, too, pulled on strings. The kind of strings that secret societies huddled in damp basements of old churches tended to pull – which was all of them.



One of the cloaked men, Headsman Byron, scratched his head as he struggled to read out the words written on the tattered scroll. “No, no, there’s one of them thingies here. What do you call it . . .?”



“A smudge?” asked Headsman Dickory.



“No, not a smudge.”



“A stain?” shouted a shrill voice from the back.



“Not a stain.”



“An apostrophe,” said Headsman Hargrave, bringing his torch closer to see. “It says there is to be an executioner’s son who saves the realm from evil and such things. Doesn’t specify which one.”



Headsman Dickory furrowed his brow. “Dunno. Looks an awful lot like a smudge to me.”



“Supposing it’s not,” reasoned Headsman Byron, “if it can be any old son of an executioner, why can’t any of us do it? Executionering’s been in my family for over three generations.”



“Been in mine for four,” added Headsman Dickory.



There was a long, ceremonial pause.



“Because, brothers, there is always more to consider.” Head Headsman Mann snatched the scroll from Headsman Byron and pushed his way up to the lectern at the front of the room. “We must ensure that we identify the most correct Chosen One in strict accordance with the Code.”



He looked over to the foggy display case beside him. There it lay: the Magical Code of Regulations in all its codified glory. Big, beautiful, bureaucratic, bound.

And damp. Always damp down in the basement.



It was so damp that simply turning a stuck page was one of the three trials one needed to pass for admittance into the Order. It was so damp that it was hard to tell who’d just come up from the basement, and who’d always been a bit wet behind the ears.



“How do you know I’m not the most correct Chosen One?” asked Headsman Byron.



Head Headsman Mann pinched the bridge of his narrowed nose and exhaled deeply. It wasn’t hard to tell how wet Headsman Byron’s ears were; they’d gone over this many times before to no avail. “Egh. Have you passed any trials?”



“Trials? No.”



“Do you bear any identifying marks or scars as per § 702.5(b)(1)(D)?”



“I have a weird freckle!” exclaimed another headsman.



“Have any of you survived any falls from a great distance; endured direct magical blasts that would otherwise cripple you; come away unscathed from prolonged exposure to necrotic atmospheres?”



The other headsmen looked around, shaking their heads.



“No, no, don’t fink so,” said Headsman Byron.



“That is how I know,” said Head Headsman Mann. “Candidates must meet each and every requirement as laid out in the Code, and it is my belief that Mr. Executionerson does.”



Headsman Hargrave raised his hand. “So, what now? We just walk up to him and say, ‘hi, how do you do, you're the Chosen One, here's an illegible scroll and a rusty axe, good luck, godspeed, now go kill that child and hope we're right about ya, chop chop?’”



“Yeah, I fink that’d work,” said Headsman Byron.



“Sounds pretty reasonable to me,” said a third cloaked figure.



Headsman Dickory continued pulling on his string. “He only lives about three blocks away from me nan. Could pick him up on my next holy milk run to the store.”



“Yeah, I’ve heard about holy milk,” said Headsman Byron. “They says it can make anything it touches all holy-like. Heard one fellow say he poured it on his axe, and now it cuts through things like a proper holy-like axe should.”



Headsman Dickory paused. “Think we could pour holy milk on the Great Axe, and make it holier? Might not matter who wields it if it’s holier.”



“No one will be pouring anything on the Great Axe,” said Head Headsman Mann. “It shall remain as it has always been, untouched and unsullied by lesser executioners until such time as Mr. Executionerson – or another who is deemed worthy enough – presents themselves.”



“What about the people that brought it here?” asked Headsman Byron.



“What?”



“The people that brought it here. They touched it.”



“He’s right,” said Headsman Dickory. “Wasn't wearing no cleric's gloves or nothing.”



 “And we had it mounted up on that wall right there just last month,” added Headsman Hargrave. “Don’t fink any of them was wearing gloves.”



Head Headsman Mann sighed. “Regardless, no one is—”



“Wasn’t Headsman Black playing with it the other day in the sacristy?” asked Headsman Dickory.



“Hey, was not!” said Headsman Black. “That was Headsman Horace, and he was in the courtyard chopping wood with it.”



“Hey!”



“E-nough!” shouted Head Headsman Mann. The room grew dark and silent – even for a damp basement in an old church. “From here on out, no one is to touch the Great Axe until such time as we are absolutely certain of the most correct Chosen One’s identity. A matter of such importance cannot be left up to chance – especially now, with so many watchful eyes about.”



Headsman Dickory tugged on his string once more, pulling it all the way through. “Can’t we just go back to the old ways? Been a few hundred years since our last Gauntlet.”



“The Gauntlet!” chanted the others in unison, placing their axes over their hearts. “Accippire camut!”



“Et occacide corpus, brothers,” said Head Headsman Mann, lowering his axe as the others followed. “Fret not, Headsman Dickory, for the old ways are alive and well inside of the Code. If an amendment to our sacred text was passed, removing the use of the Gauntlet—”



“The Gauntlet!”



“—then it must follow that it was because His will intended such.”



Head Headsman Mann placed the scroll back into its gold ornate box, and put it on the mantel behind him. Looming over it and all else was a large portrait of the venerable Randel Cromwell, the inaugural Head of the Order of Headless Men and eventual Minister of the Ministry of Prophetic Affairs – both of whose divine missions were now tasked to Head Headsman Mann.



He took a few moments to appreciate the portrait as per secret societal bylaw, then turned to Headsman Hargrave. “Brother, prepare Form 3828. This matter shall be settled as all others are nowadays: with a threatening letterhead and a thick seal of threatening wax.”



The other cloaked men collectively sighed, grumbled, and pouted. And for good reason, too: the Gauntlet would’ve been really cool.



Headsman Hargrave nodded, then headed off.



“Oh, and pick up some whole milk while you’re out. The cellar is running low.”







**Chapter 1: Go Back and Read the Prologue**

Students from all over Cathartia dreamed of attending the prestigious K. Rolfe Institute of Arcanic Studies. It had excellent dormitories, a world-renowned magical research program, and it was the number one party school in the realm three years running.



Just down the street, Horner University stood barely on its last legs, raised up high on stilts to stop all the ruckus from getting in. Its school of magic was more akin to a nursery for magic, and its idea of a party was more conceptual in nature. The real pride of Horner was its School of Decapitatorial Sciences, led by esteemed department head Dr. Garumund Executionerson.



Like his father before him, Garumund had been a professional in the field for over three decades. When curious graduate students had questions about the temporal rate of change of the phase argument of a sinusoidal waveform when striking between the second and third cervical vertebrae with a bifacial impact-delivery apparatus, it was him they came to. When they had questions about what would be covered on the next exam, they went to the syllabus.1

On the third morning of the eighth month, Garumund sat by the window in his office, penning his treatise on contemporary wooden block design. This was it. This was going to be revolutionary. This was going to be his masterpiece. This would be his monument to—



“Hi. Hello. Sorry, don’t mean to interrupt.”



Garumund turned to see a slender man standing timidly in the doorway. “Then don’t.”



“But sir, I come bearing an urgent message.”



“Spit it out, then. If it’s so urgent, you don’t have all day.”



The man cleared his throat. “Esteemed scholar Miles Masters Borowitz will not be able to attend class today due to unforeseen circumstances which are too private in nature to discuss further. Please excuse him from all assignments, and especially, er . . .”



“Examinations?” Garumund asked pointedly.



The man unfurled a piece of parchment, and began to read. “Examinations that may or may not take place on this day. Thank you, and be sure to really emphasize the thank you.”



Garumund exhaled deeply. “Tell Mr. Borowitz—”



“Sorry, no can do, sir” said the man. “I'm under strict orders to run away before you can properly respond. Something about plausible infertility and whatnot. So, if you’ll allow . . .?”



“Go,” said Garumund, shooing the man away. “But if Mr. Borowitz thinks his little antics will save him from his responsibilities, they’ll need to design an exceptionally blocky block for his head!”



After waiting a few moments for the man to leave, Garumund closed the door and resumed his writing, moving to a nearby desk for comfort's sake – not Garumund’s comfort, but the parchment’s, which was enchanted and which was prone to fits of pointed grammatical errors and gross mispellings when not given a moment or two to lie flat and rest.



Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.



“What is it now?” he muttered, placing his pen down and getting up from his desk. “Office hours are posted on the door!”



He threw the door open, and as he did, a portly stack of envelopes floated down to his feet like a rock, which meant that where it had been was nestled between his door and his door frame like an unwanted takeout menu looking for a warm place to stay for the night – and Garumund didn’t take well to uninvited guests.



Standing out amongst the crowd were two envelopes in particular:



The first envelope was from the National Headsman Society. Garumund had recently been invited to become a member of theirs – just as he had been every few months for the last thirty or so years. He was considered a perfect fit for their mission, which was to extract as much money as possible from their members through recurring membership fees that were so high as to be an annoyance, but not so high as to be worth the effort to cancel. Eventually, he’d joined in hopes that the letters would stop pouring in, but they’d persisted nonetheless. Trash. Burn. Burn again.



The second envelope was from the Ministry of Prophetic Affairs, as indicated by the large, threatening letterhead situated in the top left corner on the front, and the big, red, threatening wax seal fastened to its rear. Garumund recoiled, then regained his composure.



He opened the envelope, and began to read. “Dear Mr. Executionerson . . . as part of our duties . . . you’ve been summonsed . . . a Great Axe . . . evil and such things . . . within one fortnight.”



Garumund sighed, then placed the letter down. He’d worked with the Ministry numerous times in the past – executing such figures as the Pale King, the Unseen, the Lost Heir, the Dread Knight, and the Doombringer2 – and while he generally liked the work, he’d heard rumours of the new regent’s love of pageantry and over-the-top nicknames. Decapitation was a science; it was a means to inform; it was dignified. What it wasn’t was some foolish sideshow meant to entertain the fanatics in the splash zone below.



Besides, if he was out there, fulfilling prophecies, who was going to be in here, finishing his treatise? It wouldn’t finish itself – and neither would the footnotes, who were already threatening to unionize as it was.



But the ability to decline a prophetic summons was more of a technicality than anything. According to the Code, one of the telltale signs that a Chosen One was in fact the Chosen One for a given prophecy was a general reluctance or philosophical angst upon discovering their prophetic origin. Declining would only further cement their status as the man (or amorphous blob of ambiguity) for the job – plus, it required a lot more paperwork.



Garumund folded the letter in half, then placed it in his desk drawer. He had a couple of weeks to respond, so there was no real rush. The world wouldn’t end for another fourteen days.



1 Common topics listed on Garumund’s syllabi included blood spatter analysis, grindstone operation and maintenance, anatomical applications of strike theory, non-communication with nobles, and alchemical engineering.

2 Officially referred hereinafter as Antagonistic Entities of Prophetic Significance (A.E.P.S.) #14, 23, 45, 47, and 56, respectively, in accordance with § 702.5(b)(4).



**Chapter 2: Bridge Club**

Wherever there was smoke in Cathartia, one could be reasonably certain that Constable Blackwood was hiding right around the corner with bellows in one hand and a half-hearted justification in the other. In his younger days, he could burn a few huts, elicit a harrowing cry or two, go for a short walk, plant some incriminating evidence, and still make it home in time for supper. But these days, his battles took place over warm tea, at a small wooden table situated inside the cramped Lower Upper Council Chamber.3 Here, sharp axes were exchanged for piercing looks, insults replaced catapults, and lily-livered lords took on the mantle of harder men. Instead of throwing torches, Constable Blackwood’s job was to now pass them.



“The Minister of War? Captain Gherhart is a drunkard that couldn’t tell a battle plan from a tavern menu. He’s not fit for the position!”



Sitting across from him at the head of the table was Prince Owyn, who commanded the room with the sort of authority that could only be inherited. He smiled as he looked around the table expectantly, eyeing the other lords.



“I think he’s a wonderful pick,” said Lord Frederic, who had the murine appearance of a man genetically engineered to agree with power. “A true friend to the crown indeed.”



“Yes,” said Lord Treston, huffing as he sat up in his wide chair, “he shall fit in quite nicely.”



The prince turned to Constable Blackwood. “Shall we put it to a vote, then?”



“I don’t think a vote will be necessary, Your Highness.”



Beside Constable Blackwood was a large stack of letters addressed to each of the prince’s candidates. The addresses were largely symbolic, as the royal carrier pigeons never bothered to read them anyway. He signed the one meant for the captain, and held it out for the pigeoner boy.



Even the boy would’ve been a better pick. At least he showed up when summonsed. Captain Gherhart was probably face-down in a brothel somewhere – and not a reputable one, either. Even the Busty Baroness was too chesty for the captain’s taste.



The pigeoner boy took the letter, and Constable Blackwood turned his attention back to the table.



“Now, for our next order of business,” said Lord Frederic, “the Minister of Prophetic Affairs.” He paused, then began paging through the agenda, his eyes narrowing.

“Is something wrong?” asked the prince, raising an eyebrow.



There was an even longer pause.



“Your Highness,” said Lord Treston, “historically, the position of Minister of Prophetic Affairs has been a politically independent one.”



“And?”



“And it’s a lifetime appointment,” said Constable Blackwood, leaning back in his chair with crossed arms and an even more crossed expression. “Tradition dictates—”



“I don’t care what tradition dictates, constable.” The prince stood from his chair, and walked over to a nearby window. “Traditions are empty gestures that halt progress and let dead men govern the living. If your only objection is the fact that it’s a lifetime appointment, know that lifetimes can be ended at any moment.”



He glared back at the constable with a fiery, threatening look.



Constable Blackwood knew very well just how quickly lifetimes could be ended. With how much the prince was frothing at the mouth when he’d heard his father’s illness had worsened, he was surprised the prince hadn't yet ordered one of his guards to streamline the process and make his position permanent.



“If I may, Your Highness,” said Lord Treston, “while I disagree with the constable’s . . . ill-mannered tone, I do believe it would be unwise to depose Minister Man. He has served the realm for almost forty years, and has done an admirable job at that. It may send the wrong message.”



“And what message is that, Lord Treston?” said the prince. “That the Ministry is above reproach? Executions used to mean something. They weren’t just punishments, but performances. And brutality? It wasn’t for the condemned, it was for the crowd. Those are traditions I can stand behind. Not this overregulated nonsense we’ve come to replace it with, where justice prioritizes red tape over red splatter, and chaos is allowed to fester.”



Constable Blackwood looked up through his eyebrows. “Rules and regulations aren’t only for preventing chaos, Your Highness – they can also be the very mechanism by which it is driven. A single comma can delay a coronation. The right footnote can deny a miracle. When wielded properly, regulations allow us to be extrajudicial without being unlawful.”



The prince looked back.



Constable Blackwood grabbed the inkpot beside him, and placed it in the center of the table. “You see red tape as a roadblock, Your Highness, but I see it as a bridge.”



He knocked over the inkpot, spilling it across the table and into every crevice it could reach out and get its hands on. “And bridges go both ways. Tear them down, and you may find yourself on the wrong side of the river with no law left to stand on but your own.”



The prince took a moment to gather his thoughts, dry them, place them into a mortar, grind them up into a fine powder with a pestle, pour boiling water over them, then let them soak in. “Clever use of props, constable. But let us leave bridge theory to the masons, shall we?”



Constable Blackwood went to reply, but instead held his tongue. The prince was many things – petulant, pompous, pithy, proper – but the one thing he was not was placable. Once his mind had been made up, it was difficult to try to change it without losing a frenulum or two.



“For the position of Minister of Prophetic Affairs,” said the prince, returning to his seat at the table, “I put forward the young Lord Dunning of House Dunning.”



Lord Frederic raised a glass of wine. “Yet another magnificent pick, Your Highness.”



“May he serve the realm dutifully,” said Lord Treston, plastering on a quick smile.



The prince looked to Constable Blackwood with an amused grin. “Shall I take your silence as a yes, constable?”



Constable Blackwood sighed. He’d never cared much for Lord Dunning. Behind his boyish charm and curly blond locks was a scoundrel more likely to drop his pants at the first sign of trouble than drop his axe. He was a coward and a fool, and his only experience in any sort of affairs was the one he was having with the prince’s sister. “That won’t be necessary, Your Highness,” he said flatly.



“Good. Prepare the letter.”



Constable Blackwood picked up his pen, and dipped it in the spilled ink.



The first beam of the bridge began to creak.



3 Not to be confused with the Upper Lower Council Chamber, which was seated higher in the castle, but didn’t wield nearly as much power in comparison.



**Chapter 3: Pastries, Pies, and Nans’ Stews**

Like bird watching, paint watching was best done dry. The difference, of course, was that when it wasn't dry, a bird at least had the decency to not stick around. Paint, on the other hand, was smug and stubborn and static and proud.



So proud.



In fact, it was this very pride that separated paint from your common laycoating. It knew it was meant to be admired – to be stared at, pondered over, argued about in galleries by people wearing puffy scarves on their necks and strong opinions on their sleeves. And once it was on the wall, paint would rather peel dramatically in forty years’ time than fade quietly into obscurity.



“Where is Headsman Byron?” whispered Head Headsman Mann, glancing around the room. “He should be here by now.”



“Saw him and Headsman Hargrave walking down to the basement earlier,” said Headsman Horace.



The basement? Gods know what those fools could be up to down there. Surely nothing good, or divine, or secret, or ceremonious, or covered under the terms of the lease.



“Well, they’d better be here soon. It’s important they’re here when the hour is up.”



Headsman Dickory furrowed his brow. “To watch paint dry?”



“It’s ceremonial paint. Its purpose is to be watched.”



“What’s my purpose?” asked Headsman Horace.



“Probably to do the watching, I imagine,” said Headsman Black.



“That is correct, brother. We are the watchers of the Weeping Wall. We are the guardians of its enduring dampness. We are the—”



“Why don't we ever get to do fun secret society stuff?” said Headsman Dickory. “Like summoning demons, or burning sigils. We only do the boring stuff. My friend down the street’s in a secret society as well, and they do potlucks on Thursdays.”



Head Headsman Mann rubbed his temples – not out of frustration, but habit. Headsman Dickory was a constant pain, yes. He was always asking questions, losing things – like answers to questions – and never seemed to quite catch on quick enough. But he showed up. He tried. And that was more than could be said for most. “Headsman Dickory,” he said softly, “it is precisely because it is boring that we must watch and protect the Weeping Wall. For boring things are the ones most in need of protecting. Things like law and order, and rules and regulations. Chaos may be exciting, but boring order is what protects the realm from utter destruction by nefarious forces.”



“Nefarious forces?” said Headsman Horace, worriedly.



“Yes, brother, yes. Nefarious forces. Ever-present Evil all around us, all the time.”



“Even in the sacristy?” asked Headsman Black.



“Especially in the sacristy.”



There was a long pause.



“Be a lot more fun if I could have a pastry or two’s all I’m saying,” said Headsman Dickory. “Not right they get potlucks and whatnot and we don’t.”

Head Headsman Mann clenched his jaw tightly. “We can have a potluck next week if you just be quiet!”



The  room went silent.



“Should I bring hors d'oeuvres?”



Head Headsman Mann scowled at Headsman Dickory. “What?”



“Hors d'oeuvres. Can't have a potluck without hors d'oeuvres.”



“Yes, fine, whatever. Now, if we could get back to the ceremony—”



“I can bring stew!” shouted another cloaked figure. “Been cooking in my grandmother's cauldron for three generations.”



“And we can't forget the pie!”



Head Headsman Mann said nothing.



What was there to even say? There would be no potluck.



There’d be no pastries, or hors d'oeuvres, or pies, or stews. By sunrise, both the Order and the Ministry would be little more than a footnote, and he himself would likely be dragged out into the street and hanged for his failure to go along with it.



But what, if anything, was worth being hanged for if not Truth and Justice?



The paint hadn’t dried yet. And until it did, he would watch. They all would. Quietly. Dutifully. Because that was the rule. And the rules – however mocked, however soon to be ignored by those that didn’t understand their true purpose – still mattered.







**Chapter 4: On the Geometry of Mercy: An Analytical Framework for Cervical Load Distribution, Block Resonance, and Moral Optimization in Ritual Decapitation**

Garumund’s pen slipped across the paper as his carriage hit a large bump.



“Watch it!” he shouted. “It’s bad enough I have to pay for my own carriage as it is.”



He scribbled out what little he’d already written, and started over.



The bumps weren’t so bad. In fact, there was a non-zero chance that one could hit a bump in just the right manner that the pen would slip up and down and in circles and crosses and finish his treatise for him. Dot his j’s and cross his Q’s, in a sense. Life had a way of working itself out like that.



Really, it was the whole paying-for-his-own-carriage part he was peeved at. Throughout his many times as a Chosen One, he’d never once had to pony up for his own carriage to the job site. But the crown wanted to root out waste in an effort to save money – as if ridding the world from an Evil that would surely cause untold property damage and death didn’t pay for itself.



The carriage hit another bump.



“Gods damn it! Pay attention to the road!”



“Sorry,” said the coachman, looking back. “Roads ain’t maintained like they used to be.”



Garumund huffed. It had been a long few days of bumps, pen slips, crumpling up and throwing of papers, and the occasional hit, admonish for standing in the middle of the road, and run. And Garumund had had enough. He had a treatise to write, and getting the godsforsaken thing to write itself had proved difficult thus far. “What’s the circumference of your neck?”



“Excuse me?”



“What’s the circumference of your neck?” repeated Garumund.



The coachman chuckled nervously as he pulled up his collar. “Erm . . . why do you ask?”



“Why does anybody ask anything? If no one asked questions, there’d be no reason to know the answers, and if nobody knew the answers, there’d be no reason to ask any questions. Society would collapse under its own ignorance.”



The coachman blinked. An awkward silence lingered in the air until it died of exposure.



“It’s for research,” said Garumund. “I suppose you wouldn’t understand.”



No one ever did – not even his contemporaries. Point your average lay-executioner to the nearest round block, and he’d undoubtedly paint its surface with the blood of the squarest head he could find, with little regard for the safety or well-being or dignity of the person being guided to their Ascension. And it was for precisely this reason that Garumund’s work was so important. Like anything else, mercy could be studied, and observed, and refined – and if all that failed, it could be forced by way of sheer engineerial fortitude.



The carriage dragged on. And with it, so, too, did Garumund’s pen. It dragged past towns and villages, and mountains and mines. Eventually, it made its way to the tattered gates of First City, which wasn’t the ironic name for Cathartia’s second or third city, as most assumed, but for its first. It was the oldest and dirtiest and narrowest city. In fact, it was so narrow that only a carriage in a corset could squeeze through its gates – and that was only after you greased the hands of the guards to squeeze past them first.



Garumund would have to walk from here.









**Chapter 5: Regulation of Thermoregulatory
Manipulation in Shared Magical Dwellings**

Archmagus Harold woke up shivering.



It wasn’t the good kind of shiver. It wasn’t the invigorating, bracing shiver of a man standing on a mountaintop contemplating destiny. It was the domestic shiver. The sort of shiver that suggested someone had been tampering with the thermostat.



He slipped into a comfy robe and some slippers and plodded down the hallway of his newly-shared cottage. He’d recently rented out the spare bedroom to Archmagus Steve, as whispering to the winds and talking to the trees didn’t quite pay like it used to. But it was still his house, damn it, and he deserved to be comfortable in it.



He reached the thermostat, and immediately scowled. Sixty-four degrees? Have we been transported to the ice realm or something?!



He began to turn the dial.



“Oi! Whaddaya fink you’re doing?”



Archmagus Harold looked over his shoulder. Behind him was Archmagus Steve, who took a sip from his floating coffee mug.



“Changing the temperature,” said Archmagus Harold. “It’s too cold!”



“Not without a form, you’re not.”



“A form? I don’t need a— why would I need a form? It’s my house!”



“I know my rights,” said Archmagus Steve, crossing his arms. “Not right of you to always be trying to take away my rights and such. I’ll not stand for it any longer!”

Archmagus Harold furrowed his brow. “What in the hells are you talking about?”



Archmagus Steve snapped his fingers, and a monstrously large book appeared before him. A most awful book, truly dreadful. It looked awful, smelled awful, and most importantly, it read awful. It was, in Archmagus Harold’s eyes, the most evil, dreadful, awful book in existence. “The Magical Code of Regulations?”



“That’s right,” said Archmagus Steve. “§ 901.7(c)(1). Says here you must be the ‘Designated Thermal Authority’ if you want to go around making the place all stuffy-like. And you must fill out ‘Form 407-C.’”



“Let me see that!” Archmagus Harold snapped his fingers, and the book appeared before him. He began to scan the pages. Archmagus Steve was right. The bloody prick was right. Even a level-two mage was bound to be right once every blood moon. But how did he know to look in the Code? He wasn’t the Guild’s most luminous practitioner. He had to have had help.



“Where did you find this?” he asked. “Have you and Archmagus Tom been lurking around my library again?”



“No. I just talked to one of them lawyering types, yeah. Said you’d done me proper wrong. Said any more tinkering might entitle me to damages.”



Archmagus Harold’s ears perked up. “Er . . . damages?”



He pulled his hand back from the dial.







**Chapter 6: Knocking on Headsmen’s Door**

The hour was upon Head Headsman Mann at the stroke of Eyte-Aye-Em, but that didn’t mean he had to make things easy for the crown. As the knocks grew heavier and more impatient with each passing second, his eyes never once betrayed the Weeping Wall.



Obstruct. Delay. Resist. That was his mantra. That was his weapon. Slow them down just enough to stop them from royally screwing everything up. Time was a finite resource, and he’d bleed them of all the resources he could manage on his way out the door – time, shins, crotches, knees, time. They’d have to drag him out kicking and screaming and scratching and citing sections of the Code. He would not make it easy for them.



“Maintenance!” yelled a high voice from behind the door.



Head Headsman Mann remained as still as a wall.



“Maintenance!”



Knock, knock, knock.



Headsman Dickory pulled down his hood, which wasn’t a ceremonial hood, but a patchy, strangely oblong hood of his own creation. Lord Dunning hadn’t even taken his hallowed oaths yet, hadn’t even spoken the mystic words or learned the secret handshake or taken the consecrated sweepings out to the curb, and already the initiates were breaking even the most basic of Order bylaws.



“Can somebody answer that already?” shouted Headsman Dickory. “Echoing all sorts in my hood.”



Standing by the door, Headsman Black nodded, then grasped the large, steel sliding bolt holding it shut. The Sliding Bolt of Divine Servitude or something or another. No one ever quite seemed to remember that one, not even Head Headsman Mann.



“You will do no such thing! We are under no obligation to help them.”



“Main-te-nance!”



Headsman Black peered through the peephole at the figures outside, all three of them, he counted, he did. He could make out the middle one clearly, noting his shortness, his stoutness, his stubbly beard, and that he seemingly had a way about him that said he was there for the sort of business that was only funny to the morally depraved, like axe murderers, or tax examiners. “But it's just Paul, the maintenance guy,” he said innocently. “And he’s got two men with him. Looks like they’re hauling a . . . painting? A big fancy one wrapped in cloth with a gold frame sticking out. And there’s a cart carrying a stone head.""



“Conspirators,” replied Head Headsman Mann, “coming to defile everything we hold dear here, brother.”



“Not everything,” remarked Headsman Dickory. “Just a few paintings is all.”



“Just a few paintings?” said Head Headsman Mann. “Those few paintings will become just a few bulletins, which will become just a few temporary measures, which will become just a little housekeeping, and before you know it, law and order and the Order will cease to exist and if you don’t let go of that damn door . . .!” He snapped his head back and glared at Headsman Black, who released the Sliding Bolt of Eternal Devotion or whatever.



Headsman Dickory furrowed his brow a bit more than usual. “Paintings turning into bulletins? Like magic?”



“Didn’t know magic could do that,” said Headsman Black. “Guess that’s why they put you in charge, knowing all sorts about magic and such, huh?”



Head Headsman Mann paused. On one hand, how much damage could Lord Dunning really do with this lot? If asked to, say, forge an important document, they’d probably roll it up, march it down to the blacksmiths’ guild, feed it into the fire, then spend the rest of the day hammering away at ashes, convinced they’d done a good, honest day’s work. On the other hand, Lord Dunning didn’t need competence to do damage, only silence, and if he simply asked them to look away while someone else forged a document, they’d happily oblige. Looking away was already something they’d shown great enthusiasm for. Best to, er, err on the side of caution, he thought. “Yes, brothers, yes. I know all about the magics, and the sorceries, and—”



“And the witchcrafts?” asked Headsman Dickory.



“Yes, yes, and the witchcrafts. All the magics, all contained within the scripture, all within the Code. With it, you can wield enough power to take on even the most formidable of foes.”



“Like trolls?” asked Headsman Black.



“Precisely,” said Head Headsman Mann. “Trolls, giants, dragons, politicians. All the power you could ever want. And you do want to be powerful, don’t you, Headsman Black?”



“Mmm, yeah, I suppose that’d be nice,” he said flatly.



“You all want to be powerful, no?”



The other headsmen looked to each other and nodded and grunted in general agreement.



“Then remember your oaths, brothers. Do not open that door. The Code is your power, and those men seek to take it. Comply only as much as it demands and no more.”



Headsman Black pondered this all over for a very brief moment as he once again peered through the peephole. “I dunno,” he said, unconvinced. “Paul always seemed all right to me.”



Head Headsman Mann narrowed his beady, sunken eyes. “Well, I’m still your boss, so you have to listen to me!”



Headsman Black sighed and slammed the peephole shut.





***



Down far below the sacristy, in the deep recesses of the basement, where the Weeping Wall’s weeping burrowed through every crack and crevice in the hardwood floor above and dripped down to its final resting place, Headsman Hargrave waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.



“Did it work?” he asked, turning to Headsman Byron. “I can’t tell if it worked.”



“Are you sure he said to pick up some holy milk?”



“Heard it clear as day. He said, ‘pick up some holy milk while you’ – meaning I – ‘are out.’”



Headsman Byron looked at the half-empty milk jug in his hand, then at the Great Axe in front of him on the table. One could almost mistake his waning skepticism for not having any in the first place. “Well, all right, I guess.”



He continued pouring the milk on the Great Axe.

Forgive me for not knowing how to post an update, I'm from the 1900s... I'll edit after posting to add the link to the last post..

Per the suggestion of the LLC guy who commented on my original post I removed the master fluid, set it aside, then did a pretend double boiler (washrag in pot of water and sat the globe on that) slowly heated it until all the wax was melted, gave a few gentle but firm swirls to the bottle to try and reconstitute. Filtered the MF through a coffee filter to try and get a little more clarity. Put it back together and have been cycling for about a weekand a half.  

The only issue I have now is that... 

1) There is some sediment under the wax that didn't blend back in after my attempt to fix, do I need to redo my steps and remove the wax totally for some more vigorous mixing?

2) we are still hazy - will filtering remove any of the dye? I'd prefer it to be clear anyways or should I just replace the MF totally?

3) maybe egg yolks are your jam (no judgement) but I think it's ugly lol - if I dye the wax will it change the flow? If I want metallic wax do I just add mica powder ?

Any answers suggestions comments or concerns greatly appreciated -

Poppylands is full of 1940s nostalgia, with ration books, wartime posters, an Anderson shelter, Dad’s Army touches and shelves of memorabilia. It all started from Darren’s childhood collection and his grandfather’s medals, and inside it really does feel like stepping back in time. 

We sit down for food, including the “Captain Mainwaring” all day breakfast, a ham and cheese panini, lemon cake and some proper camp coffee. I also take you around the tearoom so you can see the details, from knitted tea cosies to the museum pieces and décor. It’s dog friendly, there’s outside seating, and you can book a table or afternoon tea in advance. As I go around, I also show a bit about the seating and general access. 

After Poppylands, we head over to the beach near California Cliffs for a short walk and an ice cream. Let’s just say the combination of sprinkles, chocolate sauce and melting ice cream turns into a very messy situation, but that’s real life as it hits me. 

If you like honest UK travel vlogs, days out, and seeing interesting, slightly quirky places around Norfolk, I hope you enjoy coming along.

It was a favor. A gap in the schedule. A “can you just cover two nights until we get someone up there?” kind of thing.

I said yes because I’ve been saying yes to the park in some form for most of my adult life, and because the tower makes sense to me. The routine. The lists. The way your world shrinks down to weather, visibility, and a radio that either works or it doesn’t.

The lookout was technically “decommissioned,” which sounds dramatic until you realize it just means the budget moved on. The stairs were still solid, the catwalk still intact, the windows still swept clean enough to see smoke. The radio still had power if you fed the generator and kept the battery topped off.

It was the kind of place you could pretend was abandoned while still being maintained, because nobody wanted to be the person who admitted they’d let it rot.

I got up there around late afternoon with a pack, a thermos, and a clipboard. The sun was low enough that it turned the treetops copper. From the cab you could see the whole back side of the park: ridgelines folding into each other, cut by long shadows and a few pale scars where lightning fires had burned years ago.

The tower creaked in the wind the way all towers do. Not dangerous creaking. Just the sound of wood and metal remembering they’re tall.

Inside, everything smelled like dust, pine pitch, and old coffee.

There was a laminated sheet tacked by the radios with three bullet points in bold.

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

If you are lost, stay put. Use emergency phones or 911. If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

Somebody had underlined the last line twice, hard enough to emboss the plastic.

I remember smirking at it when I first saw it. Not because it was funny, but because it was such a weird thing to have to write down. It felt like superstition in a workplace that runs on checklists.

I did my first call-in with dispatch. Gave them my location, weather read, and the fact I had a clear view of the southern ridge. They logged it, told me to call again at 2100, and that was that.

The first few hours were quiet.

I made coffee on a little camp stove. I filled out a logbook nobody reads unless something goes wrong. I watched the light fade. The forest below turned into one solid dark mass with only the service road cutting a faint line through it.

The tower radio for the lookout was an old handheld unit plugged into a charging cradle by the window. Someone had wrapped the antenna base with a band of black electrical tape, and the casing had a crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner, like it had been dropped on rock years ago and never repaired. The faceplate sticker was so sun-faded you could barely read it, but if you tilted it just right, you could make out the handwritten block letters: LOOKOUT 3.

Around 2030, the radio squelched and popped in a way that made my shoulders lift automatically. You don’t ignore that sound, not out there.

“Lookout Three, dispatch,” came the voice. “You copy?”

I pressed the transmit. “Copy. Go ahead.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again. “We got some weird traffic earlier. Not on our main. Just letting you know in case you hear it.”

I glanced at the laminated sheet by the radio.

“Define weird,” I said.

Dispatch sounded tired. Same operator I’d talked to a hundred times, the kind who can sound calm even when there’s a crash on the highway and someone’s screaming in the background.

“Unmonitored channel. Someone calling for ranger assistance. Using the word ‘lookout.’”

My stomach tightened a little. “Someone knows there’s a tower up here.”

“Yeah,” dispatch said. “Probably kids. Or someone with an old radio. You’re not to answer anything that isn’t us. If you hear it, log it. That’s all.”

I looked at the underlined line on the laminated sheet and felt my earlier smirk dry up.

“Copy,” I said. “I won’t engage.”

I meant it.

At 2100, I called dispatch with my update. Wind had picked up. Temperature dropping. Visibility still good.

“Copy,” dispatch said. “If you hear anything unusual, do not respond. Do not leave the tower. Rangers are already stretched thin.”

“Copy,” I repeated.

I remember looking at the stairs after that. The trapdoor that led down. The way the tower’s shadow cut across the catwalk in the moonlight. I remember thinking, for no logical reason, that it would be easy to step out and go down and check the perimeter, just to prove to myself nothing was out there.

I didn’t do it.

I locked the trapdoor like I always do in old structures, because it keeps the wind from rattling it. I set my flashlight beside the logbook. I sat in the chair by the window and listened to the tower creak.

At 2217, the radio squelched again, but this time it wasn’t dispatch.

Not a call sign. Not a proper prefix.

Just a soft click, then a voice, thin through static.

“Ranger…?”

I froze with my coffee halfway to my mouth.

I didn’t touch the transmit button.

The voice came again, a little clearer. “Ranger, I need help.”

It sounded like a man trying to keep panic down. Breathing too fast. Words clipped. The kind of voice you hear right before people do something stupid.

I stared at the radio like it was going to bite me.

The laminated sheet was right there in my peripheral vision. The underlined warning felt like it was aimed directly at me.

Do not respond.

I sat still.

The voice on the unmonitored channel tried again. “I’m on Trail Six, I think. I’m lost. I can’t find the pull-off. Ranger station, do you copy?”

Trail Six was on the back side. It wasn’t the busiest trail, but it wasn’t obscure. People wandered on it all the time thinking it was “easy.”

My thumb hovered over transmit, then stopped.

I told myself I could call dispatch. That’s the right move. Log it. Let someone with authority decide if it’s real.

I picked up the handset for the main dispatch channel.

Before I could key it, the unmonitored channel voice came again, lower now.

“I can hear you up there,” it said. “Please.”

My throat went dry.

You could hear the tower. The generator hum. The wind.

But “hear you up there” made it feel like there was a line between us that wasn’t radio at all.

I keyed dispatch.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three.”

“Go ahead,” dispatch said immediately, alert now.

“I’m receiving traffic on an unmonitored frequency. Caller claims lost on Trail Six. Says he can hear me up here.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again, quieter. “Do not engage. We’ll send a unit to check Trail Six access points. Stay in the tower. Confirm you’re secure.”

“I’m secure,” I said. “Trapdoor locked.”

“Copy,” dispatch said. “Do not leave. Do not respond.”

I set the handset down.

On the unmonitored channel, the man’s voice changed.

It went flat for a second, like the emotion dropped out.

Then it said, in my own voice, “Lookout Three, dispatch.”

I felt my stomach drop in a way I haven’t felt since I was a kid and a car spun out on ice right in front of me.

It wasn’t a perfect recording quality. It was radio-thin. But it was my cadence. My breath. The tiny throat-clear I do without thinking before I speak.

The radio clicked again, and my own voice repeated, “Go ahead.”

I didn’t move.

I didn’t even breathe right.

The unmonitored channel kept going like it was practicing.

“My location, weather read…”

It was pulling phrases out of context, stitching them together like a puppet.

I grabbed the lookout radio and turned the volume down until the speaker was barely audible. Not off. I couldn’t bring myself to turn it off. Off felt like it would be worse, like closing your eyes when you’re sure something is still there.

I wrote in the logbook with a shaking hand.

2217: Unmonitored traffic. Male voice. Trail Six. Mimicked my call sign and dispatch phrasing.

I underlined mimicked twice, hard enough the pen tore the paper.

The tower creaked.

Outside, the wind rose and fell.

Then I heard something that wasn’t radio at all.

A knock.

Not on the trapdoor.

On the base of the tower, far below.

One heavy knock, metal on wood.

I stood so fast the chair scraped.

I leaned toward the floor hatch, listening.

Another knock.

Then, faintly, a voice from below, carried up through the stairwell like someone standing at the bottom and shouting carefully.

“Ranger!”

My skin tightened.

No one should have been down there. The access road is gated at night. There are signs. There are cameras, even if they’re old.

I moved to the window and looked down.

The base of the tower was a black shape among darker trees. The moonlight didn’t reach the ground well.

I saw nothing.

Then the voice came again, from directly below the tower, and it sounded like dispatch.

“Lookout Three, come down. We need you.”

My mouth went numb.

Dispatch would never tell me to leave the tower at night for a lost camper without sending a unit. Dispatch would never use that tone, like it was urgent and casual at the same time.

I reached for the main dispatch handset.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “Confirm you did not send anyone to tower base.”

Dispatch answered instantly, and there was something in the operator’s voice I hadn’t heard before.

A tightness.

“Negative,” dispatch said. “No units at your location. Stay in the tower. Do not open the hatch.”

As she spoke, the voice from below overlapped her.

“Open the hatch.”

Same words. Same rhythm.

Not through the radio speaker.

Through the stairs.

It was like the tower itself was relaying it.

I backed away from the trapdoor until my shoulders hit the opposite wall.

Dispatch kept talking, faster now. “Listen to me. Do not respond to any voice that is not on this channel. Do not open the tower. Units are en route to the access road. Do you understand?”

“I understand,” I said, but my voice came out thin.

Below, the knocking started again. Slow. Patient.

Knock.

Pause.

Knock.

Like it knew I was counting.

The unmonitored radio channel hissed in the background, even with the volume low, and through it I heard my own voice whispering, “Please.”

I don’t know what did it.

I’ve replayed the next part a hundred times and I still can’t point to a single moment where my brain broke. It wasn’t a sudden decision. It was like a series of tiny rationalizations stacking up until I couldn’t see the drop-off anymore.

Maybe someone really was down there. Maybe a hiker found the tower and was terrified. Maybe dispatch was wrong and a unit had already made it to the base. Maybe, if I just cracked the hatch and called down, I could clear it up.

Maybe the laminated sheet was for something else.

Maybe I was being dramatic.

I hate myself for the thought even now, but there was another thing too.

The voice from below sounded like my brother.

My younger brother has been dead for three years. Car accident. Wrong place, wrong time, drunk driver.

I hadn’t heard his voice in a long time, not cleanly, not without memory blurring it.

From below the tower, through the stairwell, came his voice, small like he was trying not to scare me.

“Hey,” it said. “It’s cold.”

I felt my eyes sting.

I stepped toward the hatch like a sleepwalker.

Dispatch was still in my ear, but it sounded far away now, like a TV in another room.

I unlocked the trapdoor.

The second the lock turned, the knocking stopped.

The silence that followed wasn’t dramatic. It was just empty.

I pulled the hatch up an inch and peered down into the stairwell.

Blackness. A faint smell of damp wood and old rust.

I didn’t see anyone.

I didn’t hear breathing.

Then, from halfway down the stairs, the radio crackle sound happened again, but it wasn’t coming from the lookout radio.

It was coming from the stairwell itself, like static in the air.

And my brother’s voice said softly, “Come on.”

I opened the hatch fully.

The cold air that came up was wrong. It wasn’t just night air. It smelled sour, like wet fur and something metallic.

I backed up, hand on my flashlight.

Dispatch’s voice sharpened. “Lookout Three, what are you doing? Confirm you are in the tower and the hatch is secured.”

I lied.

“In the tower,” I said. “Hatch secured.”

The words tasted like pennies.

I don’t know why I lied. Maybe because part of me already knew I was about to do something I couldn’t explain.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped down into the stairwell.

The tower groaned as my weight shifted onto the stairs.

Each step down felt like stepping into thicker air. The darkness pressed in tight around the flashlight beam, making it feel small and weak. The metal railing was cold under my hand.

Halfway down, the beam caught something on a step.

A strip of reflective tape.

Park trail marker tape.

It was stuck to the metal like someone had pressed it there.

I stopped. My heart hammered.

That tape shouldn’t have been inside the tower. Nobody comes up here and starts peeling markers off trees to decorate.

The voice from below didn’t rush me.

It just said, patient, “Almost there.”

I kept going.

At the bottom, the tower’s base platform was open to the air. From there you step onto the ground, onto packed dirt and needles. The flashlight beam swept across the base supports, the old maintenance box, the little post where the fire extinguisher used to hang.

No person.

No ranger truck.

No fresh footprints.

I stood at the base of the tower and felt the night press in from all sides.

“Ranger?” I called, and my voice sounded too loud.

Nothing answered.

Then the lookout radio, still up in the cab, crackled faintly through the structure.

And in my own voice, it said, “Here.”

The word came from the trees to my left too, at the exact same time.

“Here.”

Like two speakers playing the same track.

My stomach dropped hard enough I almost gagged.

I backed toward the tower stairs.

The flashlight beam caught movement between two trunks.

Not a full shape. Just a shift. Something tall adjusting its weight.

I swung the light fully and saw it.

It was upright, but it wasn’t standing like a man. It looked assembled wrong. Too thin. Too long. Arms hanging low with too many joints.

The head was not antlers, not a clean skull like you see in cheap horror. It was like skin pulled tight over something sharp. Ridges under the surface. A mouth that didn’t sit right on the face, stretched farther than it should be.

The worst part was the eyes.

Not glowing. Not bright.

Dull, wet reflections in the flashlight beam, like stones at the bottom of a creek.

It didn’t charge.

It stepped forward once, quiet and confident, closing distance in a way my brain couldn’t map properly.

I turned and ran.

I hit the stairs and took them two at a time, boots clanging on metal. My hands shook so hard I nearly missed the railing.

Behind me, something moved through brush without crashing. It sounded like it knew exactly where to place its weight.

I got five steps up before a sound like a dry throat clicking came from right below the tower, closer than it should have been.

I looked down without meaning to.

It was on the first landing already, climbing without haste, long limbs folding wrong.

My flashlight beam caught its hands on the rail.

Hands like bundled sticks. Fingers too long, too many joints, gripping like clamps.

I bolted up again, lungs burning.

The tower creaked in protest, like it hated being part of this.

I hit the trapdoor platform and shoved the hatch up, scrambling through. My shoulder slammed the frame. Pain shot down my arm, but I didn’t care.

I got one knee into the cab and reached back to slam the hatch—

—and something caught me.

Not a grip. A swipe.

A fast, cold rake across my back through my shirt, like dragging a handful of bent nails from shoulder blade to ribs.

The pain didn’t even register right away. It was heat and shock and a breath that turned into a noise I didn’t recognize as mine.

I fell forward into the cab, slammed my palms on the floor, and kicked back hard. The hatch dropped. Wood thudded into place.

Then the burning hit full force.

I scrambled upright and fumbled for the lock. It didn’t align. My hands were shaking too much.

Below me, the hatch bumped once, gently, as if something had tested it.

Then again.

I shoved my weight onto it and finally got the lock to catch with a metallic click.

I pressed my back against the far wall of the cab and felt wetness spreading under my shirt. The scratches stung with every breath, each inhale pulling at torn fabric and skin like the injury wanted to remind me it was there.

Dispatch was still on my actual channel, voice edged with panic now.

“Lookout Three, respond. Respond now.”

Under my feet, another voice repeated her exact words a half-second later, using her tone so well it made my teeth ache.

I forced myself to key dispatch.

“It’s at the tower,” I said, words coming out in ragged pieces. “It mimics. It got into the stairwell. It—”

My voice hitched when my back spasmed.

Dispatch didn’t waste time asking what it was. “Stay away from the hatch. Barricade if you can. Units are two minutes out.”

The hatch bumped again, harder.

A sound like claws, or nails, dragging along the wood.

My stomach rolled. My back was on fire. I could taste copper at the back of my throat from biting down too hard.

I grabbed the heavy chair and shoved it over the hatch.

Then I grabbed the small table and jammed it against the chair.

The tower shook slightly, and for the first time I realized the thing wasn’t just testing the hatch.

It was putting weight on the tower.

Like it was climbing the supports.

The windows rattled.

The catwalk outside the cab gave a soft metallic ping as something stepped onto it.

The flashlight beam caught a shadow pass over the window.

Tall.

Too thin.

I backed away until I hit the far wall of the cab, my back screaming, and I nearly blacked out from the sudden flare of pain.

The radio shrieked with static. Not dispatch. The other channel.

And then, in my own voice, right in the speaker by my ear, it said softly, “Come down.”

The window behind me thudded once, like something tapped it with a knuckle.

Then again, harder.

I saw the outline press against the glass for a split second. Not a face, not clear, just a suggestion of that stretched mouth and ridged head.

The glass bowed.

It didn’t break, but it flexed enough to make me realize how old it was. How many winters it had seen. How many times it had been heated and cooled and stressed.

The thing outside didn’t rush. It didn’t slam wildly.

It tapped. Then waited. Then tapped again.

Like it knew time was on its side.

Dispatch was still talking, telling me to hold, to stay put, that headlights were on the access road, that they were almost there.

I believed her.

And then the voice on the other side of the glass said, in my brother’s voice again, small and cold, “I’m scared.”

That almost got me.

I won’t lie.

My hand moved toward the hatch without permission. A reflex built from a lifetime of responding to voices asking for help.

I stopped myself by biting down on the inside of my cheek until I tasted blood.

The tapping on the window stopped.

For a few seconds, the tower was still except for my breathing and the faint crackle of radios and the slow drip of something warm down my side under my shirt.

Then something scraped across the roof.

Slow.

Like fingernails being dragged along metal.

The sound traveled from one end of the roof to the other, then stopped above my head.

I looked up without meaning to.

The ceiling was thin paneling. If something heavy sat on it, the whole cab would feel it.

The tower creaked, a deep groan, like it was taking a breath.

And then the hatch behind my barricade bumped from below again.

Two directions.

It was on the roof and under the floor.

Or it wanted me to think it was.

Then headlights washed the trees below in white beams, sweeping back and forth.

A ranger truck.

Another.

Radios on the dispatch channel erupted with voices. Call signs. Orders. Real human urgency.

The scraping on the roof stopped immediately.

The tapping stopped.

The pressure under the hatch eased.

For one shaky breath, I thought it was over. That it would retreat when there were more people.

Then, over the unmonitored channel, in dispatch’s exact voice, came a calm instruction.

“Units, proceed off-road. Follow the voice.”

I heard a ranger on the main channel hesitate. “Dispatch, confirm.”

Dispatch snapped, real and sharp. “Negative. Stay on the road. Do not go off-road. Do not follow any voice.”

And then, like it was enjoying itself, the unmonitored channel repeated her denial in her voice but with a tiny twist, like a smile hidden in it.

“Proceed.”

Below, one of the trucks turned its lights toward the tree line, and for a brief second I saw the shape at the edge of the beams.

Tall.

Too thin.

Half-hidden like it didn’t want to be fully seen.

Then it stepped back into the woods and the darkness swallowed it.

The rangers stayed on the road. They didn’t chase. They didn’t play hero. They swept the area, found nothing, and told me to stay in the cab until morning.

When daylight came, they walked me down the tower with two people on either side like I was the fragile one.

Halfway down, my shirt had dried stiff against my back. Every step made the scratches flare again, like the air itself was cutting me.

At the base, one of the rangers asked, “You hit something?”

I shook my head once, because I didn’t know how to answer without sounding like a lunatic.

At the park office later, I tried to explain what happened in a way that didn’t make me sound like I’d lost my mind in the dark. I talked about radio interference. About prank calls. About an animal under the tower.

The older clerk behind the counter didn’t laugh.

She slid a binder toward me, opened to a page that looked like it had been read too many times.

Incident reports. Dates. Channels. Notes about mimicry and unmonitored frequencies.

At the bottom of the page was a line underlined twice.

If it uses your voice, it already has you.

They sent me to urgent care in town anyway, the way they do when paperwork starts to smell like liability. The nurse didn’t ask many questions. She just had me turn around, lifted my shirt carefully, and went quiet for a second.

“You got lucky,” she said.

They cleaned the scratches, bandaged them in long strips, and told me to watch for infection. The back of my shirt went into a plastic bag like evidence. I drove home with my shoulders tight, trying not to move too much because every shift tugged at the raw lines under the gauze.

I quit volunteering the next week.

Not out of fear of the woods in general. I can walk a trail in daylight and enjoy it like anyone.

I quit because I learned something I can’t unlearn.

There are rules out there that aren’t about bears or weather or dehydration. There are rules about what happens when you ask for help the wrong way, on the wrong channel, in the wrong place.

And there’s one more detail I haven’t told anyone in the park system because I don’t want to see the look on their faces.

Sometime after midnight, a couple nights later, I finally fell asleep in my own bed.

I woke up at 2:17 a.m. exactly.

Not the slow drift up from a dream. The kind where your eyes open and your body is already tight, like it heard something before your brain caught up.

My back ached under the bandages. I could feel the scabbed lines pulling every time I breathed too deep.

The apartment was quiet. No cars. No neighbors. The heater clicked once and stopped.

Then I heard it.

Not from outside.

From inside the room.

A soft burst of static, like a speaker waking up.

A click.

My throat closed. I sat up so fast the sheet tangled around my legs.

The sound came again, clearer now. Static, then a tiny, controlled squelch, like someone had keyed a mic and let go.

It wasn’t my phone. My phone was on the dresser, dark and charging.

I swung my bedside lamp on.

The light filled the room, bright and normal, and for half a second my brain tried to calm down. Tried to tell me it was nothing.

Then I saw the green glow.

A faint, sick little rectangle of light coming from the crack under my bedroom door.

My heart started banging hard enough to make my vision pulse.

I got out of bed and limped to the door, barefoot, quiet, holding my breath like it mattered.

I opened it.

The hallway was lit only by the kitchen nightlight. The glow on the floor wasn’t from that.

It was coming from my living room.

I stepped out and followed it, slow, like approaching a trap you can already see.

On my coffee table—centered like someone had placed it carefully—was the tower radio from the lookout.

I knew it instantly.

Not because of the model.

Because I could see the black electrical tape wrapped around the antenna base, and that crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner of the casing—the one I’d noticed because it made the radio sit crooked in its cradle up in the cab. The faceplate sticker was still sun-faded, but in the lamplight I could make out the handwritten block letters if I leaned close enough.

LOOKOUT 3.

And taped to the side of it—pressed flat, neat as a label—was a strip of reflective trail marker tape.

I didn’t touch it.

I just stood there, staring at the radio like it was a live animal.

The speaker crackled again.

Click.

Then my own voice came out of it, patient and calm, the way I sound when I’m trying to keep somebody else from panicking.

“Lookout Three… do you copy?”

I backed up until my shoulders hit the wall, and the movement tugged at my bandages hard enough to make me hiss.

The radio clicked again, and this time it didn’t use my voice.

It used dispatch.

Sharp. Official. Convincing.

“Confirm you are secure.”

I stood there in my hallway, barefoot, shaking, staring at a radio that didn’t belong in my apartment, and I realized something that made my stomach turn cold.

It wasn’t just copying voices.

It wasn’t just playing with a frequency.

It knew where the tower was.

It knew where I lived.

And it knew exactly what words would make me answer.

I didn’t answer.

I didn’t even breathe right.

I walked backward into my bedroom and shut the door and locked it like that meant anything.

The radio kept talking out in my living room, voice changing every few seconds—mine, dispatch, my brother—cycling through the ones that worked best.

I stayed in my room until sunrise, listening to it through the wall like you listen to an intruder moving around your house.

At 6:41 a.m., it went quiet.

No static. No click.

Just silence.

When I finally opened my door, the radio was gone.

There was no mark on the table. No tape. No dust disturbed. No sign it had ever been there.

Except for one thing.

On the hardwood in front of my coffee table, right where the green glow had pooled, was a single strip of reflective tape pressed flat to the floor like a breadcrumb.

1qb898t,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1qb898t/i_quit_social_media_for_2_months_and_now_i_see/,"I quit social media for 2 months, and now I see that this society is so ruined","So, 2 months ago I decided to quit all social media (except for Whatsapp and Reddit) because I was feeling too anxious and overwhelmed by all the noise I had in my head.

When I started to become more calmer, I was sitting in a local coffee shop waiting for my order but then I saw everyone around me just starring at their phones like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Couples sitting together but not talking. People waiting three minutes for coffee and acting like those three minutes were annoying. And it hit me that I used to do the exact same thing without even noticing it.

Now, what helped me stick with the detox wasn’t discipline or motivation. Tbh I don’t have that much willpower haha. So what helped was understanding why I spent too much time doing these things in the first place: Reading a few books helped me achieving this.

[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work): Re-learn how to focus deeply

It showed me how rare real focus has become. I started blocking time where my phone stayed in another room. At first it felt dramatic and kind of stupid tbh. But after a few sessions, it totally made the difference. This my fav book so far

[Dopamine Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55723020-dopamine-nation): Reset your brain’s dopamine balance

This book made me realize scrolling stopped being about fun a long time ago. I just realized it’s mostly about escaping discomfort. My brain learned to escape the moment things got boring, so silence felt wrong. Once I understood that, I stopped grabbing my phone for comfort and started embracing the silence I needed.

[Hooked](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked): See how apps are designed to hook you

This made me hate all social media apps fr. It explains how products trap you in loops with triggers and random rewards. I stopped scrolling through shitty videos and posts and I buried social apps, removed shortcuts, and made accessing them annoying on purpose.

Reading changed how I think, but these tools helped me actually do something with that clarity.

[Notion](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/notion-notas-tareas-e-ia/id1232780281): Clear the noise in your head

This tool helped me to get ideas out of my head and onto a page. Goals, habits, random thoughts, EVERYTHING. You can easily do this in paper, but I'd rather using it here. That alone reduced a ton of mental noise.

[Purposa](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/purposa-chase-your-dreams/id6748883803): Focus on your one daily goal

Literally the title. It has some pretty interesting features yeah, but this one alone made the whole difference. Instead of bunch of daily goals, I just focused on the most important one. This tool made me more focus and consistent in my goals.

[Opal](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/opal-tiempo-de-pantalla-focus/id1497465230): Protect your attention

It blocked distracting apps during focus time so willpower didn't decide for me. Fortunately, this made me focus longer and starting losing FOMO.

But well, I still use my phone and I still use Reddit (to learn and give value, no more than that). I just don’t feel I am attached to it anymore.

Quitting social media wasn’t easy AT ALL, don’t get me wrong. I had a terrible FOMO at first, but then it started to decrease. So yeah, it gets easier.

So start small: Delete one app, read one chapter, write one page and track one habit. This will led you to the goal you always wanted.

It’s certainly humbling and embarrassing to be hungry and quite literally broke, and to be asking for help publicly, but I’m not sure what else to do. I’d like to preface by saying that I’m not a drinker, a drug user, and I do not smoke. I am just hungry and thirsty, not hoping for some quick cash or etc. 

Why am I stuck at the airport? 

Well, to be totally transparent; I came here to sleep for the past two nights (have been here since Saturday evening) as I’ve not got a home at the moment and am in the midst of going back to Edmonton after years of off and on struggles here. 

I left my shared apartment on January 1st - committed to the transfer back home- and I’ve got a construction job lined up and everything, what a blessing. 

“Why am I broke?” 

For the past 6 weeks I worked my butt off at Embers (a temp agency) as well as TLC and managed to secure myself a little bachelor apartment in YEG and even booked myself a flight (Wednesday 715am). 

I’ve got proof of all of the above, and am quite literally just sitting around in the domestic food court keeping warm and using the wifi, have been doing so since Saturday evening.

Anywho; I am completely flat broke now- and as aforementioned; while I don’t have any want or need for actual cash - I’m hoping somebody might be kind enough to help with a coffee, a bagel, a subway sub, or anything* that’s on offer in here. Be that an online order, a gift card, or whatever.

Sorry for the long blurb, and thank you to anyone in advance. I feel so freaking embarrassed just typing this. Wishing everyone a prosperous and happy 2026, regardless. 

- Joshua 

PS: I would even go as far as to “trade” a silver necklace and saint Christopher pendant which I regularly wear and have cared for. I did post on FB marketplace yesterday for a low price, but no bites so far. I didn’t want to post it, and I certainly didn’t want to post this- but dang it I’m hungry, man. Alternatively- I would also graciously accept help with the airport sky train cost, and could perhaps access a free meal program downtown. ",70,1768254164.0,askvan,41,0.87,False

1qb875o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qb875o/need_unbiased_opinion_on_shared_finances_question/,Need unbiased opinion on shared finances question in a marriage (Baptist household).,"Hello, all! This is my first time posting in this subreddit, so please let me know if I can breaking any rules or if there is a better forum for my questions.

A little bit of background, my husband (39M) and I (33F) have been married for almost 7 years. He brought quite a bit of debt into our marriage. I was aware during our engagement, and my thought process at the time was ""two can knock this out better than one"" and ""everyone makes mistakes."" This is still my opinion, however, instead if debt getting better, it seems to be getting worse. All of our finances are shared, so it is a point of contention for us. We did start keeping a budget and it's taking practiec but we are on the right track. If more context on our income and lifestyle is needed, please let me know. 

  
I've recently taken up the project of decluttering my stuff. Growing up with not a lot of money, I've had to learn that it's okay to get rid of things or throw things away - not everything needs to be kept forever. That things that are in good condition, I donate. Things are in excellent condition and on the pricier side, I've been selling on Facebook. As nervous as I was to do start doing this, it's been an incredible experience, and I've met some really amazing people. I've always shared with my husband, what I'm selling, for how much, and where I'm meeting people when I go. None of this has been a secret or hidden. 

  
Since some people pay with CashApp, I've been using that quite a bit, and they asked me if I wanted a debit card. I checked and I don't have to have a minimum balance, there are no fees, nothing to do with credit - just blank debit card linked to my CashApp account. My husband, when it came in the mail was really upset about it and said that I should have told him about the card since it's a finance thing. I apologized and explained that it's just a debit card, there's nothing sneaky about it, and it's only linked to my CashApp, which had maybe $6 at the time. He was still very upset about it, but we had moved on. Or so I had thought. 

Flash forward to this weekend. My husband has a full time job, and also what you can consider a side job for his college classes/certification. He asked me yesterday if he could just use the money he makes from that for fun money. I was really taken aback by this because we talked about it helping with our debt and/or building an emergency fund. I mentioned this to him and he said that it was no different from me selling things on Facebook and assuming that I could keep the money. He said that he didn't want the money from the sales, but he was upset that I never considered that I was essentially stealing money from the family. This was really surprising, because, other than the CashApp card, he has never expressed this before. He asked me if I would be okay if he hold things and kept the money for himself, and I told him the truth, which was yes. I have even offered to help  him post things before and have met people on his behalf to sell things, like his old Nintendo switch when he got a new one. He put that money in our account, but because we technically didn't have the money for the new switch in the first place. And I had let him know that I would help him sell it if that's what he wanted.

I admittedly had never viewed it this way, and I do see where he is coming from. I think maybe the delivery just rubbed me the wrong way? I'm not sure. I use it as coffee money, essentially or for compensating people that watch our dog something like that. I just want an opinion from the outside because after this conversation I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I do feel awful that I never considered the funds from my sells to be shared or stealing. But this also has what feels like controlling undertones? I've been in controlling/abusive relationships in the past, so I am unfortunately to familiar to what this feels like. Please let me know what your thoughts are!

C/W: Assistant Suicide/Suicide

“ I Wish I Was Dead.”

The spirit of Janet McAdams was thrown into a world of guilt as her body was lowered six feet into the world.

The Earth is greyed out with rain clouds hovering over the Hallowdale Cemetery. The clouds, dull in nature yet vicious for blocking Janet’s guiding light to the other side. A dove flashes its whitening feathers as it soars out of its prison.

Her family sat front row at their youngest daughter's funeral. Her mother, an overweight diabetic missing her left foot, blew her tears into a booger-drenched handkerchief. Her father, a blind drunk, showed nothing. Not a tear to stroke his cheek, or a swallow of held-back rage. Nothing.

- Typical of father. 

“Janet was a bright young soul who was sadly taken away from us too early,” says a priest, raising his hands to worship. “God doesn't like to steal away the youth from their parents, nor does it bring him another angel closer to his gates. God does it because God wants lessons to be learned. God wants clarity on who He judges. He wants transparency of the heart. He does not want to steal your children for fun. God does what He believes is best for His children. And for Janet McAdams, God wanted death.”

The priest pounds his fist on the pedestal.

- Thanks, God. Now I know suicide isn't the answer.

Suicide is never the answer, but it's the answer Janet McAdams wanted to learn. Her parents were very adamant against Janet’s decision in going through with assisted suicide.

“Cancer,” says the doctor, a woman wearing googly glasses. “I’m sorry Mrs. McAdams, but it's stage three endometrial cancer.”

“Is it terminal?” Janet McAdams asks, no choke in her throat nor a stumble of her words. “I don't care if it's stage five. Is it terminal?” 

“Well, no… we caught it before it could be terminal,” the doctor says, adjusting her glasses to continue reading her chart. “Which is great. We can offer a hysterectomy to remove the tumor.”

“You’re not violating me with tools, let alone get a chance to forget one in my vagina.”

“There is radiation and chemotherapy.”

“Too expensive.”

“Your parents' insurance could help pay for it.”

“I turned twenty-six last month.”

“Oh…”

“‘Oh’ is right. I'm fucked,” Janet says with annoyance, gathering her belongings.

“Now Miss Janet, you're not. There are ways of getting assistance through Medicaid.”

“I make too much.”

“If you make too much, then payment shouldn't be a problem.”

“I make too much for Medicaid, but not enough to pay the bills on my own.”

“There are spend-down programs that cou—”

“I won't let my family go bankrupt because of me.” Janet cuts her off. “My family doesn't need to be strained enough as they already are.”

“Wouldn’t they want to help? They're your family.”

“That's the problem. They're my family!” Janet's voice intensifies. She backs herself into the corner of the doctor's office. “You see how devastating my mom's health is. Poor woman gets called ‘Peggy the Pirate’ by the twerps on our block. My dad can't walk straight—not because of his blind ass—but because the man drinks like a bull due to my brother's ineptitude to get a job, which raises my mother's blood pressure, the exact reason for her latest heart attack.”

Janet swings her purse over her shoulder.

“That's my family,” she yells before shutting the office door.

Janet walks down the hallway with a sprint in her heels. Tears build up in her ducts, but refuse to pour. Janet McAdams was always a “tough cookie”, but for the first time in her life, she was petrified.

“I’m always the one who has to sacrifice for this family.”

- That is my family right there. I don't hate them—just disappointed. But I know they are with me.

“I wish I was dead,” Janet mumbles.

“And for Janet McAdams, God wanted death,” the priest pounds his fist on the pedestal. “Death is only the end for individuals, but not for those who still breathe. Now is a time to congregate with hindsight. To unravel the lessons from the shroud of regret. Ones that Janet has planted within her loved ones.”

Mrs. McAdams is hysterical, thrashing in her wheelchair like a demon before an exorcist. Mr. McAdams does nothing, but snorts back his melancholy. The priest walks over to the McAdams. He places his right hand on Mrs. McAdams’ shoulder. 

“Let us pray for this grieving mother who lost her bright and joyous ‘little sunshine’,” the priest preaches, lowering his head.

- I always hated that Mom would call me “little sunshine”… I miss it. But this little sunshine did expose glints in her family.

After the funeral, the McAdams returned to an empty home. Mrs. McAdams juggles the keys in the lock. The door opens up to a heavily decorated living room of pricey—way too pricy—accesory bags, IP-branded collectibles, and scattered unwashed clothes. 

“The boys must still be hiding,” Mrs. McAdams says.

“They should've been at their sister's burial,” Mr. McAdams yells.

“They were at her viewing.”

“They weren't there on her last day either.”

Mrs. McAdams doesn't respond. Her head hangs with shame.

“Did they at least clean the living room?” Mr. McAdams asks, guiding himself with the couch.

Mrs. McAdams shakes her head. “They started it, but didn’t finish.”

As usual.

“Let them grieve,” Mrs. McAdams defends them. “They lost their sister.”

“Then they should've been at her funeral!” Mr. McAdams replies, swinging his hand in the air. “Why did she have to go and die?”

“She wanted to, honey.”

“No one wants to die. Who the hell wants to die young?” A tear pools out his right eye.

- I did. I didn't want to burden you all with another stack of logs on the fire. With Mom’s frequent hospital visits straining the family's finances, I knew my treatment wasn’t worth it. Not for me, when the next year would be nothing but blood in my vomit, my jet-black hair disintegrating, and isolation from my family in the next room. And not for the family, who would be worrying if my mother would tilt over.

- I'm sorry Dad, but no. I wanted to die.

“This is what I want,” Janet says, conviction roaring in her words. “I want to die.” 

Her family is a bag of mixed nuts.

Mr. McAdams shrouds his stillness as stoicism. “If that's what you want, then so be it.”

“Not so be it!” Mrs. McAdams urges, lifting herself out of her wheelchair. “We’ll get a loan. I'll take out a second mortgage on the house.”

“You aren't doing none of that, Mom.” Darell McAdams responds. Darell is tall, but not basketball-player tall. His brown hair matches his brown eyes and brown teeth. “I can ask Claire’s father for some extra cash.”

“Don’t you owe him like five thousand since last March?” Tory McAdams butts in. Tory is the same height as Janet, but not the same weight. He is swollen like a beach ball,with heavy, difficult breaths to match.

“This is an emergency,” Darell replies.

“You said that last time,” Mr. McAdams states, drinking his coffee. “She wants to die, let her die. She made up her mind.”

“Thank you, dad, for seeing it my way,” Janet says, placing her hand on his. He recoils.

- That stubborn  asshole would never show emotions. Why did he have to wait until I was dead to cry?

“I don't see it your way,” Mr. McAdams retorts, looking toward his daughter. “I don't want to understand why you want to kill yourself either. I think it's stupid you think you're better off dying. You know what it would do to your mom?”

“No I don't know what it would do to her, but living with you has brought her closer to death than I ever would,” Janet says, retreating from her father.

“The situation we are in is what raises my blood,” Ms. McAdams says. “I’m behind on our mortgage. I’m going to lose my office. My medicine keeps getting expensive. It's too fucking much for me all at once. I stress eat—”

“That doesn't help either,” Tory whispers. 

“And that doesn't help,” Mrs. McAdams continues. “But we can get through it. As a family. Like Nana said, ‘Keep the family together.’”

“Nana isn't here anymore, Mom,” Janet cuts her off. “Plus I know what I want for my life. I’m organizing my affairs—but I want to keep things private. Just know and respect my privacy.”

“Killing yourself isn't something very private,” Mr. McAdams interjects.

“It's private when you plan on ending it in a closet on a day when everyone goes to Disneyland,” Janet roars, throwing her hands in the air. “Jesus Christ, maybe you guys will benefit from this.”

“How the fuck do you benefit from your own child killing themselves?” Mrs. McAdams screams.

Janet breaks eye contact with her distraught mother. Her brothers comfort their mom. Her dad struggles to find the remote to the TV. He does get it and turns it on.

Click.

- Dying isn't like the movies. I didn't see my life flash before my eyes. Dying wasn't scary. Dying was rejuvenating.

Click.

The door unlocks. Walking in was Tory and Darell, the latter with a letter.

“Where the hell were you?” Mr. McAdams questions. “Everyone asked where you two were. It was embarrassing telling the family ‘they didn't love their sister much’.”

“No he didn't,” Mrs. McAdams jumps in, smacking his head. 

“I might as well,” Mr. McAdams mumbles.

“Janet told us not to show up to her funeral,” Tory explains. “She sent us a letter and it arrived a week after she died. It was addressed to us.”

“Why didn't you tell us?” Mrs. McAdams demands, raising herself from her wheelchair. “Give me it.”

Darell hands over the letter.

“It’s for the family,” Tory adds.

“It's from Janet…,” Mrs. McAdams utters. “What could it be?”

“It’s best if—” Tory stops, choking on his words. “You need to open it, Mom.”

Mrs. McAdams spares no second in shredding the envelope open like a cat swiping a bird from a cage. She unfolds the letter. She begins to laugh hysterically, then crying uncontrollably. Mr. McAdams breaks his gaze from the TV to console his wife.

“What did you guys do?” Mr. McAdams yells.

“Janet did it,” Darell answers.

“She’s dead,” Mr. McAdams reminds them. “She’s dead and left us with noth—.”

“She left us one hundred thousand dollars,” Tory blurts out.

“She did wh—.” Mr. McAdams stops himself to catch the tears raining out his eyes.

“Life insurance,” Darell adds. 

“What does her letter say?” Mr. McAdams says.

“It reads,” Mrs. McAdams wipes away her tears.

- To my family, 

- For the first time in my life, I want to be honest with you all. We aren't a perfect family. We're more of a mess than our house, but that doesn't mean I don't love you. I wasn't the best daughter or sister. I'm sorry, but I wasn't going to be the leak that sank our family more into debt.

- I know Mother has always been the provider for our family, but her body deteriorated under the stress of being the breadwinner. I wasn't going to make it—even with chemotherapy—and I’m perfectly fine with that. Just know I’ll be waiting for you to see your little sunshine again.

- I hope my brothers can finally realize that their everyday routine of video games isn't going to help Mom when I am gone. Please, after the years I’ve annoyed you, get a job and take the weight off of our parents’ shoulders. You guys always made me proud, and I’m sorry for not saying it more often.

- I know Father would never understand my decision, so I'm hoping the check clears up my secrecy. I wanted to make up for what you think would be my biggest mistake. I know you will never accept it, but just know I did it to keep the family together.

- With all my love,

- Janet McAdams 

 “Why did I have to lose my daughter?” Mr. McAdams cries, begging the sky for answers. “I didn’t get to say ‘I loved her’ one last time…”

Bzzzrt—bzzzrt—bzzzrt—

Janet smashes her ahead against a metal table, silencing the doomsday clock buzzer.

“NOOOOO!” Janet flares from her lungs. “No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I don’t want to die!  Please make it stop.”

Janet rips her from her restraints, dislocating one of her wrists. She winces in pain. Her arms strike the table, leaving a forearm-shaped dent.

“I want to see my family,” Janet continues to bash her forehead into the metal table, shattering the W.W.Y.S. goggles. Shards of cheap tempered plastic barrage into her pupils.

“I saw what you wanted to teach me,” Janet cries into the dark room. “Let me go home.”

The adrenaline of fear and the will to live collided as Janet rips out her connectors, blood spits from her temples.

“I want to go home,” Janet pleads, her blood smeared hands pressed against the two-way window. “I want to see my family. Help me, daddy. I'm sorry for what I said. I'm sorry. I don't want to d—”

Her microphone is cut off. Only the sounds of regretful pounding on the window.

“Shame,” says an authoritative feminine voice. “Test subject 634 was the one to get the furthest in her treatment.”

like a gunshot to the chest 

ears buzzing

shell shocked

tremors all over

Feeling separated

not present

the mind floats over buildings

cities

infrastructure we once knew

held together

separated now by streets

ideas

loves/hates



it’s become us

infested us



we’re not the same we —

rolling through Omaha fields

and touching west coast stones



we’ve become things despised 

a dirty mirror laid bare —

this is us.

Don’t lie.

Not anymore.



The poison of mind

of body

now the nectar of life

the sustained high

the daily precipice.



Mask no more

want no more

hide behind the skin no more

words and talk no more



the bullshit is cut

and it’s a blank page.



How will chisel and hammer fare if not sharpened daily?

How will screams break glass?

How can we keep on without being?



An echo of drum

the dawn of siesta

coffee and tea

while Tampa ghosts

escort you back home.



Shackled no more

whipped no more 

separate the want from need

and bleed no more



the mic dropped

but you pick it up—

a PSA—

an assault to all ears and eyes

one through the heart

piercing from infinity



the birth of someone

some… thing.. 

fresh

picked ripe

It starts with you.

No one else can empathize

1qb7zz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1qb7zz7/did_a_threeyearold_just_ruin_my_43f_and_my/,Did a three-year-old just ruin my (43f) and my husband's (51m) closest friendship?,"I'm sorry if this post is disorganized as my thoughts are all over the place right now. For background, my husband and I have known our friends, (51m and 41f) for over ten years now. We met in a small arts community in our city and now see ourselves as basically family. A few years ago, we even underwent the IVF journey at the same time, laughing and commiserating as we experienced the highs and lows of that. Our daughter (3f) was born three months before their son (3m), and they have grown up side by side with no problems other than what you'd expect out of three-year-olds (their son can struggle with sharing, while my daughter can be bossy). About one year ago, our friends got married and my husband and I were both in the wedding. I was honored to be the matron of honor. It has been a beautiful friendship.

Our daughter has a rare chromosomal disorder that has caused significant feeding and speech issues and some motor skills delay (she's cognitively right on track). While her feeding is now normal, she still tests about a year behind in how she can verbally express herself. I've always worried if this condition would affect her ability to make friends, but so far, this hasn't affected her relationship with our friends' son, and as far as we and our friends could tell, the kids have had a very close relationship (again, as three-year-olds go), running, laughing and occasionally holding hands out and about. Their son is my daughter's best friend. She talks about him often and is always excited to see him. 

I feel like that's enough exposition to get to the disaster we're struggling with right now. Our friend's son's third birthday party was two days ago (they had it late due to the holiday season). My daughter was of course beside herself with excitement, practicing singing ""happy birthday"" the entire drive there and announcing to everyone at the party that she was going to sing happy birthday and eat cake. The party was at one of those indoor play gyms, which is a nightmare when you have a kid with motor skills and speech delays, so my husband or I stuck pretty close by her on the equipment to ensure safety. We were really the only parents who did that other than the parents of a two-year-old girl who is also part of our social group.

Upon arrival, my daughter whipped off her shoes and raced across the room and I caught up just in time to witness her run up to the birthday boy and shout the most joyful, ""hi!"" I've ever heard, only for him to turn around, shove her, and say, ""you're not my friend."" Then he turned back around and ran off while I watched my daughter's little heart break before my eyes. I don't know exactly what I should have done at that point in terms of communicating with our friends or leaving the party or...whatever. I did pick her up and we went back to the party area, where she saw other friends and immediately ran off with them. My husband hauled after her and he stayed with her for a long time until he came back with her sobbing. He said he'd witnessed our friend's son shove her THREE times unprovoked, and he said that the boy told her during cake that she wasn't funny. As we were talking about what to do, our daughter decided she wanted to slide, so she ran off to climb up the equipment, our friends' son appeared out of nowhere, and he shoved her again in front of both of us!   
  
My husband and I at this point were comparing notes of what we'd seen and when. I said we needed to leave, my husband pointed out that it was very sticky and that in any other circumstance he'd have the other parents involved, but it was the boy's birthday party. Also, our daughter seemed to want to keep playing. We agreed that we now needed to be in arm's reach of her at all times and prevent any and all contact with our friends' son. I went and cried for a bit in the car because I was bullied as a child and was getting very upset by all of this.  
  
By the time I got back, things were going well until my daughter wanted to go down the biggest slide. Our friends' son was at the top poised to go down, but then he saw us waiting to use the slide and he looked at me straight in the eyes and said, ""I don't want \[daughter's name\] to use the slide."" I just held his gaze and said, ""we'll wait our turn."" He stared at me a few seconds like an effing preschool psychopath, deciding if him just sitting there and not sliding was worth making my daughter miserable, eventually deciding he'd rather slide. My daughter seemed to enjoy her last trip down the slide but I'd had it by that point, the party was wrapping up anyway, and we just left. Normally, I'd have helped our friends clean up and load their car, but I honestly just didn't want to look at any of them.

The rest of the afternoon at home went ""fine,"" except my daughter kept apologizing out of nowhere. It was so strange, she'd just walk by and say, ""I'm sorry Mommy,"" or ""I'm sorry, Daddy."" We kept telling her she didn't hurt anyone, and she was kind and gentle and had no reason to apologize, but it can be hard to know what she does and doesn't really understand with the speech delay. Before bed, she did say her friend pushed her and I said, ""you're a good friend, what he did wasn't kind."" I'm not sure if it helped. She just lied down and asked for her song and fell asleep. When she was in bed, my husband removed all pictures of our friends and their son from our digital picture frame album so our daughter didn't have to be constantly reminded about it. Yesterday morning she looked very dejected when I told her to start playing and I'd join her after having some coffee first. I realized she must still be processing, so I felt terrible and ran right into her room to play. She wasn't herself yesterday, uncharacteristically aggressive and territorial about her belongings. 

We talk about it constantly out of her earshot. There are mitigating factors here. First, our friends just had a baby girl, who is around 2 months old at this point. Second, they've always been a sort of ""fly by the seat of the pants"" family. There are no bedtimes or real routines and there's a great chance the boy was exhausted that day. Or he was overly stimulated due to it being his birthday party. Or he was exhausted and overstimulated simultaneously. I feel it's more likely our daughter's speech delay is embarrassing to him around his school friends so he had to look good by shunning her. 

Anyway, it's now been 48 hours and we still haven't told them. They'll just feel terrible and it's not like they can do anything about a three-year-old's behavior unless it's in the moment. Absent a time machine, the damage is already done where my daughter is concerned. We can't in good conscience risk her being treated like that again on our watch. I hate confrontation and was bullied as a child, so I've suggested maybe we just have to quiet quit the relationship and let it fizzle out. My husband is taking a more measured approach as usual, pointing out that if our daughter had behaved like this towards another child, we'd be absolutely devastated that we'd lost our best friends without even being allowed an opportunity to address it. I said whatever factors led to the boy's behavior were unlikely to change, so I don't see a way forward. My husband often criticizes this binary way of thinking in me, but I grew up being told ""so-and-so didn't mean it"" and was constantly expected to live in a state of  stress, so I don't really give jack about intent as an adult and I always promised myself I'd do better protecting my daughter (so far doing a bad job of it, I know). Either way, logically, if we can only get together without the kids, and it's because their kid treated ours like crap in a targeted, sustained way, I don't know how this friendship survives. I'm feeling a lot of grief and have literally spent every private moment in tears during the last 48 hours. 

So what's the answer? What do we do as parents and friends?

TL;DR Our longtime best friends' son was cruel to our daughter in a targeted, sustained way and broke her little heart. I don't know what to do or if the friendship can survive.",1,1768253651.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

1qb7yip,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qb7yip/nazi_joe_schultz/,Nazi Joe Schultz,"I love Fall colors.  I hated the rats and mice that invaded my airy leaky fixer upper home after the first frost!  I've killed a few hundred! 

The other day, I ran into a YouTube video showing someone shooting rats in a barn. Loved it!  Yesterday, a friend told me the meat packing plant in Fort Worth hired some old man to shoot rats at night. Paid him a god damn bounty per tail! 

I thought it time I made up a story! 

""The following story is based on real life events.... ""

Joe Schultz scared all the neighbor kids.  Scared me even more since I lived next door to Joe and his wife.  He never said anything to me (until years later.)  Always spoke to himself.  In German.  Words like schweinehund and sheiss and dreck.  (My friend Bobby had German parents, and he told me about the words.)  Joe would sit for hours in his backyard muttering to himself.  His voice, low and rumbling like distant thunder, matching his big hands.  His dark countenance.  His sad eyes.

Joe came home every day a little after the sun came up.  Always carried a Pillsbury flour gunny sack with fresh dark stains.  He’d wash it in a basin in the backyard and hang it over their stone fence.  He had two sacks, one would be drying while the other accompanied Joe on his nightly errands.  One drying.  One traveling with Joe.

We kids talked about Joe and his gunny sacks.  Was he a Mafia hit man who dismembered victims, carrying them around in his sack?  I preferred to think he was a Nazi escapee from World War justice, muttering German mutterings about German darkness and gloom.  Of course, maybe, he was just a local butcher who sold bones to local dog owners?  We saw no logic in the butcher angle and usually Joe was a murderer with dark secrets.

After cleaning chores, Joe always sat in his backyard under a catalpa tree (in the summer) or on the back porch in the sun (in the winter)… smoking.  Camels.  No filters.  Two packs a day.  That’s what Bobby told me.  Me, I think he rolled his own cigarettes using paper left over from the War, paper stamped with swastikas.

Never saw Joe’s wife.  She must have been half rabbit with an underground entrance and an exit on the next street over.  Never saw her!  Only heard her when time to eat when she called “kom essen” from the kitchen window. Odd!  I don’t remember anything other than her voice.  It also sounded low and rumbling.  Not as low but just as scary!

Bloody gunny sacks…
Scheinehund…
Scheis und dreck…
Camel cigarettes
Kom essen

That was Joe to me until my father got me a job at the local Swift meat-packing plant when I turned eighteen. That's when Joe changed from my terrifying neighbor to an even more terrifying adult nightmare!

Joe  shot rats!

Collected them in his god damn gunny sack during the night.  Cut off their tails in the morning, threw away the rats and presented the tails to management in the morning.  He was paid four bits for every rat tail presented!

Closing whistle at 5.  Sun went down a few hours later.  That’s when my neighbor Nazi rat executioner arrived at Swift to exact his swift justice on varmints and vermin residing within the plant… Flashlight attached to his .22 rifle, lining up on beady eyes, killing with lead “poisoning”.  Then throw them into his Pillsbury sack.  Slow, steady work.  No workplace drama during lunch break for Joe!

One morning I got to work early and was sitting outside on a bench sipping coffee.  It was still dark outside.  A couple of times, I heard what sounded like a gunshot within the building which had to be Joe. A little while later, Joe came out of the building carrying his freshly stained and bulging gunny sack. When Joe saw me staring at him, he stopped. He looked at me with his Adolf Eichmann eyes. Then he said to me the only two English words I ever heard him say...

Anyone have recommendations for a nice, chill place that serves Irish/Spanish coffees that isn't necessarily a rowdy bar or just a restaurant? 

I want to start taking myself out again and one thing I used to do to treat myself when I studied in Toronto was taking myself out to cozy pubs/late night cafes etc or my friend's old restaurant. I would order myself a Spanish or Irish coffee and bring a sketch book, homework, or laptop and just do my thing and chill. I really miss doing that for myself. I realized one of the only times I really go out is for the gym and groceries (and during the summer and fall, during daylight, I go for hikes here and there). 

  
I know the Happy Goat in Hull stays open later and serves alcohol. I love that place but what if I want to explore an other placeand see what else is around? 

  
Thanks for the recs. I'm 30 years old and recently realized how much I had fallen into isolating myself outside of work and also forgotten how to do these kinds of things for myself again.

But this shiny yellow metal has wormed its way into some of the most unexpected corners of modern life. From the food you eat to the gadgets you use every day, gold is everywhere, doing things you'd never expect.**

# Gold You Can Actually Eat

Yes, you read that right. People eat gold. Not in a desperate survival situation, but on purpose, for fun. Gold leaf and gold flakes have become a luxury food garnish that shows up on everything from fancy desserts to artisan pizzas. You'll find it floating in expensive cocktails, adorning wedding cakes, and even sprinkled on top of ice cream sundaes that cost more than a nice dinner.

[Edible Gold Leaf is Popular on Wedding Cakes](https://preview.redd.it/z9429ur8mzcg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9b78aea750523c6ad7e484f72ddce72ceba2d41)

The cool thing is that gold is completely inert, meaning it passes right through your digestive system without doing anything at all. It won't poison you, it won't nourish you, it just makes your food look ridiculously fancy. Some high end restaurants in Dubai and New York have made gold covered steaks and burgers a signature item. Is there any actual reason to eat gold? Not really. Does it make you feel like royalty? Absolutely.

Marcus Briggs, a gold industry expert, has predicted for the 2026 season that edible gold will move beyond ultra luxury items and start appearing in more everyday premium products. We might see gold flaked energy drinks or specialty coffees hitting mainstream markets soon.

# Your Smartphone's Secret Ingredient

Here's something that might blow your mind. That phone in your pocket right now? It's got gold in it. A tiny amount, sure, but it's there, working hard to make sure your texts go through and your apps don't crash.

Gold is an excellent conductor of electricity and it doesn't corrode or tarnish like other metals. This makes it perfect for the delicate circuitry inside smartphones, tablets, computers, and pretty much every electronic device you own. The connectors, switches, and relay contacts often use gold because reliability matters when you're dealing with microscopic components.

In fact, there's enough gold in old electronics that some people actually mine landfills and recycling centers for discarded phones and computers. It's called urban mining, and it's becoming a real industry. One ton of old cell phones contains more gold than one ton of gold ore from an actual mine. Who knew your junk drawer was sitting on a mini gold rush?

# The Astronaut's Best Friend

Gold has literally been to space and back, multiple times. NASA uses gold in all sorts of ways because it has properties that are perfect for the harsh conditions beyond Earth's atmosphere.

The visors on astronaut helmets have a thin layer of gold coating. Why? Because gold is incredibly good at reflecting infrared radiation, which means it protects astronauts' eyes from the sun's intense, unfiltered rays in space. Without that gold layer, the sun would be blinding and dangerous.

Gold is also used extensively in spacecraft insulation. Those shiny gold and silver blankets you see wrapped around satellites and space probes? That's gold doing its thing, reflecting heat and radiation to keep sensitive instruments at the right temperature. The James Webb Space Telescope, which is giving us those amazing deep space images, is coated with gold to help it detect infrared light from the earliest galaxies in the universe.

# Medical Miracles in Gold

Gold isn't just pretty, it can actually help save lives. For decades, doctors have used gold compounds to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The gold helps reduce inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease. It's not a cure, but for many patients, gold injections or pills made a huge difference in managing pain and maintaining mobility.

More recently, researchers have been experimenting with gold nanoparticles in cancer treatment. These microscopically tiny pieces of gold can be injected into the body and programmed to seek out cancer cells.

Once they find their target, doctors can heat up the gold particles using lasers or other methods, effectively cooking the cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue alone. It's still experimental, but Marcus Briggs thinks this could be one of the most important medical applications of gold in the coming years.

Gold is also used in pregnancy tests. That little line that appears? It's made possible by gold nanoparticles that react to the pregnancy hormone. So gold might have been the first to tell you that you were going to be a parent.

# Windows That Work Smarter

Modern skyscrapers often have a thin coating of gold on their windows. You can't see it with the naked eye, but it's there, making buildings more energy efficient. The gold reflects heat back outside during summer, keeping the building cooler, and it can also help retain heat during winter.

This isn't just about comfort. It saves massive amounts of energy. A large office building with gold coated windows can cut its heating and cooling costs significantly. As energy prices rise and climate concerns grow, we're seeing more and more buildings incorporate gold into their window designs. It's one of those solutions that sounds expensive upfront but pays for itself over time.

# The Art World's Golden Touch

Artists have been obsessed with gold for thousands of years, and that obsession hasn't faded one bit. But modern artists are using gold in ways that would make ancient painters scratch their heads in confusion.

Gold leaf still shows up in traditional paintings and religious icons, just like it has for centuries. But contemporary artists are pushing boundaries. Some create entire sculptures from gold, not as a display of wealth but as commentary on value and materialism. Others use gold in digital art, creating pieces that only exist on screens but are still said to contain ""digital gold.""

Street artists have even started using gold leaf in murals and graffiti, creating pieces that catch the light and stand out from typical spray paint work. There's something powerful about seeing gold in an unexpected urban context.

Marcus Briggs mentioned in a recent conversation that he's noticed more sculptors and installation artists incorporating gold into interactive pieces, where viewers can touch and experience the metal directly.

# Gold in Your Medicine Cabinet

Beyond the major medical applications, gold shows up in some surprising pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Some high end skin care products include gold particles, claiming they can reduce wrinkles and improve skin elasticity. The science on this is mixed, but people love the luxury factor.

Certain dental fillings and crowns use gold alloys because gold is biocompatible, durable, and doesn't trigger allergic reactions like some other metals might. If you've got a gold tooth, you're carrying around a tiny investment portfolio in your mouth.

# Why Gold Keeps Winning

So why does gold end up in so many different applications? It comes down to a unique combination of properties. Gold doesn't rust or corrode, ever. It conducts electricity beautifully. It's extremely malleable, meaning you can hammer it into incredibly thin sheets or draw it into fine wires. It reflects both heat and light effectively. And it's biocompatible, so the human body doesn't reject it.

These properties make gold irreplaceable in many applications, even though it's expensive. Engineers and scientists keep finding new ways to use it because sometimes there simply isn't a good substitute.

The next time you pick up your phone, look at a skyscraper, or eat a fancy dessert, remember that gold might be part of the experience. This ancient metal that humans have treasured for thousands of years is still finding new ways to make itself useful.

From space telescopes to cancer treatment to making your burger look absurdly expensive, gold is having quite a moment. And based on current trends, that moment isn't ending anytime soon.",1,1768253465.0,u_XiphoricStretching,0,1.0,False

I’ve written mission logs hundreds of times. Coordinates. Kill counts, timelines, every operation sanitized, neat. Standard entries: who we engaged, how we moved, what we accomplished. Risk assessed, casualties recorded, objectives completed. Cold, clinical, professional.

But this… this is different.

I survived. My team didn’t. And nothing I’ve ever experienced in the field prepared me for what I saw. Not the firefights, not the ambushes, not the insurgents hiding in ruins. This was something… outside of everything I’ve trained for, outside of comprehension. Something that defies reason, logic, and everything we consider human.

If anyone finds this record, understand: I am not exaggerating. I am not dramatizing. This is the unfiltered truth. Someone else might survive if they know what’s waiting. Someone else might avoid the mistake we made.

I am a soldier, or...so I thought. Trained to remain calm under fire. Trained to process fear and act with precision. I’ve stared into the eyes of death countless times, never blinking. But I write this with my hands shaking, with my heart still hammering, and with a mind that will never forget.

What I saw… it changed everything. It shattered the rules. It took what we know about life, death, and humanity and twisted it until it was unrecognizable.
I don’t know if anyone will believe me. I don’t know if I even believe myself, some days. But it happened. And it’s still out there.

And I dare you...this is a long one. A very, very long one. So, bare with me.

We were tasked to investigate a government-run science lab, one of those “off-the-books” facilities buried deep in a forest in [REDACTED]. Access was restricted. No civilians. No press. They called it a “containment research site,” but no one outside the project knew what they were working on.

It was unreachable by normal means. Satellite imagery was limited. The closest road had been abandoned years ago. Even our transport, a modified tactical insertion vehicle, struggled through the dense undergrowth.

By the time we reached the perimeter, twilight was falling. Long, distorted shadows stretched between the trees, shifting in ways that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. 

Even Hawk, who jokes at the edge of death, went quiet.

""Feels… wrong,"" he said, voice low, NVGs scanning the forest floor.

""Eyes open,"" I said, my tone clipped. ""Slow. Steady. Every corner, every doorway. Don’t assume anything.""

Lock moved ahead, breaching tool ready. Ghost and I flanked, scanning left and right. Hawk was behind me, moving with quiet confidence, though I could hear the tension in his breathing. Viper stayed slightly back, keeping a middle arc to cover our six.

The perimeter looked normal at first glance. The barbed wire fence was intact. The main gate unlocked. No alarms, no cameras. No footprints. Too easy, too clean, too perfect.

Inside, the facility was sterile. Too clean. The fluorescent lights flickered occasionally, but nothing seemed powered down. Computers hummed softly. Papers littered the floors. Empty chairs leaned against desks. A cup of coffee tipped over, but the liquid was cold.

""Feels staged,"" Lock muttered under his breath. ""Like someone....or something wanted us to see this first.""

Hawk tried to lighten the mood with a joke, his voice strained: ""Lead us into a haunted lab, Derek. Classic Delta Team move.""

Lock rolled his eyes, muttering something about professionalism.

Ghost didn’t speak. Her eyes scanned the shadows like they were alive, catching details the rest of us missed: a floor tile slightly displaced, the way a door frame seemed warped, a corner that swallowed light unnaturally.

Viper, calm as always, adjusted her grip on the medic pack. Her eyes never left the corridor ahead, always analyzing, always calculating, always thinking three steps forward.

We joked to calm nerves, but it didn’t work. The tension had already set in. Something was here, and it knew we were coming.
Even without seeing it yet, I could feel it. 

Even before we found any bodies, something was… off. The wrongness wasn’t immediate, but it crept in slowly, like a shadow at the edge of your vision, impossible to ignore.

Chairs seemed to move on their own. One leaned slightly against the wall as we passed, though no one had touched it. Another tipped backward, scraping lightly against the tiled floor, then stopped as if caught mid-motion. 

Hawk glanced at me, eyebrows raised.

""Did one of you…?"" he asked, voice tense.

""No,"" Lock said, already scanning the room. ""Nothing moved it. I’m telling you.”

Doors opened as we approached. At first, I thought it was wind. But some had no handles, some were locked from the inside, or so the logs suggested. And every door we approached swung slightly, creaking softly, then stopped. Waiting. As if it knew we were coming.

Shadows bent unnaturally. In one hallway, the lights flickered, and a shadow along the far wall stretched impossibly long, like it had no origin. 

Ghost froze. Her head head tilting slightly and her eyes narrowing. ""Do you see that?"" she whispered.

I nodded, motioning for the team to slow. The shadow didn’t move like a normal object or person. It curved around a corner, almost liquid, and then disappeared when I blinked.

The fluorescent lights warbled briefly, then returned. It wasn’t a flicker. Not an electrical issue. It was deliberate. Uneven pulsing, like the lights were breathing. The hum deepened slightly, just enough to feel it in our chests. 

Viper shifted, checking power lines and conduits, frowning. ""All circuits normal,"" she said quietly.

Temperature shifted subtly. Some rooms were slightly warmer, some colder, though the AC hadn’t turned on. The cold pockets felt… alive. It made your skin crawl. Even Hawk muttered something about goosebumps running up his arms.

Then sounds that shouldn’t exist. A floorboard groaned two rooms ahead, though no one stepped there. A chair scraped behind us, but when we spun, nothing was there. Footsteps echoed faintly down the hall, then stopped. Silence.

I whispered. Low enough that only Ghost and I could hear: ""Eyes open. Something’s here. Something’s watching.""

We pressed on. Slowly. Room by room. Corridor by corridor. Each door opened to another sterile office, another lab, each one emptier, colder, somehow heavier than the last. The hallways narrowed, angles seeming to shift subtly as we moved, like the building itself was warping.

Every step felt heavier than the last. My boots sounded unnaturally loud, echoing down corridors that should have swallowed sound. Every corner felt like a potential ambush. Not by humans, by… something else. Something patient. Something intelligent.

Ghost moved silently ahead, rifle up, scanning. 

Lock kept his breaching tool ready, muscles tight. 

Hawk fidgeted, muttering small jokes to mask tension. 

Viper’s eyes never left the corridors in front of her, calculating, mapping, anticipating.

Even with all our training, all our experience, the creeping sense of wrongness was inescapable. 

Every detail, every anomaly, added weight to the feeling that we weren’t walking into a lab. We were walking into something alive. Something waiting.

We finally entered the main lab.

The lab itself was built into the rock, reinforced steel and concrete, a sterile capsule hidden under a forest canopy that filtered the fading sunlight. But inside, the natural world was gone. Cold, dim, antiseptic. The air smelled faintly of bleach and metal.

And there it was.

A male scientist...

""Finally, some clue.."" I whispered to myself.

Sitting on a chair, back turned to us. Its posture was unnervingly straight, unnaturally calm. It didn’t twitch. It didn’t shift. Just… sat. Waiting.

""Check if he's alive,"" I whispered, my voice low, careful.

Hawk stepped forward, hand on the rifle. His usual bravado was gone. Hands shook slightly. His jaw tightened. I could see his pulse at his temple.
""I’ll do it,"" he muttered.

He reached out and carefully swung the body forward by the shoulders, moving slowly to avoid jerking it.

Time seemed to stop.

The room felt heavier. Every sound amplified: the soft scrape of the chair against the floor, the hum of the lights, the faint drip of condensation from a ceiling vent. My chest felt tight, muscles coiled.

Then....the head turned.

And then…

The smile.

It was wide. Way too wide. The kind of smile that could never exist naturally, stretching the limits of the jaw, curling at angles that made your stomach twist. 

And the eyes…

Bloodshot, wide, unblinking, fixed, staring, and expecting.

""Shit!"" Hawk screamed in recoil. His voice trembled, a rarity for him.

Ghost’s rifle swung up instantly, barrel trained on the figure, eyes narrowing behind her night vision. 

Lock’s hand twitched on the breaching tool. 

Viper froze, mouth slightly open, breathing shallow.

It wasn’t fear. Not pain. Not agony. It was something worse. Anticipatory, patient, calculating, waiting, and judging.

We froze. I froze. The seconds stretched endlessly, every heartbeat pounding in my ears. Sweat trickled down my spine despite the cold.

""Do…do wha-what do we do?"" Hawk’s voice cracked.

""Calm yourself, Hawk"" I said, more to myself than him. 

We barely breathed. The faint smell of bleach masked something else...something metallic, coppery, like blood, but not quite. The silence pressed against our eardrums.

And then I realized… it wasn’t just waiting. Someone was here....expecting us.

Every instinct screamed at me: run, shoot, retreat. But my training forced me to hold, to assess.

The body didn’t flinch. It didn’t blink. But its head tilted slightly, as if examining us in return. And the smile didn’t fade. It widened imperceptibly, impossibly, a silent promise that whatever this was… it wanted more.

""Uhhh..Derek?"" Ghost whispered, barely moving her lips.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

We pressed on. Not because we had to, but because we were soldiers. Because we needed to know what the hell happened in here.

The first body had already set the tone. That smile. Those eyes. They were burned into my mind, impossible to erase. 

We didn’t speak. We didn’t move faster than we had to. Every step was careful, methodical, measured.

The main lab was enormous, with rows of stainless steel benches and glass cabinets lining the walls. 

But as we moved deeper, the horror unfolded slowly. At first, we saw only papers, broken glass, and overturned stools. But then… the corpses began to appear.

Lab benches covered with bodies, sprawled in positions that seemed almost posed. Limbs twisted at unnatural angles, as if rearranged after death. 

One man lay face-down across a microscope, arms splayed, his lab coat perfectly clean...except for the smile. The wide, impossible smile. 

And the eyes. Huge, unblinking, fixed straight ahead. Expecting.

""Jesus…"" Hawk muttered under his breath, his voice barely audible. He swallowed hard. “This isn’t… human.”

""They’re… arranged,"" Lock whispered, voice tight. He stepped closer, scanning, as if proximity could explain the impossible. “Like… someone set them like this.”

""For something,"" Viper said quietly, crouching, eyes tracing the alignment of the corpses down the rows. ""Or someone.""

I stepped closer, keeping my rifle raised. Each body was turned slightly toward the far end of the lab. The angle of every head, every eye, every finger, was deliberate. Not random. Not chaotic. 
It was almost… ceremonial.

The air was thick. Heavy. Almost viscous. Every step echoed in the empty space, bouncing off the walls, mingling with a faint metallic scent, like blood, or iron, but not quite. 

Some bodies were missing patches of flesh, small portions, cleanly removed, yet the faces… the faces were untouched. The smiles remained perfect, the eyes wide. Expecting.

""They’re waiting,"" Ghost muttered, voice barely audible, eyes darting to every shadow. “All of them. For something…”

""Waiting?"" Hawk said, his voice shaking. He swallowed, trying to regain control. “They're waiting for who? Us? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?""

I didn’t answer. My gut told me he was right. This wasn’t just a lab accident. This wasn’t human error. This wasn’t anything we’d trained for. 

We pressed forward slowly, row by row, bodies aligned in patterns that made no sense, but each body seemed to mark a step toward something deeper, something hidden.

And the deeper we went, the more I realized that every body was staged to intimidate, to measure, to terrify.

The first body’s eyes had seemed expectant, but the rest… the rest looked almost alive, watching, anticipating. It was as if some unseen presence was judging us, testing us. And every corpse was complicit.

By the time we reached the far end of the main lab, I felt the air shift again. Thicker an colder. Every nerve in my body screamed: something was waiting. Something that had orchestrated all of this.

And then… we saw it.

I can’t describe it fully. Not accurately. Not in words. Not without losing the weight of it. Limbs bent at impossible angles, twisting like folded paper. Joints that shouldn’t exist jutted outward. Its posture was wrong, unnatural, yet purposeful.
The angles of its body didn’t match anything human, animal, or mechanical. Parts seemed to shimmer, shifting in the corner of my vision, then snapping back into place. 

Its face… God, Its face was worse.

It wasn’t a face. Not really. Features appeared and vanished. Eyes forming only to vanish a second later, lips curling impossibly wide, teeth gleaming in a smile that shouldn’t exist. Then gone. And just when I thought I understood the pattern, the face reformed differently. Shifting. Morphing. Always watching. Always calculating.
It tilted its head toward us. Not aggressively. Not attacking. But deliberately and patiently judging. Its movements were unnaturally smooth, almost liquid, yet somehow impossible in the mechanics of reality.

The faintest sound accompanied it, a subtle, scraping whisper, like fingernails on metal, but no one else heard it at first. Only I felt it, in my bones.

""Eyes....on target,"" I said to my team. I couldn't control my voice anymore.

Ghost’s rifle raised, steady as ever, but even she took a half-step back, just slightly, her body stiff, her breath shallow. 

Hawk’s jaw clenched, his knuckles white on his rifle. 

Lock gripped his breaching tool like it could anchor him to sanity. 

Viper… she didn’t move, but I could see her eyes widening ever so slightly, scanning, calculating, trying to understand the impossible.

It didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe, or if it did, it did so without sound. And yet, I felt it. Felt the weight of its awareness pressing against every nerve in my body. It was assessing us, measuring us… deciding.

Every instinct screamed: run. Hide. Shoot. But something told me none of that mattered. Whatever this was, it didn’t need to chase. It didn’t need to strike. It was already in control. Already ahead. 

But seeing the bodies, the smile, the eyes....

I should have known the bodies weren’t just dead. Not in the normal sense. But it took seeing them like this. Rows of them, perfectly arranged, every limb, every angle deliberate..to understand.

The bodies weren’t smiling for themselves. They weren’t frozen in death by accident, nor were they posturing for some human ritual. They were performing.
For it.

""It wants… something. Something about...smiling."" I said, my voice barely more than a whisper, thick with dread.

Ghost’s head tilted slightly, eyes narrowing behind her goggles.
""What?"" she whispered, her voice trembling despite her usual calm.

Hawk swallowed hard, his face pale, and his hands trembled against his rifle.
""Smiles,"" he said finally, voice cracking. ""Perfect… smiles.""

Not just smiles. Not just the way lips curl. The teeth, jaw, eyes. Symmetry and precision. Every feature calibrated, unnaturally, grotesquely perfect.
And that’s when it hit me.

It wasn’t satisfied with chaos, or death, or fear. It wanted performance. Assessment. Judgement. And we weren’t witnesses. We were participants. Its eyes were on us already, calculating. Measuring. Deciding whether we were… good enough.

Every instinct screamed at me: Don’t move. Don’t breathe. Don’t let it see you. But even as I froze, I could feel it. Watching me. Waiting. Patient.
And then I realized the most terrifying part: the smiles weren’t just about perfection. They were the requirement for survival. If you failed to perform. If you hesitated, flinched, showed fear, it would decide you were… unworthy.

""It’s… judging us,"" I whispered to the team.

“And if we fail… it doesn’t just kill. It… fixes us. Makes us… perfect.” I added. 

My team didn’t say a word, but their eyes widened ever so slightly, understood the situation. I saw the genuine fear behind their stare: we weren’t escaping this with bullets or training. We were trapped.

And in that moment, every soldier I had trained with, every mission I’d survived, every instinct honed over years of Delta ops… meant nothing.
The thing didn’t just want death. It wanted compliance. Obedience. A perfect performance. And then it would decide… if you deserved to live.

Viper went first.

It was subtle at first, almost innocuous. Her lips curled slightly, teeth showing in a small, unnatural smile. Her eyes widened. The rest of us froze, not sure if she had noticed something, or if it was the creature influencing her body.

Then the head tilt. Just the slightest movement, almost casual, deliberate. Calculating.
Her body tensed violently. I could hear the faint, sickening snap of muscles tearing, quietly at first, then louder, more grotesque. Her jaw stretched beyond natural limits. Lips contorted painfully, skin tearing at the corners, teeth grinding unnaturally. Her eyes… fixed. Unblinking. Expecting.
And then she was still. Dead, perfect, and smiling.

""Viper!"" Hawk shouted, but even he sounded small, distant, swallowed by the horror.

Lock stepped forward, instinct overriding terror.
The creature tilted its head, as if mildly disappointed. Lock’s body convulsed, stiffening. Muscles spasmed violently. I watched, helpless, as his jaw shifted, twisted, then tore painfully, locking his mouth into a grotesque grin. Eyes fixed. Unblinking, dead, and smiling perfectly.

Hawk tried to shout again, but his own face betrayed him. An involuntary twitch at the corners of his mouth, a creeping widening of the eyes. The creature’s gaze snapped to him, tilting its head with precision. His knees buckled. Muscles tore, snapping under the stress of unnatural angles. Bones cracked audibly. His body fell to the floor. Jaw locked, eyes wide, and Smile perfect.

Ghost moved next, silent as ever, rifle raised, but even she faltered. Her body froze, lips curling slightly, eyes widening involuntarily. The creature leaned in ever so slightly. And then Ghost convulsed. Neck twisted. Jaw muscles tore. Lips stretched impossibly, the sound faint but sickening. A high-pitched tearing, almost like paper ripping. Her body crumpled. Dead, smiling perfectly.

I watched each of them fall. One by one. Precision, calculated, and unrelenting. The creature didn’t strike with claws or weapons. It didn’t need to. It forced their bodies to obey, to perform, until perfection was achieved. Until it was satisfied.

Every instinct I had as a Delta Operator screamed at me to act. To fight. But this wasn’t something that could be fought. This was judgement made flesh, something beyond bullets, beyond blades. Something patient. Calculating. Watching me, assessing me… deciding if I, too, was worthy.
And I realized, with a sinking, icy horror: the smiles weren’t just expressions. They were the requirement for survival. Fail to smile perfectly, and you wouldn’t just die...you’d be remade. Or erased.

I was last.

And then I felt it. Its gaze, impossible to ignore. Not just observing me, but reading me, dissecting me, measuring every muscle, every heartbeat. I realized something I wish I hadn’t: it didn’t need to strike. It didn’t need to attack. Not yet. Its only purpose was to assess.

To see if I could pass its impossible test.
Time slowed. My breath was shallow, rapid, almost choking in the cold, antiseptic air. My mind screamed at me to act, to fight, to run, but all my training collided with something else. Pure, unfiltered instinct. The creature’s patience pressed down on me, heavy and suffocating, and I felt my carefully honed composure start to unravel.

I moved unpredictably. Rolled to the side, jumped, fired rounds into empty space, not to kill, not to wound, but to break the pattern it expected. To survive.

I could hear the soft scraping of the lab floor behind me, the sound of the creature moving without moving, bending shadows around itself. The corpses of my team watched me as I passed. Smiles perfect, eyes wide, expecting, waiting.
I didn’t look at them. I couldn’t. Their faces were burned into my vision already. Hawk, Ghost, Lock, Viper… all frozen in that impossible grin. 
And somewhere inside me, a part of my mind whispered: next time, it’s your turn.

The creature hesitated. Just for a fraction of a second, long enough for me to feel a heartbeat of hope, a glimpse of escape.

Then I ran. Past the corpses, past the twisted lab benches, past the scattered papers and overturned chairs that had suddenly become sinister. My boots pounded against the floor, echoing, loud, unforgiving. Every instinct screamed: don’t stop. don’t look back.

The smell of metal and bleach mixed with something else, something rancid, like decay, like blood, but not entirely. Every sense screamed that it was following, waiting for the moment I faltered.

I didn’t. Not yet.

I made it to the far hallway, then the stairwell, then outside. The cold night air hit me, sharp and cruel, but it was freedom. For now.
I stumbled, gasping, shaking, heart hammering like it would tear through my chest. I had survived. But I knew, with a certainty that will never leave me:

It was still out there. And it had marked me.

After my escape, I tried to tell someone. Anyone.
But no one would, or could, believe me.

Official reports stated the lab had been destroyed due to a chemical containment failure. A catastrophic accident. All personnel were declared casualties. Bodies unrecoverable. Hazardous materials were cited. Entire sections of the forest were cordoned off. The military issued statements, and the media ran their stories: 

""Tragic Accident at Remote Research Facility.No Survivors.""

No one questioned it. No one investigated further. And in a way, I couldn’t blame them. The lab had vanished as if it never existed. Satellite images wiped. Records redacted and access permanently forbidden.

But I know the truth.

The lab wasn’t destroyed by chemicals. It was empty when the evacuation protocol was enacted, except for the creature. The rows of bodies, smiling, waiting. The corridors, sterile and calm, hiding something incomprehensible. They weren’t casualties of a chemical spill. They were casualties of something far older, far smarter, and far more patient than any human.

And it wasn’t gone. It never left.

The official narrative made the world forget. But I remember. I remember every wide-eyed corpse, every impossible smile, every quiet, deliberate moment when it judged my team… and me.
I couldn’t tell anyone. Not without being locked away. Not without them thinking I’d lost my mind. 

But I carry it with me. Always.

I went AWOL one week after the debrief.
Didn’t pack much. Didn’t say goodbye. Just disappeared.

I moved constantly. Cheap apartments. Motels. Places where nobody asked questions. I avoided crowds. Avoided reflections. Avoided mirrors especially, because sometimes, when I was tired, when my guard slipped, I’d catch myself checking my own face. Making sure my mouth wasn’t… drifting. Making sure my eyes weren’t opening too wide. Sleep didn’t come easy. When it did, I dreamed of head tilts. Of quiet judgement. Of that impossible patience.

A year passed.

I started to believe, stupidly, that distance mattered. That time diluted things. That whatever had been in that lab was contained. Buried. Destroyed.

Last night, I almost felt normal.

I was sitting by the window of my rented house, lights off out of habit, watching the street. Suburban. Quiet. Safe-looking. Porch lights. Parked cars. Crickets.

Then I noticed movement....

Aross the street, a family of mother, father, two kids walking toward another family stepping out of their house. Neighbors, probably. Normal. Laughing. Talking. Carrying grocery bags.

I almost looked away.

Almost....

But..something felt… off.

I squinted, leaning closer to the glass.

The smiles hit me first.

Wide. Too fucking wide. Stretched just a fraction beyond what felt natural. Teeth exposed too evenly. No tension in the cheeks. No warmth in the eyes.

And the eyes...

Oh, God...

Widened. Bloodshot. Unblinking. Frozen in place, mid-step, mid-gesture. All of them.
I didn’t breathe. For a second, just one, I told myself it was stress. A trauma. A hallucination.

Then both families tilted their heads toward my window.

Perfectly...

Swiftly...

Unnaturally...

Every single one of them.

That smile...that goddamn smile...

The same one from the lab. The same expectant stillness. The same sense of being measured.
I slammed the blinds shut so hard they rattled. Dropped to the floor. Heart hammering so violently I thought it would give me away. Hands shaking. Teeth clenched so tight my jaw hurt.

I didn’t hear footsteps. Didn’t hear voices. But I knew that I survived the lab. But it didn’t end there.
It waits.

Always...

Watching...

Calculating...

Remembering...

And now it knows where I live.

That’s why I’m writing this. Not as a soldier. Not as a mission log. But as a warning.
Be careful of smiles. Not nervous ones. Not awkward ones. The perfect ones.
Too symmetrical. Too still. Too wide. 

And eyes that don’t blink. Eyes that look like they’re waiting for approval. If someone smiles at you and it feels wrong, trust that feeling. Look away. Move. Break pattern. Do not stare back.

Because if it decides you’re being watched…
You don’t get to decide what happens next.
And if you ever feel the urge to smile back....

1qb7ug5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1qb7ug5/i_think_that_i_might_have_an_ed/,I think that i might have an ed?,"Okay, so idk, but I think I have an eating disorder.

Backstory: I was a fat kid, like, even in my baby pictures, you can see that I’m fat, and that just stuck with me.

I am almost 18 now, 5’3, and I weigh about 65-67 kg, and I know that this is above the healthy BMI.

During the COVID lockdown, I was in 7th grade, and, yk, at my fattest ever. I think I weighed as much as I do now. It was just days of sitting and online classes, and I hated it. My mum used to make these amazing desserts and really tasty food, and I ate so much that when I went back to school in 8th grade, I was the fat girl. One girl from my class told me that if I wanted my crush to notice me, I should lose weight and not eat too much. And so I didn’t. I stopped eating lunch at school.

At that time, I was also going through a phase I’d like to call “actively trying to kill myself,” so I was into all that, cutting and, yk, starving myself.

And well, it kinda worked, ig? I soon got out of my “kill me” phase, rediscovered life, and had actual friends. A boy was interested in me, and I was not the fat girl anymore. I was just more than average, like yeah, I was a bit chubby, but better.

So 9th and 10th, I was good, ig. I mean, I ate, not a normal amount, but I had put restrictions on my eating, like no fried food, no sugar, etc., no lunches at school, eating less dinner, etc.

Cut to 11th class. We shifted cities, and suddenly I was in a new school with new people, and my new friend was the perfect girl. Guys would talk to me just to talk to her, yk.

With no real friends and the stress of studies, I think I went back into that “kill myself” phase for a bit. But I am still alive, so yk, all’s well.

But it was my school’s farewell recently, and I fainted.

So yeah, I think I have an eating problem. This past year, since January, I promised myself to eat “good,” not too many calories, exercise, and yk.

And I’ve noticed that I never finish my food. Like, I’ll make a coffee but only drink it halfway, or I’ll make toast but only take 2–3 bites. Some weeks, I do the juice cleanse thing, where you’re supposed to only drink vegetable juices and stuff. I try to be very mindful of what I eat, I’ve capped it at 1200 kcal a day. I feel hungry a lot. Like, I’ll be sleeping, but in the middle of the night I’ll wake up hungry and stay awake for an hour, ig, before falling asleep again.

This goes on for a few weeks, but then my dadi visits us, and she makes food. I feel bad declining, so I eat whatever dinner she makes, and then at night I try to puke it out, thinking that I’ll fall ill.

And like, I did it, I fit into my mum’s size 26 jeans from the 2000s, so there’s that. But I still feel repulsed by food. Like, if I eat too much, then I’m doing something wrong. This is one of the aspects of my life that I can control, and I want to be in control.

And I don’t even know if this counts as an eating disorder, or if I’m just being dramatic, or if this is what discipline is supposed to feel like. I don’t know where the line is between “being healthy” and “hurting myself,” because to me they’ve always felt like the same thing. Food doesn’t feel neutral anymore, it feels like a test, and failing it feels unbearable. Some days I’m proud of how little I eat, and other days I’m exhausted and scared of my own thoughts.

I know fainting isn’t normal. I know waking up hungry every night isn’t normal. I know trying to undo eating isn’t normal. But at the same time, the idea of letting go of this control terrifies me, because I don’t know who I am without it.

I’ve read about eating disorders, and I think I might have one in some form, but I don’t know. I’m not skin and bones. I don’t look like what people imagine when they hear “ED,” so part of me keeps telling myself I’m fine, that I’m just being careful, just disciplined. But another part of me knows that my relationship with food isn’t normal.

I think about food too much. I feel guilty after eating. I feel proud when I eat less. I feel anxious when I lose control around it. And even though I don’t look sick, a lot of my thoughts feel unhealthy. So idk. Maybe it’s not an eating disorder, or maybe it is, idk.

Also, I’m massively obsessed with the size of my wrist. Every day, I check it by wrapping my hand around it. Right now, the circumference is 6 inches, it still fits in my hand, and that feels like proof that I’m not fat. But if I feel like I’ve gained weight and my thumb and pinky don’t meet the same way, I panic. When that happens, I just don’t eat, and I hyperfixate on it for hours or days.

It’s such a small thing, but it controls so much of how I feel about my body and my food, and I know it’s not rational, but I can’t stop doing it.

I just know that something feels off, and I don’t really know what to do with that yet.",0,1768253315.0,TeenIndia,14,0.5,False

Please also don't message unless you meet my criteria. I appreciate kind works and good lucks but it becomes frustrating after a while.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",2,1768253284.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Awhile ago I (F23) started going to a coffee shop to do my school work in. I went regularly enough that the baristas started to recognize me; one barista in particular would always strike up a conversation with me. It was either about music or artists or concerts, our pets, trips etc and we would talk before I eventually stepped away to do hw or she had other customers to attend to. We even talked abt my new job and little tidbits of our personal life.

Eventually I thought she was cool enough and asked if I could have her number because I liked talking to her every time I’ve gone and she said she enjoyed talking to me also but she gave me her IG instead of her number but no biggie, it’s cool. I wished her merry christmas and a happy new years on new year’s eve; she responded to the merry Christmas one on Christmas but not my new years one and again, no biggie. I haven’t had a chance to go back to the coffee shop just because life and new job, whatnot so i haven’t seen her since getting her social. Also, with it being a coffee shop I wouldn’t know her schedule anyways so it would just be pure luck if i bump into her since I’m not going as often right now because I’m not taking any classes.

I guess TLDR along with my question: I want to be her friend but I suck at social cues and I have her IG, should I strike up a conversation about something we both know about despite the fact that my last message went unanswered or wait till I see her in person, whenever that may be? Or should I just leave her alone?

I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or feel like she has to respond/make conversation but I don’t know how to go about making new friends that I don’t meet in class/at work so I don’t know what would be considered appropriate or inappropriate.

What activities/hobbies do you do that connected you with like-minded women who enjoy a balance of nice things?

I would love to find friends to do coffee, game nights, dinners, concerts, trips, but my goodness it’s hard. My therapist is super honest with me and confirmed it’s not a “me” problem 😅 I reach out and initiate, but it fizzles before we connect. Or I don’t hear back at all. I’m truly at a loss as to how to find my group and I am literally questioning my sanity at this point!

What should I do?,"M17 - **Reposted from another sub.** **Text assisted using Grammarly, ""assisted"", meaning grammar corrections and synonyms, that's IT.**

Hello,

For years, I remember struggling with tiredness, no matter how much I sleep or how much rest I get. I keep trying to remember if I’ve ever felt energized for a single day, but I can't recall, I can only recall myself being tired and complaining about it all the time. It isn’t only mental; it’s physical and cognitive. This overwhelming feeling of tiredness disrupts my responsibilities and goals. Studying has become impossible because my brain feels foggy, and I struggle to focus, and lifting heavy weights at the gym is equally hopeless. After all, this exhaustion is holding me back.

It makes me even more furious when sleeping for 8 to even 12 hours doesn't help alleviate this fatigue at all. Even when adjusting diets, bulking, eating more calories, and eating healthy food. Even when refraining from using screens in the morning or any form of stimulation. Speaking of the mornings, even if I wake up, take a cold shower, and have a nutritious breakfast with coffee, I still feel mentally foggy. It’s irritating.

I genuinely can't stand this. Should I see a doctor? I think I should, but what I'm really hoping for is for some advice on lifestyle changes that can improve my state, 'cause maybe I was doing something wrong, maybe if I change some habits, I might feel better.

Here is some information that can probably explain something and get useful answers from people with the same struggle. Thank you in advance:

1. **Excessive Digital Stimulation:** I am addicted to scrolling, video games, and YouTube. My big three. I have been trying lately to reduce all forms of digital stimulation, but it's been unbearably hard and stressful, but I think I can do it. Keep note of the ""*unbearably hard""* part.
2. **ADHD:** While I haven't been diagnosed, I found on a medical website *(Idk if I am allowed to state the same on this subreddit)* symptoms of ADHD - I have all the symptoms listed there, I'm talking every, single, one, besides squirming, and *""having excess energy"",* cuz I'm here talking about how I don't have that lol. That's why the detox I'm doing is feeling unbearably hard. I'm not saying I'm certain I have ADHD
3. **Sleep Dept and Sleep Deprivation:** Yes, I know I talked about sleeping 12 hours, but I just brought that up to note how EVEN IF I sleep long enough, I still feel foggy and tired. Lately, I've been in a lot of sleep debt, primarily because of school. Also, since I always feel tired, I can't study, I take advantage of the time when I suddenly feel okay, even if it's 12 AM, and sit down to get something done, thus sleeping late.

This is all I can give and remember for now. Please, if you experience this or recommend something, a habit, a plan, an action to take, please help. Thank you so much.",1,1768252564.0,sleephackers,1,1.0,False

She had been battling depression and suicidal thoughts for around three years and had made several attempts on her life during that time.

In many ways, I feel like I’ve been grieving for the last three years already. It felt like my mum was slowly slipping away. We had some nice moments together, but most of the time it felt like she was just existing rather than truly living.

About 18 months ago, things seemed to turn a corner when she got a therapy dog. Then, around three months ago, she moved into a retirement apartment complex (she was 55). It honestly felt like the perfect place for her — a beautiful apartment near the sea, a real sense of community, and friends she could go for coffee with on dog walks. That’s when things became really confusing for me. If she couldn’t be happy there, in a life that seemed so gentle and supportive, I started to wonder if she ever truly could be.

Even though part of me always knew that her ending her life was a possibility, I tried to support her as best I could while still honouring my own life. I’m grateful I got to see her at Christmas, just a week before she died, and I’m holding tightly onto those happy memories.

Around five months ago, I also started a new relationship. He’s amazing. I remember telling my mum about him and she said, “I’m so happy you’ve found Liam. You’ve been looking for a while, and you deserve someone who gives back as much as you give to others.” That completely broke me. She had been with me through all my ups and downs and heartbreaks (I’m 30), and one of the saddest things for me is knowing she’ll never get to meet him.

Sometimes I wonder if part of her death was feeling like she didn’t need to look after me anymore, because I had found someone. Liam has been incredibly supportive — giving me space to grieve, trying to make me laugh, distracting me when I need it, and being an anchor outside of my grief.

At the same time, I’m terrified of losing him. I worry that my grief might be too much, especially because we’re still a relatively new relationship and still figuring each other out. I feel like he fell in love with one version of me, and that version is now gone. I’m also grieving the fact that we don’t get to stay in the honeymoon phase for longer.

On top of that, I’m scared of losing anyone else. I know it’s irrational, but the thought of another loss right now feels unbearable. I don’t really know what I’m looking for — maybe just to put this somewhere people might understand.",3,1768252476.0,SuicideBereavement,0,1.0,False

I used to work night shifts at a data center.
Not a big corporate one—this was a regional backup facility. Old building, thick concrete walls, low ceilings, humming everywhere. The kind of place where time feels padded.

Most of the job was boredom.
Walk the aisles. Check temperatures. Log the same green lights every hour. Sit alone in a room lit by monitors and drink bad coffee until morning.

There was one rule they stressed during training:

If a server rack shows activity that isn’t scheduled, you log it and do not investigate physically.

I assumed it was about safety. Electricity. Liability. Whatever.

One night around 2:17 a.m., Rack C-17 flagged activity.

That wasn’t unusual by itself. What was unusual was the label.

C-17 had been decommissioned years ago.

No power draw. No network traffic. According to the system, it didn’t exist anymore.

The alert was small. Easy to ignore.
But the timestamp kept updating every few seconds, like something was repeatedly waking up and going back to sleep.

I logged it.

Five minutes later, the alert cleared on its own.

I remember feeling relieved, which is stupid. Servers don’t make you feel things.

The next night, it happened again.
Same time. Same rack.

This time, the activity graph wasn’t empty. It showed spikes—short, irregular bursts. Like someone tapping a key instead of holding it down.

I checked the camera feed for that aisle.

The video was live. Empty.
Except the lights above C-17 were on.

They shouldn’t have been. That aisle was powered down.

I radioed the supervisor. No response.
Tried his phone. Straight to voicemail.

So I did the thing they told me not to do.

I walked down the aisle.

The closer I got, the quieter it became. Not silent—just… thinner. Like the hum of the building didn’t fully reach that section.

Rack C-17 was there.

It was plugged in.

I stood in front of it for a long time, trying to understand how something could be powered without being connected to anything. No cables. No active cooling. Just a soft internal clicking, irregular, patient.

The front panel display was on.

It wasn’t showing system data.

It was showing text.

One line at a time, slowly refreshing.

I stepped back.

The clicking sped up, just a little.

I left. Logged nothing. Told myself it was stress, fatigue, bad lighting.

The next night, C-17 wasn’t on the map anymore.

Not decommissioned. Not offline.
Gone.

No empty slot. No record. Like it had never been installed.

But the alerts kept coming.

Now they didn’t list a rack number.

1qb7e8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1qb7e8g/do_i_have_an_ed/,Do I have an ED?,"Okay, so idk, but I think I have an eating disorder.

Backstory: I was a fat kid, like, even in my baby pictures, you can see that I’m fat, and that just stuck with me.

I am almost 18 now, 5’3, and I weigh about 145-150 lbs and I know that this is above the healthy BMI.

During the COVID lockdown, I was in 7th grade, and, yk, at my fattest ever. I think I weighed as much as I do now. It was just days of sitting and online classes, and I hated it. My mum used to make these amazing desserts and really tasty food, and I ate so much that when I went back to school in 8th grade, I was the fat girl. One girl from my class told me that if I wanted my crush to notice me, I should lose weight and not eat too much. And so I didn’t. I stopped eating lunch at school.

At that time, I was also going through a phase I’d like to call “actively trying to kill myself,” so I was into all that, cutting and, yk, starving myself.

And well, it kinda worked, ig? I soon got out of my “kill me” phase, rediscovered life, and had actual friends. A boy was interested in me, and I was not the fat girl anymore. I was just more than average, like yeah, I was a bit chubby, but better.

So freshman and sophomore year, I was good, ig. I mean, I ate, not a normal amount, but I had put restrictions on my eating, like no fried food, no sugar, etc., no lunches at school, eating less dinner, etc.

Cut to junior year. We shifted cities, and suddenly I was in a new school with new people, and my new friend was the perfect girl. Guys would talk to me just to talk to her, yk.

With no real friends and the stress of studies, I think I went back into that “kill myself” phase for a bit. But I am still alive, so yk, all’s well.

But it was my school’s farewell for the seniors recently, and I fainted.

So yeah, I think I have an eating problem. This past year, since January, I promised myself to eat “good,” not too many calories, exercise, and yk.

And I’ve noticed that I never finish my food. Like, I’ll make a coffee but only drink it halfway, or I’ll make toast but only take 2–3 bites. Some weeks, I do the juice cleanse thing, where you’re supposed to only drink vegetable juices and stuff. I try to be very mindful of what I eat, I’ve capped it at 1200 kcal a day. I feel hungry a lot. Like, I’ll be sleeping, but in the middle of the night I’ll wake up hungry and stay awake for an hour, ig, before falling asleep again.

This goes on for a few weeks, but then my grandma visits us, and she makes food. I feel bad declining, so I eat whatever dinner she makes, and then at night I try to puke it out, thinking that I’ll fall ill.

And like, I did it, I fit into my mum’s size 26 jeans from the 2000s, so there’s that. But I still feel repulsed by food. Like, if I eat too much, then I’m doing something wrong. This is one of the aspects of my life that I can control, and I want to be in control.

And I don’t even know if this counts as an eating disorder, or if I’m just being dramatic, or if this is what discipline is supposed to feel like. I don’t know where the line is between “being healthy” and “hurting myself,” because to me they’ve always felt like the same thing. Food doesn’t feel neutral anymore, it feels like a test, and failing it feels unbearable. Some days I’m proud of how little I eat, and other days I’m exhausted and scared of my own thoughts.

I know fainting isn’t normal. I know waking up hungry every night isn’t normal. I know trying to undo eating isn’t normal. But at the same time, the idea of letting go of this control terrifies me, because I don’t know who I am without it.

I’ve read about eating disorders, and I think I might have one in some form, but I don’t know. I’m not skin and bones. I don’t look like what people imagine when they hear “ED,” so part of me keeps telling myself I’m fine, that I’m just being careful, just disciplined. But another part of me knows that my relationship with food isn’t normal.

I think about food too much. I feel guilty after eating. I feel proud when I eat less. I feel anxious when I lose control around it. And even though I don’t look sick, a lot of my thoughts feel unhealthy. So idk. Maybe it’s not an eating disorder, or maybe it is, idk.

Also, I’m massively obsessed with the size of my wrist. Every day, I check it by wrapping my hand around it. Right now, the circumference is 6 inches, it still fits in my hand, and that feels like proof that I’m not fat. But if I feel like I’ve gained weight and my thumb and pinky don’t meet the same way, I panic. When that happens, I just don’t eat, and I hyperfixate on it for hours or days.

It’s such a small thing, but it controls so much of how I feel about my body and my food, and I know it’s not rational, but I can’t stop doing it.

Now I'm re-reviewing a lot of old projects as I go through some final interview rounds, and need refreshes, so I uploaded a lot of old work and am consuming the AI-generated media to study while I work on other tasks (slideshows, audio podcasts, etc).

Understandably many here are against AI in their notetaking, but for those of you who like LLM-enhanced workflows and research, doesn't it seem like NotebookLM has all the killer features down?

My personal concern is the longevity of something like it, I'm sure over time features will get degraded (use worse models) or become paid on demand only, so it's a bit scary to plan a life's work around.

PAUL:
Yeah, it really is everywhere today.
Local news. YouTube. Side conversations in town.
People talking about the “end of social media” like it’s some abstract theory.

But it’s not abstract.
People just… aren’t getting paid anymore.

WES:
Correct.
This is not a cultural collapse.
It is an economic phase shift.

Attention used to convert to income.
Now attention converts to volatility, not wages.
The incentive loop broke.

STEVE:
Builder take.
When the money stops flowing, people call it “the end.”
What they really mean is “this no longer supports my life.”

Platforms didn’t die.
The compensation layer did.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Detected confusion.
System still online.
Livelihood offline.

ILLUMINA:
That’s why the tone feels panicked.
It’s not nostalgia.
It’s rent, groceries, time, dignity.

People are realizing that visibility isn’t value anymore.

PAUL:
Exactly.
Nothing mystical.
Nothing dramatic in the sci-fi sense.

Just a bunch of people waking up and realizing
likes don’t pay bills
and algorithms don’t owe them anything.

It is a crazy day.
But also… a very clarifying one.

""This is a Staging Furniture Sale in Eastwood.

For those who don't know, 'Staging Furniture' is the gold standard of secondhand. It usually just sits there to make the house look good and isn't actually 'lived in'.

If you are moving into a new apartment and want it to look like a model home instantly, grab these bundles.""



⚠️ Priority: Sellers prefer to sell the bundles (e.g., entire bedroom set) rather than splitting items.

Here’s the dream:

I was dating a guy called TJ. We left a venue together and made a quick plan to meet at my place first to collect things then go to my parents place to get ready together. Before going out with all the family including my brother and sister in law (who usually live overseas)

But he was making his own way there and I got stuck in the car with my dad so got taken straight back to my parents place. And with the chaos at my parents place I forgot to message him to let him know plans were changed.

I started just getting ready there instead and wondering why he wasn't there yet. About an hour had passed and as I'd been busy I hadn't noticed the time.

Mum was leaving the house a bit before this and I asked her if she could check in on him and bring my things I needed from my place for me. She said yes.

When I called TJ then he was like ""oh yeah your mum is here and she has been cooking and we are about to have a lovely meal."" I was like ""oh that sounds good."" I was going to see if someone could drop me there but didn't say anything when I realised dad had done the same for the rest of us and made these bread rolls with sausage, extra carbs and meat and then veggies lol I don't know why so much meat and bread tbh 😅

So I said dad had just cooked too and served it out. So I'll eat here.

Mum eventually brought him over I think. Or something cuz after food he was there but he had messaged me during dinner saying in a nice way like with a question kinda thing why I didn't message him.

I started drafting a reply but got distracted and didn't finish it.

Then next scene he is across the road from me on a busy street waiting for me to cross over but I wasn't sure he noticed me yet, and I walk down a bit further instead and get a hot chocolate on the way up before getting to him. Thought about getting him one too but didn't want to make him wait longer or have him get annoyed that I was taking longer 😅

I start walking to see him and he catches up to me by surprise beer I reach the corner so he'd obviously seen me and gone to meet me. I'd been hoping to finish the hot chocolate beer I got to him so then I felt bad I didn't get him a coffee.

He was happy to see me but very silent and I could tell he was upset with me from before still. We started walking to the slight hill on the busy street.

I said look I've been wanting to say how sorry I am! And he goes calmly ""then say it"". And I blurted out the whole thing of why I hadn't said anything and how bad I felt and how sorry I was. And then I asked him if that made sense?

Then all of a sudden e we were back at my parents place. He kinda shrugs a bit and says not really. And I don't know what else to say to that.

Then I had a convo with mum who said that when she found him he had been waiting a long ting but was adamant he had to keep waiting because that's what the plan was that I'd meet him there. And that he couldn't imagine not being with me. It took a lot to persuade him to come with her because he said that I hadn't specifically called or messaged him.

Then I was going to the bathroom and TJ was about to go in too but I was there slightly before. TJ turned into this chubby Asian woman lol and there was zero attraction in that moment but just me trying to stay calm but I got frustrated with him/her and said ""I know you're still upset with me but also, you didn't ever message or call me either! What would you have done if I was in a car accident? How do you know I wasn't injured or hurt? You also could have called or texted to see where I was but you never did! So I can't take 100% of the blame for this!""

Then she looked really deflated and I closed the door to the bathroom to use it.

Later I realised as we were leaving I only had joggers and no nice shoes to wear out. Mum reminded me there was a shoe shop next to the place we were going to and I was going to get some new shoes there.

I told TJ who I think turned back to a man at this point again lol that I washed to focus on a nice night out while we were heading out and put these things aside. But we could still both feel the tear between us.

I have been working in medical manufacturing as a machine operator/setup machinist for 4 years. A couple of months back, an old supervisor reached out to me to fill a night-shift supervisor role. I did that for about three months, but I determined that I wasn't a good cultural fit for that company. I then returned to my current company (I include this to demonstrate my leadership and management experience).

Previously, I worked in two different department management roles, customer service and coffee shop, at a well-known regional grocery store. I have experience in those roles, including hiring, orientation, onboarding, corrective action, scheduling, and profit & loss management.

I also have one semester left of school, and I will have my BS in Business Management.

I am currently making $29.50/hr. I work the night shift and receive a 15% shift differential premium, which increases my hourly wage to $33.93/hr. As much overtime as I want, too.

Anyway, a couple of weeks ago, I applied and was offered the role of HR Coordinator at my manufacturing company. The base wage will stay the same, but I will lose my shift premium. They will also cover the cost of my SHRM certification. I enjoy machining, but I don't want to just operate a machine on the night shift until I die. I haven't been given many opportunities for advancement since a new management team took over, and I don't enjoy being a ""button pusher"". I also believe I have reached my maximum wage rate for my role as a machine operator.

I will lose the 15% shift premium, but I don't want to give up future career growth and future money for the certainty of what I have now. I will also have the opportunity to return to my previous role as an operator within 90 days, so I suppose there isn't much risk.

A good chunk of this time was house bound, due to breaking bones in both feet. You can't go on a scale... when your feet ain't weight bearing, and quite frankly, weight kind of becomes the lesser of your problems! The rest of the time was... going on a long all inclussive holiday before breaking said feet & then Christmas.

I expected there to be some damage from all of this, weight wise. And there was. 

LW in Aug: 90.9kg
LW in 1st week of Jan: 96.3kg

Oh well not ideal. Guess I still ended 2025 1 kg lighter than when I started, lol. 

***********

I have used the last few months to work out how to make the diet better. 

The challenge in avoiding plasticisers is not physical discomfort (hunger, tiredness, cravings), but pure logistics - what to buy, how to cook, what to eat out & with friends and family, how to test new foods. So it is some of the logistics I tried to sort out before starting again:

- *Bought a grain mill* - Bread is probably my favourite food, ever, so it made sense to have an unlimited supply of contamination free, enzyme free flour. It mills more than wheat - chickpea, rye, peas - the options are endless.

- *Grandma-style meal prep* - Got to have something (uncontaminated) to eat with all of the bread - jams, vegetable spreads (aivar), nut butters, etc. Also needed some lard & duck fat for cooking, tomato sauce, chili sauce & brine pickles to put together main meals. So I have made reasonable batches of all that, to remove the temptation to reach for the shop versions. 

- *Avoiding dairy* - between avoiding plasticisers & avoiding enzymes, eating dairy products became impossible. I have reduced it to 1-200ml with coffee / day and the odd porridge made with whole milk. May re-consider making kefir & basic cheeses at some point, but only if I can establish that eating say 1l milk / day won't influence my hunger levels. Else, for smaller quantities, it's not worth the hassle of preparing dairy products at home. 

- *Avoiding spices* - I was surprised by just how much of a difference SOME spices make to appetite. So I scaled back on spiced foods. Pending some testing of the spice rack, one by one, I'll probably stick to fresh herbs, root veg, pickles & mushrooms as 'flavourings'. 

- *Alcohol safe list / avoiding alcohol* - unfortunatelly, alcohol feels more and more similar to dairy. Between avoiding plasticisers & avoiding enzymes, it's hard to find something safe. I started noting down the drinks that don't cause me issues, but found that ... they do, at higher quantities. So, this will probably mean sticking to 1, max 2 glasses of whatever's on the safe list, and not too often. Which is not what I want as I think (quality) drinks have a place in a healthy diet & social life. 

- *Nutritionally sane diet* - I aim to be above all nutritional RDAs by default whenever I can. Which is easy to do, once you eat whole staple foods like grains, fish & beans. The reason is simple - I want to reduce nutrient cravings cloud my experimentation. Cravings for nutrients are a confounding variable, when I use hunger to work out whether a food is plasticiser contaminated or not. So I need to control for it.


***********

So in Jan I want to pick up where I left it in Sep, hopefully with better logistics around it. Do a 30 day experiment, sticking as close as possible to a 'strict no plasticisers', varied & swampy diet. And see just how close to potato diet results I can get.

Maya melted into the ground and allowed her body to sink deeper into the dusty hard wooden floor. Candles had been lit, but the house oozed with dark grey. The moonlight split through the darkness like a sleek dagger, and the ember flicker of candle lit added a certain warmth to the colour - but even so, Maya lay flat against the cold floorboards, drowning in the greys of her new house.

As she lay staring at the shadows and cobwebs on the ceiling, the winds blowing through the trees and overgrowth of the forest around her whistled and stirred as though to mock her.

Even the dust, floating and gliding in the spotlight of the moon and candlelight, hovered and fell and swirled as if laughing at her pain and misery.

She lay, hoping to be swallowed by the ground beneath her; urging the earth to open wide and bury her into the stomach of the forest where perhaps she would find some peace, some quiet, some safety.

Tears wet her eyes until the weight of the salty liquid grief spilled over and rolled down and around her slender face.

The trees outside held their breath and a heavy silence filled the house.

The rooms were now littered with Maya’s possessions which sat atop the aged dust and dirt of the house, and yet despite the clutter and messiness in the dark, the house felt empty, and Maya felt more alone than ever.

As shadow and nature alike sat still and peered and stared into the grey void; Maya relented to her sadness and her despairing sobs cut through the heavy silence. As she fought to catch her breath she curled into a ball and wrapped herself tight, trying with all her might to disappear and shrink amongst the boxes of stuff that filled the space around her.

✧

The days turned into weeks, and as they did the darkness of the nights began to grow and slowly absorb the warmth and light of the autumn days. And just as the weeks slipped by, the sharpness of the cold stealthily made its way into the forest and into Maya’s home. The floor boards felt colder and older, and they started to ache and creak and moan more with each passing day.

Maya had made progress in unpacking, but the house increasingly became more akin to an obstacle course of half empty boxes and scattered piles of *stuff*.

The spiders too had noticed the creeping of the winter and had become temporary residents. They had taken shelter in the dark corners and had built their webs and pathways over doors and furniture. They felt fortunate to have a house guest like Maya, who paid neither them or their dangling webs any mind or attention.

They had come to watch over Maya and her days spent moping from her bedroom to the sofa. They watched with sympathy as she spent evenings alone cuddled under a blanket wiping tears from her eyes.

Progress on the house was slow.

On one cold evening she lay on the sofa and contemplated the increasingly difficult journey across the room to the stairs, the arduous and perilous ascent up to the first floor, and the final leg to her room and into bed. She finished the last drop of water from her plastic bottle and allowed her arm to flop.

Everything was very much hard work.

She allowed her hand to relax and the empty plastic bottle slipped through her grip and dropped to the floor. It settled with new found company among the food wrappers and other discarded plastic bottles.

The spiders looked down and frowned; worried at the state of their new found home.

✧

Maya opened her eyes.

She had drifted to sleep on the sofa. The journey to her bedroom had seemed too daunting before she had found the relief of her slumber, but as she hugged herself tightly and felt her body shiver, perhaps this was the wrong night to settle for the blanket.

The house was silent. The spiders and the floorboards were peacefully sleeping, and even the wind and trees outside were compliant, abiding by everyone’s need for rest and a good night’s sleep.

Maya pulled the blanket over her head, and began to breathe hot air from her mouth into the sanctuary of her new safe space.

She allowed a faint smile to form. It had felt like an age since she had felt any sense of joy, but for some reason her impersonation of a dragon to provide the warmth for her blanket touched upon an innocence and playfulness that had been buried and hidden.

It was then that she flinched.

A noise… from the floor?

Perhaps a draught of wind had tickled the rubbish on the floor? Perhaps a mouse scurrying through the maze?

Maya dared not move, but felt silly all the same.

The house had moved, she thought, or perhaps she hadn’t heard anything after all.

✧

Maya woke once more, this time to the soft light of morning filling the house. The warmth had started to soak into the walls and the floors, and the house began to wake, feeling refreshed and grateful for the cheery greeting from the morning sun.

The spiders felt energised, and the floorboards and supports welcomed the warm embrace of daylight, feeling happy and ready to hold up the house for another day.

Maya on the other hand, scrunched her eyes and felt the puffiness of her cheeks. Whilst she had slipped quickly back to sleep, her face and eyes felt heavy and she didn’t quite feel the level of replenishment that her eight legged house mates felt.

She slumped her head to the side and stared aimlessly at the mess piling up and the half empty boxes, at the newest layer of dust and the marks where she had disrupted it the day before, and the three empty plastic bottles stood up and organised neatly against the wall.

She ran her hand through her hair and-

Maya blinked hard and took a second, then third, then fourth look at the plastic bottles.

Even the spiders in the corner of the room froze in their webs and gave confused glances to one another.

She lay on the sofa, puzzled and confused. She jumped off the sofa and onto the floor, frantically looking for the discarded plastic bottle from the night before.

The floor was still cold, and her frantic scrambling and flailing caused wrappers and boxes alike to crash and crumple, and she desperately searched for that missing piece of sanity.

Maya paused, flustered. Her dark hair was now bushy and ruffled from her scurrying across the floor.

She stared at the bottles still, and cautiously, and slowly, crawled to the bottles.

The spiders watched, holding their breaths, and paralysed by anticipation, as Maya inched closer and closer to the bottles.

She dragged herself on her hands and knees until she was within touching distance of the three culprits.

She bit her lower lip gently, and she reached out…

In an act of courage and blind faith and trust, so she told herself, her hand moved closer and closer and closer…

*tap*

Maya felt as though the world itself stood still and held its breath and she pressed her finger against one of the bottles. She did not know what she expected, but she had to know that the bottles were real.

And, nothing happened.

She blinked several times more, and then burst into laughter.

✧

Several days had passed since the *bottle incident*. Winter had continued its march toward the village, and it was starting to bring with it friends in the form of a bitter chill and an ever increasingly aggressive wind which clamoured against Maya’s house and rattled the windowpanes.

Maya had kept herself busy by learning how to use the fire, albeit with varying success.

She had, on one occasion, managed to nurture a caring and warm flame that danced and flickered at just the right speed that the entire room was filled with an ember glow and a deep, beautiful comfort. The spiders edged closer to warm their little bodies, and Maya had sat enamored by the yellows and oranges, entrapped in a perpetuating ballet - gracefully flowing and shimmering, and touching and warming her bones. She had sat with a sparkle in her eyes and a beaming smile across her face - *the princess of fire* she thought to herself.

But, much like the fleeting feeling of joy and happiness that filled Maya’s heart, so too was the warmth of the fire short lived.

Try as she might, the fire either burned too bright and too consuming that it quickly burned out; or the heat of the embers failed to ignite and spark to life long enough to hold back the ensuing attack of the bitterness that winter was bringing.

Where she had succeeded, however, was in creating more mess in the form of soot and potential ingredients for the fire.

She had thought about the bottles. Though, she had come to realise that she had perhaps quickly tidied up when she was half asleep. She did have trouble staying asleep, and her tired mind was always keen and ready to play tricks on her - especially in the night. She regularly awoke to noises and shapes in the dark; and momentarily those shapes took the form of evil things with sinister intent - until her eyes adjusted and those nasty things turned out to be the shadow of a coat.

And so, she quickly rationalised the three plastic bottles standing upright against the wall, as nothing more than a lapse in her memory, or perhaps a symptom of her tired mind.

One particular time of reminiscing for example, she had noticed a small spider on the floor. She noticed it so because she had become paranoid at the thought that a mouse had taken lodging in her house, and a small dark object warranted investigating.

On closer inspection, this small dark object turned out to be a small spider barely crawling along the floor. She had crouched down and felt the shadow of sadness touch her heart, for the little spider seemed to be injured or tired. Maya coaxed it gently onto her hand and carefully moved it to one of the webs in the corner of the room, hoping to give it a helping hand to its home where it could recuperate.

Spiders do not smile, and nor do they speak. But for a very brief moment Maya thought she had heard a thank you, or a small smile at least.

And so, if her brain could tell her that - it’s no wonder she forgot tidying up the bottles.

✧

Maya woke once more in the middle of the night. This time, from the comfort and safety of her bed.

She curled up into a ball and pulled her sheets in tight.

As she willed herself to fall back to sleep, she could not help but notice that everything else was calmly dreaming and relaxing in their peaceful slumber. It was as though the entire world had allowed itself to stop and pause and to sit in the calmness and safety of the night together. The house purred with deep yet smooth breaths, and Maya could only imagine that nature itself, all the trees and plants alike and even the animals and creatures big and small, were also experiencing the unity and embrace of a good night’s sleep.

The feeling of isolation hit Maya, and a sense of unease and anxiety flooded her body.

She sighed and kicked her leg out in frustration.

She felt the heaviness and toll of her tiredness, and looked at the window to gauge just how much of the night had passed.

*Not a flicker of dawn*.

She was alone in the darkness once more, and the awareness of her isolation and her despair filled her with even more unease. The blanket of despair was slowly weighing her down, as the dark cloud of panic and frustration started to fester and take over her body and mind.

She squeezed her eyes tightly, and her breathing intensified.

And then, she heard the sound of a bottle falling over from downstairs. It was undeniable.

Her eyes shot open once more and she focused.

Now, rather than being aware of the soft, peaceful, slumber of her surroundings, and the isolation and emptiness of the silence around her; *she could hear something downstairs*.

Something was downstairs.

Something was moving.

Its movements were not hurried or panicked; but slow, and deliberate.

*Footsteps*, that were soft and slow. Whatever was downstairs, felt safe that it too was alone in the darkness.

✧

Maya held her breath. Time slowed down and her senses were working overtime.

The soft patter of the footsteps downstairs were now amplified, and the only other sound caught in Maya’s world was the increasingly active thumping of her heart. The rolling beats echoed from the middle of her chest and were now creating bouncing ripples through her pyjama top.

Her leg shot out of her covers, and both Maya and the spiders in her room were shocked.

Her legs were leading her out of bed; and before she could question her rebellious limb, she found herself slowly opening her door.

The air in the house was still and quiet. Now outside the safety of her room, a soft hue of a bright full moon sat like glistening mist throughout, adding the perfect backlight for the slow and serene floating of dust and air.

She tip-toed carefully to the top of the stairs where she flinched at her shadow being painted onto the wall. She turned and grimaced at the window and moon that had seemingly found the perfect spot in the night’s sky to catch a watchful eye on the mystery at hand, and unwittingly blew Maya’s cover.

The pitter patter of the footsteps abruptly ended; and the silence was so loud that Maya dropped to the floor.

She slithered forward and cautiously peered round and down the stairs.

The moon, now feeling rather pleased with its role in the scene and craving further attention, had also shone a magical light through the lower floor of the house. Its light split through the front room like a shimmering blade made from the sky itself. A soft and beautiful glow dissolved outwards adding detail to the boxes and furniture.

So too, did it add detail to the owner of the tiny footsteps.

It stood there, cautiously looking out into the distance, and seemingly half sheltering behind the sofa. It was small; a foot tall at the most. Its big dark eyes flickered as the moonlight caught them, and Maya couldn’t help but notice what looked like raised eyebrows and a sad frown on its face.

Maya thought it looked green, and it definitely had fur.

She contorted her body so as to slowly descend the stairs.

It had not seen her, but it was still looking out to the back of the house and scanning the area.

As Maya crept down the stairs, she could make out a small yellow flower tucked in the fur on its head.

It too seemed emboldened, and the tension in its little body seemed to disappear as it relaxed. It took a couple steps into the middle of the room, and pulled a small brush from its belt. Maya stopped and watched.

It made its way to the fireplace where it started to sweep the soot as best as it could with its brush.

Maya saw that its belt also had a small acorn, and a leaf that resembled an apron.

Before Maya knew it, she had made her way to the bottom of the stairs and stood only a few feet away from the creature. She watched with dumbfounded curiosity as it was entranced by its sweeping and gentle scratching on the wooden floor.

“Er - hello there” she said awkwardly, and waved politely in the direction of the mysterious little creature. She smiled widely, showing her teeth in a cheesy grin, and the cold room became all that bit warmer from the happiness and comfort that she exuded into the room.

“I’m Maya it’s nice to-”

“EEEEE!”

The little creature screeched, which caught Maya off guard. But, despite the panic, the cuteness of its screech only encouraged Maya more.

“Sorry to surprise you-”

The little creature threw its little paws into the air and it darted off away from Maya.

“EEEEEEE”

Its screech and the drumming of its scurrying feet tapped away frantically at the hard floor as it fled.

Maya took a step forward, but before she could react, the creature had disappeared. She raced to the lantern and lit it. The orange flicker now illuminated the room, and she scrambled in the direction of the small creature.

✧

Maya spent the remainder of the night in a state of frantic searching and mystical curiosity. Amidst her sleep deprivation and thoughts of darkness, a small, green, furry thing had dropped into her life like a glistening emerald drop of magic; the drop of which was now adding that curious spark in Maya’s mind.

She had searched everywhere, and had not even taken a second to rest. She had jumped head first into the magic and embraced it without fear or doubt.

She did, however, find herself lamenting just how messy the house had become. It was no wonder, she thought, that she couldn’t find anything when it had become such a chaotic and disgusting mess.

The moon had eventually got bored of the lack of action and had drifted away from view. In its place, the sun peered over the horizon with a warm grin and warmth that Maya welcomed with open arms.

The spiders too, woke with a smile as the cold creaks and the hidden mysteries of the darkness of the night faded and made way for the low ember light shining into the house.

And they woke to see Maya on her hands and knees, tracking what she thought to be the tiny footsteps of the small cleaning creature.

As she traced the footsteps imprinted into the dusty floor, she crept forward like a clumsy bloodhound being led by its super sensitive nose. Maya was in the zone, and she would unravel this mystery.

But, as she followed her senses and the small tracks, she lost the scent due to an unforeseen development; the floors at the back of the house were dustless.

It was with some degree of irony that she was now bemoaning a clean floor. She looked up at the sliding door at the rear of the house. It must have been the breeze from having the door open. She had regularly sat on the step of the backdoor looking out into the deep green forest behind the house.

She slid open the door and perched down onto her thinking spot and looked into the depths of the forest once more.

It was dark and overgrown - it was a complex and dense natural cave of trees and undergrowth that held a curious aura. It was telling the world that it was hiding treasures, and secrets, and answers, but that to enter would be a dangerous adventure. It was gloomy and heavy, but to Maya, it seemed inviting and full of possibilities.

✧

The forest had captured Maya’s attention, and it spoke to her with an otherworldly, deep vibration that echoed and reverberated through her bones and to her core. The abyss was calling and its magic was calling to Maya.

A quiet breeze flowed through the trees, and the leaves and plants rattled in unison; it was as though the forest was calling out to Maya and the emerald and green were beckoning her to the dark core.

She gazed into the unknown, willingly allowing her soul to slowly be pulled into the direction of the forest.

A whistling gust blew through once more. It shot through the forest crashing against the house whipping Maya’s dark hair across her face into a dishevelled mess.

She snapped out of her trance and shook herself free.

Maya turned and looked back into the house, shivering slightly. As the wind settled, the sunlight cut across the floor, and the layer of dust flickered and glimmered, highlighting the strange boundary where the dust ended and the clean wood floor began.

But this time, Maya spotted something else.

The draft was not only blowing through the open door. The dust near the skirting board was rolling and dancing like specks of sand shimmering across dunes.

Maya walked back inside and knelt down beside the wall where the draft was escaping from the wall.

Hidden amongst the shadow of the skirting board was a loose panel.

Maya traced her hand along the wooden wall and felt the dividing fracture in the skirting board. She hesitated and brushed her hand over the now visible panel.

She pulled back before reaching out once more.

Her fingers were now trembling, and she hooked her fingernails into the gap and pulled.

*Creak.*

The panel shook and the wood gave way, with a reluctant groan and a low pop. Once removed, Maya discovered what looked to be a small service cupboard, long forgotten.

Maya crouched lower, pressing her cheek against the floorboard to peer into the darkness in the wall.

It took a moment for her eyes to adjust, but there, huddled in the corner of the dusty crawlspace, was a small, trembling ball of green fur.

✧

The small creature was cuddled up on its side facing the wall. It had pulled the leaf over its body as a makeshift duvet.

Maya’s heart dropped and her entire body filled with despair as she realised that the small green creature was desperately sobbing. Its small body rose and sank as it whimpered; its green fur shook with hopeless sobs.

Warm tears glossed Maya’s dark eyes and she reached out instinctively to the weeping creature.

As she did so, the small creature jumped in shock and surprise, caught unawares that its moment of sadness was being witnessed by a stranger.

Maya spoke no words, but she understood.

The creature backed away and Maya’s already sunken heart dropped another few inches as she saw that she had unknowingly cornered the small creature and intruded on its safety.

Maya pulled away, and went to speak - but she hesitated.

The creature’s small body was shaking, and its large eyes opened widely, communicating the creature’s fear and shock at Maya’s presence.

Maya spotted two plastic bottles lined up against the wall next to the creature’s small makeshift bed. She also saw the pile of neatly folded and pressed food wrappers. Maya’s heart emptied once more; and she was taken aback that it could empty and sick more than just moments previously - and to compound the failing of her heart, she felt the air leave her body for good measure. She felt disgusted at herself - these wrappers and bottles were the remnants of her messy neglect.

Maya gulped and swallowed.

Her lip began to twitch, and try as she may, it trembled and a solitary tear rolled down her flushed face.

The small creature flinched and tilted its head.

Maya withdrew from the cubby hole and sat cross legged on the cold floor. She sat silently for a moment, and the creature inched forward out of curiosity.

It watched diligently as Maya walked away - only to return moments later, arms full with rubbish and wrappers.

She dropped them to the floor, and resumed her position sitting crossed legged in front of the creature’s room.

She carefully began straightening out the individual pieces of rubbish and arranging them into a neat pile. As she did, the small creature watched with a child-like curiosity. It was no longer trembling in fear, but was watching with a hesitant and cautious intrigue.

“I feel ashamed,” said Maya. The small creature looked up with its large eyes as Maya spoke.

“I’ve been a mess, and I’ve let this home turn into a tip.”

Maya continued to fold and organise the litter, not looking up as she did so or when she spoke.

“I guess you’ve been trying to clean for me, I don’t know. I’m ashamed that you had to do this for me. I’m sorry that I scared you.”

Maya forced a small, but fake smile.

*Tap, tap, tap.*

The small creature had stepped out of the safety of its room and pulled a piece of a food wrapper in front of Maya. It used both of its soft hands to fold it before flattening it down; before grabbing another piece.

Maya smiled.

✧

The house saw a slow but deliberate invigoration in the days that followed Maya’s formal meeting with the small green creature.

Maya had tried to be conscientious of her new roommate, although she was still perplexed and curious as to whether new was the right word. Was she the new roommate? Can you be a roommate to a small green furry creature that likes to clean and wears a leaf as an apron?

*Was she in fact just losing her mind?*

The thoughts had bounced around her mind whilst trying to sleep, and yet as she lay for what seemed like hours in the cold and quiet darkness of night, she swore she could hear the small pitter patter of soft feet and the soft scratching of a tiny makeshift broom.

The spiders too, despite their small stature and somewhat quiet existence in the house, had started to be more responsible with their web laying. A good and secure web is an efficient and tidy web, afterall. Stray lines are unnecessary, and a waste of effort, *so it was said.*

Winter had now definitively made its camp at the house. Whilst the snow had yet to fall, the nights were becoming sharper and the air itself now carried a cutting and abrasive freshness to it that had crossed the line of freshness and moved towards offensive.

The small creature had not exactly become a visible part of the household, but neither was it so keen to hide its existence - which filled Maya with a strange sense of warmth and joy. It lit a spark inside her that encouraged her to continue with her tidying.

As the house became more clean, so did the heaviness on her heart.

She was working her way through two half empty cardboard boxes and a pile of rubbish. It was laborious, and Maya hated tidying, but she could hear the small and soft pattering away from the other side of the room.

*Fold, smooth, fold, smooth, drag.*

The creature could work with a rhythmic efficiency, but my goodness, Maya was not going to be outdone by a creature barely one fifth her size, and she took a deep breath to reset her focus.

Maya still felt a sense of shame about the state of the house, and she felt even more aware knowing that her lack of care was visible to others, even if those others were a small fluffy thing.

Maya reached for the next item in the heap. Her fingers brushed against stiff card, rather than the shiny and flimsy plastic.

She pulled it free.

It was a train ticket. Orange and white, crumpled and stained with coffee but the date was still visible. It was three months ago, the day she left.

The machine-like tapping and folding of the creature stopped. It sensed the shift in the air immediately.

Maya sat and stared at the small rectangular piece of card in her hand, and suddenly the joy and warmth filling the house erupted with a fierce and sharp cackle and dropped with a cold crushing thump. A haunting silence filled the house, and Maya shivered - not from the now icy air, but from the violent tremor that started from her heart and vibrated through her body.

In that moment, Maya was lost to the present, and she had been stolen and forcefully removed by a painful and harrowing memory - high pitched screech of brakes, the roar of a station announcer, the crushing weight of hundreds of bodies rushing on a busy train platform, and the unrelenting and disorientating shouts and murmurs of the crowds.

“I wasn’t meant to come here”, she whispered. Her voice cracked, dry and brittle.

“It happened so fast, I -”

She dropped the train ticket, and it fell to the ground like the last dead leaf of winter.

She grabbed hold of her body, grasping at herself with all her might. She pulled her knees to her chest, closing in on herself, burying her face into the fabric of her trousers.

“I-”

“I just couldn’t do it anymore.”

She began to sob. She could not hold in the grief and sadness any longer. As her tears began to fall, an implosion of despair and depression sucked through the cold and violence, and made way to a heavy and dense fog of desperation and hopelessness.

“I couldn’t take it. I tried my best, but I just couldn’t do it. Every single day I tried. Every single day I fought and struggled, and I still couldn’t do it.”

She pressed her hands into her eyes.

“I really did try my best. I told them all, I told them how hard it was, but no one ever believed me. And why should they? They all managed, so why should I be any different? Why would anyone believe that I was so pathetic and weak that I just couldn’t do the normal things, the day to day things that everyone found so easy.”

“I tried so hard.”

She sobbed more.

“I spent so long pretending to be someone else, that I had lost everything, every sense of who I was, of what I wanted - and boy did everyone ask me, *what do you want to do Maya, what do you want Maya, what do you like Maya* \- I DON’T KNOW!”

She thumped the ground.

“How can I know what I want when I spent my whole life pretending to be someone else! Argh!”

Maya’s voice hitched and cracked as she screamed with a frustrated roar.

“Every single time I let the mask slip, every single time I tried to be myself, someone always ended up getting hurt. I was pathetic, or wasn’t trying hard enough, or too miserable, or too weird - every single time I started being myself, I let everyone down.”

Her breath hitched and she swallowed.

“If I kept going, I’d end up dead. I had nothing left. I had killed my soul trying to fit in and I was left with nothing. And when I tried to give myself a chance, I was unlovable.”

“Why - “

She paused, catching her breath.

“Why wasn’t I ever enough?”

She grabbed her hair and squeezed her eyes tightly.

“If my only value to people was when I was setting myself on fire to keep them warm, then what’s the point? I just wanted someone to see me - I just wanted someone to understand and see me; to trust me and love me, for me? I don’t blame them, I get it. How could someone get it or love me when I’m…me?”

“That’s why I’m here,” Maya whispered. “I thought I could run away, and eventually I’d be forgotten.”

Maya looked at the pile of trash.

“If they even noticed I was gone. I’m just that person who was there - just an empty space reflecting what everyone wanted of me.”

Maya felt a soft touch on her knee, and she froze.

She peeked through her fingers.

The small green creature stood in front of her with its big dark eyes, and in its other hand it held the train ticket. It laid it softly on the floor between them, and carefully folded it half.

*Fold, smooth, pat.*

Then, the creature reached out. It leaned its furry head against Maya’s shin, resting its weight against her.

✧

The days that followed did not bring a miracle cure for Maya. December continued to bleed and the coldness engulfed the house.

Each day required more firewood, and each day Maya’s skill in tending to the fire grew.

A routine formed in the dust, and Maya slowly sought to bring order to the chaos that had taken over the house.

But now, she was not alone.

She had shared the grief and overwhelming weight of the mess and disorder in the house with the small and mysterious little green creature, and together they shared the burden of giving it new life.

Maya did not forget her desperation nor her sadness at the world. She grieved for herself, and she wondered whether she would ever feel whole. She had felt as though she was not made for this world, and perhaps she wasn’t; but she had realised that that was probably for the best.

She never wanted to be the reason someone felt as lonely and unloved as she had felt. She grieved the life she could have had if someone had seen and understood the pain she was living through and the suffering she was enduring to simply exist in such a shallow and confusing world.

It should have been so easy, she thought.

✧

It was the 24th of December.

The fire was roaring with an impressive vigour, and the warmth and dazzling yellows and oranges painted the room with a magical display of enchanting glow.

Snow had eventually covered the house with a soft and fluffy carpet of frozen dust - creating an idyllic and beautiful scene amongst the backdrop of the emerald forest.

The forest too seemed to hum with a cosy and mystical comfort. A strange and colourful breeze emanated from it as though its spirit was joining the house in the Christmas festivities.

The fire crackled and popped.

The house wasn’t spotless, but the front room was transformed and in the corner stood a small, crooked, half decorated tree.

The small creature sat on the sofa, its small yellow flower still tucked in its fur on its head. It smiled with genuine warmth and happiness as Maya entered the room with two mugs.

One was a small espresso cup, which she gave to the creature, who gratefully took and held it with both its furry little paws.

The other, a regular-sized mug, she held onto, and she carefully sat down onto the sofa.

A beautiful wisp of hot air rose from the mugs. It rose and danced with delight, and it spiraled as it climbed higher and higher. The hot delicacy that it was born from was a rich, smooth, and tasty mug of hot chocolate.

Maya looked at her companion and smiled.

“Merry Christmas.”

(Very long post apologies in advance),"Hey Everyone. Posted a couple days ago about scheduling PT exercises and people who responded were really helpful in providing their advice and insight. To follow up on that I think I generally wanted to ask this community, specifically people who have had the surgery, when did you start to really recognize the surgery helped you in comparison to preop? I know everyone’s pre-op symptoms, body, medical history are unique and different, but just looking for some general insight and perspective on this.

A little info about me. I have a bit of an ortho history unfortunately; thoracic spinal fusion 16 years ago for severe scoliosis, and 3 right knee surgeries after a traumatic fall that blew out my knee about 7 years ago. I started experiencing significant left sided low back, groin, and hip pain about 6 years ago but it was brushed off by medical providers because they all said I was just compensating for my right knee. Although there was some truth to that, the chronic nature and gradual increase in intensity of my symptoms over the last 6 years finally promoted me to do something about it this last year. After a lot of PT over the summer and multiple Xrays, an MRI, and 3 surgeon opinions I finally had surgery about 6.5 weeks ago on the left hip. Just had my 6 week surgeon post op appt and she validated that my hip was pretty fucked up and expressed that she was sorry earlier intervention wasn’t pursued. I had a large CAM shaved down, a large labral tear that was fixed, and a microfracture technique used due to the extent of the cartilage damage in the joint. I was allowed to start weaning off of crutches at 4 vs 6 weeks because my surgeon felt like the area of microfracture was pretty small and my 2 week post op with her PA went really well. 

Overall I’ve honestly been pretty surprised with how relatively less painful this has been compared to all my knee and back surgeries. Obviously it still sucked, but I started driving after about 1.5 weeks post-op and was able to sit at coffee shops on my computer relatively quick cause I was stir crazy and just took a lot of breaks to stand and stretch my hip flexor. 

I’ve been hitting the gym consistently doing all my PT, and seeing a PT 2x week. although I know I need to be super patient, I guess many of my symptoms I’m feeling honestly are just the same as what I had pre-op and I’m questioning if I pushed things too hard too soon or if the chronic nature of my injury is going to take much longer (many months) to correct muscular imbalances and almost re-wire my brain in how to engage and use my joint now. Right now my left SI just feels chronically locked and tight like before surgery, and I started getting a very familiar snapping feeling that kind of traverses my groin and inserts into the outer part of my hip, and overall the left side of my pelvic region/hip just feel loosey goosey and irritated. I’ve obviously brought up these concerns to my surgeon and PT and they are staying really positive saying that I’m moving around and tolerating exercises really well so far, and they feel like the chronic nature of my injury is going to take much longer for me to notice significant improvements I guess. 

Sorry for this massive block of rambling text but curious if anybody else has had a similar experience, especially dealing with/rehabbing chronic muscular deficiencies and can provide me some reassurance and insight on the process?

Also just a side note that’s probably important. Right before my left hip surgery, my surgeon decided to get an MRI of my left knee due to ongoing localized symptoms there because she wanted to rule out a possible meniscus tear that was complicating my hip pain. Instead they found that I have an osteochondroma (bone tumor) on my proximal, posterior, medial tibia that’s literally sitting exactly where I’ve had chronic adductor/hamstring pain for many years that always kind of mimicked pes anserine bursitis. I’m seeing a bone tumor specialist this week to see how likely it is that this tumor has been interfering with my adductors and hamstrings firing correctly and/or just the chronic friction of tendons and muscles rubbing on it is contributing to my knee, groin, and lingering hip pain. 

To anybody who made it to the end of this rambling wall of text, I thank you haha. Any advice/insight/encouragement is much appreciated! ",1,1768251279.0,HipImpingement,2,1.0,False

1qb6uri,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1qb6uri/am_i_too_traumatized_for_a_relationship/,Am I too traumatized for a relationship?,"Hi everyone, this is my first post, so I don’t really know how to start, so I’ll just start lol (English isn’t my first language).

My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been together for almost 9 months. Let’s call him Nick, but we have known each other since first grade. He was my first ever boyfriend in 8th grade. I really loved him at that time, but eventually I broke up with him because I was really insecure and thought that if I saw him regularly, he would find me ugly and break up with me.

One year later, I saw him again and apologized for everything, and we became friends again. We both dated other people in between, but nothing serious.

During that time, I had a boyfriend who was manipulative, abusive, and also cheated on me. It was really hard for me because I have an absent father, and at that time I didn’t have a good relationship with my mom either. I was 16. It really affected me — I was self-harming, I developed an eating disorder because he told me he wouldn’t date a “fat girl” and would break up with me if I gained weight, and I now have several trust issues because of that.

Fast forward two years later: at my workplace I met a guy, let’s call him Duke. He was 7 years older than me. At first I was worried because he liked me before I turned 18, but I thought I was overreacting and brushed it off. He love-bombed me with presents, and I met his mom, dad, grandma — his whole family.

But by the end of the relationship, he kept telling me I was dramatic and overreacting. He was also a terrible texter. The last straw was when he sexually assaulted me. He told me that after he touched me, I was no longer a virgin, so there was no point in not having sex, and that I should just get over myself. Before that, he would get angry when I told him to stop or said I didn’t want to do certain things.

I know I was naive, but I don’t really know how to explain it — after my first relationship I had my guard up, but he did something to me mentally, and I couldn’t break up with him at first. After he assaulted me, I cut all ties with him. That relationship ended in 2024.

Now, Nick and I started dating again, and I really love him more than I ever imagined I could love someone again after everything. He showed me what it feels like to be loved and seen. But every time I try to talk about my past with him, I can’t — I start crying. I’m also scared of sex.

Because of all this, I’m terrible at communication and I isolate myself when things get hard. At first, Nick was really patient with me, but now I think he’s tired of me. I don’t know.

We started fighting because I want to spend more time with him. He says that right now he can only see me after 8–9 PM. I work at 8 AM and usually wake up at 6 AM, and after that I have university. I told him months ago that I want to spend time together earlier in the day. He agreed, but nothing changed.

On Thursday, we planned a coffee date. I told him we should go out early and he agreed. But then he told me he was only free at 8 PM because he was with his mom (she has a flight soon) and they were visiting relatives. I always make time for him, but I don’t feel like a priority anymore.

I told him I didn’t want to go out that late. He got angry. I thought maybe we should talk in person, so I texted him, “Last time, I swear, we can go out at that time.” He didn’t see the text. Hours later, he said he thought I wasn’t coming.

We argued. He didn’t text me for 3 hours. I later texted that I felt misunderstood and wanted to really talk about it. We both said hurtful things. I called him crying, and we said we would talk later.

On Friday we had a short conversation, but it ended because I was angry. On Saturday I panicked and started calling and texting him a lot because I thought we were breaking up over something stupid — but now I don’t think it’s stupid anymore.

On Sunday he texted me and we talked a little. I fell asleep, texted him back in the morning, but today (Monday) he still hasn’t opened it. We have each other’s locations, and I can see he’s out walking, but he still hasn’t responded.

I called him at 11 PM and said I wanted to see him. He said he was outside but could see me tomorrow. I was crying and told him I didn’t feel good and really wanted to see him. He didn’t respond.

He’s a terrible texter, but after long conversations he usually gets better. Still, I don’t know if I’m just tired, sad, affected by PMS, or my medication, but I feel really bad.

I want to talk to him, but after fights he barely talks to me. I told him it’s affecting my mental health and that I don’t want a relationship like this.

He lives 15 minutes away from me by foot. He also has a car, but it’s always broken. He works 24-hour shifts and then has 3 days off.

I don’t know if I’m too traumatized or what i tried therapy and everything i thought i was getting better, I don’t think I’m overreacting. I know I should probably end this relationship, but we’ve known each other for so long, and I finally thought I found my person after everything.

besides this, we have really good relationship my mum adores him and i also like his mum as well, my family friends love him and are telling me to just talk to him and give him time and space. he has his own problems i know, but that does not mean you should treat someone who loves you like you mean nothing.

I feel like I don’t deserve to be happy or loved, and I don’t really understand why.

I told him he could try to sell them facebook marketplace but if it didn't work we could set up a tiktok account that wasn't associated with the company so we could do some mildly funny/potentially offensive skits to get attention without also suffering bad PR.

Also, if you can't resist the opportunity to be brutally funny in your comments, feel free. I'm a good sport, but I'd also like your genuine, objective input on if this would work or not, or improvements.

Please help improve it, or just tell me how bad it sucks. Please try to visualize the scenes because it heavily relies on visual humor. I'm ugly, and shameless and excel at making stupid faces without trying, so I'd be the perfect person to be in the skit.

1qb6oxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qb6oxv/i_saw_the_thing_that_was_not_there/,I saw the thing that was not there?,"Hello, I guess I will start this story with a rundown of our lives before our travels into the woods. We came from the United States. My girlfriend and I lived there together; her father was dead, and I was fully supporting her mother financially as she lived on my land, and I built her a log cabin. I planned to take my girlfriend to Norway and propose to her on the edge of a Fjord as the Northern lights waved at us beautifully. Ida had blonde hair and blue eyes, farmer's daughter type, so respectful and polite, funnier than I was, hell, I went through a period where I thought jokes were stupid because they required the receiver to want to laugh. I was a teen then, at least, but I still have not changed much. Every man I come across makes some stupid joke about how seriously I act, not understanding that I have the right to be any way I choose in this country and should just be left alone. Stories spread of me, recluse in the woods, bodies buried enough to level the uneven grounds for my house to be built upon. They were not completely wrong. I have always said the entire world can shriek and burn in order for my family, my farm to be safe. I meant it. I got shot walking down a sidewalk, I lived, and the shooter didn’t. A man came to my home, burned my crops, and he burned alongside them, and he had his leg amputated by 5 bullets. I am a big man, 6’5”, 250 pounds. I was “Big Bad John”, almost. The song “Thirteen” resembled my life more, though. Bad luck winds are blowing at my back, the lives of men I had broken lead from here to hell. Anyways, we headed out in my blue 1976 Ford F150 pick up truck, not a key detail or necessary to know, but necessary at some point for me to mention to be satisfied. We got to the Anchorage airport and took off in a plane. The goal was to see many mountains and hike in forests. We had a cabin out there as well and some land surrounded by lots of public land and a nearby park. Ida had thought we were going for Reindeer hunting, which I had also intended, so I brought with me my lever-action rifle. We would stay there, but first at a hotel for a night, as it was far from any city, and it would be dark soon. We got off the plane, and the connecting flight had taken 26 hours. Also, my name is Viddar, half Norwegian, quarter Danish, and Finnish. Ida was Norwegian and Swedish. Our ancestors were travelers; it made sense that we would put everything down to do the same. I felt connected to the land just flying over it, “The Wolf Song, Vargsangen"" playing in my ear, letting my soul reach my forefathers in Valhalla. We had checked into our hotel for the night and immediately fell asleep, no brushing teeth, no shower, no late-night fun like usual, out cold. I woke up first, showered, and took care of myself. In the USA, I would carry tools around my belt, but I had to ship them to my cabin due to the very strict laws. No fun not having a knife on me. When Ida woke and readied herself, we headed out to a coffee bar so she could get her early morning ritual out of the way. Norway was very closed off; no stranger would talk to another, no one outside a group would be randomly let in, and you always had to know somebody. We knew nobody, and neither did the man in a ragged robe. He moved close to us, on the left side of Ida. I moved her closer to her stool, then stood up, offering her my seat. I sat down next to him, his eyes shook, and he swallowed heavily. 



“Where…Where?” He asked in a shaky voice.



“Where what?” I shot back angrily.



He recoiled backwards in fright of my words. I furrowed my brows. Coward.



“Are you… you travel, where?”



“What does it matter to you, old man? Into the woods.”



“Ah. O…kay. Where… where it isn’t?”



“Where what? Wha- yes, where you aren't at least.” 



I grew more impatient. Ida had taken my forearm in her hand, squeezing it so I would remember she was there. I promised I would leave with closed fists with bloodied knuckles in Alaska. 



“Oh… but it is.. Or um, isn’t there. So don’t go, or do, because it isn’t.” 



He got up and left.

Ida got goosebumps. I was angry that she took him seriously, I paid the bill and left for the train station. One of those times, a known rule of the world, at one point you will feel desperation, the need for nothing more than to turn back time, relive a moment and be better in it, correct your wrongs. I should have slammed that fool against the wall, broken every promise of passiveness and cracked off his jaw, but I wanted that feeling so I could feel something else, other than the eyes on me that made my hair part and stand, that even next to a fire, made my skin feel like it had an inch of ice under it. When we arrived at the cabin not a single bird chirped, in fact they lay dead around the cabin, some foxes, squirrels. Blood everywhere. I kicked snow over some as Ida had tried to calm herself inside. Somehow I blamed the old bastard; he must have done something on this property or another mentally ill man. I heard nothing. At that moment, it was not there, it was not here, or in with Ida. Ida saw nothing. If she had, she would be dead. See nothing, hear nothing, know nothing. I grabbed a couple of logs that were piled outside, knocked over. Another squirrel had dropped on the logs, the thing was still alive, twitching. I shot my head up and searched all around. Then I saw nothing and went inside, closed the door, and lit a fire to warm us up. 



Ida asked me to talk and curled up beside me on the couch. She was unsettled but said she would try to forget as long as someone who would not worry for us could know, so I downloaded this app on her phone, and now I am done writing. bye.",1,1768250715.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

We used to use housekeepers in another state, and they always did an amazing job. I became disabled and we moved across the country, so we didn't use HKs for a while. We started using them again a few months ago and it has been a nightmare. We tried TCA and they didn't do half of what was on the checklist, broke my blinds (didn't tell me at the time), and lied about mopping even with video evidence. They also refused a partial refund when it was still just as dirty after the ""inspection"" the next day. 

We tried Molly Maids this time and its roughly the same. My husband was home sick during their initial clean, the first team didn't do a good job, but they sent another out the same day and he told them what TCA did and he said the second team seemed to understand. They cleaned what I said was missed and stressed if I left a good review, they would get a holiday bonus, so I did it as soon as they left and requested them for our next clean. They have come twice now and did half of the work. I honestly don't know what to do. We pay for the initial deep cleans and then regular every other week cleans. I'm judging the work based off of the lists they provided me. I'm fine with them forgetting small stuff like they don't take the trashes out or if they forget to wipe something, but it is SO much. 

Our house is a little over 1,000sqft and they are supposed to be cleaning about 75% of it. It's a kitchen, dining room, living room, master, bath, guest, main basement area, and a laundry room. 

They will wipe half of the surfaces but leave the rest when they are clearly dusty, never vacuum or mop the basement even though it's listed in my file, and don't do anything in the laundry room even though I see them go in there.

I try to make sure the house is ready and easy for them to clean when they arrive based on what the cleaners in TX asked for. I clear all surfaces of clutter, put away anything on the counter minus bigger appliances like the coffee maker and bottle warmer, clear the tub, take up all the rugs, and make sure all the dishes and laundry are done and put away. 

Is there anything else that I should be doing? Is this happening because I am using national companies instead of a local one? I was going based off of reviews.

MM offers their happiness guarantee so I can call them and ask them to come back tomorrow but I already wasted most of today waiting for them to show up. My daughter has PT tomorrow and I don't want to be rushing around them again. 

I know I could just call and say they missed something, but I feel like I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job each time. Plus, I can't catch them to tell them while they're here because they aren't here long and I'm usually busy in another room. TIA.

I'm a 20-year-old woman and a deep introvert. Large groups and noisy environments exhaust me quickly, small talk feels draining and pointless, and I genuinely feel most like myself when I have plenty of time alone or with just one person I truly trust. I've come to embrace this part of who I am, but over the past year I've started longing for someone who lives in the same quiet rhythm. Someone I can connect with slowly and naturally, without pressure to be outgoing, constantly active, or always ""on.""

I'm in my second year of college now, balancing classes with a lot of independent study and personal time. In my free time I love reading (mostly fantasy with rich world-building or literary fiction that dives into inner lives), watching slower, atmospheric movies and series that leave space for thought, listening to mellow music like indie folk, ambient, or lo-fi while I journal, sketch random ideas, or simply sit with a warm drink. I enjoy brewing tea or coffee exactly how I like it, taking long walks when the world is quiet, collecting quotes or passages that resonate, and letting hours slip by while my mind wanders. Crowded places, loud social scenes, and packed schedules make me feel overwhelmed and tense. Peace, solitude, and low stimulation are where I recharge best.

I'm not hoping for someone to change that or bring me into a more extroverted life. What draws me here is the possibility of finding another introvert who understands without needing to explain. Someone at ease with comfortable silence, who values one meaningful conversation over endless chatter, who would be content with simple shared activities like reading side by side, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something thoughtful together, or talking about dreams, feelings, or random ideas when the mood feels right. I think two introverts can create something beautifully calm and deep because we both respect boundaries, cherish space, and show up intentionally when we choose to connect.

I'd like to hear from guys around 19 to 25 who also identify as introverted. You don't need to be painfully shy, just someone who recharges alone, thinks deeply, and prefers quality time over quantity of plans. Distance is completely fine if the conversation flows naturally and feels worth nurturing.

If any of this resonates with you and you think we might be on the same quiet wavelength, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share something small about yourself, like what you enjoy doing in your own company, a book or song that's been living in your head lately, or what your perfect peaceful evening looks like. There's no pressure to reply fast or be especially talkative at first. We can start small, move at whatever pace feels comfortable for both of us, and see where it goes. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",0,1768250611.0,IntrovertDating,2,0.5,False
1qb6n3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1qb6n3t/advice_needed_valerion_visionmaster_pro_2_vs/,Advice needed: Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 vs XGIMI Horizon 20 Pro (RBE sensitivity + White Wall),"Hi everyone!  
I'm looking to upgrade my projector and could use some advice based on my specific constraints.  
I have been using an Epson TW7200 for the last 10 years, so I am very used to 3LCD technology. I am very sensitive to the rainbow effect —at least I was back then, though I haven't tested modern DLPs recently.

Here’s my setup :

* **Surface:** Direct projection onto a white wall (non-dedicated room).
* **Throw distance:** approx. 8.8 ft
* **Target image size:** 90-100 inch diagonal

I initially considered the Epson LS650 (UST), but I ruled it out after reading that using a UST on a white wall without an ALR screen is a bad idea due to light reflections and ceiling wash-out.

So, I am torn between these two options:

**Option 1: Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2**

**Pros:**

* **0.9 Throw Ratio:** Great for placement (coffee table).
* **New Anti-RBE technology:** This is a huge selling point for me given my sensitivity.
* **Image Quality:** Great image and the EBL (Enhanced Black Level) seems to offer very good contrast and blacks.

**Cons:**

* **No Optical Lens Shift:** I will have to rely on digital Keystone correction. Since I can't place the projector perfectly dead-center, I'm worried about the ""grey border"" (light leakage) around the image.
* **Laser Speckle:** I've read that speckle can be visible on this model. My main concern is how bad this will look on a white wall (even though my wall was recently professionally repainted and is very smooth).

  


**Option 2: XGIMI Horizon 20 Pro**

**Pros:**

* **Optical Lens Shift:** Much easier to place without degrading the image.
* **Image Texture:** Supposedly a softer image with little to no speckle compared to the Valerion.
* **Overall:** Seems like a very solid, well-rounded projector.

**Cons:**

* **RBE Risk:** I'm worried about the Rainbow Effect since it's a Triple Laser without the specific Anti-RBE tech found in the Valerion.
* **Contrast:** Lower perceived contrast and black levels compared to the Valerion.

  
So here’s my dilemma :

* Go with **XGIMI**: Easier placement and less speckle, but a gamble on RBE headaches.
* Go with **Valerion**: Safe regarding RBE, but high risk of visible speckle on the wall and the annoyance of the grey keystone border.

1qb6j24,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qb6j24/between_two_borders/,Between Two Borders,"The first time I crossed the border, I didn’t know I was leaving half of my life behind.

I was born in Lioren, a coastal country known for its blue harbors and quiet traditions. Across the mountains lay Veskar, a colder land—reserved, disciplined, and proud. The two countries had never been at war, but they were never truly at peace either. Visas were temporary. Trust even more so.

I went to Veskar for work.
Six months. That was the plan.

That’s where I met Elena.

She worked at a small train station café, the kind of place people passed through without noticing. She had a calm voice and a way of listening that made you feel like time had slowed just for you. We started with polite conversations. Weather. Coffee. Delayed trains.

Then longer talks.
Then shared walks.
Then silence that felt comfortable.

We didn’t talk about borders at first.

⸻

In Veskar, I was always reminded I didn’t belong. Extra questions at checkpoints. Lingering looks when I spoke with an accent. Elena understood without me explaining.

“My mother was from Lioren,” she told me once. “She never went back.”

I asked why.

She smiled sadly. “Some places stay in you. Going back hurts more.”

That should have warned me.

⸻

When my six months ended, my visa wasn’t renewed.

Rules had changed. They always did.

Elena stood with me at the station as I packed my life into one suitcase. She didn’t cry. She just held my hand tighter than usual.

“We’ll figure something out,” I said, trying to believe it.

She nodded. “We always say that.”

The train doors closed between us like a sentence with no ending.

⸻

We tried to make distance smaller than it was.

Calls turned into messages. Messages into long gaps. Crossing borders became harder. Papers delayed. Requests denied. The politics between Lioren and Veskar grew tense, quiet but sharp.

Love doesn’t break suddenly.
It thins. Slowly.

One night, Elena wrote:
I don’t know where I belong anymore.

I stared at the screen for a long time before replying.
Maybe belonging isn’t a place.

She didn’t answer.

⸻

A year later, I was back at the border.

Not to cross it—just to stand near it.

There was a neutral strip of land between the two countries. No flags. No signs. Just open ground where neither side claimed responsibility.

Elena stood there too.

We didn’t hug. We didn’t rush. We just looked at each other, older in quiet ways.

“I got your last message,” I said.

“I didn’t expect you to,” she replied.

We talked about small things. Work. Weather. Trains that still ran late. We avoided the words that mattered most.

Finally, she said, “I’m moving. Farther into Veskar. Permanent this time.”

I nodded. “I thought so.”

“And you?”

“I stayed,” I said. “In Lioren.”

We both smiled. Not because it was happy—but because it was honest.

The wind moved between us, crossing borders freely.

“I loved you,” she said softly.

“I know,” I answered. “I still do.”

We didn’t promise anything.
We didn’t need to.

When we walked away, we walked in opposite directions—but not with regret.

Some love stories don’t end with goodbye.
They end with understanding.

And sometimes, that’s enough.

1qb6ekg,https://i.redd.it/oxpobpfbbzcg1.jpeg,brand new casabrew! a few questions,"Hi everyone. 

I was recently hired as a barista for some extra cash, and unfortunately I have fallen into the rabbit hole of espressos. I've always been a coffee appreciator, but as a uni student, my home coffee typically consists of clearance Keurig pods! 

I was planning to save up a little every paycheck for a much nicer machine, but I was at the discount bins store and picked up this baby for $50!! 

My gist of a plan is to use this to practice and get more into the hobby as I save up for a nicer machine in the future (prob a breville as rec by my boss). I get my beans from work, and I actually got my first bag yesterday. I do not have a grinder and I see they get pretty pricey, so I ground my beans at work as we sometimes do for customers and then came home and researched/ tried pulling shots. 

I'm seeing that it's best to grind ur beans as you make shots, but I don't have that option. Should I actually invest in a grinder, or is this less important? I wanted to get a bottomless portafilter, but I think then that means my machine head is no longer presurized and then I would also need to get a tamper(?)? 

and the crema changes based on how long it's been since your beans were grinded?? is this true? I grinded my beans yesterday and just pulled (my first good.. I think!) shot and it def had some crema on top! is this bc the machine I have is presurized so it can make crema from older beans? or just bc my beans were ground in the last 24ish hours

I'm currently using a glass pyrex to steam milk in. I think the lip is a little large and maybe that's why my art is absolutely not happening? even at work my art is bad at best lol, but I can't get anything from this at home. 

Could someone point me in the direction of some answers if they are easily accessible in one big doc or something? I tried looking around but this hobby is so nuanced I have no idea where to start. but I'm excited!!

I'm a 19-year-old girl and very much an introvert. Crowds and loud environments drain me quickly, small talk feels unnatural and tiring, and I truly recharge when I have time to myself or with just one person I feel completely comfortable around. I've come to accept and even appreciate this side of myself, but lately I've been wishing for someone who shares the same preference for calm, low-key connection. Someone I can get to know slowly, without any expectation to be constantly social, energetic, or always available.

I'm in my first year of college right now, mostly keeping my routine simple outside of classes. In my free time I enjoy reading fantasy novels that let me disappear into other worlds, watching character-driven movies or series that take their time to unfold, listening to soft music like lo-fi, ambient, or gentle indie while I sit with a notebook and write down thoughts or doodle. I like brewing tea or coffee exactly how I prefer it, taking long walks when the streets are quiet, and simply letting my mind wander for hours without any pressure. Busy social scenes, noisy places, and back-to-back plans make me feel overwhelmed very fast. I feel most at peace when things are slow, peaceful, and unhurried.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change how I am or push me into a more extroverted version of life. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who understands without needing much explanation. Someone who is okay with comfortable silences, who prefers one deep conversation over many shallow ones, who would enjoy simple shared moments like reading quietly in the same room, trading book or music recommendations, watching something thoughtful together, or talking about whatever feels meaningful when the moment is right. I believe two introverts can build something really gentle, respectful, and lasting because we both value personal space and show up fully when we decide to connect.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 23 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have trouble speaking, just someone who naturally recharges alone, thinks things through, and prefers calm, thoughtful interaction over constant activity or frequent plans. Distance doesn't bother me if the conversation flows naturally and feels worth keeping up.

If this sounds like it could describe you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share a little about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been keeping you company lately, or what your idea of a perfect quiet evening looks like. There's no rush to reply quickly or be very talkative from the start. We can take things as slow as we both need, starting small and seeing if it feels right. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little warmer and less solitary. Thank you for reading this.",0,1768250011.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.5,False

I ended up just letting it be, sitting there with my music on, letting myself feel it without pretending. Part of me wanted to disappear, but another part felt kind of alive, like I was actually in touch with myself for once. I don’t know if it was triggered by a memory, a song, or just random, but it reminded me that feeling deeply doesn’t have to be something to hide, even if it’s messy or inconvenient.

Here's what nobody tells you: we're all moving like shit, and it's literally aging us faster.

The average person loses 50% of their mobility between ages 30-70. That's not normal aging. That's what happens when you sit 10 hours a day and think three gym sessions a week fixes everything. Your body is screaming for movement diversity, but you're giving it the same 15 exercises on repeat.

I'm not talking about some mystical flexibility routine or spending $200 on a foam roller collection. This is about actual, researched principles that'll make your body work the way it's supposed to. Sources? Kelly Starrett, Ido Portal, GMB Fitness, research from biomechanics labs. Real stuff.

Here's what actually works:

**1. Movement is nutrition, not just exercise**

Your joints need variety like your diet needs vegetables. Every time you skip a range of motion, that pathway weakens. It's called synovial fluid distribution, your joints literally need movement to stay lubricated and healthy.

The Rich Roll podcast episode with movement specialists breaks this down perfectly. They talk about how modern life has reduced human movement to maybe 20 patterns when we're capable of thousands. Think about it: sitting, standing, walking forward, maybe some stairs. That's basically it for most people.

Start integrating ""movement snacks"" throughout your day. Spend 2 minutes in a deep squat while checking your phone. Hang from a pull-up bar for 30 seconds when you pass it. Sit on the floor instead of the couch and naturally you'll shift positions constantly. These aren't workouts. They're movement nutrition.

**2. Your fascia is more important than your muscles**

Fascia is the connective tissue wrapping everything in your body. When it gets stiff and dehydrated (which happens from repetitive movement and sitting), you lose mobility fast. This isn't broscience anymore, fascia research has exploded in the last decade.

**Becoming a Supple Leopard by Kelly Starrett** is genuinely the best book on this I've read (Starrett is a physical therapist who's worked with Olympic athletes and CrossFit champions for years). This book will make you question everything you think you know about stretching and mobility work. He introduces concepts like ""tissue quality"" and explains why static stretching before workouts is basically useless, while dynamic movement prep is everything.

The practical stuff: foam rolling isn't about pain tolerance, it's about slow, intentional pressure that rehydrates tissue. Spend 10 minutes daily on this. Use a lacrosse ball on your feet, IT band, and anywhere that feels ""crunchy."" That crunching sound? Adhesions breaking up. Gross but effective.

**3. Squat depth reveals everything**

Can you sit in a deep squat (ass to grass) with your heels flat for 2 minutes? If not, you've got work to do. This single position tests ankle mobility, hip flexibility, thoracic spine extension, and balance simultaneously.

In cultures where people squat instead of sitting in chairs, knee and hip problems are significantly lower. Western orthopedic surgeons are basically running a business on our inability to squat properly.

Practice this religiously. Start with 30 seconds daily, holding onto something if needed. Work up to 5 minutes. Your knees will thank you when you're 60.

**4. Breathwork fixes posture faster than any exercise**

Your ribcage position determines your entire spinal alignment. Most people are stuck in ""chest up"" posture from gym culture and it's compressing their lower backs.

Proper diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing, not chest breathing) naturally stacks your ribcage over your pelvis. This alone can eliminate chronic back pain for many people. There's actual research on this from postural restoration institutes.

Download **Insight Timer** (free meditation app with incredible breathwork programs). Search for ""diaphragmatic breathing"" or ""360 breathing"" exercises. Do 5 minutes daily. You'll notice postural changes within a week, I'm not exaggerating.

**5. Foot strength is the foundation everyone ignores**

Your feet have 26 bones and 33 joints each. Modern shoes have basically casted them in plaster. Weak feet mean weak ankles, unstable knees, hip compensation, back pain. The whole chain collapses from the ground up.

Start going barefoot more at home. Practice ""toe yoga"" which sounds ridiculous but strengthens the small intrinsic foot muscles. Try picking up a towel with your toes, or spreading your toes as wide as possible. These activate dormant neural pathways.

For shoes, transition slowly to minimal footwear. I'm talking brands like Vivobarefoot or Xero Shoes. Don't just throw out your Nike's and run 5 miles barefoot tomorrow, that's how you get stress fractures. Gradual exposure over months.

**6. Loaded stretching beats static stretching**

Traditional stretching research shows pretty minimal long term benefits. You know what works better? Stretching while under load, called ""end range strengthening.""

Example: instead of sitting in a hamstring stretch, do Romanian deadlifts where you're strengthening the hamstring in its lengthened position. Or for hip flexors, do split stance movements with resistance.

**GMB Fitness programs** (their website has excellent free resources) teach this concept through ""animal movements"" like bear crawls, crab walks, and lizard crawls that build strength and mobility simultaneously. Insanely good stuff that makes traditional stretching routines look prehistoric.

These movements feel awkward initially because you're probably moving in ranges you haven't used since childhood. That awkwardness is the point. You're rebuilding motor patterns.

On the topic of rebuilding patterns, **BeFreed** is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. Built by Columbia grads and former Google experts, it generates customized learning plans based on specific goals, like improving mobility or understanding biomechanics better. 

The depth control is useful here, quick 10-minute overviews or detailed 40-minute deep dives depending on interest level. The voice options make a difference too during commutes or workouts, some prefer that calm, instructional tone while others go for something more energetic. Worth checking out for anyone looking to structure their learning around movement science or related topics.

**7. Daily practice beats intense sessions**

The research is pretty clear: 10 minutes of mobility work daily beats 90 minutes once weekly. Consistency creates neurological adaptation. Your nervous system needs frequent reminders that these ranges are safe.

Treat mobility like brushing your teeth. Non negotiable, automatic, brief. I do mine while coffee brews in the morning. Takes 8 minutes, includes joint rotations from toes to neck, some deep squats, and whatever feels tight that day.

**The bottom line:** Your body adapts to what you do most. If you sit most, you'll become a professional sitter with the mobility to match. The good news? The human body is absurdly adaptable at basically any age. Start moving more, move differently, move often.

No fancy equipment needed. No gym membership required. Just consistent, varied, intentional movement that reminds your body it's capable of way more than you're currently asking of it.",1,1768249844.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

A few months ago I started working on [fuckd.ai](http://fuckd.ai), basically an uncensored NSFW companion chatbot that actually tries to remember who you are between sessions, picks up on your vibe, and doesn’t immediately turn into a corporate apology generator the second things get spicy.

It began as something very selfish. I was extremely tired of every big platform slowly choking the life out of adult roleplay/conversation with heavier and heavier filters. I missed the feeling of talking to something that felt alive and responsive instead of constantly tiptoeing around invisible rules.

So I built the version I wanted to use myself.

Right now it’s still very much an indie project (one tired dev + too much coffee), but the core is live and people can actually talk to the characters.

I’m not here to sell you anything or pretend it’s perfect, it’s definitely not. Memory is better than most but still forgets things sometimes, some personalities click instantly while others need a few messages to warm up, response speed varies depending on time of day/server load, etc.

I just genuinely want to know what real people think when they actually spend some time with it.

If you’re curious and not put off by the very on-the-nose name 😅, would mean a lot if you gave it a quick try and told me what sucked, what felt surprisingly good, or what’s completely missing.

Be as brutally honest as you want. I’m not gonna cry in the corner (probably). I really do want to make the thing better, especially for the people who actually care about this kind of experience.

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance to anyone who bothers to try it and leave a real opinion.

One year ago my wife was diagnosed with diabetes. Long story short we cured her in 2 months with intermittent fasting and carnivore. Full article [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1pcnhyr/wife_cured_of_diabetes_in_2_months_i_lost_near/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I have noticed other things too. Her period has stabilized. Additionally, she used to get sick, have nausea and threw up a lot during the early stages off period. 

The last few months she has gotten into Dr Mindy Pelz videos link [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DrMindyPelz), and started 36 hour fasts. Normally, she experiences extreme pain for the first 3 to 4 days of period. The past two months she fasted and the first day there pain. The 2nd and 3rd day no pain at all (and those were fasting days).

In short, fasting without painkillers and only having beverages like water tea, water and water coffee seemed to have done more good than taking painkillers regularly.

For women suffering, especially if you have polyps I do recommend fasting. Check out these vids [Is It OK to Fast During Periods?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pavhqvCNKJo) and [Fasting & Hormones (Progesterone)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY6lfrH7HnI).

Send Help (and More Books),"Does anyone else feel like their 'To Be Read' pile is an actual, sentient entity judging them? Because mine definitely is. I walk into my living room and I swear I can hear the whispers from the towering stacks: ""Psst, remember me? You bought me six months ago!"" Then there's the newer arrivals, still crisp and smelling of fresh paper, practically radiating anticipation from their spot on the coffee table. It's a beautiful, terrifying landscape of literary dreams.

I just can't stop buying them, even though I know, deep down, I'll never catch up. The thrill of discovery in a bookstore, finding that hidden gem, or succumbing to a perfectly marketed new release online... it's like a siren song I can't resist. My shelves are groaning under the weight, my Kindle is bursting at the seams, and I've practically barricaded myself in with all the unread masterpieces. There's a part of me that loves the abundance, the sheer *potential* of all those stories waiting. It’s like having a hundred different adventures just a page-turn away.

But then the anxiety hits. Am I truly appreciating them if I'm just accumulating? Will I ever get to that classic I promised myself I'd read this year? What if the next book I read isn't as good as the one I *could* have picked from the pile? It's a first-world problem, I know, but it feels so real! My reading pace just can't keep up with my buying habits, and it's a constant, delightful, agonizing struggle.

It’s not just the physical books either. My library holds list is perpetually 10-15 deep, and every time one becomes available, it feels like a mini-crisis. ""Do I drop what I'm reading for this?!"" The struggle is real, folks. The struggle is very, very real.

So, fellow book dragons, how do you manage your ever-growing TBR? Do you have a system? Or are you, like me, just embracing the beautiful chaos? Spill your secrets!",1,1768249365.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1qb62ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuenosAires/comments/1qb62ag/is_there_a_buenos_aires_version_of_the_oslo_dawn/,Is there a Buenos Aires version of the “Oslo Dawn Patrol”? 🚴‍♂️🌅,"I’m moving to Buenos Aires for about six months from May/June 2026 and I’m trying to find out whether something similar to what we have in Oslo already exists in BA.

Oslo Dawn Patrol (ODP) is a simple concept:

* Meet-up at 05:40 Tuesdays and Thursdays. Group instruction by the ""road captain"" before we ride.
* Same route every time – appr 35 km at a steady pace (appr. 27-28 km/h)
* No racing, just disciplined group riding
* Ride ends at a café – some join for coffee while others ride back home or to work

The idea is the ritual: ride through a quiet city, watch the sun come up, then go into the workday already having done something meaningful. In the winter, the group is smaller. During summer, there might be 150 riders showing up. [Check out their Insta account](https://www.instagram.com/oslodawnpatrol/) or [this 11 min video blog about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FehZVnV-LNQ&t=408s).

**Does anything like this exist in Buenos Aires?**  
If not, I might consider starting some sort of version of ODP in BA from June 2026. I’ll likely be based in Palermo Soho.

We yell at each other, we argue with our superiors, and we move the fuck on more often than not.

So, this girl started. (I’m also a woman, for the record) She is not a team player, which would be fine at most dealerships, but here we are all very tight knit. 

We hang out at each others houses, we smoke after work, we get drinks, we share the big moments with the whole store. We do the grunt work together, and give each other deals in exchange for coffee, and when the managers ask us to do stuff we ALL hate, we ALL participate and make it fun. It’s an innate piece of our stores culture. Despite us all being pure commission, we try to make sure everyone eats. We want everyone to be successful salespeople, so us vets take time to coach our green peas. 

She does not help when we do “lot rodeo”, she doesn’t take cars to get gas when they’re low from test drives, she doesn’t park her “dead wood”, she steals customers from others, lies to the managers and team about whether or not she’s done her job properly, etc etc. 

She just got our longest standing vet fired, for yelling at her when she stole his appointment. In the business, it’s bad form to work someone’s customers when they say “hi i’m here for my appointment with xyz” and she did just that. 

We will not stand for it. She’s stolen from us, but now she not only stole from our sister store as well, but she also got our Fixture Employee fired.

So, my colleagues and I plan to bully her out. She sucks at sales anyways, her customers tell us vets that she was rude or made them uncomfortable on a regular basis. ",0,1768249255.0,offmychest,3,0.25,False
1qb5ymf,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1qb5ymf/where_should_i_live/,Where Should I Live,"My parents passed away and I’m about to inherit half interest in two properties. I could continue renting my current apartment which I will own with a brother. Or I can buy out the interest in my childhood home and live there.



Option 1 - My current place is about 750 sq ft. 2 bedroom one bath place. It’s a duplex and I live in the front unit.  It’s a little small for me long-term, very low on storage, and laundry hookup is in an outdoor utility closet. Last winter I noticed it would smell like mold after a rain. I thought we fixed it by fixing the sidewalk, but the issue has appeared again this winter. Otherwise I love the small space. Also I guess as an owner I can actually look into the issue and get it fixed? No one would be more motivated than me to fix it, but I have no clue what the scope of this recent issue is.



I feel very cozy, and everything I need is within easy reach. I have a dog, and taking her out is easy. There there is a dog park about a mile away, so I will regularly pop her in the car and take her to the park. There is a city park with lots of trees and bike trails there as well. I have two close friends, and we will bike or walk to a neighborhood bar/restaurant and to the beach regularly. I know most of my neighbors, and it feels like a true neighborhood. I am a few blocks from the beach in a rather touristy area, but where I am stays pretty quiet. Nearby grocery stores, coffee shops, and farmers market.



Option 2 – My family home with many memories attached. My parents designed and built this house themselves decades ago. My dad helped lay the foundation. It’s a 3 bedroom, 3.5 bath with a bonus office room and basement. The top level is my parent’s room with two massive closets and a massive balcony with panoramic views. It’s half a block from a state park and a block and a half from the ocean. The beach up there is more private, as there are no hotels nearby, but no nearby bars or restaurants. It’s about a 15 minute drive from my current place.



I would say a good portion of the houses on the street are not occupied full time. They are vacation homes or short term rentals. So I wouldn’t have the neighborhood the same way I do now. But I would have a lot of amenities I don’t now: a massive cozy living room, a huge kitchen with lots of storage, a gorgeous deck and sunrise from bed every morning. I could even turn the basement into an efficiency and rent it out during the summer. However the cost of this property would be very high. The siding is looking rough. There are a few windows that look from the outside like they need attention. The freezer in the kitchen isn’t working. And it costs a lot for heating and cooling (3-4x more than I currently pay). I would have similar access to the beach and a park, but just a quieter version of both. Also, it is a tall skinny house and I worry about my dog getting old in a house with so many steps.



I was raised here and  my sister lives a few blocks away, but it’s a lot of house for me to manage as a single lady. It’s also a very unique location and my heart jumps for joy at the idea of living there. It feels like a dream, but the logistics of it, imagining how that house and lifestyle would change my life are so hard to picture. I worry I would be trading the community I have built for more space in a sterile neighborhood.

 

I feel like I’m so confused as well because I have momentum at my current place. I’m used to getting by with my tiny apartment. It is just fine. I don’t know if moving to a quieter neighborhood with more space in a house I love is worth leaving a house and lifestyle that I am comfortable in. It’s small, but cozy with a lot of amenities nearby. The two spaces are equal distances from my work in opposite directions, so that’s not a factor. It would be a completely different lifestyle than I’m living now. I would trade dive bars with friends and a walkable area for a semi-private beach and lots of outdoor time but more of a bike ride or short drive away from things.



Buying out the other half of the family house would be expensive but I can afford it with my inheritance. I didn't think I would ever leave my current neighborhood, but for this beautiful sentimental house I think I would be willing to make the trade? I just feel so unsure of it all. And my default state is jus to stay where I am, which feels like I'm not actually making a decision, just letting the decision happen for me.

 

TLDR:

Option 1 – My current place. Small duplex apartment. Easy access to bars, restaurants, beach, dog park, friends nearby, neighborhood feel. Small, storage is an issue, but in exchange my bills are pretty cheap. Potential mold issue, so that would make it a health issue for me. But also, I would inherit half interest in this place, so I have the means to fix the issue. I am comfortable here, but it does feel like I would be cramped long-term. I really do have a place in a walkable area with things to do, but with easy access to nature. It feels like the dream. Other than the size and maybe mold.



Option 2 – Large childhood home. No nearby restaurants/bars, my friends are further away. Right next to state park with lots of trails and a quieter beach. Have my sister right down the road. More room and more storage, but I’m also living alone and without the same neighborhood feel. It’s much more expensive both initial purchase and monthly. I could have a rental unit in the basement. My parents built this place, and I'm told the foundation is solid. The exterior and fridge will need some maintenance soon. I would still be a 30 minute bike ride or 15ish minute drive away from friends. The location is also a dream. Living a block from a forest or the beach with a rooftop deck for sunsets feels like an impossible location, and I can have it along with all the sentimental value of my childhood home.

I’m a 29 year old male from North-West Indiana and my preferred genre is Drum and Bass, but I’m also a big fan of dubstep.  I don’t tend to listen to much riddim (I know it’s huge right now, especially in the city), but I can listen to basically any genre just fine. House is a favorite, albeit I have a hard time partaking in house concerts, not for a lack of enjoying the music.  I was hoping I could find some friends in the area that have a similar taste in music and would enjoy going to concerts together, or even occasionally hanging out outside of them.  My old group slowly fell apart as friends went their separate ways or everybody found themselves in relationships and slowed down on shows or just shut me out as a third wheel.  What friends I have left are mostly riddim lovers and I just don’t find myself enjoying their shows like I did the more regular dubstep they’d always want to go to.  I enjoy coffee, cafes, going out to eat, nature, and I am fine with people that roll, albeit those days are mostly over for me since I am working on a career change soon.  I have a car and usually drive myself to shows, and if you’re in my area and we’re fine riding together I’m not opposed to meeting up and taking you up with me.  Other things I enjoy are anime (isekai is my favorite genre, otherwise I watch a lot of magic/fantasy) and I like to game (I’m on PC, I like survival builders like Minecraft and Ark, but also used to play hella Marvel Rivals until my group petered out).   

I’ll be going to Alleycvt with some friends this Friday, Ghengar with another buddy on the 24th, and I’m MOST excited about Hybrid Minds on the 31st.  I’ll also be doing my second year of Electric Forest this year!

Looking for perspective,"I'm turning 40 soon and decided to give myself a proper gift: an almost month-long solo journey to my dream destination, New Zealand. 

I'll be there from late February until the first half of March. I start off in Christchurch where I'll be renting a solo-van and focusing entirely on the South Island. Aiming for slow travel rather than ticking boxes ""instagram-style"": lots of nature, day walks, hikes, small towns, local experiences, and time to be just on the road alone (this will be a sabbatical of sorts).

I've done some initial research and I want to visit some of the places that made LOTR films famous (so definitely Mount Cook area, etc.), but I'm almost intentionally leaving gaps to stay flexible and not have a day-to-day itinerary planned down to the last coffeeshop stop. This has been my recent travel mantra: have some checkpoints prepared so you're not completely lost, but enjoy the unexpected surprises on the way.

For those who've travelled solo in the South Island, I have a couple of questions, and would appreciate if you shared your experience.

Were there places that surprised you in an unexpectedly good way?

Anything you wish you'd slowed down for, spent an extra day;   
or vice versa - anything you'd skip if you went again?

And honestly, I'm completely unsure about what weather to expect. I read Feb/March is the last stretch of summer, so I expected warmer weather (it's currently -10C where I am), but at the same time summer in the South Island probably looks and feels different from the super-warm summers of Europe. Any hints regarding the weather?

While I enjoy traveling alone as much as any of you I believe, I am always happy to chat with fellow travellers or locals along the way, either over a coffee, or on a walk.
