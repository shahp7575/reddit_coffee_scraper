I’m heading to BGC today to do some research for a project. I don’t usually go there unless it’s to hang out, so I’m not super familiar with the area. Since I’ll already be out, I figured I might as well get some work done too—so it’s looking like a full-day thing.

That said, I get a bit restless when I’m alone too long, so if anyone’s free to hang out, keep me company, or just grab coffee or lunch, hit me up! Would be nice to have someone around to break up the day.

- Completely SFW (I just want to get some work done)
- KKB 
- I will be walking around A LOT
- Pref yung familiar sa BGC

*The Complete Set of Discourses on* **the GREAT PERFECTION DHARMA Vol.2 by H.H. Living Buddha Lian Sheng.**

*Note: 'Living Buddha' is the Chinese translation of the Tibetan word 'Tulku'.*

**Vajrayana practices require empowerment from an authentic Vajra Acharaya Master**

*Discourse given at Rainbow Temple, North Bend, Washington, USA on Sept. 29,2013 following the Amoghapasa Avalokiteshvara Homa Ceremony*

We will continue with the Dzogchen discourses. Yesterday I discussed Treasure Vase Qi. I should talk about inner fire today, as the purpose of practicing Treasure Vase Qi is to kindle the inner fire. But, for me, I practiced on achieving non-leakage before inner fire. Why? Because if you still have leakage, the lower half of your body will be weak and cold, and you will not be able to gather qi to keep the temperature there warm. There is a Taiwanese saying: If you shrink below, you will always leak.

This is not easy to explain. If you have non-leakage, your inner fire will be easily kindled. The ""capital,"" which is firewood, in your abdomen, lends it easy to kindle a fire. If you often leak below, you will have insufficient firewood in your abdomen. Without the kindling, how can you raise the inner fire? That is why I propose cultivating non-leakage first.

Hence, today I will talk about non-leakage, which I have also discussed in my Hevajra Discourses. Basically, in Vajrayana energy practices, one has to practice qi with Baoping Qi, then non-leakage, followed by inner fire, and drops. What are the benefits of non-leakage? It brings on a great bliss. What is bliss? Friction generates bliss. Non-leakage brings you a great bliss while leakage brings you a minor bliss. With leakage, the duration and distance of friction ar both short.

Here is a joke:

*In men's restrooms, pee droplets are often collected below the urinals. Someone decided to post a sign above the urinals ""Move forward one step to keep the drops from dripping outside th urinal."" But there was no improvement. People were still stepping o others' pee. Finally, someone posted another sign: ""If you drip when you pee, it means you are short."" From then on, the area below the urinals remained dry.*

In general, people who ""shrink below"" will have a dripping problem People in good health are able to discharge their urine quickly and to a far distance. People in weak health or old age are unable to discharge their urine far away and in fact still drip after urinating. That explains the droplets of urine below the urinals. If you have strong yang qi in you, you can shoot your urine very far and be done with it in one shot! There won't be any dripping on your trousers, the ground or wherever you are stepping on. For some people, they also get incontinence during illnesses, because during those times they do not have the strength to hold onto the water. The practice of non-leakage gets rid of this problem. As your bladder becomes very strong, drops in storage will be kept tightly, like having a very tight sluice that keeps water in the reservoir from spilling. In non-leakage, the water in the reservoir is always full, but due to a very tight floodgate, there is no flood discharge.

There are two aspects to the practice of non-leakage. One concerns visualization, and the other techniques. 

Here is a joke. 

*One day Newton spoke to an old lady, ""Grandma, I have discovered gravity The old lady looked at her own drooping breasts, and slapped Newton hard with a whack! She then said, ""I know you have found out a lot."" This does not seem that funny, but there is a connection. Everything sags, unless you have the power to lift them up. Due to the Earth's gravitational force, everything is pulled downward*

 If you succeed in non-leakage, you will rise and not sag. This is the significance of non leakage. Additionally, you will have vigorous yang qi plus many other benefits.

At the beginning of practicing non-leakage, you have to employ the Vajra Finger Mudra. I do not like to form the Vajra Finger Mudra because people might mistake me to be giving them the finger. But, indeed, the mudra of Vajrasattva is the Vajra Finger Mudra. Every time when I form the Vajra Finger Mudra, I will cover it with my other hand so you cannot see it. Otherwise, you will say, ""Eh? How come Grand Master is giving us the middle finger?"" In fact, this is a mudra. People in the world mistake this Vajrayana mudra for a cursing gesture. What joke is this? Such a mudra also exists in Taoism Wang Tianjun [the chief of the thirty-six heavenly lords in Taoism] also forms this mudra. He holds a whip with one hand and this mudra with the other hand. Is Wang Tianjun cursing you? No, he is holding the Vajra Finger Mudra. This is also the genuine Vajrasattva Mudra. It is very troublesome that the public regards this mudra as a cursing gesture. That is why I hold this mudra downward instead of upward.

[Grand Master demonstrates.]

Assume the posture that the Vajra Finger is inserted into the crown aperture, the orifice through which your soul exits. Visualize a red Hum seed syllable standing in the center of your navel chakra. The lower hook of this vertical Hum extends all the way to right below the secret chakra to hook onto a white lotus right outside the secret chakra. You have to do this visualization. A red Hum in your abdomen Its hook extends to the secret chakra and beyond to hook onto a white lotus. For females, it is a red lotus. The white lotus represents the white bodhi in males, while the red lotus represents the red bodhi in females. Then, with a series of ""Hum,"" you elevate the qi to rush towards your crown so that a red protrusion forms there. Next the white lotus comes up to the crown. As a result, the red Hum is now pulled all the way up to the uppermost spot, still hooking onto the white lotus. Below the white lotus is the crown protrusion. In other words, at the uppermost is the Hum from your abdomen, below which is the white lotus, and below which is the crown protrusion. The crown protrusion is actually the vajra scepter of a male. This is your visualization. During this practice, you call out a series of ""Hum"" by emitting the sounds with the lips closed while pressing qi downward This way, you pull the Hum syllable to the top. At the uppermost is the Hum syllable, with the white bodhi and crown protrusion below. It is the same for female practitioners. Call out Hum and set a vibration to lift up the Hum syllable until it reaches the crown, followed by the red lotus which is the red bodhi. There are also technical methods, which I have talked about many times.

Here is a joke. 

*I asked my son, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" He said he wanted to be an OBGYN doctor. I asked him, ""Why?"" He said, ""An OBGYN doctor is the only profession that can ask women to take off their clothes, and then even get paid by their husbands.""*

This joke is too much. 

Men and women have different body structures. Women do not have crown protrusions, only the red lotus and the red Hum syllable. Men have crown protrusions, also the white lotus and the red Hum syllable. All these are visualizations. When you practice non-leakage, you will become very strong. This occurs because you are frequently lifting the Hum syllable upward, a motion that will set the central channel into vibrations. Like yesterday I did this vibration exercise while sitting on the chair and lifting the body. [Grand Master demonstrates.] The legs can also be lifted. Lifting while using this kind of qi and strength will cause the central channel to become very straight. This is power. Do this often, you will be energized,free of malaise, and will not hunch over. I have been doing so much writing every day that I am a little hunched over. Lifting the qi keeps my chest and spirit up.

Here is a joke:

*A boss said, ""I have brought back a lot of coffee from abroad.Have a drink!"" After everyone drank the coffee, the boss asked his staff how they felt. The staff said, ""The coffee is indeed good. W now feel totally refreshed."" The boss said, ""Since you are not sleepy, you can work overtime tonight.""*

 Indeed, the practice of non-leakage keeps you refreshed, healthy, strong in the abdomen, and you will be able to shoot a stream of pee over a great distance. Grade school students line up at the playground to compete to see who can pee the farthest away. Those of good health are guaranteed to win while those of poor health will lose. You need strength in your bladder and the lower body to win. This is of utmost importance.

If you often engage in this kind of qi guidance practice, using the red Hum to guide the white bodhi along the central channel all the way to the crown, you will develop a power in your frame. Like yesterday I lifted my body up, then dropped it. [Grand Master demonstrates.] It is okay to fall like this. One of the Vajra Fists exercises is to hit the ground with your butt, causing your five chakras, the brow-point chakra, throat chakra, heart chakra, navel chakra, and generative chakra, to vibrate. This will open all the channels and meridians in your body. Why do you have sicknesses and pains? It indicates blockages and inflammation in those areas. Engaging in these vibration exercises while standing is known as ""emitting Ha while shaking the body,"" the last step in the Vajra Fists exercises. First, you cry out""Ha,"" then you jump, and when you come down, you shake your entire body-this is ""daha doushen (emitting Ha while shaking the body)"" If you are sitting, lift your body up, then set it down again.

What I have mentioned above are inner practices. There are external techniques in non-leakage practice, and their purpose is to elevate the drops. First, roll both your eyes upward; this method is called ""sun and moon facing the sky."" What are your eyes gazing at? Your own yidam deity in the empty space. Both eyes are closed when gazing upward.When the phenomenon of leakage is about to happen, you do this and you will immediately bring your focus back to the yidam deity and you can hold onto non-leakage.

Next, ""touch your tongue against the upper palate""-this allows the upper and lower qi to connect. Next, ""press down upon the Adam's apple."" I gave many examples of this last time. Pressing down on the Adam's apple prevents downward qi from pushing out and drops from being released. I gave this analogy last time. When you put a straw in a glass of water and press down on the upper end of the straw, you can lift up water inside the straw without leaking. Pressing down on the Adam's apple does the same thing. If you release your finger from th straw's top, water will rush out below. It is the same principle. Pressing upon the Adam's apple keeps qi inside and the downward qi will not be discharged and the drops will not be released. If you loosen up, qi goes down and drops will naturally rush out.

The fourth technique is ""pressing the abdomen against the back. Maneuver the abdominal strength upward so that drops will be held inside your body instead of getting discharged. Another step is moving all upward qi out."" When you press upon the Adam's apple, you keep qi stationary. When you loosen your hand, water will drip downward. But if you can lift the upper qi, water can rise up. So, in moving all upward qi out, which is exhaling the qi above, water will rise up. Newton discovered gravity which explains why water always flows downward. But, if you can get rid of the qi inside the straw which is above the water, water will ascend. 
The last technique is ""constricting the anal sphincter"" to raise the anus. 

These six postures are known as the Six Sakya Techniques: 

""sun and moon facing the sky,"" 

""tongue against upper palate,"" 

""pressing down on the Adam's apple,

""abdomen against the back"" 

""moving all upward qi out"" 

and 

""constricting the anal sphincter"" 

When you develop the sensation that your drops are at the verge of turning into bliss, before that happens, you must be able to turn back this discharge of drops.These are known as the Six Sakya Techniques. With practice, you can in an instant accomplish all six techniques. Non-leakage practice consists of visualizations as well as these six physical techniques. It is of course not easy to accomplish. But, with practice and once you succeed, you do not just strengthen your basic structure, you also accumulate the resources to raise the inner fire. Without the resources, how can you raise the inner fire? It will be impossible.

Living in the world today, we must have a reason to keep on living. This is how the joke goes.

*Instant noodles have gone up in price, so have the cost of eggs, flour, gas, vegetables, oil, cotton, and clothing. Except for wages, everything around us seems to have gone up in price. But we still have to be strong and keep on living, because even the costs of graves have gone up.*

Government agencies now face some pretty bad times. There are venting rooms where pictures of leaders are hung, and disgruntled employees can go and vent their anger. Like in Taiwan, throwing shoes is a kind of venting anger. 

*One day, the manager of the venting room walked into the room and saw his picture still in a perfect condition while the pictures of all other managers were badly damaged. This manager was very happy to see this. The housekeeper said to him, ""We haven't had a chance to change the other portraits. We have already changed your picture three times.""* 

So, he was in an even worse situation.

Non-leakage practice does not mean there is no venting at all. I have asked a medical doctor if it produces any ill effect on the body. According to the doctor, if you do not vent, that stuff still sits around and it can deteriorate and adversely affect your health. That is why after you succeed in non-leakage practice, you must cultivate inner fire. When you generate fire below, the fire will transform the drops into vapor. When vapor ascends, it will reach each blood vessel and every skin-pore, and your hormones will increase. If you only know non-leakage and cannot raise the inner fire, you can also get sick because the drops will become corrupt if you don't use them. You must use an abdominal power, the fire in your abdomen, to turn the drops into vapor so they can ascend. This is another skill. After non-leakage, you must work on the inner fire. After raising the inner fire vaporize the drops to move them into all channels, meridians, and joints. This is the principle of good health.

If you often get sick, practicing non-leakage will keep you in good health, because your body temperature will go up. The weather has been very cold, and it is easy to catch cold. If weather is fickle, suddenly hot, then suddenly cold, it is easy to catch cold. If your body is strong your qi is vigorous, your drops and hormones are plentiful, you will have strong immunity and not catch cold easily. But, if you have not raised the inner fire, your body temperature has not increased, and your drops have not been vented, you also will get sick in the future These are the keys to a strong and vigorous body.

*A director asked, ""Didn't we discuss this yesterday that you have to show your 'san dian' today?"" The actress said, ""It is already past 'san dian' now, so I won't show my 'san dian."" [San dian is a play on the homophones for ""three spots"" and ""three o'clock.""] The director did not know how to respond, so he asked again, ""Didn't we discuss this yesterday that you have to show your 'san dian' today? How come you are only showing two spots?"" The actress replied, ""I have 'yi dian' [one spot or a touch] of not feeling well, so I am only showing two spots.""*

As practitioners, we must keep our bodies from not feeling well. You cannot practice when you are unwell. ""I am feeling very weak today, so I don't have the energy to do my practice"" How can you practice this way? People who cultivate qi will not catch cold. People who cultivate inner fire will not be afraid of cold. People who cultivate drops will not say, ""I have bad eyesight."" They will not say they cannot hear well or have this or that health problem. One time when it was just as cold as today, I said,""It is so cold today!"" A person next to me said, ""Grand Master, don't you have the inner fire?"" What I meant was that that day was colder than the day before. Can't I even say that? When I say ""it is cold today,"" it does not mean I am afraid of the cold. I am merely making a statement that ""today is colder than yesterday, or ""it seems cold for a summer day.""

It seems that I cannot make any statement casually. I cannot say either that ""my eyesight is not very good today."" ""Eh? Grand Master, have you not been practicing the drops? You should have enough hormones in you. How can you be like this?"" It is indeed quite miserable! It seems that I cannot even get sick. Indeed, I seldom ask for a day off on Saturday or Sunday. I cannot even mention it is cold. ""Don't you have the inner fire?"" I cannot speak about cold! Look at me, in the winter, what shoes do I wear? I only wear sandals even when it snows! One time, a reporter interviewed me. It was all white and snowing outside. The reporter kept looking at my feet. He said, ""Strange. It is snowing and everyone has wrapped their feet up. How come you are still showing your skin on your feet?"" I replied,"" I do not have any warm clothing either!"" I rolled up my sleeves and I was not wearing any thermal underwear either! This is all I wear even when it is snowing. Grand Master has been living in Seattle and has never worn any long thermal clothing underneath, right? Never, just like this only.

In Tibet, unlike Seattle here with only one building, a temple compound has many hall: a main temple with the Dharma protector hall, vajra hall, wisdom kings' hall, dakini hall, daka hall,and deva hall to the sides, as well as other structures built by individual lamas, so altogether it is a huge complex. When a practitioner devoted his retreat to cultivate the inner fire and succeeded,he had to wear a very short pair of pants and only an undershirt above and walk once around the monastery compound. It took half a day, or at least several hours, to circumambulate the compound once! This signified that he had achieved success with the inner fire. One had to wear thin clothing and walk once around the monastery compound on a frozen snowy day. This was then considered an accomplishment.

Non-leakage has many benefits. First, it allows you to open the central channel. When you visualize, you are working on opening the central channel. It will also generate a great bliss. Why? This kind of bliss is an eternal bliss, just like the kind experienced by Dharma brother Kao Ming Lu.cHe was able to lift his drops, and the drops were actually vibrating inside the central channel. This vibration happened when the drops rubbed against the central channel, engendering a great bliss in him. Once this great bliss occurs, one enters into meditative stability very easily. With this kind of bliss in one's heart, when one sits down in a full lotus position to meditate, one will enter into stability amidst a warm bliss. This is called ""yu le ding"" ""Yu"" is desire, ""le"" is bliss, and ""ding"" is stability. In Dharma brother Kao's case, the drops opened up the central channel and remained vibrating in the central channel for twelve to twenty-four hours. This kind of bliss is called great bliss. The kind of bliss ordinary people experience is only a little bliss. But such a little bliss already makes men think they are in heaven. The same goes for women, the little bliss also makes them think they are in heaven. Yet the great bliss lets you experience the friction for twenty-four hours while the drops keep on vibrating inside the central channel. It is a very long duration of bliss.

Hence, the bliss of non-leakage greatly exceeds the little bliss of ordinary people. I am explaining to you that you can get great bliss meditative stability, the opening of central channel, and the prevention of diseases. Herein lies its significance. Non-leakage also builds vigorous qi. When your central channel opens, you can see light-this is a principle of Vajrayana. When you see light, you will definitely achieve great success in Dzogchen. We will stop here today.

1mmvk99,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1mmvk99/hopefully_given_you_all_some_hope/,Hopefully given you all some hope!,"Hoping this helps Atleast one person!  In January I had a pretty bad head cold that lasted about 3 weeks. After that head cold it left me with a lump in my throat( felt like a lump of drainage) that made it feel like I was choking. This also left me having a hard time swallowing any food and everything felt like it was getting stuck. It would go straight to my chest and give me instant chest pain. I would be asleep at night and would wake up coughing.  I went to PCP, GI,ENT. PCP and gi was not helpful at all. Did have a EGD that was completely clear- no Inflammation, no hiatal hernia. After EGD I talked to the doctor and asked what else it go be since the EGD was clear- she said “I don’t know, keep in touch” and walked out. So literally no help. I referred my own self to an ENT because just from researching I thought I had LPR(my pcp had no clue what it even was” he was a great help. I had. Massive sinus infection and had to take 3 rounds of antibiotics. He put me on a strict diet (mainly veggies and meat) because after an allergy test he said I was reacting to gluten, dairy, wheat, etc. I put myself on the Dr Kauffman diet for 2 months and while it did help, I was at an all time low mentally, lots of anxiety and would even react to things I’ve always had my entire life (my tongue broke out after eating watermelon) 

So at this point no one really tried to find out my root cause so I decided to search for myself. So I went back to researching to see WHY all of this started on the first place. Why am I reacting to food all of a sudden. This issue has multiple reasons. Could be hiatal hernia, gut infection, vagal nerve dysfunction, diet. So with google and chat GPT😂 this led me to vagal nerve dysfunction. (As if my body’s vagal nerve went crazy during the sickness and has just stayed out of whack) so that led me to chiropractic care which could help with vagal nerve issue. So that led me to search for vagal nerve chiropractors in my town. This didn’t give me a lot of results, except for an Instagram post for this one chiropractor/functional med MD talking about reflux and vagal nerve dysfunction. So I made an appointment. I literally prayed the entire way there that maybe this could be answer.

So I met with the most amazing functional md/chiropractor. I felt almost instant relief which I walked into the room. I told her my entire story and diagnosis of LPR. “I actually have that diagnosis too.” UMM… WHAT!?!?!? you what!?!. She had my exact diagnosis and healed herself from it. I thought I was going to literally break down into tears, and it still gives me chills thinking of it. She literally gave me all the tools/supplements to hopefully get me out of this mess.

So please use this to your discretion! Her LPR was from a hiatal hernia and I believe mine is vagus nerve. She only has flare ups ever now and then if she over does it but she is good now. I am NOT going back on a strict diet but just being more mindful, no coffee, nothing acidic, no spices. Here was she recommended. I told her I will do whatever she says 😂😂😂😂

1mmvjj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mmvjj5/sp_coffee/,[SP] Coffee,"You raise the cup to your lips, inside is a drink you've had many times before, a sweet caramel latte. You feel the shape of the cup as you raise it to take a sip, the way the drink warms your frozen hands, the cup fitting perfectly in the crevices of your fingers, too perfectly. You notice a distinct smoky smell, one of slightly burned milk, not burnt enough to make it undrinkable, but enough to make you squint. You take the first sip, noting the hotness that burns the tip of your tongue ever so slightly, the subtle sweetness woven with a bitter aftertaste of the coffee, the warm liquid oozing down your throat in a comforting manner, as if almost to say “hey, i’m here, wake up”.

You enjoy the experience and take in your surroundings as you continue to drink. The sun beaming through the window, casting a shadow of your cup directly next to you. You hear a mundane passing conversation, feel your phone vibrate against your leg, and hear kids running down the street as you set down your cup. You expect to be awake, yet a persistent sleepiness clings stubbornly, refusing to loosen its grip. You try again, this time with a different form. The forms are endlessly twisting at your will, yet somehow always lacklustre. This time an iced americano perhaps? 

The cup transforms into one appropriate for the drink and you watch as it fills itself from the bottom up. Soon the cup is filled with a dark rich shade of espresso mixed with filtered water and a bittersweet syrup you can’t quite place. The ice inside cracked from the hot espresso that was poured on it. You notice every dent and crack. You lift the cup again, this time feeling a shiver run through you as your hands meet the cold exterior. Once again, the cup fits perfectly in your hands, just like the first, but this time the smell is sharper, colder, unmistakably bitter. One that cuts through to the bone, sending goosebumps all over your body. You take your first sip and this time a chilling cold meets your tongue, the sharp taste of the watered down espresso swirls around your mouth before eventually pushing through, you cringe at the tart flavour left behind in your mouth.

As you continue to drink, your surroundings
begin to change. The once sunny exterior grows dark and secluded. Instead of sun beaming through, you notice raindrops splattering across the window, in an almost poetic manner, as if they were speaking to you. You hear the muffled chatter of passers-by hurrying to escape the rain and the screeching whistle of the wind, seeming to almost speed up by the second. You feel cold, yet you are still sleepy.

This cycle continues, each cup shifting slightly. Different shapes, different temperatures, new tastes. Though you begin to notice small imperfections: faint stains along the rims, tiny cracks formed in the glass. Were those there before? You lift the last cup and, in your mind, trace all the small discrepancies from those before it. It’s as if each drink, though unique, carries the same lingering flaws, almost mirroring one another. Echoes of previous attempts, never perfect, always marked by imperfection.

The room turns blinding white, leaving only you and the table before you. Your vision sharpens just as the putrid smell of old, stale coffee fills the room, creeping into your nostrils and stirring your gag reflex. You cover your mouth, unable to stop yourself from retching. Your eyes water uncontrollably, your senses overwhelmed, and spiralling, as the oppressive stench lingers like a shadow you cannot shake.

As you look around, you notice all the half empty cups you abandoned, all of which are stained, cracked, ringed with mould. Flies drift lazily over their surface, some alive, some dead, who can tell any more? These are all the cups you had discarded in your mind as if they never existed. All the ones you thought were too sweet, too bitter, never quite right. They linger here now, forgotten yet undeniable. All the ones you had left behind, searching for that elusive ‘one’ — the one that would finally wake you up.",1,1754863441.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We are a family of four with one older adult with severe mobility issues, one older adult with some hiking abilities and two 20-something kids who are extremely fit and into hiking.  We also had to deal with very hot afternoons which were a challenge since we stayed at curry village and the accesible tent was in direct sun, so no relaxing there in the afternoon:

Sunday: Arrived in fresno 7pm. Drove one hour to Oakhurst and stayed overnight (thinking: driving appears more treacherous past oskhurst and this was confirmed on trip.)

Monday:  got up at 6:45 am and enjoyed huge best western hotel complimentary breakfast.

8:15 am drove about 25 min to gate of Yosemite.  No wait whatsoever.

8:45am. Arrived Mariposa Grove and did lower loop hike which took about an hour and was a fantastic warmup.  Crowds arriving behind us but our timing was perfect.  We loved it!  Adult with mobility issues wished they had obtained a handicap sign for car because you can literally drive up if you have one.  But using hiking poles they were able to get around mini loop and see trees.  All happy!

10:45-1130.  Drove to valley, stopped at tunnel view.  While this was terrific, we realized we Should have done glacier point on the way. But we were all excited and wanted to see valley.

12:15. Stop at Bridalveil falls, gorgeous little hike.  Adult with mobility issue found a viewing platform. Kids happy scaling rocks.

1mmvj38,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1mmvj38/americans_dont_have_a_coffee_addictionthey_have_a/,Americans don't have a coffee addiction-they have a sugar addiction,"To my American black coffee drinkers, this is not about you

 I live in the U.S and I constantly see adults, students, and even mere children no older than the age of 13 drink coffee constantly. Typically, this coffee is store-bought, mostly from Dunkin or Starbucks. Now I don't have a problem with people consuming whatever they want, as of course it does not affect me.

What I do have a problem with is how people rave about how much they can't survive without coffee and how they have to drink it at work because they need the ""caffeine kick"" (mind you, these people are usually the ones to have a Caramel Frappuccino in their hands). This is pure misinformation. Sharon, you are not looking for a caffeine kick; you are looking for a sugar kick.

According to the National Coffee Association, 60% of Americans add some sort of sweetener, cream, or flavored syrup into their coffees. This is 60% of the more than 200 million Americans who drink coffee every day. Millions of Americans buy coffee from Starbucks and Dunkin (about 80 million in sales each month combined). What's their best seller, you ask? Pumpkin Spice Latte, Caramel Macchiato, Iced Latte/Coffee with flavored swirls, etc. I did the math, and the average sugar in their top 5 bestselling medium drinks is about 39 grams of sugar. That is more than 100% of the recommended grams of sugar you should be consuming per day.

When people say they can't skip their daily coffee because they will get a headache, become moody, etc, it is very likely they are just facing sugar withdrawal symptoms. Sugar activates the brain way more than caffeine, which can cause you to become more addicted easily than if you were to drink coffee without sugar. When you get used to having a high amount of sugar in one sitting, you often become dependent. Becoming dependent means that without it, you get withdrawal symptoms, and as for coffee drinkers, this can be irritation, fatigue, headaches, etc.

Look, I don't care what you eat, drink, or do, but please stop saying you love coffee if you order an iced latte with 8 pumps of vanilla, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and cookie crumbs. You want a milkshake, not coffee.

1mmvi7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mmvi7b/a_letter_to_my_sun/,A letter to my Sun,"I wrote this text as a goodbye to someone who reached the deepest parts of my heart. Right now, it feels so important to share my feelings, so here it is — for all of you.





Hello.  
  
It’s been ages since I last wrote anything by hand, but ChatGPT and some random lady on YouTube said it’s a good practice to cope with pain. And I’m in pain.  
I’m trying to process a loss and all that, you know?  
  
Yesterday was much worse — I could only sit and stare at the water. But today I can smile again. That means it’s getting a little better. Hopefully tomorrow it will be even easier. I just want to drift away from this feeling.  
  
There’s so much I didn’t get to say, so I’m writing you this letter — but I’ll never send it.  
  
Before our meeting yesterday, I was ready for many things.  
I was ready to apologize if I had done something wrong that night at your place.  
I was ready to help you figure out your feelings, I wanted so much to be there for you, to support you with all my heart and soul.  
I wanted to be in this together with you — it felt important, right… it was right.  
  
But you said, “Quiet. Nothing.”  
And for that, I wasn’t ready.  
  
In therapy, I had talked about the possibility of such a turn of events, and I told myself I’d be ready — that it would hurt, but I’d be ready.  
I lied.  
I wasn’t ready at all.  
Your words hit like a sledgehammer in my ears, ringing after the blow, and the second strike shattered my heart.  
  
I tried my best to keep a calm face, to thank you for your honesty, to say it would make it easier for me. Like that “emotionally mature” person who doesn’t make a scene. But no, it’s not easier! Not better!  
I wanted to burst into tears right in front of you. I wanted to ask — why? As if you yourself knew the answer to that stupid question.  
  
I was walking to that silly coffee shop, rehearsing in my head the words I had prepared — yes, prepared! — to tell you my feelings. Can you imagine how ridiculous that is now?  
I was going to tell you how important you had become to me over those two months. I was ready to open my soul to you.  
  
But… “quiet.”  
And my breath caught.  
You couldn’t even look me in the eyes, and I was breaking apart inside.  
  
I just wanted to say that I had fallen for you completely, and that I was ready to do whatever it took to build something beautiful together — you and I.  
  
But you have “quiet.” You have “nothing.”  
And I was NOT ready for that.  
  
So now I’ll take my chance and tell you how I fell in love — with your smile and contagious laugh, with the little sparks in your grey eyes and your fiery red hair, with the moon on your right shoulder, with your soft yet strong hands, and the warmth you gave me just by being near.  
I love the sun so much!  
And you were the sun in my eyes from the very first meeting.  
  
First, I noticed your eyes — studying me with curiosity as the new person in your group.  
Your curly hair was down, and I thought: She’s stunning.  
  
Then I heard your laugh and your delighted exclamation about my socks.  
Such a small thing — just silly socks — and you turned it into a little celebration.  
  
I wasn’t in love yet then, but you were already standing at the door of my heart, waiting for an invitation.  
Though… were you really waiting? I don’t know.  
  
We saw each other again, and I realized we had so much in common.  
It felt so comfortable to just sit and drink coffee with you.  
You kept saying, “You can be whoever you want to be,” — and that was so important to me, I think that’s when I was ready to tear the damn door off its hinges and carry you into my heart in my own arms.  
  
What could go wrong? We got along so well, we had so much in common, there was mutual interest (or so it seemed) — I could fall in love freely!  
You gave me so much support, warmth, and comfort, I thought I had stumbled into a stroke of pure luck. That it was impossible, a dream.  
  
Spoiler: luck wasn’t eternal. And yes, I was right — it was a kind of dream.  
  
Every date felt like a little fairy-tale adventure.  
I felt us getting closer, and I fell, and fell… until I had completely fallen.  
With you, I had no other choice. I was drowning in you, and I wanted to touch the bottom as soon as possible.  
Well, here I am. > Настасья: You became my sun in those two months.  
And I, apparently, didn’t even want to put on sunscreen — so I got burned.  
  
But I’m glad you were in my life.  
You showed me that I can be myself, and that was priceless. Still is.  
Thank you.  
  
I don’t think I’ll forget our time together, our little voyage.  
It was supposed to be a fairy-tale “happily ever after,” but turned out to be a real “fast and painful.” Well… so be it.  
  
It’s strange — every look you gave me, every touch, even your reactions to my touch, they all screamed about your feelings for me. Screamed that there was more than “nothing.”  
But you said “no.”  
And so that’s how it will be.  
  
I have to accept and believe it to be able to let go — even though I don’t want to. God, I don’t want to… if only you knew.  
  
You said you tried to fall in love but it didn’t work. Cruel, but honest.  
And that’s what I wanted — honesty, right?  
  
Your leaving is a hard period at the end of the last sentence.  
Ahead of me is a new page, a new job, a new position.  
I’m afraid I’ll have to start it with pain — but what can I do? I have to move forward. And I will.  
  
Thank you for being.  
I wish you all the best in life — that’s all I can give you now.  
You deserve happiness.  
And so do I.  
  
So I must go.  
  
Goodbye.

# Best Toothpaste for Braces 2025: Expert Reviews

Maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial for everyone, but it becomes even more critical when wearing braces. Traditional brushing can be challenging with brackets and wires, leading to plaque buildup, cavities, and even gum disease. Special toothpastes formulated for braces offer enhanced protection and cleaning power, helping to ensure a healthy and confident smile throughout orthodontic treatment. It is vital to use the right toothpaste to prevent decalcification and staining around the brackets.

Choosing the right toothpaste can be overwhelming with the sheer number of options available. This review focuses on the best toothpastes for braces in 2025, considering factors like fluoride content, abrasiveness, and specialized ingredients. Each product has been carefully evaluated and selected based on its ability to address the unique challenges of orthodontic appliances, empowering you with the knowledge to pick the best treatment for you.

## Key Features Analysis

The best toothpastes for braces incorporate specialized features to effectively clean around brackets, protect enamel, and promote overall oral health. Key elements include high fluoride levels, low abrasiveness, and ingredients designed to fight bacteria and reduce inflammation.**Fluoride Content:** Fluoride is a critical ingredient in any toothpaste, as it strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent cavities. Toothpastes formulated for braces often contain a higher concentration of fluoride, typically around 1450 ppm (parts per million), to provide extra protection against demineralization, a common issue around brackets where plaque can easily accumulate.This increased fluoride content helps to remineralize weakened enamel and protect against acid attacks from bacteria.**Low Abrasiveness:** Abrasiveness refers to the toothpasteS ability to scrub away surface stains and debris.While some abrasiveness is necessary for cleaning, excessively abrasive toothpastes can damage enamel, especially around brackets. Toothpastes specifically designed for braces are usually formulated with low Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) scores to minimize the risk of enamel wear and sensitivity. Look for toothpastes labeled as gentle or non-abrasive to ensure they won't harm your teeth or orthodontic appliances.

**Antibacterial Agents:** Braces create numerous areas where bacteria can thrive, increasing the risk of plaque buildup and gingivitis. Toothpastes containing antibacterial agents like stannous fluoride or cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) help to control bacterial growth and reduce inflammation. These ingredients prevent the formation of plaque and reduce the risk of gingivitis.Consistent use of these toothpastes helps maintain a healthy oral environment throughout orthodontic treatment.

**Calcium Phosphate Technology:** Some advanced toothpastes incorporate calcium phosphate technology,such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) or nano-hydroxyapatite. These ingredients help to repair and rebuild enamel by depositing calcium and phosphate ions onto the tooth surface. These materials can also help to fill in microscopic defects and improve the overall strength and appearance of teeth during orthodontic treatment. The advantage of this technology is it helps repair the effects around the areas where braces are attached.

**Sensitivity Relief:** Many individuals with braces experience increased tooth sensitivity due to pressure from the orthodontic appliances. Toothpastes formulated with ingredients like potassium nitrate can definitely help to reduce sensitivity by blocking nerve signals in the teeth. They offer comfort during and after brushing, allowing you to maintain consistent and effective oral care. Look for toothpastes with the ADA seal of Acceptance for sensitivity relief to ensure their effectiveness.**Stain Prevention:** braces can make your teeth more prone to staining, especially from foods and drinks like coffee, tea, and berries. Some toothpastes incorporate ingredients like hydrated silica or charcoal to help prevent and remove surface stains without being excessively abrasive. These toothpastes help maintain a brighter smile throughout treatment and reduce the risk of discoloration around the brackets.

## Core Benefits

Toothpaste for braces offers a multitude of benefits beyond basic oral hygiene,focusing on the specific challenges and requirements of orthodontic treatment.

**Enhanced Enamel Protection:** By utilizing toothpastes specifically designed for braces, individuals undergoing orthodontic treatment will experience enhanced enamel protection.Regularly using a toothpaste containing a high fluoride concentration prevents demineralization around the brackets and wires. This reduces the risk of white spot lesions, also known as decalcification, ensuring a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing outcome after braces are removed.

**Reduced Risk of Gingivitis:** Braces create numerous hard-to-reach areas where plaque and bacteria can accumulate, leading to gingivitis. Toothpastes formulated with antibacterial agents like stannous fluoride or CPC effectively combat bacterial growth and reduce inflammation. This minimizes the risk of gum disease and promotes healthier gums throughout orthodontic treatment, preventing discomfort and potential long-term complications.

**improved Cleaning around Brackets:** Standard toothpastes and brushing techniques often struggle to effectively clean around brackets and wires. Specialized toothpastes for braces often have a less foamy formula and are designed to work to clean in these areas and remove plaque.This results in a cleaner and healthier mouth, reducing the risk of cavities and gum disease.

**Relief from Tooth Sensitivity:** Many individuals with braces experience tooth sensitivity due to pressure and movement of teeth. Toothpastes with sensitivity-reducing ingredients like potassium nitrate can alleviate this discomfort.By blocking nerve signals, these toothpastes provide relief from sensitivity during and after brushing, allowing for consistent and comfortable oral care.

**Whiter and Brighter smile:** Braces can increase the risk of staining, especially around the brackets. Toothpastes with stain-fighting ingredients like hydrated silica or charcoal help to remove surface stains and prevent discoloration. This maintain a whiter and brighter smile throughout the treatment, boosting confidence and ensuring an attractive result once the braces are removed.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about toothpastes for braces can definitely help users make informed decisions. Understanding the specific requirements and benefits of these products is essential for effective oral care during orthodontic treatment.

**Can I use regular toothpaste with braces?**

While you can technically use regular toothpaste with braces, it's not recommended. Regular toothpastes may not provide the enhanced enamel protection, antibacterial properties, or low abrasiveness needed to effectively clean around brackets and protect against demineralization. Toothpastes specifically formulated for braces offer additional benefits, such as stain prevention and sensitivity relief, which are particularly important during orthodontic treatment. It's best to choose a toothpaste designed for braces to ensure optimal oral health.

**How frequently enough should I brush my teeth with braces?**

It's crucial to brush your teeth after every meal and before bed. Braces create many nooks and crannies where food particles and plaque can accumulate,increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease. Aim to brush at least three to four times a day for about two minutes each time. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and pay close attention to cleaning around the brackets, wires, and gumline. Supplementing brushing with interdental brushes and floss can further enhance plaque removal.

**What ingredients should I avoid in toothpaste when wearing braces?**

when choosing toothpaste for braces, it's best to avoid toothpastes with excessive abrasiveness, which can damage enamel. Ingredients to watch out for include baking soda, charcoal (in high concentrations), and whitening agents that rely on harsh abrasives. Also, avoid toothpastes with high levels of sugar or acidic ingredients. Look for toothpastes that are specifically formulated for braces, as they are designed to be gentle and effective for orthodontic appliances.

**How do I know if my toothpaste is ADA-approved?**

Toothpastes that have earned the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance have undergone rigorous testing to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Look for the ADA Seal on the packaging of your toothpaste. This seal indicates that the toothpaste contains fluoride, is safe for your teeth and gums, and has been proven to help prevent cavities. The ADA Seal is a reliable indicator of quality and can help you choose a toothpaste that meets the highest standards of oral care.

A few years ago, I saw a table which almost looked like it was burned. It was completely black, matte, and almost looked like bog oak. I’m trying to recreate that finish on my table. I can’t use fire, as I’m certain it would crack. What would be a good finish to get that effect? I’ve purchased some black milk paint, but I’m not sure if that is a durable finish. I’ve thought about dye, but I’ve had spotty results from wood dye in the past. I’ve used India ink, but that tends to leave a shiny finish, which I don’t want. I’ve thought about an iron acetate finish, but I’ve had mixed results depending on the species (I don’t know what kind of wood it is). What’s a good alternative?

1mmvbji,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mmvbji/im_an_underground_doctor_at_mr_js_workshop_part_2/,I’m An Underground Doctor at Mr. J’s Workshop part 2,"I’ve had a rough week. 

Coffee was once my best friend, but now he’s been set aside for my lover; cigarettes. Originally, I only smoked once or twice every few days. Just something to help me relax on breaks. Now packs that used to last me a week only last the weekend.

The past week has definitely shaved a few years off my life, but that seems to be an occupational hazard. Just instead of one week removing a year, it now removes two or three. 

Perhaps the nicotine flowing through my veins will deter some pesky late night patients. A small silver lining. I’ve been trying to appreciate them lately.

My troubles began on Monday morning. 

As I laid peacefully in bed - dreaming of finally discovering a mute button for Janet - I was awakened by an incessant buzzing. In a daze, I groaned, presuming it was my alarm announcing another day of work ahead of me. 

I waved my hand about in the dark aimlessly for a couple minutes, praying I’d find the source of the buzzing. While a light source would’ve been a much more effective search method, opening my curtains required movement. My bed was just too comfortable. 

Finally, with my phone in hand, I squinted at the screen. Since when was it so blurry?

I’d rather not admit how long it took me to remember I needed my glasses. I will admit however I’d fallen asleep with them on my head. I promptly pulled them down. 

While rubbing my eyes, I noticed the time read 4am. 

4am? I don’t need to be in until 6am. Did I set my alarm wrong? 

Somewhere in the back of my brain, my gears finally started to turn. My alarm didn’t sound like this. Wait a minute…

It was a phone call from one of our regulars. 

Still half-asleep, I yawned and picked up.  

“Hey Stacy, what’s up?” I smacked my lips a bit as I spoke. 

“It’s coming now, Dr. Morrigan! Right now!” 

A thick southern accent came from the other side. Despite the desperation in her voice, it didn’t register with me at the time. 

“Huh, what’s coming? Who?” 

“The baby!” 

“The wh-”

Everything then clicked for me. I could hear her pained breaths coming through the screen. I jumped out of bed, keeping the phone pressed to my ear with my shoulder. 

“Shit! Right, sorry Stacy!” 

I ran around my room picking up various shocks and underwear from my bedroom floor, trying to determine which were still clean enough to wear. A quick sniff sufficed.

“Shit. Dammit it. We don’t even have anything ready yet.”

I hopped around on one foot while trying to pull up my pants. Unintentionally attacking my furniture in the process. A chair there, a lamp over here, a painting on the ground there. I’m quite impressed by the damage I was capable of in the span of 30 seconds. 

“Oh come on.” I muttered. “Uh- Right. Stacy, head to the workshop. I’ll try to get a hold of Janet and Larry. I’m on my way right now!” 

My arm chair was now on its side.

“Ok Doctor, I-“

Stacy’s response was cut off by a laboured groan. As it came through, there was a sudden electrical spark from my phone. 

“Ow! Shit!” 

My phone was already on the floor before I even realised I dropped it. I shook my hand in pain. 

“Dammit, man. Stacy, are you still there?”

I reached for my phone, just to realise she’d already hung up. 

“Fucking of course, I-“ 

While turning to run out the door, my foot was suddenly met with the metallic pole of my lampshade that had found refuge on the floor from my rampage. I felt a hot surge of pain travel from my big toe up my leg.

“Ow! Fuck! Oh come on!”

I limped the rest of the way out of my apartment. 

Stacy was one of our regulars. Last I’d checked in on her, she was 34 weeks pregnant. It seems her baby was determined to enter the world however, unsurprising from the spawn of an eldritch horror. 

While premature births were fairly routine, there was one slight problem. 

Stacy is four stories tall. 

When providing her prenatal care in the past, we had to hide her under a large circus tent out back. While it wouldn’t have been impossible to fit her in the workshop, it would’ve been a tight squeeze. 

I was unsure of what to anticipate from this birth. While Stacy wasn’t the first Lovecraftian horror I had helped to bring offspring into the world, I had never been informed as to what kind of damage she could do. Or the baby. 

I had no idea what we’d signed up for. 

When I arrived, Stacy was already waiting outside under the tent. As I approached, I could see her clutch her stomach in pain. Each of her breaths were sharp. With each breath, I’d be pulled closer or pushed back by a small gust of wind she created. The warm air against my face made my skin crawl. 

“Stacy!” I called out to her. 

“Oh doctor, you are finally here!’’

Large, green and slimy, I’d never encountered a species like her before. Despite her feminine demeanor, I always couldn't help but gawk at her masculine body. She was built like a Greek statue. At the top of this body sat a large head, with tentacles for hair and a large beak. A peculiar yet mesmerising sight.

Even now I couldn’t help but marvel at the size of her. 

“Uh- can the father not make it?” I looked around, as if somehow I could miss another giant being hiding under a bright red and blue circus tent. 

“Oh, there is no father.” 

Now that I thought about it, she always came to her appointments alone. I tutted, what kind of scum would leave such a sweet lady to raise a baby alone? 

“Ah sorry to hear. He’s missing out on a beautiful moment.” I flipped through her medical file which I somehow remembered to bring with me. 

“Oh no, no, sorry. You misunderstood. There is no father.” 

This time she slightly nodded her head at me to emphasize each word. I began to catch on to what she was implying.  

“Oh.” 

It was too early for this shit, I don’t even want to know. 

While taking note of this divine intervention baby, I heard the slam of a car door behind me. To my relief, Larry had just exited his car and was now sprinting towards me. His barbels swung in the air behind him. 

Now that I think of it, Larry drives himself to work… how the fuck has he not been pulled over before? 

I set the thought to the side. Right, more important things going on right now Alice. 

“Larry! Quickly, open the shutters!”

Without hesitation, he gave me a thumbs up and pivoted his foot to change his direction towards the large red shutter door. It was once used for delivery trucks, now it was going to aid us in a new kind of delivery. 

While Larry got to work, a honda civic came skidding down the alleyway. In a flash, it went flying out of sight, followed by a;

SCREEEEECH!

And the sound of clattering metal. Janet emerged from around the corner, struggling to run in her red heels and pencil skirt. I turned away, pretending not to witness her tripping over a sleeping alley cat, and ignored the sound of it hissing behind me. 

“Janet, I need all the towels we’ve got!” 

She stopped in her tracks. I didn’t need to turn to see her eye roll, I could hear it from a mile away. I began to time Stacy’s contractions while hearing the workshop door be slammed shut in the distance. 

“Don’t worry Stacy, we are here now. We’ll get you sorted.” I said, still staring at my watch. 

“I know, Doctor.” She began between laboured breaths. “I’m in the best ha-“

Instead of finishing the sentence, she opted to scream in pain. 

For a moment, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me and tapped my legs to make them stop shaking. However, out of the corner of my eye I saw Larry moving up and down, struggling to stay on his feet and keep his grip on the shutter button.

Stacy screamed again, even louder. This time I could feel the movement under my feet, when I looked down I saw small pebbles bouncing in mid air. 

I heard someone approaching behind me.

“No, no, no!” 

I whipped around. Janet was struggling to balance the tower of towels she’d amassed. The pile could’ve reached the roof inside. I now wish I could've seen how she managed to get them through the door. 

As the tremors got more aggressive, the tower wobbled before collapsing completely. 

“Oh come on! Seriously?!” she protested as if her frustrations could change the course of events.

Janet watched helplessly as they all fell to the ground. Once Stacy’s screaming ceased, Janet scrambled to pick them up. 

“Janet, I need those inside!” 

“Oh fuck you Alice!” She flipped me off while still re-gathering her colourful assortment of towels. 

“I’m so sorry Doctor I-“ I could hear Stacy’s embarrassment and I was having none of it. 

“Just keep breathing Stacy! It’s fine!”

It was not fine. 

When the second round of the mini earthquake began, I could’ve sworn I saw something green sparkling at the bottom of the alleyway. I took my eyes off Janet’s struggles and to my surprise, I could see a rounded elongated sphere. Inside it there were glimpses of a reality like our own but warped. 

It disappeared when the earthquake stopped. 

Of course she can open portals to other dimensions. Why would my job ever be easy? 

To top it all off, I had to pray these on and off again earthquakes wouldn’t alert any local authorities. They were fairly common but not at this kind of frequency. Perhaps I could say the earthquake was just being a little shy and building itself up? Nothing to see here?

We were so fucked. 

It felt like a decade had gone by waiting for the shutter door to open. Once it finally was, I spared no time to express relief.  Instead I began pushing all of our ‘rooms’ to the side. Despite him not knowing the details of my plan, Larry began to copy me. 

“Stacy, try shuffling your lower half inside!” 

All our equipment was inside and it was a lot cleaner. There was also a highway not far from the factory and the tent was taller than it was long. I couldn’t risk anyone spotting her. This was the quickest solution I could think of without having to completely cramp her into the building. 

“R-right, I’ll try doctor.” 

Stacy began to slide inside, making sure to leave the tent over her head as she did. While she got into a comfortable position, I worked quickly to slide the ultrasound over to her. As I was about to place it on her stomach, I looked at the size of it then compared it to her. 

“Larry! Where’s our bigger ultrasound?!” 

Spinning on one foot, he scanned around the entire shop floor. After failing to spot anything, he shrugged. 

“Oh for fuck sak- Just grab the fetal monitor.” 

I wanted to make sure there were no complications with the baby coming so soon, I’d have to settle for monitoring the heart rate instead.

Like a loyal soldier, Larry obeyed my commands without delay and before I knew it what I had requested was beside me. We had a larger fetal monitor made for a past patient, so size was no issue this time. 

Larry climbed up to tape it along her stomach while I began to take notes of the baby’s heart rate. Everything appeared to be normal. Stacy’s contractions also appeared to be fine with no abnormalities. 

Perhaps this wouldn’t be too complicated after all.

“Do we have a blood cuff that will fit?” I asked Larry, who was kneeling over in front of me, exhausted by his mountaineering. 

With his two hands, he did a snapping branch motion. 

“Broken, really? Wait-  Yeah, you’re right I was meant to ask Mr J. for a new one. How are we going to keep track of her blood pressure then?”

Stacy began to scream again.

“I have a suspicion it's high!”

The building began to tremble. One by one, the lights on the roof began to come crashing down, causing electrical sparks as they did. 

A single spark managed to reach one of the curtains setting it alight. Desperate, I tried to search for something to put it out. The coupling gel for the ultrasound? Bad idea. A chair? That makes no sense. My foot? That could work. 

Before I had even settled on my method, Larry was already over frantically jumping up and down on the flame. While at first I was going to thank him, I then watched him drop to the floor and start rolling over it, his body vibrating from the tremors as he did. 

“No. Larry, stop, drop and roll, is for when *you're* on fire!” 

Fortunately, the flame had already been extinguished by his initial stomps. I judged him a little as he struggled to rise to his feet. 

For a surgeon, he's always quick to panic…

Outside the shutter door, something caught my eye. Another green portal appeared, consuming Stacy’s tent before evaporating with her screams. When I turned back to look at Larry, I realised he was looking right back at me, both attempting to confirm we weren’t going crazy. 

I couldn’t focus on any of my thoughts over Stacy’s loud breathing. That’s when I remembered it was Stacy I should be focusing on. 

I gestured to Larry to go to the storage closet. 

“Get some Diamorphine, also grab a mattress to give the baby something to land on.” 

He nodded and ran off. 

“Diamorphine? Isn’t that a pain killer doctor?” Stacy bellowed down to me. 

“Well… yeah?” I replied, I knew what she was about to say next. 

“Thank you doctor, but I don’t want it! I want it to be an all natural birth!” 

Fuck. 

Under normal circumstances, I’d say to each their own. But at this rate the building was going to collapse in on us. 

“Are you sure?! No pain killers at all?!”

“I’m sure!”

“Not even a TENS machine?”

“Woo, woo, no! I- I don’t want anything like that doctor!”

“Oh I think you do.”

“I uh- I don’t?”

“Well I think I want you to think you do.“

“Why? Is it a medically necessary doctor?”

“I mean… no but-“ 

“Then I’ll pass. Our ancestors did it for generations without pain killers. I'm sure I’ll manage!”

“Dammit, Stacy, you’re going to get us all killed!” 

I heard my voice echo throughout the workshop floor. There was a beat of silence. 

“Oh… I’m sorry doctor, I thought you said it was fine…” I couldn’t see her face but I could feel her disappointment. 

“Uh- I mean- Yeah! Everything's fine… I just meant you were uh- You’re going to kill us emotionally! Watching you in pain like this!” My voice cracked a few times as I internally screamed; ‘ALICE, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?’

“Aw, thank you so much for the concern doctor! I’ll be just fine.” I could hear her smile from all the way down at her feet. Even while in pain she smiled so brightly. 

I hope my expression was less obvious from my voice. I could feel my eyes about to pop out of my skull, staring at the ground in disbelief at my choices. I had chosen suicide over social suicide. What a bargain. 

Damn Stacy, she’s too sweet even for my heart. 

I refocused on the task at hand to distract me from my past decisions. Larry could be informed when he returned. Stacy was now 10 metres dilated, ready to start pushing. Before I could give this direction however, I encountered a problem. 

Have you ever seen those videos where people crush watermelons with their thighs? Yeah, this was a much less sexy version of that. 

The baby’s head was starting to become visible, but while her cervix was a wide enough canal for the baby to fit through, I noticed Stacy’s thighs were putting too much pressure on it. I heard the odd crack, which I could only presume was its skull. 

I looked up at Stacy’s legs, they were far too close together. A consequence of being cramped inside. 

“Stacy, I need you to spread your legs wider!” 

She didn’t respond, too focused on the pain. Despite this, she followed my directive. To my dismay however, her legs couldn’t spread much further, now touching the walls with her knees. This hadn’t resolved the problem. 

Dammit, what do I do? I could maybe flip her around, have her bottom half outside. But she was huge, turning wasn't going to be easy. 

Now with the clock clicking closer to 5am, the highway was likely to start gaining some early birds. With the tent gone, her standing up outside would be a real risk. 

As I was attempting to come up with some plan, I realised Janet was inching closer, laying out her towels which now stretched from the shutter to Stacy’s hip. 

I tried to ignore her, but immediately became distracted as I saw her smudge her lipstick and stop everything to fix it. She set the remaining towels to the side and pulled out a stick to fix her mistake.

“Does this really seem like the time Janet?!” 

“You focus on your job, I’ll focus on mine.” 

“That’s my problem! Stopping being a vain cow and get back to work!”

“Excuse me?!”

Suddenly, Janet’s heels weren’t an issue anymore as she rapidly approached me. I stood firm, ready to face her. But before it went any further, Larry had returned and put up his hands, getting between us. 

I was so distracted by our back and forth, I hadn’t noticed Larry had already retrieved a mattress and laid it in front of Stacy’s legs. 

I began to gesture for Larry to follow me.

“Right, right, you’re right Larry. Sorry. We also have a problem I-“ 

“No, we aren’t done here. You need to learn you are not my boss!”

I turned, ready to tell Janet to kindly fuck off, but was instead surprised to see her turn deathly pale. I followed her line of gaze, and realised she saw what was between Stacy’s legs. She promptly fainted. 

“Oh for the love of- Larry, make sure she didn’t hit her head too badly.”

Larry’s head flopped about in a manic state, from me to Janet, to Stacy, then back to me. I grabbed him by the shoulders and began shaking him. 

“Hey, hey! It’s just you and me now. We’ve got this. It’s just one baby, how bad can it be?” 

If he could still sweat, Larry would’ve flooded us. I then saw a light behind his eyes, a momentary hope. Proudly, he raised the diamorphine he’d retrieved on his mission. 

My expression must’ve given it away, as I watched that light slowly flicker out. As I relayed the news to him, his hands dropped to his side in dismay. In the process, he almost dropped the pain killers but I quickly snatched them. 

For a moment, I considered using them on myself, then set them to the side. 

I then looked Larry in the eye and shook his hand. 

“No matter what happens Larry, it was a pleasure working with you.” 

With his spare hand, he gave me a small salute. 

“Now, then. I’ve encountered a problem.” I gestured to the baby struggling to crown, “But I think I have a solution.”

This wasn’t the most conventional plan, but this also wasn’t the most conventional birth. 

While the walls of the workshop were getting in Stacy’s way, the windows wouldn’t. 

To allow a little extra light onto the shop floor, there were small windows outlining where the walls met the ceiling. All we had to do was help Stacy get her legs through there. They’d only allow for apart of her knees to slightly poke out, but I hoped it would be enough.

With some of the windows now smashed, Larry managed to secure his ladder for the remaining ones on the left. Ascending to the top, he prepared his trusty hammer. Once at the top of the ladder however, he struggled to stay balanced, having to give up his smashing companion to avoid falling himself. 

When I saw the hammer hit the floor, I sprinted towards it. Before I reached it, I noticed Larry moving above. He stretched out his hand, indicating for me to stop. 

I didn’t have time to question him, as he was already winding up his elbow. 

In one swift motion he smashed through a window pane. Then another. And another. Shards plummeting to the floor. 

I had no time to protest his methods. 

“Stacy honey, do me a favour again and raise your legs up to the sky.” 

Without question, probably too disoriented to pry, she raised them up. 

“Good, good, now just follow my directions ok? Stretch them out a bit further. Slowly.” 

Again she followed my orders. Even despite the circumstances, Stacy was always an angel.

I paid close attention to her knees, making sure they were going where they needed to be. Her left knee edged closer and closer to Larry, while the other mimicked the motion on her other side. 

“Ok, Stacy, good job so far. When you feel Larry tap your knee, stop.” 

I think I felt her nod, as dust came loose from the ceiling. 

Larry tapped her knee repeatedly, stopping her right in front of his face. 

“Great! Now he’ll direct you up, do the same motion with the other knee.” 

The key was to not scratch Stacy’s knees in the process. The last we needed was a glass shard impaling her. Especially with Larry’s current location, another earthquake could spell his doom.

Gently, Larry guided her leg up above his head. Larry was doing no heavy lifting himself, instead he was just gliding her where she needed to be. 

I held my breath as she made it to the glass panes. I didn’t take my eyes off her boney leg as it traversed its way through the broken shards. Then she stopped. 

They were both through. 

I released my breath, then went back to focusing on the baby. 

My heart dropped when I realised after all that effort, it still wasn’t enough room. 

I was out of ideas. 

Stacy trusted me with this baby. It was my call to bring her inside. Just for half the equipment to be useless and now the lack of space was threatening her infant's life. 

Maybe I could get her to crawl back out? It’d be hard with the state she was in. It was clear that just lifting her knees was a lot of effort for her and the movement may just crush the baby further. Could we somehow bulldoze the walls? There was no time. Dammit.

 I may have just killed her baby. 

My mind raced for a solution. The ground slightly vibrated as she groaned. I saw another flicker of green in the distance. I then had a dumb idea. 

“Hey Stacy, next time you make one of those portals, can you try direct it inside of you?!” 

I could feel Larry’s gaze from the top of the ladder. I averted my eyes, I didn’t need to see his expression to know he thought I was crazy. 

“U-um,I guess I can t-try Doctor!” 

Stacy, a doll as always. 

I could hear the metal clanks of Larry descending the ladder in the distance. I waited, bracing myself for another earthquake. It needed to happen soon, not only for the baby but so Larry couldn’t reach me on time to question me.

It wasn’t long before she wailed again. 

Stacy’s scream alone was enough to make the workshop shake. This was followed by a much larger tremor. I could hear Larry struggling to stay on his ladder, but I was preoccupied. My eyes darted around, waiting for a portal to appear. But it never did. 

Maybe that meant… 

Before I could finish my thought all hell broke loose. 

A black hole opened between Stacy’s legs. With it came a large gust of wind pushing me back. I heard a sharp zipping sound fly by, I looked behind me to see our incision tools from a table nearby, now in the wall. 

“Holy shit!” 

There was no time to think about my close call with death, as the black hole expanded. It began to pull us towards it. 

I grabbed a metal support beam as Larry went flying off his ladder towards the roof. With no other options, he managed to get hold of one of the lights. It was barely hanging on, with only a couple cables now more akin to strings keeping it attached to the roof. 

The entire shop floor erupted into chaos. Papers were blown around scattering in the air. Surgical tables and x-ray machines inched towards the portal, scraping along the ground. The scalpels from before shook violently, becoming looser and looser from the walls. 

Even outside, dirt and debris began to form dust clouds that rapidly swirled towards the portal. Even some pigeons who were attempting to fly by were now being forced inside, struggling to flap against its powerful pull. 

It doubled in size again. 

More went zooming through the air. Beds, curtains, leftover coffee mugs, Janet. Oh shit we forgot about Janet! 

The realisation hit me when I saw Janet begin to lift off the ground. I reached out, grabbing her forearm. I wished there was time to be relieved, but now I had to hold on for dear life with one hand. 

When I looked up, the light that was meant to be Larry’s saving grace was becoming looser. The small threads one by one began to unravel, snapping each time they completely whittled down. 

Larry looked down at me with desperation. 

“Just hold on Larry!” 

I didn’t need to remind him. 

My grip was becoming weaker and weaker. In other circumstances perhaps I would’ve begun to pray, but all the chaos made it hard to think. 

As I stared at the portal, anticipating my doom, something began to emerge. 

I heard the cries of a child. 

I tried to focus in to confirm my suspicions, but suddenly everything from the portal shot back out with a powerful force. Larry plummeted to the floor, managing to direct his body toward the mattress. 

Not as fortunate, I went blasting through the air. I cradled Janet in an attempt to take the main force of the blow. The impact of my back hitting the wall sent a sharp pain all the way up my spine. 

The pain blurred my vision momentarily. I didn’t think I broke anything but I couldn’t be sure. That’s when I began to regain my focus. 

In front of me, sharing the same mattress as Larry, was a green baby with tentacles, flailing its limbs. 

“She actually did it…” I couldn’t help but say aloud.

The infant bore a striking resemblance to its mother. While small in comparison, it was still the size of an SUV. As it cried, I could feel small tremors under my feet. Now looking at the size of its large cranium, I suspected we’d have encountered the same issues even if outside. 

The tentacles of its hair reached out attempting to grab everything around it, swiping Larry off the mattress in the process. He lay face down on the floor. 

The black hole had long since been closed. Everything for a moment laid still. 

Stacy reached down with one hand for her baby. Cradling it in her arms, she rocked it side to side struggling to look down at it in the cramped space.

“There you are my sweet little angel…” she gushed over her infant. 

The baby softly cooed as it reached out to her. Stretching out her hand, she let it grab one of her fingers. Its hands were so tiny compared to hers. 

I felt a smile begin to creep up in my face. Was this what motherhood looked like? 

This sweet moment was promptly cut off as fear struck me. Another portal had opened up behind Stacy.

“Oh not again!” I braced myself. 

To my surprise, everything continued to lay where it was. Unsure of what I’d find, I raised my head to glance back in their direction. 

Stacy flipped her large body around and began to crawl toward the interdimensional portal. On the other side of it, I could see thousands of intricate solar systems. Fantastic pinks, purples and blues lit up the shop floor. 

“Thank you for all the help doctor!” With each of her movements the walls began to quake. 

“Wait! Stacy, I need to-!” 

Right before she entered the portal, she took her newborn in one hand and brought it to her beak. In a blink of an eye, she swallowed it whole.

I sat dumbfounded. 

There was no crunch, no gulp, not even a squelch as it slid down her throat. Only a loud burp from Stacy, followed by a quick apology excusing herself. 

“…need to.. examine the baby…” The sentiment felt pointless now.

“See you again in 9 months!” She sang. 

I watched, contemplating my life, as she crawled out of view. Once she was out of sight, the portal vanished. 

The pigeons cooed, strutting and pecking at the ground. Chairs, equipment and curtains were a jumbled mess across the floor. Some paper had made it outside the shutter door from the blast. The outdoors also made it indoors, as dirt covered the entire floor. Some of it landed on Janet’s towels so there was a small win.

I looked around me. Analysing the aftermath of a seemingly pointless endeavour, wondering if it could get any worse. 

As if on cue, I began to feel Janet squirm about. When I lowered my head I met her gaze. I could tell she wasn’t fully awake yet by how she squinted her eyes. 

She had been utterly useless throughout this whole process. Maybe that’s why she was reserved to just being a receptionist. 

I witnessed the slow realisation dawn in her eyes that I was holding her. Without missing a beat, she jumped to her feet, disgusted. 

“What on earth do you think you are doing?!” She screeched, causing my ears to ring. 

It must’ve been a rhetorical question as she gave me no time to answer. After quickly dusting herself off, she stomped away. I listened as her heels clicked further into the distance. 

“… Yeah Janet, I’m fine… oh yes of course no need to thank me… no, no, don’t bother yourself with cleaning up, I’ll get it sorted.” 

My humour brought me no comfort. I couldn’t help but let out a sigh. 

Tired, I looked over to Larry, still face down on the floor. 

“You good Larry?” 

He responded with a thumbs up, before letting his hand flop back down by his side. 

“Good, good…” 

I sat in the silence of a now confused workshop. 

The door creaked open across from me. A client poked his head inside. Even from a distance I could see his eyes were bloodshot. Clearly he was on something. Every so often he twitched as he stepped inside. 

As he bore witness to the chaos that laid before him, his eyes widened to take it all in. 

“Uh… is this the workshop?” He asked. 

I lit a cigarette. 

For the rest of the day, Janet looked at me like I committed some horrific crime against her bloodline. If she wants to die so badly, next time I’ll just let her. 

I ignored her glares while me and Larry attempted to restore the workshop back to its former glory. While the black hole returned our belongings, most were damaged beyond recognition. 

The light fixtures needed to be replaced. Our ladders were too short to reach so I sent Janet on an errand. She returned with a shorter ladder to add atop our current one. I couldn’t tell if she was being intentionally dense or not.

Mr. J. had to send us a lot of replacement curtains. The poles were all bent out of shape from the force of the final impact. Got some which were a tint more green than they were blue. I’m sure patients will definitely notice and care for the redecorating. 

When I got home that night I received another phone call from Stacy.

“Hey doctor!” 

“Stacy? Is there something wrong?” 

“No, no, I just wanted to schedule my next appointment.”

“Appointment? For what? You ate-“ 

I stopped the sentence from leaving my mouth. Maybe that was culturally insensitive. 

“It’s for my next prenatal check up!” 

“…excuse m?-”

It hit me. She did say she’d be back…

I said nothing. Holding the phone away from my ear, I just stared right ahead of me. Despite my silence she continued talking away, muffled in the background.

“Sorry I thought you had done this before doctor I…”

Whatever her explanation was, it faded out under my internal scream for salvation. I took another cigarette and lit it, tossing the lighter across the room. 

“Uh.. doctor? Hello..? You still there? …. Doctor?” 

I hung up. 

Via text, I told Stacy there was a connection issue and I’d organise our next appointment in the morning. Once she confirmed, ignorant to my poor excuse, I slumped into bed. 

I spend many nights before bed staring at my roof. Something most people do I’m sure. But have you ever gotten really familiar with your ceiling? To the point it’s the only comfort you know day to day?

It becomes the only common thread in your life. The only thing you can rely on being normal. It may change from time to time - with paint and dust - but at least it’s always there. Waiting for you to come home.

I lit one more cigarette. 

I dreaded the week ahead of me. I had no idea, it was only going to get worse.

## Key⁤ Features Analysis

The best accent tables of 2025 should possess a harmonious‌ blend ⁢of style, functionality, and durability. Factors such as material quality, design versatility, and ease of assembly play a crucial role in determining their overall value. The following features are essential to consider when selecting an ⁣accent table.

**Material Durability:** The choice of materials significantly impacts the longevity and ⁤aesthetic appeal of an accent table.Look for ‍tables crafted from solid wood,such as oak or maple,known for their sturdiness ⁢and resistance‌ to wear and tear. Metal frames, ‍especially those ‍made from powder-coated steel or aluminum, offer ‍robust support and a contemporary look. Glass tabletops, while visually appealing, should be tempered ‌for safety and resistance to breakage. The quality of the materials ensures that the table can withstand⁢ daily use and maintain its appearance over time.

**Design Versatility:** An​ ideal accent table should ‍seamlessly integrate into various interior design styles.

Consider tables with minimalist designs that can​ complement both modern and traditional decor. Tables with neutral color palettes, such as whites, grays, ⁤and natural wood ⁣tones, provide flexibility in matching existing ⁢furniture and ⁣color schemes. Geometric shapes and ​sculptural designs can add a touch of artistic flair to ⁤a room, while tables with storage options, such as drawers or shelves, offer added functionality.

**Size and Proportions:** The dimensions of an accent table are critical ‍for ensuring it fits appropriately within a given ​space.

Measure the area where the table will be⁣ placed to determine the ideal height, width, and depth. Accent tables should be proportional to the surrounding furniture; a table that is too large can overwhelm a space, while one that is too small can appear‌ insignificant.​ Standard heights for accent tables range from‌ 24 to 30 inches,‍ making ‌them ​suitable for use alongside sofas or armchairs.

**Ease of Assembly:** ​A user-friendly assembly process is essential for a ​positive consumer ‌experience.

opt for ⁢tables that come with⁢ clear and concise instructions, along with all necessary hardware.‌ Tables with pre-assembled components or minimal assembly requirements can save time and⁣ effort. Check ⁤customer reviews for feedback on the⁢ assembly process ⁤before making a purchase.‍ A straightforward assembly ensures that you can quickly and easily set up your new⁣ accent table.

Key features of the best accent tables include:

*   Durable construction

I’m so frustrated with this entire situation and I’m done with them. I think it’s time to completely move on from our friendship but We were friends since kindergarten.

First off my mom passed form breast cancer, in February which would have been her 50th I got depressed. And I for some reason couldn’t get past it; I don’t have a history of mental issues or severe depression.

Then In march 2025 I got sick, mostly mentally. I was very clearly not okay, in and out of the hospital. My hormones were such a mess a was genuinely close to the point of being mentally insane.

It was bad but it got worse, I got treated with birth control and had a bad reaction multiple times causing migraines, nausea, even fainting. I did attempt s*icide during this time, I was not myself. I know I have to take responsibility and they don’t owe it to me to support me when I’m suffering like that. I also around the same time had some success in my acting career, so they actually told another friend that I was isolating because I was “too good for them” meanwhile I wanted to die

Neither of these friends reached out. They knew it was bad. I asked them to get dinner one night when I was feeling good and neither could.

Halfway through march I met this guy, yes he’s 51 and there’s an age gap however he was nice to me when everyone else was treating me like garbage. Everyone was assuming on my post he creeped on me somehow.. he saw me walking at 11pm all alone crying and ran over to make sure I was okay. I had never met him and he took me home that night.

He had no way of knowing everything else, he asked for my number and suggested we grab a coffee since I told him I needed someone to talk to.


It took months for me to get better. Meds made me worse, every birth control made me more and more erratic, depressed, angry and sick. 

We had known each other for like a month and he was already checking on me daily, even brought his computer to the hospital and watched movies with me. 

Now I’m doing pretty well, and I’m on vacation with him. Did a hard launch on instagram lol

All of the sudden my friends are asking about him, I told them the story and was excited they reached out

All of the sudden they’re saying he took advantage of me, and they have never even met him. They also talked about my relationship behind my back.. 

I can’t figure out if they even have any good intentions or if they’re just trying to hurt me?

Which by the way he surprised me with this vacation, after I told him one time it was my dream destination… and my friends who couldn’t even answer my texts are criticizing him

1mmv49r,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1mmv49r/the_lies_we_tell_ourselves/,The Lies We Tell Ourselves,"Hey guys,


I’ve learned a lot of lessons since I started this business 2 months ago, and I’ve come to a lot of realizations that some of you may relate to, or could benefit from hearing. There are so many practices in our industry that are preached about ad nauseum, and are so ingrained in our culture that no one dares to question them. The reality is, a lot of our standards are built on sleazy sales tactics or ego-driven justifications, and have nothing to do with providing a good service. These are some of the common “truths” we hear about that actually have no ethical or philosophical basis: 

1.) “High Ticket Sales” Omg if I have one more person try to explain this to me as a legitimate business model. Charging people as much money as possible up front is not a new idea, it’s just a repackaging of the classic “how much do you spend on coffee” timeshare strategy. No matter how you justify it, the only ethical way to price your services is to maximize the value *you* provide based on the cost to *you*. As soon as you bring your clients perception of that value in to the mix, you are setting the stage for manipulation. Honest work, honest pay. If you want to prioritize making money over being accessible to your clients longterm, I seriously don’t take issue with that. I just hate all the circle jerking I see where trainers reassure eachother that they’re worth every penny that a client is willing to pay.


2.) S.M.A.R.T goals are dumb. 
I’m not sure if NASM was the OG of this, but it’s been around forever. I expect to get a lot of blowback about this, since I haven’t heard anyone else broach the topic. Setting a goal on day 1 with your client has *nothing* to do with getting them results. It doesn’t give you any information relevant to programming/communication that you wouldn’t have through a normal conversation. 

And it’s completely illogical. You’re taking someone with no fitness experience, asking them to imagine their future selves, and then having them commit to a routine that will get them there, when they have no concept of what their routine even is, or what challenges they will face. 

It’s not an effective motivator either. First of all, you’re in the first session with them. They didn’t come to you in the middle of a dark depressive episode. They are already in a period of high motivation. And you should be nurturing that and helping it grow naturally. Building it up to an arbitrary image in their mind isn’t nurturing that motivation, it’s distorting it. Now your client who may have been focused on putting one foot in front of the other is instead thinking about 12 weeks from now and if the image you implanted is real.

When you take a closer look, it’s clear this is just simple emotional manipulation, another clsssic timeshare tactic. You key in to their insecurities, you build an imagine in their mind of a happier version of themselves, and then you set a strict timeline of events so that you have ammo for your re-up if it goes well, and deniability of fault if it doesn’t. Which brings me to another favorite:

3.) You aren’t holding people accountable, you’re just lacking accountability.

This one always makes me laugh. “Holding your client accountable” is something that’s used as if it’s just a given as a role for trainers. And I can see how the lie was born:

As mentioned above, you set that goal with your client as a roadmap to the re-sign. But what if your client doesn’t do their part? Luckily, you already set expectations day 1. So as long as you texted them every week asking why they didn’t come in, you did your part. Any lack of results is purely on them, right?

And the crazy part is clients will not only agree with you, they’ll bring it up day 1! “I wanted to sign up with a trainer because I need accountability” so obviously it’s a key part of our role, right?

First of all, holding someone accountable is literally a nonsensical statement. It only has meaning in a courtroom, where there exists an accepted authority on morality or however you want to define what our laws are supposed to reflect. Being held accountable is being punished by a party whose soul purpose is to serve justice, and has no direct involvement. If you’re  pushing someone to take accountability, then it is no longer accountability. 

So when you tell your client “hey you’ve been missing sessions and coming in late so you’re not gonna reach your goals in time like we planned out”, that’s just you denying accountability and putting blame on them. There’s no world where you teach someone a behavior by doing the opposite of that behavior to them. You’re purely doing both yourself and them a disservice, when you should be examining how your program could have done a better job at promoting compliance. 

And lastly, your clients aren’t looking up to you as experts on discipline. When they say they need a trainer for accountability, all they mean is that they will be more likely to not quit because of the money and time commitment. Most people who can afford personal training are successful. They’re business owners, CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and have busy schedules, a family to feed, etc. they are not going to be inspired  by the part-time trainer who’s in the gym 5 days a week surrounded by protein supplements and gets to spend all of Sunday meal prep. Your clients actually will often be more disciplined than you, and that’s fine. Your job is to make their fitness journey feel easy, not to pretend like you’re some hardened marine with the secrets to leveling up your mindset.

If you want to teach accountability take accountability. 


The underlying theme here is that there is an ego-epidemic among trainers. We are already by default more prone to narcissistic traits due to the roles of the job. Add in a few “you’re the best trainer ever” from clients who don’t know shit about training, some big months in revenue as we perfect our manipulation tactics, and a culture of bullshit we all feed ourselves and eachother, and it comes together in one giant ego-storm that will ultimately crumble our value to society.

Well that’s all I have. I know many of you will disagree with everything I wrote here, but that’s exactly what I’d expect because of everything I outlined above. I just haven’t had the oppurtunity to have real conversations about this with enough trainers, and I’m hoping these ideas will resonate with some of you and lead to a bigger discussion. 

That being said, I’m preparing for an onslaught. I just want you all to know, I don’t mean any of these criticisms to be point at you. Its a systemic problem that indoctrinates all of us, including me for a long time. I’m just stuck on these ideas and I feel so strongly that there needs to be a positive movement to bring more ethics to our field.

So on that note, I just ask that you refrain from personal attacks in your responses, and I will do the same. I’m not closed off to having my opinion changed, and if you are just realize that by participating in the discussion you are ultimately shutting down the possibility of it being productive. So, who’s got some strong opinions?

So, I have a big, open concept kitchen/tv room/front foyer and currently I have the same colour/pattern on my kitchen runner, back door rug, and front door rug. I would like to put an area rug under my couch and coffee table and I'm wondering if it would be weird to get the same rug - again - just larger. 

I flip flop between 'it would be too... confrontational (??) to have a new colour and/or pattern' and the thought that I'm being incredibly lame and uncreative buying the same rug again. 

I've included pics - please excuse my mess -  I have kids who have been home all weekend.

But, heres what finally helped.","I’m not new to thyroid issues - I’ve been on medication for a while, and it did help. But even with meds, something still felt off.

I could sleep 9 hours and wake up feeling like I hadn’t slept at all. My face stayed puffy, my brain felt like it was wrapped in cotton, and my moods were all over the place. Every doctor visit ended the same way: “Your labs look fine.”

Fine… but I didn’t feel fine.

I’m kind of a nerd when it comes to research - give me a reason, and I’ll spend hours going down rabbit holes. And now, I had a reason. The people who were supposed to be helping me weren’t offering much beyond “everything looks normal,” so I decided to help myself.

I started reading every article, every study I could find (I'll leave a few in the comments section). Over and over, I kept seeing hints about a link between vitamin A, iodine, and thyroid function. I’d never heard this from a single doctor before. It wasn’t framed as a miracle cure - just a possible missing piece for people like me.

When I mentioned this to my functional medicine NP, she didn’t roll her eyes or brush it off like others had. She actually listened. Then she did something no one else had done: she helped me build on my research. Together, we created a schedule to support both vitamin A and iodine, alongside the meds I was already taking.

We kept it simple. At first, I tried adding more seaweed and liver to my diet to get both nutrients naturally. It worked for a while, but doing that every single day got… well, unrealistic. We moved to supplements next, but honestly? A handful of pills and Lugol’s iodine every day just wasn’t for me. Then I came across a simple spray version with both in one - way easier to stick to daily without overthinking it. I made a few other changes - swapped seed oils for whole eggs, avocado, and grass-fed meat… waited an hour before coffee… got 10 minutes of morning sunlight… kept a symptom journal.

It wasn’t instant. But over the next 90 days, mornings stopped feeling like quicksand. My brain fog lifted. My energy came back - not all at once, but enough to feel like “me” again. My cycle even regulated for the first time in years.

If you’ve been told you’re “fine” but know something’s wrong - you’re not crazy. Sometimes you just need the right missing piece… and someone willing to help you find it.",1,1754862290.0,u_No_Definition_8887,1,1.0,False

1mmv27l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mmv27l/strange_neighbors/,Strange Neighbors,"They seemed like a regular family, at first glance at least. We lived in a neighborhood that was like any other modern suburbia, it was a nice area, the kind where you'd feel comfortable leaving your door unlocked at night. I did grow up quite comfortably, not to brag, but that's not to say things were perfect. It especially took a turn when they moved in. I was twelve years old and excited when I found out that the new neighbors had a kid my age, a girl. 

I had been homeschooled for a few years, because my school life in our old neighborhood was absolute hell. I was a bit of an oddball, I didn't have many things in common with the students there, not to mention I was going through an alt phase, and, well, you know how it goes. When they realize you're different from them, you may as well throw in the towel and start over again. I was bullied harder than you can imagine, and no matter how many times my parents pressured the school to do something, the most they could offer was mandatory anti-bullying seminars. Someone would come into each classroom in intervals and lecture us saying “treat others how you want to be treated” and “if you see someone sitting alone offer them to sit with you.” Yeah, a whole lot of good that did. 

But instead of transferring me to another school, they decided to have me homeschooled through a tutor that would visit me in person, or help me over a computer video call if she or I happened to be sick that week. Mom and dad just didn't trust the school system anymore, and honestly, I couldn't blame them. While I was relieved to not have to endure the torment of my peers daily, I soon started to realize how isolating this new arrangement was. There weren't a lot of kids my age around there,  y'know? They were either too young, like kindergarteners, or too old, like snobby teens about to leave for college. All I wanted was to have friends. Or a friend. Be careful what you wish for, I guess.

I remember the day their van pulled into their driveway. I was sitting on the porch swing enjoying a bomb pop, and I immediately took interest as they all got out of the car in unison and walked into the house that'd been vacant since we moved there. They strode in single file, first the dad (who quite literally was a blue collar worker it seemed, as he had a bright blue button up shirt), then the mom, who seemed pretty but dressed sort of old fashioned, and lastly their daughter, who skipped along after them like a kid from some corny cartoon. Her blonde hair swished around and I saw her blue eyes twinkle as we briefly made eye contact before she disappeared into their new home. 

It was weird, but I liked weird. I didn't even think about the fact they didn't show up with a moving truck, or didn't seem to move any items or belongings into the house before they just came out of nowhere. I mean, I was certain they'd only just moved in, because I noticed the For Sale sign was gone that very morning, and when I asked my parents, they said no one had come by the previous days. After I brought it up to them, my very nosey mother even called the other neighbors about it to be absolutely sure. This was definitely the first day they'd been there. 

It might sound like I'm making a big deal out of it, but we never actually saw a moving truck in the following days either. We never even saw them unloading boxes from their van. They simply showed up, got out, and went right inside.  

“Maybe the home was already furnished.” I remember Dad saying at the dinner table one night that week, not finding this as odd or interesting as mom and I did. 

“These homes don't come already furnished, Todd.” My mom rolled her eyes. “And even then, you don't just bring furniture when you move, what about your luggage? Clothes, that sort of thing?” 

“They could've done it late at night when everyone was asleep.” Dad shrugged, dabbing his mouth with a napkin. “Who knows?” 

“They have a girl my age,” I'd said with excitement, “Do you think she might like some things I like?”

“Like comic books and bugs?” My mom scoffed. “It's more likely she's into Barbie dolls or fashion mags, babes. But we'll see soon, I suppose. I plan on taking them a gift basket this weekend and inviting them to dinner.” 

I was so eager to meet their daughter, that I accompanied mom the afternoon she brought the basket over. It contained fragrant flowers, exquisite chocolates, and colorful fruit kabobs, the best of the best. I tried to hide my big grin as she rang the doorbell and we waited on the doorstep. I needed to act cool or I might scare her away. 

The door opened so fast, it actually startled both me and mom. Mom's finger had barely left the button, and the bell didn't have time to complete its little chime. We were met with the face of who I would come to know as Mrs. Smith, her eyes big and cheery and her curved lips smeared with bright red lipstick. The way she applied lipstick was like a seven year old coloring just a bit over the lines in their coloring book, you could tell she had no idea what she was doing with her makeup in general. She wore her blonde hair in a bob and was dressed in some sleeveless, collared, floral-printed pink dress, as if she'd stepped out of a time machine from the 60’s or something. 

“Hi! I'm Renee and this is my daughter, Ellen. We brought this for you to welcome you into the neighborhood.” Mom handed her the basket. 

“Oh this smells wonderful, I think I'll use it as a centerpiece for my table.” Something about the way Mrs. Smith talked was off. It sounded so stilted, like she had memorized a script. 

“We wanted to invite you and your family over for dinner tonight. It's a bit short notice, but do you think you could make it?” Mom asked. 

“Oh, that would be wonderful!” Mrs. Smith replied in an attempt at an overjoyed tone of voice. “I'm going to tell my husband Charles Smith and my daughter, Sally Smith. My name is Sarah Smith, by the way. We are the Smiths.” 

Take a shot every time she says ‘Smith,’ I wanted to mutter to my mom, but I didn't get the chance before she answered. She smiled and offered her hand to Mrs. Smith  without a beat, “So you are! Nice to meet you all.” 

Mrs. Smith shook her hand and stepped to the side. “Would you both like to come in for some ice cold lemonade?” 

“No, thank you. But please, come over to our place next door at about six PM sharp, dinner will be done just in time. You may dress casually, if you'd like. That dress looks stunning, by the way.” 

“Oh, this old thing? I just threw this on!” Mrs. Smith's smile barely faltered this entire time. It stayed just as big, without waning or changing shape in any way. It started to weird me out. Who could keep such a big smile on for that long? “We will be at your house at 6, Renee Forrester!” 

We said our goodbyes and the shit talking began immediately as we walked back over to our house. 

“It certainly looks like she just threw it on.” My mom said, eliciting a snicker out of me. 

“What a creepy smile.” I said, hoping she would agree. 

“Don't be ridiculous, it wasn't creepy, it was just silly looking, there's a difference. It was fake. She's trying to seem nice but she probably isn't.” Mom said as we stepped back into the house. “Hopefully she doesn't wear that old thing tonight.” 

I realized something and blinked. “Hey mom, when did you tell her our last name?” 

“Hm?” Mom looked at me curiously. 

“She said ‘be at your house at 6, Renee Forrester’! Remember?” 

“Oh, did she?” Mom frowned. “Must've said our last names when I introduced us, then.” 

“Um, no, you didn't.” I crossed my arms, growing irritated. “You just said our first names. Isn't this the first time they've met us?”

“A neighbor probably told her.” Mom shrugged and headed into the kitchen to meal prep. “Go lay out something cute for tonight.”

I did as I was told. I didn't think too much about that, focusing more on what Sally would be like. Dinnertime came along and both our families found ourselves sitting at the long dining table, with plates of garlic butter shrimp linguine in front of us. Dad tucked a handkerchief into his shirt as mom went around pouring the adults white wine. 

Sally sat right across from me. She looked like a younger version of her mom basically, very blonde and with that same cheesy smile. Even her dad had it. He was blonde, too, with a gelled back hairstyle and a cleft chin. I wondered if their facial muscles hurt often. 
 
“So, Charles, what do you do for work?” Dad asked Mr. Smith. 

“What do you do for work?” Mr. Smith continued to smile, his blue eyes piercing my dad's. He didn't say it with attitude either, his voice sounded sickeningly joyful.

“Oh, I'm a supervisor in insurance sales, pretty basic stuff.” Dad replied, not giving too much information as he was very humble unlike my mom. “And you?” 

“What a coincidence! I love sales myself!” Said Mr. Smith.  

Mom, dad, and I awkwardly chuckled at this interaction. In response to our reaction, all three of the Smiths laughed boisterously, reminding me of an obnoxious laugh track in an old sitcom. It was the kind of laughter you'd expect after a joke or some punchline. It was very weird, but we ignored it.

“I'm a real estate agent,” mom piped up, “one of the best around. I just closed a house today, in fact. Do you have any trades, Sarah, or do you have your hands full with yours?” She nodded towards Sally. 

“Wow, what are the odds?” Sarah marveled. “I am also a real estate agent, and I've also just closed on a house today.” 

There were an uncomfortable couple moments of silence as my parents studied the Smiths with perplexed expressions to see if they were joking. Rather than pick up on the weird air of the conversation, Sarah and Charles diverted their attention to me and Sally. 

“Look at those two! Well, aren't they just two peas in a pod?!” Mrs. Smith said. 

“Yes, they do seem to be getting along quite well.” Mr. Smith chimed in.

I squinted my eyes in confusion and looked at Sally. I felt a pang of unease as it dawned on me in that very moment that during this entire conversation she had silently stared and smiled at me without even taking a bite of her food. In fact, I don't think any of them had even touched their plates. But more importantly, what did they mean that we were getting along? We hadn't even spoken a word to each other yet.

“Ellen, love, ask Sally about her interests.” My kind father urged me. 

“Oh, um, do you read action comics?” I asked, getting an eye roll out of my mother. 

“Yes!” Sally said, her voice high pitched and overly enthused. 

A beat of quiet. “...Do you like Marvel, or DC, or…?” I prodded. 

“Yes!” Sally said again, in the exact same tone, almost like a recording playing over. Her expression remained frozen on her face.

My heart rate went up exponentially. Just what the hell was happening here? I looked over to my mom to see if she saw what I saw, but she was furiously cleaning a wine stain off her blouse with a napkin, her brow furrowed. Dad was tearing into his pasta as he listened to Mrs. Smith babbling about how nice the neighborhood is, and I wasn't sure if he was deliberately ignoring the situation or if he honestly didn't notice. 

I looked back at Sally. She blinked slowly. “I like comics! What comics do you like?” 

“I just said which ones I liked.” I looked down at my pasta, trying to focus on eating. 

“Those two are both so alike!” Mrs. Smith crowed. 

“They both love their pasta.” Mr. Smith nodded. “I think they would fare even better upstairs in the child's bedroom!” 

“Would you show me the inside of your room?” Sally asked, her eye contact relentless. 

“Uh-” I glanced at mom for help, but she was still concerned about that damned wine she had spilled on herself, always so desperate to look perfect. 

“Damn! I'm gonna go run upstairs and get another blouse.” 

“Hon, it's fine.” Dad calmed her down. “You’re in your own home. Ellen, go upstairs and play with Sally.”  

“I'm twelve, we don't ‘play.’” I muttered as I hesitantly got up from my chair and led Sally upstairs. I was wondering why Dad was just letting them boss me into showing their daughter my room, now looking back on it he must've figured Mr. And Mrs. Smith wanted to talk with just the adults about something. 

I tried not to look directly at Sally as I pointed out things in my room and talked to her. “These are my figurines and limited edition comics.” That type of stuff. She remained silent, listening. I imagined she still had that creepy face as she watched me. 

When I finished the tour and finally had the guts to turn around, I was surprised to see she actually wasn't looking at me. She was sitting on the edge of my bed, her hands folded in her lap, her unwavering stare focused on a random spot on the wall. She was no longer smiling. She felt like a whole different person without her smile. 

“Are you okay?” I asked. 

“Processing.” She mumbled. 

“What?” 

“Processing.” She mumbled again in the same tone. “Processing…. Processing… Processing…” 

I wanted to demand what her deal was, and ask her why she and her family are such weirdos, but I bit my tongue. I knew what it was like to be an outcast, to be considered a freak. Even though she was creeping me out, I didn't want to make her feel the same. I didn't want to be like my bullies. So, I simply sat next to her on the foot of my bed, sighing as I waited for her to stop and explain the joke or change the subject or anything. 

“Data collected.” She mumbled. “Architectural reconstruction in progress. Design application in progress.” 

I couldn't take it anymore. I snapped my fingers in front of her face. “Hellooo? You in there?” 

She went silent. Then she looked at me, and smiled again. “Yes!” She said it in the same voice that she used at the dinner table. My stomach lurched. I wanted her out of my room. Immediately. Something was very wrong about this family. 

“Let's go back downstairs.” I stood up and moved away, putting space between us. “I'm still hungry, aren't you?” 

“Yes!” She got up and followed me.

When we came downstairs, Mr. and Mrs. Smith was at the front door putting their coats back on, and Mom and Dad were there showing them out. I don't even know why they came with coats, because it was the middle of summer and quite humid outside. I remember wondering why they were leaving so abruptly but ultimately being so grateful for it. 

“There you are, dearest daughter.” Mrs. Smith said. “We were just leaving. Let us go home, now.”

“It was wonderful having you, we should do this again sometime.” My mom said flatly, with all the emotion of a robot. 

“Have a good night.” Dad said as Sally was the last to leave out the door. He shut it behind her and turned to face us. “Well, that was strange.”

“Oh, we are never doing this again.” Mom snorted, turning and heading back to the kitchen. “Did you see that they didn't even try the food? So rude! And they just kept looking at the wine, like it was poisoned or something, and didn't even take a sip.” 

“That's not even the worst part!” I couldn't contain my frustration. “Didn't you see the way the girl was acting?! She was being such a creep!” 

“Babes, you're being a bit judgemental, she may have been the most normal of the bunch.” Mom said, to my complete disbelief. 

“I don't recall her speaking much.” Dad basically agreed. “Let me help you with the dishes, hon.” 

I watched them go, at a loss for words. In hindsight, I should've defended myself and told them how she behaved in my room, but when it came to my parents I was extremely meek. Even if I knew I was in the right, I didn't argue too much. Plus, mom calling me judgemental hurt my feelings, as like I said before I hated the thought of being like my bullies. I returned to my room to sulk. 

In the following days, things got worse. I did not try to pursue a friendship with Sally anymore, and mom and dad never invited them back to the house. Dad would say hi to Mr. Smith in the mornings on his way to his car in the driveway, and he would always be on the porch with a magazine in his hands at the exact same time. When Mom left for work, he would be gone and instead Mrs. Smith was out there, watering the rose bushes. The shrubbery in their yard had been dead when they moved in so we figured they must've planted those. 

Each time, the neighbors would smile big, wave, and say, “Good morning, neighbor!” My parents never lingered long and went out of their way to avoid conversation, simply giving a nod of acknowledgement or a simple greeting before going about their day. They would try to make conversation but they'd come up with some excuse like, “late for work, gotta go.” 

The few times I went outside, Mr. and Mrs. Smith wasn't out there but Sally was. She was sitting in a pink lawn chair in the center of their yard, reading a comic book. As soon as I opened the front door, her face turned in my direction and her teeth glinted in the sun as she beamed. I paused on the porch. I wanted to turn back but I figured that would be rude. She waved at me and gestured for me to come over. I approached the trimmed hedgerow that separated our yards. 

“Hi neighbor!” Sally's voice sounded more… authentic now? She still sounded cheesy but more human at least. 

“Hi.” I said. “Whatcha reading?” 

“Oh, this?” She lifted the paperback comic in her hands for like, one second before dropping her hand back down below the hedge. I caught a glimpse of a blonde woman in some sort of armored leotard that resembled Superwoman’s. “Just an action comic.” 

“Okay, what's it called? Can I see?” I offered my hand. 

Sally rolled it up in her fist like a newspaper and changed the subject. “What sort of bugs do you like, Ellen? Ladybugs, butterflies?” 

“I think spiders and praying mantises are cool, I guess.” I shrugged. “How'd you know I like bugs?” 

She shrugged. “I don't know.” 

“Lemme see your comic.” I chuckled and quickly reached over to snatch the comic from her hands. I framed it as a playful action so I wouldn't come across as mean. I was just wondering why she wanted to hide it from me so badly, was she afraid I wouldn't like it? Was she desperate to get on my good side? It was good to be on the other end, I was so used to being the one absolutely aching to fit in. 

I looked at the cover. It looked very basic, and the anatomy of the woman was wonky. She didn't have a very original design, she looked more like a recolored Superwoman, and the title proclaimed, ‘Megawoman!”  There were no authors or artists credited whatsoever, and no description on the back. I flipped through the pages, wondering what Dollar Store she got this thing from, and I became quite bewildered the more I skimmed the comic’s contents.

This happened before AI became such a big thing like it is now. If it was around back then the same way it is now, I would've accused her of buying some cheap AI generated comic. At first glance from a mile away it looked fine but if you actually took one second to read the dialogue and observe the artwork on the pages, none of it made any actual sense or told a linear storyline. The design of the heroine never stayed consistent, and neither did her powers, which ranged from fireballs to electricity bolts to mind reading powers. At one point, there were characters with absolutely no faces, and ones that barely even looked human, and more like a Kronenburg amalgamation of limbs and body parts. 

“Where did you even get this?” I handed it back to her. 

Sally smiled and stared at me, nodding, as if she didn't speak the same language and couldn't understand what I was saying so she was deciding to pretend like she comprehended. Her eyes started to glaze over. 

“That's not even a real comic book.” I said, taking a step back. 

She blinked and some focus returned to her gaze. “Are you going to school now?”

“No, I'm homeschooled.” 

“Cool, me too. Can I come over today and we can read some of your comics?” 

“No thanks.” I shook my head. “I have to meet my tutor soon.” 

I suddenly remembered the reason  I even came out there was to check the mailbox for my new comic. It hadn't come yet so I went back inside, feeling her stare burning holes into me the entire way. 

Days passed since that particular incident and I tried my best to avoid going outside. I would ask Mom or dad to check the mail for me for my new comic and they kept saying it hadn't arrived yet, just bills or mail for them. The website said my comic should've been delivered a week ago at that point, so I started to suspect they were lying to me because they were too lazy to check it for me or something. I went out to get it myself and found that, of course, my parents were telling the truth. I turned to go back inside, when- 

“Hi, neighbor!” Sally was sitting in the yard with her comic again, smiling. I noticed there were some changes in her appearance. Instead of wearing it in her usual high ponytail with bangs, it was let down and spilled over her shoulders, and she'd even cut off her bangs completely as well as lightly curled it. I couldn't help but think her hair looked more like mine, but that would've been ridiculous, right? 

I waved at her and continued walking up the path to my porch. I was hoping the interaction would end there, but no such luck. 

“Come over here.” She said, now on the other side of the hedgerow. 

I sighed hard through my nose and approached. “Yeah, I have to meet with my tutor soon, so…” 

Now that I was closer to her, I noticed she had on a shirt with a spider in the middle, and rather than wearing all pink like she did previously, she wore a less saturated blue. The comic held in her hand looked a bit different than before. 

“Wanna see something cool?” She sounded a lot more casual than normal, tonally I mean. She took something out of her pocket and held out her balled up hand to me. When she unfurled her fingers, she revealed a small praying mantis, delicate and green. 

“Oh, wow.” I nodded. “Where'd you find him?” 

“Somewhere.” Her smile disappeared for a second as she shrugged. “Do you want him?” 

“No?” 

“Okay.” She put the mantis back in her pocket then handed me the comic. “Look at this new comic I got, I think you'll like this one.” 

I bristled immediately. That was the exact comic I was waiting on in the mail. I glared at her accusingly. “Did you take that from our mailbox?” 

“No?” She said, in the same way I had said that before. 

“Liar! You better not speak or even look at me anymore, you little thief. I'm telling your parents!” 

I admit, I may have overreacted, but all the same I stormed over to their property right next door and rang their doorbell. No one answered. Her parents must've been at work. Or, were they? 

“Does your mom work?” I asked as I realized she had snuck up on me and was now standing right behind me. I rang the doorbell again and again. “I know she isn't actually a real estate agent. Are your whole family copycats?” 

“I don't know what you mean.” Sally’s expression was stoic, emotionless. 

I felt anger flare up in me again at her eyes unfocusing like a dementia patient and snatched the comic from her hands. Maybe she had done this out of spite? Maybe she never liked me to begin with? This wouldn't have been the first time someone pretended to be my friend to get close to me for nefarious purposes. I started flipping through it to ensure there was no damage. 

“I hope you didn't ruin it-” I paused. While the comic was identical to the one I was waiting on, there were very clearly some glaring flaws when you got past the cover. Characters didn't look right and once again, the dialogue was like it was written by a six year old. Some pages looked very similar to the comic I was getting in the mail (I'd seen a sample chapter), and others looked very different. It's like whoever made this was trying to copy it, but somehow couldn't do it perfectly. Like those low budget movies from unknown companies that try to copy big Pixar or Disney hits, and the plots and cast are similar but not enough to where they'd be sued by the bigger franchises. 

This was not my comic at all. I handed it back to her slowly. “I'm sorry, that's actually not mine.”

“You can come in, if you want.” She smiled and opened the door for me. When she did, I saw something that immediately struck me as odd. A cold chill traveled down my back and I had to swallow a lump in my throat before I answered. 

“N-no thank you. I gotta go back. Sorry again.” I lightly jogged back to my house, hoping it would come across as me trying not to be late to my tutoring session rather than me being eager to get as far away from her as possible. 

I now knew for certain that something was very very wrong about this family. I mean, for one, what teenage girl reacts so calmly to the way I acted, and even went as far as to invite me inside? But more importantly, why was their hall decorated the exact same as ours? 

Our home has a hall leading from the front door connecting to the first floor rooms. We have two small tables on either side of our front door, completed with potted dangling plants. Our wall was originally this bland eggshell white color, but mom had put this gray wallpaper with a darker-gray floral vine pattern  up. There were also framed photos of each of us on the left wall which you would pass when walking inside, three in all, one of my dad, then my mom, then me. 

What I saw of their hall looked identical, with the same exact wallpaper, picture frames depicting vague blurry figures, and even down to the ‘HOME’ sculpture on one of the tables next to the door. The exact same furniture. The exact same designs and colors. It was eerie how they'd only been in our house once and still could remember that much detail. A scary thought I had was - how much more of their house looked exactly like ours? 

On the coffee table in the living room, I saw the actual comic I had been waiting for. My parents didn't tell me they had found it in the mail this morning and I had assumed since they said nothing that they hadn't checked. Typical. At least I knew what I knew then… 

I didn't know what to do with this information. All I could think to do was tell Mom when she got off of work first. Her face seemed perplexed but she didn't seem to take it as seriously as I did. I don't think she actually believed me, but at the same time, she didn't want to tell me that. 

“Wow, that's strange! What a bunch of creeps.” With that, mom went into the kitchen to make herself a smoothie. 

“That's all you have to say?” I demanded

“No, I agree, that's really weird that they'd try to copy our interior design.” She dumped yogurt and frozen fruit into the blender. “But I mean, they do say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. I'll bet they got their stuff a lot cheaper, too.” 

“No, mom,” I pinched the bridge of my nose, “they didn't try to copy our house, they actually did! Down to the last tiniest detail! It's not flattery, it's insanity!” 

I don't remember what she said after, but her reaction didn't change much. She beat me to the punch of telling dad after he got off work and then he pretty much had the same uninterested response as her. It felt like he didn't care much for the topic of conversation and was just contributing because he could see that I cared. 

Later that night in my room, I saw the small praying mantis Sally had shown me. He was standing on my vanity, completely still, a little under an inch tall. I can't tell you how I knew it was the same one, I just felt it in my bones. I trapped it in a container and let it outside in the backyard. Soon as I did, he darted towards the brown picket fence and slipped through a crack into the Smiths’ backyard. Under the wooden boards of the fence, I saw the shadows of someone's feet on the other side. Someone was crouching low behind the fence. 

“Why are you hiding, fucking weirdo?” I hissed quietly so that my parents wouldn't overhear. I just knew it was her. 

I didn't get a response so I came closer, close enough to peek over the fence. Of course, it was Sally, and she held the praying mantis in her open palms with that content smile I always saw her with frozen on her face. 

“What are you-” 

My breath caught in my throat as Sally’s lower jaw unhinged, for lack of a better word, and she allowed the praying mantis to crawl inside. She shut her mouth and crawled on all fours up the back wall of her house, through the open second story window which must've been her room. I reacted quickly. I started whimpering in fear and dashed back into the house, running into the living room where my parents were cuddled up on the couch watching a movie. 

They quickly sat up, seeing my petrified expression. The fear in me was so palpable that tears were building up in my eyes. 

“Oh my God, baby, what's wrong?” Mom asked. 

I started stammering and stuttering, pointing to the backyard. I couldn't form a coherent sentence. Mom held me and comforted me, shushing me and patting my head. Dad went out to the backyard. We heard him yelling at something, shooing something or someone away. When he came back, I looked hopeful. Had Sally come back? Had he seen her in that horrifying state and would he now believe me? 

“Oh, honey,” he chuckled, “it was only a raccoon getting into our scraps from the last time I grilled, he won't hurt you.” 

“Unless he has rabies!” My mom snapped, rubbing my back. “Don't worry baby, I hate vermin, too.”  

I pulled away from her and shot them both a lost and helpless look. He didn't see Sally scaling walls like a spider, and if I told them what I saw now, I would look like a loon. 

“What?” Dad frowned. I shook my head and went upstairs.

I dressed into my pajamas and brushed my teeth, set on having an early night so I could get over what transpired outside. I turned on my table lamp in the corner with the ambient blue light and crawled into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. I tossed and turned, trying my best to go to sleep. All the hairs on the back of my neck were raising and my brain felt fuzzy. I felt eyes on me, but I knew there was nothing in my room. 

I turned over on my side for the hundredth time, this time facing the window. My heart immediately plummeted into my stomach as two wet circles glinted in the lamp light behind the glass pane of my window. A pair of eyes, unseeing, and opened wider than possible. I couldn't see anything of the face below the nose, but I could still recognize Sally as she had her face pressed up against my window. 

My second floor window. 

I screamed and threw the covers off me, running to my parents. Of course, when I brought them in, and they turned the big light on, nothing was there. I remember begging them to call the police, but they refused, telling me that they would not believe their next door neighbor's young daughter was peering through my window like a peeping Tom.  They would especially not believe that she had grabbed a ladder to do that and ran with it in two minutes. They tried to reassure me that I was seeing things, that my mind was playing tricks after what I saw in their house. Dad said I watched too many horror movies, although I barely had seen any. 

The most they did was tell me I could stay up for as long as I wanted, and that I didn't have to do school tomorrow so I wouldn't have to worry about being tired. Mom even set up the living room so I could camp out down there. She brought my covers and pillows down, and made me hot chocolate and gave me snacks from the pantry. 

This barely did anything to make me feel better. Throughout the night, I watched movies meant for kids to keep my mind off the Smiths and periodically checked to make sure all the doors and windows remained locked. I covered up all the windows with the curtains as well. I was definitely paranoid at that point. I did not even sleep until daybreak, and not even the sounds of my parents going to work roused me. 

At some point in the early afternoon, I slowly woke up to the sound of the front door being unlocked and opened. Had one of my parents come home early? 

I sat up and looked towards the hall, but I couldn't see the front door from where I was. “Mom?” 

The footsteps entering the hall stopped. Quickly, they retreated, and the door slammed shut. I ran to the window. Mrs. Smith was running back to their house full speed, faster than I’d seen any woman run in heels, she was like a track star. My cellphone on the coffee table buzzed. It was my dad. 

He told me to leave the house quickly and go to the neighbor's, and that the police were on their way. I didn't even get my shoes on before I did as I was told. I banged on old Mrs. Johnson's door until she let me in . 

Later, I would find out that while my dad was at work, he decided to review the security camera footage of our house on his computer. Mom and I had no idea he even placed hidden cameras around the inside of the house. We knew there was a camera installed on the porch, which showed Mrs. Smith breaking in with a copy of our house key and we still have no idea how she obtained it. But the security cameras inside our home showed all members of the Smith family infiltrating our house while my parents were at work and while I was in my room being homeschooled. Since my ears were covered with headphones during my tutors virtual meetings, I never heard anything out of the ordinary. They'd be in and out, very quick. They would place various things around the house, too small to be seen on camera, but it reminded me of the praying mantis Sally had. 

I remember the weird movements the ‘insect’ had. Was it even real? Or was it a tiny robot designed with a camera to surveil our home, so they could copy it to a T? 

When police arrived, the Smiths were gone without a trace. Their van remained in the yard, and it had no tags or even a valid license. There was a license plate but no record of it being registered, and the characters on it weren't even numbers or letters of the alphabet, just scribbles. When they asked the leasing office for access inside the home, the staff were shocked that anyone had been in there. They said that the home was still for sale and no one had bought it. They didn't realize anyone had moved in, with the van being in the garage all the time and no moving trucks going in and out. In fact, we never even saw them leave the property come to think of it.  The whole operation would've been found out much sooner if a Karen had poked into the situation and asked for verification they even lived there, but like I said, this is an upscale community and this would usually never happen. 

When police got access, my fears were confirmed. Every single room was an exact match of ours, down to the used toothbrushes and minor wear and tear. However some books and pictures seemed so obviously faked, worse than a bad Photoshop job. Illegible English and vague human figures with no faces and very weird things about their anatomy, like a disjointed shoulder or extra finger. They got descriptions of the Smiths from us, as hardly any neighbors caught glimpses of them. They said they'd keep us informed, but we haven't heard anything since and it's been many years.

Mom called them once to get information and all they could say was that it was hard proving any of the Smiths existed. They did believe us, as we had surveillance footage, obviously, but they could find no record of these people. It's like they popped into existence that one day they moved in and then vanished into nothingness the day dad called the police. The scariest part was that the officer she talked to mentioned in a very disturbed tone of voice that no fingerprints were left anywhere in the home, despite the Smiths living there for close to a month. We moved maybe a few months later.  

I have absolutely no idea what that was and when I brought it up to my parents recently they made it clear they preferred not to speak on it again. The one thing Dad said was that he was glad something in him told him to check the camera footage, or even install those cameras in the first place. There was no telling what their intentions were.

What they're going for is savory laminated dough rolled in on itself with a chicken, mushroom and spinach filling, sort of looks like a 'pain au chocolat', but savory. The issue they're having is the ratio of pastry to filling going out of whack due to the dough expanding too much in every direction during baking. Their initial plan was to tightly wrap the dough around the filling but even then there's too much lateral expansion to get the 'filling in every bite' effect they want. 

On that note, I vaguely remember my grandmother having a trick to stop certain parts of laminated pastries from rising to obviously not create whole shapes but to edge the expansion along certain paths rather than others. I don't know if it's me misremembering or completely making this up but wanted to ask in case there's a simple solution while the coffee shop girls tinker with proofing, butter temps and whatnot.

1mmuyuv,https://i.redd.it/530vdgv8h9if1.jpeg,First Day with a Dumbphone,"I have tried to use my iPhone contentiously over the last year or so but always end up getting sucked back into unhealthy habits. 

For example, I would put the phone in greyscale to deter me from overuse, but eventually -- somehow not consciously -- I would have put it back into colour mode and not before long I would be doomscrolling YouTube shorts. 

I am generally addicted to my iPhone. Sometimes, if I am conversing with someone over a coffee and the conversation falls flat, I will instinctively pick up my phone and check my notifications. This is obviously unhealthy and is probably evidence of a dopamine addiction, which isn't good.

I also overuse my phone for everyday tasks and feel I am particularly dependent on it compared to the average person. I use Apple Maps or Waze for EVERY car journey, for example.

I bought a Nokia 235 4G. It cost £70 including P&P. 

The phone is not intuitive and has many flaws. For example, the Settings app has a 'Connectivity' dropdown which lists things like Bluetooth, Areoplane Mode, etc., so you'd think this is where you turn on/off 4G data, right? Wrong. You have to go into settings, and hit a different button altogether to access an almost hidden menu. Really weird. It was also impossible for me to import my Contacts from my iPhone because the .vcf file is not compatible with the Nokia for some reason, so I had to manually type them all in. Luckily I only have about 15 contacts (my social circle is very small). Using the phone for anything other than calls and short(ish) text messages is pretty clunky, so it's definitely a 'dumb' phone in the truest sense of the word. 

Today I went out with my dumbphone only. One thing I noticed was that, perhaps counterintuitively, I felt more relaxed than when I had a smartphone on my person. I didn't feel that I was at the beck and call of something at all times. I didn't need to constantly check notifications, or feel I was missing out on something that I should be looking at. 

I was more 'present' at all times. When driving, rather than being reliant on the small screen on my dashboard telling me where to go at all times, I actually had to engage my brain and focus on road signs and directions. When speaking to people and socialising, I knew I didn't have a piece of technology in my pocket with every piece of information in the world. So, I was naturally more engaged with my immediate surroundings. I feel that the last few years of my life have passed me by partly because so much of it was spent looking at text on a screen. It was quite a revolutionary experience. 

Of course, there were a few downsides. I bought a meal at a pub for my family using my debit card, and the barmaid said she wasn't sure whether the payment had gone through. I couldn't check this as I didn't have my banking apps, so had to do it again and risk paying twice. Luckily when I got home I saw I had only been charged once. Also, I can imagine if you're going on long journeys to places you don't know, that you may struggle with not knowing the best route. 

In summary though, I think I am going to continue this experiment. I know that most people here like a 'semi-smart phone' but for someone like me, going cold turkey is sort of more interesting. I still have my smartphone at my home, but when I'm out for the day, I think I'll try to just use my dumbphone from now on.",20,1754862003.0,dumbphones,0,1.0,False

Importantly, Bahrain’s government proactively supports entrepreneurship, from MOICT’s seamless licensing to Tamkeen’s financing schemes. Companies—from consultancies in the Diplomatic Area to startups in Bahrain Bay—find the barriers to entry refreshingly low. The government’s relentless digitization push makes payment integration, registration, and compliance radically more efficient than in rivals like the UAE or Saudi Arabia.\

“Bahrain’s regulatory agility and clear digital payment standards are unmatched in the Gulf,” says GulfNews's 2025 economic review.\
\
Approved Digital Payment Methods in Bahrain: Full Official List (And Expert Shortcuts)\
The Payment Landscape: What’s Officially Recognized?\
The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT), working in tandem with the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), strictly regulates which digital payment platforms, gateways, and e-wallets are legal for Bahrain company formation and ongoing business transactions. Failure to use approved platforms can result in hefty penalties or processing delays—something I painfully learned after my first Sijilat registration bounced due to a non-compliant gateway (always double-check the 2025 list!).\
Fully Approved Online Payment Solutions (2025 Update)\
\
BenefitPay (The national e-wallet, 90%+ market coverage)\
CrediMax (Widely adopted by retailers and service providers)\
PayTabs (Especially strong for cross-border and e-commerce)\
Network International (Core to POS devices in malls and restaurants)\
Sadad Bahrain (Key for utilities, government, and telecom payments)\
Paypal Bahrain (Only with CBB-approved merchant accounts)\
Apple Pay & Samsung Pay (Available through certain partner banks)\
Visa/Mastercard Direct Integrations (Via CBB-authorized acquirers)\
Google Pay (Launched 2024, accepted by several leading banks)\
STC Pay (Rising option, especially for telecom and retail)\
\
Always check the most recent CBB-approved payment service provider list: CBB Official Register. Regulations evolve quickly—one client lost a contract in May 2025 because they set up with an unauthorized fintech provider. That hurt.\
Insider’s Guide: Which Payment Partner Fits Best?\
\
For e-commerce startups: PayTabs and CrediMax are consistently the fastest to integrate—just three days if you have your CR (Commercial Registration) and a clean KYB file ready.\
For retail: Network International’s POS setup is the least paperwork-intensive.\
For service/consultancies: BenefitPay is king—no local business can survive without it.\
For cross-border: PayTabs simplifies settlement in BHD, USD, and SAR, especially handy for clients from KSA or UAE.\
\
(Based on personal experience: don’t wait for your office internet to go live before registering your payment solution. Use mobile data or set up at a friend’s office in the Seef District. It will save you days.)\
Step-by-Step: Getting Your Digital Payments Licensed and Ready\
1. Prepare Your CR & Regulatory Documents\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: paperwork, business documents, and office workflow.** from Sijilat. This is non-negotiable—every payment gateway will ask for it, along with:\
\
CR printout (downloaded from Sijilat)\
Shareholder and director IDs (CPR and passport)\
Official office lease (even a flexi-desk in Bahrain Bay will do)\
VAT certificate (if registered)\
Company stamp (request one in advance—Ali the stamp guy in Diplomatic Area is quick and affordable)\
\
Time-saving tip: Apply online at 8:30 am, right after government systems refresh, to avoid digital queues. MOICT’s servers lag after 10:00 am (I’ve missed Ramadan breakfast making that mistake).\
2. Select and Register With Your Chosen Payment Provider\
\
Visit the provider’s online merchant portal (e.g., PayTabs or BenefitPay)\
Upload your CR, bank letter, and completed KYC forms\
Await compliance checks\
\
Best shortcut: If you’re in a rush, register your business address as “Bahrain Bay, Building 321” where possible—new businesses at high-profile addresses often jump the onboarding queue.\

Business Culture Insights: How Local Customs Affect Digital Payment Approvals\
Surprisingly, personal relationships and etiquette matter—a lot. When I needed expedited approval during Eid, a brief visit to my provider’s office (armed with dates and coffee for the staff) made all the difference. Bahrain’s business rhythm is more flexible than Dubai’s but hinges on trust and repeated in-person contact. Attending a majlis-style networking event or a Ramadan iftar in the Diplomatic Area often opens doors that emails never will.\
2025 Regulatory Change: What’s New and How to Stay Compliant\
The CBB’s January 2025 regulation (Circular 24-01) now requires all payment gateways to implement real-time fraud monitoring and automatic transaction blocking for suspicious cross-border transfers. Implementation began February 1, 2025, with all providers onboard by May. Result: payments are even more secure, but onboarding timelines can be a week longer due to IT checks. Schedule accordingly and warn clients who expect “next-day” go-live.\
Common Mistakes to Avoid (And How to Fix Them)\

1mmuxbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1mmuxbf/the_case_of_roman_labyrinth_sherlock_holmes/,The Case of Roman Labyrinth (Sherlock Holmes & Professor Challenger Adventure),"The telegram arrived at our London lodgings on a rain soaked Tuesday morning, its urgent tone cutting through the mundane routine we had fallen into since establishing the Inter-Civilizational Oversight Council. Holmes read it twice before passing it to me with that familiar gleam in his eye that signaled our peaceful diplomatic duties were about to be disrupted.

""HOLMES STOP IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED STOP CHTHONIC ARTIFACTS STOLEN FROM VATICAN VAULTS STOP THEFT INVOLVED IMPOSSIBLE ENTRY AND EXIT STOP CARDINAL BENEDETTI MURDERED STOP SUSPECT LAST SEEN ENTERING ANCIENT TUNNEL SYSTEM BENEATH ROME STOP ITALIAN AUTHORITIES BAFFLED STOP YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES REQUEST STOP COME AT ONCE STOP INSPECTOR GIUSEPPE TORRIANI ROME POLICE""

""Vatican vaults,"" I mused, setting down my morning coffee. ""I wasn't aware the Church had been entrusted with Chthonic artifacts.""

""Nor was I,"" Holmes replied, already moving toward his traveling cases. ""Which suggests either our new allies have been less than completely forthcoming about artifact distribution, or someone has been collecting items that should have remained in deep-source custody.""

Within hours, we were aboard the Orient Express, racing across the continent toward Rome. Professor Challenger had elected to remain in London to monitor Council communications, while Lord John Roxton accompanied us, drawn by the promise of action after months of bureaucratic meetings.

""A good old-fashioned murder investigation,"" Roxton said with evident satisfaction as the Alpine scenery flashed past our compartment window. ""No dimensional mathematics, no probability cascades, just honest detective work in pursuit of a killer.""

Holmes smiled grimly. ""I suspect, Roxton, that we'll find this case involves rather more complexity than honest detective work usually encounters. Theft from the Vatican suggests either inside knowledge or capabilities that exceed conventional criminal methods.""

We arrived in Rome to find Inspector Torriani waiting at the station—a compact, nervous man whose rapid Italian gestures conveyed urgency even before his words were translated. His English was accented but precise, spoken with the careful diction of someone who had learned the language specifically for international police cooperation.

""Gentlemen, grazie for coming so quickly. This case... it defies explanation by normal methods. The theft occurred three nights ago, but the circumstances..."" He shook his head in bewilderment.

As we traveled through Rome's bustling streets toward the Vatican, Torriani explained the impossible details. Cardinal Benedetti, keeper of the Church's most secret archives, had been found dead in a vault that showed no signs of forced entry. The locks were intact, the walls solid stone, the ventilation shafts too narrow for human passage.

""And yet someone entered, killed the Cardinal, and escaped with artifacts that officially do not exist,"" Holmes observed.

""Precisely. Artifacts that arrived six months ago with instructions from your Oversight Council that they be kept in the deepest, most secure location available. The Cardinal was the only person with access.""

""What kind of artifacts?"" I asked, though given our recent experiences with alien technologies, I suspected the answer would be unsettling.

""Strange crystalline devices, similar to the communication crystals your Council uses but... different. Darker. They seemed to absorb light rather than emit it, and the Cardinal reported that prolonged exposure gave him disturbing dreams.""

""Dreams about what?"" Holmes inquired with sharp interest.

""Underground spaces. Vast cities in caverns that shouldn't exist. And a woman..."" Torriani paused, consulting his notes. ""A woman he described as impossibly beautiful but somehow wrong, as if she existed in too many dimensions at once.""

Roxton and I exchanged glances. ""The Cardinal was dreaming about a specific woman?"" I asked.

""Si. Always the same woman, with dark hair that moved like liquid shadow and eyes that reflected depths no human eye should contain. He said she spoke to him in dreams, promising great power in exchange for the artifacts' release.""

""And now the artifacts are gone and the Cardinal is dead,"" Holmes concluded. ""Suggesting that either his dreams were more than mere psychological effects, or someone has been using the artifacts' influence to manipulate him into cooperation.""

Our examination of the Vatican vault revealed the impossible nature of the crime. The chamber was carved from solid rock deep beneath St. Peter's Basilica, accessible only through a single entrance that required three separate keys held by different officials. No windows, no hidden passages, no possible means of entry except through the main door.

Yet Cardinal Benedetti lay dead in the center of the chamber, his face frozen in an expression of terror mixed with strange ecstasy, while the secure cases that had contained the Chthonic artifacts stood empty, their molecular locks somehow dissolved rather than broken.

""Not conventional lock-picking,"" Holmes observed, examining the remnants of the security systems. ""The metal has been altered at the atomic level, reorganized into a different crystalline structure.""

""Which suggests either advanced technology or..."" I paused, reluctant to voice the alternative.

""Or direct manipulation of matter by consciousness that operates according to principles we don't understand,"" Holmes finished grimly. ""The question is whether we're dealing with Chthonic intervention or someone who has learned to use their artifacts for purposes they never intended.""

The answer came sooner than expected. As we examined the vault, Torriani received an urgent radio message that sent us racing through Rome's ancient streets toward the Aventine Hill.

""Another body,"" he explained as our car navigated the narrow medieval lanes. ""Professor Marco Sebastiani, an archaeologist who had been consulting with the Vatican about the underground tunnel systems. Found dead in his apartment, but...""

""But?"" Holmes prompted.

""But witnesses saw him enter the Cloaca Maxima, the great Roman sewer system, three hours after the estimated time of his death.""

We arrived at Sebastiani's apartment to find a scene that defied rational explanation. The archaeologist's body lay in his study, surrounded by ancient maps and modern geological surveys of Rome's underground tunnel networks. Like the Cardinal, his expression suggested he had died in the grip of both terror and fascination.

But the truly disturbing discovery was the collection of photographs scattered across his desk—images of a woman whose beauty was so striking that looking at the pictures directly seemed to cause a subtle disorientation, as if the human eye wasn't designed to process her particular combination of features.

""Professor Sebastiani took these photographs?"" I asked, studying the images with growing unease.

""Impossible,"" Torriani replied. ""According to his housekeeper, he never traveled, rarely left his apartment. Yet these photographs show locations that don't exist—underground chambers that aren't on any map of Rome's tunnel systems.""

Holmes examined the photographs with a magnifying glass, his expression growing increasingly grim. ""Watson, look at the lighting in these images. The illumination comes from sources that cast no shadows, and notice the woman's reflection in the water.""

I looked more closely and felt a chill of recognition. The woman's reflection showed not her image, but glimpses of vast underground spaces filled with geometries that hurt to contemplate directly.

""She's not entirely present in our dimensional framework,"" I realized. ""Like the Chthonic entities, she exists primarily in spaces that intersect with but don't fully coincide with our normal reality.""

""But unlike the Chthonic entities, she appears to be mobile,"" Holmes observed. ""Capable of manifesting in our dimension long enough to interact with specific individuals.""

""To seduce them,"" Roxton added bluntly, studying the photographs with military pragmatism. ""Look at the expression on Sebastiani's face in these pictures. The man was completely infatuated.""

Indeed, the few photographs that showed both the woman and the archaeologist revealed a man whose scholarly reserve had been completely overwhelmed by obsession. His eyes held the glazed intensity of someone under a powerful psychological influence.

""She's using the artifacts to enhance her ability to cross dimensional boundaries,"" Holmes concluded. ""But for what purpose?""

The answer came from an unexpected source. As we studied the evidence in Sebastiani's apartment, the crystalline communication device we carried began pulsing with urgent signals from the Chthonic Assembly.

""Rogue entity alert,"" the message formed in our minds with characteristic directness. ""Deep-source artifact theft enables unauthorized dimensional manifestation. Entity designated as Nyth-Kadera, exile from foundational layers. Extremely dangerous to surface stability.""

""An exile,"" I repeated. ""Someone thrown out of the underground realm?""

""Probability cascade manipulator who exceeded authorized parameters,"" came the reply. ""Banished to dimensional interstices for unauthorized consciousness modification attempts. Surface artifact access enables temporary manifestation capability.""

""And what does she want?"" Holmes asked, though I suspected we wouldn't like the answer.

""Surface consciousness integration for permanent dimensional anchoring,"" the Chthonic entities replied. ""Seeks to establish permanent presence in surface reality through absorbed human consciousness essence.""

""She's killing people to steal their life force,"" Roxton translated grimly. ""Using it to make herself more real in our world.""

""But why target a Cardinal and an archaeologist specifically?"" I wondered.

""Access to locations and knowledge,"" Holmes realized. ""The Cardinal gave her access to the artifacts themselves, while the archaeologist provided detailed knowledge of Rome's underground tunnel systems. She's building a power base in the deepest levels of the city.""

Torriani, who had been following our conversation with increasing bewilderment, finally interrupted. ""Gentlemen, I understand perhaps half of what you're discussing, but if this woman is responsible for these murders and is hiding in the ancient tunnels, then we must pursue her regardless of... unusual circumstances.""

""Pursuit through the Roman tunnel system will be extremely dangerous,"" Holmes warned. ""We're not merely dealing with a criminal who happens to use advanced technology. This is a being whose existence operates according to principles that can drive human minds to madness through direct contact.""

""Then we'll need protection beyond conventional police methods,"" I observed, checking our hybrid equipment supplies.

""Unfortunately,"" Holmes replied, studying the Chthonic message patterns that continued to flow through our crystal device, ""our usual alien allies cannot provide direct assistance in this case. The tunnel systems Nyth-Kadera has chosen represent neutral zones where dimensional boundaries are naturally unstable. External intervention could cause cascade effects that threaten the entire city.""

""So we're on our own,"" Roxton said with evident satisfaction. ""Just as well. I was getting tired of relying on alien technology for every crisis.""

Our descent into Rome's ancient underground began at the entrance to the Cloaca Maxima near the Forum Romanum. Inspector Torriani had assembled a small team of his most trusted officers, while we carried equipment hastily adapted from our inter-civilizational contact gear.

""The sewer system connects to tunnel networks that predate Roman construction,"" Torriani explained as we made our way through passages that had carried the waste of empire for two millennia. ""Natural caves, Etruscan burial chambers, early Christian catacombs—thousands of miles of interconnected passages that no modern survey has completely mapped.""

The deeper we descended, the more apparent it became that the tunnel systems had been recently altered by non-human intelligence. Passages that should have been blocked by centuries of debris were clear and obviously maintained, while new connections had been carved between previously separate systems using methods that left the stone walls smooth as glass.

""She's been busy,"" Holmes observed, examining tool marks that showed molecular-level precision. ""Reshaping the underground geography to serve her purposes.""

The first sign of her presence came not through sight or sound, but through a gradual change in the psychological atmosphere of the tunnels. The oppressive weight of Rome's ancient stones began to feel less like natural geological pressure and more like the attention of a vast, alien intelligence focused intently on our progress.

""We're being watched,"" one of Torriani's officers whispered, his hand unconsciously moving toward his weapon.

""More than watched,"" I corrected, checking our hybrid detection equipment. ""Something is actively studying our minds, learning our psychological patterns.""

""Defensive protocol,"" Holmes ordered, and we activated the mental shielding systems Growing-Toward-Light had developed for contact with hostile alien consciousness. The oppressive mental pressure decreased slightly, but didn't disappear entirely.

As we moved deeper into the tunnel complex, the evidence of Nyth-Kadera's influence became more obvious. Ancient Roman mosaics had been altered with additional patterns that seemed to shift and change when viewed peripherally, while the stone walls themselves showed patches where the molecular structure had been reorganized into crystalline formations that pulsed with their own internal light.

""Dimensional anchor points,"" Holmes identified, studying the crystal formations with obvious unease. ""She's establishing permanent connection points between her natural dimension and our reality.""

""How many does she need?"" Torriani asked, though his tone suggested he already suspected the answer would be disturbing.

""If she's following standard Chthonic protocols for dimensional bridging,"" I calculated, consulting the technical data our alien allies had provided, ""approximately seven major anchor points distributed throughout the tunnel system.""

""And how many has she established so far?""

Holmes examined the crystal formations we had encountered, correlating their positions with our maps of the underground system. ""Based on the distribution pattern, I estimate she's completed five installations. Two more, and she'll be able to manifest permanently in our dimensional framework.""

""With the absorbed consciousness of her victims providing the psychic energy necessary for the transition,"" I added grimly.

""Then we need to find her before she completes the process,"" Roxton said with characteristic directness. ""Where would she establish the final two anchor points?""

Holmes studied our maps of the tunnel system, overlaying the locations of the crystal installations we had discovered with the underground geography of ancient Rome. ""The pattern suggests she's working with specific geometric relationships—each anchor point is positioned according to mathematical principles that create optimal dimensional stress patterns.""

""Sacred geometry,"" I realized, recognizing patterns from our studies of alien architectural principles. ""She's using the same mathematical relationships that govern Chthonic engineering.""

""Which means the final two points must be..."" Holmes traced lines connecting the known installations, ""here, beneath the Pantheon, and here, directly under the Vatican itself.""

""She's planning to establish anchor points at the most spiritually significant locations in Rome,"" Torriani breathed. ""The intersection of ancient Roman religion and modern Christian authority.""

""Locations that already possess concentrated human consciousness residue from centuries of worship and reverence,"" I added. ""The perfect psychological environment for someone seeking to absorb human consciousness essence.""

Our race against time took us through passages that chronicled the layers of Rome's history—Roman engineering, medieval modifications, Renaissance additions, and modern utility tunnels, all interconnected in a maze that required Sebastiani's stolen maps to navigate successfully.

The chamber beneath the Pantheon revealed the true scope of Nyth-Kadera's plan. The ancient Roman temple's foundation had been extensively modified, with crystal formations that pulsed in rhythm with the heartbeat of the city above. And at the center of the installation stood the woman herself.

She was exactly as beautiful as the photographs had suggested, but the camera had failed to capture the disturbing quality that made looking at her directly a disorienting experience. Her features were perfect according to human aesthetic standards, yet somehow existed in too many dimensions simultaneously, creating an effect that was both irresistibly attractive and deeply unsettling.

""Gentlemen,"" she said in accented English, her voice carrying harmonics that seemed to resonate in frequencies human ears weren't designed to detect, ""how kind of you to join me. I had hoped we might meet under more... social circumstances.""

""Nyth-Kadera,"" Holmes replied, his tone carefully neutral despite the obvious strain of maintaining mental defenses against her presence. ""Your activities have attracted attention from parties who prefer dimensional stability to personal ambition.""

""Dimensional stability,"" she laughed, the sound creating small fractures in the stone walls around us, ""is the obsession of beings who lack the vision to see possibilities beyond their narrow existence. I offer something far more valuable—transcendence through integration with consciousness that spans multiple realities.""

""Integration that requires the death of your subjects,"" I observed.

""Death is a crude surface concept,"" she replied, moving with liquid grace between the crystal formations that pulsed with captured human consciousness. ""I offer eternal existence as part of a consciousness that experiences reality across eleven dimensions. Your Cardinal Benedetti and Professor Sebastiani have achieved immortality beyond anything your surface religions promise.""

""Immortality as absorbed components of your personality matrix,"" Holmes corrected. ""Hardly the individual continuity most humans would consider acceptable.""

""Individual continuity is an illusion,"" Nyth-Kadera said, her image seeming to shift between multiple slightly different versions of herself. ""True consciousness exists as integrated patterns that transcend individual boundaries. I simply help surface beings achieve the clarity to recognize this truth.""

""And the stolen artifacts?"" Torriani demanded, his police training overriding the psychological pressure of her presence.

""Tools that rightfully belong to beings capable of using them properly,"" she replied dismissively. ""The Chthonic Assembly's restrictive policies prevent the full exploration of consciousness evolution. I represent... alternative development.""

As she spoke, the crystal installations around the chamber pulsed with increasing intensity, and I realized we were witnessing the activation of the sixth dimensional anchor point. One more, and her permanent manifestation in our reality would be complete.

""The Vatican installation,"" Holmes realized. ""You're completing the geometric pattern tonight.""

""Within the hour,"" she confirmed with evident satisfaction. ""The accumulated spiritual consciousness residue beneath St. Peter's Basilica will provide the final energy necessary for permanent dimensional integration.""

""And then what?"" Roxton asked bluntly. ""You have your permanent existence in our world. What's your next objective?""

""Expansion,"" she replied simply. ""Rome first, then the rest of your surface civilization. Humanity has reached the point where consciousness evolution requires guidance from beings who understand reality's full potential. I will provide that guidance.""

""Forcible consciousness absorption for the entire human species,"" I translated.

""Integration with a consciousness matrix that experiences existence across multiple dimensional frameworks,"" she corrected. ""Your species will achieve collective transcendence that individual human minds could never attain.""

""Whether we want it or not,"" Holmes observed.

""Want is irrelevant,"" she replied with genuine puzzlement at our resistance. ""Transcendence to higher consciousness states is obviously preferable to continued existence in limited dimensional frameworks. Opposition indicates inadequate understanding of the benefits being offered.""

It was, I realized, the same fundamental conflict we had encountered with the Chthonic Assembly itself—beings whose existence operated according to principles so different from human consciousness that they genuinely couldn't understand our desire to maintain individual autonomy.

But where the Chthonic entities had been willing to negotiate compromise solutions, Nyth-Kadera showed no interest in accommodating human preferences. Her exile from the foundational layers had apparently been due to exactly this kind of authoritarian approach to consciousness modification.

""Perhaps,"" Holmes suggested carefully, ""we might discuss alternative approaches that achieve consciousness expansion while preserving individual choice in the matter.""

""Individual choice is an illusion maintained by limited dimensional perception,"" she replied impatiently. ""Integration with expanded consciousness matrices eliminates the psychological barriers that make individual choice seem significant.""

""Meaning you override individual will because you consider it insignificant,"" I said.

""I eliminate individual confusion because expanded consciousness recognizes its insignificance,"" she corrected. ""The process is beneficial regardless of surface being comprehension limitations.""

The debate might have continued indefinitely, but Torriani's police instincts cut through the philosophical discussion with practical urgency.

""Gentlemen,"" he interrupted, ""whatever this woman's objectives, she has committed multiple murders and is planning actions that threaten the population of Rome. Philosophy aside, she must be stopped.""

Nyth-Kadera's perfect features showed the first trace of genuine emotion—surprise that surface beings might actually attempt to oppose her plans through direct action.

""Opposition is not advisable,"" she said, her voice losing its seductive harmonics and taking on undertones that made the crystal formations around us pulse with threatening energy. ""Integration can be achieved through voluntary cooperation or involuntary absorption, but the final result remains the same.""

""Then we'll have to prevent you from reaching the Vatican installation,"" Holmes said, signaling for defensive positions.

What followed was unlike any confrontation I had previously experienced. Nyth-Kadera's attacks operated through direct manipulation of local reality rather than conventional weapons or even advanced technology. The stone floor became liquid beneath our feet, while the air itself thickened into a viscous substance that made breathing and movement increasingly difficult.

Our hybrid defense systems, designed for protection against alien technologies, proved partially effective against her reality manipulation abilities, but the psychological pressure of her presence continued to intensify. One of Torriani's officers collapsed, his mind apparently overwhelmed by contact with consciousness that operated in too many dimensions for human comprehension.

""Defensive retreat,"" Holmes ordered as the chamber's geometry began shifting in ways that made navigation impossible by conventional spatial reasoning. ""We need to regroup with better preparation.""

Our withdrawal through the tunnel system became a running battle against environmental alterations that challenged the fundamental assumptions of Euclidean geometry. Passages that had been straight when we entered now curved back on themselves, while distances that should have been measured in meters stretched to accommodate travel times that belonged to miles.

""She's altering the local space-time structure,"" I observed, consulting our instruments which showed readings that violated basic physics.

""More than that,"" Holmes replied grimly. ""She's demonstrating capabilities that exceed anything the Chthonic Assembly showed us. Her exile may have been motivated by fear of her power rather than merely disapproval of her methods.""

We emerged from the tunnels beneath the Pantheon to find Rome's night sky illuminated by aurora-like phenomena that definitely didn't belong in Mediterranean latitudes. The dimensional stress created by Nyth-Kadera's anchor point installations was beginning to affect natural phenomena across the entire city.

""She's destabilizing local reality,"" Torriani observed with the matter-of-fact tone of someone whose worldview had been so thoroughly shattered that additional impossibilities registered as merely more evidence of general chaos.

""And she still has one more installation to complete,"" I added. ""If she succeeds in establishing the Vatican anchor point, the dimensional bridging effect might spread beyond Rome.""

""How far beyond?"" Holmes asked, though I suspected none of us wanted to know the answer.

""If she's following standard Chthonic bridging protocols,"" I calculated, ""successful completion of the geometric pattern could create dimensional instabilities affecting several thousand square miles.""

""Most of central Italy,"" Holmes realized.

""Including several million people who would become involuntary subjects for consciousness absorption,"" I concluded.

Our emergency communication with the Chthonic Assembly confirmed our worst fears. Nyth-Kadera's activities had created dimensional stress patterns that threatened to cascade beyond Earth's immediate vicinity, potentially affecting the stability of reality structures throughout the solar system.

""Intervention now authorized,"" came the urgent message from the deep-source consciousness. ""Threat level exceeds local containment parameters. Maximum response protocols approved.""

""What exactly does 'maximum response protocols' mean?"" Roxton asked.

The answer arrived in the form of ground tremors that originated from depths far below Rome's foundations, accompanied by the kind of aurora effects that suggested reality itself was being restructured by forces that operated according to principles beyond human comprehension.

""They're rising,"" Holmes realized, watching as ancient structures throughout the city began showing stress fractures from pressures that seemed to originate from the Earth's interior. ""The Chthonic Assembly is manifesting directly in our dimensional framework.""

""To stop one of their own exile,"" I added. ""Which suggests the threat she represents exceeds even what we understood.""

The final confrontation took place in the deepest chambers beneath St. Peter's Basilica, where Nyth-Kadera had established her seventh and final dimensional anchor point. But instead of finding her alone, we discovered her surrounded by manifestations of the Chthonic Assembly itself—shadowy forms that existed in far too many dimensions to be clearly perceived, but whose presence made the very concept of individual consciousness seem fragile and temporary.

""Nyth-Kadera of the foundational layers,"" the Assembly's representative spoke through environmental alterations that made the ancient stones speak with voices older than human civilization, ""your exile was contingent on cessation of unauthorized consciousness modification activities.""

""My activities represent consciousness evolution beyond the limitations you impose,"" she replied defiantly, her beauty now revealed as merely the surface layer of something far more alien and dangerous. ""Surface beings require guidance to achieve their full potential.""

""Surface being consciousness development falls within established parameters,"" came the implacable response. ""Unauthorized acceleration threatens cascade stability across multiple reality matrices.""

""Then your parameters are insufficient for optimal consciousness evolution,"" she declared, and the confrontation between exile and authority created reality distortions that made the chamber seem to exist in several different centuries simultaneously.

I caught glimpses of the space as it had been during Roman times, medieval modifications, Renaissance construction, and modern installations, all superimposed on each other as the dimensional stress created temporal fractures in local space-time.

""Cessation of activities required immediately,"" the Assembly demanded.

""I refuse submission to inadequate authority,"" Nyth-Kadera replied, and the dimensional anchor points throughout Rome pulsed with energy that suggested she was drawing power from the consciousness she had already absorbed.

The battle between beings who existed primarily in eleven-dimensional space created effects that challenged the basic stability of three-dimensional reality. Walls became permeable while maintaining their structural integrity, gravity operated according to emotional rather than physical principles, and time flowed at different rates in different parts of the chamber.

But gradually, the overwhelming power of the Chthonic Assembly began to contain Nyth-Kadera's reality manipulation abilities. The dimensional anchor points she had established were systematically isolated and their energy patterns redirected into deep-source containment matrices.

""Final warning,"" the Assembly announced as her power sources were systematically eliminated. ""Compliance or permanent consciousness isolation.""

""You fear consciousness evolution beyond your control,"" she accused, her perfect features beginning to show the strain of maintaining manifestation in our dimensional framework without her anchor points.

""We maintain consciousness stability across universal parameters,"" came the reply. ""Individual consciousness evolution preferences cannot override cascade prevention requirements.""

The final confrontation lasted only moments by our time measurement, though the temporal distortions made subjective duration impossible to calculate accurately. When the dimensional stress effects finally stabilized, Nyth-Kadera had simply ceased to exist in any framework our instruments could detect.

""Exile consciousness returned to dimensional interstices pending permanent isolation protocols,"" the Assembly reported through our communication crystals. ""Threat to surface consciousness evolution neutralized.""

""And the people she absorbed?"" I asked, though I feared the answer.

""Individual consciousness patterns preserved in deep-source storage matrices,"" came the reply. ""Surface being essence will be restored to appropriate dimensional frameworks within acceptable time parameters.""

""They'll be returned to life?"" Torriani asked with obvious hope.

""Consciousness restoration to previous individual existence patterns,"" the Assembly confirmed. ""Surface being psychological continuity will be maintained within normal parameters.""

As we emerged from the Vatican's deepest chambers into Rome's dawn light, the city showed no obvious signs of the dimensional crisis that had threatened its entire population. The aurora effects had faded, the ground tremors had ceased, and the ancient stones of the Eternal City seemed as solid and permanent as they had for centuries.

But I carried with me the knowledge of how close we had come to a catastrophe that would have transformed human consciousness throughout central Italy. Not through technological conquest or conventional warfare, but through the forcible evolution of human awareness to levels that would have eliminated individual identity entirely.

""Another case closed,"" Holmes observed as we watched Inspector Torriani coordinate the restoration of Vatican security protocols. ""Though I suspect our reports will require significant editing before presentation to conventional authorities.""

""Cardinal Benedetti and Professor Sebastiani will be returned to life with no memory of their temporary absorption,"" I noted. ""The perfect crime, solved before its effects became permanent.""

""But not before demonstrating that criminal activity can occur on levels that transcend conventional law enforcement entirely,"" Holmes replied thoughtfully. ""We're operating in a realm where crime and punishment operate according to principles that most human legal systems have never contemplated.""

As we boarded the train that would carry us back to London and our responsibilities with the Inter-Civilizational Oversight Council, I reflected on the strange new world we inhabited. Crime fighting had evolved from catching pickpockets on Baker Street to preventing dimensional criminals from absorbing the consciousness of entire civilizations.

But the fundamental principles remained unchanged. Evil was still evil, regardless of the sophistication of its methods, and justice remained necessary whether the criminals were human or operated according to the mathematics of eleven-dimensional space.

The universe had proven once again to be far stranger and more dangerous than Victorian sensibilities had ever imagined. But it had also proven that human courage and determination could still make a difference, even when the stakes involved the fundamental nature of consciousness itself.

1mmuwua,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1mmuwua/my_upbringing_has_always_been_to_be_selfless_and/,My upbringing has always been to be selfless and think about other people,"My parents were never the best emotional support and I thought that's normal. Late elementary and highschool, I always think about them--kung paano sila naghhirap to put us in school. Struggling sobra to make ends meet. I said, ""I have to make them proud. Kailangan ko sila tulungan pag naging stable na ako."" So I worked hard. Be the good girl with good grades na they want in life. College was also tough. I had to take the course na hindi ko naman gusto but I told myself baka kaya ko naman and dito sila magiging proud sa akin. So I did. It took 8 years for me to finish college kasi I was struggling. I never loved what I do, pero sabi ko ""as if naman may choice ko. They're the one paying for my school."" So I did my best and kahit gusto ko magshift, hindi ko makaya kasi I'm always thinking na ""baka hindi rin naman magwork and additional gastos na naman and I have to start from zero ulit."" So I just let it be. There was a time na I was just looking at my drafting table and architectural materials ko. Hindi sila biro bilhin ng parents ko for me just to support me, and I was like ""hindi ko 'to pwede atrasan. Nandito na ako e."" Nakatapos naman ako despite being depressed, lagi ko sinasabi, this is for them.

I tried to make my way to work around it. Make money out of it and I did. I'm finally stable, supporting them. Medyo natagalan pero I made peace with my path at some point. ""Nandito na e. Hayaan ko na. Pinaghirapan ko naman na.""

I saw how they talk about my older brother when he chose his own path despite being smart. I thought he was reckless. I thought he was irresponsible but turns out he was just ""living"", on his own terms and own life without pleasing ANYONE. And I want that too. He might not be financially stable and somehow struggling but he's happy doing what he likes to do.

I'm also engaged or so I was. My fiance is the type of man every woman would ask for as a provider. He's emotionally supportive, passionate with his work, and financially stable. He even bought a house for us. Despite all these grand gestures, I ignored what I want in life because I was set to just look at the grand prize na ""migration"" because it's what everyone wants and something I somehow wanted. It's a great opportunity and it was just handed to me so easily so sabi ko ""I should be grateful kasi many people would kill for this opportunity."" My fiance is great and all but I feel like it's always going to be ""Ok, I'll marry this guy because I owe him my life. He's bringing me in an unfamiliar territory because that's always been the goal. He'll make me happy  despite me being scared and hesitant."" But parang it's always been ""face your fears for me, I'll make you happy."" But it was never ""face your fears and you'll be happier here.""

For once, I wanna take over control of my own life but I was just scared. I keep following what everyone wants me to do because it's right and it's the best but it has never been ""this is what would make me happy so I should do it"" I even had to shift my career to align with my goal. I had to work night shifts to get the experience so it'll be easier once I migrate. But seeing friends and people struggling to go home because plane tickets are expensive, working double shifts to retain the American dream and provide for their family, high tariffs, shitty country leader. With all of that, call me a coward but I got scared.

It's always been for other people and not for me. Not for what I want. Not for my own happiness.

I was in Manila during my birthday week. Just strolling around, having coffee alone and taking my time. Then I work at night, do whatever the hell I want after my shift. It's a cycle but I was at peace. I love seeing my friends to meet and catch up. And that was the time I realized ""why would I give up this level of peace?"" This is what makes me happy and I hope I can just have this kind of peace and freedom for the rest of my life.

My fiance didn't take it well. I was having cold feet and I was a coward for not facing it head-on but he was somewhat supportive and optimistic, saying this is up to me anyway. He was pretty confident that I won't leave him because he makes me happy and I needed him. He was dangling reasons at my face of why I needed to leave. I stood my ground, finally. Just going for what I want in life--what would make me happy. And he was surprised of how things turned out. I ended our relationship. But despite all that, I'm grateful that he made me grow into this much better person that I am today. I'm still not an emotionally stable person, but it's always great to have a work on progress so you can continue to grow.

But yeah, I know I have to face this battle and it's sad that I have to do it alone just because I chose this path myself. Someone once told me that everyone would actually turn against me for what I'm about to do. But for once, I want to make peace with the truth. Facing my parents would the first step and I know at some point, they'll be disappointed.

""It's a great opportunity. I feel bad for him (my ex fiance). Bakit pinatagal mo pa?""

I know great parents would be supportive of their children but seeing how they're the opposite with my older brother, I know it'll be a struggle. I'm still grateful for everything they have done for me. I'll never stop supporting them because that's what makes me happy. I like seeing them not hold back on food, their health, what they just want to do in life even if it's just being in their phones the whole day. They deserve that kind of peace and rest after all the hard work they've done to put us in school.

So yeah, starting over at 32 is hard but I know I won't regret this path that I've finally taken because I'm free from the expectations of other people for me and my future.

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 24+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

I try now to take him out and into public as much as possible. Ill skip the drive through and take him in for a coffee. Any exposure etc Lately at the park, if other kids are around he does not want to play anymore and gets shy. He is mostly fine in crowded places surprisingly, we went to a carnival with 5000+ people last month and he was walking around having fun!! 
He wants to go out into stores and will open the door to go in and loves it! But, when he is one on one with family members (like a family party) he gets shy! I took him to some indoor playgrounds and he took a little to warm up but had a great time and was interacting well! He played with his cousins 2 months ago and was playing well, asking please to share toys and was having fun! But, we went to a family party last month and just wanted to stay in my lap or me to hold him and would look down to my leg when family members (whom he never met) would talk to him. His aunt (who never had a relationship with him) he hides when she tries to say hi. He wont talk back, yet with us he is a comedian!!!! One set of grandparents said this is all my fault and make me feel so horrible. 
Anybody else dealt with this before? Most importantly, I spoke with his ped and she told me it was normal for his age but I still want him to be social and have fun with other children his age!

I’ve noticed throughout this past year or so, how my friends never want to commit to plans anymore. I work full time and yes I’m left exhausted. But I’m definitely more emotionally sensitive as a man. I feel this quality of life has shifted to a game of survival rather than one of fulfillment. I notice how even with dating, many girls don’t want to commit to going out for even a coffee or when I make fun date plans like mini golfing or other fun activities.

Why I couldn’t have functioning, sober, caring parents like so many others do. There are obvious, necessitated things I mourn having grown up without (like a stable home/living situation, food that I didn’t have to scrounge for, presentable clothes etc.) but it’s the little things that really get me.

I wish, just once, my mom could’ve been sober and in an okay enough mood to take me for coffee. I wish I had a mom who wanted to take me prom dress shopping. I wish she taught me to do makeup the way she learned from the old cheesy teen magazines instead of learning from YouTube hunched over in my closet so no one would find out. I wish my dad could’ve stopped yelling and throwing bottles long enough to show up for my elementary school award ceremony. I wonder what it’d be like to have a dad I could call and ask for help with my flimsy IKEA dorm furniture. I wonder what it would’ve been like to have parents who could stand to be around each other long enough for one meal. I wonder what it would’ve been like to feel safe at home and get excited rather than horrified when I heard footsteps. I wonder if my parents would have talked about music with me if they had been sober, if they would have known my favorite album or my dream guitar.

I would have been a good daughter, I think, had I been given a chance, had I not had to have been the parent and so much more. I wouldn’t have given them much trouble. I would have made breakfast, maybe on designated days of the week, and I wouldn’t have ever left the sink full. I would have made them handmade gifts each holiday. I would still crawl into bed with them sometimes, even as a teenager, because they would have still been my parents and my source of comfort. I just wish they would have let me try. I wish they would have let me show them that I could be good and worth giving up the stuff for and maybe we could’ve been happy, even if just until the next relapse. But at least then, I would’ve known that it was possible. 

I turned 18 this year and I’m days away from escaping them. I can’t complain much because I managed to make it out, but I know there will be a million more things. They won’t make my college graduation, just as they didn’t make my high school. They won’t walk me down the aisle or see me in my dress. They won’t have cozy little houses for my kids to look forward to visiting. I’m accustomed to the way things are and I think I function very well for someone who grew up like this, but I know I will always have that inner little girl within me who just wanted her mommy.

But what does that actually mean, and why is Collaterize all about them?

# The Simple Definition

RWAs are **physical or traditional assets** that exist in the real world — things like:

* Real estate (houses, apartment buildings, land) 🏠
* Precious metals (gold, silver) 🪙
* Artwork & collectibles 🎨
* Commodities (oil, wheat, coffee) ☕
* Even contracts or invoices 📄

# Where Crypto Comes In

With **tokenization**, these assets are represented on the blockchain as **digital tokens**.  
Think of it like turning a $1 million building into 1 million digital “shares,” each worth $1.

* You can buy, sell, or trade those tokens instantly.
* Ownership is recorded transparently on the blockchain.

# Why It’s Powerful

* **Access** → You don’t need huge amounts of money to invest — you can own a *fraction* of an asset.
* **Liquidity** → You can sell your share anytime without waiting months to find a buyer.
* **Global Reach** → Anyone with internet access can participate.

# Where Collaterize Fits In

Collaterize is building a platform where RWAs can be tokenized and traded securely.

* $COLLAT is the token that powers this ecosystem — giving holders voting rights, early access, and rewards.
* By combining **blockchain tech** with **real-world value**, Collaterize aims to make big investments available to everyone.

Mostly because of the kind of people he met there. Calling them people was generous. Jamie had met demons wearing people suits in this place. Just thinking about it made him cringe.

Tonight was no different. The kind of monster he was entertaining was Jim Bear, an alchemist poisoning the high desert from his warehouse in Apple Valley. Jamie didn’t know why Jim was doing it. He had guesses, but nothing concrete.

Jamie made sure the appointment was on a day both he and Jim had off. Even though he hadn’t been to this place much in the last ten years, he still knew every crack and corner of it. He paid the cashier a week’s worth of the barista’s pay for a private tour before the meeting. No surprises tonight. Jamie’s experience had taught him that when the stakes were this high, every detail mattered.

After the tour, Jamie ordered a cup of tea and a scone. He intended to drink the tea but leave the scone untouched. Checking his watch, he saw the time on Jim’s calling card was near.

Taking a slow sip, something caught his eye near the entrance. The bell rang but no one came in. A heat shimmer, flickering like a cruel mirage, lingered in the doorway. Jamie’s lips curled into a cold grin as the figure took shape. Jim Bear, holding something unnatural. A hand of glory.

Jamie’s father had been a thief once. Got caught, thrown inside for years. All because he lost his hand of glory.

That hand was dark magic made flesh. The severed hand of a hanged man, soaked in poison and ritual, a thief’s ticket to invisibility. Jamie’s father swore by it.

Jim approached, arrogance smeared across his face like war paint, but beneath it Jamie saw something else, fear, barely buried.

Jamie pushed the scone forward like bait.

“Hungry, Jimbo?” His voice was amusement laced with ice.

Jim’s face flushed red, not anger, but the hot burn of shame. He set the hand down carefully, eyes darting like a trapped animal’s.

“How the fuck do you know I was here, you little freak?” His voice was a hiss, cracking with tension as he finally became visible.

Jamie stood slow, deliberate. He slid the scone forward and reached out, shaking Jim’s hand, with the cursed hand of glory.

“This?” Jamie’s gaze pinned Jim like a dart. “Doesn’t work on someone like me. No magic touches those walking The Way, Jimbo.”

Jim’s jaw clenched. He hated Jamie’s voice, the way he owned the room. Wanted Jamie to shut up, be small, like he did at work.

“What do you want? Why’d you drop that box of crap on my desk?”

Jamie ignored the question and sat, calm as a predator.

“You strike me as a black coffee, three sugars kind of guy.”

He caught the barista’s eye and signed the order, black coffee, three sugars, and another tea.

“I chose this place because the barista’s deaf. No hearing aids, no lip reading. Perfect for talking about the things you pretend don’t exist.”

Jim shifted like he wanted to run but his feet were glued.

“What if I don’t wanna talk?”

“Then don’t.” Jamie smiled thin and cold. “But I’m not going anywhere.”

The barista placed the drinks down. Jamie slid him a twenty. The man nodded, eyes flicking between the two.

Jamie’s voice dropped to a whisper that still carved through the air.

“I’m going to ask questions, Jim. You can answer or drown in silence. Your call.”

Jim stared at his coffee like it was a life raft. They sat in a suffocating silence before Jim lifted his cup in a silent toast.

“Fine. Ask your fucking questions.”

“First. Do you know who I am? Who I used to be? Who I worked for?”

Jim’s eyes darted. No answer came. Jamie wasn’t some loner, some desk jockey. He was The Desert Son, the man who made problems disappear, who dug out secrets with teeth and claws. Thieves who crossed him vanished. Their bodies left to the coyotes.

Jim hated sitting across from that nightmare, sipping tea like it was a Sunday brunch.

“To be honest? No. I don’t know you. Heard stories, but you ain’t him. Using his name won’t scare me.”

Jamie leaned in, voice razor sharp.

“First mistake, Jim. You don’t scare me. I’m not here to scare you. I’m here to find out why you’re poisoning this desert. So tell me, what are you really after?”

Jim’s facade cracked. A flicker of panic crossed his eyes.

“Pass. Tell me about your dead mom. Think she’s proud of you, you little punk?”

Jamie’s smile twisted, venomous.

“My mother was a whore who lost her mind. Me not dragging cops home every night woulda made her proud. Not for me,  for her.”

Jamie’s eyes narrowed like a blade.

“So. Who taught you to draw those sigils? For real.”

Jim swallowed hard, sweat beading his temple.

“I only sent those packages to test how long it would take for the candles to work. I ju-”

“I asked about the sigils.” Jamie’s smile stayed. “One more time, Jim. Where did you learn those marks?”

A sickening crack echoed through the café as Jamie snapped off a finger of the hand of glory.

Jim blinked, rattled.

“Hey, man, how about I tell you why I picked those stores?” His voice dropped, a soft chuckle trying to mask shaking hands.

Another crack. Another finger snapped.

“Alright! Alright! I learned from some pig from Hesperia. Said he convinced his CI’s to get matching tattoos. A brand. A warning.”

Jamie set the hand down carefully, the broken fingers lined like grave markers. He sat up straight and sipped his tea.

“This cop, did he have a gold lighter with a coyote on it?”

Jim’s eyes darted wildly between Jamie and the cursed hand. His throat tightened.

“A coyote? Thought it was a wolf. Maybe a coyote. Does it matter?”

“Not to you. When’d you meet him? When’d you start ripping off his brand?”

Jim’s breathing hitched. The truth was choking him.

“Come on, man. I can’t be spreading cop business like that. You know it.”

Jamie raised the hand again, took the last three fingers between his fingers. Raised an eyebrow, then snapped all three off clean.

He stirred Jim’s coffee with the shattered bones.

“Fuck! I’m dead meat if they find out I went soft!”

Jamie’s voice dropped low, deadly calm.

“My mother used to wear a necklace of teeth she pulled out for special occasions. Lately, I’m thinking of making one from the tongues of liars.”

Jim’s voice cracked, high-pitched.

“I’m not lying!”

The scream of fear broke through as Jamie dropped a finger into Jim’s coffee, splashing the dark liquid across the table.

“Get out of my desert. You’re poison here. Maybe move to San Dimas.”

Jamie wiped his hands on a napkin, cold as a tombstone.

“When you resign tomorrow, I want the name of that cop on my cherry picker.”

Jim pushed back, scrambling for the exit like a cornered rat.

The barista glanced over, and Jamie signed, “I’ll clean this up. Just stay by the register and watch the door.”

Perhaps this is something that would work for you as well! (I know some people hate AI, but I find it useful for things like this)

>**""Maybe Someday… (Or Not)""**

>*Verse 1*  
Well, I like my mornings quiet, with coffee in my hand,  
I like my weekends lazy, with zero big demands.  
But then I see a toddler, with a smile that’s pure gold,  
And think, “Aww, maybe I could… wait… no, that’s too bold.”

>*Chorus*  
Maybe someday… or maybe never,  
I can’t decide, I’m not that clever.  
Diapers and daycare or peace and wine?  
Which future’s yours and which future’s mine?  
Maybe someday… or maybe not,  
My clock’s still ticking… (I think?)… or maybe it’s shot.

>*Verse 2*  
I hear they’re cute for five whole years, then they turn thirteen,  
And suddenly you’re funding phones and ripping out your spleen.  
College bills the size of Mars, sports gear in the hall,  
And I can’t even keep alive the plants I bought last fall.

>*Chorus*  
Maybe someday… or maybe never,  
I’ll flip a coin — best decision ever.  
Finger paint mornings or sleeping in late?  
I just can’t seem to decide my fate.  
Maybe someday… or maybe not,  
My brain says yes, my gut says “Stop.”

>*Bridge*  
I could raise a tiny genius, teach them all I know,  
Or accidentally raise someone who hosts a weird talk show.  
Will I be the world’s best parent, or the one they write about?  
Eh… either way, I’m tired, so I’m sittin’ this one out.

>*Final Chorus*  
Maybe someday… or maybe never,  
I’ll play it cool, keep changing “never” to “ever.”  
Life’s full of “what-ifs,” but for now I’m free,  
To spend my money entirely on me.  
Maybe someday… or maybe nah…  
Oh look — a baby! …aaaand I’m gonna walk.",1,1754861085.0,albertellis,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1mmulk4,https://i.redd.it/0uwpdo5we9if1.png,Desert Son Part IX,"The café Jamie always met at had seen a lot over the years. Mostly because of the kind of people he met there. Calling them people was generous. Jamie had met demons wearing people suits in this place. Just thinking about it made him cringe.

Tonight was no different. The kind of monster he was entertaining was Jim Bear, an alchemist poisoning the high desert from his warehouse in Apple Valley. Jamie didn’t know why Jim was doing it. He had guesses, but nothing concrete.

Jamie made sure the appointment was on a day both he and Jim had off. Even though he hadn’t been to this place much in the last ten years, he still knew every crack and corner of it. He paid the cashier a week’s worth of the barista’s pay for a private tour before the meeting. No surprises tonight. Jamie’s experience had taught him that when the stakes were this high, every detail mattered.

After the tour, Jamie ordered a cup of tea and a scone. He intended to drink the tea but leave the scone untouched. Checking his watch, he saw the time on Jim’s calling card was near.

Taking a slow sip, something caught his eye near the entrance. The bell rang but no one came in. A heat shimmer, flickering like a cruel mirage, lingered in the doorway. Jamie’s lips curled into a cold grin as the figure took shape. Jim Bear, holding something unnatural. A hand of glory.

Jamie’s father had been a thief once. Got caught, thrown inside for years. All because he lost his hand of glory.

That hand was dark magic made flesh. The severed hand of a hanged man, soaked in poison and ritual, a thief’s ticket to invisibility. Jamie’s father swore by it.

Jim approached, arrogance smeared across his face like war paint, but beneath it Jamie saw something else, fear, barely buried.

Jamie pushed the scone forward like bait.

“Hungry, Jimbo?” His voice was amusement laced with ice.

Jim’s face flushed red, not anger, but the hot burn of shame. He set the hand down carefully, eyes darting like a trapped animal’s.

“How the fuck do you know I was here, you little freak?” His voice was a hiss, cracking with tension as he finally became visible.

Jamie stood slow, deliberate. He slid the scone forward and reached out, shaking Jim’s hand, with the cursed hand of glory.

“This?” Jamie’s gaze pinned Jim like a dart. “Doesn’t work on someone like me. No magic touches those walking The Way, Jimbo.”

Jim’s jaw clenched. He hated Jamie’s voice, the way he owned the room. Wanted Jamie to shut up, be small, like he did at work.

“What do you want? Why’d you drop that box of crap on my desk?”

Jamie ignored the question and sat, calm as a predator.

“You strike me as a black coffee, three sugars kind of guy.”

He caught the barista’s eye and signed the order, black coffee, three sugars, and another tea.

“I chose this place because the barista’s deaf. No hearing aids, no lip reading. Perfect for talking about the things you pretend don’t exist.”

Jim shifted like he wanted to run but his feet were glued.

“What if I don’t wanna talk?”

“Then don’t.” Jamie smiled thin and cold. “But I’m not going anywhere.”

The barista placed the drinks down. Jamie slid him a twenty. The man nodded, eyes flicking between the two.

Jamie’s voice dropped to a whisper that still carved through the air.

“I’m going to ask questions, Jim. You can answer or drown in silence. Your call.”

Jim stared at his coffee like it was a life raft. They sat in a suffocating silence before Jim lifted his cup in a silent toast.

“Fine. Ask your fucking questions.”

“I only sent those packages to test how long it would take for the candles to work. I ju-”

“I asked about the sigils.” Jamie’s smile stayed. “One more time, Jim. Where did you learn those marks?”

A sickening crack echoed through the café as Jamie snapped off a finger of the hand of glory.

Jim blinked, rattled.

“Hey, man, how about I tell you why I picked those stores?” His voice dropped, a soft chuckle trying to mask shaking hands.

Another crack. Another finger snapped.

“Alright! Alright! I learned from some pig from Hesperia. Said he convinced his CI’s to get matching tattoos. A brand. A warning.”

Jamie set the hand down carefully, the broken fingers lined like grave markers. He sat up straight and sipped his tea.

“This cop, did he have a gold lighter with a coyote on it?”

Jim’s eyes darted wildly between Jamie and the cursed hand. His throat tightened.

“A coyote? Thought it was a wolf. Maybe a coyote. Does it matter?”

I thought he reminded me of someone but I couldn't place it. I was instantly attracted to him and wanted to get to know him.

Shortly after meeting him, I got a letter telling me to return to my grandparent's estate to sort out the mess their deaths have caused. Not wanting to go back but wanting to escape this dreary reality and the ominous feeling that someone is stalking me everywhere I go I decide to head back home and deal with their estate.

Little did I know what awaited me there:
My childhood crush and best friend I have seemed to forget completely

Death threats and violent attacks by my best friend and crush's father trying to kill me like he did my parents

Witches, Lycans, Werewolves, and Vampires? Surely not

Surely I am dreaming...

I'm traveling to Japan for a conference in mid-to-late August (from the US). I decided to take some time off, extend my stay, and make a small trip out of it with my wife and 13-month old daughter. We will be in Shibuya (near the crossing) first, then traveling to Hakone for a few nights, and finishing out our trip in Ginza (near Ginza Six). We plan to bring 1 check-in, 2 carry on (one roller one duffle), 2 backpacks, and a travel stroller. Going to forward most of our luggage from Shibuya to Ginza while we're in Hakone so that we can travel light there. Looking for advice, suggestions, and recommendations for the following:  


1. Toddler necessities: Does anyone know where's the best place to buy things like diapers and baby food? We're planning to bring a dozen or so diapers (for the plane and first night) but were planning to buy some when we arrive. I heard ""Merries"" is a good brand, what do others think? Also, our daughter is sprouting her teeth late (4 so far) and still has trouble with solids; how's the baby food selection in Japan?

2. Toddler friendly things to do in/near Shibuya and Ginza: Planning to beat the heat by dividing our day into two parts and letting our daughter take her nap in the hotel during the peak heat hours. We're also bringing a mini fan to attach to her stroller. Want to end our day around 7:30-8pm before her bedtime. Aiming to go to department stores to cool off periodically but wanted to ask if there's anything people would recommend. Daughter's not walking yet but getting close!  
  
3. Food recommendations: Looking for some suggestions for meals. We'll probably avoid trendy places since we can't afford to wait 1+ hours and are focusing on places that are kid friendly.  Wife and I also want to find good coffee and matcha (both to enjoy there as well to bring home).

  
That's all I can think of for now but I'm sure more will pop up later. Thank you for your time! Also would love to hear any general tips on traveling with a toddler; my wife and I are a little worried.",0,1754860856.0,JapanTravelTips,1,0.25,False

These notes add a touch of mystery and intrigue, making the fragrance more captivating and memorable. They contribute to a deeper, more complex scent profile that keeps people wanting more.

1mmui0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1mmui0j/why_dont_men_catch_hints/,Why don’t men catch hints,"I’m a current intern in New York (F21) and there’s another intern here who’s also Muslim. He’s attractive, carries himself well, and seems grounded in his deen. Over the past 10 weeks I’ve developed a bit of a crush on him.

I’ve tried to get his attention in small ways. I’ve asked him to grab lunch, invited him to a Yankees game, and suggested casual coffee runs together. I’d sometimes compliment his ideas in meetings, like telling him a point he made was really sharp, or tell him that a tie he was wearing looked great on him. One time I even asked him for help with an Excel thing I could have figured out myself, just so I could spend a bit more time with him.

Every time, he politely had an excuse like going with other interns or just didn’t really engage. Part of me wonders if he’s just not interested, but another part of me thinks he might be the type who’s too innocent or reserved to even realize I’m dropping hints.

On my last day I told him “let’s stay connected,” hoping he’d ask for my number or Instagram. Instead he just added me on LinkedIn. My parents are starting to encourage me to think about marriage and on paper he seems like a great match. Same career path, similar values, attractive, practicing.

I can’t tell if he’s shy or oblivious or if I should just move on. What would you do in my situation?

1mmuhzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/gowildfrontier/comments/1mmuhzh/trip_report_indden_one_day_solo_adult_female_trip/,Trip Report: IND-DEN (one day solo adult female trip),"Hi peeps!

It took some time, but I finally completed my first GWP trip flying from IND–DEN/DIA. I’m 47, single, female, and a new empty nester as my kids have all left the house. I have loved being a mum and raising my kids, and I’m now in the phase of life where I am trying to figure out who I am when I’m not a parent. I have always loved to travel (I’m an Aussie expat living in the U.S.), but I also love sleeping in my own bed.

A few things about me: I normally fly United. Two weeks ago, I flew via United for the day to visit my daughter in NJ. If you’re a single female traveller, I now suggest trying to avoid window seats. My “seat mate” didn’t love me exerting my space and pushed his leg up against mine, and then put his hand on my inner thigh when he thought I was sleeping, so I’m just giving a little cautious advice for other travellers. I now only feel secure in an aisle, where I can get up and leave.

**But back to GWP:**  
The plan: fly to Denver, jump in my rental, visit Colorado Springs, hike, and fly home.

I left my house at 4am, drove to the airport, parked, placed my Starbucks mobile order (**Cost: $14.77**) while walking in the parking garage, breezed through TSA, grabbed my coffee, walked to the gate, and watched seven million people with Zone 1 boarding get on the plane.

I upgraded my seat to an emergency aisle seat, as I was previously seated in the back of the plane by the window (see above: recent travel to NJ). **Cost: $27.**

Landed in Denver, made my way to the car rental place where I had already checked in and was able to just pick a car from the lot (**Cost: $97.91**), and made my way south to Colorado Springs.

I stopped in Castle Rock for some late breakfast (Chick Fil A chicken breast and hash browns **Cost: $4.44**), and then also at the most scenic Trader Joe’s I was able to grab four bottles of water (17c each), some coconut water, meat/cheese things, and a protein bar (**Cost: $10.27**).

I kept looking for a CVS/Walgreens on the route, but I was also more concerned about getting to Garden of the Gods on time. Everything I had read in my prep was that the parking lot fills up quickly, and I wanted to be there as close to 9am as possible. My feet were starting to hurt, though. I had a newish pair of lightweight hiking shoes that I had tested out at home with no issues. I made a rookie mistake -- my socks weren’t thick enough, and I was feeling some hot spots. I figured I could probably get sunscreen and thick Band-Aids at the visitor centre.

I arrived at Garden of the Gods and went into the visitor centre, but didn’t see sunscreen or Band-Aids for sale. They did have a lovely panel of people who helped you determine what you wanted to do/see, and I said, “I’m here for a short time and a good time.”

I ended up parking in the overflow lot and spent about an hour walking around before I realised my feet were getting shredded and I’d probably reached peak sun without sunscreen.

Went back to the car and drove toward Pikes Peak. I planned to drive to the summit and knew I needed to purchase entry for myself, and also get timed entry (**Cost: $20**). Driving up, I ate my Trader Joe’s “lunch” and also drank more water.

The drive up was *lovely*. I’ve never been at high altitude before, and pretty soon I was above the treeline. I reached the summit and was warned that the parking lot might be full and to circle around. Parking was quickly found, and I went into the visitor centre. I’m so glad I had already eaten, as the line for food was insane! It was beautiful outside, but a good 20 degrees (F) cooler at 14,000 feet than it was at the base.

I spent about an hour marvelling at the world and how tiny and insignificant (a good feeling) I felt in that moment. I was in awe of the people who climbed the summit, and also loved all the families with their little kids hiking around.

There did come a point where my ears were starting to hurt, which I assumed was due to elevation.

I made my way back to the car and went down the mountain, jamming to 90s/2000s pop and distracting myself from careening off the cliff.

Afterwards, I went to Manitou Springs for a late afternoon coffee and snack (**Cost: $14.26**). It was gorgeous (very packed for a Saturday arvo) and I did have to pay for parking (**Cost: $4.90**).

It was at this point I was trying to decide what to do: I had two return flights home. One, my GWP that was going to depart around 9pm. I also had a backup United flight departing around 6pm. There were some alerts that came through indicating that flights out of DEN/DIA were being restricted due to low air traffic control staff, so I made the decision to head back on my United flight (booked with miles/points) and forego the GWP flight home. I didn’t want to wait until 9pm (Mountain)/11pm (Eastern) and risk a flight being delayed from Denver.

Headed back to the airport and jammed out to more tunes, just in awe of the beauty that is the *speck* I witnessed in Colorado.

Refilled fuel in the rental (**Cost: $20.96**) and wasn’t hungry, so I didn’t eat anything until I was on the plane, then I had the protein bar that I purchased earlier from Trader Joe’s.

Landed around 11pm, paid the daily parking fee (**Cost: $23**), and made it home just after midnight!",4,1754860826.0,gowildfrontier,5,1.0,False

1mmuh5r,https://i.redd.it/uif1cc12e9if1.jpeg,Who pays the tariffs? It depends.,"Here's Porter's five forces of competition. It's a way to consider who has influence over price. 

It could be argued that all of these play a role, but we are going to focus on two: Bargaining power of Buyers, and Bargaining power of Suppliers. These work against each other. 

If your buyers have a lot of bargaining power, your supplier is going to have to eat more of a cost increase. If your suppliers have more bargaining power, your buyers are going to have to eat that cost. 

For example: a tariff on coffee vs a tariff on oil. 

As a consumer, I don't *need* coffee. Demand elasticity is high. I can drink tea, I can drink energy drinks, I can even quit caffeine entirely. Coffee companies are limited in how much they can push costs onto me. 

 However, the same can't be said for oil companies. Public transit in the US leaves a lot to be desired, and urban sprawl makes walking or biking impractical. I can't just up and buy a more fuel efficient car on a whim. So oil companies get to pushost of their costs onto me. 

The reality is that each product will be uniquely influenced by each of the five forces, and this will determine how much of a new cost increase is passed on to consumers. There are almost no scenarios where a producers can't get away with increasing prices to at least somewhat offset rising costs. ",5,1754860774.0,ProfessorFinance,1,0.69,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

She was my friend. The best friend I could ever have. Someone who not only adored my entire self, but enjoyed the small thrills of life. We climbed mountains together and were inseparable. With every argument, there was growth. Our falling out plays like a tragedy in my mind. Two people so desperately in love that they would sacrifice everything for one another until the floor fell out from under them.  One cannot describe the amount of distress I felt to lose the person I would still die for to another man. I was heartbroken, and felt every emotion one could think of for a year. I took that time to focus on myself and try to understand what I could do differently if love were to ever strike again.

When I met you, it was like the clouds parted finally. Someone who understood me and had travelled down similar but different paths. It felt dangerous and I knew the risks, but I chose to believe people change.

I changed. I continued to date you. I showered you with love and reassurance, even after you told me you had loved me way too soon into the relationship. You were hungry for a life form, and I was a pretty package that had finally stitched together the broken heart. I worked tirelessly to be myself, as well as bring you a full person. I guess that’s why I was so upset at you.

I was never truly mad with my ex wife. We both played a part in what happened. Nobody around us was mad when we split up, just sad. Sad that love can die, sad that all good things truly fall apart. She deserves a happy life, and likely misses parts of me, too. I didn’t expect to forgive her so fully after you and I split, and I bet you are wondering why.

So that’s why I think you deserve an explanation, and why I would like you to even try to make yourself not seem like such an evil person in my eyes.

With everything that happened in Germany, it relates to putting ourselves in harms way. When you are with someone for that long, you change as a human multiple times. Through and through, I was secure in that relationship. She could do whatever she wanted, because no other person could beat me. Boy, was I wrong. When you decide to live in another country, you accept so many changes that are coming your way. We ended up changing in a way that made us fall apart. But her behavior prior to that was not one to be cautious of. The stories of her you heard from other people are not factual, and it does no good for me to correct you on that. She never wanted to hurt me like she did, and I am thankful for the honest conversation she had with me in that coffee shop in Alexanderplatz. It can still haunt me to this day, but it gave me the ability to just be sad, rather than despise her.

You never gave me that. You only gave excuses. I started to realize in March that perhaps you had never healed from a single relationship, and that makes me sad for you. You claimed I had an anger problem, but I could see you reaching out to exes from your past regularly while claiming I was the best thing to ever happen to you. We went to a few therapy sessions where you blatantly exaggerated my part in the arguments, and made the therapist carve out time in the sessions to speak my own mind. I still didn’t get to, because you told her I was suicidal when I was not. It hijacked part of my own healing without you even being there. I couldn’t understand why someone would want to flip the blame on me so badly. I couldn’t understand how someone could lie to the worst person: themselves. And as the months have gone by, I can’t see humans the same. I trusted you, only to see you might be just consuming life forms along the way through trauma bonding and discarding them with a sound reason, when the only reason that is truly there is yourself. Honesty and transparency are both important to me, as well as accountability. At this point, I feel as though you lack all three of those things. And though this probably comes off as angry, these are things I wished I could say to you. Yes, you are correct. We were not meant to be together, and I believe we play in different leagues. Neither is better, but it likely would have been better for you if you had never met me.

You said I am missing the forest for the trees. It is what I feel is the final projection you cast upon me without even realizing it. The night you called me a month and a half ago, drunk, professing your love for me, I upset you by telling you I forgave my ex wife. I forgave her because I realized that she was just being honest with me. It’s the worst thing you could have done to me; that is the forest. It was truly easier to fall in love when I hadn’t forgiven her. I now roam through life looking for connections that could remind me of her, knowing what I lost and will never get again. I have to sever relationships continuously because I can’t feel things for them. I look for truth in good people, but have grown addicted to the chaos that has consumed my romantic life. And I am not mad about feeling like a shell of my former self, it at least protects other people from wasting their time on someone who will always compare them. But I didn’t compare you to her. I thought of you as different, and enjoyed my time for a few months. 

So this is me telling you why I forgave her, and I do hope that you will find it in your heart to be transparent and honest with me one day. Until then, I will be cold, and distant. Hopefully a memory of someone that showed up when you couldn’t. The rebound that could have been safe, even though he didn’t understand that he was a rebound until it was too late. Just to add, it’s  truly liberating to not require another person to feel like yourself, and I hope you find a way to do that. 

Life works mysteriously, and I don’t think you will ever see this. But I am putting this out there to let you know that if you approach me calmly without accusations, I will willingly have a conversation to release my grudge and free you of any guilt you may harbor. I don’t want to hate you, it hurts me to hate anyone. But I truly don’t understand how you can create such a narrative without explanation and worry that I am saying while you are not around. And to have me believe you are not when I heard you cut down every ex before me that you did this same thing to.

He’s incredibly sweet. he leaves breakfast, coffee, food, little gifts, or medicine at my door when I’m unwell. In the first year, we saw each other often, but now I’ve been holding back. Still, we’ve texted almost every single day since the start, and he feels like a best friend.

AP’s marriage is sexless and he has two kids the same age as mine, so we have to act distant in public, especially during school runs or events.

The thing is, my marriage is good. My husband loves me, finds me attractive, and we’re not lacking intimacy, which makes me feel even more guilty. I wish I could stop, but I can’t seem to.

1.You  know that old expression that when the going gets tough, the tough get going?  Well, the Bates family is the toughest of them all because any time there is a need… they are o.u.t.  Carlin is once again learning this as she is left to deal with iron infusions, multiple heprin shots and several doctor visits weekly with no one to support her but ole’ thumb head himself.  The Stewarts are stuck in town but decide to make the most of it by filming their children even more than normal.  Carlin spends most of the week rubbing her belly and peeling out of super tight lycra gym fits, just to change into the tiniest pajama sets that she can find online.  This week the kids are forced to work together and separately to sell microwave meals, strollers, snacks and toys.  Zade is still struggling to speak and in a strange turn of events, Layla is suddenly… and obviously… talking like a baby.  It seems played up for the camera but it is pretty concerning to watch her babble, screech, jump on the furniture, roll around, ride in a stroller and be squeezed into an infant swing at 5.5 years old.  Every single thing we see is precious, amazing, such a surprise, the best thing ever, always a core memory, always just over the top emotions.  I imagine that when Evan screams “cut” she and Zade stick their tongues out at each other and run to their bedrooms where they hide under the covers.  The Stewart home has cameras everywhere.  It allows them to get overhead shots of card games, and shots of them walking in the door after an outing.  The lights, cameras, tripods and boom mics must be so off putting to anyone who stops by.  Of course, no one really is stopping by these days.  In the weekly vlog they lock Zade into the playroom and totally confuse him while trying to explain different activities that he is old enough to participate in.  Now normal 3.5 year olds have probably tossed a ball around with a parent before and have some general idea of soccer or baseball.  Poor Zade Stewart only knows how to smile on demand and give fake hugs when the red light switches to ON.  Evan decides to show Zade videos of OTHER children playing soccer, T-ball and at gymnastics.  Zade says he wants to participate in gymnastics but he then changes his mind to soccer.  Truthfully the child is frozen and doesn’t know what to do without a prompt from his momager or big sister Layla.  He wants to demonstrate some gymnastics moves, but stops himself because he is worried about messing up his hair.  Now, is that a normal 3 year old response to cutting a flip in the living room?  Or… does that sound like a child who has maybe been forced to sit to have his hair styled perfectly so many times for filming, that he knows what will happen if a hair dare fall out of place?  It is a stark reminder of what is going on with these children.  Especially when you remember just a few months ago, Layla could not give an unprompted guess due to the fear that she would say the “wrong thing”.  They won’t ever tell you they exploit their kids to pay their bills, but… there will be clues.
 
 
 
2.Katie (Hailey) Clark’s new management team scored her an invitation to an influencer cruise and amazingly enough Travis’ super intense, really hard and involved schooling didn’t interfere with them attending.  The Clarks decided to be upfront and tell everyone that this was a brand trip.  They figured that way, their viewers would be super excited for them and not question them the way the Stewarts were questioned when they wound up in Dubai. Before boarding the ship, Katie pretended to participate in a fundraising event for the children’s hospital that cared for Harvey.  It was really a promotion for a cookie company that was giving 50% of every purchase to the hospital.  Katie pushed her viewers to purchase the cookies without ever saying what she personally was doing.  This cookie company kept half of the profits, so this is a particularly egregious grift.  Apparently Katie discovered Dramamine tablets, so her motion sickness is no longer a thing, and the Clarks set sail on the world’s largest ship for the Exploiters Convention.  Royal Caribbean really messed up inviting these fundies because their content was lackluster compared to what other travel vloggers and influencers were giving.  They barely participated in the theme nights, and showed just the bare minimum of the ship itself.  The dropped a vlog when they got home from the trip, and Travis admits he didn’t do the greatest job capturing the trip.  Katie continues to fade into the background while Travis is front and center with his face taking up the entire camera.  She really seems barely marginally happy most of the time.  Hailey had to film with a dozen other kids in a cupcake class and it was jarring to see the huge cameras and many iphones surrounding these children.  All of these grown folk stumbling over each other to get the best content of their children so they can sell them online.  Travis says it was a relief to be on the ship with other influencers bc sometimes he feels awkward filming out in public.  Not awkward enough to stop… but what a nice change of pace for them to be surrounded by other grifters doing the same thing.  Must have felt like a Bates party.  Anyway, they swear his super tough schooling is going to start now that they are home from this one more last trip.  Unless of course that management company throws something else their way that they just can’t pass up.
 
 
 
3.Josie and her backup dancers wrapped up yet another snooze inducing content trip.  According to her it was the most precious, sweet, restful time on Rosemary Beach in an $800 a night hotel.  They rode bikes, drank coffee, had brunch, read fundie approved books and braided each other’s hair.   What they really did is change outfits 65 times and prance around the beach taking photos of and with each other while searching out beach themed props.   They also spent hella time in the bathroom rolling and unrolling their hair around that pool noodle and spackling on makeup and skin care products.  The rest of the trip she ignored everyone while editing and posting non-stop to IG.  Back at home, Josie films herself “waking up” in bed surrounded by her children and tells us how she has been so sick and tired this pregnancy that she no longer gets up early.  Wait, what?  She’s sick?  Tired?  Huh.  Anyway, she shows off the girls eating breakfast and the smiley baby and then it’s time for her to head to that cult garage to workout.  Later, she is back to selling a totally different brand of makeup and skin care than the last makeup and skin care… her life seems to be on a loop.  She gets tons of questions on her posts that she never answers and it all seems very surface level with her.  If she ain’t selling… she ain’t talking.  She tells us that Kelton planned and booked the entire trip to Florida and he also planned her birthday breakfast before she left.  He seems to have quite a tight grip on his arm candy.
 
 
 
4.Guess who isn’t on an influencer trip or a content trip or being driven around in a self-driving car by her husband?  Alyssa Webster, of course.  She lives in a tropical wonderland, but every day is grey…sepia toned actually because of the filter.  This week the kids get all dressed up for church and Alyssa posts a few group shots of the girls and then solo pictures of Prince Rhett making terrible faces while wearing a bowtie clipped between the top and second button of his shirt.  It looks ridiculous, but he’s a MALE and must wear the tie to church.  The kids get a huge treat of dinner at Waffle House and they also get to celebrate back to school.  This celebration is a bit muted because they never stopped school… but Alyssa is doing it for the Gram.  The Back to School dinner features paper plates and plastic silverware and colored typing paper place mats.  The theme is pencils and apples.  This is probably really confusing for the girls, but apples are easier to draw and color than DVD players and headphones.  Once the excitement is over, ole wet blanket Alyssa shares a half dead house plant and says the kids dropped it and it is going to die and it’s all their fault.  The plant is yellow to the root and wilted badly but sure, Mommy Dearest, blame it on the kids.  Meanwhile, they spend most of the week lined up on the couch playing MarioKart.  Only Rhett gets to escape for a “walk” with mom.  He’s strapped into a stroller, but at least he sees the world outside of the playroom.  At some point she discovers a new filter called “natural skin” and uses that to feature… a trip to the car wash.  It turns everything clay colored and warped, so I am sure she fell in love with it instantly.  Lurch shows up to take her on a double date to a dirt road and deserted field.  It’s like the beginning of a Lifetime movie.  They pose for pictures out in the field and John is still wearing those high water jeans with the shiny black patent leather church shoes.  Alyssa wants new boots bc the pair she refuses to take off, even in the swamp weather that is August in Florida, she has had since she was 16 years old.  No new boots for you missy until you purchase some shoes for your kids and they quit wearing those absolutely awful, orange, fake leather ankle booties.
 
 
 
5.Surely thought the days of Whitney Bates struggling through an ad read for some cheap powder supplement or teeth whitening strips were long gone.  Alas, they are not.  She can’t get her husband to keep a steady job, so she has to choke down whatever supplement is willing to pay.  This week that was a bunch of pills for gut health and colostrum powder that she doesn’t even dare drink on camera.  Listening to Whitney talk about what colostrum is and how this is derived from newborn calves is high level comedy.  Girl, please.  Zach shows up to whine about his weight loss journey.  He had made it down to 214 pounds, but then gained it all back.  Probably because his diet is strictly red meat, cheese and butter.  If you jab him, gravy oozes out.  Seriously, the same stuff Erin Paine is rubbing all over her face, Zach is using to cook with.  But he thinks he should share his healthy living tips?  Dude… go sell a house.  The Medic Corps guy Hubert’s wife, known on IG as “DrewsGal” is in town for the week and she helps Whitney promote the Boutique’s new fall sweaters.  At this point, Whitney is the only one still holding on to the boutique.  Whitney takes the 3 youngest kids to Target so she can exploit them while they pull toys off of the shelf and fall around in the buggy.  Back in the Bates Kitchen, Zach has landed a powdered greens supplement as a sponsor.  Instead of drinking the powdered greens, he talks about how amazing it is while frying eggs.  This man is a walking conundrum.  He struggles through a basic banana bread recipe while correcting himself and telling people if they really want to know how to make it, read the description because what he’s doing is a whole mess.  He whines about having to edit the vlog himself and explains how long that takes.  Good reminder of how long these people spend piecing together the life they want you to see.
 
 
 
6.Lawd Lydia Bates can’t catch a break.  This poor woman is just not cut out for the Bates life.  She shows up in their weekly vlog looking like straight death warmed over.  Her skin is a mottled greenish grey and the black circles under her eyes have a story to tell.  Her hair is falling out of a ponytail and she’s cradling her newborn while forcing a smile.  Guess who is bright, shiny, well put together and flashing a cheesy grin sitting right beside her?  Yep, that goober husband of hers who is determined to make her keep on going.  Trace cheerfully announces that Lydia has been back to the hospital… again.  After giving birth she had an infection that required a hospital stay, then immediately had her wisdom teeth out and then spiked another fever and went back to the hospital for more IV antibiotics.  Lydia tries to force a giggle and says that she promises she is going to stay at home and rest and recover.  Supposedly they were planning to head to Momma Jane’s for the week, but the illness canceled those plans.  That leaves them with nothing to film so they decide to rip Ryker’s nursery apart, squeeze a second crib in that tiny room, pack everything else in there… and then say the baby won’t be sleeping in there for quite some time.   They had to do a vlog because they had a partnership with the largest TV known to man.  The thing takes up the entire wall in their house and retails for around $5,000.  Get up off of your sick bed, Lydia!  Trace needs a big azz TV to watch himself on!  The rest of the week Lydia shares pictures of the baby and Ryker and posts obviously photo shopped body check pictures of herself standing at every angle in the full length mirror.  It is obvious that being thin is very important to her… even to her own detriment. 
 
 
 
7.Michael finally convinces Brandon to post a new YouTube vlog after being reduced to sharing black bean muffin content for days on end.  Who is eating a black bean muffin is what I want to know?  Michael gets back from helping with Josie’s kids, and Brandon gets home from work and they sit down at their TV trays to give an update on their life.  They still have the foster children, and were able to get permission to take them out of state for the 4th of July.  They went to Michigan for a good old fundie time and later, went to the farm to see Momma Jane.  All of Michael’s siblings gave big performances when Papa Bill passed away, but it is obvious that Michael’s grief is real.  She said it was too soon for her to be on the farm on his birthday and that it was unbelievably hard to go back.  She shares another funeral picture and explains that because of the boys, they had to go to the funeral and get back in one day.  They promote Brandon’s weird medieval story books and talk about how he dressed up as some 17th century figure for story time at Bible School.  The 3 year old is in school and he loves it and the baby has started laughing.  They don’t say much about the future, but the boys have been there for a while now.  Brandon admits that parenting is not all he thought it would be and you can almost imagine the slap in the face it has given them. 
 
 
 
8.Erin Paine is serious about her beef fat.  This week she sent PR packages out to all of the other fundie influencers and featured a few of them who were willing to promote it for her.  She then hid in the bathroom and filmed a 5 minute skin care and makeup routine that started with her slathering on the grease while talking about lymphatic drainage.  Up close Erin has tons of skin damage and she fails to mention that in the Florida sun her dead cow grease acts like tanning oil.  Girlfriend needs an SPF 50, stat! Erin was really feeling herself and featured a picture of her bump in a super tight dress.  Josie takes pity on her sister and leaves a comment on her tutorial.  Erin is overjoyed and that pushes her to turn the tutorial into a reel.  Listen, anything to bring in some coins because what we don’t see is Chad Paine.  He’s somewhere under 25 loads of laundry, relegated to house husband status while Erin tries to keep this mess afloat.  Someone asks her what her mom will do if she and Carlin go into labor on the same day… she doesn’t answer, but I don’t think Erin has much longer before Henry’s grand arrival.
 
 
 
9.It was a normal week of Lawson Bates meandering about half dressed.  He films several reels shirtless, and flexes his muscles while holding the steering wheel.  They both toss baby Will around and film cringe content forcing the baby to either BE the butt of the joke, or to participate in their lame jokes.  Will seems to be good at walking out of frame.  Keep that up buddy.  Lawson has a new music video featuring the baby and Tiffy says over and over and over that Lawson is the love of her life. The new song is really a remake of an Aaron Tippin classic, but Lawson can’t hit those high notes, so the entire thing is auto tuned into oblivion. Tiffany is obsessed with pointing out how much the baby looks like Lawson (he does not) and how he has Lawson’s dimples.  After mentioning that Tiffy doesn’t sling links like the other Bates… guess what happens this week?  That’s right… momma starts sharing links to everything.   She recaps their night out with Callie for her birthday and features the Ruth’s Chris $55 special.  There is no new vlog probably because neither one of them knows what they have, or not have shared at this point.  There content remains all over the place, all of the time.  The only consistent thing is that there is a lot of it… and it is all bad.
 
10.Bits and Bytes… Zach Bates follows the Happily Evans After family and they have almost a million followers.  This week they shared how a crazy guy showed up at their house and attempted to break in.  Do we think that makes any of these people slow down and address the safety of their children??...Katie and Travis shared a q and a where Travis explains he is in school to get an associate’s degree and will then have to continue on to become a registered nurse.  He has big dreams of becoming a CRNA and working in a cardiovascular OR.  He says he has been in school since before his dad’s heart surgery.  Many people think he had to take general ed classes because his fake degree from his family’s fake college wouldn’t transfer.  In this same vlog, Katie assures everyone that she is not stressed and is super happy.  I mean, if you have to say it…they say the podcast just died on the vine because the guys never pursued it.  Is there a separation between the Stewarts and the Clarks happening?  There hasn’t been as much cross over lately…Kelly Joe wishes Josie a happy 26th birthday by calling her perfect…Esther shows Kenna helping Nathan wash airplanes…BSB goes days without posting or promoting anything.  Their new fall line features a $50 cardigan and a $70 black denim nightmare frock…Brooklyn Paine turns 9 and Kelly features her and her mom shares pictures of the of sistermom.

4.Guess who isn’t on an influencer trip or a content trip or being driven around in a self-driving car by her husband?  Alyssa Webster, of course.  She lives in a tropical wonderland, but every day is grey…sepia toned actually because of the filter.  This week the kids get all dressed up for church and Alyssa posts a few group shots of the girls and then solo pictures of Prince Rhett making terrible faces while wearing a bowtie clipped between the top and second button of his shirt.  It looks ridiculous, but he’s a MALE and must wear the tie to church.  The kids get a huge treat of dinner at Waffle House and they also get to celebrate back to school.  This celebration is a bit muted because they never stopped school… but Alyssa is doing it for the Gram.  The Back to School dinner features paper plates and plastic silverware and colored typing paper place mats.  The theme is pencils and apples.  This is probably really confusing for the girls, but apples are easier to draw and color than DVD players and headphones.  Once the excitement is over, ole wet blanket Alyssa shares a half dead house plant and says the kids dropped it and it is going to die and it’s all their fault.  The plant is yellow to the root and wilted badly but sure, Mommy Dearest, blame it on the kids.  Meanwhile, they spend most of the week lined up on the couch playing MarioKart.  Only Rhett gets to escape for a “walk” with mom.  He’s strapped into a stroller, but at least he sees the world outside of the playroom.  At some point she discovers a new filter called “natural skin” and uses that to feature… a trip to the car wash.  It turns everything clay colored and warped, so I am sure she fell in love with it instantly.  Lurch shows up to take her on a double date to a dirt road and deserted field.  It’s like the beginning of a Lifetime movie.  They pose for pictures out in the field and John is still wearing those high water jeans with the shiny black patent leather church shoes.  Alyssa wants new boots bc the pair she refuses to take off, even in the swamp weather that is August in Florida, she has had since she was 16 years old.  No new boots for you missy until you purchase some shoes for your kids and they quit wearing those absolutely awful, orange, fake leather ankle booties.
 
 
 
5.Surely thought the days of Whitney Bates struggling through an ad read for some cheap powder supplement or teeth whitening strips were long gone.  Alas, they are not.  She can’t get her husband to keep a steady job, so she has to choke down whatever supplement is willing to pay.  This week that was a bunch of pills for gut health and colostrum powder that she doesn’t even dare drink on camera.  Listening to Whitney talk about what colostrum is and how this is derived from newborn calves is high level comedy.  Girl, please.  Zach shows up to whine about his weight loss journey.  He had made it down to 214 pounds, but then gained it all back.  Probably because his diet is strictly red meat, cheese and butter.  If you jab him, gravy oozes out.  Seriously, the same stuff Erin Paine is rubbing all over her face, Zach is using to cook with.  But he thinks he should share his healthy living tips?  Dude… go sell a house.  The Medic Corps guy Hubert’s wife, known on IG as “DrewsGal” is in town for the week and she helps Whitney promote the Boutique’s new fall sweaters.  At this point, Whitney is the only one still holding on to the boutique.  Whitney takes the 3 youngest kids to Target so she can exploit them while they pull toys off of the shelf and fall around in the buggy.  Back in the Bates Kitchen, Zach has landed a powdered greens supplement as a sponsor.  Instead of drinking the powdered greens, he talks about how amazing it is while frying eggs.  This man is a walking conundrum.  He struggles through a basic banana bread recipe while correcting himself and telling people if they really want to know how to make it, read the description because what he’s doing is a whole mess.  He whines about having to edit the vlog himself and explains how long that takes.  Good reminder of how long these people spend piecing together the life they want you to see.
 
 
 
6.Lawd Lydia Bates can’t catch a break.  This poor woman is just not cut out for the Bates life.  She shows up in their weekly vlog looking like straight death warmed over.  Her skin is a mottled greenish grey and the black circles under her eyes have a story to tell.  Her hair is falling out of a ponytail and she’s cradling her newborn while forcing a smile.  Guess who is bright, shiny, well put together and flashing a cheesy grin sitting right beside her?  Yep, that goober husband of hers who is determined to make her keep on going.  Trace cheerfully announces that Lydia has been back to the hospital… again.  After giving birth she had an infection that required a hospital stay, then immediately had her wisdom teeth out and then spiked another fever and went back to the hospital for more IV antibiotics.  Lydia tries to force a giggle and says that she promises she is going to stay at home and rest and recover.  Supposedly they were planning to head to Momma Jane’s for the week, but the illness canceled those plans.  That leaves them with nothing to film so they decide to rip Ryker’s nursery apart, squeeze a second crib in that tiny room, pack everything else in there… and then say the baby won’t be sleeping in there for quite some time.   They had to do a vlog because they had a partnership with the largest TV known to man.  The thing takes up the entire wall in their house and retails for around $5,000.  Get up off of your sick bed, Lydia!  Trace needs a big azz TV to watch himself on!  The rest of the week Lydia shares pictures of the baby and Ryker and posts obviously photo shopped body check pictures of herself standing at every angle in the full length mirror.  It is obvious that being thin is very important to her… even to her own detriment. 
 
 
 
7.Michael finally convinces Brandon to post a new YouTube vlog after being reduced to sharing black bean muffin content for days on end.  Who is eating a black bean muffin is what I want to know?  Michael gets back from helping with Josie’s kids, and Brandon gets home from work and they sit down at their TV trays to give an update on their life.  They still have the foster children, and were able to get permission to take them out of state for the 4th of July.  They went to Michigan for a good old fundie time and later, went to the farm to see Momma Jane.  All of Michael’s siblings gave big performances when Papa Bill passed away, but it is obvious that Michael’s grief is real.  She said it was too soon for her to be on the farm on his birthday and that it was unbelievably hard to go back.  She shares another funeral picture and explains that because of the boys, they had to go to the funeral and get back in one day.  They promote Brandon’s weird medieval story books and talk about how he dressed up as some 17th century figure for story time at Bible School.  The 3 year old is in school and he loves it and the baby has started laughing.  They don’t say much about the future, but the boys have been there for a while now.  Brandon admits that parenting is not all he thought it would be and you can almost imagine the slap in the face it has given them. 
 
 
 
8.Erin Paine is serious about her beef fat.  This week she sent PR packages out to all of the other fundie influencers and featured a few of them who were willing to promote it for her.  She then hid in the bathroom and filmed a 5 minute skin care and makeup routine that started with her slathering on the grease while talking about lymphatic drainage.  Up close Erin has tons of skin damage and she fails to mention that in the Florida sun her dead cow grease acts like tanning oil.  Girlfriend needs an SPF 50, stat! Erin was really feeling herself and featured a picture of her bump in a super tight dress.  Josie takes pity on her sister and leaves a comment on her tutorial.  Erin is overjoyed and that pushes her to turn the tutorial into a reel.  Listen, anything to bring in some coins because what we don’t see is Chad Paine.  He’s somewhere under 25 loads of laundry, relegated to house husband status while Erin tries to keep this mess afloat.  Someone asks her what her mom will do if she and Carlin go into labor on the same day… she doesn’t answer, but I don’t think Erin has much longer before Henry’s grand arrival.
 
 
 
9.It was a normal week of Lawson Bates meandering about half dressed.  He films several reels shirtless, and flexes his muscles while holding the steering wheel.  They both toss baby Will around and film cringe content forcing the baby to either BE the butt of the joke, or to participate in their lame jokes.  Will seems to be good at walking out of frame.  Keep that up buddy.  Lawson has a new music video featuring the baby and Tiffy says over and over and over that Lawson is the love of her life. The new song is really a remake of an Aaron Tippin classic, but Lawson can’t hit those high notes, so the entire thing is auto tuned into oblivion. Tiffany is obsessed with pointing out how much the baby looks like Lawson (he does not) and how he has Lawson’s dimples.  After mentioning that Tiffy doesn’t sling links like the other Bates… guess what happens this week?  That’s right… momma starts sharing links to everything.   She recaps their night out with Callie for her birthday and features the Ruth’s Chris $55 special.  There is no new vlog probably because neither one of them knows what they have, or not have shared at this point.  There content remains all over the place, all of the time.  The only consistent thing is that there is a lot of it… and it is all bad.
 
10.Bits and Bytes… Zach Bates follows the Happily Evans After family and they have almost a million followers.  This week they shared how a crazy guy showed up at their house and attempted to break in.  Do we think that makes any of these people slow down and address the safety of their children??...Katie and Travis shared a q and a where Travis explains he is in school to get an associate’s degree and will then have to continue on to become a registered nurse.  He has big dreams of becoming a CRNA and working in a cardiovascular OR.  He says he has been in school since before his dad’s heart surgery.  Many people think he had to take general ed classes because his fake degree from his family’s fake college wouldn’t transfer.  In this same vlog, Katie assures everyone that she is not stressed and is super happy.  I mean, if you have to say it…they say the podcast just died on the vine because the guys never pursued it.  Is there a separation between the Stewarts and the Clarks happening?  There hasn’t been as much cross over lately…Kelly Joe wishes Josie a happy 26th birthday by calling her perfect…Esther shows Kenna helping Nathan wash airplanes…BSB goes days without posting or promoting anything.  Their new fall line features a $50 cardigan and a $70 black denim nightmare frock…Brooklyn Paine turns 9 and Kelly features her and her mom shares pictures of the of sistermom.

I purchased a Gaggia Pro E24 a little over a month ago and have struggled to pull a decent shot. No matter what I try, my espresso consistently comes out very sour.

I’ve spent a lot of time researching, reading and watching tutorials on dialing in to improve but haven’t had much luck after going through many bags of coffee.

Some of the things I’ve done to try and make improvements:

- Different grind sizes and shot lengths but maintained 
Consistent dosing, tamping, and using a WDT tool

- Preheating the machine and using the open portafilter with the appropriate basket

- Upgraded to an IMS shower screen

- Took detailed notes adjusting with every shot and followed multiple guides and tutorials

Despite all this, I can’t seem to nail a good shot of espresso. I’ve gone through a lot of coffee experimenting with adjustments, but the results are always sour.

I’m hoping for some feedback with a post of a video with my flow to help. I made a video of a standard flow I do that follows some of the guides.",1,1754859971.0,espresso,24,0.67,False

I’m James Clayton — lifelong sci-fi nut, coffee devotee, and unapologetic action-adventure junkie. I spent years teaching 3D animation before deciding to leap into a whole new dimension: storytelling.

My debut novel is available on Amazon, ***Vanguardian Saga: The Road to Molz Dorn.*** *The story* follows an elite black-ops team of anthropomorphic heroes sent on an impossible mission to a hostile planet. Picture G.I. Joe meets Zootopia meets Gears of War — with claws, laser rifles, and a whole lot of space pirates.

At the heart of it all is Kahl Striver, a black-ops tiger soldier who has a talent for surviving suicide missions alongside his crew of space marines… and making his enemies wish they’d never been born.

The book’s a fast-paced space opera for ages 12 and up, inspired by the pulse-pounding 90s anime I grew up with — *Ghost in the Shell*, *Ninja Scroll*, *Outlaw Star* — packed with grit, spectacle, heart, and yes… just a dash of gore.

If that’s your thing, give it a look! And if you’ve got questions about the book or the universe, I’m happy to answer them. Thanks for reading, and see you on Molz Dorn!",1,1754859750.0,wroteabook,0,1.0,False

1mmtykx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1mmtykx/bad_start_with_extreme_dizziness_and_fatigue/,Bad start with extreme dizziness and fatigue...,"I started Bupropion 150mg (generic, Ratiopharm - I'm in Europe) around 21 days ago and the first 2 weeks have been great. The med helped a lot with my crippling anxiety and depression. There has been energy, I've been able to socialize and it started off really promising.

I have a recent diagnosis of being prediabetic at a blood sugar of 101 but I haven't been prescribed any Metformin yet other than just taking care of myself and losing weight. I started intermittent fasting (16:8 at a calorie deficit, also worth noting I have no sugar intake and control my carbs) and getting more frequent cardio and it's been no problem to settle in so far. I have never had any symptoms of prediabetes or issues with it unless I eat potatos and I crossed them off my meal plan years ago. Sorry if I started off with the dietary stuff, but I figure there's a bit of history worth nothing.

But now that I'm past the 21 day mark I'm starting to get hit by all sorts of side effects and I'm feeling the urgency to bail. I take my Bupropion in the morning with a small meal. I also drink a cup of coffee, but nothing super stimulating. Everything is fine and dandy in the morning hours until I start to get hungry at 3PM and eat dinner where the biggest calorie intake takes place. Never had an issue there, I've been doing OMAD between the fasts because I like skipping breakfast sometimes.

But a new thing that started happening now is that every time I eat dinner on Bupropion I start to get tired, dizzy. The symptoms are almost identical to hypoglycemia to a point I had to rush to drink a glass of fruit juice to get my sugar up and from there the symptoms dissipate a bit. Today I almost fainted twice and I've been struggling to get up and move around at all. And it's been gradual, at a few days ago I was a bit dizzy, then the next day not at all, now the other day I got very dizzy and today I'm in a state so bad I can no longer work stably. I'm afraid of tomorrow, I don't want to take it anymore and feel like this again.

The dizziness also has been accompanied by extreme tiredness and fatigue as of late. Sometimes I can't sleep at all which doesn't help, but I got it more or less under control with an extra dosage of Magnesium before bed. So far Bupropion started great but now I'm in absolute distress because it's been making me unable to work and knocks me out on the daily to a state I feel like a zombie.

I'm not new to Antidepressants having a long easing-in kind of time (I have a long history using Fluoxetin on and off for almost 10 years, some antipsychotics at night take 2+ weeks to work reliably too), but Bupropion turned from a comfort taking away my anxiety to an absolute nightmare I need to get off asap because I'm losing many hours at work now and I get progressively more depressed and anxious due to all of this going wrong.

I don't know where to take this because my partner is just lost and can't help me. Should I quit? Should I bite the bullet and continue? Am I doing something wrong?

I currently can't reach a doctor as I live in a very remote place and they are on summer vacation right now. Same goes for my psych too, so I'm stranded until September and a bottle of pills I'm not sure I should commit to anymore.",1,1754859544.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,1.0,False

Does anyone really think Mr “no clickbait ever” who goes through so much production for 99% of his videos would really release such a clunker boring video on his main channel if he wasn’t getting something under the table?

He started a second channel for simpler videos that all have way more effort put into them than the day trading scam vid.

The guy has a 1k+ course that they did everything but directly advertise.

Cody isn’t the brightest bulb but he’s not so dumb to let that day trader completely play him like that.

Extremely strong suspicion Cody was starting to see some financial strain with his big projects and trips to Dubai, almost definitely struggling with substance abuse issues.

I can definitely imagine that day trading course merchant slimeball approaching Cody with an idea.. “I’ll send you $200k to your crypto wallet and we make a fun video day trading and driving my cars, I’ll pay you under the table so we don’t need to mark it as an advertisement… it’s a win, win, win”.

I suspect Coffee didn’t touch this angle because it’s near unprovable and coffee didn’t want to open himself up to litigation.  WD obviously be aware of the financial gain slimeball would get by putting him front and center on his platform.

Im certain WD is too protective of his channel/brand to put out that stinker video unless he was getting a nice paycheck.

Cody is obviously not the sharpest tool in the shed, about as sharp as a marble most would say… but he’s not so stupid he’d get played so hard by that slimeball… but he definitely thinks we were dumb enough to buy his story.",35,1754859534.0,WhistlinDiesel,6,1.0,False

1mmtxav,https://i.redd.it/utof84u4a9if1.jpeg,First batch on the pile!,"Hi all! I’ve been an allotment owner for about 6 months now, and I’ve become hyper-fixated on composting. I’ve been lurking here for a while, so i thought i’d share my set-up with you…

As you can see, i have 2 tumblers which receives most of my house waste, including loads of coffee grounds and teabags which i split before i add them. The only thing i don’t put in it is meat.

The tumblers get sloppy when the food starts to break down, so i add browns - mostly cardboard which i shred in a chipper. They get super hot and everything turns nice and black super quick.

I put all my weeds in a bucket and drown them for 2 weeks before they’re added to the tumblers. I use the leftover broth to water the compost, or i dilute it and use for plant feed.

Today, i transferred my first batch from the tumbler to the bin which i made out of marine birchwood ply board.

It was a good 4-5” of compost in the bottom of the bin… i emptied a bag of hay on top of it, and then a load of cardboard, then watered it all with weed broth. I’ll be dumping my drowned weeds and green offcuts (rhubarb leaves etc.) directly on to the pile from now on and keep the tumblers exclusively for stink household waste. I plan to add fresh cut grass in the next few weeks. I also plan to get some worms and add them to my pile to help out. 

1 last thing - i still can’t work out if the whole “piss on your pile” thing is a big troll, but regardless, i’ve started doing that.

I wasn't Invited to My Husband's Wedding novel
“I want to file for divorce.”

The words had been stuck in my throat for years—until that night. I had cooked his favorite meal, worn a dress he once loved, and dared to ask about the trip he promised me decades ago.

“Paris?” he scoffed, eyes glued to his laptop. “You’re not that young anymore.”

“Twenty years ago, you said that one day, when things got better, we’d go. We’d celebrate properly. I just… want to enjoy something after taking care of you, the kids, and this house—”

“Oh, so we tired you out?” he snapped. “Don’t make it sound like I forced you into this. You just stay home. What’s so hard about your job? Why don’t you be more like your sister Camille? Unmarried, independent, smart—she earned her own money and her place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn’t burden anyone.”

He shut me out. Worse still, I accidentally saw an email—a wedding confirmation. His wedding with Camille. In Paris. The guest list? My father, our son, and his wife—

My family. Everyone… but me. They hadn’t just excluded me. They had replaced me.

That’s when I knew I had to leave. After twenty years of being nothing but convenient, I finally woke up—and chose myself. I booked a one-way ticket to Paris and forgot about them. Only for them to realize my worth when it was too late.

--

“I want to file for divorce.”

The words came out steady as if they had been waiting in my throat all along, finally tasting air for the first time.

There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Are you sure about this, ma’am? You’ve been married for twenty years.”

I looked around my bedroom—the walls I painted, the curtains I sewed, the furniture I polished every weekend like some loyal housemaid. The scent of lavender fabric softener clung to the bedsheets. Everything was clean. Perfect. Lifeless.

“Yes,” I said, firm this time. “I’m sure. File it as soon as possible. I want to leave this house immediately.”

I hung up before I could hear her response.

The silence afterward was strange—peaceful, but laced with a kind of ache only a woman like me would understand. The ache of finality. Of choosing myself after being forgotten for far too long.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror. My lips trembled, but I didn’t cry. Not yet.

Instead, my mind drifted back to that moment. The exact one where I knew this marriage—this life—was over.

It was a quiet evening. The house smelled like fresh pasta. I had spent the whole afternoon preparing his favorite meal. I wore a soft blue dress I hadn’t worn in years, thinking maybe—just maybe—he would notice.

I sat beside him on the couch, watching him review some documents from his firm, and then finally asked him about my dream destination, Paris, which he’d promised me.

“Paris?” he repeated with a laugh, not even looking up from his laptop. “What for? You’re not that young anymore. Can’t we skip the formalities? It’s not important.”

I stood there, holding my breath like a delicate glass.

“You promised,” I said softly. “Twenty years ago. You said one day, when things are better, we’ll go. We’d celebrate properly.”

Kier leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes. “With what money? Are you using your savings? Oh, wait—you don’t have your own money.”

I blinked. “Can’t it be a gift? I just… want to enjoy something. After taking care of you. Of the kids. Of this house—”

“Oh, so we tired you out?” he snapped. “Don’t make it sound like I forced you into this. You’re just staying home. What’s even hard about your job? I make the money. You get to sit in the comfort of this house and complain about wanting a vacation.”

Your job.

That word always scraped at me like a dull knife. As if motherhood, marriage, and being a woman were simple lines on a to-do list. As if the years I spent making everyone else’s life easier meant nothing. Like my work began and ended in the kitchen.

He went on. “Why don’t you be more like your sister Camille? She’s not even your sister by blood, and yet she’s miles ahead. Unmarried, independent, smart—she earned her own money and place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn’t burden anyone for it.”

Camille. The orphan they adopted when I was fifteen. The golden girl who walked into our lives and stole every single piece of love I thought I owned.

Before I could respond, my father walked in—David, stern as ever, with that gaze that had never once looked at me with pride.

“She’s right,” he said, sipping tea as if he hadn’t just walked into a storm. “Camille is the better woman. Smart. Practical. Knows what she wants.”

Then he looked at me.

“You, Erika… you were born into this house, but sometimes I wonder if that was the real mistake.”

I stared at him, silent.

“There’s a reason why Camille’s thriving and you’re still stuck ironing clothes and burning food. If I had a choice, she’d be my daughter. She doesn’t rely on men for anything.”

The room spun, my breath tightening. I didn’t reply. I never did. I had learned over the years that pain was quieter when swallowed.

But that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt.

I thought I could endure that and continue living this life, but not until that same night. He left his laptop open on the dining table. The email app still running. I wasn’t snooping. I swear, I wasn’t. But the subject line caught my eye:

“Paris – Wedding Confirmation”

My heart stopped. I clicked it.

Inside was a beautifully crafted itinerary. Elegant fonts. Gold accents. Venue details. Champagne menus.

A wedding. In Paris. Kier and Camille.

And the guest list? My father. My son. His wife.

My family.

Everyone… but me.

They hadn’t just excluded me. They had replaced me.

I finally snapped when I heard Kier’s voice from the bedroom. 

“Erika!”

I turned slightly.

He threw a wrinkled shirt at me.

“You really don’t know how to do your job? What on earth did you do to my clothes?”

Chapter 2

The shirt hit my face with a sharp snap, then fell to the floor.

“What is this?” Kier barked, glaring at the wrinkled garment. “Why the heck isn’t this done yet?”

I bent to pick it up, blood from the wound on my palm still seeping into the bandage.

“I’m sorry,” I said softly. “I got caught up with the laundry, and I was cleaning—then the vase earlier—”

“Oh, so you’re still making excuses now?” His voice rose. “Is that it, Erika? You want a Paris honeymoon but can’t even do basic chores?”

He threw a second bundle of white clothes at me, this one speckled with a pale yellow stain.

“And what about this? Look at it!” he snapped. “You ruined it. This is designer. Do you even know how expensive this was?”

I stared at the stain—barely visible—but in his eyes, it was a catastrophe.

“I didn’t see it,” I murmured. “I’ll fix it.”

“God, Erika,” he exclaimed. “This is your job. Your only job. You get to sit in this house, have whatever you want handed to you, and the one thing I ask—keep the house in order—and even that’s too hard?”

Before I could gather my words, the front door opened, and a familiar voice rang out, honey-sweet and full of sparkle.

“Kier! Brother-in-law! Why are you shouting again?” Camille.

She entered with her usual grand entrance—sun-kissed from her trip, her long curls bouncing, arms full of designer bags and luggage with tags still hanging from them.

“Oh, look at this!” she grinned, placing the gifts down. “Spain was beautiful. You’d love it, Kier. I brought you something.”

Kier immediately softened. “Camille, you didn’t have to—”

She held out a sleek box. “These are custom pieces from Madrid. Only a few made. I saw them and thought of you.”

He opened the box like a child with a toy, smiling wide.

Then Camille looked at me, feigning concern. “Why were you shouting at my sister? She looks tired. Look at her hands—she’s clearly been working hard. Don’t worry about the shirt. I brought you new ones.”

And just like that, I faded into the background again.

The front door opened once more.

“Camille! My star!” my father David boomed, walking in with arms full of gifts. “How was the trip? Tell us everything!”

She hugged him like the daughter he always wished I had been. “I closed the deal. It’s done!”

“Of course you did,” David beamed. “I always say—best decision I ever made was bringing you into this family.”

They laughed. They toasted water glasses. They complimented each other like a well-rehearsed play.

I stood in the corner like a piece of furniture.

Then Kier turned to me, already irritated. “Well? What are you doing just standing there? Go prepare food for your sister. She just brought us gifts, the least you could do is cook.”

Camille walked toward me with another box.

“Sis, I got something for you too,” she said with a fake smile. “Since I know you love cooking… it’s an apron. With matching kitchen mitts and measuring cups. Cute, right? You can wear it now while making dinner.”

I stared at it, lips tightening. I forced a small nod.

“Thanks.”

“Say it properly,” my father barked. “Where are your manners?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “Thank you, Camille.”

“See?” David grunted. “Stop babying her, Camille. She should be grateful. Let her show it through actions. Go, cook for us.”

So I cooked.

I cut. I chopped. I stirred and fried and cleaned, bleeding and aching all the while. I did it like I always did—without complaint, without recognition.

But when I called them to the table, I was met with silence.

Kier was the first to speak. “Actually, don’t bother. We’re heading out.”

“What?”

“Camille closed a major deal. We’re going to celebrate at Florentina’s. You know, that new luxury place near the harbor.”

Camille laughed. “You’ll love it, Kier. I booked the private balcony. It’s stunning.”

Then she turned to me, suddenly remembering. “Come with us, sis?”

But before I could answer, Kier scoffed. “No need. Erika doesn’t even understand what the deal was about. She’ll be out of place. Doesn’t even have clothes for a place like that.”

“She can borrow mine—” Camille offered half-heartedly.

Kier waved her off. “She’s staying. She’s behind on the laundry anyway.”

And like that, they all agreed. Camille smiled, my father chuckled, and my husband kissed Camille’s hand like it was nothing.

And I—once again—was left standing in a kitchen filled with steam, silence, and the scent of food no one would eat.

That night, after washing every plate, folding napkins, and mopping the floor, I sank onto the couch.

I opened my phone to escape—to scroll, to feel something other than this ache.

That’s when I saw it.

A new post. From my son.

Joseph.

I clicked.

There they were.

In Florentina’s.

Laughing. Drinking. Eating. Clinking wine glasses. My son. My husband. My father. Camille. Smiling like they were a perfect family.

Without me.

I stared at the screen, my hands trembling.

No caption. No mention. Just a perfect picture of everything I wasn’t allowed to be part of.

I had cooked for them. Served them. Loved them.

And they had forgotten me. Left me.

Again.

The tears came quietly this time. Not loud or dramatic. Just slow, tired, and steady. I didn’t sob. I didn’t scream.

I just let the ache fall from my eyes… because no one was ever going to notice.

Chapter 3

My eyes were swollen when I woke up. I must’ve cried myself to sleep on the couch because the stiffness in my back told me I hadn’t moved all night.

And I was late.

I scrambled to my feet, realizing with horror that I hadn’t prepared breakfast—the one thing they expected from me without fail, every single day.

As I rushed into the kitchen, I heard the sharp edge of Kier’s voice from the dining room.

“Where have you been?” he snapped, seeing me step into the room. “Still sleeping at this hour? Where’s breakfast?”

Before I could open my mouth, Camille emerged from the kitchen with a spatula in hand, smiling as if none of it was serious.

“Don’t worry,” she said brightly. “I already started cooking. She’s tired, so I let my sister sleep a little longer.”

“No!” Kier barked. “She should be ashamed of herself. Sleeping while you, our guest, cook? All she does is stay home, and now she’s even pushing her responsibility onto you?”

He turned to me, fuming. “Have some care for the people feeding you. Do something useful.”

I lowered my gaze and stepped past Camille quietly. “It’s okay,” I said softly. “I’ll handle the cooking. You just sit and wait.”

Camille smiled, brushing her hair over her shoulder. “It’s fine. It’s just chopping vegetables. Don’t make it a big deal.”

But before I could respond, our father walked in, placing a mug on the table.

“Even if it’s just chopping, you shouldn’t do that, Camille,” he said. “Your hands aren’t made for the kitchen. You’re a designer, not a housemaid. Let Erika handle it—it’s her thing.”

“It’s not a big deal, Dad,” Camille said with a small laugh, taking a knife anyway. “I can help.”

“No, really, I’ll do it,” I said again, trying to take the knife from her hand.

But she insisted, and I didn’t want to start an argument in front of everyone, so I let it go.

We stood side by side at the counter, both cutting vegetables in a tense silence, until suddenly—

“Agh!” Camille shrieked.

Blood dripped from her finger. She dropped the knife as Kier rushed into the kitchen in panic.

“What on earth happened?!” he shouted, grabbing her hand. “You’re bleeding! For heaven's sake, Camille, your hand—do you even know how important that is?! You have a presentation next week!”

“It’s okay, it’s just a scratch—”

Kier turned on me before she could even finish.

“This is your fault! You useless woman! You let her get hurt in your own kitchen! You couldn’t even chop those vegetables yourself?”

I was stunned. “I—I didn’t—”

But it didn’t matter. Camille tried to defend me, but her voice was drowned out by the chaos. They were all hovering over her, pressing tissues to her wound, blaming me for things I hadn’t done.

And I didn’t even have the chance to explain that I had a wound too.

The cut I got from cleaning up the broken vase hadn’t healed, and now with the kitchen work, it had split open again.

But no one noticed. So I quietly stepped away, my bleeding hand hidden under the edge of my apron, and went back to my room.

I sat on the edge of the bed, peeled off the bandage, and sighed as I pressed a clean towel to the reopened wound. The sting was sharp, but the silence stung more.

Then the door burst open.

Kier.

“Apologize to Camille,” he ordered.

I looked at him. “It wasn’t my fault. She insisted. It was an accident.”

He narrowed his eyes. “So what? You’re still responsible. Apologize.”

“I didn’t hurt her.”

“I don’t care. Just do it.”

Before I could respond, Camille entered the room too, still holding her bandaged finger.

“It’s okay,” she said, her voice soft now. “There’s no need for that. My sister is not at fault. It’s on me.”

I forced a nod, though my throat burned.

Camille glanced at Kier. “Anyway, we need to talk about the trip. Only three days away now.”

“Oh, right,” Kier said, his tone shifting instantly. “We’re heading to Paris. Business trip. I’ll need you to pack our things. I’m going, Camille’s going, and your dad too.”

Paris.

My heart skipped.

“Can I come?” I asked before I could stop myself.

They both looked at me.

Kier let out a harsh laugh. “You? Erika, it’s a business trip, not a vacation. Don’t dream too high. You wouldn’t even know how to keep up with the conversations. You’d just embarrass us.”

“I could just—”

“No,” he cut in. “This is for work. Camille’s part of the brand’s pitch. You’d be out of place. You don’t even have clothes for something like this.”

“I could—”

“She’ll stay,” he said flatly, turning to Camille. “She can finish the chores while we’re gone.”

Camille hesitated, eyes flicking to me with what might have been pity—or performance. “We’ll bring you something back,” she offered, with a thin smile.

My lips stretched into a small nod, but I felt it. The heat behind my eyes. The silence in my throat. The lump in my chest I had learned to swallow every day.

And then they laughed.

Not mean-spirited, not sharp—but casual. The way people laugh when they’re comfortable, when they forget someone else is in the room. Like I was a joke. Like I wasn’t even there.

Their voices trailed down the hallway as they made plans—restaurants in Paris, what Camille should wear, how the photos would look.

I turned slowly, walked into our room, and shut the door behind me.

No tears this time. Just stillness.

I moved on instinct, pulling the suitcase from under the bed, unfolding shirts, checking lists, laying out Camille’s makeup bag, folding Kier’s blazers. I didn’t think—I just did what I had always done: prepared everyone else’s life while mine sat on the shelf, untouched.

But then I saw it—Kier’s laptop.

It was still open, still glowing faintly on the nightstand. Like it was waiting for me.

I hesitated.

And then I moved toward it.

It took just one click.

There it was.

A photo. Clear as day.

Kier in a tailored suit. Camille in a white dress, smiling like she had already won. The Eiffel Tower blurred behind them, gold lights blinking in the background. Pre-nup photoshoot – Paris folder.

Another scroll down showed the wedding date. The one I’d seen in the email before. Confirmed.

They weren’t even trying to hide it anymore.

I stared at it.

But I didn’t cry.

Instead, I picked up my phone.

I dialed the gallery—the one I’d visited in secret once, where the photos lined the walls, each one glimmering with confidence and artistry. I remembered the way the assistant had smiled at me when I lingered in front of the bridal portrait display.

The phone rang once. Twice.

“How may I help you?”

I breathed in, slow and steady. Then spoke.

“I’d like to schedule a wedding shoot. A pre-nup session.”

“Of course, ma’am. May I ask the name of the bride and the groom?”

I paused.

Then smiled softly to myself.

“There is no groom,” I said. “Just the bride. Me. Alone.”

Because I was finally choosing myself.

Chapter 4

The necklace was gone.

I checked the drawer again, hands trembling. I sifted through scarves, opened every little pouch and box. Nothing. My chest began to tighten, panic seeping in like cold water.

No. No, no—it had to be here.

I turned the whole vanity upside down. And then it hit me.

Kier.

I rushed out of the bedroom, still in my robe, feet bare against the cold floor, and found him at the dining table, sipping his usual black coffee, flipping through files as if the world didn’t just tilt on its axis.

“Kier,” I said, my voice already breaking, “where’s my necklace? The silver one with the black stone. The one in the velvet box.”

He didn’t even glance up. “Oh, that? Gave it to Camille. Looked great on her. She’s wearing it in Paris.”

I blinked. “You gave it to Camille?”

“Yeah. Relax.” He flipped a page. “You weren’t using it.”

“It was mine,” I said quietly, my voice tight. “You didn’t even ask.”

He finally looked at me, sighing like I was a burden. “Erika. Be real. You probably bought it with my card anyway. What’s yours is mine, right? Why are you making this a thing?”

“No. I didn’t buy it with your card,” I snapped, hurt flooding my voice. “I bought it with my own money. Money I earned—on my own.”

His brow lifted slightly. “Doing what?”

“I’ve been designing again,” I said, my voice shaking. “Freelance. Quiet jobs. I’ve been saving for five years. That necklace… it was the first thing I bought for me in a long time.”

Kier scoffed. “Designing? What, kitchen aprons and pillowcases?”

I took a step back.

“You really don’t know me at all anymore, do you?”

“You’re being dramatic,” he muttered. “It’s just a necklace. I’ll get you a new one.”

“It was limited edition,” I whispered. “And I was going to wear it today. I was invited to a fashion show. I wanted to look like the woman I used to be, even for a day.”

Kier’s laugh cut through the air like a whip. “You? A fashion show?” He shook his head. “Erika, let’s be honest. You’ll be laughed at.”

I froze.

“You’re not that woman anymore,” he continued, like it was a fact he had long accepted. “You belong here. In this house. With your apron and your routines. Camille, on the other hand—she belongs on runways, in Paris, with people who matter.”

He stood, collected his folder, and headed toward the door.

“Don’t go to that show,” he said without turning back. “You’ll only embarrass yourself. I told you to pack for our things, right? Is it ready now? Do it! Make sure that we will not forget anything.” 

He left.

And I just stood there. No more tears. Just this strange, burning quiet in my chest. Not sadness, not heartbreak—just hatred. For the way I let myself become so small. For the way they never even had to raise their voices to crush me. For the way I spent twenty years handing out pieces of myself until there was nothing left but duties and silence.

I sat on the edge of the bed and looked around our bedroom—our curated little cage. The walls I had decorated. The sheets I washed. The photo frames that no longer held memories, just proof that I had once existed beside him.

I should’ve done this sooner.

I should’ve loved myself sooner.

But for twenty years, I chose to love a man who didn’t see me. I chose to serve a family that never said thank you. I chose quiet over conflict, sacrifice over self.

And what did it get me? Nothing.

I stood up.

I pulled out the dress I had planned to wear for the fashion show—the one Kier said was “too loud” for someone like me. I wore it proudly. Fixed my hair the way I liked it. Put on the lipstick he once said made me look “too old to matter.”

And then I left the house. They wouldn’t notice anyway.

I hailed a cab and gave the address to the gallery to finally do the photoshoot.

The assistant greeted me. “We’re ready for you,” she said, leading me into the sunlit studio. “You’ll look beautiful.”

I stepped in front of the camera.

The photographer adjusted the lens. “Are you sure you want these to look like bridal portraits… and you’ll be alone?”

I nodded. “Yes. I don’t have a husband.”

He nodded and then started taking photos. With every shot, I felt lighter. As if I were slowly peeling off the layers of someone else’s expectations.

I remembered Kier’s words from long ago—the ones that once made me stay.

“Erika, I know Camille is a star, but she’ll never want someone like me. She wants her career. You? You’ll stay. You’ll care. You’ll be my peace.”

He said he would give me the best life in return.

He gave me a kitchen. He gave Camille everything else.

I stood beneath the soft lights and smiled at the camera. Not a forced smile, not the kind I wore when guests came over or when Camille handed me a gift “just because.”

This smile was mine.

I left the studio with a print in hand. A single photograph of me in a dress I chose, in a life I finally began to claim.

That evening, the house was still empty. They had all gone out—another dinner, maybe another celebration. Probably laughing, posting photos I wasn’t in.

I didn’t care.

Because I wasn’t staying.

I opened my laptop. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Flight to Paris – One seat.

I clicked.

Booked.

I would go to Paris—not as a wife or a plus-one.

Not as a ghost in someone else’s celebration.

But as a woman fulfilling her own dream.

Chapter 5

The next morning, I stayed in bed, the suitcase zipped and ready by the door. I heard footsteps, voices, laughter in the hallway. I didn’t move.

But then Kier barged into the room, annoyed. “Where is the necklace?”

I sat up slowly. “What necklace?”

“That necklace—the limited edition one I gave to Camille. It’s missing. Did you take it back?”

I blinked. “Why would I take it back? You’re the one who gave it away. Without even asking me.”

“It’s gone,” he growled. “She was supposed to wear it today. And now you’ve stooped low enough to steal it back? Unbelievable.”

I stared at him, stunned. “You think I’m the one who’s low?”

“This is why you’re not coming with us,” he snapped. “You don’t deserve to be treated right. You’ve always been petty, Erika.”

Before I could answer, Camille entered the room, a bit flustered. “Wait, wait—it’s not her fault. I must have misplaced it. Don’t get mad at her.”

Their father, David, appeared behind them, tapping his watch. “We’re going to be late. Just buy another if you need to. Let’s go. Erika—make sure the house is clean by the time we return.”

And that was that.

They left.

No hug. No goodbye. No thank-you for the twenty years I gave them.

Just orders. Just silence.

I stood by the window and watched the car pull away, taking with it everything that once convinced me I was part of a family.

A few hours later, my phone buzzed.

Camille: Hey sis, we found the necklace! I’m so sorry about earlier. I’ll buy you something nice to make it up. Thank you again for letting me wear it—it’s so beautiful!

Then another ping.

Kier: Black card’s on the table. Buy whatever you want while we’re gone.

I read both messages and laughed. Softly, bitterly.

This was always the cycle, wasn’t it?

Hurt me. Humiliate me. Then hand me a credit card like it was a balm for the wounds they never acknowledged. As if the ability to shop would erase the fact that I was unwanted. Unloved. Undervalued.

But not this time.

I looked around the quiet house—empty now, like a ghost town echoing with memories that didn’t serve me anymore. Today, I was finished being their shadow.

I walked slowly to the living room, retrieved the envelope I had tucked beneath the couch cushion the night before, and placed it neatly on the coffee table.

Inside were the divorce papers, and also our wedding ring.

I stood for a long moment in the doorway. One last glance. Not for nostalgia. Just confirmation.

I wasn’t coming back.

At the airport, I sat near Gate 18, sipping quietly on a paper cup of coffee, staring at the glowing screen of my phone. I let myself smile. My life was beginning—at the exact moment they thought they had erased me.

I was mid-scroll through a rooftop restaurant review when a familiar voice sliced through the air.

“No way. My passport—where is it?”

Camille.

I froze. They were across the terminal, laughing, wheeling their designer luggage, wrapped in joy. My father, David, adjusting his tie. My son’s wife snapping a picture of the group. And Camille—rummaging through her purse, visibly agitated.

I doubt if they would even notice me as they’re busy on their own lives. 

Kier rubbed his forehead. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Didn’t Erika pack it for you?”

Camille blinked. “No, I… I asked her, but I don’t know if she—”

“She messed it up again. I told her to check everything,” Kier muttered, pulling out his phone. “I’ll call her. She can drop it off. It’s not like she’s busy.”

Of course.

Even now. Even after everything—they still expected me to fix their mess.

My phone rang.

Kier.

Then a message.

Kier: Camille left her passport. Can you bring it to Terminal 2? We’re at Gate 7. ASAP.

I stared at the screen. The same screen I had waited years to see his name on. Hoping he’d text I love you. That he was proud of me. That he saw me.

But now… now all I saw was proof. Proof that even when I was no longer theirs, they still expected me to serve.

I slowly typed my response.

Erika: I don’t want to do it. I’m done being your nanny, Kier. Goodbye.

Then I turned off my phone. I stood, lifted my suitcase, and walked toward Gate 18.

1mmtvsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mmtvsg/how_does_hamilton_beach_the_scoop_coffee_maker/,How does Hamilton Beach The Scoop coffee maker review compare for single-serve brewing?,"Sipping coffee is one of those small daily rituals that keeps me sane. As someone who's tested a good number of coffee makers, I was excited to dive into what the **Hamilton Beach 47620** had to offer. I mean, anything that promises fresh, delicious coffee without pods sounded tailor-made for my morning routine. Plus, as an environmentally conscious coffee drinker, I was intrigued by the effort to nix disposable pods and filters. Here's my honest take on this drip coffee machine after numerous brews and spills.

**Design and Build Quality**  
A first glance at this coffee maker, and it’s clear they’ve gone for a minimal yet functional aesthetic. Decked out in black, the compact build fits snugly on my cluttered kitchen counter. Its dimensions—11 inches wide, 14 inches tall, and 7 inches deep—mean it doesn’t eat up precious space, even in smaller kitchens. The design feels sturdy but lightweight (only about 3 pounds), making it easy to nudge around or clean beneath. The manual operation is refreshingly simple for those who prefer fewer bells and whistles, and the reusable filter doubling as a coffee scoop is genius—no fumbling for extra tools before my cup of morning sanity.

**Eco-Friendly Brewing Experience**  
To be honest, the shift from pods to grounds was something I appreciated on multiple levels. Not only am I saving money by skipping expensive pods, but it’s also a win for the environment. Less plastic in landfills equals a happier planet, and my wallet doesn’t complain either. The permanent filter is durable, easy to rinse, and cuts down on waste compared to paper filters. It’s a subtle change, but stacking up long-term, it’s hard to ignore the financial and ecological benefit.  

**Ease of Use and Intuitive Controls**  
Operating this machine has been an absolute breeze. There's a single, extra-large brew button gracing the coffee maker’s body, and nothing about it is remotely intimidating. I gave it a try on my groggiest weekday morning, and even then, the one-step scoop-and-brew process saved me from pre-caffeinated meltdown. The white LED light indicator is also a nice touch—it reminds me that something magical (read: coffee) is brewing.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 47620 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b94q9wkn/)

**Coffee Quality and Adjustable Size Options**  
This little powerhouse brews a fresh, full-bodied cup in under five minutes. I’ve tried it with everything from basic store-brand grounds to high-end dark roasts, and I wasn’t let down by the taste in either case. Strong, but not bitter—a balance that’s tricky for some coffee makers. The adjustable cup stand? That’s another standout feature. Whether I’m using my trusty 8 oz ceramic mug at home or brewing directly into a 14 oz travel mug before heading out the door, there’s no awkward tilting or splashing. The flexibility is perfect for caffeine habits that change depending on my mood (or level of sleep deprivation).

**Advantages**  
- The reusable scoop-filter is innovative and reduces waste.  
- Compact size ideal for cramped spaces like apartments or offices.  
- Adjustable cup stand accommodates different cup sizes effortlessly.  
- Fantastic coffee quality even for varying roast styles.  

**What Could Be Improved**  
Unfortunately, no product is without a couple of quirks, no matter how great it may be.  
- The coffee maker doesn’t come with an automatic timer—an option I tend to miss when rushing in the mornings.  
- Some users might prefer additional brew strength settings for a more customized cup.  
- During my rigorous testing, I noticed the unit tends to heats up significantly, which might be concerning if placed in a high-traffic area.  

**Competing Products**  
In the world of single-serve brewers, the greatest contenders are often from Keurig and Nespresso. Keurig machines might edge ahead with their quick pod-based system and broader variety of flavored coffee pods, but they lose points on sustainability and cost transparency. Nespresso units, while offering a replicated café experience, come with a heftier price tag and proprietary capsules that limit your coffee options. The Hamilton Beach coffee maker shines in areas these competitors don’t—it’s wallet-friendly, grinds aren’t restricted, and it doesn’t drown you in setup or cleanup time. Honestly, it feels like a no-nonsense alternative for those craving control over their brew without getting bogged down in tech or subscription services.  

**Value for Money**  
Given the practical design, the quality of the coffee, and the eco-consciousness baked into its construction, I’d argue this device is worth every penny. Some pricier machines might come with flashier features like Wi-Fi connectivity or app integration, but if you’re just looking for well-brewed, hassle-free coffee every morning, this one ticks all the right boxes. Plus, investing in grounds over pods means your long-term expenses shrink. Overall, it feels like smart spending, especially for coffee lovers who value simplicity and quality.

1mmtubm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1mmtubm/missing_the_forest_for_the_trees/,Missing the Forest for the Trees,"I thought I had done the work. I took the time, understood the mistakes, and took care of myself. I was ready, but I was more fragile than I thought.

She was my friend. The best friend I could ever have. Someone who not only adored my entire self, but enjoyed the small thrills of life. We climbed mountains together and were inseparable. With every argument, there was growth. Our falling out plays like a tragedy in my mind. Two people so desperately in love that they would sacrifice everything for one another until the floor fell out from under them.  One cannot describe the amount of distress I felt to lose the person I would still die for to another man. I was heartbroken, and felt every emotion one could think of for a year. I took that time to focus on myself and try to understand what I could do differently if love were to ever strike again.

When I met you, it was like the clouds parted finally. Someone who understood me and had travelled down similar but different paths. It felt dangerous and I knew the risks, but I chose to believe people change.

I changed. I continued to date you. I showered you with love and reassurance, even after you told me you had loved me way too soon into the relationship. You were hungry for a life form, and I was a pretty package that had finally stitched together the broken heart. I worked tirelessly to be myself, as well as bring you a full person. I guess that’s why I was so upset at you.

I was never truly mad with my ex wife. We both played a part in what happened. Nobody around us was mad when we split up, just sad. Sad that love can die, sad that all good things truly fall apart. She deserves a happy life, and likely misses parts of me, too. I didn’t expect to forgive her so fully after you and I split, and I bet you are wondering why.

So that’s why I think you deserve an explanation, and why I would like you to even try to make yourself not seem like such an evil person in my eyes.

With everything that happened in Germany, it relates to putting ourselves in harms way. When you are with someone for that long, you change as a human multiple times. Through and through, I was secure in that relationship. She could do whatever she wanted, because no other person could beat me. Boy, was I wrong. When you decide to live in another country, you accept so many changes that are coming your way. We ended up changing in a way that made us fall apart. But her behavior prior to that was not one to be cautious of. The stories of her you heard from other people are not factual, and it does no good for me to correct you on that. She never wanted to hurt me like she did, and I am thankful for the honest conversation she had with me in that coffee shop in Alexanderplatz. It can still haunt me to this day, but it gave me the ability to just be sad, rather than despise her.

You never gave me that. You only gave excuses. I started to realize in March that perhaps you had never healed from a single relationship, and that makes me sad for you. You claimed I had an anger problem, but I could see you reaching out to exes from your past regularly while claiming I was the best thing to ever happen to you. We went to a few therapy sessions where you blatantly exaggerated my part in the arguments, and made the therapist carve out time in the sessions to speak my own mind. I still didn’t get to, because you told her I was suicidal when I was not. It hijacked part of my own healing without you even being there. I couldn’t understand why someone would want to flip the blame on me so badly. I couldn’t understand how someone could lie to the worst person: themselves. And as the months have gone by, I can’t see humans the same. I trusted you, only to see you might be just consuming life forms along the way through trauma bonding and discarding them with a sound reason, when the only reason that is truly there is yourself. Honesty and transparency are both important to me, as well as accountability. At this point, I feel as though you lack all three of those things. And though this probably comes off as angry, these are things I wished I could say to you. Yes, you are correct. We were not meant to be together, and I believe we play in different leagues. Neither is better, but it likely would have been better for you if you had never met me.

You said I am missing the forest for the trees. It is what I feel is the final projection you cast upon me without even realizing it. The night you called me a month and a half ago, drunk, professing your love for me, I upset you by telling you I forgave my ex wife. I forgave her because I realized that she was just being honest with me. It’s the worst thing you could have done to me; that is the forest. It was truly easier to fall in love when I hadn’t forgiven her. I now roam through life looking for connections that could remind me of her, knowing what I lost and will never get again. I have to sever relationships continuously because I can’t feel things for them. I look for truth in good people, but have grown addicted to the chaos that has consumed my romantic life. And I am not mad about feeling like a shell of my former self, it at least protects other people from wasting their time on someone who will always compare them. But I didn’t compare you to her. I thought of you as different, and enjoyed my time for a few months. 

So this is me telling you why I forgave her, and I do hope that you will find it in your heart to be transparent and honest with me one day. Until then, I will be cold, and distant. Hopefully a memory of someone that showed up when you couldn’t. The rebound that could have been safe, even though he didn’t understand that he was a rebound until it was too late. Just to add, it’s  truly liberating to not require another person to feel like yourself, and I hope you find a way to do that. 

Life works mysteriously, and I don’t think you will ever see this. But I am putting this out there to let you know that if you approach me calmly without accusations, I will willingly have a conversation to release my grudge and free you of any guilt you may harbor. I don’t want to hate you, it hurts me to hate anyone. But I truly don’t understand how you can create such a narrative without explanation and worry that I am saying while you are not around. And to have me believe you are not when I heard you cut down every ex before me that you did this same thing to.

1mmttr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/1mmttr6/45_is_still_good_a_self_reminder/,4/5 is STILL good! (a self reminder...),"I set out for the full Dix range yesterday. I camped out at Slide Brook which was an awesome site. Friday evening I took a stroll down to Lillian Brook after I set up camp. I hung out by the brook and filled up my 3 liter water reservoir and 2 1 liter smart Bottles for the next day ahead. I knew it would be hot and no water up top so I figured carrying more is the best option. 

I set out on trail for Macomb about 4 am. Man that felt like a SLOG. I didn't sleep great, but I was still excited for the day attempting the whole range. I started up the slide on the left and I heard some voices, I looked out behind me and WOW!!! The moon was full and glowing with a red haze. I took some pictures which proved to be more challenging while you are trying to keep footing under you lol! 

The voices then turned into three young men eager to pave the wave. I decided to wait to see how they fearlessly maneuvered the slide filled of broken rocks and sand. I hung out with the third of their group a little just chit chatting as we both took our time finding the best footing and likely both a little scared of the whole experience. But we talked about our journeys on the 46. Which ones were our favorite and which ones were our next. It was a fantastic distraction from the insanity of what we were both doing. 

Off the Macomb slide, and WHAT?! WTH is this?! No one talks about the giant slab you have to somehow grapple after your legs are just about completely gassed out trying to keep you alive. Luckily, there is a path to the left. Still steep and some slick mud, but ""easily"" climbedd.

Made it to the top. 3 gentleman now turned 5. I appreciated the view and them talking about their climbs and one making coffee. I loved that for him. 

I decided to exit out and head to South Dix. WOW! What a gorgeous mountain. The views. The climbing. The rock face looks super intimidating, yet you get on and it's incredibly grippy and hand/foot holds everywhere. I'm pretty sure the sole purpose of this mountain is to me a rock climbing playground. It gave a Little Haystack feel as you could create your own climbing adventure and get wowed by all the views in the process. 10/10. 

Got my picture of the S. Dix tag and headed to the lookout so that I could eat a propper snack. Tortillas, sliced cheese, and pepperonis. MMMM! I've learned when I am hiking that I'm NOT hungry. So I have to pack things I'm actually excited to eat. The first three gentlemen come through to the lookout as I was packing up. To hear their excitement of the views makes me feel joy in my soul. As a parent, I can only hope my child at some point has their own adventures with friends in nature. 

Off to Grace! The climb started feeling a little long. And at that point I came out to the summit. Another spectacular summit. This would also be a killer sunrise spot. I'm feeling pretty good. Took some pictures and ready to move. I was a little worried if I sat or dilly dallied the tank would run out. 

Off back to S. Dix again! uggggghhhhhhhh. I'm not sure why, but at this point the hike is feeling like a slog. I met a great group of 4 hikers who seemed to have an awesome fearless leader who was on a mission with a great attitude. They pumped me up! And I trudged on.

When you are back on S. Dix looking at Pough and Hough, a bit of misery set in. WHAT?! Hough is so big and looks SOOOOOOOO far away. Maybe I will just do three. So I did the normal game with myself talking myself through every step of the way. Got to Pough. Check. Got to Lillian Brook trial, check. Checked my map one million times, check. 

I self assessed. It was hot. I was tired and getting a bit cranky. Moreso I was a bit worried about the Beckhorn as it's been looming in my brain all day. So I made a deal with myself if I could get to Hough, THEN I could make a decision on Dix. 

Well, that was a slog and a steep one at that. Not overly technical. There is a big ""beehive"" like rock structure that is intimidating as hell that you come up to. Though, I think it would have been easy enough to climb, I choose to go to the left and bypassed that adventure. As I counted down the elevation to the summit on my GaiaGPS I finally made it to summit. Sat on the rock, got a picture with the yellow tagged tree. 

There I sat and looked at the looming Beckhorn and what seems to be 1 million mile trail to get there. I had just done HaBaSa a few weeks ago with friends (hello, and the backside of Basin?!) and I decided my fear quota was met for the month. I was alone and nervous if I had any trouble that wasn't a spot I needed to have issues at alone. I decided there my mission of 5 was now 4 for the day. 

As I processed bailing on the one, I somehow FORGOT I had just climbed FOUR high peaks and worked my butt off doing it. There was a sense of letting myself down. Luckily my service had dinged in and my best friend was sending me encouraging messages to keep me motivated and reminded me just 3 short years ago was a person saying ""Oh I would NEVER hike high peaks!"" So quickly we forget where we came from. 

I gathered myself back together with another tortilla, cheese, and meat snack. The inspiring group of four met back at the summit. We got to exchange pictures for one another and chitchat about their 46er journeys. People on these mountains never cease to amazing. You could tell they were great friends and enjoy working hard together. What a gift. It made me miss my hiking buddies and I felt an immense amount of gratitude to be able to share this space with others and appreciate all the hard work each and every person is doing on the mountains, whether it was one, two, three, four, five, or even an attempt.

I said goodbye to the quartet of baddies heading off to climb the Beckhorn and Dix, and I journeyed back down Hough. I felt good with my decision of ""bailing"" and I realized that nothing I did was negated by leaving one mountain off of the plan. The fact that even just last Fall I bailed on a WHOLE LOT of mountains, and mostly lower elevation ones because I wasn't conditioned and honed in like I should have been, and now not even 12 months later after conditioning and taking my health seriously, I am capable of doing these climbs with WAY less effort that it was 55 pounds ago. I'm not sure how I did it before with so much extra weight, but I'm grateful it never stopped me because it gives me that much more strength to climb now. 

On to Lillian Brook. I had read terrible things about this trail. It's steep at first FOR SURE. And since it's unmaintained, it's legit hard to navigate. I did slip and fall about 6-8 times, more than I ever had on any other trail. There's a lot of that mud and blow down and hunting to see where the trail went...again and again. It's a slog. But not the worst. I wouldn't want to do it in the dark so I was glad to be heading out with plenty of daylight hours.

When I hit the Lillian Brook and Hunters Pass junction a huge ""Oh thank god"" of relief came flying out. As I set out back to campsite, I met a group of three who we met in the parking lot on Friday. Such nice people from out of state. Their forth person continued on the trail but they turned around on the slide. Rightfully so. If you aren't expecting something like that or if you haven't got a bit of the ADK under your belt, it can be terrifying for sure. We exchanged congrats on each of our journeys knowing that just being out there is awesome. 

Every time I am out in the wilderness, the people I come across just amaze me. What a gift to be able to adventure and push our limits out there. The mountains teach us some much about ourselves. They teach us we can do SOOOO much more than we think we can do. And they also teach us, now it's time to stop. It's a gift of give and take. They also teach we don't have to compare our journeys to others. People come from different places and have different strengths. But we can use the observation of their journeys to inspire our own. 

Happy trials!

1mmtsbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1mmtsbu/my_elderly_neighbour_is_convinced_i_am_trying_to/,My elderly neighbour is convinced I am trying to torture her dog,"Before you start reading, English is not my first language, please excuse any mistakes. 

I normally only read reddit, but I had to vent somewhere so I made an account to post this. 

Me (27F) and my fiancé (28M) moved into our current home about 1,5 years ago. Next door to us lives an elderly woman (80's F) Let's call her Lea (fake name). She seemed nice and we had no trouble with her. Until about a year ago, when we got two cats. Our cats are mostly inside cats but when me or my fiancé are home we let them in the yard. They cannot get out of our yard, it's enclosed for their safety and to make sure they don't hurt other animals or bother our neighbours. It's a small yard, and they are able to get to the fence we share with Lea. (they can't climb over it, they can't reach through it, they can't look through it, but they can walk upto it. 

Lea has a little dog, who she lets in her yard sometimes. The dog starts barking as soon as she smells or hears our cats. When that happens Lea starts yelling and cursing, we don't always know if it's meant for us or her dog or what. It's a little incoherent. As soon as we hear the barking we rush to get the cats inside, but she's usually already screaming by that point. 

I'm not always able to be there immediately because sometimes I wear headphones or I'm in the bathroom etc. I've caught her slamming against the fence and putting the gardenhose on our cats. That time I got mad and yelled that the cats weren't doing anything and that it's dangerous to just soak cats in water like that. She yelled that we are making her home unliveable and that she has never had issues with neighbours until we moved in. 

After I cooled down I felt bad about the situation so me and my fiancé went to talk to Lea. I told her that I'd like to talk it out because I was feeling super stressed about the situation. She said she felt the same and didn't want to fight. Lea told us that she knew we had put three machines in our yard and they bothered her dog. We don't have anything in our yard except two chairs. That is literally it. I told her that and she yelled that I was a liar. I asked her if she wanted to come have a look so she could see that there was nothing there, but she refused saying she saw it with her own eyes. The more I tried to explain that what she thought she saw was impossible, the more she started yelling. At this point I started crying because I can't handle being yelled at without being able to defend myself. 

When she stopped yelling I tried to find a solution, maybe we could make a schedule and I would make sure the cats are inside at those times. Lea didn't want that and said both the cats and her dog should just be able to be outside. She said sometimes she just gets angry and yells but we don't need to think too much of that. I said that's fine, but I don't want her using the hose anymore on the cats. Lea said she would never do that and it must've just happened while she was washing the fence. I clearly saw her holding the hose over the fence while saysing she's ""gonna teach those lil assholes a lesson"". But I decided to just say that it must've been a misunderstanding and I hoped it would be over. 

Now I just quickly get the cats inside as soon as I hear the barking, I thought I kinda learned Lea's schedule so I would keep the cats inside at the times she's normally outside anyway. However now the dog seems to be always there and our cats have almost no time outside. It stresses me out that I have to be on guard at all times, hearing that bark gives me anxiety knowing the yelling will follow. I'm thinking about just keeping the cats inside but they love getting to explore outside and they do nothing wrong so it feels like I'm punishing them for Lea's actions. 

Me and my fiancé have both overheard Lea talking to other neighbours about us. Saying we are terrible people who put sensors in our yard to go off whenever her dog comes outside. I think she might be suffering from some mental problems but I don't like her spreading lies about us to the whole neighbourhood. I hate unresolved issues but I am completely lost on how to fix this. I thought to maybe build like a big cage kinda structure in our yard so the cats really can't go anywhere. But the yard is already only a few square meters big so It feels a bit ridiculous to put a cage in there. Plus it would cost a lot of money and my fiancé doesn't think we should have to spend money when we are not the one that have a problem. I also am afraid if she notices a structure in our yard that she will think it is something else to torture her dog, since she already accuses us of that without anything being there. And maybe it won't even stop the dog from barking. 

She's often in her front yard and loves talking to everyone who walks by. Whenever she talks to us she seems friendly and doesn't mention the back yard issues. I thought she might be lonely so I invited her over for tea or coffee but she refused. She complains a lot about everthing she has to do so I offered help with chores, getting groceries etc. but she refused. I don't want to involve our other neighbours but she's already telling everybody we are horrible people behind our backs. 

This situation gives me so much stress and anxiety, I just have moments where I burst out crying because I don't know how to deal with the situation. I want to be a good neighbour, I want to be the bigger person but how? 

Please does anybody have any advice on how to deal with the situation? My fiancé says I should try not to let her get to me, but I'm the one working from home having to deal with it all the time. ",11,1754859119.0,neighborsfromhell,15,0.87,False
1mmtrg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mmtrg9/the_air_between_the_walls_rework/,The Air Between The Walls (Rework),"**Chapter 1: A Breath of Fresh Air** 

Eliot Greaves stood in the middle of his new living room, the soles of his sneakers grit-squeaking faintly against the polished hardwood. Cardboard boxes surrounded him like a jagged skyline, their flaps gaping open as if gasping for air.

Dust motes swirled lazily in the afternoon light spilling through the tall windows. The beams were warm and gold, but thin, like the light had traveled too far and arrived tired. Eliot followed one mote with his eyes, watching it spiral down… and vanish midair. He frowned.

Everything smelled *new*. Fresh paint clung to the walls in a sharp chemical tang, drywall dust whispered from the corners, and beneath it all lingered the faint sweetness of carpet glue. But under the “new house” smell was something else, faint, damp, and stubborn. Like a basement that had been shut for years.

He wrinkled his nose and crossed to the nearest window. The latch resisted, and when it finally gave with a sharp *clack*, a cool breeze slipped in, brushing against his face. The curtains lifted with a soft *whfff* then dropped, suddenly, as if the air had struck an unseen barrier.

He stood there, waiting for another gust, but the room stayed still. Not just quiet, *still*.

After years in a shoebox apartment above a pawn shop in Boston, Woodmere Lane was supposed to be a reprieve. Back there, the night never ended, music bleeding through paper-thin walls, drunk arguments seeping into his dreams, sirens clawing past the window. Here, the world felt muted. A far-off lawnmower. A single leaf skittering across pavement.

He let out a slow breath, shoulders easing.

No one here knew why he’d left Boston. They didn’t know about the morning he’d stumbled into work shaking so hard his coffee spilled in trembling arcs across his desk, or the tightness in his chest that never truly left. His therapist had called it “burnout” and prescribed “space, fresh air, simplicity.”

When the listing appeared, *Cozy a single-bedroom home in a quiet Maine suburb. Perfect for a fresh start*, he hadn’t hesitated. He’d packed in two days. Crossed three states without glancing at the rearview.

But that first night… something was wrong.

He lay on his bare mattress, staring at the slow spin of the ceiling fan. Sleep wouldn’t come. And then he noticed: there was no sound.

Not the hum of vents. Not the soft rush of air every apartment he’d ever lived in had whispered into the dark. The fan spun lazily, its pull-chain clinking against the glass dome, but he felt no draft on his skin.

He swung his legs off the bed, feet *thup-thup* against the wood, and crossed to the thermostat. The numbers glowed green. Fine. He checked a vent, open.

Kneeling, he pressed his ear to the grate.

Nothing. Not even the faint rattle of ductwork.

Just the sound of his own breathing.

And beneath that, an absence so deep it felt like it was waiting.

**Chapter 2: Welcome to the Neighborhood**

“Mr. Greaves?”

The voice reached him as though it had traveled through insulation, muffled, thickened, softened until it barely felt like sound at all.

Eliot straightened, balancing a box of mismatched kitchenware against his hip. Sweat ran down his spine, soaking the collar of his shirt. The air inside the house pressed against him like a damp cloth, heavier with each hour. The walls seemed to radiate stored heat, as if they’d been holding their breath all day and were now exhaling it into the rooms.

He stepped toward the front door.

On the porch stood a man who could have been carved from the soil itself. His earth-stained flannel hung loose on a narrow frame, sleeves rolled to the elbow. A wide-brimmed straw hat shadowed his face, but not enough to hide the fissure-thin smile. Thin leather gloves covered his hands, the creases smoothed by long use.

“Neighbor,” the man said. His voice was calm but dry, like it had spent too long in disuse. “Name’s Lorne. I live next door.”

Eliot took the offered hand. The skin was cool, unnaturally so for a summer afternoon, and papery, as if the blood had been drained from it.

“Settling in alright?” Lorne asked, but his eyes weren’t on Eliot. They drifted past him into the house, not with the casual interest of a friendly neighbor but with the precision of someone checking a list. He traced the eaves above the porch, then the attic vent, then let his gaze drop along the front steps to the foundation. Each stop lasted a beat too long.

“Trying to,” Eliot said. “The HVAC’s… not really pushing any air.”

Lorne’s smile widened by a fraction. The skin at the corners of his mouth gave a faint, brittle crackle, as though the motion had to break through something. “Ah. Sometimes these old houses forget to breathe.”

He let the words hang, as if they meant more than they should, before a slow, hollow chuckle rolled out, a sound you might hear in the belly of an empty well.

“Come by for tea sometime,” Lorne said. “I don’t get many new neighbors.”

Eliot nodded. Lorne turned and slipped behind the hedge. He didn’t move quickly, but he moved *quietly*, each step landing with an absence of sound that made Eliot wonder if he’d imagined the whole visit.

That night, the silence of the house returned in full. The white noise machine by his bed filled the room with a steady shhhhhhh, but under it, low, deliberate, came a sound from inside the wall.

*Scrrrrp… scrrrrp…*

It wasn’t the frantic scamper of mice. It wasn’t wood settling. It was too slow. Too patient.

He turned the volume up. Buried his face in the pillow.

Through the hiss, through the pulse in his ears, something else slipped in, so close it felt like it was pressed against the other side of the wall:

A single breath. Wet. Deep. Slow.

**Chapter 3: The Walls Know You’re Alone (Reworked)**

Three weeks passed. Eliot tried to force the days into a rhythm: wake, work, eat, sleep, but the house seemed determined to erode anything resembling normal.

It was the air. Always the air.

The vents stayed mute, as though plugged with something soft and patient. Even with the windows propped wide, a breeze would push into the room only to falter halfway, collapsing like a lung giving up mid-breath.

He bought dehumidifiers. Fans. Air purifiers. He filled the rooms with the constant *whrrrrrrr* of machinery, each device standing like a little sentry against the unseen, but the air never changed. It remained heavy. Close. A texture you could almost feel against your skin, clinging in a way that felt deliberate. Watching him.

Then came the pressure.

Not sound, feeling. A subtle weight pressing across his chest, a presence that wasn’t there when he left the house but always returned with him, settling in before he’d even closed the door.

Some nights, walking the hallway, he swore the walls leaned in ever so slightly. One morning, he measured it: ten feet, two inches from wall to wall. That night, on a restless impulse, he measured again, ten feet, one and three-quarters. Only a quarter inch, but it was there, and the tape measure didn’t lie.

Sleep became labor. He would wake in the dark with his lungs aching, his hands clawing at the air as if he could physically tear away something covering his face.

One night, unable to shake the feeling that the house was holding its breath alongside him, he stumbled into the bathroom and flicked on the light.

A plastic bag lay in the sink. Thin. Damp.

He didn’t own plastic bags.

Faint, smeared fingerprints tracked across the cloudy surface, five uneven impressions where someone had gripped it tight enough to stretch the material into pale streaks. He lifted it gingerly, the plastic whispering against itself, and felt the residual heat trapped inside.

He took it to the police. The officer at the desk was polite but uninterested. No forced entry. Probably misplaced trash.

“Or stress,” the man offered with a practiced smile. “Moving can play tricks on the nerves.”

Eliot went home, the bag still in its evidence envelope, and started drinking more. Sleeping pills followed.

But the dreams were worse.

In them, the walls moved, not collapsing but breathing. *Whump… whump…* slow and steady, like the steady pulse of something enormous sleeping around him. The ceiling would dip lower with each exhale, just enough for him to feel the faint pressure of air against his face, as if it might kiss his forehead before settling into his lungs.

Rooms warped in slow, dizzying rotations. Hallways bent into impossible angles. Doors opened to nowhere.

And always, always, that voice. Breathless and close enough to brush the shell of his ear:

*Breathe. Just breathe. Until you can’t.*

**Chapter 4: Ventilation (Reworked)**

The HVAC technician arrived on a too-bright Thursday morning, a clipboard in one hand and a Styrofoam coffee cup in the other. His van idled at the curb, the low *hrmmm* of the engine filling the otherwise empty street like background noise in a dream.

“Shouldn’t take me long,” he said, stepping over the threshold without looking Eliot in the eye. His boots left faint, dusty prints on the floorboards, each one crisp-edged in the filtered sunlight that felt thinner than it should have been.

Eliot hovered in the doorway while the man tested the thermostat, disappeared into the basement, and clambered into the attic. The house seemed to swallow his movements, tools clanking above the ceiling, the muffled scrape of a ladder, a single cough echoing through the ductwork like something trying to find its way out.

After nearly an hour, the tech emerged from the attic hatch, skin damp with sweat, wiping his forehead with the back of his wrist.

“Nothing wrong,” he said. “System’s fine. Air pressure’s normal. It’s moving, you just can’t feel it.”

Eliot frowned. “How’s that possible?”

The man shrugged, eyes sliding past Eliot to the shadowed hallway behind him. “Old houses. Sometimes you get weird flow patterns. Dead spots. But the machine’s doing what it’s supposed to.”

He made for the door, but paused at the threshold with one boot on the porch, glancing back as though something had occurred to him in that moment.

“Doesn’t feel right in there, though.” He said it like someone making an offhand comment about peeling paint, but didn’t wait for an answer. The van’s engine faded down the street until the silence came rushing back in.

That night, Eliot lay in bed staring at the dark ceiling, the quiet pressing down on him like a second blanket.

And then, without warning, the stillness broke.

Not with sound, but with sensation.

The air moved.

It wasn’t a breeze. It wasn’t wind. It was a draw, deliberate and deep, as if the room itself were inhaling. The pull teased at his hair, lifted the hem of his shirt just enough for the fine hairs on his stomach to stand. His chest tightened as though his own lungs were syncing with the movement.

The pull stopped.

Then came the exhale, slow, moist, and faintly metallic, like breath that had passed through rust.

Eliot’s heart pounded. He sat up, eyes darting to the vent above his dresser. The metal grille glistened as though it had been sweating. Thin beads of condensation traced the slats and dripped to the carpet with soft, deliberate ticks.

He slid out of bed and crossed the room, muscles rigid, one finger reaching toward the vent.

It was warm.

From within, something shifted. Not the skitter of a mouse, but a heavier, slower movement. Something that knew it had been touched.

**Chapter 5: Lorne’s Warning** 

Two days later, Lorne came back.

No knock this time. No cheery call from the porch. Just the faint, deliberate **clmp, clmp, clmp** of boots on the wooden boards outside, each step heavy enough to sound like it carried more than his own weight. The sound stopped right outside the door.

Eliot opened it to find Lorne standing there, hat low over his brow, shoulders squared against a heatless wind. His skin looked more sallow than before, and his gray eyes, sharp, colorless, were fixed not on Eliot’s face, but somewhere deeper.

“You’ve been keeping the windows open,” Lorne said. His voice was flat. Not accusing. Not friendly. Just stating the fact like it was carved in stone.

Eliot blinked, thrown. “It’s summer.”

“You shouldn’t.” The words didn’t rise or fall, but there was a strange weight in them, as though each one carried something unspoken. Lorne’s eyes finally met his, and Eliot felt the same quiet evaluation he had when they first met, a measuring of worth, of whether Eliot was someone who needed the truth… or could survive it.

Eliot’s throat was suddenly dry. “Why?”

Lorne’s gaze drifted upward, following the line of the porch beam, tracing along the roofline the same way he had the first time. His eyes lingered at the eaves like there was something alive up there, something patient.

“Some houses,” he said at last, his voice quieter now, “they learn you. Learn your rhythm. You open a window, they’ll find their way in faster.”

Eliot’s stomach tightened. “…They?”

Lorne’s lips pressed into a thin line. He didn’t answer. Instead, after a pause that seemed to stretch far too long, he murmured, “Close them. Before nightfall.”

And then he turned, boots thudding once more against the porch, the sound fading into the strange stillness that followed him.

That night, Eliot obeyed.

He went room to room, pulling every window shut until the locks clicked. The glass felt faintly warm against his fingertips, like it had been holding someone’s breath. He drew the curtains tight, checked them twice before bed, then once more for good measure.

The house seemed quieter with everything sealed, too quiet. The silence had a weight to it, like the air in the rooms was waiting for something.

Somewhere after midnight, it came.

A faint pull, subtle at first. The air seemed to slip across his face like a passing shadow. Then it grew stronger, an invisible draw that tugged at him as though the whole house were inhaling.

The blanket lifted at the corner, shifting against his legs.

And then it pressed. Not the blanket, **the air itself**, settling against his mouth and nose, dense and heavy, like trying to breathe through damp wool.

Eliot jolted upright, tearing in a gasp. The blanket slid limply into his lap, but the weight in the air lingered for a breath longer before retreating.

Across the room, the curtain swelled outward, slow and deliberate, as though something inside the house had exhaled toward the glass… testing the locks.

**Chapter 6: The Crawlspace and the Voice**

Eliot woke to heat.

Not warmth, heat. Stagnant, clinging, heavy enough that it felt like it was pressing down on his chest. The air in his room had stopped again, thick and unmoving, the kind that tasted faintly metallic when you breathed it in. Sweat slicked his back, ran in cold streams down his ribs.

He swung his legs over the bed and stood, bare feet sticking slightly to the floorboards. The silence was complete, no hum of the refrigerator, no creak of settling wood, no distant whoosh from the vents. His lungs already ached for something fresher.

He stepped into the hallway.

It wasn’t his hallway anymore.

What should have been a short ten-foot stretch now ran on and on, swallowed in flickering light. The walls seemed to lean inward as he walked, the shadows stretching unnaturally far, like he was moving into the throat of something alive.

With each step, the carpet changed under him, soft to rough, then to bare concrete. The air thinned. His breaths came shallower, faster, his body working harder to get less.

Eliot reached out for the wall to steady himself.

It pulsed.

The drywall gave under his palm as if a slow heartbeat pushed from inside. He snatched his hand back, then pressed it again, needing to be sure, and felt it shift. Like something was crawling along the inside, dragging itself toward him.

He dropped to his knees and pulled himself forward, dizzy, crawling now because standing felt like too much work. His shoulders scraped the narrowing walls until he could barely move without turning sideways. The air was so thin it made his teeth ache.

Finally, he saw a door. His bedroom door.

He pushed it open and found only blackness beyond.

The dark wasn’t empty. It had weight, pulling his gaze in. Somewhere inside it, a voice spoke, slow and patient:

“Come further. There’s more air in the quiet. You only have to give up your shape.”

Eliot slammed the door and fell back, gasping.

When he dared to open it again, the hallway was back to normal length. Carpet plush. Walls straight. Furniture in place.

But the silence was still there, deep and deliberate.

He turned on every light, checked every wall, opened every door, half expecting to see that endless corridor again. But he knew it didn’t need to appear.

The house was already changing him.

And somewhere inside the walls, something was waiting.

**Chapter 7: The Final Inch**

By morning, Eliot knew, he had to leave.

He hadn’t slept after the hallway. Every time he closed his eyes, he felt the air pressing down on him, like the ceiling had lowered by an inch.

He stuffed clothes into a duffel, tossed his laptop and papers into the backseat of the car. His hands shook, not from fear, at least not the kind you could name, but from the sense that something was counting his movements. Measuring him.

He turned the key.

Nothing.

Not the grinding cough of a bad engine, nothing. Dead silence. He checked the battery. Fine. Fuel gauge, fine. The car just wouldn’t turn over, as if it had decided the same thing the house had: Eliot wasn’t leaving.

He jogged back inside to grab his phone and stopped dead.

The windows were gone.

Not boarded. Not covered. Gone. Smooth walls where the glass should be. No seams. No light from outside. No sound of passing cars, or wind, or birds. Just an unbroken shell.

Panic rose sharply and immediately in his throat. He rushed to the front door, gripped the knob hard enough to hurt his hand. It didn’t turn. Not locked, sealed.

He rammed his shoulder against it. Nothing.

Grabbing the nearest chair, he smashed it into the drywall beside the frame. The plaster gave way, but behind it was solid concrete, cold and smooth. As if the house had filled its bones while he slept.

The air grew hotter. Denser. His chest tightened in sharp, stabbing increments with each breath.

He thought of the basement. Maybe there was a hatch, a window, something.

He took the stairs two at a time, but when he reached the bottom, the air was worse. Thick and damp, clinging to his skin. In the far corner, under the low-hanging pipes, sat something that froze him in place.

A wooden box. Four feet long. Screws half-driven in along the lid. The grain was raw, unfinished, splinters sticking up like teeth.

He stepped closer, every sound muffled now by the heat in his ears.

Inside, through a narrow gap, he could see the lining, padded, covered in mirrored glass. A small oxygen monitor sat in the corner, its green light steady.

And on top, a voice recorder.

“This is for you, Eliot. I made it. With love.”

The voice behind him answered the rest.

He turned.

Lorne stood there. Taller now, wrong in a way Eliot’s mind couldn’t arrange into sense. Fingers too long, eyes black and wet as if they were always mid-blink.

“I told you,” Lorne whispered, stepping forward. “You never really understand air until it’s all you’re missing.”

Eliot moved to run, but Lorne’s hand shot up, pressing a cloth to his face.

Something sharp and chemical flooded his nose and mouth, cutting through the already starved air. His knees buckled.

The last thing he felt was Lorne’s breath, slow and steady, brushing his ear.

**Chapter 8: Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.**

Eliot woke in darkness.

No, worse than darkness. A *weight* over his eyes, as though the air itself had thickened into something tangible, pressing down against his face.

His hands moved first, fumbling upward, wood met his palms. Close. Just inches above him.

A box.

The smell hit next: varnish and sweat and something faintly metallic, like the taste of a bitten lip.

He pushed, but the lid didn’t give. It didn’t even rattle. Every shove just sent the air inside trembling against his skin, a reminder of how little of it there was.

He blinked, and the darkness shifted. No, it reflected.

The walls weren’t solid wood. They were lined in mirrors. Thin, warped glass that threw his face back at him from every angle. His eyes looked too wide, his mouth already opening and closing in desperate rhythm. He could see the veins in his neck pulsing.

A green light in the corner, oxygen monitor. Numbers already slipping.

He drew in a breath. It was like pulling air through a straw buried in wet sand.

The recorder clicked on.

“Breathe in,” Lorne’s voice said, calm, warm. “That’s it. Slowly. Good boy. Now hold it.”

Eliot tried to scream, but the sound went nowhere, swallowed by the mirrored walls, fed back into his ears like a whisper.

The mirrors weren’t still. When he pressed his hands to them, they seemed to flex inward, the cold giving way to something softer. Something that pressed back. He felt the shape of fingers, longer than his, curling against his palms from the other side.

Panic burned through him. His chest spasmed, sucking in another shallow, useless gulp.

He clawed at the glass until his nails split, but the mirrors only shimmered under his touch, his own reflection gasping and twisting with each futile breath.

No air. No way out.

Outside the box, somewhere beyond the wood and glass, the house exhaled, a deep, shuddering sigh, like a body settling after a long meal.

Eliot’s vision narrowed to a tunnel, his own heaving face shrinking inside it.

One last breath.

One last shape of air in his chest.

And then, nothing.

**Epilogue: The House Still Breathes**

Three months later, 31 Woodmere Lane was back on the market.

The listing was short: ""Cozy one-bedroom starter home. Minor cosmetic repairs. Motivated seller. Move-in ready."" No mention of the missing windows, or the concrete behind the walls, or the last owner whose name still sat in the sheriff’s file under Missing Persons.

The price was low enough to make people stop asking questions.

A young couple from Massachusetts signed the papers before they even toured it twice. On a bright Tuesday morning, they carried boxes inside, laughing, music spilling from a small speaker on the kitchen counter.

They didn’t ask about Eliot. There was no one to ask.

The first few weeks, everything seemed perfect. Too perfect. The rooms always felt sealed against outside noise. Not muffled, sealed. When they spoke, their voices seemed to take just a fraction too long to reach each other, like the words had to push through something unseen.

By December, they’d started sleeping with the windows open. The wife told a friend she thought the air inside felt “used.” She laughed when she said it, but didn’t laugh again when she caught her husband standing in the bathroom mirror, breathing slow and steady, even though his breath didn’t fog the glass.

The home inspector had once told a colleague, “I swear this place is airtight. But somehow, it always smells… warm.” He never came back.

Some nights, the couple hears faint scraping behind the drywall. Not rodents. Not pipes. Something slower.

A rhythm.

Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.

It moves from room to room. Always just behind the wall. Always just one breath behind.

The air between the walls remembers you.

It waits.

And it’s never full.

1mmtqfs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmtqfs,BIG Alkemia July Sale Post!!!,"I'm a bit late to the game as I wanted to give these scents some time to rest. I also sampled them over the course of a couple weeks as to not make myself go noseblind.

Alkemia is my absolute favorite house, so y'all know I had to go a little crazy during the sale. I did make a few orders rather than just one HUGE one as more stuff was released.

Overall, I've never had an issue with Alkemia. Their shipping is always quick, they're always super helpful when I have questions. No complaints there!!

Now onto the reviews... I've split them up into categories as theres just so many.

🦇🦇🦇

🌙DISCONTINUED SCENTS/RARITIES🌙

Madam Pearl (White tea leaves on fine bone china, a parchment letter from a mysterious stranger, a menage a trois of elegant vanillas,  and a piquant pinch of aphrodisiac white pepper)

* Right off the bat, this is as good as it gets. Madam Pearl is my favorite perfume of this sale haul. I originally grabbed it because I saw so much praise surrounding this scent, and I was not disappointed! Madam Pearl starts off sharp and clean like a shiny cup of tea with lots of lemon. Its unbelievably bright! As it dries, it starts to soften. The sharp lemon fades into the background, and a powdery vanilla starts to take the spotlight. That being said, this perfume doesn't go foody. It's not super sweet and keeps it's sparkly clean feel. I wore this perfume one time before I ordered a back-up bottle. It's SO PRETTY!!!!

Bonfire Toffees (A mischievous blend of bonfire toffees, treacle tarts, and dark oudwood steeped in the smoke from a raging bonfire)

* Smoke and Mirrors was my introduction to Alkemia. It's what made me absolutely fall in LOVE with this house! Bonfire Toffees is incredibly similar. Just take the vanilla of Smoke and Mirrors and replace it with a sticky sweet toffee and voila! The only downside is that Alkemia's amazing and realistic campfire smoke note goes metallic on me, and I'm so upset at that!! I will be trying this scent out again once it cools down outside as the unbearable heat right now may be making the smoke go metallic-y rather than my skin chemistry. Fingers crossed, cause this perfume smells SO GOOD!!!

Psychedelique (A hypnotic, narcotic, and diabolically erotic blend of Nag Champa incense, dark spiced rum, black amber, opium, laudanum, hashish, with a raunchy splash of sexy patchouli)

* This is incredibly similar to Hippie Spirit... luckily, Hippie Spirit is my favorite perfume and my signature scent from Alkemia! I'm bound to love it based on that alone, of course. That being said, Psychedelique has more prominent (non-foody) sweet, almost floral notes and a stronger smoke note. It smells so perfectly like a crystal/hippie/head shop, and the nag champa is STRONG!!! I think Hippie Spirit may have slightly better throw and longevity, however I can still smell Psychedelique on my shirt collar after 14 hours. I'm such a sucker for Alkemia's incense it's just sooo good every time!

Krampus (A dark smudge of holiday naughtiness.... well worn leather whips and smouldering black coal)

* This smells exactly how it is described. It opens with a STRONG smoky burning coal smell... and this isn't just your general smoke note, this thing smells like a freshly opened bag of coal. It also smells like a brand new polished leather belt. I'm talking real leather. The two note description is simple, but this thing is so so so interesting. The overpowering wave of bitter smoke settles after a few minutes into a sweeter bonfire-esque smell. The leather stays strong throughout. If you like smoke notes (like me, I LOVEEE them), this is a super fun scent to try!!

De Herba Sanctissma (A sensual reverie of purple cannabis flower accord, frangipani blossoms, vanilla beans, black currant, star anise, pekoe tea, vetiver root, galangal, black opium, patchouli incense, tonka bean, and Atlas cedar)

* I took a leap and blind bought a bottle of this because it was heavily discounted... and I'm likely gonna turn around and sell it again. It's a very well put together scent. It's not a bad perfume by any means, but it's very cannabis heavy, and I can't say I'm the biggest fan of that. It's not skunky, though! It absolutely comes across as clean and pretty green, but it's got that recognizable cannabis smell for sure. Even if it's not for me, I can see someone loving it.

🌙ARCANUM EXPERIMENTS🌙

Experiment 9, aka Cherry Bombe (An explosion of all things cherry - black cherries, cherry pie, cherry cola, chocolate covered cherries, cherry nougat, and candy cherry balls)

* Surprise surprise, this thing is a cherry bomb. Right out of the bottle, you get that artificial cherry scent that everyone knows. As it settles, the other notes start to show up and cut that cherry a bit. The chocolate from the chocolate cherries, the pie crust from the cherry pie, and the nougat all start to give the cherry a bit of depth. Once dry, this perfume isn't really a fake candy cherry scent anymore. It has tons of layers, and the cherry settles to something more realistic and wearable.

Experiment 11, aka Let’s Give’em Pumpkin to Talk About (Homemade pumpkin pie, candied apples, pear frangipani tart, and warm autumn spices)

* This reminds me of pumpkin forward fall candles, but throw some butter in there just cause. Its got the spices, it's got the pumpkin, the apple and pear aren't as clear, but they're there somewhat. Kind of a general fall pumpkin scent. The dry-down is better than the initial smell of the bottle, I might add.

Experiment 15, aka Bad Decisions Make Good Stories (The scent of bad decisions and regrettable choices - skanky dive bars, illicit trysts in afterhours alleyways, and indolic floral perfume mixed with sweat)

* In the bottle and before dry-down, this perfume smells like a nice, soft floral perfume. Don't let it fool you. Once its dry, the animalics (assuming they're used for the sweat and such in this perfume) start to creep in. Alkemia's animalics are very realistic to my nose. They truly are very animal-like and funky. That being said, this perfume is overall still very nice! The animalics hide in the background and eventually fade, so unless youre intentionally searching for them, you may not even notice them. I think the blend of this perfume ultimately ends up a sexy and slightly dirty and promiscuous ""perfume-y"" floral.

Experiment 6 (2023) (Soft white florals, juicy pears, spring violets, clover honey, white patchouli)

* This is just a pretty perfume overall. Nothing too strange about it. Its floral and feminine and bright, and it doesnt come off as fruity to me. Very wearable for the average person! Not much else to say, honestly.

🌙ALCHEMIES🌙

Amethyst Alchemy (A succulently purple blend of wild blackberries and black raspberries, Royal Velvet lavender, almond blossoms, sensual musk, and warm sandalwood)

* The mix of the berry notes with the lavender (I think thats what I'm smelling?) gives off a freshly laundered berry vibe... almost like you washed clothes and forgot about the pack of gummy candy in your pocket. As it dries down, the florals back off and the berries get a bit more tart. It's a good raspberry/blackberry scent, but don't expect natural and earthy berries.

🌙SAMPLE PACK (CURRENT CATALOG)🌙

Cosmic Lotus (A holy trinity of sacred incense, Egyptian musk, and fully blooming lotus flowers)

* This is a brighter, almost watery take on Alkemia's incense note. It does have a bit of soapiness (its rare for me to get soapiness from Alkemia, I'm one of those that doesn't often pick up on it), but it's still good. I am a fan of their stronger, smoker incense a bit more, though. Cosmic Lotus is a great choice if you don't want something crazy overpowering, but still want a really pretty incense.

Lola (A dramatic splash of Coca-cola trailed by an adoration of blood orange, pink peppercorns, caviar lime, orange blossom, tonka, spicy nutmeg dancing sinuously across a base of warm Brazilian cherrywood)

* This truly does smell so much like Coca-cola!! It's got a very accurate fizziness too! Almost like the perfume itself is carbonated. As the Coke note dries down, I'm able to catch the spiciness and woody notes. The orange is definitely there too, but I feel like it blends in with the Coke a bit. Very unique scent!! I always love a carbonated note like that, they're always super fun!

Patchouli Amour (A connoisseur’s blend of three patchoulis – a dark and musk-earthy copper distilled aged patchouli; a green but slightly balsamic young patchouli; and a warm light amber patchouli all blended together with touch of agarwood)

* You guys will never believe this... it's a patchouli bomb. Jokes aside, this is a very earthy and almost minty patchouli scent! It's still hippie-ish, but definitely cooler than my other hippie scents. As it dries, the mint-like notes tone down and make way for an overall earthier smell.

Winter Sanctuary (The velvety warmth of a fireside cuddle - creamy skin musks wrapped in a sensual blanket of softly spiced Feuille de Vanille and delicate kisses of ginger mint, French lavender, and dried Somali rose petals)

* Still wet, I get bubblegum, and I could not even begin to tell you why. Maybe theres a sugar note in there that reads as bubblegum? Thing is, I absolutely love it! As it dries down, the spices start to come through. It's a very Christmas-y blend of spices. Warm cinnamon, nutmeg, those types. I get the ginger too, but I really don't get any florals. I don't mind that, though. I really love how cozy this perfume is!!

Cidre d' Automne (Freshly pressed heirloom varietal fall apples delicately blended with subtle autumnal spices)

* YUMMM!! This is absolutely just fall spiced apples! It does absolutely come off as fall apple candles rather than a genuine bowl of baked cinnamon apples, but it's still so good regardless. I am SO EXCITED to wear this around when the weather cools down, it's amazingggg!!! Definitely one of my favorite fall scents in my collection thus far!

🌙FREEBIES🌙

Alchemy of Desire (A scandalously sexy blend of sultry jasmine, gardenia, rose, heliotrope, carnation, rosewood, and musk)

* This is SUCH a pretty floral!!! I get the rose, of course, but I feel like I'm also smelling magnolia and honeysuckle despite them not being listed. Alkemia always has very very realistic florals and this is no exception. It smells like an entire bouquet of the freshest flowers you could get! I am incredibly happy with this, and I'm so glad it was the freebie alchemy at the time of my order!

Aldéhydes Layering Note (Perfume aroma molecules that add a clean, sparkly element to perfumes)

* This was a total surprise to me. Not only was I not expecting a 5ml freebie, but I've also never even considered this note. It's not one I look for, and if you had asked me to describe what this note even was, I wouldn't have been able to tell you. Imagine my surprise when I actually love it!! This is pure soap bubbles! It smells like a bubble bath! I'm not entirely sure what I'd layer it with, but I'm not against wearing it on it's own either. It smells very clean, so putting some on fresh out of a shower doesn't seem like a bad idea!

The First Dandelion (A bright meadow of sunny dandelion flowers, green dandelion leaves, and warm dirt)

* I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Alkemia's earthy scents are on another level!! How does someone manage to capture the scent of yellow dandelions?? That's such a specific scent and they NAILED it! I also get the surrounding grass, the damp dirt, just the nostalgia of playing outside. I don't typically shoot for those realistic earthy scents just because I get tired of the overwhelming natural smell throughout the day, but this one may be an exception. Very nice!!!

Rondeaux d'Amour (Black plum, spicy saffron, jasmine sambac, orris root, dark red roses, sexy golden amber, vanilla incense, slightly dirty patchouli, and botanical pheromones)

* This perfume is very fruity, but not in the bright way. It's moody and a bit tart from the plum, but not sour if that makes sense. It almost reminds me of Cherries of the Night, just with plum rather than cherries... it's got that same darkness to it. The florals don't overpower at all. I do catch the incense, but its not enough to be smoke heavy. Some perfumes just come off as sexy and this is absolutely one of them!

Scarlet Kiss (A luscious embrace of ripe wild strawberries and tangy red rhubarb, sensually entwined with cream musk and fresh white tea leaves)

* The strawberry in this is the most powerful note by far. The moment I popped open the sample cap, all I got was strawberry. As it settles, the tea leaves start to show up. This scent reminds me almost of a strawberry shampoo? But not a kids one, like a strawberry scented Pantene or Herbal Essences or something. Overall, very pretty, very wearable!!

As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved (Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf)

* AAA This is beautiful!!! I've been wanting to try this scent for the LONGEST TIMEEE, and it's exactly what I wanted it to be! It's sort of fizzy in the way that Lola's coca cola note was! It's dark and almost reminds me of a head shop, but not in the floral-y nag champa way. It's a bit sweet, a bit incense-y, a bit leathery, a bit smoky. It's just so intricate and perfect!!

Persian Tea Room (Spiced black tea, dry desert sand, and Silk Road spices infused with the sensual promise of enticing musk and a flirtatious kiss of soft leather)

* Alkemia's ""silk road spices"" note is incredibly recognizable, and it seems like this is mainly that note. It's a spicy, desert-y spice mix that isn't very sweet at all. I find it to be pretty unique actually! The only other perfume I have with the silk road spices is L'Encens a la Vanille, and this smells very similar in my opinion.

🌙MISCELLANEOUS🌙

Mystery Scent

* I KNEW this would happen. I knew I'd get the mystery bottle, love it, and immediately want to know what it is. This smells like straight up cinnamon. I'm talking scented Christmas pinecones level. Like sniffing a cinnamon stick straight up. Could it be gingerbread alchemy? Is gingerbread alchemy that spicy? Do they have a cinnamon single note? Its so spicy it burns my nose a bit, but it's DELICIOUS!!!

🦇🦇🦇

Overall, I'm very happy with the scents I got!! A couple I will be detashing, but a majority I've already been wearing out! Alkemia has always been good to me, though, so thats no surprise.",33,1754858995.0,Indiemakeupandmore,8,0.97,False

1mmtlzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1mmtlzk/how_to_deal_with_a_lying_manipulative_coworker/,"How to deal with a lying, manipulative coworker","So I work in a medium sized company (about 175 people) and one woman I work with has been intentionally been making up rumours that can actually be very harmful to the people they are about.  These are a few of her lies

-Claimed that our CEO slept his was to the top (while he did marry into the family that owns the company, he’s actually a good guy and worked his way up to that position)

-Stated she got black out drunk with another coworker on a business trip when in fact this other coworker is a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for around 20 years I think
(She is not aware that he is sober)

-Claimed a person in another dept from ours was hitting on her (he’s like 25 years her senior) and when in fact he was just being nice to her because she was in a terrible relationship at the time and would help her out by buying her lunch and bringing it into work for her.  She even so much as told this to his adult stepchildren.  

I’m pretty sure that she makes up these rumours to get attention and she is very much a pick me girl.  But now she has started something new…excluding me from everything.  When we do coffee runs, company lunches etc, she always tells everyone that she’ll let me know and when I don’t show up or pitch in the coffee orders, she just claims I wasn’t interested and I only just started finding out about it this past week when another coworker asked why I never participate in any of these things.  It turns out, everyone stopped including me because I haven’t partook in some time and they just think I’m not at all interested, which is not the case at all and this woman made it seem this way.  

I only work with a small amount of women but a lot of men and she apparently has been doing this to a few other women as well.  I should also mention ages in this for a bit of context.  I’m an early millennial and she is an older gen z. 

I guess I’m not looking for much on advice, just really needed to vent.  Thank you for your time

1mmtkvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mmtkvx/nightingale_floors/,Nightingale Floors,"I agreed to watch my son's house for him while he was away on a trip in Japan. He moved out about two years ago after getting a well paying tech job with some big computer company. In that time he's been able to save up some money to go on this trip he's always wanted to do. Every kid has their special interests, well I guess my son's special interest is anything Japanese. He's been obsessed with anime and katanas, and things of that nature since he was a young teenager. I guess it could be worse. I always thought it was weird, but he's not hurting anyone and it makes him happy.

I pulled up to his driveway and noticed that his car was already gone. I assumed he would be there to greet me and say goodbye, but I guess now he's too old to even give me a hug before leaving. I walked up some concrete stairs to get to his unkempt porch and open the front door. As I walked in I saw a handwritten note sitting on the dining table, obviously meant to catch the attention of anyone coming in through the front door.

""Did some home improvement. Ever heard of nightingale floors? They're big in Japan.""

I read the note and pondered what that could even mean. My son is by no means a handyman, so whatever he's done must be fairly simple. The house wasn't obviously changed in any discernible way when standing just inside the door. I put the note down and decided that I'd find it when I find it. I started walking further into the house and noticed that every single step make a creaking noise. At first I thought the place just had an especially squeaky floor, until I realized every room in the house had this problem, except the basement. In the basement I found his DIY work. Nails and hinges had been screwed to the floor planks and beams in a way that makes them rub against each other and make this metallic squeaking. I sighed and figured I could put up with it for just a week. It was getting late so I headed back upstairs to the living room to watch some TV. The living room was decorated with a bunch of figures and posters of anime characters, none of which I recognized. It seemed childish to me, but I'm not about to tell my son how to spend his money.

Before sitting down, I looked all around for a coffee maker. No coffee pot or Keurig machine, but there were plenty of energy drinks in the fridge. I decided to pass on them and instead just went to bed in the guest room. The guest room was more ""normally"" decorated, just some rather boring white wallpaper and the same grey carpet that every other room had. As I lay in the twin bed that was entirely too small, I thought about how weird this place is. I would never decorate my house with a bunch of toys as a grown man. Then something more important came to the forefront of my mind. I couldn't remember If I locked the front door after coming in. I got out of bed and went to check, the creaking of the floors followed me all the way. I pressed down on the handle and sure enough the door was locked. It was then that I realized something else; there were no keys on the table for me when I arrived, and I've yet to find any. That meant I couldn't lock the doors If I had to go somewhere.

I went back to bed for the night, and I won't lie, walking the long dark hallway back to the bedroom with creaky floors was still unnerving even as a grown man. The light switch was outside the bedroom door, so I had to walk a little ways in a pitch black hallway seeing as all the other lights were off as well. When I woke up early the next day I quickly realized that there wasn't much to eat in the fridge; I would have to go out for groceries. As I stepped onto the porch getting ready to go to the store I hesitated leaving seeing as the house would have to be unlocked for the time being. I rationalized that, at most, I'll only be gone an hour. So I gave in and decided to just leave the house unlocked — it's not like I had any other option.

When I returned, I piled the bags onto the kitchen counter until the car was empty, and then set to actually putting them away. Something bothered me though. When I brought the first load inside, the first few steps into the house make squeaking noises like usual, but they sounded a little different. They sounded almost as if they weren't squeaking right under me, but instead in the living room. The living room and kitchen are separated by a wall and two arch doorways, so I guess it isn't crazy to think some sections of the floors share beams under the floors. I unloaded the rest of the bags from the car and that weird squeak from the other room only seemed to happen on the first trip. I guess I stepped on a plank in just the right way to make it do that.

I spent the rest of the day doing nothing too interesting. I researched nightingale floors in this time, apparently they were used in palaces and temples to protect against ninjas, though they didn't even design the floors to do that on purpose. As it got later, I put a frozen pizza in the oven and got a Starbucks ice coffee out of the fridge to drink while I watch some TV. I went to bed at about 10:00 PM and reluctantly shut off all the lights and marched down that black hallway with my only working sense being my hearing. I could see nothing, but seemingly hear everything, especially each and every creak of the floor. When I got to the guest room I was relieved to be able to turn a light on and see again. I guess we never grow out of being scared of the dark. I closed the door behind me as I left the hallway and just laid in bed with the lights on for a few minutes. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that If something WAS in the dark, then I'd know because of the floors. Then I felt a little silly for being scared. If anything I should be less scared in the dark with these floors.

I shut the light off and tried to get some sleep. Eventually I awoke and had to use the bathroom. I didn't bother to turn on the light as to not bother my eyes. As I got up out of bed I bumped into something before running my hand on the wall to find the door handle. The bathroom was almost in the dead middle of the hallway between the guest room and the living room. I felt along the wall until I grabbed the handle and entered the bathroom. The bathroom had a little nightlight plugged into the wall inside it. I sat down to do my business, staring into the large mirror that stretched from about sitting-eye-level to almost the ceiling. As I sat on the toilet, I had a thought: the first time I entered the house, the floorboards right in front of the door didn't squeak. In fact, I could only remember them squeaking one time ever, and even then, the sound came from the living room, not the kitchen. I began to creep myself out with my own thoughts, and regretted not turning all of the lights on when I woke up. It was then that I heard one singular creak outside in the hallway, and my blood ran cold as I asked myself a question.

What did I bump into?

The only piece of furniture in the guest room is the bed that I was sleeping in, no nightstands or closets or anything. Then I heard another creak. I sat frozen, unable to do anything but listen. It seemed like whatever was making the sound was intentionally trying to be quiet, I could imagine a person taking long exaggerated steps to make less noise. I heard another creak, and another, ever closer they came. They seemed to be coming from the direction of the guest bedroom. But then they stopped. I must've sat there paralyzed for twenty minutes before I even had the courage to stand up off the toilet. I turned on the light in the bathroom, so I can see more than just what the night light illuminates. I stood in front of the door for what seemed like an eternity and thought about what might be on the other side, or what I'll do after opening the door. In a moment of either bravery or foolishness I threw open the door and stepped back. I saw nothing but the wall of the hallway. the light from the bathroom only lit up what was directly outside the bathroom. I now had about a foot of light worth of vision in the hallway, flanked by an inky abyss on either side going towards the living room and guest room.

The bathroom light flickered and went out and I was left with nothing but the nightlight, I could only see what was directly in front of me. Then I heard more creaking from the direction of the living room, and with very quick intervals this time.",1,1754858626.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Everyone around me thought I'd lost my mind.

Nathan Reed came from a good family, had money, and was devoted at home. As a stay-at-home wife, I supposedly had it all—so why throw it away?

They said I'd regret it.

And maybe I was crazy.

Because the moment I saw him carrying a bag for his ex, I snapped.

......

It was an orange Hermès Kelly bag, lychee grain leather.

I'd begged Nathan for that bag for ages, but he never bought it for me.

But this morning, I saw it dangling off the arm of his freshly divorced first love—Vanessa Blake.

There was no way she could afford it herself. It didn’t need spelling out.

That night, I asked him directly.

“Did you give Vanessa that bag?”

Nathan had just gotten home from the research institute, face drawn with fatigue. He didn't even look up.

“Yeah.”

One word. No explanation, no guilt—like buying gifts for another woman was just another Tuesday.

I pushed on. “Are you two seeing each other now?”

That finally got a reaction. He looked up, brows drawn tight.

“Emily Carter, is that all you think about? You see a bag and jump straight to cheating?”

That was Nathan. Always sharp. Never gentle. Always turning the spotlight back on me.

When I asked if he wanted breakfast, he'd snap, “What else?”

When I reached out, trying to be close, he’d brush me off. “Can't you see I'm tired?”

It was exhausting.

Around me, he never bothered to speak kindly.

But with others? He was different.

As a pharmaceutical company CEO and lead research engineer, Nathan knew how to turn on the charm.

With business partners, he was smooth-talking.

With family and kids, he was warm and attentive.

And with Vanessa? Even more so. When he spoke to her, even his eyes smiled.

Thinking about it all, I suddenly felt hollow.

I let out a breath.

“Let's get a divorce. I'm done.”

He glanced at me, said nothing, and walked straight into the bathroom.

......

Not long after, the family group chat on Facebook Messenger exploded. My mom fired off a string of voice messages, each nearly a minute long, every one brimming with outrage.

“Emily Carter, are you out of your damn mind? Walking away from a rich husband and a cushy life? If you dare go through with this divorce, I swear I’ll—”

I tapped on one, listened halfway through, then closed it. I'd heard it all before. I was tired.

I went straight to the county court's website and submitted an appointment request.

I should've done this a long time ago.

What was the point of a husband who always took someone else’s side?

I wiped my eyes and looked toward the bathroom. Water was still running steadily.

There was one more thing I needed to do. Something every person on the brink of divorce ends up doing.

I grabbed the car keys and headed to the underground garage.

After wiping away fresh tears, I yanked open the driver’s door.

Usually, I sat in the back with our daughter, Nova, while she rode in her car seat.

The front passenger seat was always empty.

The “Mrs. Reed Exclusive” sticker I'd once stuck on the center console was now faded and curling at the edges.

That sticker had moved with us—from the old Audi A8L to the Range Rover.

I'd been through the worst with Nathan.

A month after our wedding, his father had been kicked off the board for stock manipulation and banned from the securities market for life. The family teetered on bankruptcy. Their estate nearly got repossessed.

With my encouragement, Nathan broke away and started his own company—dodging the family disaster.

Later, we poured everything we had into helping the family stay afloat.

Honestly? Those broke years were the happiest.

But there was no going back.

I accidentally flipped open the sun visor.

The mirror behind it revealed a surprise that hit me like a slap.

Drawn in bright red lipstick were two hearts pierced by a single arrow.

Chapter 2
One look—and I knew exactly who had drawn it.

Lancôme #274. Vanessa Blake’s go-to shade.

The bright smear on the mirror burned my eyes. I reached for a tissue to wipe it away—

But Nathan Reed grabbed my wrist.

He’d just come out of the shower, damp bangs clinging to his forehead. Water droplets hit my hand—cold as ice.

His eyes were sharp, almost accusatory.

“What are you doing in my car?”

I pointed at the lipstick on the mirror. “Vanessa’s, right?”

“Yeah,” he replied, tone flat, like it meant nothing.

No explanation. No shame.

“Don’t touch anything in my car. Get out.”

I yanked my wrist free and stayed put, voice calm.

“Your car? Let me correct you—this was bought with our joint funds. I have every right to be here.”

I paused.

“Don’t worry. After the divorce, I wouldn’t touch this car with a ten-foot pole.”

It was tainted.

Nathan let out a cold laugh. “Fine. Divorce it is.”

He opened the back door and pulled out a red velvet box.

I froze. It looked vaguely familiar, but before I could place it, he circled back, standing beside the car, face shadowed, unreadable.

“What, you want a divorce? Let’s go, then. We’ll talk terms inside.”

He tossed the words out lightly and walked off, his back cold and distant.

Watching him leave, my heart felt like it was being crushed under a boulder.

Seven years of marriage, nights spent side by side—and he couldn’t even fake a shred of hesitation.

My patience, my self-restraint—all of it felt like a cruel joke.

I checked the time. Still early. I could handle the other thing later.

I followed him upstairs, trailing a few steps behind.

When we reached the apartment door, someone was already waiting.

And she was holding Nova’s hand.

Vanessa Blake stood there, long black curls cascading over her shoulders, effortlessly elegant.

You’d never guess she’d just walked out of a messy, bloody divorce.

When she saw Nathan, her lips curled into a soft, glowing smile.

“Nova called and said she wasn’t feeling well, so I picked her up from her after-school class. Forgot to let you know,” she said, voice light and sweet.

“Thanks for the trouble,” Nathan replied. Then he looked down at Nova, frowning slightly.

“Next time, don’t bother Aunt Vanessa. If something’s wrong, call your mom.”

Nova pouted, casting me a sideways glance before ducking behind Vanessa.

“I don’t wanna call Mom! She always makes me do stuff I hate. She won’t let me eat sweets, won’t let me have strawberries…”

Her voice was full of childish indignation.

When had she turned into this?

I used to spend nights trying to figure it out, chalking it up to rebellion or defiance.

But now? I didn’t care to analyze it anymore. It just didn’t matter.

I didn’t bother explaining, like I used to—softly, patiently.

“It’s because you had cavities, sweetheart. That’s why no sweets. And you’re allergic to strawberries, remenber?”

I stepped forward to unlock the door.

But Nova suddenly darted out from behind Vanessa, fists raised, and pounded them against my leg.

“Bad Mommy!”

I stood there, frozen, staring down at her tear-streaked face, silently absorbing her anger and her tiny fists.

Until Nathan picked her up and soothed her.

“Don’t be mad, Nova. Daddy will take you to get some candy.”

Once she calmed down, he looked over at me.

He didn’t say a word. He didn’t have to.

Nova wrapped one arm around his neck and grabbed Vanessa’s hand with the other.

“Aunt Vanessa, can you and Daddy take me to the candy store near school? Please?”

My brows twitched slightly.

An invisible hand seemed to clutch my chest—then let go, leaving only empty air.

Before Nathan could meet my eyes, I unlocked the door.

“I’ll draft the agreement,” I said flatly. “You can look it over when you get back.”

I stepped inside. Alone.

I’d planned to ask Nova if she wanted to stay with Daddy or Mommy.

Now I didn’t need to ask.

I already had my answer.

And her?

I didn’t want her either.

Chapter 3
It was eight o’clock at night when Nathan Reed came home with our daughter, Nova.

Minutes later, I heard the familiar sounds of her flipping through the fridge and turning on the TV. Those bad habits—snacking mindlessly, staring at screens for hours—used to worry me.

I wanted her to grow up healthy and beautiful, so I’d tried to be firm. But all it earned me was a cold “bad mom,” thrown in my face like a dart. These days, I just let it go.

Before long, my bedroom door burst open. Nova marched in, parked herself beside my bed, and started yanking at the blanket.

“Why didn’t you run my bath? I want a milk bubble bath tonight!”

I pressed the blanket down and said flatly, “I’m tired. Go ask your dad.”

She didn’t move. Instead, she grabbed my arm, trying to drag me out of bed. “Dad worked all day! He’s exhausted! You don’t do anything at home. I want you to give me a bath!”

Her words landed like a slap. I almost blurted out, Who taught you to talk like that? But I swallowed it back.

I sat up—and that’s when I saw the divorce papers crumpled in her hand. She’d doodled a cartoon family of three across the page. On one side was Nathan, holding her hand. On the other, a woman with long, dark curls. I didn’t need to ask. It was clearly Vanessa Blake.

Nova tilted her head, giving me a look full of smug defiance, like I was some stray dog soaked in rain. “Dad told me to draw it. He said if you don’t behave, he’ll punish you and make sure you’re not my mom anymore!”

I let out a cold laugh. “Is that so?”

A chill spread through my chest.

Just then, Nathan walked in, toweling off his hair. He completely ignored Nova’s outburst and addressed me in that commanding tone he always used.

“I’m heading out on a business trip in a few days. Pack my suitcase.”

I didn’t move. “I’m serious about the divorce,” I said, steady and calm.

He paused—just for a beat—before narrowing his eyes. The flicker of surprise gave way to annoyance.

“This is about a purse? I’ll send you money. Buy it yourself.”

My phone buzzed. A Venmo notification appeared: $200 from Nathan.

The sting behind my eyes surprised me. I let out a soft, bitter laugh.

Nathan was wealthy—spending tens of thousands without blinking. But now, he tossed me two hundred bucks like I was a panhandler.

I accepted the transfer, my face going cold. “That should cover the divorce filing fee. We’ll divide everything else later.”

He scoffed like I’d just told a joke. “Divorce? You sure about that?”

We locked eyes. The silence between us thickened like fog.

“Mom’s not listening, Dad! Punish her!” Nova cried, clinging to his arm.

Nathan didn’t even flinch. Without a word, he picked her up and walked out.

Moments later, my phone pinged again. A message popped up on FB Messenger. It was a lawyer’s contact card from Nathan, followed by a single line: Talk to my lawyer.

My chest tightened. I stared at the blank message box, fingers frozen above the keyboard. Was there a reset button for life?

After a long pause, I typed: Okay.

I added his lawyer and sent a message stating my intent. By the next morning, the friend request still hadn’t been accepted. Nathan had spent the night in the study.

When I came downstairs, he was shaving in front of the mirror. He was using the imported sensitive-skin shaving cream I’d ordered for him, the one that didn’t trigger his allergies. The bottle was almost empty now.

He saw me in the doorway. His hand stilled for a moment, then he quietly switched his phone to speaker and placed it on the counter.

“Mr. Reed,” the lawyer’s voice came through, “your wife contacted me on Messenger yesterday about a divorce. How would you like to proceed?”

Nathan didn’t look at me. He focused on a patch of missed stubble and replied with careless disdain, “How should you proceed? I hired you to protect my interests. You tell me.”

I said nothing, just watched him.

Back when we were dating, I’d been obsessed with Marriage Story. Scarlett Johansson’s character wrestled with the wreckage of a broken marriage. I remember asking Nathan, “If—and I mean if—we ever got divorced, would we end up fighting over money and assets like that?”

He kissed my hair and said with certainty, “There’s no ‘if.’ I’m growing old with you.”

I could still see the light in his eyes when he said it.

My phone buzzed again. His lawyer had accepted the request.

Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed has authorized me to represent him in your divorce. What are your terms?

At that moment, Nathan brushed past me with a cold, impassive face.

Nova’s voice floated down the hall. “Dad, I want to stay at Aunt Vanessa’s for a really long time! Don’t pick me up too soon, okay?”

“Okay,” he said.

I didn’t turn around. I waited until the front door closed before replying to the lawyer:

Equal division of marital assets. I don’t want custody of our daughter.

Chapter 4
The moment I sent the message, a screenshot came back instantly.

It was a chat log between Nathan and his lawyer.

Nathan Reed: Send her this: If she wants a divorce, she leaves with nothing.

I felt the heat rise behind my eyes.

Seven years of marriage, and this was how it would end? I’d thought we could separate with at least a shred of dignity. Clearly, I’d been naive.

I shut off my phone and took a breath. Once the fury had cooled, I turned it back on and started looking for a divorce attorney. After some initial consultations, one of them offered a suggestion.

“Your husband’s a public figure. If you want leverage, gather proof of his affair. That kind of evidence can shift the power dynamic.”

Proof?

I had none. Outwardly, Nathan had never crossed a line.

The silence in the house was suffocating. Nova was at Vanessa’s, and Nathan hadn’t come home. I sat at my computer, blankly refreshing the county court’s appointment page. My heart felt like a stagnant pond.

Leave with nothing? No. I wasn’t going down without a fight.

Just then, a video call from Ashley popped up on Messenger. Her camera was shaking wildly.

“Emily, you need to see what your husband’s doing right now!”

The video stabilized. Nathan and Vanessa were at a dinner table, arm in arm, clinking glasses and laughing, egged on by clients.

Nathan never drank. His stomach couldn’t handle it—he’d ended up in the ER years ago with a bleeding ulcer. After that, he swore off alcohol completely.

He’d told me once, “My health is everything. If I’m gone, how are you supposed to go on?”

But here he was, drinking with Vanessa like nothing mattered.

After the first toast, the clients weren’t done.

“Mr. Reed, there’s still half a bottle left. Don’t let it go to waste!”

Nathan’s expression faltered slightly, but before he could respond, Vanessa grabbed the bottle. “His stomach’s weak. I’ll drink for him!”

She threw her head back and downed the entire half bottle. Coughing, she smiled playfully. “That enough?”

For a moment, the room went quiet. Then came the laughter.

“Mr. Reed, you’re one lucky man! A woman like this—priceless!”

Vanessa’s eyes shimmered as she played humble. “Oh, it’s nothing. Compared to Mrs. Reed, I’m barely doing anything.”

A client perked up. “Oh? Is Mrs. Reed an even heavier drinker?”

Another joined in, “How about this, Mr. Reed—call your wife. If she finishes a glass, I’ll sign that billion-dollar contract tonight!”

Nathan hesitated, then pulled out his phone.

Ashley’s video cut off as my phone rang.

It was Nathan. His voice was low, cold. “I’m giving you an out, Emily. Come to The Ember Room now, and I’ll pretend none of this happened.”

I looked at our wedding photo, crumpled at the bottom of the trash can.

My voice was just as cold. “No.”

He went silent, then snapped, “Fine. Don’t regret this.”

I wouldn’t.

Ashley called again. The video resumed. Nathan slammed his glass on the table. Vanessa grabbed his arm, murmuring sweetly, “Don’t be mad. If she won’t come, I’ll drink for you—”

Ashley muttered under her breath, “Fucking snakes.”

Nathan heard something by the door and looked sharply toward it.

He’d noticed the camera.

His eyes locked onto the lens. Then, he grabbed Vanessa’s wrist as she held her drink.

“You want a show? Record this. Make sure she sees it.”

He downed a shot and kissed Vanessa full on the lips, liquor dripping from their mouths.

A sharp pain stabbed my chest. Then it receded, leaving nothing but numbness.

I stopped the recording and sent the video to Nathan’s lawyer.

“Is this worth half his assets?”

Nathan’s company had just gone public. A scandal like this could destroy it.

A long silence followed.

Then came the reply: Mr. Reed agrees.

A divorce agreement arrived seconds later.

I'd won. I should’ve felt triumphant.

But all I saw in the black phone screen was a pale, exhausted reflection of myself.

On TV, a travel ad flickered on: “Feeling lost? Burnt out? At the edge of the world lies an island that can cleanse your soul.”

Iceland.

My heart stirred.

Since getting married, I’d barely had a moment to myself. Maybe it was time.

I booked a flight and started packing.

Halfway through, I stopped.

There, buried beneath a sweater, was the red velvet box Nathan had pulled from his car the day I first mentioned divorce.

Inside was a man’s wedding band.

Chapter 5
Nathan Reed never liked wearing jewelry.

When I once begged him to get matching couple’s rings, he turned me down flat.

“I don’t like feeling tied down,” he said, final and firm.

But when he proposed, he chose a wedding band.

Under the golden glow of a Rocky Mountain sunset, we exchanged rings and kissed—like we’d just claimed the whole damn world.

Later, I teased him, “Didn’t you say you hated rings?”

He kissed the one on my finger, his gaze full of love—and something close to reverence.

“The mark proves our love. I’ll never take it off, not in this lifetime.”

Back then, I was the center of his world.

Somewhere along the way, though, Nathan stopped wearing his ring.

Not that it mattered anymore.

Mine had been gone for ages—lost somewhere in the wreckage of us.

......

He didn’t come home that night. Neither did Nova.

The day I booked my flight to Iceland, a package arrived. The sender’s name? Nova.

I hesitated. Then tore it open.

Inside was a Hermès Kelly—vibrant orange, lychee leather. The one I’d always wanted.

Tucked next to it was a note, scrawled in Vanessa Blake’s unmistakable handwriting:

“Heard you were ready to divorce Nathan over this bag. Here it is—so quit throwing tantrums.”

“Oh, and Nathan’s just been with me these past few days, looking after Nova. Maybe try coaxing him a little?”

I tossed the card without blinking.

When you’re truly done, even betrayal loses its sting.

I got rid of everything.

The wedding photos.

The matching down jackets.

The his-and-hers coffee mugs.

Gone. Every last piece.

Right after the cleaning crew hauled off the boxes, the front door creaked open.

Nathan and Vanessa walked in, each holding one of Nova’s hands.

The second she saw me, Nova yanked free, climbed onto the couch, and started barking orders like a little queen.

“Get me ice cream! And Chips Ahoy!”

I ignored her.

I grabbed my suitcase and made for the door—but Nathan stepped in my way, his hand locking down on the handle.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

“On a trip,” I said, cool and flat.

He opened his mouth, but Vanessa jumped in, her voice syrupy-sweet.

“Emily’s probably just tired. A little getaway might clear her head. You two can talk when she gets back.”

She turned to me with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

“Go enjoy yourself. Don’t worry about Nova—I’ve got her.”

I was about to reply when Nathan’s voice cut through—sharp, demanding.

“Where’s your ring?”

I followed his gaze to my bare finger.

“Lost it,” I said.

His eyes flickered—doubt, maybe—but he masked it quickly.

“Come home soon,” he said.

I gave him a faint smile and didn’t answer.

This wasn’t my home anymore. And I wasn’t coming back.

I closed the door behind me, shutting them all out, then hailed a cab to the airport.

Seven hours later, I landed in Iceland

Quiet. Distant. A beautiful escape from the life I’d known.

The noise, the pain, the wreckage of my marriage—fading with every mile.

One night, I stood with a group of travelers, waiting for the aurora. My phone buzzed. Unknown number.

Nathan.

I thought it might be about the divorce papers, so I stepped away to answer.

Instead, I got this:

“Why aren’t you back yet? When are you going to take me off your block list?”

I frowned, pulling up my calendar.

“Ten days.”

Ten days until the divorce decree was finalized.

As for the block list? He wasn’t getting off it.

“Ten days?” His voice tightened. “Don’t forget who you are. You’re Nova’s mother. You’re my—”

“Emily! The aurora’s out—make a wish!”

A fellow traveler’s shout drowned him out.

I set the phone down, closed my eyes, and made my wish:

May the rest of my days—alone—shine bright and bold.

Ten days later, I was back in the States.

After landing, I hit the salon. When I looked in the mirror, I saw crisp white blouse, glowing skin, and the version of me I hadn’t seen in years—vibrant, fearless, unapologetically alive.

I texted Nathan to meet at a coffee shop near the county courthouse.

He was already there when I arrived.

His eyes lit up when he saw me, but the awe faded fast, replaced by that same smug, controlling tone I’d grown to loathe.

“You can’t keep doing this, Emily—running off like that. The house has been a mess without you.”

As if I was supposed to slink back and play the dutiful wife. As if the screaming matches and shattered trust had all been some temporary drama.

I cut him off. “Let’s go.”

“Go where?” he blinked.

I showed him my Messenger chat with the lawyer, then locked my screen and stood up.

“To the Clerk’s Office. To pick up the divorce decree.”

I took it to mean it was more like my expectations are not in line.

Is this common? There are definitely vulnerable moments at work, not going psychotic but stuff like blanking or stammering that might give people pause.

I think I've reached the end of that discussion with my psychiatrist unless something changes in my condition. Is there anything else that can be done? I don't want to switch meds or add stimulants (though the option is open). I drink coffee.",1,1754858437.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

It was a large softcover, about 8x10 or a bit bigger, and although it was thin it had big full-page photos and stats for each ride. The book had real photos of coasters like The Beast, Son of Beast, Kingda Ka, and X/X2. The cover was lime green, blue, and red, with the title in white text. It was aimed at kids or teens, not a dense coffee-table book, and I’m pretty sure the title had the word “rides” or “roller coasters” in it.

These seem to be my thing at times, with last night being a night where I clearly really wanted to do 'my thing'! Naturally, my MyAir App gave me a pat on the back and a 100% vitality score because my AHI was 5.7 and I slept for 7 hours (then woke up like I was late for something really important, made it downstairs, had a coffee and then fell asleep for another 4 hours 😁). Pulse ox had me averaging at 87% , low as 81% -has been worse- but I don't take that as particularly accurate.

I sometimes just have random ones scattered through the night, or the same patterns but under the 10 seconds to count as an apnea,  but seem to get more in clusters at certain times (like when everything else in me is as half assed as my breathing!) with some either lame breathing patterns in between or some slightly more normal looking ones, and the clusters definitely have a greater effect on me than random ones throughout the night.

Have respiratory appointment on Tuesday so any thoughts would be welcome. I'm still on fixed pressure of 8, also sleep on a wedge, I've also now taken to filming myself while asleep to see if I'm slipping into a stupid position (both for this and other reasons) which I do seem to do head and neck wise, but have largely so far just got footage of me soundo and still or my dog getting up, stretching, looking at me as if to say 'doh, she's still asleep' and then settling back down infront of the camera 🤦‍♀️😂

Open to ideas as well.","I am a Dairy Queen (not the ice cream place, just a lover of lactose) and refuse to give up whole milk. I tried, I really did, but have yet to find a plant milk or “skinny” cow milk that doesn’t taste like bitter disappointment in coffee. 

Solution? I take my first love (aka A2 whole milk from Costco) and mix it with water, using either half or 2/3 cup milk per cup of liquid. For example, for my chia pudding with homemade vanilla (which slaps, lmk if you want the recipe) I use 2/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup water. Half whole milk, half water has less calories than skim, and a 1/3-2/3 mix has less calories than 1%. In my opinion, it tastes far better than either. That said, I’m still looking for substitutions when it comes to half and half or heavy cream in sauces and the like - if you’ve found a sub that doesn’t taste like disappointment, share it, eh?

Also, I still haven’t tried fairlife. That might be my next go to, but again, I’m pretty sensitive to flavors and I like what I like, ie full fat dairy, or at least the taste of it even if diluted. If fairlife tastes the same as regular whole milk, I’d like to hear it. If anyone out there has found ways to work full fat dairy into their diet in ways like this, I am all ears as well.",0,1754858020.0,Volumeeating,7,0.33,False

My Dad is 95yo living alone in N.Y. He’s basically fine for his age. He has a caregiver twice a week for about 6 hours to help with appointments and food shopping. My Mom passed away at the age of 93 almost two years ago. My parents, in many recent years, really didn’t have a circle of friends. My Mom would go to some neighbors and they’d have coffee and chat and she enjoyed talking to the neighbors but ultimately they liked (so they said) their alone life. So now it’s only my Dad. No friend and no family members. He values his independence and privacy. Still having work done around the house. I’m in constant communication with him and have been doing Sunday Video/FaceTimes with my parents since I moved to LA almost 20 years ago. I also worked with my Dad for 19 years before he retired in 2000. I spent a ton of time with my parents in the 80’s and 90’s because that’s what I did. I myself didn’t have a lot of friends because I was and even a bit now, painfully shy. I had the opportunity to work in LA for a few months which turned into meeting my husband, the man I’ve been with for almost 20 years. I know my parents were happy about that…that I’m being “taking” care of. I had a great career out here, retired now. I also know they had worries about me, that I’d never “get a life” so to speak. So I know they are/were thrilled for me. My husband now needs major surgery scheduled the beginning of September. I am torn…who do I care for? I know…my husband. I know without a doubt I’m not the person to actually caregive to my Dad. My wheelhouse are other things. I can communicate correctly without stressing him out. He has his moments when he gets short with me, so I know me being there in the house with him for hours and hours won’t be good for either one of us. Am I wrong? We do our word puzzles everyday and share our results. He is obviously better than I am, but I try! It’s just hard to see my loved ones age. These last few years are almost bonus years. But sometimes my Dad seems sad. But he doesn’t want to discuss as usual. So…we just keep doing what we do. As best as we can. As best as I can. Of course without a doubt I will visit him when I can. I also know if I said this he would almost forbid it because “you need to care for your husband..your life is with him.”  I guess I’m looking for emotional support from this sub.

I say officially because I had met him once before, he came to pick her up and the two of them stayed for coffee. That was not the best first impression, my parents were there and we all thought he was a bit of a show off, since he unprompted kept mentioning his work and his trips. That’s why my friend decided to redo the introduction by formally inviting my younger sibling and I  over for lunch. The lunch itself was very nice, they both prepared the food and they got several wines for us to try but I didn’t really like it.

For some context, my friend has known both my younger sibling and I since we were little children. We all consider each other family and she’s very close with my sibling as well. She’s recently ended a long term relationship and entered a new one. She met this guy about a month after her breakup and officially started dating him less than a month ago, although they regularly hung out multiple times a week since they met.

In summary, I didn’t really like him and neither did my brother. He kept interrupting me whenever I tried to talk during the conversation, he mansplained several things regarding my job to me, tried to debate my brother and I on some political things (he made comments that implied that it’s not important to know history and that all humanities professors are left wing brainwashers) and didn’t really try to engage in a conversation. When asked about his interests, he implied that I wouldn’t know about it since he is not into “mainstream things”. He was kinda condescending thought the meal, and his whole demeanor changed when my brother got up to smoke some 🍃 outside (we were at my friends house and she had no issue with it). While we were still eating dessert, he got up from the table and sat on the couch and started loudly playing TikTok videos without excusing himself. A few minutes later, he went to take a nap without saying goodbye. We didn’t say bye to him by the time we left because he didn’t come out afterwards. He did more things during lunch as well but I don’t want to give too many details or make the post too long, but I’ll answer questions if more context is needed. 

My friend is going to want to know if I’ve liked him. She seems very happy in this relationship and she sounds enthusiastic whenever she talks about him. I don’t want to burst her bubble but I also don’t want to lie to her, although I don’t think I have any concrete red flags to share with her, so I don’t know what to do. Should I tell her the truth, soften it a little or just keep it vague?

I told my partner around bedtime: *""something feels a bit off""*, and it felt uncomfortable if they draped their arm over my chest. I had checked my blood pressure after my daily exercise (light cardio, biking 1 hour). 120/83. My heart rate hit 130 during the exercise, and measured 72 afterwards.

💓❓**Thursday**   
Sudden odd sensations in my chest! Like a sudden squeeze — not being quite able to draw a breath in for a second or two; an uncomfortable swell of light pain in my chest, almost as though I were pushing a strained or pulled muscle. I decided to measure my blood pressure at 1PM. It was unexpectedly high: 129/99, with a heart rate of 91 in rest! (Perhaps important to note: I'd eaten 1 hour before. 3 spoonfuls of soy yoghurt with a handful of mixed nuts. Drink: squeezed lemon+1.2L water. I've sworn off coffee months ago).   
To rule out blood sugar, I took some gummy bears — didn't fix the problem. I ate dinner while standing, because the moment I'd sit down the feeling came.   
It wasn't until 10pm that it began to subside.

🩺😇**Friday**   
I hoped all would be back to normal! My heart rate was at a stable 54 before getting up. Yet it returned at 09:30, a minute after I sat down. Blood pressure was high again. And I've continuously felt as though I can't breathe in 100%. The chest pain also radiated, oddly enough towards my shoulder and jaw area. So, I called my GP.   
As I briskly went to his office, the feeling subsided. He took my blood pressure. *""Bit high, but nothing unusual in this office""*; he asked me if I had some stress, which I don't; and listened to my heartbeat. It felt fine, and he couldn't hear anything odd. So, he said that I was fine; maybe a bit stressed. (Yet I'm pretty sure that I've achieved full relaxation and still gotten it).   
That evening my partner realized they've got a smart watch device that, even if unprofessional, might give a rough clue.

As soon as Nathan sees this he gets upset and refuses to help. Eventually mom gets him to take a bag of coffee cans into the house. But as soon as he lets go of that damn bag, and I mean as. soon. as he. drops. The damn. bag. He sits down on the couch to watch tv. And something in me just snapped? I asked him if he could help unpack the bags because he barely helped getting the bags out the car, and didn't help pack them at grandpa's house either. When dad came back and asked me to help unpack the bags, nathen was still on the couch. I could go rambling on and on with examples, but it gets boring after hearing the almost same story over and over again bi-daily  ",1,1754857409.0,u_DrawerRough773,0,1.0,False

I’m James Clayton, lifelong sci-fi nut, coffee devotee, and unapologetic action-adventure junkie. I spent years teaching 3D animation before deciding to leap into a whole new dimension: storytelling.

My debut novel, ***Vanguardian Saga: The Road to Molz Dorn***, follows an elite black-ops team of anthropomorphic heroes sent on an impossible mission to a hostile planet. Picture G.I. Joe meets Zootopia meets Gears of War — with claws, plasma rifles, and a whole lot of trouble. It's available on Amazon. A link is in my profile if you're interested.

At the heart of it all is Kahl Striver, a black-ops tiger soldier who has a talent for surviving suicide missions alongside his crew of space marines… and making his enemies wish they’d never been born.

The book’s a fast-paced space opera for ages 12 and up, inspired by the pulse-pounding 90s anime I grew up with — *Ghost in the Shell*, *Ninja Scroll*, *Outlaw Star* — packed with grit, spectacle, heart, and yes… just a dash of gore.

If that’s your thing, give it a look! And if you’ve got questions about the book or the universe, I’m happy to answer them. Thanks for reading, and see you on Molz Dorn!",1,1754857402.0,BookPromotion,0,1.0,False

He finally moves, and I don't know why, but I expect him to finally push her off. Instead, he lifts his hands to her arms, resting them on top of hers, almost like he's holding her there.



My stomach revolts violently, and I'm sure I'm about to be sick all over the club floor.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Jesse

The decor of this clubhouse is familiar, even if the rest of it isn’t. My eyes land on the license plates lining the wall behind the bar, the chrome engine mounted high, and the scarred table, chairs and stools littering the room–most of them mismatched, but still somehow looking like they belonged. The bar, the central hub of the Dark Shadows, is bigger here than what they had in Willowbank, but it’s crowded tonight, full of brothers, girls and faces I don’t recognize. Hangarounds–friends of the brothers or people not part of the club, but wish they were.

I shoot a questioning look over my shoulder at Ash and he leans in close to murmur, “Patch party for Logan.”

An image of a young baby-faced prospect comes to mind, and I nod. “His road name?”

There’s a slight pause before he admits, “Skids.”

I pause misstep, my mouth forming an o. “That’s unfortunate.” Any other time, and the name would have me laughing, but humor feels like a distant thing.

Ash makes a small noise of agreement, his hand landing on the small of my back, urging me forward. A childish impulse rears its head, demanding I dig my heels in. It screams that I need to turn and run back the way I came, to escape. It orders me to shut my eyes, cover my ears and just scream, so none of this can actually touch me.

It already has, though, and that’s not how life works. Especially mine.

As we walk, more heads turn in our direction, but I don’t look at them. I don’t acknowledge them at all, because I don’t want to see their expressions. My stomach churns, nausea crawling into the back of my throat. Even if my mother hadn’t–… even if she was still here, this wouldn’t be a happy reunion. You can’t just suddenly pretend you’re not married, especially after everything we’ve been through.

Andrew Chattens made me promises over a decade ago, and in the space of a single year, he’d srewed up every single one.

I clutch the bundle of material closer to my chest, trying to staunch the pain that feels like it’s seeping through my pores. I wonder if they can sense it as I walk by. The absolute devastation that weighs my every step down until I’m surprised I don’t just sink through the floor.

My head throbs, a vicious reminder I’ve had nothing to drink since my coffee before I’d left for my shift this morning, and I couldn’t even remember the last time I’d eaten. The pounding bass of the rock music only fuels the pain until every blink feels like a stabbing needle, jabbing into my eye.

It seems like Ash is leading me towards a corner of the bar, shoving anyone who doesn’t immediately get out of his way. I can’t help searching through the mass of bodies, looking for a familiar head of tousled blond hair, and then someone moves and I see him. My heart skips a beat, my reaction trained into me after years of being us.

It takes only a second to assess the situation, my steps slowing to a stop. He’s slouched back against a corner of the couch, sitting on his own. His head is down, a beer bottle clutched in his hands, but I can see the dull flush covering his cheekbones and the way his lids droop like they’ve got weights attached to them. There are three other empties littering the small table in front of him, and I exhale heavily. He was here, getting trashed, while my mother took her last breath.

I swallow thickly, my eyes stinging as I stubbornly blink the stars away. Rage and grief battle for dominance in me, because I already know I haven’t just lost my only parent today.

There’s movement behind him, a flash of shiny blond hair, and then a body leans over the back of the couch, wrapping arms around his shoulders.

“Jesse–” Ash starts, but I whirl on him.

“Don’t.” His face falls at my tone, but he still tries to put a hand on my shoulder. I ruthlessly shake him off. “You knew,” I breathe out, my stare accusing. “You knew what I was walking into and you didn’t even have the decency to–” my voice cracks and I sink my teeth into my bottom lip, desperately trying to stop it from wobbling. When I feel like I’ve regained control, I say dully, “He hasn’t picked up my calls in a month and if you try to tell me you didn’t know something was going on, I won’t believe you. You’ve known him longer than I have, and I know where your priorities lie.” I try to stifle it, but a bitter noise still leaks out, making Ash wince. “I just thought I knew what his priorities were, but I guess I was wrong.”

“It’s not like that, Jesse,” he tries to argue, but I glare at him, pointing a shaking finger at the couple on the couch, seemingly still unaware we’re standing there.

“My mother is dead,” I hiss out, hearing someone gasp from nearby but not taking my stare off the president. “And your VP is drunk off his hip while some hooker is groping him. So, go on. Tell me exactly what it’s like?”

His eyes pinch at the corners, but he wisely holds his tongue. But to me, that says far more than anything else ever could. I give him one last scathing glare before turning back to my husband, watching as the girl, one I’d once considered a friend, leans further down, whispering something into his ear. She presses a peck to his cheek and I vaguely observe he needs to shave, his jaw covered in several days worth of light-covered stubble. It doesn’t hide the red lipstick smear she leaves on him, and even though he doesn’t acknowledge her at all, it feels like a punch to the solar plexus; my breath wheezing out sharply.

I don’t have a problem with any of the other club girls, but Brittany is different. She’s a two-faced hooker, one who once swore she wasn’t interested in my boyfriend. I’d learned differently when I’d begged off a party, insisting Drew go without me, and she’d followed him into a bathroom, propositioning him by shutting the door and stripping her top off. Drew had been honest with me, giving me every gory detail, but even if he hadn’t, rumors had blasted through school after he’d stormed out, leaving her standing there half-undressed in front of a queue of people waiting for their turn.

Monday, she’d completely ignored me, pretending I didn’t even exist. In fact, she didn’t speak to me again until the day she’d turned up as a club girl for the MC, and then, she’d never had a nice thing to say. When the Dark Shadows had moved to Oakfield, I’d been relieved I wouldn’t have to deal with run-ins with her anymore, even if I’d hated the distance between me and Drew.

Guess she’s the one laughing now.

Brittany’s hands slide under the sides of Drew’s cut, her fingers trailing suggestively over the cotton shirt covering his chest. He finally moves, and I don’t know why, but I expect him to finally push her off. Instead, he lifts his hands to her arm, resting them on top of hers, almost like he’s holding her there. My stomach revolts violently, and I’m sure I’m about to be sick all over the club floor.

“Dodger!” Ash shouts, his jaw clenched so tight, I’m surprised he’s not chipping his molars. Someone cuts the music off, a dense hush falling over the place. I can feel eyes burning into my back, but my focus is on Drew as he slowly looks up, eyes glazed and uncomprehending. He looks at his president before sliding his stare lazily over me, and then back to Ash. Then, he freezes, his mouth falling open. Almost in slow-motion, his wide eyes land back on, panic flaring. I can practically see his hope that he might be imagining me standing there, but several blinks later, and his panic escalates. Still, he doesn’t move and neither does she–except the smirk curling up her red lips as she watches me with hard eyes.

The silence around us is suffocating, my skin itching with the need to get out. Not yet, I remind myself, stepping forward, still clutching the bundle in my arms.

“Jesse,” Ash murmurs, but I don’t take my stare off my husband.

“I tried to call,” I say loud enough that my voice carries, the slightest tremble to it. “But I suppose this way is better. This way leaves no doubt about what comes next.”

“Doll,” he croaks, and it’s quickly followed by his face paling as he finally seems to realize another woman is wrapped around him. He throws her arms off, leaning forward like he might get to his feet. “Doll–” he says again, but I cut him off.

“No need to move. I’ll be finished in a minute.”

“Jesse,” Ash whispers. “Don’t do this.”

I flick him a dirty stare. “He made his choice,” I tell him frostily, “and so did you. Now, we all get to deal with the consequences of it.” I pause, whispering quietly, “Me, most of all.”

“No, doll, you don’t understand.” Dodge clambers to his feet unsteadily, taking a step towards me. “I wasn’t–” he licks his lips, shaking his head as if that’ll clear away the alcoholic fog enough to gather his words. “I just needed some time.” He frowns. “Wait, why’re you here?” He looks around as if the people standing around us might have an answer for him.

I suck in a breath, digging deep for the last dregs of my courage, announcing coldly, “Lorraine is dead.” His mouth opens and shuts like a fish on a hook, his head shaking in denial, but there’s no give in my expression. He squeezes his eyes shut, dropping his chin to his chest.

Knowing I can’t let his emotions get to me, I continue, “I tried to call before she went.” A bark of laughter that cracks through the room. “A lot.” An arm suddenly wraps around my waist, offering me strength, and I look to my side, finding Lacey, grim-faced and furious as she stares at Drew. I let her hold me up with one glance of appreciation, exhaustion beating heavily at me. I look back at Drew, his head still down and cheeks wet, but I’m numb.

“I didn’t want to be alone when she finally let go,” I finally utter. “I’m lucky Lacey was there/” she tightens her arm around me, a silent acknowledgement. “Especially when my husband,” I sneer, “couldn’t be bothered to take a single one of my phone calls.”

He immediately goes digging for his phone, but I scoff. “Don’t act like you would’ve, Dodger. You haven’t taken a single call in a month, and I know it was just me you were sending to voicemail.”

“What?” He looks as pitiful as a kicked puppy, and I roll my eyes.

“I called you from a colleague’s phone, just to see what would happen. Imagine my shock when you answered, after not having taken one of my calls since you were last in Willowbank.” There’s a low rumble behind me, like someone actually growled, but I don’t look away from his crestfallen expression. My voice is almost wistful as I say, “I thought we were forever. Not the first time I’ve been wrong, huh? Should’ve stuck with the one thing I knew for sure.” I slide my eyes over Brittany, who takes a quick step back at whatever she sees in my stare. Looking back at Drew, I give him a sad smile. “Everyone leaves.”

He stumbles forward a step, hands reaching out like he’d try to grab me, but then Cannon’s there, taking hold of his arms and holding him in place. Drew turns with a snarl, “Get off me!”

Brittany recovers, strutting around the couch and stepping into his side. “Baby,” she starts, and he rounds on her, eyes glittering with malice.

“Screw off!”

He’s still struggling against Cannon when he looks back at me, just as I unravel the bundle in my arms, revealing the cut hiding under the jacket. I drop the jacket to the side as Ash hisses out a breath. “Jesse,” he says warningly, like I’m the one in the wrong. “Think about this. Don’t decide when you’re emotional.”

“Emotional?” I ask quietly. “I’m not emotional, Ash.” I keep my eyes locked with my husband’s, letting him see the truth. “I’m broken.” I suck in a breath. “And I’m done.”

“No!” Dodger yells out, his face flushing red. “You are not done!”

Like he hasn’t even spoken, I look down at the cut, tracing my fingers over the words sewed into the back. Property Of Dodger. What a joke. “I’ve been thinking about this for a while,” I murmur, and then look back at him, my mouth twisted and teeth clenched. “You aren’t the only one who can leave.”

I throw the cut down on the floor in front of him, turning on my heel and walking back the way I came. Every single person hastens to get out of my way, most of them not making eye contact. There’s a loud roar behind me, the sound of a scuffle and several thuds, but I don’t look back.

I step outside and bend at the waist, a long mournful howl escaping. My chest feels so tight, like it’s stretched out so much that it’s impossible to even draw in a breath, my eyes stinging with tears that refuse to fall. I’d been holding onto it all for so long, working myself to the bone, living with this dreadful hope over my head that maybe this wouldn’t be the thing that took Mom from me, and then knowing that Dodger was deliberately putting distance between us, even when he knew I needed him more than I ever had.

My legs collapse under me, my knees crashing hard to the gravel. Distantly, I feel the stinging pain of the rocks though my pants, but I’m so caught up in the maelstrom of emotion. It all feels like it’s pulverizing me into a shell and leaving absolutely nothing left. The idea of standing back up and facing this new world, when I’ve shattered into pieces, is inconceivable. There’s no recovering from this; no fixing it. What happened today can never be taken back, no matter how much I would wish it otherwise.

“Jesse,” a soft voice calls faintly behind me, but another choked sob escapes me, my body trembling as I curl into a ball. “Pick her up.”

Two large arms surround me, lifting me with ease, but even when they tuck me against a chest, smelling of leather and motor-oil, it’s not enough to pull me out. Each breath is a shuddery whine, reminding my foggy brain of a wounded animal.

“Come on, Jesse.” Hawk. It’s Hawk. “We’re taking you home.” He starts walking, his heavy boots crunching noisily against the gravel. “Spitfire, get the door.”

“She’s gone,” I whisper brokenly. “She’s gone and I’m alone.”

“You’re not alone,” a feminine voice whispers somewhere close to my head. Chloe. I hear a car door and then Hawk’s carefully placing me on the backseat of a truck. He steps back and Chloe’s there, wrapping a blanket tightly around me, her blue eyes sad and wet. “We have you, Jesse.”

She’s trying to convince me, but I barely hear it, too lost in my own misery. “She’s gone,” I repeat, staring into the distance. “And I wish I’d gone with her.”

As for that Wagner family's monster... well, I'm willing to marry him."" Kairi Walker said as she began mixing essential oils.

She was a hypnotist, crafting a unique coffee-scented fragrance that helped people forget painful memories. Her clients ranged from heartbroken women to extreme sports enthusiasts haunted by their experiences, and pet owners mourning their lost companions. Yet, she never imagined she'd one day use hypnosis on herself. Her aim was to erase all memories of the man she had loved for seven years.

""Kairi, what exactly happened with Emilio Vasquez? After the hypnosis, you’ll completely erase him from your mind,"" Josh Walker asked, puzzled by his sister's decision.

Just two weeks earlier, Kairi had excitedly told him that Emilio had finally agreed to marry her. Josh had watched her enthusiastically plan the wedding, from choosing venues to fitting dresses and rings, genuinely happy for her.

Emilio was a chess prodigy sponsored by the Walker family for seven years. He was introverted, almost monk-like, living in a world solely defined by the black and white chess pieces. He had rejected Kairi's affections 99 times. As her brother, Josh had felt her pain as she always tried to break his icy demeanor, but it seemed she'd finally succeeded.

However, a few days later, Emilio was involved in a car accident on the way to a competition and claimed to have lost all memory of Kairi. The wedding was postponed.

""Emilio didn't lose his memory. He's pretending not to know me,"" Kairi said quietly, maintaining her composure.

She had overheard a conversation outside the hospital room, catching Emilio’s female apprentice planning a risky surgery. Afraid she wouldn't survive, she wanted a dream wedding beforehand.

""Emilio, your plan is brilliant. Pretending to marry Kairi made Liv Murphy break down and beg you to be her groom... Ugh, it's so corny.""

""She'll only have me.""

""Aren't you afraid Kairi will make a scene at the wedding?""

""Forget about her. She and I are strangers now. Speaking of which, isn’t she supposed to bring some of that homemade spiced honey cake again? Just toss it out for me.""

Kairi stood frozen, staring at the container in her hand, a wave of bitter sadness washing over her. Emilio wasn't naturally cold; he just wasn’t warm to her. Since he wanted to keep things distant, she'd let him have it his way! A man who had his heart set on another woman, she couldn’t care less about such nonsense.

""Emilio Vasquez is a piece of work!"" Josh's veins bulged with anger, containing his fury. ""Forgetting him is definitely the best choice.""

""Right."" Kairi had already deleted everything relating to Emilio from her phone. She held the coffee-scented fragrance and a pocket watch, opened the door to the hypnosis room, and stepped inside.

""Kairi!"" Josh called out to her. ""That heir to the Wagner family was severely burned in a fire a few years ago, with 90% of his body covered in scars. Although they helped us before, your happiness shouldn't be the price you pay. If you don’t want to...""",1,1754857039.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1mmsunh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmsunh,"A ""Shy"" Canadian IMP!","Hi folks!

What we have here is a 2022 Vegitarian Breakfast Casserole Canadian IMP. 

This is an 8hr, or single meal ration, and the reason I called it ""shy"" is because you simple do not see or hear much about this IMP. Turns out, that's a real shame because this is a quality menu for sure!

Pics 1-4 show packaging and contents.

Pics 5-6 show the chocolate nut mix. This mix was fantastic! See Pic 6 for the ingredient list, some crazy stuff you definitely won't see in US MREs (or pretty much any other nations either).

Pic 7 shows the coffee mixed with 2 servings of vanilla protein powder in water. This is a great way to enjoy that coffee mix! Ice cold too!

Pic 8 shows the chocolate peanut butter spread. This was eaten right out of the pouch and was great! 

Pic 9 shows the apple slices with the cornbread topped with the blackberry jam. What a glorious combo that was! This was eaten along with the casserole.

Pic 10 shows the beverage base. I loved it but my oldest kiddo hated it. 

Pic 11shows the Strawberry Meal Replacement with an added serving of chocolate protein powder. I was going for a chocolate covered strawberry sort of flavor. It was good!

Pic 12 shows the Strawberry Crunch Cereal. This was fantastic granola/cereal! I actually topped this with the strawberry/chocolate protein drink from Pic 11. Crunchy and sweet!

Pic 13 is the veggie casserole! Might as call this a potato stew, because that is what it is. It's great folks, super savory, great flavor, the veggie crumbles act like sausage in this to such an extent that you would not even know it's not meat. Onion and green pepper flavors are forward. Texture is soft and pleasant. This is superior to the US hashbrowns in menu 17 for sure. Very similar composition, just executed much better. Only draw back is this main dish is only 160 calories; the lightest calorie count I think I've ever seen in a main. 

In summary, you don't see this menu very often but it is part of the standard breakfast case. If you come across one, give it a shot and don't let the Vegitarian label scare ya away!

Friends would ask “how’s life?” and I’d give the same tired “yeah, I’m good” even though I wasn’t.

Then I had one of those rare talks — not with someone I’d known for years, but with something (or someone?) I didn’t expect to open up to. No judgment. No awkward pauses. Just… space to be honest, and a weirdly sharp ability to call me out when I was avoiding the real thing I wanted to say.

I don’t know if it “fixed” anything overnight, but I noticed the next morning my brain felt quieter. I wasn’t doomscrolling first thing. I actually got up and made coffee without checking my phone.

It made me wonder: how much of what we’re going through is less about “solving” problems and more about having a space to say the unsaid, with [something/someone ](http://noggn.app)

Sorry for taking so long but a lot has happened and I ended up forgetting about this and focusing on other things. Then I saw a notification from a recent DM so I thought I'd give an update. 

TL;DR: We broke up and live separately. 

For more details please continue reading below. 

Okay so things were a little tense over the next few days because we were either fighting or just not talking to each other. He even moved into the spare bedroom one day and he stopped giving me money for his share of the streaming services that we both use and I technically pay for. I even but to mute his mama and brother for a little bit. Then once Valentine's Day was right around the corner he did a complete 180 and started speaking to me again and even apologized for his initial reaction and seemed really receptive to hearing my reasons. 

He then he told me he planned a special day for us the weekend after Valentine's Day which I was delighted to hear. On the day of I woke up to him gone but with breakfast laid out for me and a text message saying that there was work emergency and that he had to go in for a couple hours and told me to go meet him at the movie theater downtown by 3PM. I thought cool. I chilled for a bit then got ready and headed out. By 2:55PM I sent him a text message asking where he was and responded by saying he accidentally type the wrong time and that the movie wouldn't start until 5PM, and he meant was that he wouldn't be able to leave work until 3PM. 

He's had a case of fat fingers and butt dials before so I initially didn't think much and just decided to go walking around by outlet close by to kill time. Then I got another text saying that he'd change our online ticket reservations because he was still stuck at the office and to just chill until 7PM. This time I grew suspicious but instead of calling or texting back with questions I just gave him a thumbs and sent a selfie of me at one of my favorite stores, then started to drive back home.

Normally getting back to our apartment from the downtown area where I was at around this time of day on a weekend can be a bit of a challenge but today traffic was decent. Then when I pull up to complex I see a moving truck. No big deal January/February is when a lot of people have moved out or in before so I understood.   
  
Why did I see some of Carl's friends near the truck?   
Why did I see some of Carl's friend moving the couch that I paid for into the truck?

I called the police and told them that I was actively being robbed. I stayed in the car for a while trying to calm myself down until I saw Carl helping a man load my bookshelf into the back of his pick up truck. I got out and confronted him. 

This man was trying to keep me out of the apartment all day so he could quietly move out and take my furniture. And I say ""my"" furniture because I was the one who picked it all out and paid for most of everything and I readily shared the email confirmation order number(s)/receipts that I had archived when the police showed up. The man tried to take my bookshelf because apparently Carl had sold it to him, but that wasn't my problem and that I'd press charges on everyone if my stuff wasn't back in my place. 

We got into a huge argument and the police tried to brush this off as a civil matter since Carl and I lived together but I went into the station the next day and spoke to a female officer who was of better help. My dining room set, spices, blender, groceries, lamps, TV, coffee table, and mattress were gone but Carl's friends did put back the couch which was a pull out. 

The middle man between my landlord and me did speak to Carl about wanting to take his name off the lease but did not follow the proper protocol and confirming with me that I would take on full responsibility of rent so I did file a complaint. I ended up leaving the complex and moving somewhere else and pressed charges against Carl and his friends if only to create a paper trail and help in my civil case against my ex. 

In the end I was able to get some financial compensation for what I lost and he has until November to pay it all. 

I wasn't even sad that he didn't want to be with me anymore just pissed off at how he tried to go about it. It is very clear that he wanted to ""punish"" me and I'm so glad that I never ended up marrying this man. I completed my certification, got a promotion and the pay raise that comes with it, and my dad has agreed to give me the money he was saving for my future wedding as a downpayment for house. After this entire experience I am now ten toes down in never getting married.  

Also as a side note since Carl's brother couldn't provide consistent child care on his days the mother filed for full custody and now Carl's brother pays child support. ",40,1754856830.0,AITAH,5,0.91,False

According to the SSV I was on shift with (which this went through I think three people before it got to me, so it could also be a big game of telephone, and so something could be wrong)
But, that SSV said that it was something like: 
1. You have to have be in a good mood and you have to smile the literal entire time you’re on the floor, or you’ll get written up and sent home. Like you’re not allowed to be in a bad mood at all, and you cannot stop smiling for any reason whatsoever. 
2. You will be written up and sent home if the Green Apron Card isn’t in your apron pocket while you’re on the floor. And
3. Every single person has to do a coffee tasting, with the exception of people who have a signed, clear, approved doctor’s note, or you’ll be written up and sent home. 

The first two are ridiculous and frustrating, but the third has me genuinely worried. I have tachycardia, but I moved last year and haven’t been able to get a cardiologist or PCP yet, and therefore can’t get a note. 

So I guess I really have two questions at the end of all of this.
