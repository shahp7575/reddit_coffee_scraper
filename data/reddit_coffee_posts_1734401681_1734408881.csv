* My surgical bra had loops for drains, but I hated the plastic drains touching my stomach. I put the drains inside baby socks (or small women's socks), which worked great.
* For drain care, get betadine swabs to clean the drain incisions (check your discharge instructions), 5x9 ABD pads for comfort under your bra (I just wore them three-across), and 2x2 non-woven gauze pads (softer than traditional thready gauze).
* Sterile alcohol wipes were helpful for stripping the drains. Make sure to let air back into the tube before un-pinching to prevent the suction from pulling on your body‚Äîthat part hurts!
* I also found that 1-inch wide non-irritating medical tape helps keep gauze pads in place without itching. I started with our 2-inch tape from our first aid kit but splitting it in half was a pain. Keep some scissors nearby for cutting gauze and tape.
* My surgeon let me use lidocaine cream around the drains after 10 days to ease itching/soreness.

Bras & Clothing

* The surgical bra drove me nuts after a week. I switched to front-close sleep bras (Fruit of the Loom, a size or two up for comfort). I sewed loops of ribbon to these to hold drains.
* I wore plain fitted white cotton tees inside out (Indera brand from Amazon) under my bras to reduce irritation. At four weeks, I switched to spandex camisoles without shelf bras for seamless comfort.
* If you're buying post-surgery shirts, three button-up or zip-front options are plenty. Comfy, loose-fitting button-downs you already own (or borrow) work too. The real key to any non-front-button shirt is sideways stretch so you can get your arms in easily.

Staying Clean Without Showering

* A bidet was my MVP, especially when constipation hit around days 4-6 or during the no-shower period. It kept me feeling clean and fresh.
* Non-rinse bathing cloths, Lume wipes, dry shampoo, and hair washes at a salon (around days 5 and 9) were lifesavers. If washing your hair at home, look into capes or waterproof wraps to avoid water issues.
* I didn‚Äôt shower until my drains were out, but my husband hosed my lower half down once or twice, which I could have done alone.

Bedside Setup

* Whatever table you use next to your bed, make sure it‚Äôs tall (bed height or higher) and big enough for all your stuff. If it‚Äôs too low, leaning down will be harder than it should be.
* Use cord holders to keep chargers and wires from falling to the floor. If you're doing DIEP, get a grabber.
* If you‚Äôre sleeping at an angle (on a wedge pillow or adjustable bed), two 10-12 inch square pillows by your neck/shoulders are perfect for resting your face without pushing your head up too much.
* Keep a notebook and pen nearby to track meds and symptoms.

Pre-Surgery Prep

* Start leaving items you use regularly (coffee mugs, mouthwash, clothes, extra toilet paper, chapstick, etc.) at counter height a week before surgery to avoid reaching up or bending down post-op.
* Arrange your fridge so frequently-used items are front and center.
* Stock up on protein-rich foods (yogurt, protein shakes, etc.) because your appetite might be low, and you‚Äôll need every bite to count.
* Take fiber supplements (like Benefiber) the week before surgery and start laxatives (not Colace‚Äîit‚Äôs useless) as soon as you‚Äôre home to keep things moving.

Recovery Mindset & Energy

* Rest more than you think you need. Even when you feel good, energy spent doing anything other than healing slows your recovery.
* Walk and move around, but don‚Äôt try to be a hero. Don‚Äôt dust the shelves or take on unnecessary tasks just to prove a point.
* The week leading up to surgery is stressful. Allow yourself to relax if you can, and stay in that relaxed mindset during recovery. Give yourself permission to be a slug.
* Plan lots of easy-to-do entertainment (shows, podcasts, video games). You probably won‚Äôt focus on books or work for a few days. Something engrossing like a video game or a show you love can really distract you from the pain. Binge away, guilt-free.

Miscellaneous Tips

* If you only have one surgical bra, make time to wash it (even if you sit bra-less for a bit) to avoid it smelling, which can feel demoralizing. (Find out from your surgeon when you can ditch the surgical bra, that was heavenly. For me it was day 6.)
* Have lots of water nearby. If your bedroom isn‚Äôt close to the kitchen, get a 2-gallon water dispenser.
* I bought a wrap-around post-surgery pillow but only used it in the car. A soft throw pillow would have been fine. Six weeks out I use a small pillow that straps to my seatbelt.
* If your surgeon allows, ask for discharge instructions in advance so you can stock up on any supplies they require. We had to send someone out to the pharmacy to get a bunch of things.",1,1734407417.0,u_ObjectSmall,0,1.0,False

1hg1xfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hg1xfw/finally_figured_out_a_recipe_for_extralarge_doses/,Finally figured out a recipe for extra-large doses in a conical dripper with a low end grinder,"I spent a few months working on a recipe that doesn‚Äôt stall for 60-70g of coffee, doesn‚Äôt have astringency, and still has bright acidity so figured I‚Äôd share in case it helps someone. I have a Capresso Infinity Grinder.

My current recipe:
6 cup Chemex
Chemex Filter Brew Clip (any other method like straw, chopstick, etc will work)
Hario v60 03 untabbed filter papers (bleached or unbleached)
63g Coffee per Liter Water
Boiling Water
Medium-Coarse Grind Setting

1st Pour:
Half the water, basically the Tales Coffee single pour technique. Pour slowly down the middle, ride the bloom, first drip at 20 seconds. Because it only used half the water compared to Tales, pour is completely down the middle, then stir aggressively and let it draw down. 

The reason I think this helps is the water level rises from the bottom and wets the coffee bottom to top, pushing the fines up. The stir then pushes the fines to the sides of the filter paper. I never get stalls. Additionally, the large amount of water in the bloom pour and the early agitation improve the bright acidity.

2nd Pour

Rest of the water (leave it to cool naturally)poured through the gabi b dripper (equally from middle and outter chamber). Slight Rao Swirl to even bed at end as it draws down. 

The reason I think this works is it decreases agitation and temperature for the second phase (like the tetsu devil recipe) to prevent astringency. The coffee chronicler has a lot of recipes like this with the gabi. Also, because the chemex is a minimal bypass brewer, the astringent compounds are filtered out by the coffee bed that is left undisturbed by the gabi b dripper (‚Äúthe mechanism behind astringency in coffee‚Äù by jonathan gagne). I also think because the chemex has such long contact time you get a little bit of the percolation/immersion taste.

Total brew time: 6 minutes

I exclusively pump so having him help at night helped to take some of the burden off of me. 

Incident 1: I was up pumping while he simultaneously fed our son. I caught him falling asleep while feeding/holding our son. After this my PPA spiraled and I took over all night feedings. He begged me to learn to trust him again. This was very difficult for me. He sought out advice for staying awake during night feedings and we switched to him doing a night and then me doing a night and vice versa so we‚Äôd each get one night of uninterrupted (well him as I still have to get up and pump) sleep before a night shift . All was well for a while. But then that brings me to incident 2‚Ä¶.

Incident 2: I came out to do my MOTN pump after having been up with our sick toddler. I found him fast asleep with our son‚Äôs face PRESSED into the sofa. I flipped out and have been doing the night shift ever since. 

My trust in him has been completely violated and I‚Äôm kicking myself for trusting him again. My PPA is so bad after this and I cannot get the image of coming out to seeing our son in a dangerous situation. I‚Äôm really struggling with extreme resentment knowing he gets full nights of rest and I‚Äôm running myself into the ground trying to keep our son safe. I will typically drink a coffee before I go to bed so I don‚Äôt wake up drowsy when our son wakes. He‚Äôs up anywhere from 1-2 times a night but the broken sleep is killer when it comes to be morning and I have an infant and toddler to care for. 
I also work a very intellectually demanding job twice a week (but long hours) and my fatigue is impacting my work. I‚Äôm able to nap when my husband comes home from work for like an hr and on the weekends but that alone isn‚Äôt going to solve things‚Äîif I sleep then I miss out on time with my kids. But if I don‚Äôt sleep, I run myself into the ground even more. 


How the heck do I get past my resentment? I cannot trust him again as I fear that our son won‚Äôt be safe. I feel so alone knowing I don‚Äôt have backup at night as my husband has proven twice that he is not reliable or safe at night when caring for our child. I don‚Äôt want to keep feeling this way.

Hi everyone,



I have an oak desk with veneered tops and a grey stain done by a carpenter last summer. I noticed staining quite quickly like a ring of coffee or a dab of grease on it that wouldn't come off with an all purpose cleaner, reached out to the carpenter, and he came back to sand and restain it again. At this point there are patches on the desk that I think seem like it wasn't sealed well - obvious whiter patches/non-shiny spots. 



Tonight, I just noticed a small patch of this pattern and when I removed my mouse pad, unfortunately [this](https://imgur.com/WsJyn7B) was under it and no my camera isn't shaking, that's literally what it looks like! I've tried a toothbrush with an all purpose cleaner which doesn't do anything. I scraped it with my nail but it just looks like I'm taking the finish off (whiter patch and the pattern is still there). We happened to have another carpenter in doing some other work and he said the workmanship was poor on the desk, and the previous carpenter shouldn't have used a water-based stain. 



At this point, should I just re-sand the whole desk and hopefully this comes off, and stain then seal? I really didn't think my mouse pad would do this damage as I've got a wrist rest and there's nothing under that. Any advice super appreciated!",2,1734406308.0,Carpentry,0,1.0,False

A good friend of mine recommended a few supplements that changed everything. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much at first, but this  stack has made a huge difference for me:

1. **L-Theanine** ‚Äì I take 200mg in the morning with my coffee. It smooths out the caffeine jitters and gives me this calm focus that lasts most of the day.
2. **Taurine** ‚Äì 1g in the afternoon, especially when stress starts piling up. It‚Äôs subtle, but it takes the edge off in a way I can really feel.
3. **Ashwagandha** ‚Äì 500mg at night (I use KSM-66). My sleep has never been better, and I wake up actually feeling rested for once.

‚ÄúOh, sure, moving in with a friend sounded like a great idea. We‚Äôd split the rent, have movie nights, cook together‚Äîtotal sitcom vibes, right? Wrong. So, so wrong.

First of all, they‚Äôre allergic to doing dishes. I don‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre bad at it; I mean they‚Äôve got an actual aversion. There‚Äôs a science experiment growing in the sink, and I‚Äôm not qualified to deal with it. Last week, I found a spoon stuck to a plate with‚Ä¶ something unidentifiable. Like, was it peanut butter? Glue? A biohazard? No idea.

Then there‚Äôs the noise. I thought I was getting a quiet roommate. Nope. At 2 a.m., they‚Äôre watching YouTube tutorials on how to yodel. At full volume. YODEL. Why? Because they ‚Äúmight visit Switzerland one day.‚Äù Switzerland?! They can‚Äôt even afford rent half the time!

Oh, and speaking of money‚Äîremember when we said we‚Äôd split groceries? Yeah, apparently that means I buy everything, and they eat it. I came home the other day, excited for the slice of cheesecake I saved from my birthday. Guess where it was? Gone. And their excuse? ‚ÄòOh, I thought you wouldn‚Äôt mind.‚Äô Oh, I mind. I mind so much I had to go scream into my pillow.

But the best one? They talk to my plants. I‚Äôm serious. I walked in, and they were giving a pep talk to my cactus, Jerry. Like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great, buddy. Keep reaching for the sun.‚Äù Jerry looked traumatized. I mean, he‚Äôs a cactus. He doesn‚Äôt need emotional support!

So, yeah, living with my best friend? Big mistake. Huge. But what am I gonna do? Kick them out? No. Because despite all of this‚Ä¶ they still bring me coffee when I‚Äôm having a bad day. And last week, they helped me ace my job interview by pretending to be my boss for practice. They might drive me insane, but they‚Äôre my insane. I just wish they‚Äôd do their dishes.‚Äù

**HIGHLIGHTS**

* [I hate satanists and I don't want them to have freedoms or freedom of speech unless they become normal human beings](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2d3vse/)

   * The normal human beings who drinks the blood and eats the flesh of their demigod while wearing a miniature version of a tool of torture on their necks? Those normal human beings?

      * He‚Äôs not a demigod, that‚Äôs a pagan invention, there‚Äôs no such thing as a demigod

    * Replace Satanists with Christians in that sentence.  See the problem?  Or let‚Äôs try any other religion‚Ä¶
           
        * They‚Äôre inherently abnormal so it‚Äôs obvious that holding them to the same standard makes no sense

            * Sure, they're abnormal compared to christians, seeing how they acknowledge that mystical sky daddies aren't a thing

                * Go to r/stupidcomebacks this comment suits them better

* [Satanists are just people who were raised catholic and wanted to be different so bad that they just did the opposite of everything they were told. Satanism is literally just anti Christianity](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2dvytx/)

   * Hardly.  THERE ARE SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL TENETS: I. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.  II. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.  III.  One‚Äôs body is inviolable, subject to one‚Äôs own will alone.  IV.  The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one‚Äôs own.  V.  Beliefs should conform to one‚Äôs best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one‚Äôs beliefs.  VI.  People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one‚Äôs best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.  VII. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.

      * Oh so it‚Äôs Christianity for liberals, got it

           * please elaborate

       * Diddy didn't follow any of these lol.

          * TF does Diddy have to do with this?

             * Diddy is a literal Satanist, Hollywood is full of them, Esptein, Weinstein, etc. and what was the result? The me too movement, mass rape accusations, arrests, etc.

   * Aka Hollywood. It doesn't mean they grow up moral or righteous, Hollywood is TEEMING with literal Satanists & they're accused of doing some heinous shit.

        * Put that tinfoil hat on

             * https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/diddys-meticulous-records-enough-to-hang-half-of-hollywood-excl/ 

                  * I didn‚Äôt see any mention of Satanism in there. But it looks like he‚Äôs perfectly qualified to be a children‚Äôs pastor at an evangelical church.


* [Lmao the hypocrisy is insane. The amount of hate against Christians I see everyday even on Reddit and then you folks make the argument we have religious freedom? Stfu bunch of insane hypocrites on this app](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2daxgo/)

   * Religious freedom has nothing to do with people‚Äôs opinion about the religion.  People are free to be Christians, and people are free to call Christians out for being hateful and vile.  What‚Äôs the problem?

     * Then people can call out that they don‚Äôt like satanic symbols.  Because to them that religion is hateful and vile.  What‚Äôs the problem?

         * There‚Äôs no problem with that. What are you talking about?

* [Brought to you by the people who want KKK rallies to be protected by free speech](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2dceu0/)

   * They are and should be. Free speech is free speech as long as it doesn't verge into calls to violence.  Now on the other hand, if people lose their jobs because they march in such things, well, that's just too bad.

        * Calling for the extermination of an entire group of people is not ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù, dipshit.

        * Wasn‚Äôt asking your opinion. Just stating the truth

             * Good for you, bud. You found the point that the ACLU and the skinheads agree on. Your insight is stunning.

* [Disgusting ANY religion is on display in any govt building](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2dy2uc/)

   * You clearly don‚Äôt understand what TST or TSC stands for.

        * Satanic temple/church.  So what?  The perceived legitimacy of the religion is of no concern to me. Whether the primary purpose of a display is meant in protest is of little concern.   None of this shit has any place in govt begin with, is the point

            * Isnt that the whole shtick with the TST in the US though?  Like your agreeing with them.

* [Reddit totally united in support of satan](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2e7hxb/)

   * I mean, their priests don‚Äôt rape kids, so by every measure they‚Äôre better.

       * Wow so edgy and cool

          * Simply factual. I‚Äôm sorry you chose the more evil religion.

* [Satanism isn't a religion. They only exist as a mockery of Christianity. All of their symbols are taken from Christianity and used in satire.  To do this to any other group would be considered bigoted.](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2eah1d/)

   * If you think the tenets of the TST, such as trust sciece, be kind, prioritise justice over the status quo are a ""mockery"" of Christianity that says a lot more about Christianity than it does TST.

       * ""Trust science"" is what ignoramuses who don't understand science say.

           * Of course someone who posts in the domestic terrorist sub has a problem with science.

* [It‚Äôs not a real religion though and most of the members would tell you the same. It‚Äôs a meta commentary on religion, they don‚Äôt actually believe in Satan.](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2dinnd/)

   * Christianity isn‚Äôt a real religion. It‚Äôs a cult used to hide money and pedophiles.

       * This take is so terminally online it's insane, please, I really recommend trying to tell this to anyone in your family and friends and see if they have the same reaction as reddit.

            * I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong and there‚Äôs data to prove it.

               * You can use data to prove a lot of things that aren't correct. Like the infamous black statistic, you know the one. Yes, the raw data says this, but that's just raw data. Black people do more crime, because black people have less generational wealth because of slavery, so they have less money, so they have to do crime, but then crime sends you to jail and you don't have any money coming out of jail... Negative feedback loop.  Yes, more pedophiles are priests, but more pedophiles are teachers too. It's a job with power over children, you're sadly going to have that. Could I say I fucking hate gym teachers because more gym teachers are pedophiles then average office workers? 
 Also cult used to hide money is stupid. Like yes, you got morons donating to mega churches. But you can't SERIOUSLY look at your local town church that your mother attends every sunday and tell her ""Ummm mummy, Christianity is bad, the genius enlightened in their own intelligence Reddit R Atheists 14 year olds said they're evil!""  Like come on. Please talk to someone in real life about your opinion on this. Reddit usually holds very different values.

* [Satanism is not a real religion. it's just taking the piss at Christianity. No surprise Christians are going to find it offensive. That's the point. If there were some inverse aimed at any other religion, it wouldn't be tolerated. The West is just happy at pissing on their own neighbors' beliefs while tip toeing around foreign beliefs.](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2e0e6w/)

   * You're actually delusional if you think people don't take the piss out of other religions.

      * Not half as often as they do in the US at Christians lets be real here, lol  Leftists are super pro toward muslim faith even thou muslims are far more conservative than christians. It's not even logical.

         * I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúleftists‚Äù would push back harder on Islam if the overwhelming majority of our congress members were Islamic and many of them were trying to impose their religious beliefs into laws.

             * It's ok it doesnt matter. Many jews and muslims both are being forced towards voting for republicans because democrats have pushed too hard on issues that they also care about. Liberals often THINK they are attacking just Christians, but most religions hold similar values, and all religious people are moving right.

* [Atheists get triggered by a Christmas tree so they start putting up statues of Satan and Baphomet in protest. Apparently a largely corporate and cultural holiday is just so triggering and unacceptable that these people need to insult other religions. Do you know how many atheists, Jews, Hindus, etc celebrate Christmas? As in putting up a tree, giving gifts, etc. Really pathetic stuff that Satanists have to make a scene all the time.](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2dxi0m/)

   * I didn‚Äôt know loving my gods in public was an insult to yours

       * A Christmas tree isn‚Äôt a god. If they put a menorah or a Jesus statue in a state capital, maybe I can see your frustration. But do you really get offended by a tree that basically just represents ‚Äúpresents‚Äù?

   * we sure do because trees and gift giving is based on paganism and the solstice. show me where in the bible they decorate a tree for jesus‚Äôs not actual birthday?

       * Don‚Äôt be such a troll. It has nothing to do with religion.

           * what are you taking about- i just said those things are not religious symbols of Christmas - they‚Äôre pagan rituals.

* [Liberals are ok with anything else besides Christianity not shocking](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2ez2f2/)

   * Hilarious this is your takeaway.

      * All the comments would back it up

          * Maybe Christians should try to be less shitty and judgemental people instead of trying actively to harm minorities and people wouldn't have as much of a problem with them.

* [A free country founded on Christian values](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2ev5n9/)

  * Might want to go back and take that middle school civics class.

      * ‚ÄúEndowed by their Creator‚Äù, I‚Äôll do that once you read the declaration of independence

         * I can feel the misplaced smugness through the screen. Want me to give you more time to think that through?

             * Explain how America was not founded on Christian values then

* [Christians invited this when they wanted to display the Ten Commandments in a state capitol and in schools. They also invited this when states started buying bibles to teach to young children.  Leave the kids alone. We don‚Äôt need you shoving your ideas down their throats. I don‚Äôt care what you do at home in your personal life, but kids shouldn‚Äôt be groomed like this in public schools. Save the children.](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2d32yt/)

   * ""Leave the kids alone."" Oh, the irony

       * https://www.ministryinsured.com/church-insurance/liability/abuse-molestation/

           * Look up how much more often teachers sexually abuse their students

           *  OMFG they sell insurance for that? You gotta be kidding me.

   * same goes for trans ideologies keep it all away from the kids, imo

       * Why? There's nothing even remotely harmful about it, and nobody is forcing it on any kids, the ones doing that are the super religious people

           * Tell that to a detransitioner.

* [Free country for me, but not for thee.](https://np.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1hfmy43/i_thought_it_was_a_free_country/m2cmbtj/)

   * Just because it‚Äôs free doesn‚Äôt mean we should put a swaztika in a State capitol. Or openly support Hades/Satan/Alternative gods of destruction and chaos.

      * A swaztika represents a political party, has nothing to do with freedom of religion.

         * Premise stands regardless of category.  Satan represents or otherwise supports all things ""bad."" The swastika represents a political party surrounded by ""bad"" principles and values. They are complementary to one another. Like coffee and sugar, where Satan is coffee and a swastika is sugar if that's easier to understand. They do not disagree with each other, they'd be best friends. 
 Bad as in net loss for society.

            * Im not the one having difficulty understanding. A very good argument can be made that all organized religion has been and is a net loss for society at large. So your argument is still nonsense.

                * A very good argument? lol Religion is largely the only reason large-scale societies exist. Literally every large society that thas ever existed has a large religious footprint that their moral compass is heavily founded on. In almost every scenario, religion is a massive net positive to society. The only cases it could be net negative isn't even due to religion itself, it's due to the people who misuse it. Just like weapons are a net positive to society, imagine us trying to defend ourselves from lions and tigers with nothing but fists. The weapons themselves aren't bad, the way you use it is. People are bad long before religion enters the conversation, religion is what redirects the bad towards the good.",19,1734405706.0,SubredditDrama,17,0.85,False
1hg1hlh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hg1hlh,Christmas keepsake box‚Äôs for nieces and nephews ,"Here are some scrap wood box‚Äôs I made for my neices and nephews this year for the holiday.

#1 is made from white Oak with mitred corners and a full grain wrap, and a suuuper figured big leaf maple top insert.

#2 and #3 are made from the most highly figured piece of maple that I have ever seen, I tried to do mitred grain wraps on these also but the amount of figure caused the sides to warp a bit so instead of having gappy 45¬∞s I decided to do rebates instead. And the black epoxy holes are from trying to use Amazon barrel hinges and them falling apart after install (lesson learned. Always buy quality soss barrel hinges).
so I decided to use old and trust narrow brass hinges instead.

#4 is an offcut from a coffee table I‚Äôm working on which is western big leaf maple with a walnut piece in the top and bottom for the lid and base.

#5 is a little bit of figured walnut and repurposed skateboard to form the frame on top of the inside lid, and as added thickness for the screws from the hinges because I accidentally went a little to thin while splitting and planing this 4/4 material. But I think it turned out good for a last minute scrap project for kids. 

Everything was sanded up to 180 then used ‚Äúsaicos satin hardwax oil‚Äù, after 12 hours I lightly sanded with 320 grit to make everything soft to touch and used saicos hardwax again for 2 coats for a total of 3. Everything feels like a smooth rock.

[The Piper](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/A2wCjXNxLJ)

[Wires and Chains](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/cwT13Z3ZuE)

Hey everyone, it‚Äôs Glenn Matsuri again‚Äî

I‚Äôve been on a break. A real break this time. After everything with Naamah‚Äîand then Moloch again‚ÄîI promised myself I‚Äôd live life on my own terms for a while.

I never wrote about when I went back for Moloch, though it felt like I should. Maybe that‚Äôs because it didn‚Äôt feel like much of a story. Not compared to Naamah, or the Piper. Moloch was‚Ä¶ easier. Too easy.

Six months after I sealed Naamah, I started thinking about that statue. The cult‚Äôs idol, the massive figure I saw in that warehouse when all this started. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it was unfinished. It haunted me like a splinter just under the skin‚Äîsomething I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

So I went back.

The warehouse was the same. Abandoned, silent, and stagnant, as though time had stopped there. I don‚Äôt know what I expected‚Äîsome cultists waiting in the dark, maybe, or some fight for my soul‚Äîbut all I found was dust and decay.

And there it was.

The idol.

It sat in the center of the room on its crumbling altar, still grotesque and imposing even in the faint light filtering through broken windows. Moloch‚Äôs form was carved into rough, ancient stone, half-man, half-bull. His massive shoulders hunched forward as though bearing the weight of his own cruelty. His head‚Äîa bull‚Äôs head with hollow, gaping eyes and curled horns‚Äîstared forward, unseeing but aware.

It didn‚Äôt feel dormant. Not really. It felt like something was watching me through those empty sockets, waiting.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was doing at first. I brought Naamah‚Äôs piece‚Äîthe obsidian Queen‚Äîbecause instinct told me to. The pieces‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, they teach you things, in a way that‚Äôs hard to explain.

I approached the idol, the silence thick around me, and I placed the Queen at its feet.

At first, nothing happened. But as I focused‚Äîon the idol, on Moloch himself‚ÄîI felt it. The air shifted, the room vibrating with an almost imperceptible hum. It was like the stone statue breathed, just once, before going still again.

Then, a crack.

A hairline fracture split across the idol‚Äôs chest, spreading with a sharp, audible pop. And I felt something pull.

I don‚Äôt know if Moloch resisted. Maybe he never saw me coming, or maybe he didn‚Äôt care. But I knew what was happening as the obsidian King took shape in my hand. It was cold‚Äîcolder than the Queen had ever been‚Äîand its sharp edges pressed into my skin like it was warning me not to hold it for too long.

The hum faded. The room went still.

I looked up, and the idol was empty. Hollow.

Just like that, Moloch was bound.

I walked out of that warehouse with the King in my pocket, feeling like I‚Äôd gotten away with something. I expected blowback. You don‚Äôt just waltz in and snare a demon that‚Äôs been feared for millennia. But nothing happened. Days passed, then weeks, then months. Now, it‚Äôs been three years.

The King sits beside the Queen on my shelf. Two obsidian pieces, small and silent, but heavy in ways I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever fully understand.

In those three years, I bought a house. An actual house this time, not some cramped apartment. Avery, my girlfriend, moved in about a year ago, and life finally started to feel like it was mine again.

Sometimes she asks me about the pieces. About the Piper, Naamah, or if I ever think there‚Äôs more out there. ‚ÄúYou should take me with you next time,‚Äù she‚Äôll say, half-joking but not really joking at all. I‚Äôm not sure she truly believes me, despite her claiming to. 

For a long time, I laughed her off. I told her I was on a break. I told myself I was done chasing things that were better left unseen.

But lately, things have started to feel‚Ä¶ wrong.

Little things. Scratching sounds outside the house at night. Lights flickering in rooms no one‚Äôs been in. A smell‚Äîsharp, faint, like woodsmoke mixed with something sweeter, like flowers or incense.

Two nights ago, I woke up to a shadow moving outside the window. It wasn‚Äôt human‚Äîits movements were too fluid, too unnatural. I sat up, but by the time I looked, it was gone.

I know something‚Äôs coming.

And for the first time in years, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to laugh Avery off.

The first time I sensed it, I was alone in the house. Avery was out visiting her sister for the weekend, and for the first time in years, the silence felt‚Ä¶ off.

It started with the sound.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

It was faint at first, like claws against glass. I froze mid-typing in my office, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The tap-tap-tapping came again, deliberate and slow, from the direction of the living room window.

I turned my head toward the sound. It stopped.

The lights were still on, but suddenly, the house felt darker. Thicker. I stood up slowly and made my way toward the living room. The tapping didn‚Äôt return, but my pulse thundered in my ears. I flipped on the light switch, and the room lit up in an empty, quiet stillness.

Nothing.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair. You‚Äôre hearing things. I turned toward the kitchen‚Äî

Tap.

The sound came from the floor. Right behind me.

I whipped around, heart lurching, and there it was.

A fox.

It was small‚Äîno larger than a housecat‚Äîbut it stood upright on its hind legs like it was perfectly natural. Its fur was snow-white, soft and clean, and behind it were tails‚Äînine of them‚Äîfanning out in slow, lazy motions like drifting silk. It stood there on two legs, its tiny paws folded behind its back as it stared up at me with glowing amber eyes.

I didn‚Äôt move.

It blinked at me, cocking its head to one side like it was studying me. Then it grinned.

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù it said cheerfully.

I nearly tripped over the coffee table. ‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî!‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, rude.‚Äù The fox‚Äôs voice was light and sing-song, like it was scolding me for knocking over a vase. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think after everything you‚Äôve seen, a talking fox wouldn‚Äôt be such a shock.‚Äù

I stared at it. It stared back, ears twitching.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù I managed, my voice shaking slightly.

It took a dainty step forward on two legs, still unnervingly small and fox-like. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Kitsune, of course! You‚Äôre Glenn Matsuri, right? I‚Äôve been looking for you.‚Äù

I took a step back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve what?‚Äù

The little creature nodded, its tails swishing. ‚ÄúOh yes, you‚Äôve made a bit of a reputation for yourself. Naamah? Moloch? That‚Äôs some big business to get tangled up in. And now here you are, living in this nice little house with your girlfriend, playing normal.‚Äù

The fox said it casually, like it knew everything about me. My grip tightened on the doorframe. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you want, but I‚Äôm not interested. I didn‚Äôt ask for any of that.‚Äù

Kitsune let out a dramatic sigh and sat back on its haunches, still upright. It shook its tiny head, as though I‚Äôd just said something laughably stupid. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to poke around the unknown, Glenn, and then get mad when the unknown pokes back at you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how this works‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly how this works,‚Äù it interrupted brightly. ‚ÄúAnd lucky for you, I‚Äôm not here to haunt you. I‚Äôm here because I need your help.‚Äù

I stared at it. ‚ÄúHelp?‚Äù

The fox‚Äôs grin widened, and it took another slow step forward. ‚ÄúWord gets around, Glenn. The demons you‚Äôve dealt with? Bound up nice and neat? I hear you‚Äôre pretty good at it.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good at it. I just‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äîsurvived it? Yeah, yeah, that‚Äôs what they all say.‚Äù Kitsune waved a paw dismissively. ‚ÄúLook, you‚Äôve got a gift, okay? And I‚Äôve got a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd love to tell you, but first‚Ä¶‚Äù Kitsune sniffed the air and tilted its head, the amber glow in its eyes brightening. ‚ÄúDo you have tea? Or snacks? I‚Äôm starving.‚Äù

I blinked at it, my jaw slack. ‚ÄúSnacks?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, snacks,‚Äù it repeated cheerfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been traveling a long way to find you, and I‚Äôm absolutely famished. It‚Äôs the least you can offer before I explain why your perfectly normal life is about to get less normal.‚Äù

The absurdity of the moment finally hit me, and I couldn‚Äôt help it. I laughed‚Äîsharp, dry, and disbelieving. ‚ÄúNo. No way. You‚Äôre joking.‚Äù

Kitsune just tilted its head again, expression perfectly serious despite the playfulness in its tone. ‚ÄúDo I look like I‚Äôm joking?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt deny it: despite the glowing eyes, the multiple tails, and the fact that it had broken into my house, it was‚Ä¶ oddly cute. Like a stuffed animal someone had animated with pure sass and unsettling wisdom.

I sighed and rubbed a hand over my face. ‚ÄúFine. You can have tea. But you‚Äôre explaining everything.‚Äù

The fox‚Äôs ears perked up, and its tails swished excitedly. ‚ÄúDeal!‚Äù

It trotted past me on two legs like it owned the place, heading straight for the kitchen. I followed behind, still trying to wrap my head around what was happening.

As I put the kettle on, I glanced back at Kitsune, who had perched itself on the counter. It looked at me, its grin returning.

‚ÄúOh, Glenn,‚Äù it teased softly, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really going to regret being so hospitable.‚Äù

I muttered under my breath, ‚ÄúI already do.‚Äù

But deep down, I knew: whatever this was, it wasn‚Äôt leaving anytime soon.

I made tea for the Kitsune. It was ridiculous, all of it‚Äîboiling water, steeping leaves, and pouring a cup for a magical talking fox with nine tails sitting on my kitchen counter like it belonged there.

‚ÄúIs chamomile okay?‚Äù I asked, setting the cup down in front of her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got.‚Äù

The fox‚Äôs tails swished lazily as she leaned forward, inhaling the steam with a pleased sigh. ‚ÄúChamomile‚Äôs perfect. You‚Äôre a good host, Glenn. It‚Äôs no wonder she lets you wield her power.‚Äù

That caught me off guard. I blinked. ‚ÄúShe?‚Äù

Kitsune waved a paw, dismissing the question. ‚ÄúNever mind, we‚Äôll get there.‚Äù

As I leaned against the counter, watching the little fox sip tea‚Äîstill upright on two legs‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt help but remark, ‚ÄúYou know, Henry had fox butlers in his manor back in Naamah‚Äôs world. They wore tuxedos and everything. You wouldn‚Äôt happen to be related, would you?‚Äù

The Kitsune perked her ears up, tilting her head with mock seriousness. ‚ÄúOh, absolutely. Distant cousins. Long family line of excellent service.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I asked, surprised despite myself.

The fox‚Äôs expression went deadpan, her bright orange eyes staring flatly into mine. ‚ÄúNo. Not really.‚Äù

I felt my face flush. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

She snickered into her tea, clearly pleased with herself, then set the cup down delicately. ‚ÄúAlright, enough tea and chit-chat. Let‚Äôs talk business.‚Äù

‚ÄúBusiness,‚Äù I echoed. ‚ÄúSure, let‚Äôs hear it.‚Äù

She hopped down from the counter, tails trailing behind her as she paced the kitchen floor like a professor delivering a lecture. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Wendigo up in the mountains, Glenn. It‚Äôs a nasty piece of work, and it‚Äôs causing all sorts of trouble. People disappearing, settlements going quiet, that sort of thing. I want it gone. Sealed away. And you‚Äôre going to help me.‚Äù

I frowned, still trying to process the words. ‚ÄúHold on‚Äîa Wendigo? Why are you asking me for help? You‚Äôre, you know‚Ä¶‚Äù I gestured at her tails, her glowing eyes. ‚Äú‚Ä¶a Kitsune. Aren‚Äôt you powerful enough to deal with it yourself?‚Äù

She stopped pacing and gave me a look‚Äîone that made me feel like I‚Äôd just asked if water was wet. ‚ÄúPowerful? Sure. But this isn‚Äôt just some random Wendigo. This one‚Äôs personal.‚Äù

‚ÄúPersonal?‚Äù

Her tails stilled, her gaze flickering for just a moment before returning to that same mischievous glint. ‚ÄúWe Kitsune don‚Äôt like Wendigos. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ complicated lore stuff. Let‚Äôs just say Wendigos exist because of imbalance, desperation, and corruption‚Äîall things I hate. Plus, this one‚Äôs been targeting people under my protection.‚Äù

I crossed my arms. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs stopping you from handling it on your own?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt seal things, Glenn.‚Äù She pointed a paw at me. ‚ÄúYou do.‚Äù

The room went quiet for a moment as her words sank in. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, I do?‚Äù

Kitsune sighed, like I was being slow. ‚ÄúYou sealed Naamah. You sealed Moloch. And you didn‚Äôt get yourself infected with demonic rot doing it, either. Which means you‚Äôre special. Or dumb. Or both.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for any of that,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúWell, congratulations, you‚Äôve got a gift. And she lets you use it,‚Äù Kitsune said, hopping back onto the counter.

‚ÄúShe?‚Äù I repeated again.

‚ÄúNaamah,‚Äù she said, grinning with all her teeth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using her power, whether you like it or not.‚Äù

My blood went cold. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, but it is,‚Äù Kitsune chirped, sipping her tea again. ‚ÄúNot directly, mind you. Probably passive. Involuntary. She‚Äôs a chess piece now, remember? Bound up tight. You‚Äôve got the leash, so you‚Äôve got the power.‚Äù

I looked toward my office, where the Queen and King pieces sat. ‚ÄúWhy would she let me do that?‚Äù

Kitsune‚Äôs grin widened. ‚ÄúWho says she‚Äôs letting you? She‚Äôs a demon in a box, Glenn. She doesn‚Äôt have much say in the matter.‚Äù

The room fell silent again as I stared at her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look so freaked out,‚Äù she said, waving a paw dismissively. ‚ÄúIf you had demonic rot, we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation. You‚Äôre clean. Well‚Ä¶‚Äù She squinted at me, her tails flicking thoughtfully. ‚Äú‚Ä¶mostly clean. Your soul‚Äôs already claimed, anyway.‚Äù

I tensed. ‚ÄúBy who?‚Äù

Her eyes gleamed, and she leaned closer, her grin positively smug. ‚ÄúThe Piper, of course.‚Äù

The room felt colder. I swallowed hard.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a joke.‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúAnyway, back to the matter at hand.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôve been pulling off this‚Ä¶ sealing thing with Naamah‚Äôs power?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Handy, huh?‚Äù Kitsune set her empty cup down and hopped onto the table, tails twitching. ‚ÄúLook, here‚Äôs the deal: this Wendigo is causing chaos, and I want it snared. I can‚Äôt seal it. You can. So let‚Äôs team up, and we‚Äôll solve both our problems.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you care so much about this particular Wendigo?‚Äù I asked, narrowing my eyes.

Her expression faltered for just a second‚Äîso quick I almost missed it. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say Wendigos‚Ä¶ offend me. Everything about them‚Äîtheir hunger, their corruption‚Äîit‚Äôs like watching a sickness that spreads and never stops. They‚Äôre unnatural. An imbalance in the world. This one is worse than most. I can‚Äôt just let it run wild.‚Äù

Her voice was still playful, but something sharper hid beneath the surface.

I stared at her for a long moment, trying to gauge just how much of the truth she was telling me. ‚ÄúAnd if I say no?‚Äù

Kitsune tilted her head, her grin returning. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to say no. But we both know you won‚Äôt. This is what you do, Glenn. You see something wrong, and you fix it‚Äîwhether you like it or not.‚Äù

She hopped down from the table, landing on her hind legs with an unsettling little bounce. ‚ÄúSo what do you say, partner? Ready to bag yourself a Wendigo?‚Äù

I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to make this miserable for me, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Her tails swished, and she beamed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù

Somehow, I already knew I wasn‚Äôt getting out of this.

‚ÄúWhat if I say no?‚Äù I asked, my voice sharper than I meant it to be.

The room shifted.

The Kitsune, up until now lighthearted and joking, froze mid-step. Her tails went still. The playful glow in her amber eyes dimmed, and her grin flattened into something unnervingly neutral. It was like watching a flame suddenly snuffed out, leaving only smoke and silence.

‚ÄúLeast you forget, Glenn,‚Äù she said softly, her voice low and deliberate, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm capable of haunting too.‚Äù

Her form began to change.

The fur along her small, fox-like body rippled unnaturally, as though something larger‚Äîsomething wrong‚Äîwas trying to force its way to the surface. Her limbs stretched and twitched, thin and too long, her silhouette suddenly looming larger in the dim kitchen light. Her tails snapped and curled like serpents, their movements erratic. Her face stayed fox-like, but her features sharpened, the mouth opening impossibly wide, filled with teeth that seemed to layer over one another, grinning far too much.

The light overhead flickered. Shadows stretched across the walls, flickering like frantic, clawed shapes.

I took a step back, my stomach knotting.

‚ÄúLeast you forget,‚Äù she repeated, her voice layered now‚Äîsomething sweet and sing-song undercut by something deeper, darker, ancient. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just here to play games. Not when there are other options.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move. Her glowing amber eyes bored into me like twin embers, unblinking, unrelenting.

Then, in an instant, she snapped back to normal.

The fox was small again, perched upright on her hind legs, ears twitching innocently. Her tails swished behind her in a smooth, carefree rhythm. Her grin returned‚Äîbright, cheerful, and almost irritatingly cute.

‚ÄúCall it a carrot-and-stick situation!‚Äù she chirped, the sing-song tone back in full force. ‚ÄúAnd right now, Glenn, I‚Äôm offering the carrot!‚Äù

I stared at her, my heart still pounding in my chest. I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd been holding my breath until I exhaled shakily.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I muttered, wiping a hand over my face. ‚ÄúOkay. Fine. I‚Äôll help you. But I need to get ready first. I can‚Äôt just disappear for God-knows-how-long‚ÄîI have a job. A life. I need to make arrangements.‚Äù

Kitsune tilted her head, watching me with amusement, like she found the idea of my normal responsibilities quaint. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. Do what you need to do.‚Äù

I exhaled slowly in relief. ‚ÄúGood. Just‚Ä¶ give me a few days.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree days,‚Äù she said immediately.

I looked at her sharply. ‚ÄúThree?‚Äù

Her grin widened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all the time you‚Äôre getting, Glenn. I‚Äôll be back in three days‚Äô time, and when I come, you‚Äôd better be ready.‚Äù

She turned, hopping off the counter in one fluid motion before striding toward the living room with that same, casual gait. She stopped at the threshold and glanced back at me.

‚ÄúOh, and Glenn?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said warily.

She smiled sweetly, amber eyes glowing faintly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep me waiting.‚Äù

Then, with a swish of her tails, she disappeared into the shadows of the house.

I stayed frozen in the kitchen for a long while, listening to the silence that followed. The light above me had stopped flickering, but the weight of the room felt heavier‚Äîlike it wasn‚Äôt entirely mine anymore.

1hg1f96,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1hg1f96/sitter_found_asleep/,Sitter found asleep,"TW: suicide

I had just typed out a whole post and my app glitched so here I am re-writing it, ugh. Anyways, I myself am not a nurse, but I‚Äôve been a lurker on this sub for a while since I used to work closely with nurses as an allied health professional. I know things are tough these days for you all, so want to start out by saying thank you for the hard, and often under-appreciated, work that you do. 

Now here is the situation I‚Äôm seeking advice on: a family member of mine was admitted to a hospital after a suicide attempt so they have a sitter. A different family member visited and during the visit, noticed that the sitter had fallen asleep. They took a picture but did not report it. They told me, and I think they should report it to the unit‚Äôs nursing management. Not necessarily to be punitive, but because that could be potentially a serious safety issue. 

Is there a better way to go about this? I wouldn‚Äôt want the sitter to lose their job, as I feel this probably speaks to the culture of the unit/hospital/healthcare system. The visiting family member spoke to a staff member (might have actually been the sitter) that said how understaffed they‚Äôve been. Believe me, I know hospitals are understaffed. But if a sitter is so tired (for whatever reason) that they are falling asleep in a suicidal patient‚Äôs room, I would hope they could ask for relief while they take a break/grab a coffee/just go home. 

Or maybe they were just so bored that they nodded off, who knows. Regardless of the why, this could be a potentially dangerous situation for the patient. 

Should my family member report this to the unit management with the hope of preventing this from happening again? 

ETA: this occurred during day shift, sometime between the hours of 8a-3:30p, if that helps with context

I work. Teams rings. Outlook pings. My keyboard taps and my mouse clicks. They message me. They call me. They all want something. They want something from me. Right now. I stop what I‚Äôm doing to give them what they want so many times that I forget what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. Between tasks, I scroll. I feel tension. I feel dread. I feel empty. But before I let myself feel, I scroll.

A funny joke. A cute animal. An unoriginal opinion shouted directly into a microphone. Violence unfolding in the streets of some distant country. Violence unfolding in streets that aren‚Äôt so far away. I need to stop scrolling. But I don‚Äôt want to feel. I switch apps. I repeat the process until I see something that might make me feel what I‚Äôve already been feeling.

I work. I bend every which way and make every which thing happen for *them.* I do as I‚Äôm told and then some. I do more to try and improve my job, to help someone else. Not enough. *They* watch me closely. *They* decide if I am allowed to keep the privilege of earning¬†a measly wage. I occupy a few cells on a spreadsheet. An ID number and a dollar amount. How do I convince them to keep me?

I finish work. I don‚Äôt feel accomplished. I don‚Äôt feel relieved. I feel empty. I feel nothingness. Not a peaceful emptiness. A pitch-black emptiness of lingering dread. Dread like the feeling of walking alongside a sheer cliff with no guard rail. Dread like the feeling of someone raising their hand to hit you and closing your eyes, just waiting for it to be over.

I try to relax. Try to watch something I like. Can‚Äôt relax. Can‚Äôt focus. The barrage of false urgency during the day has hamstrung my ability to just be. Can‚Äôt relax. Can‚Äôt focus.

I check. I check after a few minutes. No likes. I check again. No likes. I scroll. I check. I eat. I check again and I finally got a like. Maybe I do exist. Maybe I do matter. But it‚Äôs only one like. It may as well have been a mistaken double-tap on my picture.

I don‚Äôt leave the house. I scroll until the sun goes down. I scroll into the night. I crawl into bed and scroll some more. I finally put my phone down. I tell myself I need to sleep. I struggle to sleep. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

My dreams are work. My dreams are dread. I find myself in a realm where my mind can take me to any mountaintop and to any depth of the ocean, to the edges of the universe and to the deepest layers of the human experience.

The media said I was brilliant, a pioneer, a titan or the industry. I graced the covers of magazines with headlines that screamed, ‚ÄúVisionary CEO Disrupts Tech World,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Mind of a Modern Genius.‚Äù The cameras loved me, and the world drank up every polished word I delivered in interviews. My life was bulletproof, my empire sprawling.

It was easy to hide. Suits tailored to perfection, grins sharpened to charm boardrooms and TED Talk audiences. A steady hand when I held a microphone. But something about the applause always rang hollow in my ears, as though the sound was coming from somewhere far away.

The first crack in the fa√ßade appeared with Vivian. My wife. For ten years, she‚Äôd been the constant amid chaos. Viv was the calm in every hurricane‚Äîher laughter a balm, her gaze steady even when I fell into my darker moods. We‚Äôd met in college, a spilled coffee turning into love. She didn‚Äôt marry me for success or wealth. She loved me, the version of myself I barely recognized anymore.

Or at least, she had.

I noticed it on a Tuesday, a day so inconsequential it should have evaporated from my memory like smoke. She was slicing lemons in the kitchen, the knife moving rhythmically. I walked in, still clutching my briefcase, and froze.

Her hands weren‚Äôt right.

Vivian had delicate hands, hands that curved when she rested them on her cheek, hands that wrote letters in soft, sloping script. But these hands‚Äîher hands‚Äîwere slightly different. The fingers seemed longer, the skin paler, like they belonged to a wax model of her.

She looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúRough day?‚Äù she asked, as though nothing was wrong.

It was her voice, her face, her everything, but my gut turned. My mouth went dry. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said after a pause, setting my briefcase down carefully.

I forced myself to meet her eyes. Light hazel, same as always. But there was something behind them, something too smooth and placid, like the glass surface of a pond hiding something dark and writhing beneath.

‚ÄúYou look pale,‚Äù she said, stepping toward me. Her voice was honeyed, comforting. Luring.

I flinched before I could stop myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I said quickly.

Her smile lingered for just a moment too long before she turned back to the lemons, the knife continuing its steady rhythm. The scrape of metal on wood drilled into my skull like a heartbeat.

I chalked it up to exhaustion. That was logical, explainable. I was in the middle of developing the most ambitious AI platform of my career, one that had the board foaming at the mouth. Thirty-six-hour workdays were my norm. Sleep was a luxury, and sanity was a flexible concept.

But after that night, I couldn‚Äôt stop seeing it. The wrongness.

Her laughter came a beat too late, too rehearsed. When she tucked her long dark hair behind her ear, it was too perfect, like she‚Äôd practiced it in a mirror. The way she folded laundry‚Äîneat, mechanical‚Äîwasn‚Äôt how Vivian used to do it.

It was subtle, maddening in its smallness, but it was there.

The mirrors were next.

I had always been indifferent to mirrors‚Äîsaw them as tools, reflections of fact. But now, when I looked into one, the truth bent and twisted.

One night, I stood in my office, pacing in front of the tall window that overlooked the city. I caught my reflection in the glass and froze. My reflection wasn‚Äôt moving.

It stood there, still as a photograph, staring back at me. Its mouth began to curl into a smile. My mouth. Only it stretched too far, too wide, as though someone were pulling it from the corners.

I turned away, my breath hitching, and when I looked back, it was normal again. My reflection, hollow-eyed, a little disheveled.

That was when I stopped trusting the world around me.

I began studying Vivian‚Äîquietly, meticulously. I asked questions only she would know the answers to, but they were too simple, too obvious. She passed them all, but too well.

‚ÄúRemember Florence?‚Äù I said casually over dinner one night. ‚ÄúYou cried when we saw the Duomo.‚Äù

She smiled fondly. ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what did we fight about?‚Äù

The faintest flicker of hesitation crossed her face before she smoothed it over. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt fight, Jacob. It was perfect.‚Äù

But we had fought. I‚Äôd forgotten her birthday during that trip, too busy fielding calls from investors. She stormed off to a caf√© for hours while I panicked, thinking I‚Äôd lost her. That memory was burned into my brain, as sharp as a blade.

I stared at her across the table, my hands trembling beneath the wood. She just smiled, that placid, artificial smile, and sipped her wine.

I found the photographs a week later.

I had come home early‚Äîtoo early‚Äîand the house was quiet. I walked into her office to grab something and noticed the bottom drawer was slightly ajar.

Inside was a folder.

It was thick, heavy. I opened it and froze.

Photographs. Hundreds of them. All of me.

Me at work, talking to my assistant. Me pacing in my office. Me sleeping, my mouth slightly open on my pillow. Me brushing my teeth in the bathroom mirror.

They were taken at odd angles, through windows, cracks in doors.

At the bottom of the pile was a list of names. My name was at the top, circled in red.

I heard the front door creak open, and I shoved the folder back into the drawer. My pulse hammered as I stumbled back to the kitchen, forcing a smile.

‚ÄúJacob?‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home early.‚Äù

Her voice echoed through the hallway, but all I could hear was the blood roaring in my ears.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I lay next to her, staring at the ceiling, feeling her presence beside me like a storm cloud.

Around 3 a.m., she moved. Slowly, deliberately. I watched her silhouette rise and stand at the foot of the bed.

‚ÄúJacob,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you sleep anymore?‚Äù

My throat felt raw, my hands clammy.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real,‚Äù I whispered.

Her head tilted. Even in the dark, I could see the shadow of a smile stretch across her face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so tired, love. You‚Äôre seeing things.‚Äù

I bolted upright, my hand gripping the knife I kept under the pillow. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I hissed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your wife,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI always have been.‚Äù

I lunged, the knife flashing in the dark.

Her scream pierced the room, so raw, so real, it stopped me mid-motion. My hand shook as the light flicked on. Blood smeared my fingers, and Vivian lay crumpled on the carpet, her eyes wide, her lips quivering.

I saw it then‚Äîin the mirror across the room.

In the reflection, there was no knife. There was no blood. It was just me, kneeling on the floor, cradling her body like a child‚Äôs doll, rocking back and forth, whispering her name.

When they found me, I was alone in the room, staring into the mirror.

The doctors said I snapped. That Vivian had died months ago in a car accident that I caused. They said my mind broke under the weight of guilt, that I created imposters and monsters to protect myself.

But even now, as I sit in this stark white room, my wrists bound, I still see her in the reflections.

She smiles at me, tilts her head.

Shouldn't it be obvious to her that I like her?,"So, I met this girl at a summer job. It was an instant mutual connection. I developed romantic feelings on my end, however. And so, we've talked ever since. We've been good friends. I was worried at first, because after meeting up for coffee after the job, we spent 4 months without seeing each other. I tried my best to set things up without being like too pushy about it, until we were able to hang out finally in November. We saw a rom-com at a dine-in theater where she works. And then like 2 weeks later, we went to a park where she photographed me. 

Now, there is an issue. She's kind of taken. I know she was even engaged at one point but idk, who knows how serious it is. The problem with all this, is that she's never brought it up to me. She always mentions her family, her friend, her sisters but never the guy. For context, it is a long distance relationship at the moment and he has visited a couple times. The other thing is, i dont know if the guy knows about me just as how she doesnt mention him to me. 

A part of me hopes that she really likes my company because we do have similar goals, goals she might not share with anyone else. And so with her family visiting soon, I told her i didnt want her to worry about me and just focus on them. We met up yesterday and I gave her gifts for her upcoming bday and for christmas. And she loved them, they were really great, meaningful gifts. I got her a hat with her name on it, and a couple other things that mean a lot to her in regards to her passions. So we met up for coffee and she invited me to spend time with her shopping for some things. It was lovely, and I guess we'll see what happens. Cause also, i've talked to her about other hang outs as well and she's always down for it. 

Shouldn't it be obvious to her that I like her? I don't flirt but im very friendly, funny and nice. I look my best whenever we hang out. Maybe she's just being nice and good friend back to me? Maybe doesn't have the heart to turn me down? Or likes the attention from me?",0,1734404832.0,dating,8,0.33,False

Fifteen miles north of Indianapolis, Carmel stretches out‚Äîa suburb of spotless facades, where lawns are always perfect and time crawls like molasses. The clocktower at the center of town‚Äîresonant, precise‚Äîchimes every hour, a mechanical reminder of the beige lives unfolding beneath its shadow. Carmelite drones shuffle in and out of their homes, roundabouts spinning in endless loops like the gears of some corporate mind machine. Suburbia, perfected. White-collar monotony, minivans at the ready, PTA meetings with martinis on the side. The air smells of freshly mowed grass and sterile, unspoken desires.

Carmel was designed to be the antithesis of Gary. Gary, that other Indiana city. The one with the headlines‚Äîshootings, gang wars, fires licking at the rotting foundations of a place too far gone to fix. Carmel‚Äôs news is cleaner. A house fire, a dog caught in a tree. The kind of shit they can handle. Smooth, controlled. Every lawn neatly trimmed, every mailbox just so. Life in¬†

It started, like all things in this world, at the edges‚Äîon the periphery. A story that no one could believe, because they knew better than to believe. Better to laugh it off, to let it float away like smoke on a breeze. But it wouldn‚Äôt float. It hung heavy, thick, like the scent of impending doom.

August 2006. 9:17 PM.

Jamaal Thornton‚Äîlifetime Carmelite, native to the suburb, raised on the same streets, walking the same sidewalks‚Äîfirst saw the man. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be anything. A casual evening walk, routine. But that night, the air felt wrong, didn‚Äôt it? The air was thick, not just with the usual suburban scents, but with something else. The man was out there, somewhere.

Jamaal saw him just two blocks from home. A figure. Tall. Slender. Too confident. It wasn‚Äôt the outfit, no, but the movement. Something twisted. The knees were wrong, backward‚Äîunnatural he walked with an inverted bow-leg.

Military boots‚Äîclicking, clicking, clicking like some machine that had forgotten how to stop.¬†

Jamaal walked faster. The figure mirrored him. Always. A step behind, then a step ahead, then behind again. The clicking, a metronome, like a clock ticking down to something‚Äî

And then‚Äîthe sound. God, the sound. A snapping, rhythmic, like the pop of joints cracking. Whistling.¬†

Not just any whistling, no, but the whistling of someone lost in a dream. Not a song. The tune was that of a homunculus doo-opp group . The kind¬† that burrows into your skull, rattles around until you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs in your head or in the air.

Jamaal turned down his street. He didn‚Äôt look back‚Äîno, not at first. Not until he reached the driveway.

There. The figure. Standing still. Just standing. Like a statue. Silent now. The whistling gone. But the snap-snap-snap‚Äîthat rhythm, that tapping noise, louder now, closer now, slow, deliberate, as if the world itself had slowed down. Like time was stopping for him, or maybe he was stopping it.

Jamaal fumbled with his keys. His hands‚Äîoh, they were shaking. His heart, his chest‚Äîpounding. He turned. The man‚Äôs lips curled just so. Not a smile, no. A grimace. A smirk. Something darker. And the man‚Äîhe snapped again, slowly, rhythmically, as if counting down the seconds to his inevitable arrival.

Jamaal slammed the door, bolted it shut. Inside, he watched. Watched through the window, through the blinds, through the glass‚Äîhis mind cracking, splitting, unraveling as the figure stood there, unmoving, under the streetlamp‚Äôs sickly yellow glow. He could still hear it. The snap. Over and over, like a clock that never stops. Never stops.

And then, just like that, the figure turned. Walked away. Boots clicking. Fading. The rhythm dissolving into the night.

The Ball Gag Gargoyle has arrived

Forty minutes after the encounter, Jamaal sat in his third-story apartment, shaking like a leaf caught in a windstorm. The events of the night spun through his brain like a broken record, the snap, the whistle, over and over again, reverberating in the hollow, suffocating silence. He almost let himself believe it was done‚Äîmaybe it was just some twisted soul wandering the streets, the kind of creature that walked in the shadow of nightmares, but he could almost hear it. That laugh.

A low, guttural cackle, like a voice from the other side of reason.

Jamaal froze. It wasn‚Äôt coming from the street. No. The laugh‚Ä¶ it was up here. Higher. At the level of his windows, floating in the air like a phantom tongue licking the night sky. His heart hammered in his chest, thumping, drumming, a tattoo of fear. He edged closer to the window, hands trembling, fingers clutching at the curtains like they might hold him together.

Nothing. Just shadows. The trees swaying, the moonlight dripping down like cold sweat.

Then it hit him. The sound wasn‚Äôt below. It was *above.* *Above.*

His legs kicked into action before his mind could catch up, locking windows with the urgency of a man fleeing from a beast. Hands shaking, fumbling with latches, pulling blinds down like he could block out the world itself. By the time he reached his bedroom, the adrenaline surged, drowning out all reason. A pulse, an animal instinct thrumming through his veins.

He reached the last window. He went to lock it, but his eyes‚Äîhis *eyes*‚Äîdrifted outside.

What he saw could not be real. It couldn‚Äôt be.

A figure perched on the branch. A creature. Not human. Not anymore. Dressed in black leather so tight, it seemed to suck the life out of him, the suit reflecting the moonlight with an unnatural sheen. Wings. Wings that *should not have been there.* Huge, grotesque things stretching out from his back like they were made to tear the night itself apart. A ball gag‚Äîno, not just any ball gag‚Äîengraved with the words *RUB IT SLOW* in old Gothic script, shining like a curse. The man‚Äôs face was half-obscured, but his eyes‚ÄîGod, his eyes‚Äîblack holes pulling Jamaal in, sucking him down, down into some bottomless pit.

Jamaal‚Äôs breath hitched in his throat. He stumbled backward, a gasp escaping him, the curtains yanked shut in a panic. But it was too late. Curiosity, that bastard, clawed at him. He peeked again.

Nothing. The branch was empty. Vanished.

His heart jackhammered, and before he could think, he was grabbing his phone, dialing the police. Carmel‚Äôs finest‚Äîlaughable, if you asked anyone who didn‚Äôt look like him. Minorities? They don‚Äôt get responses. Jamaal knew the game. He knew the score. Crimes like his weren‚Äôt worth investigating. Not when your skin was the wrong shade.

Still, he told them everything. The man‚Äôs movements, the whistling, the snapping, the way their eyes had met, locked. It was all there, every detail. The officers were polite, all right, and respectful‚Äîon the surface. But beneath it, the skepticism crawled like a cold snake through the air. The one officer‚Äîyoung, smooth-faced‚Äîsmirked at the mention of the ball gag engraving.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep an eye out,‚Äù they said, their voices just loud enough to drown out the doubt dripping through their teeth. A surveillance patrol, they assured him. But Jamaal could see it in their eyes.

They weren‚Äôt listening. Not really.

Hours later, as the night thickened like tar around him, the cackling returned. Louder. Deeper. More guttural. It wasn‚Äôt a sound from this world. No. It was the sound of something old, something savage, playing with its prey.

Jamaal clutched his blanket, his body rigid, his mind on the edge of snapping. He tried to block it out, to push it away like a bad memory, but the laugh kept growing louder, crawling through the walls, a sound that scraped at the very bones of the night. He couldn't move. Couldn‚Äôt scream. It was getting closer.

Jamaal, shaking like a cornered animal, gathered whatever scraps of courage he had left. He moved toward the window, fingers clawing at the blinds. With a violent yank, they tore open.

And there he was.

The gimp.

Perched on a branch so impossibly thin it should have snapped under the weight of logic. Inches from the glass, like some grotesque mockery of nature, he sat there, his wings stretching wide in the dim moonlight, casting long, unnatural shadows that crawled across the walls like they had a mind of their own. But something new. Something worse. The man‚Äîif he could be called that‚Äîhad exposed himself. His genitals hung in the open, grotesquely displayed against the gleam of his leather suit, like a sick joke.

Jamaal‚Äôs eyes locked with the creature‚Äôs. Those eyes. A color no man should ever see. Ice-blue, glowing with that strange, hollow detachment, like the whole scene was beneath him.

A wave of nausea twisted in Jamaal‚Äôs gut. He wanted to scream, to tear his mind away from the horror, but it came out‚Äîa guttural sound, a wail, like a banshee caught in the throat. He scrambled for his phone, fingers slipping over the buttons, dialed 911 in a frenzy of panic.

The line connected, but the gimp‚Ä¶ The gimp tilted his head. Just so. A mockery. Then he waved, slow and deliberate, a gesture more fitting for a dying puppet than a man.

The gimp moved like something from a nightmare. A ballet dancer, maybe, if that ballet had been twisted out of shape, limbs stretching like rubber, unnatural, grotesque. With a graceful, haunting fluidity, he climbed down the tree, disappearing into the dark like smoke in the wind.

The cops came. Again. A repeat of the script. Jamaal, wild-eyed and desperate, described the gimp‚Äôs sickening, deliberate motions. His detailed account only fed their skepticism, fed their disbelief. ‚ÄúUnsubstantiated,‚Äù they wrote. Another name, another file, another dead lead. Surveillance patrols? Half-hearted, at best.

A month later, Jamaal was dead. The coroner‚Äôs verdict? Suicide. But the rumors spread through the cracked windows of Carmel, whispering through the backyards and HOA meetings. Some said it was the gimp. That his shadow had reached into Jamaal‚Äôs mind and twisted it until there was no escape. Others said there was something darker at play, a murder dressed up as tragedy.

No evidence. No clues. Nothing to tie it to the *thing* that haunted him. But those few who had listened‚Äîthose few who had believed‚Äîknew. They knew the truth, as sure as the sun rises and sets.

The Ball Gag Gargoyle wasn‚Äôt finished.

**Sightings**

Doug Frawley was a man of routine. He had one constant in his life: the smell of stale coffee and the rhythmic scrape of his mop against cold linoleum. It was simple work, solitary work. Doug had been the overnight janitor at the AT&T building in downtown Indianapolis for years, the kind of gig that kept you on the fringe of everything, a shadow in a concrete maze. He didn‚Äôt mind. People, after all, were a hassle. It was the quiet that kept him sane, the gentle drone of the fluorescent lights above, the hum of the air conditioning kicking in every once in a while. It was just him, the building, and the endless expanse of glass windows that reflected back the city's sickly glow.

But that night, something happened. Something that didn‚Äôt belong in the rhythm of his world.

It was a sticky, humid evening, the kind that made the air feel thick, oppressive, almost alive, pushing down on you. Doug was cleaning the glass windows on the 38th floor‚Äîhigh enough to feel above the city, but not enough to escape it. As he reached for the squeegee, wiping away the smear of the last storm, something caught his eye. A silhouette. It was perched on a rooftop, perched against the glow of the skyline like some grotesque monument to a lost god. A gargoyle, he thought, squinting through the glass. A piece of modern art, maybe‚Äîsome eccentric millionaire's latest indulgence. It wasn‚Äôt unheard of. But this was Indianapolis, not New York or Los Angeles. ""Maybe someone just had a wild idea,"" Doug muttered to himself, trying to dismiss the strangeness as easily as he dismissed the hum of the fluorescent lights above.

But then the figure moved.

At first, it was a twitch‚Äîa slight shift that could have been a trick of the light, the wind, or Doug‚Äôs sleep-deprived mind. But it wasn‚Äôt a trick. The figure sprang into motion. It didn‚Äôt just sway like a statue in the wind‚Äîit *pranced*. Massive wings, black and leathery, unfolded with a noise that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. They flared open, jagged, bat-like, catching the glint of streetlight as they beat the air with a sickeningly precise rhythm. The thing‚Äîif you could call it that‚Äîmoved like a deranged ballerina, graceful in a way that made the hairs on Doug‚Äôs neck stand up. He blinked hard, rubbed his eyes. He‚Äôd been working the overnight shift for six years straight. Maybe the exhaustion was getting to him, twisting the world into something he couldn‚Äôt trust. His hand gripped the squeegee, knuckles turning white. Surely, this was a hallucination. No one could move like that.

But the thing didn‚Äôt care about Doug‚Äôs fragile sense of reality. It leapt, twirled, its leather-clad body gleaming under the lights, too surreal, too *wrong*. The wings‚Äîspiky, angular, and *pointless*‚Äîfluttered, as if it were testing the air, preparing for takeoff. It was too fluid, too precise. A dancer, yes, but a dancer with an agenda‚Äîa twisted purpose that Doug couldn't fathom. Each movement carried a weight, a rhythm that made the air around it feel like it was breathing, alive, suffocating. It wasn‚Äôt just some eccentric artist‚Äôs creation. No, this was something else entirely.

Doug stood frozen. His world had splintered for a moment, cracked down the middle, and this‚Äîthis *thing*‚Äîwas standing on the other side of the break, laughing. He squeezed his eyes shut, praying it was the exhaustion. But when he opened them again, the figure was still there, still dancing, still moving in that *unholy* ballet.

He backed away, the squeegee slipping from his hand and clattering to the floor. He couldn‚Äôt breathe. The room felt too small. The walls closed in. The lights flickered above. He turned, eyes darting back to the glass. It was gone.

Just like that, it had vanished into the humid night.

Doug didn‚Äôt know what he saw. Hell, he didn‚Äôt even know if he *believed* what he saw. But the feeling‚Äîthat gnawing, acidic feeling that something *was wrong*‚Äîlingered in his bones long after the shift was over. He never spoke of it. He never told anyone. People would say it was stress. It was always the stress. But stress doesn‚Äôt make you see *that*. And Doug wasn‚Äôt the only one.

No.

For a brief, terrifying moment, Doug was sure the figure locked eyes with him through the window. His stomach lurched, and a cold sweat broke out across his skin. It was a ridiculous thought‚Äîhow could anyone on a rooftop dozens of feet away possibly see him? But there was no mistaking it: the figure halted mid-prance, its head tilting slowly, as if it had just become aware of Doug‚Äôs presence. Then, with chilling deliberation, it raised a gloved hand in a slow, taunting wave.

Doug‚Äôs blood ran cold.

His instincts screamed at him to look away, to turn and flee, but his body refused to obey. He was rooted to the spot, trapped between fear and disbelief. He watched as the creature resumed its bizarre display, moving with unnerving grace and confidence. It strutted along the edge of the rooftop like a performer, an exaggerated villain surveying its kingdom. At one point, it even struck a pose, one hand on its hip, the other outstretched toward the downtown skyline. Its fingers pointed dramatically as if commanding the financial heart of Indianapolis to bend to its will.

Doug‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. His mind tried to reject the absurdity of it all‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt real, it couldn‚Äôt be. It was just exhaustion, just too many sleepless nights in a building full of ghosts and echoing silence. But the evidence was right there, mocking him from across the glass.

With a tremble, Doug stumbled away from the window. His body was on autopilot, hands scrambling for something to steady himself, but his mind was already splintering, grappling with a horrifying truth he wasn‚Äôt ready to face. He muttered to himself, trying to will the sight away. ""Gotta lay off the energy drinks,"" he whispered, as though the caffeine could explain away what he‚Äôd seen.

But deep down, Doug knew. He *knew* it wasn‚Äôt a figment of his imagination. No, what he saw was real. Too real. And there was nothing he could do about it.

Doug never came forward. He kept his sighting to himself, rationalizing it as exhaustion-induced hallucinations‚Äîthe kind that haunt the lonely corridors of a skyscraper in the dead of night. He was alone, after all, and what did he have to prove? A janitor had no business questioning reality when it slipped through the cracks.

But the sightings didn‚Äôt end there.

Others started talking.

A woman named Carla Henderson, an assistant manager at a nearby caf√©, was the next to report an encounter. It wasn‚Äôt far from Doug‚Äôs vantage point‚Äîher apartment window overlooked the same stretch of rooftops where the gargoyle had been prancing. She hadn‚Äôt seen much at first, just the flicker of a shadow against the skyline. But then, late one evening, she saw it in full: the leather-clad figure, with wings that seemed to ripple like broken wings of a bat, dark and jagged against the lights of the city. It had the same haunting poise, the same absurd theatrics, but Carla was struck by something else‚Äîsomething far more chilling.

The creature wasn‚Äôt alone.

Standing next to it, as if in some twisted communion, was another figure‚Äîtaller, leaner, but equally grotesque, wearing a black mask that obscured its face. This figure didn‚Äôt move with the same fluid grace as the winged one; instead, it stood perfectly still, watching, waiting. Carla couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that the masked figure was *aware* of her. It didn‚Äôt perform for the audience, but it knew someone was watching.

Carla‚Äôs hands trembled as she reported it. Her co-workers dismissed her story‚Äîtoo many late nights, too many double shifts‚Äîbut the unease lingered. Was she the only one seeing this thing? Or were others, too, beginning to question what they thought they knew about their own city?

each account more absurd, more horrifying than the last. Some said they saw the creature perched atop a building, staring down at them with cold, unblinking eyes. Others claimed to have heard its wings flapping in the dead of night, as if it were circling the city, waiting for something, or someone.

And then there were the whispers‚Äîthe ones that made you second-guess your own sanity. People claimed to have seen the creature in the middle of the day, strolling through parks or standing outside of local businesses, just out of sight, hidden in plain view. The stories blended together, interwoven with rumors of strange symbols carved into buildings and chilling graffiti painted on alley walls‚Äîsickeningly familiar symbols, ones that seemed to crawl out from the deepest, forgotten corners of the world.



The Ball Gag Gargoyle had been watching‚Äîand it was ready to make its move.



**Pine Cones and the Ritual**

It started innocuously enough, as these things often do‚Äîa ripple in the fabric of normalcy, too subtle for anyone to notice until it was already unraveling. Around two o‚Äôclock, while the men argued over charcoal versus propane and the kids filled the air with shrieks of sugar-fueled chaos, a strange man appeared at the edge of the cul-de-sac.

He was walking funny. Bent knees, stiff arms, snapping his fingers like a metronome wound too tight. Snap. Step. Snap. Step. His head bobbed with the rhythm, a grotesque parody of a man trying to catch a beat that only he could hear. He didn‚Äôt look at anyone directly, but his eyes darted‚Äîfast, birdlike‚Äîscanning the yards and driveways with a predatory curiosity.

‚ÄúWho the hell is that?‚Äù someone asked, voice low, as if saying it too loud might invite the man closer.

‚ÄúNeighborhood weirdo,‚Äù Frank muttered, flipping a burger with too much force. ‚ÄúEvery street‚Äôs got one.‚Äù

But Tommy Dellarocco knew better. Something about the man was wrong, and not just wrong in the way people get when they‚Äôre cracked by life. This was *wrong-wrong*, the kind that itches at the base of your skull, whispering that you‚Äôre standing too close to the edge.

The man snapped his fingers one last time, spun in a jerky half-circle, and shuffled off toward the woods at the edge of the park. The party moved on, the strange figure filed away under Things to Joke About Later, after a few more beers had taken the edge off.

By evening, he was all but forgotten. The beer had flowed freely, drowning the strange vision in a haze of small talk and potato salad. But Tony Dellarocco couldn‚Äôt shake the image. Something about the figure‚Äôs gait had wormed its way into her brain, a greasy smear on the fabric of her thoughts.

She wandered to the edge of the yard, the noise of the barbecue fading behind her. A pine tree loomed over her like an old god, its branches heavy with sap and shadow. She leaned against the rough bark, savoring the quiet, the faint scent of resin and earth.

And then the pine cone hit her.

It wasn‚Äôt a gentle fall. It smacked her square on the head, a sharp, humiliating thunk that echoed through her skull. She looked up, her hand pressed to the sore spot, ready to curse the tree for its betrayal.

That‚Äôs when she saw him.

The Gargoyle.

He was crouched in the branches, his body coiled like a spring, his leather skin gleaming in the last light of the day. His wings stretched out behind him, glistening with something wet and viscous that dripped onto the pine needles below. His head tilted, the ball gag in his mouth gleaming like a sick joke.

Tony froze. Her breath hitched in her throat, her mind racing in a hundred directions but landing nowhere. She wanted to scream, to run, but her body refused to obey.

The Gargoyle moved with slow, deliberate grace his eyes blue and soft with a murderous boredom,

With one hand he ripped another pine cone from the tree and bagn cradling it like a sacred object, and began to rub it against his chest in slow, sensual circles. The leather squeaked faintly, the sound grotesque in the stillness.

It wasn‚Äôt random. There was a rhythm to it, a ritual. The Gargoyle‚Äôs movements were hypnotic, his body swaying like a snake charmed by its own music. He rubbed the pine cone faster, then slower, then faster again, his head lolling to one side as if caught in some ecstatic trance.

Mystified by the pine cone ritual, tony failed to notice until it was almost too late the gargoyle had his gentals exposed.

And then, with a guttural moan muffled by the gag, he launched himself into the air.

Tony watched, paralyzed, as he flew through the trees‚Äînot with the elegance of a bird, but with the wild, chaotic energy of a monkey swinging from branch to branch. His wings flapped in spasmodic bursts, propelling him forward in unpredictable arcs. He didn‚Äôt fly so much as ricochet, his body a black blur against the orange-pink sky.

The sound of snapping branches and creaking wood filled the air as he disappeared into the canopy, leaving behind only the faint smell of leather and something rancid.

Tony stood under the tree, her heart hammering in her chest, the pine cone still lying at her feet. She stared at it, half expecting it to start moving, to sprout legs and scuttle away.

The party behind her was still going, the laughter and music a cruel contrast to the surreal nightmare she had just witnessed. She took a shaky step back, then another, her eyes never leaving the tree.

By the time she rejoined the group, she wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôd imagined the whole thing. But the grease stain on her shirt‚Äîwhere the pine cone had briefly brushed against her‚Äîtold her otherwise.

We were only dating and never had the exclusive conversation but we saw each other constantly.

Long story short he acted very strongly, which I liked. He came to my neighbourhood when we didn‚Äôt live that close together, he showed me his childhood home, even told me he spoke to his mom about me etc. I met his friends but he hadn‚Äôt met mine yet. 

About a month and a half in, he tells me that his work is sending him abroad permanently and that he can‚Äôt do long distance. I got really upset by the situation because he wasn‚Äôt offering me any choice but to accept it was over, and I told him once it‚Äôs done I don‚Äôt open the door again.

**Story so Far:**

* *Peanut officially joins the Starchasers*
* *Forgemaster Bvalinn agrees to make bullets and pellets for the team and will be discrete about it.*
* *Alchemist Knarru agrees to be the supplier for gunpowder and other related chemicals for the team.*

**\_\_\_**

**Autumnhollow, front lawn:**

‚ÄúBaseplate, what‚Äôs the SitRep? Over.‚Äù Ingrid asked over the radio.

‚Äú*Starchaser, we're still Oscar-Mike to the hospital. Over.*‚Äù Zefir replied. He and the mice had left before Gwen, Peanut, and Sammy had driven their wagon out to the streets to do their shopping.

*‚ÄúOscar-Mike?‚Äù* Siria asked. She, Kinu, and Kvaris, and Viel had finished their business at Jordi‚Äôs Dismantling shop and were making their way to the market to rendezvous with Gwen and Co.

‚ÄúOscar-Mike is shorthand for ‚Äòon the move‚Äô, one of the many military jargons for fast communication over the radio.‚Äù Philia replied, waving to Amalla and Kaolla who were also on their way to the market. The two wolian girls waved back, looking satisfied after seeing how well Ingrid could fight.

Philia then resumed tightening the screws. Ingrid had taken a hit during her sparring session, earning the wolian girls the right to observe the team‚Äôs adventures. Philia decided to have the monitor mounted to one of the stout wooden struts.

With one last twist, Philia tried jiggling the bracket and found it was solid. Cecil took the big flat screen monitor out of it‚Äôs box. Together with Philia they secured the monitor onto the bracket, both were satisfied at how solid the arm was.

‚ÄúStill‚Ä¶‚Äù Cecil added, chortling as he did ‚Äú...he finally said the thing! He got to say that Call of Duty line!‚Äù

‚ÄúZef‚Äôs on a roll today.‚Äù Ingrid giggled, she had just finished drilling a hole through the wall of the house. In a few minutes, she ran a flexible steel electrical conduit through the hole, this would serve as a protective tunnel for the electrical and ethernet cable that connected the gazebo TV to the house. She then pushed the conduit through PVC pipes, which were already buried into the ground.

Although Cecil was imprisoned inside his arcane dimension he was still able to extend a tendril and grab the cable halfway through. Ingrid waited until Cecil had secured the conduit staples before doing the same on the house‚Äôs wall. Then, she began caulking the hole in the wall.

The three of them picked up their coffees in sync and downed it, before Ingrid spoke up and said.

‚ÄúGimme a feed, Neith!‚Äù

¬†

Watching them were Mink and Roofe, who had just come in for coffee. They were joined by Farlan, Kirtus, and Cataline who had also come over to provide their reports of the village to Philia. The four of them watched in fascination as the three otherworlders worked quickly and efficiently over some unknown project. Ingrid, Philia and Cecil answered all their questions without any of the usual technical jargon.

‚ÄúInformation as you know is a powerful weapon.‚Äù Ingrid had told Kirtus when she was digging up the small trench that the PVC pipe would go into. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all welcome to come and watch but‚Ä¶ well you know how it is in a dungeon‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a pretty sight at times.‚Äù

There was a faraway look in Ingrid‚Äôs eyes as her mind as all minds do, brought up unwanted memories. This time of the sight of the butchered and gutted tixi mice, heartlessly hanging over the cages of the still-living ones being kept for food.

‚ÄúThank the wolian girls for managing to score a hit against Ingrid.‚Äù Philia giggled as she carried the big TV, still in its box and laid it on the gazebo.

¬†

For some strange reason however, when they had asked Neith to activate the TV. The three of them groaned and moaned in pain and agony as if struck by some extremely malevolent curse, but they quickly laughed, as if accepting they were the victim of a very funny prank pulled on them. Energetic, catchy music began playing while the ‚ÄúTee-Vee‚Äù showed a man with light brown hair and a striped tunic singing and dancing.

\_\_\_

**Meanwhile, on the streets of Teth-Odin:**

Zefir and the mice had yet to see the hospital where Iohann had taken the rescued mice to, but the fluffy sheep cleric had already gotten an idea of how Neith was able to tap into their Tac-Cams and Earpieces and told the sentient AI to track her location.

With that, Neith was able to work out the coordinates of the hospital. Using a combination of Iohann‚Äôs headset feed, tracker, and a scan of the map; it didn‚Äôt take long and Philia‚Äôs pride and joy was able to zero in on a good estimate of the hospital‚Äôs location and provide directions to Zefir and the mice.

¬†

As the team spoke over the radio, Zefir and his party made their way to the hospital along the main streets of Teth-Odin. The streets were wide and clean, the buildings quite tall. A row of gaily festooned poles held up faerie lights, which were carved into perfect spheres. These street lights stood at regular intervals, a metal dome was perfected atop the light-bearing crystal like an umbrella. When darkness fell, the highly-reflective interior of the dome enhanced the faerie lights‚Äô luminosity, keeping the streets bright and cheerful in the city that never sleeps.

Merchant stalls spanned the whole length of every street block, one side facing the avenue of buildings, one side facing the middle of the street. It was broken up into regular intervals to allow foot traffic to cross from the outer lanes and inner lanes and vice versa. Zefir and the mice walked along the lane where the merchant stalls faced the central lane, further to his left was the center where pedestrial traffic merged with hooves and wagons.

On that lane a wagon on the road bearing the banner of Teth-Odin came to a stop, and a tamer with a tabard of the City Guard hopped out of the back, waving his hands rhythmically as slimes and jellies bounced out of the wagon and energetically began rolling along the streets, picking up garbage and dirt. Meanwhile street sweepers with brooms busily kept the streets clean as well, when they saw the slimes and jellies they piled up their gathered detritus so the creatures could pick them up.

Seeing them reminded Zefir why Cecil himself was an oddity; it wasn‚Äôt just because he talked and had that flying portal. Cecil didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúcore‚Äù, a perfectly round sphere that was like the central organ of the slime. Cecil looked powerful as he lacked that one weakness and the only genus of slime that also lacked a core was of all things, an Elder Slime. Cecil also had a face, though Zefir had seen enough footage in the news to know that Cecil‚Äôs ‚Äúeyes‚Äù and mouth were just as easily regenerated as any other part of him. ‚ÄúRipping‚Äù Cecil‚Äôs eyes off was as ineffectual as holding one‚Äôs hand out to someone‚Äôs face for a few seconds to obscure their vision.

A big cube jelly the size of a cargo crate and a beach ball-sized core slid along the street, as it passed by a butcher‚Äôs stall, the lion-folk owner tossed the scraps over, patting the big jelly which seemed to respond to him by pumping itself up and down before continuing on.

¬†

While Ingrid‚Äôs slime friend wasn‚Äôt with him, Zefir still was gathering looks his way. The idea of tixi mice as familiars was unheard of. He had seen a few of them during his first year in Terragalia and he first thought of them as the helpful, friendly version of a raccoon with the clout of a capybara or an adorable fluffy dog. He had seen them help in farms and they were given food and shelter in return before the mice eventually decided to move on. Now that he thought of them, he figured that Saber probably decided to head to New Gorpisal to make themselves useful in exchange for treats and that was how they met Ingrid.

¬†

He didn‚Äôt know it as she had yet to tell the story, but the mice had followed the monster stampede of New Gorpisal, keeping their distance so they wouldn‚Äôt be made targets. When Ingrid showed up, the mice cutely waddled over to her, squeaking in a friendly way that melted her heart. The Starchaser quickly started making cute noises as she happily embraced them, and the rest was history.

¬†

Now there were fifteen of them, all decked out in lamellar armor and pointed helmets that made Zefir think what Genghis‚Äô Khan‚Äôs elite crack squad would wear; sturdy and impressive-looking to let everyone know their boss had power. Dain (and later Bvalinn) made armor for the mice worthy of a Kingsguard. Strapped tight to one shoulder and held steady by that strap in one paw were their rifles. Nobody knew what they were but anyone with common sense could tell that the mice were armed, probably with some good but oddly-shaped staves. For the 189, it was their SCAR-H and M-14‚Äôs, for the Iroquois mice it was their AK‚Äôs.

Zefir himself was armed. For show he had his short sword hanging from his belt. A pistol was holstered under his open gambeson jacket and left armpit, another was holstered to the right side of his belt. Both of which were hidden from view. A FN P-90 submachine gun hung across his left shoulder and swung on his right side. To everyone else however, they only noticed the short sword‚Äôs scabbard dangling from his jacket, his main gun mistaken for some purse or maybe a potion pack. People walking around bearing arms attracted no undue attention, and so the mice at the perimeter of the group had their glaives out. Those on the left flank held their glaives on that side while the mice at the right side held their rifle straps with their left paw across their chest while their right bore the polearm, all of them courteously wrapped in cloth to avoid poking anyone‚Äôs eye out. It was like a cage had formed around Zefir‚Äôs sides and back as these mice rested their glaives over their right shoulder. Meanwhile the mice marching ahead of him held no glaives, keeping their rifles to their chest, Arthur stood between Zefir and the mice marching ahead, his snout buried on his smartphone as he observed the camera from Neith‚Äôs Aquila drone which observed the party from above, discreetly staying out of sight by staying close to the roofs.

¬†

Teth-Odin was definitely rolling in money due to the dungeon they had built underneath. It showed in the big busy main avenue he and the mice were currently walking through; the wide avenue was flanked by colorful buildings three to five stories high and not a single roof with dull faded paint, not a single wall with cracked plaster showing the rotting, dirty bricks exposed to the air. No, the roofs were all looking like they were repainted every few months or so, every wall looked like it was replastered or re-tiled.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs turn right, guys.‚Äù Zefir said as one very busy stall was being swamped by eager customers enjoying a kebab on skewers. Arthur squeaked in assent and the group slipped through a break in the line of stalls. They walked by a team of trolls humming along as they performed maintenance on the street-facing wall of one bakery, looking jollier than ever as the sun shined on them. Trolls in Terragaia were tall individuals, rather than turn to stone under sunlight, it invigorated more than a few of their sub-species while others it served as their caffeine or stimulant. All-in-all, every troll had to watch how much sunshine they were getting. A small smile curved Zefir‚Äôs lips as he suddenly had the mental image of a bunch of guys with a trowel in one hand and a bottle of booze in another. Most trolls were usually up and about during the night and until noon-time. Any troll seen at high noon was this world‚Äôs equivalent of some guy working the night shift. It was different however, for trolls who worked underground or mostly indoors, these folks followed the same hours as most other people.

¬†

At least the first two stories of every building in the avenue were clearly marked on the outside as commercial establishments; boasting grand signs, colorful banners, and many had overhanging balconies accessible from an outer staircase. Several extended their commercial space all the way to the third floor while the rest were either lodgings rented out or the homes of the business owners themselves.

He passed by a restaurant on a street corner. Two sides were made of gigantic brick walls, thought it was probably just a veneer, but the other two sides that faced the streets had no walls, only strong, thick pillars of harder-than-steel lumber held up the four floors above, a combination of Terragalian architectural technology and the existence of lumber far beyond that of Earth‚Äôs. He saw minotaurs, jodoves, and felmoons along with lizard-like sorians, nobody batting an eye as smoked carcasses of goats, sheep, and pigs hung on the wall. To him it was still puzzling to see, even though he had eventually come to the conclusion that a cow to a minotaur, an alligator to a sorian, and sheep to a felmoon was as removed to them as a monkey was to a human. He had once heard from Philia that in Arek‚Äôs homeworld, their equivalent of a Rickroll was a dancing gulan shrimp man grilling big shrimps while singing a catchy song, and in his planet, the space shrimp people saw them like pork.

Not that Zefir, or by his previous life as Dick Wood, would he ever consider eating a monkey, and while he was grateful he‚Äôs never seen a cat on the wrong side of the butcher shop, he had learned that a few of the meat he‚Äôs had came from this world‚Äôs equivalent of a big cat like a lion or tiger. A Var-Tiger to be exact, a huge thirty-foot super predator that needed to be regularly pruned from the wildlife census before they end up upsetting the local ecology. If he were to believe the stories; they were once the escaped pets of some aristocrat trying to look cool in front of his peers. He wondered if Ingrid would try to tame the first one she saw.

¬†

They passed through yet another intersection without needing to halt their pace. How the City Guards of any city manage to keep things flowing smoothly was a mystery to him, and he was grateful that not once did he and the mice ever have to stop and wait on account of some traffic jam or a deluge of wheels and hooves hurrying by until some Isekai cop blew their whistle for the perpendicular traffic‚Äôs turn to simulate a stampede.

As they walked by some of the vendors, they recognized Zefir on account of him coming along with the Enthana sisters days prior and waved at them. Zefir and the mice waved back.

Some of them jokingly asked if he had slept in.

‚ÄúY-yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Zefir said, pretending to look shame-faced, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs alright, because my job is to tend to their lodgings.‚Äù

‚ÄúOooooh‚Ä¶‚Äù said one minotaur lady selling fruits, her bovine rumble comforting, ‚Äúso that‚Äôs what you kids call it nowadays‚Ä¶‚Äù she smiled as Zefir picked the best-looking pears and oranges he could find. He wasn‚Äôt sure what the mice in the dungeons‚Äô diet was, so his other concern besides dealing with malnutrition was scurvy.

‚ÄúCall what? Oh!‚Äù Zefir asked, but then realized she was insinuating that his role for that party of all girls was feeding both of their mouths.

He smiled and puffed his chest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an obligation!‚Äù

The minotaur laughed and gave him a discount.

\_\_\_

**Meanwhile, at the Teth-Odin Grand Market:**

Kinu, Kvaris, Siria, and Viel had finished their business at Jordi‚Äôs dismantling shop, having settled for a good amount that would allow the party to rest and eat well for a week while doing nothing.

Upon hearing the figure, Ingrid addressed everyone on the radio.

‚ÄúDoes everyone find this acceptable?‚Äù Ingrid asked. ‚ÄúIohann said there‚Äôs eighteen mice, and they all look enthused to join us. It will take a while to arm and equip all of them. While it looks like King Fish had made a lot of guns, they will need to be appropriately modified and trained.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good investment.‚Äù Kvaris said, ‚ÄúWe can write to the guild regarding our paused activity.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done something exceptional.‚Äù Siria said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve wiped out a whole nest and rescued many, a week shouldn‚Äôt hurt, and considering how more mice with guns would definitely help our fighting strength, I‚Äôm sure that guildmaster Tibbles will understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúPffft!‚Äù Ingrid was in the middle of drinking and was now coughing up from the coffee that came out of her nose ‚ÄúA-anyway, I hope it won‚Äôt come to waiting a week but I will prioritize King Fish‚Äôs well-being.‚Äù

‚ÄúKitty-Five and I can help with the enchanting work, it‚Äôs exhausting sure, but a fun and interesting process.‚Äù Siria said.

‚ÄúAgreed!‚Äù Viel piped up.

‚ÄúI can give it a shot.‚Äù Zefir volunteered ‚ÄúMy hobby back in Ontala village also involved enchanting things, I‚Äôm no expert sure, but I see there‚Äôll be parts that are easy to work this, I can handle those‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAs do I‚Ä¶‚Äù Selphie added ‚ÄúKing Fish uses mana-treated treantwood, that would definitely fall into my domain.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks everyone.‚Äù Philia said, ‚ÄúBut Starchaser‚Äôs right, let‚Äôs not hurry this process, it‚Äôs not about the speed, let‚Äôs do this accurately and safely. Alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn that case‚Ä¶‚Äù Ingrid said, everyone could hear the sound of her boots clomping onto the wooden floor of the gazebo and the coos of the larkirk doves. ‚ÄúI will personally write a message to the guild letting them know we‚Äôre taking a couple of days off to upgrade our equipment.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs settled then,‚Äù Kvaris said ‚ÄúWe take the day off, prepare ourselves for a deeper plunge into the dungeon when we return.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeaking of which, where are you headed off to now?‚Äù Ingrid asked as she began writing.

‚ÄúChapelle‚Äôs, an old war buddy of my old man. He‚Äôs got a shop here.‚Äù Kvaris said ‚ÄúBvalinn‚Äôs already swamped with our orders for bullets pellets, and according to King Fish, more mice armor, glaives, and knives. Seeing as there‚Äôs shadow mice, I‚Äôll see if I can find some weapons they can use to fight up close and personal...‚Äù

¬†

At the market, Gwen, Peanut, Sammy, Amalla and Kaolla, met up with the quartet from the dismantling house. The wolian girls had completed their sparring with Ingrid and were thoroughly impressed at her strength and skill. Now finished, they had hurried over to relieve Sammy after Kvaris said she wanted to bring her along to a family friend who dealt in weapons and armor. Philia had considered making an order for the mice‚Äôs brooches but decided that until Ingrid had come up with the names there was no sense making an order yet. As such, it made sense to have another smithy deal with the girls‚Äô armor, and considering this was a good family friend to the Enthanas, Ingrid agreed for them to have their weapons and armor serviced there.

Chappelle‚Äôs Arms Emporium was a cozy-looking store occupying a corner. It was more of a high-end boutique, with many of the wares enchanted and all of them at the very least made to impress. The proprietor himself was at the counter, a scarred, one-eyed crocodile-folk who made a pleased guttural sound as he saw the pups of his dear wartime buddy all grown up and friends with what could only be the banner-rider of an orc tribe. After a perfunctory greeting and catching up, Chapelle made a genteel crocodilian rumble in this throat thoughtfully as Kvaris mentioned shadow mice.

‚ÄúAmaduscia and I have seen such mice during our youth.‚Äù Chapelle told them. They all sat inside his office, enjoying the tea his secretary, who frequently had to deal with orders by letter had prepared ‚Äúfrom what we‚Äôve seen I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not too strenuous but the cost of teleporting does have its limits and can exhaust the mice. I would recommend one such mouse to hang back and maybe use a crossbow and fight at a distance.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe currently have four mice that engage the enemy with glaives, appropriately shortened for the mice of course.‚Äù Kvaris told him. ‚Äúbut still long enough to let them fight from a safe distance. Our leader is currently considering the idea of having the shadow mice fight alongside these glaive-wielding mice.‚Äù

The crocodile thought for a while.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre interested I can, for a price, make pike-cleavers for these mice. I‚Äôll even give you wands of duality on a discount and a free dagger to make it easy to stow away..‚Äù

‚ÄúPike-cleavers?‚Äù Kinu said. ‚ÄúYou mean those really long greatswords you and father used in the battle of Lanfar pass?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot the exact swords no, but one scaled down for the mice to use. Even then, it will still give them excellent range, just not as long as the glaives that you mentioned. For these mice I‚Äôll craft a very heavy Orihalcum-Stellarheart alloy blade. I‚Äôll give them a pommel that doubles as a Nixie weight charm, it negates the weight of the sword as far as it‚Äôs concerned with the wielder. To them, it‚Äôs as light as swinging a thin stick of the same length. For others trying to fence with the mouse, the sword‚Äôs weight still applies.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn other words, it‚Äôs like the mice have enhanced strength and weight when using this sword.‚Äù Kinu said.

‚ÄúExactly. Then on the rain-guard I‚Äôll install a soulstone core, with a globe of protection spell on it. This allows the mice to charge in and start swinging with little to no consequence for a while, then, they can use their ability to teleport away before they get overwhelmed. The only question now is if you can train the mice to fight with them properly. I‚Äôve never seen Tixi Mice use anything more sophisticated than a club or an axe they picked up‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOur mice can.‚Äù Kinu assured him. ‚ÄúOur artificer has developed some interesting weapons from her homeland and our mice have been fastidiously keeping them well-maintained. They‚Äôve also practiced their fencing with each other with little prodding from us, they will learn to use these swords without issue, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well, now I just need to know how tall the mice are.‚Äù Chapelle said, Kvaris stood up and then lowered her open palm to give an estimate.

‚ÄúI would say about this tall, let‚Äôs be generous and say a little lower than this‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

A couple of minutes later, the girls had taken off all of their armor and weapons for Chapelle‚Äôs best and trusted assistants to sharpen and recondition. As the garm girls and the crocodile-folk resumed catching up, Sammy touched her earpice and spoke quietly, giving Ingrid an update.

‚ÄúSounds pretty good.‚Äù Ingrid said ‚Äúmy original plan was to equip the shadow mice with shotguns. Take them. The combination of the globe of invulnerability, as you describe it, and the excellent reach of the sword, compounded by their enhanced strength and weight will make them excellent for cutting down multiple opponents while the protective spell holds. Before it runs out, the mouse can just teleport back behind the golden mouse clone and resume shooting.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, we‚Äôll have it done.‚Äù Sammy said. She looked up and signalled to the Enthana sisters. Kvaris nodded.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have those swords done, and the wands of duality with daggers.‚Äù Kvaris said. ‚ÄúAnything special with them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll cost you.‚Äù Chapelle replied ‚ÄúBut yes. Since you mentioned the ones using these are shadow mice, I have a soulstone I can install with the Misdirection spell. It turns the user invisible while creating an illusion of them moving in the opposite direction. The ones I have are quite of a dud, it‚Äôs a tricky spell to work with after all. It doesn‚Äôt last long but it‚Äôs fine; its true value is to allow the mice to quickly reposition themselves‚Ä¶ now the price for all of that is‚Ä¶‚Äú

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take it. Make four of them.‚Äù Kvaris said, nodding as the crocodile smiled ‚ÄúThese are worthy investments, also, you can make the blades a little longer since they can just instantly swap with daggers‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Meanwhile, in front of the Church of Saint Ygris:**

While Sammy and the Enthanas were at Chapelle‚Äôs shop, Zefir now looked at the front gate of the Church of Saint Ygris. A metal fence painted black stood tall, highlighed by the towering bushes bearing colorful flowers. The gate was made of the same wrought iron-like material and yawned wide open, letting visitors come and go as they pleased. To the left and right of the entrance were two statues that looked straight out of a Japanese temple, two fierce-looking Nio-like guardian deities stared down at all entering and leaving, their expressions seemingly shifting depending on the viewer. The popular folk-story goes that all who pass by with a pure heart see encouragement and determination on their compassionate faces. The injured, sick and dying find their firm expressions one of mercy and comfort. Those who go with ill aim find their fierce expressions intimidating; warning them that such behavior will not be tolerated in this hallowed ground.

‚ÄúDestination confirmed, calibrating map of Teth-Odin‚Ä¶‚Äù Neith said over the radio.

‚ÄúDeviation?‚Äù Philia asked.

‚ÄúDeviation?‚Äù Viel parroted, not understanding the context.

‚ÄúA good ten percent, taking into account a lack of solid means to get an aerial view of the city.‚Äù Neith replied. ‚ÄúThe map is accurate, Kitty-Five.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see!‚Äù Viel said.

¬†

They stopped at a plaza across the street from the hospital, it reminded Zefir of the post-mass Sunday plaza back in his old hometown where it always looked festive on a mid-morning weekend in an attempt to catch the parishioners as soon as they flocked out of the church. He looked down as the mice started tugging at his legs and pointing excitedly at the food stalls.

Zefir crouched down and patted the mice who were squeaking something to him.

‚ÄúYou guys hungry?‚Äù

The mice shook their heads, but pointed at themselves and to the hospital, squeaking softly as they did.

A bulb went off at Zefir‚Äôs head.

Of course! He was lucky that he never needed to be in a medieval fantasy hospital yet, but he had a sneaking suspicion that this world probably was the same when it came to hospital food. After all, he had once sailed across the ocean several months ago, the destination was fortunately an island a few miles into the sea, quite visible on a clear day. The trip lasted a few days and just like an airport back on Earth, the port authorities were a soulless, humorless bunch who didn‚Äôt take too well to his attempts at small talk, earning him a gruff sigh from his Saint Bernard boss.

Smiling, Zefir got up.

‚ÄúAlright guys! Let‚Äôs get some food! Pick what you guys want to eat...if the rescued mice see you eating them, then they‚Äôll know it‚Äôs good.‚Äù Zefir said excitedly.

The mice responded happily, squeaking in joy and jumping up and down. Like excited children, the mice held his hands while others gently pushed him to the stalls, making the vendors chuckle in amusement as they saw the group. It gave more than a few the impression of excited children bringing their dad to them so they could have tasty treats.

Finally got my glucose meter and 2 trials of A1C taken.

First A1C came back at a 6.0 and a 126 average glucose, aka lower end of pre diabetic. OB had me go for a NST at my last appointment and everything was beautiful.

Most recent A1C came back (a week and 3 days in between the last one) and it was a 5.7 and a 115 average glucose. Average glucose is perfectly normal and A1C was only 0.1% out of range. Barely enough to consider as pre-diabetic.

Anyways- my fasting level today was 85. I had slept in super late as I‚Äôm 37 weeks now and I‚Äôve been sleeping a ton lately. Everything makes me tired.

Fasting was 85
1hr after dinner (had protein spaghetti and meatballs) was 98.
1hr after bedtime snack (had a whole green apple, peanut butter, almond crackers, cheese slices, and a decaf sugar free creamer coffee with whipped cream) was 104.

Is it possible I was misdiagnosed? That or is this just a very slim case of it?? I‚Äôve actually struggled to eat as often as I should throughout the day and to meet certain carb counts. Could this have made me get it? This is my first ever pregnancy so I‚Äôm very new to it all. My baby is definitely a GD baby I was told, as she was measuring 7 pounds at 35 weeks. I have another ultrasound this week to track her growth and see what‚Äôs going on. Anyone have a similar situation?

I live with my family and my room is right next to the shared restroom so I originally thought it was that until I realized it was in the hall, kitchen and living room and even up the stairs heading to our apartment. On our floor there‚Äôs only our apartment and our Nextdoor neighbors and we are on the top floor of the entire apartment. 

We had a guy from the gas‚Äôs company come out and he said it smelled like something died. He said it did not smell electrical or gas related. He asked the downstairs neighbors and they reported smelling nothing. He even checked the only place in our building with gas which was the water heater. Other than that our own unit is all electric. The smell is only around the stairs leading up to our unit and inside our unit. 

My mom says it smells like poopy sewer stink. I think it smells like rotten bitter coffee grounds. It keeps getting worse. We have no real vents in our apartment except for above the stove and that one leads out to the roof for food smoke. I do hear animals on our roof in the spring and in the winter I can clearly hear the rain on the roof echo in the vent so I know for sure it‚Äôs open to the outside up there. We have already run the garbage disposal, cleaned the fridge, run water in our drains, and taken out the trash. My building was built in the 70‚Äôs so hopefully nothings wrong with it.

Thought I should share my experience if anyone else was going to do the same thing and had questions or concerns, especially since this is the most extensive procedure I've had. I'll try to make this as short as possible.

Colonoscopy Prep (""Polyethylene glycol-3350, electrolytes, and ascorbate for oral solution"" by OCEANSIDE Pharmaceuticals - I have no idea what the generic name is).

Saturday - start liquid diet - tip: start when you wake up. Bone broth and lemon Jell-O makes you feel full. Gatorade for electrolytes.

Sunday - still on liquid diet. Went on a plane ride to another town for the day (I live on an island). Drink black coffee for appetite suppressant in the morn. Drink clear liquid (I had sprite, coconut water, and white Gatorade), and drink lots of it to stay hydrated and not be hangry later.

* Doctor said start prep at 5pm. I started at 7pm. If you have to start before a flight, start about 3.5 hours before boarding and be at the airport 3 hours before departure. Adjust according to you. If you're at a bigger airport then add an hour and drink the prep after security.
* Prep tasted like lemon/lime, a bit grainy, bitter aftertaste so I took sips of apple juice as a chaser.
* Tummy rumbles 30 minutes in, full waterhose at 830pm. Be near a toilet, but if you're used to diarrhea then it doesn't feel as bad. If you need to go, start heading there, but I wasn't running for my life nor was I camped in the bathroom. 
* What goes in will come out -  60oz of liquid in, expect 60oz of liquid out. Within 1.5 hours I felt ok to go through security and play some board games. Anytime I drank water, it came back out about 2 minutes later. I think if you haven't felt the need to go for about 30 minutes then there isn't a lot in your system. I wouldn't drink a lot of anything after - that's why I said drink lots throughout the day. I figured if you're taking your colonoscopy prep before a flight then be prepared for crazy things...
* Don't drink anything an hour before your departure time. When you get on that plane, keep warm and SLEEP! Go home/to the hotel and sleep some more.

Monday - colonoscopy check in at 915am - take 2nd dose at 5am, don't drink anything after 630am. Anything that comes out probably won't be clear, so if you're anxious about this, drink LOTS of water. This time be near the toilet. You'll go more often and your BMs will get more and more clear with a yellow tint, literally looks like pee. After an hour, or at 7am, I was able to go take a nap till check in time.

I think if I had taken the first dose at 11pm then I would have been pooping all night and wouldn't get any sleep until 630am.

For those who haven't had procedures like this before or haven't been put under anesthesia. 

* Have a friend or family escort you there and back (my hospital required it).
* If you're able to get pregnant, they'll make you do a pregnancy test.
* If you have piercings on your nose/lip area, take them out to fit the oxygen mask. Any other piercings, just be aware if they cauterize anything, there is a chance the current will go to that piercing and burn you. I kept mine in and they only cauterized one spot. Nothing happened. They might tape it down, or just make you take them out.
* If they have trouble finding a vein for your IV, they'll probably get the anesthesiologist to do it (happened to me, I'm a petite person and feint easily with needles).
* You'll be on your side (mine was the left). I was given a pillow to hug and one for between my knees.

And that's it! You'll wake up not recalling anything and the nurses and doctors will explain everything else for you!

Very brief symptoms/backstory: 

Always constipated before June 2020 - went on a camping trip, water came out every single time I ate 5 bites of anything. Thought: giardia? Not giardia - never went to doctors cause I had no insurance. Got better after 2 years, but BMs became yogurt-y and diarrhea spells every other week. Also could not eat anything before noon or else nausea and/or water poops... Nausea worsened a few months back, had acid reflex, throwing up, no appetite or just felt queasy after thinking about food. Rice and popcorn made my but into a firehose and apples made me throw up. All blood test results showed high eosinophil count, and low vitamins and neutrophils. Friend who has UC planted the idea that I may have some form of IBD.

1hg0bjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hg0bjg/my_bfs_dad_saw_me_topless_19f/,My bf‚Äôs dad saw me topless 19F,"My bf and I have been dating for almost a year now. We met in college and have had a really good relationship so far. Still somewhat in that honeymoon phase I think. We both aren‚Äôt from our college‚Äôs area and went home for winter break. His family lives down at the beach and they have an awesome place to just unwind in the winter. My bf invited me down and said they would buy my plane ticket and pick me up and all. I agreed and we scheduled and booked my flight there. It was my first time traveling myself so I was super nervous. My bf has a job back at home he works for experience and extra income. So when I landed his dad was nice enough to pick me up from the airport. 

It was just my second time ever meeting him but he was super sweet and very kind to me. He ended up stopping for me to get coffee since I got in early morning. After that we headed to my bfs place. His house was insane but was sad he wasn‚Äôt home but working when I got there. My bf‚Äôs dad brought my stuff in the house and was greeted by his mom. They grabbed my stuff and showed me my room for the stay. Which sucked I wanted to stay in my bfs room lol. But oh well I‚Äôm grateful they had me at least. 

When my bf got home finally we ended up grabbing food and hanging out. We had a very nice rest of the day as he took me around showing me his home town. 

The next day my bf headed to work just for a shorter day and wouldn‚Äôt be too long. I woke up and had some breakfast with his family. His dad offered to take me out on the boat afterwards while my bf was working so I wasn‚Äôt bored. It was a gorgeous day and it‚Äôs a boat so I wasn‚Äôt saying no! I got changed in a cute bikini and headed out with his dad on the boat. We had a really nice time as we stayed in the backwater for a little while he showed me around and then we finally went out into the ocean. When we got out there we hit some waves which was super thrilling. He was worried I‚Äôd get sea sick so we found a spot and just idled. I got up on the front of the boat where he had a pad for tanning or lounging. I ended up laying down and trying to get my tan on as he was vibing to his music and relaxing. 

After a little he came up and sat with me and talked about life. College, the past, his son and just pretty much everything we could. It was super nice to actually talk to my bf‚Äôs dad. He got up from sitting and as he was walking back he told me it was okay if I wanted to get rid of my tan lines. I asked him what he meant and he was said to not feel bad if I wanted to take my top off and fully tan. I awkwardly laughed and said I was okay. 

We kept talking when he came back up front and he ended up telling me again it was okay to go topless and fully tan. He claimed every girl including his wife will tan out in the water topless to get an even tan. Again I laughed and tried changing the topic. 

A few minutes later he brought it up again and was explaining how he didn‚Äôt want to come off wrong but just wanted me to feel comfortable and feel like I was at home. I sort of understood what he meant so I ended up slipping off my top. I could tell as I did he was trying not to look but I did catch him peaking. He offered me tanning lotion and sun block. I said I was okay and just laid there tanning as we talked a little more. 

We soon ended up having to head back as my bf was out of work soon. I put my bikini top back on we headed back in. I haven‚Äôt told my bf about it but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs weird or like bad. Nothing happened and he wasn‚Äôt like creepy when I was topless. ",0,1734401939.0,confessions,8,0.2,False
1hg0aqz,https://i.redd.it/d0i6pmt7jb7e1.jpeg,Belize did not disappoint!,"Our trip to Hopkins was a total dream!! Thanks to everyone in this sub who helped us plan!

Highlights‚Äî

The weather changing constantly and learning to roll with it 

A choppy boat ride to snorkel in the reef through a strong current, followed by a snorkel at a little island (pictured here) with crystal clear water and breathtaking beauty

 Hiking Antelope Falls where we were literally the ONLY people in the entire park. Swam in the waterfall at the top all by ourselves! 

Truly the nicest people in the world. Everyone there was so kind and curious and inviting and interesting. 

The food! We ate at local spots and a couple resorts. Big shout out to Roast for amazing coffee and breakfast and the best smoothies! 

Kayaking every single day and seeing starfish, manatees and a pod of dolphins!!! 

Biking around town to discover new places 

Listening to the ocean lull us to sleep at night, then hearing the rain on our roof as we slept peacefully 

We honestly can‚Äôt wait to go back. What a dream trip full of adventure, beauty, and wonder! ",50,1734401866.0,Belize,2,1.0,False

And then be so careless to spill it. And the only reason she‚Äôs in that store is because Remi is so desperate to please that she found out Alexis Oakley couldn‚Äôt get a dress shipped in time for a holiday party that she specifically reached out to let her know that she could pick it up from her while she was in New York? What compels someone to run an errand for their makeup artist on their vacation with their fianc√©e?

Also can‚Äôt get over the fact that someone who does a full face of makeup daily, gets a fuck ton of makeup PR, has an assistant and fianc√©e who can (and do) dote on her, had to go to a Sephora while on vacation to get a brow pencil?? ",45,1734401813.0,snarkingwithremi,4,1.0,False
