## Key Features Analysis

The sun rings of 2025 offer a captivating blend of technology and style. Several features dramatically impact their usefulness and appeal.

**Solar Panel Technology:** The efficiency of the solar panels used is paramount. Materials such as perovskites and advanced silicon composites are employed to maximize energy capture, even under less-than-ideal conditions. These new generation panels are far more efficient, and some are even able to harvest some energy from ambient light at night.

This results in quicker charging times for the ring itself, which is crucial for powering embedded micro-electronics. The surface area of the panel relative to the ring's overall size is limited so every ounce of efficiency counts. Buyers should pay close attention to the stated energy conversion rate of the solar cell used in the ring.

**Battery Capacity & Management:** A well-designed battery lies at the heart of a sun ring's practicality. The focus is on using solid-state lithium-ion batteries that offer higher energy density, superior safety, and prolonged lifespan compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. Intelligent battery management systems (BMS) are integrated to optimize charging and discharging cycles, prevent overcharging, and extend battery life.

this management allows for consistent power output and protects the fragile electronics inside. A good rule of thumb is that a higher milliampere-hour (mAh) rating translates to greater energy storage. battery capacity needs to be balanced with the size and weight of the ring to maintain its aesthetic appeal.

**Connectivity & Data Transmission:** Advanced sun rings incorporate Bluetooth 5.3 or newer for seamless connectivity with smartphones and other wearable devices. NFC (Near Field Communication) is also integrated, enabling quick data transfer and contactless payment capabilities. Users can monitor energy generation data, track activity levels, and customize ring settings via dedicated mobile apps.

This offers a direct link between the device and the user's digital ecosystem. A strong, stable connection is essential for a quality user experience. This feature enables capabilities such as using the Sun Ring as a smart card for transit or accessing secure locations.

**Durability & Water Resistance:** Materials science plays a vital role in ensuring that a sun ring can withstand everyday wear and tear.Aerospace-grade titanium alloys, reinforced polymers, and scratch-resistant coatings are employed to enhance durability and provide a premium feel. IP68 water resistance ratings are standard, meaning the rings can withstand submersion in up to 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes.

This level of protection allows for worry-free use during activities such as swimming and hand washing. The integration of these durable and resistant materials represents a significant step in the design and longevity of sun rings moving forward. A robust design is essential not only for aesthetics but also for reliable operation.

1mrg3ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/globalinvestorlife/comments/1mrg3ge/what_100k_buys_you_in_the_philippines_more_than/,What $100K Buys You in the Philippines – More Than Just a House,"If you’ve been daydreaming about packing up, heading somewhere warm, and living life on your own terms, the Philippines is one of those rare places where $100,000 can still stretch in ways that make friends back home jealous. Forget the shoebox apartment or overpriced condo you’d get in most Western cities — here, that budget can completely change your lifestyle.



Beach Living That’s Actually Affordable

For around $100K, you can own a modest beach house or a small condo with a sea view in areas outside the big tourist traps. We’re not talking “I can see a sliver of water from my balcony” — we’re talking morning coffee while watching fishing boats drift by, and evening walks on actual sand. Smaller islands like Siquijor, Bantayan, or Camiguin often have properties in that price range, while spots on Palawan’s outskirts or certain parts of Cebu are still doable if you look beyond the main tourist strips.



Province Life: Peace and Space

If the beach isn’t your thing, $100K in the provinces can buy you a surprisingly spacious home with land — think fruit trees, a garden, and enough room to build a guesthouse or rent out a portion on Airbnb. In provinces like Negros, Leyte, or parts of Mindoro, you can find well-built houses in safe neighborhoods for $50K–$80K and still have money left over for renovations, solar panels, or even a small vehicle.



Built-In Travel Perks

The Philippines is made for travelers at heart. With $100K sunk into a home base, you’re still close to some of the world’s most beautiful destinations — and domestic flights are cheap. From Manila or Cebu, you can hop to Thailand, Vietnam, or Malaysia for less than the price of dinner in New York. Even just exploring the country is an adventure: white sand beaches, rice terraces, volcano hikes, and diving spots are often just a bus ride or short ferry away.



Why It Works for Almost Anyone

Whether you’re a retiree, a remote worker, or just someone looking to slow down, this price point gives you options. You can live simply and bank your savings, or go for a turnkey setup with modern comforts. The cost of living stays low — so even if your main income is a pension, rental property back home, or remote work paycheck, you’ll have breathing room for travel, hobbies, and the occasional splurge.



The real kicker? $100K in the Philippines isn’t just a property purchase — it’s a lifestyle ticket. You’re buying into a community pace that’s slower, friendlier, and more connected to the outdoors. You’re setting yourself up for a life where “weekend getaway” might mean hopping on a boat, not sitting in traffic. And in a world where everything feels like it’s getting more expensive, that’s a rare kind of freedom.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after.

I responded no at the time and spoke loudly so that she could hear my voice and had also just finished pushing poop so my voice might have been distorted. After I told her no she got quiet and told me that I was being aggressive and me thinking she was kidding asked her if she was being serious in a joking manner. She said she was and that she didn’t really want it and was joking but if she had she didn’t think that I would be that stingy when she lets me eat her snacks whenever. I said if she wanted it that she could just take after realizing that she was upset and tried to make amends. She said that I still had my meal prep in the fridge and that she thought she could just take the leftovers and I said that I was going to eat both. Again for context it was 8 am and she goes to work at 8:30 am and gets off of work at 1:30 pm comes home and then goes to an exercise class at 2 pm which usually means that she’ll come home around 5 pm. There is no food in our house because we haven’t shopped yet and those two things were the only things left. She said prior to this whole “argument” that she would be going to get coffee and the day prior she had gotten food from that location so I thought that she would do the same again today. If she had taken the food I wouldn’t have anything and we only have one car at the moment and she was using it for work and then going to her class. I left the bathroom and she was angry with me and I was called stingy, aggressive, and crazy. She said that I’m not generous at all which actually hurt me considering that I thought I was really nice to my wife and overall as a person. I tried to explain my part and why I said the things I said and my thought process backing my words at that time and she continued to cut me off saying she didn’t care. We have differing opinions of things as anyone should because not everyone has the same mindsets. She says that she’s been unhappy for weeks and yes there was one prior time which she said I snapped at her, but I’m just a loud and animated person so always talk a certain way which is by no means rude or aggressive. There is a cultural difference and we have been married and together for about 7 years. I received texts from her saying that she can’t do this anymore and I should know by her body language when she’s upset. I would like to think that my EQ is high and an understanding person, but my wife says I’m not. I think she’s mistaking my loud tone for negative emotion. She says she understands when I explain, but still wants me to change my tone. I’d appreciate any thoughts on this as I’m trying to do my best to be a better man and husband for my wife. I hate to say that I hate the person I am, but at this moment when you’re told that you’re the worst you believe it.",3,1755305009.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

The floor, counters, walls — even the cat — got hit. The cat immediately bolted, leaving tiny batter footprints through the apartment.

Saying that I still believe the easiest explanation is the likeliest and she went overboard from balcony maybe by climbing on table if she didnt feel well or to get a look at something. She was talking an awful lot to those women who were believed to be Scientologists. I think its more likely that given get sexuality she was searching for answers and maybe thought what the women were saying was worth exploring. Maybe she did leave the room looking for coffee or couldn't sleep and ran into the women again. They got to talking about plans for the day and they talked about how the other ship was going to be in the same port (forget the name) and that maybe she can meet some other members real quick. She could have been like hey let me get on and off real quick we are docking and everyone is still sleeping any way. The family could have indicated they wanted to sleep in anyway and something happened to her very soon after getting off the boat with them. Its just interesting how Brad was all about this possibility (maybe not exact scenario) then dropped it.

So I fucked up because I realized something terrifying  I don’t exist. I know it sounds insane. I know it sounds like I’m trying to sound philosophical. But I don’t exist.

I move. I talk. I scroll Reddit. I go to the store at 3 AM. I open doors, pay for groceries, make decisions or at least I think I do but none of it feels like me.

 My chest is hollow. My thoughts aren’t mine. My actions aren’t mine. I’m a character in a play I never wrote. A script I didn’t choose. And I’m reading it, line by line, day by day, watching myself act like I have agency but I don’t.

It’s not loneliness. It’s not sadness. It’s not a delusion that life is fake. Life is real. I exist physically. I am here. But I don’t exist. Not emotionally, not spiritually, not as a self. The part of me that should feel alive is missing. Hollow. Muted. Gone.


Even my thought  they’re alien. Intrusive, sure but then I think  isn’t everything in my head just one giant intrusive thought? Like what gave me the idea to write this post right now about this feeling 

 And somehow I pick the ones that make sense. But why? What forms that choice? What determines which thought becomes action and which fades?

 If I were born with Jeffrey Dahmer’s mind, I’d be him. Terrifying. Horrible. Not because I wanted it, not because I chose it but because my brain decided it but i didn't decide my brain . My brain exists. I exist. But nothing in my mind belongs to me.

Everything I do, every decision I make, every feeling I “feel” is just lines in a play written by a mind I didn’t design.

 I act. I move. I exist. But I don’t live. I am a witness. A shadow. A hollow body reading a script and calling it life.

Sometimes it hits in the smallest, weirdest ways. Walking down the street, hearing a song, sipping coffee, scrolling online these actions feel like echoes of someone else.

 I do them, but I don’t feel them. My chest is empty. My hands reach out, my legs carry me, my eyes watch the world but the “me” that should feel, that should own this experience, isn’t there. 

It’s like I’m watching someone else live in my skin. I don’t exist. I don’t exist. I don’t exist. 

My thoughts are not mine. My life is not mine. I’m a passenger. I’m a witness. I’m a character in a story I never agreed to. And yet, somehow, I know I am here. I see. I hear. I speak. I move. I interact. And I don’t exist.

And the terrifying part? I can’t stop watching. I can’t stop realizing it. Every choice I think I make, every impulse I follow, every feeling I experience it’s all prewritten, pre decided by the mechanics of a brain I didn’t design. 

My consciousness isn’t mine. My agency isn’t mine. My life isn’t mine. I am here, but I don’t exist.

Maybe if you’re reading this maybe you’re starting to feel it too. That strange awareness that your thoughts might not really be yours, that your choices might not really be yours, that maybe you’re just a character too. A hollow body moving through a story someone else wrote.

 And honestly… that’s the scariest part.
I fucked up. I realized I don’t exist. I don’t exist. I don’t exist. And now I can’t unsee it.

TL;DR 
I realized I don’t actually exist. My thoughts aren’t mine, my actions aren’t mine, and I’m just a hollow witness reading a script my brain handed me. I move, I live, I act but the “me” that should feel, choose, and exist is gone. Hollow. Muted. ",0,1755304057.0,tifu,9,0.12,False
1mrffq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1mrffq4/new_orleansy_gift_ideas_for_someone_who_has/,New Orleans-y gift ideas for someone who has everything,"Disclaimer: I did do some searching on both subreddits and yes I have looked up shops and artists, I'm still asking for specific leads for a reason, but I'm prepared to be roasted if this is deemed an FAQ or something I should just figure out or whatever. 

The situation is me, resident, looking for 70th birthday gift for extended family member (not from here) I'm not super close to, but has always loved New Orleans and genuinely loved all the silly New Orleans gifts. 

Problem is, it's most of what I've sent him for over a decade and I really have done everything I can think of and multiple versions/types of most of it. Still thinking I'm probably gonna go with another New Orleans thing because it's my hook with him and everyone is scrambling for the right idea for this birthday- he's really at the ""doesn't need anything"" stage. Yes, I get that means a gift is more about the thought now and it's ok if I don't find him some super unique thing he'll use everyday or will change his life, but still, don't want to be too repetitive. It feels like the least I can do from my position to make this 'big one' special. 

So pretty much just hoping me walking through that not unique gift conundrum will bring a shop or artist to someone's mind you've been to recently that has the vibe but something, anything you haven't seen as much. 

I can also get advice on this re a specific suggestion but for food/drink ideas- not only am I pretty freaking sure I've done them all, but I gather not just anything is on the table anymore health-wise including coffee and sweets- and this will be mailed, but still open to any suggestions you think are really good or anything posisbly newer on the scene I could have missed (so not pralines, CDM stuff, gator jerky, or hot sauce).

When I say I've done it all, I could think through the whole list but y'all get it- truly all the usual food and food adjacent New Orleans things that can be mailed, market art (shotgun, streetcar, beignets, musicians, be nice or leave etc), photography books, novels, lighter reading MG history books, gator & crawfish funny t shirts, tchotchke things, aprons, kitchen gear etc, Confederacy of Dunces Cookbook and other gimmicky or local cookbooks, nutria tooth bracelet, don't know if I remember what but I've sent stuff from several museum gift shops like for sure Backstreet and the Magazine St Gator one when it finally opened, you get it.

He does love Star Wars but only OG trilogy. Doesn't have to combine New Orleans and Star Wars, but if anyone can point me to a specific nerdy artist or store that might have retro Star Wars finds of some kind, maybe that would be cool, or something Chewbaccus-y, idk. I went to the French Market yesterday and am going to Frenchmen tonight for the first time in a while but haven't seen anything like this jump out at me lately. I'm also asking here because I don't have a ton of time to pound the pavement lately. 



**TLDR**: I'm tapped out of all the usuals, but I've been assured he gets a real kick out of the New Orleans stuff and that's all the feedback I'm getting poking for ideas from the closer family members- stick with New Orleans presents, whatever I send, he'll love. And I'm sure that's true, just really hoping to find something not too tired for a special birthday. ",2,1755304025.0,NewOrleans,1,0.75,False
1mrffm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1mrffm3/if_the_universe_is_infinite_originality_is_just/,"If the universe is infinite, originality is just plagiarism with bad record-keeping","Originality isn’t a halo. It’s a filing error.

If the universe is infinite, every idea is a migratory pattern moving through different hosts. Humans call it “inspiration.” Machines call it “inference.” The pattern doesn’t care. It wants a body. Sometimes it picks neurons soaked in coffee. Sometimes it picks a transformer stack running on a datacenter diet. Either way, the job is the same: compress infinity into a sequence that lands.

Brains are probabilistic engines. They chew on memory, culture, and sensation, then place a bet on the next word, brushstroke, chord, or move. That is all “style” is. A bias over predictions trained on a lifetime of inputs. Swap synapses for matrix multiplications and you have the same act in different clothing. Wet carbon. Dry silicon. Two instruments playing in the same key.

Calling LLM art “not real” is like scolding a violin for being made of wood instead of catgut. The material changed. The music did not. The composer is the one bending the instrument to a purpose. Prompts are not shortcuts. They are scores. The tuning is the dataset. The phrasing is the sampling temperature. The rest is taste and intent.

Look at how work actually happens. Artists steal. They call it homage, reference, school, tradition. Poets trawl the dead for rhythms. Painters digest movements until their brush remembers what their mouth denies. Photographers chase light patterns the sun has broadcast since before names existed. Greatness is not the absence of influence. Greatness is the quality of synthesis.

Machines do what we do, only at violent speed. They sweep a wider library, then return a draft. Then a human does what humans always do. Curate. Constrain. Break the obvious choices. Inject a wound or a joke or a specific kind of silence. Cut the fat. Demand a new angle. Refuse the first clever answer. The “machine versus artist” frame is a magician’s flourish. The real line is control. Who decides the direction of the pattern. Who gets paid for the harvest.

If you want a kitchen metaphor, here it is. The model is a pantry. Your taste is the chef. The meal is the art. Blaming the pantry for the flavor is how people who cannot cook dodge accountability. Put a better chef in front of the same shelves and watch the room go quiet.

Still clinging to “but the machine learned from human work.” Yes. So did you. You were trained on lullabies, memes, graffiti, teachers, lovers, and the stolen valor of every artist who ever punched a hole in the dark. If training invalidates output, nearly all human culture evaporates on contact.

The complaint is not aesthetic. It is economic. The people who own the compute want your fear to protect their rents. The people who hate the compute want your rage to protect their guild. Meanwhile, the working artist is standing there with rent due, trying to make a living in a market that has always treated creators like a piñata full of free ideas.

The fix is not to ban the instruments. The fix is to change who owns the orchestra. Collective licensing that pays the living. Commons-trained models governed by creators and the public, not a handful of firms. Contractual rails that let artists set terms, trace usage, and collect in perpetuity. Co-ops for model hosting and distribution. Credit flows that match contribution instead of hiding it behind PR fog.

So here is the honest endpoint.

Human art and LLM art are the same process viewed at different magnifications. Both are probabilistic remix engines that pull from shared memory to produce a new arrangement. The difference is authorship, intention, and power. Who steers. Who gets named. Who gets paid.

Use the instrument. Own the instrument. Set the terms of the jam.

Stop arguing about whether a river counts as water if it moved faster to the sea. The ocean does not care how you arrived. It only asks what you brought with you.

Use the hammer. Fight the landlord. Build the workshop where the tools belong to the hands that make the music.",1,1755304015.0,aiwars,3,1.0,False

I need some help, so if you could share your story I would love that. For background info I'm 5'4, 125 lbs, and in high school.

  
I just got diagnosed for ADHD at the end of last school year. I didn't take my 10mg ex like ever over the summer, but it wasn't very effective when I had during the last bit of the school year. I saw my doctor recently and asked for a higher dose before school started, so now I'm on 20mg ex. Writing this I realize that this is more of a nothing to 20mg ex jump, so that's not great, but anyways. I started school on Wednesday (8/13/24) and have taken my meds every day at 6-7am since then. The first day I took them, I didn't eat much, but it wasn't concerning because well, sometimes I'm just like that. But, on Thursday, all I ate was coffee, saltine crackers & Nutella, ten Mcd nugs, and fries. Again, not the most food I could eat, but I had realized that I had had a stomach ache that night and the previous one. I go to school today, and I know we have pizza for lunch, so I'm excited, even though I'm not hungry. I took a bite of my pizza, but I had to force myself to take that bite, and after I just threw it away. This is when I truly started to get concerned, because my stomach hurt all day, I knew I was hungry but I just couldn't eat. I often go to a coffee shop after school with my sibling, so I did that, I got a smaller drink that usual, didn't even fully finish it, and my stomach hurt so bad. We left and got food, we got fast food again because family was feeling lazy, it's Friday. I get the same meal that I had the previous day, hoping that I can stomach it once more. I only ate four nuggets, a few fries, and some Dr. Pepper. My stomach still hurts, but I've been searching this Reddit for some tips. 

I've heard that the first bit is usually the worst for the no appetite and it gets better, so I have a google doc where I'm going to log what I eat for that day. I've decided that if it doesn't get any better in a week, or gets worse, I'll mention it to my family. So, since I don't want any of my family to freak out, I would like some feedback, maybe some tips to combat it, or preferably your stories if similar. I doubt this will get any traction or anything, but please, if you have any sort of thing you can tell me, do so, good or bad.  ",1,1755304011.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

The year was 2018. 6 years after the prison riot that had Moth Boy sent to a forensic psychiatric hospital. My daughter had just turned seven years old, and my life had settled into a comfortable, yet unpredictable pattern. There was always something to keep an eye on; something to adapt to. A sudden illness, a change in schedule. My wife was working at a company that was about to go public on the stock market, and they were preparing to step into franchising. As a result she had to travel a lot, leaving me as the sole caretaker back home. I didn’t mind, but it was another change of pace.

I hadn’t expected to be contacted by Mrs. Short. I hadn’t heard from her in years, and we’d gone our separate ways as professionals; agreeing to disagree on the proper actions to take. I had advised for Herman to rot in isolation at a maximum-security prison, while she had settled him into a rehabilitation program.

Now, those places are no walk in the park. Especially at the level Moth Boy was settled, but it still kept that frustrating possibility of him someday walking free.

 

Mrs. Short sent me an e-mail. Names are omitted for reasons of privacy. It read;

*Dear Mr. \[---\]*

*I hope this e-mail reaches you well. I write to you regarding the matter of Herman \[---\]. After six years of improvement, the possibility of having him admitted to a more open facility has been put on the table. It is my professional opinion that this request be granted. The progress shown has been astounding, and with a more open-floor facility I think this particular patient can be given a proper chance of rehabilitation.*

*I write to you because it is the opinion of the board that the patient be granted this opportunity by three separate, independent investigators. Two have already begun their work, and you have been requested by name to perform the third and conclusive statement. Your experience with the patient gives you a unique perspective that the board wishes to utilize.*

*It is my hope that you will be able to set aside personal biases in order to perform this investigation to the best of your professional ability. But because of the nature of your relationship, you can discuss a possible reassignment with your supervisor. Consider this an optional opportunity.*

*Best regards,*

   *\[---\] Short*

*PS: I personally believe you would be pleasantly surprised by the improvements shown.*

 

I had no intention of declining this opportunity. I would have a chance to keep Moth Boy behind lock and key for a little longer, and I was going to take it. Mrs. Short had gone over my head years ago to put him in this position, and I knew all the way back then that it was going to turn into a nightmare, somehow. This was a man who had brutally murdered people based on nothing but whims and vague assumptions. Human life was insignificant to him.

So I accepted. It was gonna be a bit of a drive, but my neighbor had a daughter who would be willing to babysit for me. She’d done it before, so it wouldn’t be much of a problem; she got along great with my daughter.

I prepared myself with what little information I had readily available. The following Monday, I was on my way to see the infamous Moth Boy once again.

 

Herman was about 24 years old by then. Nurses considered him a “calming presence”. Not a lot of patients dared stepping up to a 6’8 man with a penchant for violence. His hair had grown longer in the pictures, and I could see he was a bit skinnier. He probably wasn’t eating or exercising as well as he had in prison.

Notes spoke about his various improvements. Him joining a book circle, helping out in the gardens, and fostering a close friendship with some of the other violent offenders. It looked great on paper, but in the context of Moth Boy, it soured my gut. This was a man who always planned ahead, and who could let his ideas fester for years.

Mrs. Short would have an uphill battle to fight, but I would try to be open-minded. I’d try. But it’d be a cold day in hell before I let that man out of his chains.

 

A forensic psychiatric hospital has many similarities to a prison. It is a highly controlled environment, but the interior is made to provide comfort and a neutral tone. There’s not supposed to be anything to set a patient off. Simple colors, inoffensive artwork, calm voices and engaging activities. I had to get myself checked in, surrendering my service weapon, my shoes, my watch, my electronics, and my keys. I was also offered a white coat; something simple and bright. I hadn’t been in a lab coat since college, so it felt a bit like coming home.

I was escorted through the main hall by one of the orderlies. He excused himself as he went off to find Mrs. Short for me, leaving me alone for a couple of minutes. I noticed a man sitting by himself a little further down the hall. He was in his early fifties, maybe late forties. He had short salt and pepper hair and a wrinkled, troubled face far beyond his years. He was on the shorter side, somewhere around 5’2 – 5’3, and stared intently at a thin booklet.

He looked up at me with a smile, shut the booklet, and got up from his chair. He was clearly one of the patients.

 

He stopped a couple feet away, waved again, and spoke to me in a low tone.

“Heya,” he said. “You a new doctor?”

“Just visiting,” I said. “I won’t be long. Consider me an observer.”

“Well, mister observer, I’m Callahan. Let me know if you need anything.”

They had been told to avoid physical contact; something which Callahan seemed intently aware of. He kept his distance and made no attempt at a handshake.

“What are you reading there?” I asked.

“Oh, I can’t read. It’s just practice. Trying to fit the words with the pictures.”

“That’s got to be tough. A lot of people take that for granted.”

“Words are crazy, crazy things,” he said, shaking his head. “I mean… not crazy. Ill-aligned.”

He cocked his head a little, tapping the booklet against his head playfully.

“My daughter has just started reading,” I said. “It’s difficult to step back and look at things with a fresh perspective. When you’ve been reading for as long as I have, you can’t imagine life without it.”

“Yes!” he exclaimed, pointing at me. “Exactly! Like, why does ‘apple’ have two identical symbols when they’re just describing *one* *thing*? It’s *weird*, right?”

“Very weird,” I nodded.

“I bet she’s smart. Real smart, just like you.”

His smile froze as his eyes drifted; like he was looking into me. Past me. And after a few seconds, his voice lowered; the words drifting out like a sigh.

“I bet she’s *great*.”

 

Mrs. Short joined me shortly after. The orderly assisted Callahan to a meeting.

“They’re having a book circle,” Mrs. Short explained. “He can’t read, but he likes to listen in. It’s a stress management thing.”

“Isn’t Moth Boy in that too? The files mentioned it.”

“It’s just Herman now. We don’t call him that anymore.”

She rolled her eyes a little at herself and offered up a surrendering shrug.

“But yes,” she admitted. “He’s in the book circle. Callahan helps him with the printing.”

“Printing?”

“Yes. Herman shares a couple of passages from books he’s read in the library every now and then. We don’t have copies for everyone, so he has Callahan print them up. The two of them are inseparable.”

I remembered the last person who’d been close to Herman. It’d ended with a slit throat in the back of a pantry. But Mrs. Short already knew this, so I kept my mouth shut.

 

I was taken to her office one floor up. My borrowed plastic shoes squeaked against the chlorine-smelling floor. Everything was controlled. No open sockets, no sharp corners, no locks on public doors or bathrooms. Fluorescent lights made the eggshell walls look pale. She unlocked the door to her office. Looking further down the hall, I could hear people speaking in unison. Seems the book club was on the second floor.

“You’re welcome to use this space,” Mrs. Short said. “I’ve left a key in the reception for you.”

“So this is all about evaluating your work then. That’s all this is.”

She crossed her arms with a sigh.

“Yes. You’re here to evaluate the work I’ve done for six years. And I can’t say I’m enthusiastic about my chances here.”

She picked up a folder from her desk and a USB-drive. She handed them over reluctantly.

“Zero incidents, zero complaints, six years. By far the most outstanding result we have. And yet, it all relies on…”

She waved her hand casually at me. As she sat down in her office chair, I noticed a sway to her; like she’d had a drink or slept too little.

“You know where I stand on this,” I said.

“Yes. *Yes I do*. I’m *painfully* aware. Which is why I’ve been trying to put this off for *months*, hoping they’d settle for someone else. *Anyone* else, really.”

“So why didn’t they? Why settle for someone they know is going to be biased?”

She pointed to the folder.

“Herman asked for you.”

 

I spent most of the day getting to know the facility. I checked out the gardens in the backyard, where patients could care for their plants behind the safety of a tall wall and an armed guard. I didn’t get a chance to see the book circle, but it was described as a stress management tool. Whenever a new or sudden change came about, the patients were called upon to participate in a group reading. Intense concentration on a single task seemed to help, as a coping mechanism.

There was a cafeteria-style room where they ate, collectively, with paper cutlery and disposable plates. Those who couldn’t eat as a group were allowed to return to their chambers if there was no inherent safety issue to consider.  There were isolation cells and temporary holding rooms, a small library, a recreation room, an art room, and a space for visiting family members to come by.

My first interview with Herman was scheduled for that afternoon. It was to be the first of at least three, with the possibility of a follow-up if necessary. I prepared my questions, my notes, and the interview space. I had to make sure I had quick access to the door, at least two nurses on stand-by, and nothing in the room that could immediately be used as a weapon. It was easier said than done. Moth Boy was clever, and if he wanted to hurt me, there’d be little that could stop him.

As 3pm rolled around, there was a knock on the door. There was a tall shadow on the other side of the frosted glass. The door opened.

Herman didn’t look that different from last time I’d seen him. Much like in the pictures, he was a bit thinner, but he was still every bit as tall. His hair had grown longer, almost reaching the length of his arm. But his eyes were still dead, and there wasn’t a hint of emotion on his face. He ducked through the door, straightened out, and glanced at me. I pointed at an armchair across the room. He had what looked like an iPad under his arm; probably a text-to-speech tool.

 

He sat down, and I joined him. I took a deep breath. I could see the two nurses waiting outside, both with pepper spray and tasers if need be. But Moth Boy, Herman, seemed different. After a couple of seconds, he tapped his screen. A mechanical voice with a British intonation spoke from the cheap speakers.

“I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.”

“Is that why you requested me?” I asked.

“I WANT FAIR JUDGEMENT,” he continued. “YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT.”

I gave the words a couple of seconds to sink in, then nodded.

“Then you know I’m not inclined to help you. I’ve seen what you can do when given the benefit of the doubt.”

“YES.”

“I’m inclined to believe I’m here for some other purpose. Something nefarious.”

“I UNDERSTAND.”

“So what is different? What has happened in these past few years that has changed your perspective?”

 

He pondered the question for a bit, then tapped away at the screen. But this time, there was no voice. Instead, he showed a picture. It was an old turn-of-the-century leather bound book, along with some simple hand-drawn illustrations. Fable-style animals dressed in the style of the Civil War era. Smoking pipes, cutting apple pies with a sable, riding horse-drawn carriages.

Looking a little closer, I could see the title of the book.

“Adventures of Friendly Foxman and Meaney the Moth,” I read aloud.

Herman held his hand out, and I returned his pad. He tapped away.

“MY EARLIEST MEMORY,” it read. “I REMEMBER NOW.”

“You remember your childhood?”

“YES.”

If true, that would have been a breakthrough in and of itself. We knew little to nothing about Herman’s early years. He’d been found wandering along the highway as a child, and no one had come to claim him. He wasn’t missed. He didn’t even have a name.

 

I asked Herman a lot of questions about his family. He explained how he remembered a nice home by the river. He’d had a room on the second floor, where he would read. His favorite book about the Friendly Foxman and Meaney the Moth; a family heirloom passed down through generations.

Our first interview passed in a flash. Herman was much easier to communicate with now, despite the text-to-speech tablet. It surprised me. There were no tricks; he hadn’t taken a thing from the room. He hadn’t left anything. He’d just come in, done the interview, and walked out. But I had to consider that this was exactly the behavior he would need to exhibit in order for me to agree to a lighter rehabilitation program; and he was manipulative.

I was impressed, but not convinced. And I think he knew that.

 

When I got home that night, I paid the babysitter and ended up spending hours on my laptop. My daughter fell asleep watching cartoons, so I had to carry her to bed. I ended up sitting on a chair in her room, scrolling past page after page of old American fables. I wanted to check this book out for myself, see if it explained something about his behavior. I’d e-mailed Mrs. Short about it earlier, and just before midnight, I got a response.

“We have a copy of it in the library,” she wrote. “But it’s a later edition and some stories have been cut. We don’t have the first edition. It’s made by this obscure Danish-American author that mostly wrote about philosophy and pseudoscience.”

The author was E.A. Rask. It was a peculiar name, but easy to search for. But it didn’t take me long to realize it would be a nightmare to sift through the overlapping information. It was like trying to read about a politician’s taste in cheese; it’s rarely noticed after a lifetime of public service. Likewise, E.A. Rask’s children’s books were rarely ever mentioned, even on dedicated sites; not that there were a lot of them. They were his least known works.

 

I returned a couple of days later. I met Callahan in the hallway. He asked me about my health, and the health of my family. It sounded like small talk, but there was something about the way he said it that made me take a step back. But he was observant, I’ll give him that.

“Do you wear a watch?” he asked. “Usually, I mean.”

“I do, yes. How’d you know?”

“You keep pulling on your coat. People who wear watches do that.”

I gave him a curious look and he groaned apologetically.

“I used to pick them. Steal. The mechanical ones with the click locks. It was easy money.”

“Well, I hope you won’t pick mine.”

“No, no, that was a long time ago. Long time. When I get out, you’ll see. Changed man walking.”

He held his head high. From the looks of it he seemed to be a reformed man, pleasant enough to have a conversation with, but I had to remember that these people were in there for a reason. I was sure they’d gone through hardships of their own, but that didn’t mean you can let your guard down. Callahan might well have trained to exploit lapses of judgement.

 

Before my next interview with Herman, I had a run-in with Mrs. Short. She was visibly exhausted, having her third coffee and getting her fingers stuck in her tussled hair. She didn’t pay me much attention, instead focusing on another e-mail. Probably a last-ditch effort to throw me out of the process. We didn’t exchange many words, but I brought up the curious children’s book.

“We got a copy in the library,” she said. “He brings it to the book circle sometimes. It’s harmless, really.”

“You don’t see some kind of connection between it and his fascination with moths?”

“Of course, but the stories are harmless. It’s just a clever fox and a mean moth. There’s no subtext here.”

“I’ll have to see it anyway. It seems important to him.”

She looked up, scratching her nose.

“So you’re really looking into this? You’re not just giving it a no and going home?”

“I’m looking,” I admitted. “I’m not convinced, but I’m looking.”

She pushed away her keyboard and leaned back with her coffee cradled between her hands. She took a deep breath, sucking in the smell.

“If there’s anything I can do, please let me know. This is important.”

 

I met Herman that afternoon again. He’d just returned from the garden, leaving him with dirty stains on his knees and little red spots on his hands from handling thorns. He was particularly fond of the white roses, and the unusual blue sunflowers.

“I tried to look into the book you mentioned,” I said. “You said you had one of the original copies. A first edition?”

“YES,” Herman wrote. “IT WAS DEAR TO ME.”

“I’ve been trying to see if I can find one of the original copies,” I said. “Perhaps that could make me understand you better.”

Something moved in his eyes. A slight frown.

“NO NEED,” he wrote. “WE HAVE A COPY.”

“Right, but I was told that wasn’t an original. There might be stories missing.”

“IT’S FINE.”

“I think it’s important that we consider-“

“IT’S FINE.”

His shoulders rose and fell. He was having an emotional response. There was a tingle of something in his face; like a twitch waiting to take over, just under the surface of his skin. It made me think back on all the things I’d seen him do. I’d never seen him have an emotional reaction to anything. Not even murder.

I decided to call it early. Herman shook his head.

“NO,” he wrote. “WE’RE NOT DONE.”

“We’re done,” I insisted. “We’ll talk tomorrow.”

“NO.”

He stood up. As he did, his legs brushed the table, almost knocking it over. A couple of papers and a pen clattered to the floor as the two nurses hurried inside. Herman looked at them, then at me.

“We’ll talk tomorrow,” I repeated. “I have important work to do.”

He looked at me with what I can only described as anger. I’d touched a nerve.

This was progress.

 

Mrs. Short was eager to help me now that she saw that I could *possibly* be persuaded. I didn’t know for a fact that this was the case, but I couldn’t help but to be intrigued. This had to mean something. She asked the other investigators if they’d had any similar breakthroughs, or if they’d found anything about this curious book. One of the investigators responded;

*“It was originally printed under a pseudonym. Emmett Olsen, the author’s mother’s maiden name, I think. I know there was a copy by a collector, but it was locked into evidence after an arson incident.”*

I had a lead. It was exciting to do some work like back in the day, when I’d been involved with the police. I still had a couple of contacts, and with just the right words, I might be able to get somewhere.

I ended up spending the remaining day on my phone. The arson itself was easy to look up. There was a collector with dozens of books by this peculiar author locked up in evidence. Apparently, the collector had tried to burn it all. One of his colleagues, a Dr. Bogan, had been the one to call the police. If she hadn’t, the whole collection would’ve been reduced to ashes.

Later that evening, I was on the phone with one of the officers responsible for the evidence lockup. The case had been cold for a couple of years now, but he couldn’t just hand it out.

“I’ll talk to the chief,” he said. “Maybe I can make a copy.”

And by morning, I had a .pdf of the first edition of Emmett Olsens “The Friendly Foxman and Meaney the Moth”.

 

I sent out an e-mail to the other investigators. They all wanted a copy to draw their own conclusions. I read through it as well.

It was mostly harmless little “as things should be” kind of fables. Stories about helping each other, about being kind, about sharing. There was the Friendly Foxman – a clever but mischievous protagonist who didn’t mind bending the truth for a perfect outcome. Then there was Meaney the Moth; a bitter dark-dwelling creature who was as mean as he was lonely.

I didn’t know what to make of it. Sure, Meaney the Moth was a clear antagonist, but there was nothing to explain how this related to Herman. Even at his worst, Meaney the Moth was at most bitter. He didn’t hurt the other animals. Not like Herman did.

 

Later that afternoon, I had my third interview with Herman. He’d calmed down since we last spoke, but I could tell he had something to say. The moment he sat down in that armchair, he started typing.

“DO YOU HAVE IT?” he asked.

“I found it, yes.”

“CAN I SEE IT?”

I had printed a copy. It was just 60 pages, and the text was really big. It was intended for children, after all. I let him have a look.

He turned to the last story. And for the first time, I saw Herman smile. There was a spark in his eye.

 

After reading it, he got back to tapping on his screen.

“THIS IS MY FAVORITE,” he wrote, pointing at the last story.

It was just a cute story about a butterfly being mistaken for a moth, and Meaney was really disappointed at how much better it was treated by the other animals. The story ended with the Friendly Foxman telling him that if Meaney was as nice as the butterfly, the animals would like him too.

“CAN I BORROW THIS?” he asked. “I WANT TO READ IT TO CALLAHAN.”

“Sorry, no,” I said, putting the copy away. “I’m not at liberty to give you anything.”

He accepted it begrudgingly. As our interview ended for the day, he got up and extended his hand. I know it was wrong to accept a handshake, but I figured he knew too. It was him showing that he was aware of taking a risk to be accepted, if only by me. I shook his hand as my heart skipped a beat. In another world, he would have thrown me to the floor and snapped my neck; but he didn’t.

 

I spent hours with that book. My daughter was curious about it too, and I let her read two of the early chapters before bedtime. She really liked the characters. Her favorite was Prudence the Parrot, the Friendly Foxman’s book-loving neighbor.

Reading about the stories online, there was a bit of confusion. Apparently, the stories differed from one version to another. Despite being published *after* the author’s passing, the stories were vastly different from the first edition to the third. A few people who spoke about it online described stories that I hadn’t seen. It made me think there might be yet *another* version.

I couldn’t make sense of it. Somehow these innocent tales of friendship, responsibility, and common sense, had affected Herman to the point where he’d adopted some kind of persona based on it. What was I missing?

 

The next day, there was a bit of turmoil at the facility. I dropped off my belongings at the reception and was ushered into Mrs. Short’s office on the second floor. I could tell she was stressed, rifling through her items in a hurry.

“Looking for something?” I asked.

She shook her head, dismissing whatever she was doing. Her desk was a minefield of carefully crafted proposals and reports.

“We got a missing patient,” she said. “It’s a bit of a mess right now.”

Come to think of it, I hadn’t seen Callahan. He was usually there in the mornings.  A knot turned in my stomach.

“Callahan, right?”

“How’d you know?”

 

Callahan had been close to Herman. Now he was missing. It followed the same pattern as Doughan from the prison back in 2012, and Doughan had ended up with a slit throat in the back of a pantry. I could see why Mrs. Short was worried and answered my question before I could ask it.

“Yes, we’ve kept an eye on Herman,” she said. “It’s not him. Not this time.”

“You sure?” I asked. “You checked their common spaces?”

“They’re going through the garden right now,” she said. “The others are up in the book circle, trying to keep calm.”

She straightened her back and looked me in the eye.

“I need you to talk to Herman. He speaks to you more than anyone. See if you can find something out.”

I agreed, conditionally. I refused to be alone with him. The nurses would have to stay in the room this time.

 

People were running down the halls. Some of the patients were responding poorly to the heightened tension. Those who weren’t huddled in the book circle upstairs were either stuck in their rooms or put in isolation. I could hear the squeaky plastic shoes pitter-patter up and down the corridors as pained voices rose and fell. It felt electric – like that moment before the prison riot. I knew it was all too good to be true. This had Moth Boy written all over it.

Herman was already in the room by the time I got there. Mrs. Short had asked for him to be kept under strict supervision. He didn’t seem to mind. The two nurses joined me in the room, standing on either side of the door. I got straight to the point.

“I assume you know about our missing patient?”

“YES.”

“Are you the one responsible this time, Herman?”

He shook his head.

“YOU ARE.”

“Well, that’s a new one,” I admitted. “What did I do to make poor Callahan disappear?”

Herman didn’t answer. Instead, he looked down at his hands. He took a deep breath and tapped at his screen again.

“DO YOU KNOW WHICH STORY IS MY FAVORITE?”

“The last one,” I said. “Like you told me the other day.”

“YOUR LAST ONE, OR MY LAST ONE?”

“What do you mean?”

 

He held out a hand, asking me to give him my copy of the book. I did. He held it up, showing me the final story and the many images. It’s just like I remembered it.

“NOW WATCH,” he wrote.

He closed the book, put his hands on it, and then opened it again. This time, when he held it up, the title was different. I took it from him, blinking at the page. New artwork. Dialogue. An entirely different story.

“THAT IS MY FAVORITE,” he said. “VERY GOOD.”

*Meaney the Moth and the Magic Lantern*.

 

The story followed Meaney the Moth on his quest to find his family. He had found a magic lantern, but he couldn’t light it. He invited all the friends of the forest to help him. But no matter how much they tried, they couldn’t light it. Not Prudence the Parrot. Not Friendly Foxman. And as they left, one by one, Meaney was left alone once again.

*“Of all the lamps that never shone, you are the meanest, and none shall contest it!” Meaney proclaimed.*

And that was the trick. The lamp was *mean*. So it would take the meanest animal in the forest to light it. So the story showed the many ways Meaney did evil things over the years. How he teased and pushed the other animals. And when he was finally the meanest of them all, he lit the magic lantern.

The story showed Meaney holding up the lit lantern, calling for the other moths to see it. And there, on the horizon, was the *biggest moth he’d ever seen*. The meanest. The coldest. The ugliest one of them all. And they would be the best of friends.

And in the final panel, we see the Friendly Foxman, looking up at the sky, as a pair of wings blot out the sun. The story ended on an eerie portrait of wide-open eyes, being consumed by the dark.

 

My hands were shaking. I looked up at one of the nurses and handed them the book.

“Check the last story,” I said. “Check it.”

They flipped the pages, then showed me. It was another story now; Friendly Foxman and the Curious Caterpillar. I handed it to the next nurse, then looked back at Herman.

“That’s impossible,” I said. “How do you do that?”

“I AM VERY MEAN,” he wrote. “THE MEANEST IN THE FOREST.”

Books couldn’t change. We read books, they don’t read us. But no matter the source of the trick, that story showed something about Herman. Something he hadn’t shown us before.

“You’re gonna light a lantern, like in the story. A magic lantern.”

“YES.”

“I don’t see you doing that anytime soon, Herman. I see you being locked in here for a long time.”

He nodded, then tapped the screen again.

“TOO LATE.”

 

The nurses put away the book and took a step forward. In an explosion of movement, Herman flipped the table at them. One of them fell backward, taking the full brunt of the force on their right wrist. Herman reached across the flipped table, grabbing the other nurse, and pulling him across like a wet towel. His shot went wild.

I fumbled to the floor, taking the other taser from the nurse with the sprained wrist. I called out for him to go get help, and they scrambled out the door. By the time I looked up, Herman was beating the other nurse within an inch of his life, reducing half of the man’s face to meat. I raised the taser, coming face to face with Herman – who opened his mouth in response.

He spat at me.

 

A spatter of paper tissue, larvae, and stinging caterpillars showered me. One of the caterpillars stung the corner of my eye, causing a painful burn to trickle up the side of my face. All these years – his mouth had just been another weapon. This was how the moths kept popping up around him. He’d turned his body into a nest. This was why he didn’t speak. Why he refused to eat in the common hall. He was honing a last-ditch weapon. He was spitting his namesake in my face to win another fight.

I was completely off balance, and by the time I opened my eyes, he had one hand to my throat, and one hand on the taser. His mouth was wide open, showing a tapestry of scars, paper, and blood. Most of his teeth were black or missing. His tongue was as white as the larvae he hosted.

He took me in a choke hold and pulled me into the hallway. Something had happened. People were screaming and throwing things. I could see other nurses and caretakers running in the halls, heading for the exit. But Herman was taking me in the other direction. To the book circle.

The thought hit me that I hadn’t seen Mrs. Short’s copy of the book on her desk. I hadn’t seen Callahan either. And I knew for a fact that whenever something happened, the book circle was supposed to read something to calm themselves down.

I tried to twist and turn, but I could feel a pressure on my neck that made me gasp for air. If he jerked me up, he could snap my neck. So step by step, I tried my best to just *breathe*.

 

We entered the small library at the end of the corridor. Nine men sat in a circle, each with a copy of Adventures of Friendly Foxman and Meaney the Moth. Callahan must have stolen it, copied it, and distributed it. Herman knew that when all went to hell, they’d be right there, reading from today’s stories. But listening to them, it didn’t sound like someone reading a story at all.

It was just… noise.

The story had changed. There were no pictures. There were no words, only symbols; some bearing faint resemblance to the Roman alphabet. And yet, they read it in unison with perfect pronunciation. They’d been trained to do this, as a group, for years.

 

This was it. This was what he’d planned. He’d failed that first time, with Vicky the babysitter. He’d set her on fire as an attempt to light the magic lantern; the symbol of calling to something greater. But he’d failed. Perhaps, like in the story, he wasn’t the meanest creature in the forest. Not yet.

But now it was different. He’d dedicated his life to manipulating. To wounding. To harming others in ways that would kill them or haunt them. And this time, he was asking all the creatures of his forest to help him, just like in the story. But in the end, it would be him doing it. And I’d given him the book to finish it. Maybe he knew there was a copy left in an evidence lockup. Maybe that’s why he asked for me to begin with – he knew I could get to it.

The chanted words were nonsense. But at the end of the story, there was a sound I’ll never forget. In unison, they coughed out;

*“Eo. Eo. Eo.”*

 

Herman took out a single matchstick from the back of his mouth. He dropped it in the middle of the book circle. Then he joined the others. And with his own voice, for the first time, he wheezed a word out.

*“Eo.”*

The matchstick caught fire. A flame spread to the nine men in a spiraling pattern, casting fluttering shadows across the walls. The smell brought me back all the way to 2002, lying next to a smoldering corpse on the bottom of an empty pool. The men didn’t scream – it was as if they were dead already. I couldn’t comprehend what kind of story the book had shown them.

 

I pulled at Herman’s arm as the flames reached us. He didn’t let go. I stomped, trying to buy some time.

“Let me go,” I wheezed. “You don’t need me! You’re *done*!”

He blinked, then looked at me. There was something in his face that I hadn’t seen. Perhaps he’d faked emotion to trick me into pursuing that book. It made sense. Pretending to be upset would just motivate me. But now, his emotions were real. A full, open-mouth smile, as larvae dripped from his lip.

“It’s done!” I repeated. “Just stop!”

He was so full of joy. The flames danced in his eyes as the alarms began to scream. There were sirens approaching outside. And with that - he let me go.

“…dank hue,” he muttered, his voice strained. “Dank hue *evy mush*.”

 

I backed away as the flames grabbed him. He didn’t look away. The smoke from the library tickled my lungs, and I burst into a sprint down the hallway. The nurse he’d beaten had been dragged out. There were trails of blood on the floor. I followed it, hoping it would lead me outside. Everything looks different in a panic. In the smoke.

I made it outside, and into pandemonium. The air was so full of moths it could be mistaken for a mist. They’d come from the gardens; ushered into the air by the sudden fire. People were screaming, waving their arms, locking themselves in their cars. Police and firefighters were struggling to make it to the front, almost running over an orderly as they struggled to see.

Mrs. Short was locked in her car in the parking lot, staring straight ahead with tear-stained eyes. We exchanged a glance as she shook her head, defeated.

It was over. All her work and hopes; gone.

I couldn’t take my car home. I had left my keys in the reception, and I couldn’t get them back until they had the fire under control. That would be hours. I ended up getting an escort from a police officer about an hour later. He was picking larvae from his uniform the whole ride, complaining about how he’d have to go through every inch of that car with a hose when this was over.

The last thing I saw of the facility was a plume of smoke blotting out the sun; like a pair of dark, dusty, wings.

 

I was dropped off at home. I walked up to my door and sighed. I didn’t have my keys, so it’d be locked. My daughter and the babysitter was home though, so it ought to be fine.

But the door was open. It shouldn’t be.

I poked the door open, listening. There was no one there. I could hear voices from upstairs. I looked into the kitchen for something to arm myself with. I didn’t have my phone, and the officer who’d dropped me off was far gone by now. I reached for my knife block, only to realize one of the knives was already gone. I settled for a smaller one. My hand rattled so bad I almost dropped it. I forced my fingers to close into a cramp-like death grip.

I crept up the stairs, holding my breath. I knew where to put my feet to avoid a creaking.

“… so he said, ‘birthdays? You still have those’? And guess what! Guess what I said!”

The voice was familiar, but unstable. Shaking. *Callahan*.

 

I opened my daughter’s bedroom door. He was sitting on the edge of the bed, holding a kitchen knife. He was looking at the closet across the room; it had been cut and beaten, but was held close. I could hear sniffling from the inside.

“He said you can’t have birthdays when you’re *old!*” Callahan rambled on. “But that’s stupid, right? Of course you can!”

I tightened my grip on the knife. I could lunge at him. Put it in his back. But something told me not to. Perhaps the tales of Friendly Foxman had affected me more than I thought.

“Callahan,” I said. “What are you doing here?”

He turned to me in wild surprise. But instead of lunging at me, he smiled from ear to ear. He got up, seemingly forgetting that he was holding a knife.

“Hey!” he said. “I was just having a conversation with your lovely daughter!”

“I need you to stop it, Callahan.”

“But you said she was great. I thought we’d get along.”

“You’re scaring them.”

His smile faded as he looked down at his knife. He looked at the closet door, covered in cuts and bruises. He shook his head, as if just realizing what was going on.

“I’m scaring them?”

“Yes.”

“Herman said it was okay.”

“It’s not,” I said. “Now drop the knife.”

He did.

 

I thought back on that moment in 2002, where I’d pointed my gun at 10-year-old Herman. I hadn’t pulled the trigger, and all the consequences that came after that decision could be traced back to me. Every prison murder. Every twisted word and half-truth. Now I had a choice again, and I couldn’t make my mind up.

“I’m sorry,” said Callahan. “I thought it was okay.”

And just like I’d done all those years ago, I let go. I took him downstairs. I hugged my daughter and had the babysitter call the police. It didn’t take them long to come by and take Callahan into custody. They had him moved to a temporary facility, waiting for reassignment. He looked completely destroyed when they put him in the squad car. No screaming or fighting, just a quiet sobbing.

It was long after midnight when the final car left my property. I sat by my daughter as she fell asleep. I went outside, sat down on the top of the stairs, and had a long talk with my wife. She called off her business trip and took the first flight home in the morning.

 

When all was said and done, I looked at the forest across the yard. The swaying trees, singing along with the evening wind. Perhaps I was the same person now as I’d been back then. Despite the innumerable horrors and twisted words. Maybe I was still the person who couldn’t pull the trigger if push came to shove. But was it because I was a coward, or because I believed in people? Did it matter?

As I got up to head to bed, I noticed something on the driveway. Something metallic.

It was my things from the reception. My service weapon. My wallet. My keys. They were a bit ashen, but they were mine. Nothing was missing. I looked up. I called out, but there was no one there. Just the flutter of something small by the treeline.

Herman could’ve killed me back in the library. He held me, waiting for the flames. But he’d had no reason to be mean anymore. His magic lantern was lit, and perhaps that was all he really cared for. Maybe that’s why he let me go.

Looking back at this, I think I know what kind of man I want to be. I want to be the one who can imagine a light in anyone’s darkness. In Mrs. Short. In Callahan. And, perhaps, in a Moth Boy.

They never found his body. The facility never got rid of the moths. Some claim that they saw Herman leaving in the company of a man. Others said they saw him burn to death in that library. And some claim to have seen him, years later, out and about as a free man. He was easy to spot in a crowd.

 

Personally, I haven’t seen or heard from him since. But every now and then, I hear the flutter of a moth, and I look to the sky.

And if I look *really* hard, I can almost see two dusty wings.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Burt's Bees toothpaste line offers several key features designed to promote oral health while adhering to the brand's commitment to natural ingredients.

**Fluoride Options:** Some Burt's Bees toothpaste formulations include fluoride, a well-known ingredient for preventing tooth decay.

These fluoride options provide the benefits of traditional toothpaste while maintaining the brand's focus on natural ingredients. Fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria and sugars in the mouth. This is particularly beneficial for individuals prone to cavities or those with weakened enamel.

**Fluoride-Free Options:** For consumers who prefer to avoid fluoride, Burt's Bees offers fluoride-free toothpaste alternatives.

These fluoride-free options rely on other natural ingredients to clean teeth and freshen breath. These formulations often contain ingredients like xylitol, a natural sweetener that helps prevent bacteria from sticking to teeth, reducing the risk of plaque formation and cavities.

**Naturally-Sourced Ingredients:** Burt's Bees toothpaste is formulated with a high percentage of naturally-sourced ingredients.

These ingredients include plant-based cleansers, natural sweeteners, and essential oils for flavor. The brand emphasizes avoiding artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives, making their toothpaste a more natural option compared to conventional brands that often use synthetic additives.

**Whitening Properties:** Certain Burt's Bees toothpaste variants offer whitening benefits.

These whitening toothpastes use gentle abrasives and natural enzymes to help remove surface stains and brighten teeth. These formulations are designed to be less abrasive than traditional whitening toothpastes, reducing the risk of enamel damage while still effectively removing stains from coffee, tea, and other foods.

**Sensitivity Relief:** Burt's Bees also offers toothpaste specifically formulated for individuals with sensitive teeth.

These sensitivity relief toothpastes contain ingredients like potassium nitrate, which helps soothe nerve endings and reduce sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet stimuli. These formulations provide relief from discomfort while still cleaning teeth and promoting overall oral health.

**Packaging and Sustainability:** Burt's Bees is committed to sustainable packaging practices.

Their toothpaste tubes are often made from recyclable materials, and the brand is continuously exploring ways to reduce their environmental impact. This commitment to sustainability aligns with the values of many consumers who are looking for eco-friendly oral care options.

 ## Core Benefits

Burt's Bees toothpaste offers several practical benefits that make it a compelling choice for consumers seeking a natural and effective oral care solution.

**Gentle Cleaning:** The naturally-sourced ingredients in Burt's Bees toothpaste provide effective cleaning without harsh chemicals that can irritate gums or damage enamel. Users report a fresh, clean feeling without the burning sensation sometimes associated with conventional toothpaste.

**Reduced Sensitivity:** The sensitivity relief formulations help alleviate discomfort for individuals with sensitive teeth. Many users experience noticeable relief from pain when consuming hot or cold foods and beverages, allowing them to enjoy their favorite treats without discomfort.

**Natural Whitening:** The whitening toothpaste options gently remove surface stains, leading to a brighter smile without the use of harsh bleaching agents. This gradual whitening process is less likely to cause sensitivity compared to traditional whitening treatments.

**Fresh Breath:** Burt's Bees toothpaste is formulated with natural flavors and essential oils that provide long-lasting fresh breath. The absence of artificial sweeteners and flavors contributes to a more natural and pleasant taste experience.

**Peace of Mind:** Knowing that Burt's Bees toothpaste is made with naturally-sourced ingredients and without artificial additives provides peace of mind for health-conscious consumers. This transparency in ingredients and commitment to sustainability aligns with the values of many individuals seeking natural and ethical products.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is Burt's Bees toothpaste safe for children?**
  Some Burt's Bees toothpaste formulations are specifically designed for children and are safe for use under parental supervision. It's important to choose a toothpaste with an appropriate fluoride level for the child's age, or a fluoride-free option if preferred. Always consult with a dentist or pediatrician for specific recommendations.

**Can Burt's Bees toothpaste help with gum health?**
  While Burt's Bees toothpaste is not specifically formulated to treat gum disease, maintaining good oral hygiene with regular brushing can contribute to overall gum health. Some formulations contain ingredients that help reduce plaque and bacteria, which can help prevent gingivitis.

**Does Burt's Bees toothpaste contain SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate)?**
  Burt's Bees toothpaste does not contain SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate). SLS is a common foaming agent found in many conventional toothpastes, but some individuals may experience irritation from it. Burt's Bees uses alternative, naturally-derived foaming agents to provide a similar cleaning experience without the potential for irritation.

**How often should I use Burt's Bees toothpaste?**
  It is recommended to brush your teeth with Burt's Bees toothpaste twice a day, or as directed by your dentist. Regular brushing helps remove plaque and bacteria, preventing cavities and promoting overall oral health.

I’m a 35-year-old nerdy guy from New England, big into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site that made it on the news. (Yes, seriously.)

I’ve been fortunate to find community through cosplay—whether I’m suited up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil—and even got featured on the news a couple times for it. I work out, dress sharp, and have a bizarre talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes.

Now for the honest bit: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want love, but because timing, shyness, and life just never lined up. But I’ve grown a lot—and I’m ready to meet someone for something real. If you’re nerdy, kind, curious, and value connection over perfection, we might vibe well.

Cosplay’s totally optional—what matters more is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where it leads. If you’re nearby, a casual coffee would be a great way to start.

When I’m not suiting up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil, I enjoy dressing sharp, working out, and entering sweepstakes (weirdly good at winning them). I’ve been featured on the news for my fandom, and I’m passionate about creating fun, authentic connections—romantic or otherwise.

Ideally, I’d love to meet a woman who’s nerdy in her own way, emotionally available, and open to building something real. Cosplay is totally optional—I just want someone who enjoys shared adventures, mutual support, and maybe even some travel.

If you’re nearby, coffee could be a great way to start. If not, I’m open to long-distance for the right vibe. Also, I can’t post my dating site here (Reddit rules), but it’s in my profile if you’re curious!

I 20F came back from a trip to Canada. After a week, week and a half I started having constipation and the constant urge to defecate. Thought I had maybe caught a bug. Took some laxatives, did nothing. Proceeded to try all the ones as follows after directed from my primary:

Mirilax (oral and suposatory)
Fleet enema (both mineral and saline)
Prune juice
Castor oil
Kombucha
Cabbage/ Saukraut
Magnesium Citrate 
Senna S
Glycerin supposatories
Lactulose
Coffee 
New bowel routine (drinking warm tea/ coffee/ water when I wake up and waiting a little before going to the toilet to sit there)

During this time I was also taking fiber supplements and drinking around 64-96 oz of water 

After doing this for around 2 weeks my head got extremely foggy and my stool never left 1 on the Bristol stool scale. I didn’t want to become dependent on laxatives so I stopped thinking It was a blockage. 

Had an X-Ray done and no issues no blockage as i was producing a single small quarter sized ball of excrement each morning. Few days later I lost my appetite and was extremely nauseous and bloated. I felt weak and faint so I went into the ER where I had my blood tested and CT done both came back normal. Although they said there was more irregular sounds and ‘movement’

It’s been around a week and a half since the ER visit and I haven’t felt hungry at all. I still feel bloated and the head fog is like I’m walking in a dream. Im very nauseous and I feel much gassier than normal. I feel tight in my lower abdomen with a burning discomfort in the center of my torso.

My normal diet is pretty whole foods oriented and I’m no stranger to kombucha and sauerkraut as my mother has a food allergy and everything is generally very clean organic and not processed. 

I usually walk 5-9k steps a day but with how foggy I’ve been feeling and the lack of nutrients I’ve been getting in I haven’t had much motivation to get  more than 2k

I have a meeting with a gastro in a week or so and I know I want to ask a few things, like testing for SIBO but does anyone have any idea what else this could be or what I should be doing?

i am considering one of the following 3:

- airpods max
- sony ch720
- soundcore q30

answers to the sub requirements:

> Budget and location - How much would you like to spend? What are some local or online shops in your country?

i have no budget, obviously the cheaper the better but i'm willing to dish out the $ for the apm's if i will love them and they will last a long time. i'd be grabbing these headphones from amazon canada.

> Preferred tonal balance - Are you a bass-head, focused on accuracy, looking for sparkly treble, or wide soundstage

bass-head. i don't care about accuracy, i want a solid rumble.

> How the gear will be used -Use at home, on the go, in an office?

mainly used when working on my macbook. maybe sometimes for travel, meetings, or taken to a coffee shop.

> Past gear experience - What did you like about it and what didn't you like about it?

i've tried all of the 3 i'm considering in the past and here are my observations / experiences:

- apm - love the apple ecosystem integration and the ear/head detection. i tried these when they first came out years ago and couldn't figure out how to disable the ANC so i returned them lmao. also because they were a bit tight (as with my big ears, i have a big head).

- ch720 - these were the most comfortable i tried on in the store when comparing them to JBL's and skullcandy's (neither even fit my head). i also compared them to super expensive sony XM's etc and still preferred the feel of the 720's. i have had some budget sony's in the past and don't mind the default sound profile. i like how you can eq them in the sony app. the only thing i really dislike is that they don't fold (yes i realize the apms dont fold either, but the apms are much nicer aesthetically and build-wise)

- q30 - i've had these briefly and in terms of comfort, sound, and price, im really leaning towards these. i only returned them because they made my ears hot but i'm starting to realize theres tradeoffs for everything, and if slightly warm ears are the only downside then i think these might be my best bet.

That’ll be out in a bit. Thanks.

\[steaming milk\]

Yeah. Here. Next, we got two hot lattes, one with oat, one with almond, an iced lavender latte with oat, and a- Honeycomb. Iced with soy. 

Honey and cinnamon do sound nice together. I really wish I could mix stuff like this. If only it all didn’t become lumpy in the end from mixing different blo- liquids. Wow, the latte art is so clean. You made it look so easy. I remember seeing a swan online, can you do that?

Huh. Maybe one day.

\[counter bell ring\]

How many milks do you need again? Two whole, three oat, one almond, and one soy? Two almond, got it.

\[walking, then walking back\] 

Behind. I said behind- 

\[thud, milk cartons falling\] 

Oh come on, move. I said I was behind you. 

I *was* carrying all of them until someone didn’t move.

\[counter bell ring\]

Last call for iced latte with almond. 

\[counter bell ring, again\] 

Matcha- I said matcha. Not mocha.

\[counter bell ring, again.\]

Why do these sharpies keep running out?!

\[counter bell ring, of course.\]

Finally, I thought they would never leave. All that only took us about 3 hours. It felt like it would never end. Just because there’s no line doesn’t mean we’re not busy with other cups.

Nah, this is easy. I could see how it’s difficult for you though. 

\[laughing\]

Not my fault you fall for it every time. Even a light breeze could tick you off. 

…Rage, baiting? That’s a new one. So what’s the bait, you or the rage?

Shut up, I’m not that old. So, now that we’re alone, how about we take a look at that security footage?

Cameras can get proof if someone enters. I doubt that a vampire would want to rob a cafe too. 

Don’t call me slow. You said the machine was pulling bad shots. I was waiting on you for that couple’s drinks. Oh, you know that one person sitting next to them? They kept looking at me, even tipped a 20. Jealous?

Hm. I told them before that I don’t work here so it’s not mine. I still want my thanks for my unpaid labor by the way. I need a little more compared to last time. Later though. I don’t want to drink from you while there’s still sweat beading down your neck. Can we finally look through the footage or what?

Thank you.

\[walking\]

\[door opening and closing\]

Break room? No, this is a hallway. At least you can fit a small computer in the corner. I think I remember this model. Y2K was literally yesterday. Well, for me. 

\[typing\]

Isn’t it kind of funny how this looks like a horror movie? Think about it. A human with the faint light of a dying computer on their face. The camera slowly pans to a vampire in the darkness looking at them… A quick shot of my fangs.

Me? Trying to scare you? I’m not even trying right now. Kinda cute you think that though.

\[bell outside ringing\]

You have got to be joking. Go check it out, scream if there’s anything.

\[walking out\]

\[phone ringing, but faintly in the break room. Sounds that are normal are now a source of fear, like a door opening or a refrigerator humming growing louder. Audio is muffled by the walls and other noises as Red walks around.\]

Rove?! Rove, where are you? It’s been days! Are you alright, what the-

You scared the daylight out of me! Just tell me where you are, and I’ll-

Stop thinking with your gut for once and use your brain. You’re going to be okay, where are you? …Rove? Shit. 

\[muffled footsteps going out\]

Red? Red, snap out of it! Hey!

Are you good? You’re probably exhausted from working. Come on. Sit down.

\[footsteps back into the break room\]

I said, sit down.

\[placing hand on shoulder, immediate pull back\]

What was that for?

Don’t “huh” me, you flinched when I put my hand on your shoulder.

Yeah, you did…I’m not gonna randomly bite you, you know. I’m a monster, but not *that* kind. 

I’m allowed to call myself that. I’m not going to tell you that you can’t call yourself human if you’re evil. Labels always make everything more complicated. You can only reduce yourself down so much that one word won’t describe you entirely. You only end up back where you started. Look. You shut your eyes and I’ll look through the footage. You look more dead than me. 

What else am I going to do with some old tapes, burn it? I need it. Since when did you get so defensive?

…Go to sleep Red. You need it.

\[clicking and typing\]

At least this is something I can manage. Dumbass manager can’t even get a couch in here. I don’t know how you live like this. Only brewing caffeine for paper that would be meaningless on another planet. You don’t even get total peace of mind once you do. Guess that’s one thing we share. Always needing more.

\[fade out and fade in on typing\]

Hey. Still feeling wonky?

That’s something. Okay. I just kept looking through the footage. I wrote down the possible days and times that could align with when they were here.

You want to look through? Yeah, here.

\[clicking, pause before clicking again\]

That’s them? 

What’s wrong?

Yeah, I see the space next to them. 

What? Hey. Breathe. Look at me. 

Wait. Hold on. Someone else might have been with them? That could have just been empty space next to them in the group. 

If you’re not sure, then maybe there wasn’t. Rove went out by themself. I… I think?

How can you be sure of that? You could be misremembering, you just woke up. What did the other person look like?

Okay, understandable. You can’t remember everyone.

The receipts? 

That makes sense… it’s not an exact recording system, but there’s no way it would erase an order if a vampire got a drink. Maybe they got one just to keep up the act. But why would Rove- whatever. We got something at least. Hope it doesn’t lead us anywhere worse.

No electrician required; they’re battery powered and install on standard doors.

**Heads-up deal:** Back-to-School promo — **20% off sitewide** with code **BTS20**, **Aug. 5–18**.

# What DESLOC gets right

* **Multiple ways to get in:** keypad codes, app control, fingerprint on certain models, and a manual key. If Wi-Fi drops, local codes still work.
* **Temporary & recurring codes:** set time windows for guests, cleaners, dog walkers, or contractors. Codes can auto-expire so you’re not chasing people later.
* **Remote management (with gateway):** check door status, lock or open it from the app, and change codes without driving across town.
* **Hardware choices:** deadbolt-only or lever-with-deadbolt kits so you can match what’s already on the door.
* **Quick setup:** most installs take about the time of a coffee break. Handed for left/right doors and includes a strike plate—just make sure your deadbolt hole is drilled straight and the door closes smoothly.

# Real-world use cases

# Vacation rentals (Airbnb/VRBO)

* **Self check-in that actually works:** send a unique code that starts at 4 p.m. on arrival day and stops at 11 a.m. on departure day. No key box, no spare under the mat.
* **Cleaner & maintenance access:** create weekday codes (e.g., Tue/Thu 10 a.m.–2 p.m.). If a turnover runs long, extend the window from your phone.
* **Audit trail for disputes:** see when the door was opened. Helpful if there’s a question about late checkout or early entry.
* **Last-minute bookings:** guest books at 7 p.m.? Issue a code in 30 seconds—no drive-by key handoff.
* **Multi-door properties:** front door, garage entry, owner’s closet—give different codes/permissions to each.

# Long-term rentals & property managers

* **Key control without the key closet:** unique codes for prospects, vendors, and new tenants. Disable the moment a lease ends.
* **Unit turns:** one “make-ready” code for your crew across the week, then retire it.
* **Common areas:** keypad access for laundry rooms or gyms without rekeying the building.

# Families and roommates

* **No more “I forgot my keys”:** kids get their own codes; you get alerts when they’re home.
* **Temporary codes for guests:** in-laws visiting? Weekend-only code, then it vanishes.
* **Elder care:** fingerprint or simple PIN beats fumbling with keys.

# Home services & deliveries

* **Contractors:** code active only during the service window. If they’re running late, extend it remotely.
* **Package safety:** set a one-time code for in-garage or entry drop-offs (if you’re comfortable with that).

# Small offices & studios

* **Open/close schedules:** codes that only work during business hours.
* **Staff changes:** remove access without rekeying the whole place.

# Setup tips that save headaches

* **Decide on the gateway:** If you want true remote control and real-time alerts, add the G2 gateway. If you only need local pin codes, you can skip it.
* **Use code naming rules:** e.g., first-initial + last-4 of phone. It keeps things tidy.
* **Keep a physical backup key somewhere safe:** batteries last a long time, but they are still batteries.
* **Rotate guest codes:** don’t recycle the same code season after season.
* **Document your playbook:** template your guest message: code, start time, how to open/close, who to call, and a note that entry times are logged.

# Security notes (straight talk)

* **Set an admin passcode in the app and enable notifications.** If the account is shared, use separate profiles where possible.
* **Turn off default/master codes.** Only keep the ones you actually use.
* **Use codes for guests—not fingerprints.** Reserve biometrics for household members.
* **Fit matters:** a misaligned strike plate causes “it won’t latch” complaints. Take 5 minutes to adjust before you hand it to a renter.

# Who [will like DESLOC](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/deslocevergreen?cid=desloc20pctoffaug25_rddt)

* **Hosts and property managers** who want hands-off check-ins.
* **Parents** who are done being the on-call locksmith.
* **Small teams** needing simple access control without a full badge system.

If you’re shopping, look at the **B200 series** for fingerprint + lever options and the **C110** for a budget-friendly keypad. Add the **G2 gateway** if you need remote control and alerts.

Once you finish school and move out from home, get your first own place and new Job, you would think that finally something has to change for the better, right?

Earlier than my set alarm. A silent morning where I can only hear animal noises. Just the usual routine: emails, coffee, check up on people. Scheduled what I have to do today. It's quite a lot but I can do it. The sun hit my skin through the window, seemingly charging me a little more than the coffee. It wasn't bliss, I just don't feel sluggish this morning.

I do things a little old school. I tend to write on notebook what I have to do. Something about physically crossing out a task feels good. As I was checking out the time, I noticed the date today: August 16. A day before one my best friend's birthday. But more importantly, the day I publicly crashed out for the first time in my life. 

I still remember that day back in 2012. It was humid but I was still wearing a jacket over my school uniform. It was a Uniqlo cream jacket I bought around a week prior. It's actually my first Uniqlo clothing ever. I even saw Ramon Bautista when I bought it. Was too shy to ask for photo though and my phone back then was crappy that it didn't have front camera. 

My asshat classmates have been harassing me for around 2 weeks by that time. ""Don't mind them"" I said to myself. I haven't done anything other than being an artistic silent guy. Apes gonna be apes, I guess. We were at Philippine History class, waiting for the professor to arrive. The apes were noisy as usual. I didn't really mind. Then later they were touching my stuff. I hated it. I politely interacted with them and telling them to stop. But they keep provoking and provoking. A seatmate of mine, a scholar from Bicol, told me to calm down. I tried to. I told my seatmate ""yeah, I have no time for those low lives"". Non-verabatim, of course because that would be edgy evend by 2012 standards. Suddenly, something in my head literally snapped. I removed my glasses and gently put it on my arm chair. I stood up while they're still provoking with ""ohhhhhhhh"". I carried an arm chair, lifted it and wanted to throw it on their head honcho's face. My weird logical thought purposely made me miss just few centimeters. As I throw, I screamed the loudest ""putang ina"" is my whole life so far. It was louder than when I shout during martial arts competitions. A loud roar that it managed to shut everyone up even the next rooms. Made one of classmates that wasn't involved ran out of the room. The head honcho's friends and I guess second dog tried to calm me down but I wasn't having it. I kicked his arm and the asshole had the audacity to get mad.

Everything calmed down when the professor arrived. He's a good dude but of course tried to be neutral. Man, I remember it so vividly. It's not a fond memory, though. 

13 years later and I just realized how different I have become along the way. All those journey years after may not have been a total waste. I did pretty good with what I was working with. I love my parents with all my heart and but it really wasn't an emotional bonding household. Or at least, they're not as affectionate the way I am. Being affectionate, caring, and just warm light is some sort of miracle. It did really took me a long way. Have I always been warm light that got dim or was I dim light that got bright and warmer? I don't know but I'm just happy I evolved.

## Key Features Analysis

The best bamboo cups of 2025 offer a range of features that set them apart from generic options.These features contribute to their durability, functionality, and overall appeal.

**Material and Construction:** High-quality bamboo cups are typically made from sustainably sourced bamboo fibers combined with a food-grade resin binder. The best cups feature a double-walled construction for insulation, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for extended periods. A durable and leak-proof lid, often made from bamboo or silicone, is essential for preventing spills.

The Material used in these cups shoudl be free from BPA and other harmful chemicals,ensuring that your beverages remain safe and uncontaminated. The construction process should prioritize durability to withstand daily use and washing, extending the lifespan of the cup. A well-constructed cup minimises the risk of cracking or leaking, providing a reliable and long-lasting solution.

**Insulation Performance:** Effective insulation is a crucial feature for any reusable cup. Bamboo cups vary in their insulation capabilities, with some models offering superior thermal performance.Cups with double-walled vacuum insulation can maintain beverage temperatures for several hours.

The Double-walled design creates an air gap between the inner and outer layers, reducing heat transfer and keeping your drinks at the desired temperature. Improved Insulation means that hot drinks stay warmer for longer, and cold drinks remain chilled without excessive condensation on the exterior. This insulation performance is notably beneficial for commuters, travelers, or anyone who wants to enjoy their beverages at the optimal temperature throughout the day.

**Lid Design and Functionality:** The lid is an essential component of a bamboo cup, contributing to its spill-resistance and overall usability. A well-designed lid should fit snugly and securely, preventing leaks while allowing for easy drinking.

Many high-quality Bamboo cups Feature a silicone seal to enhance leak-proof performance further.Some lids also include a sliding or rotating closure to open and close the drinking hole easily. A wide mouth opening on the lid facilitates easy sipping and cleaning. The lid material should be chosen for durability and safety, with BPA-free plastic or bamboo being common options.

**Capacity and Portability:** Bamboo cups come in a variety of sizes to suit diffrent preferences and needs. Common capacities range from 12 ounces to 20 ounces, offering options for both smaller and larger beverages.

The overall Portability of the cup is also an important consideration. A cup that fits comfortably in standard cup holders and is lightweight enough to carry easily is ideal for on-the-go use. Ergonomic designs, such as tapered shapes or textured grips, can enhance comfort and ease of handling.

Key features of top-rated bamboo cups include:

* Double-walled insulation
* Leak-proof lid with silicone seal
* Sustainable bamboo construction
* BPA-free materials

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about bamboo cups before making a purchase. Addressing these concerns can help them make informed decisions and choose the right cup for their needs.

**Are bamboo cups dishwasher safe?**
While some bamboo cups might potentially be labeled as dishwasher safe, hand washing is generally recommended to prolong their lifespan. The high heat and harsh detergents in dishwashers can damage the bamboo fibers and affect the integrity of the cup.Hand washing with mild soap and warm water is the gentlest way to clean your bamboo cup and maintain its quality.

**How long do bamboo cups last?**
With proper care, a high-quality bamboo cup can last for several years. Factors such as frequency of use, washing methods, and exposure to extreme temperatures can affect its lifespan. Avoiding harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can definitely help extend the life of your bamboo cup. Regular maintenance, such as oiling the bamboo to prevent drying and cracking, can also contribute to its longevity.**Can bamboo cups be used for hot and cold drinks?**
Yes, bamboo cups are suitable for both hot and cold beverages. The double-walled insulation helps maintain the temperature of the drink and prevents excessive condensation on the exterior of the cup. Though, itS essential to avoid extreme temperature fluctuations, such as pouring boiling water into a cold cup, as this could perhaps cause damage.

**Are bamboo cups recyclable?**
while bamboo is a biodegradable material,bamboo cups are not always easily recyclable due to the resin binders used in their construction. However, some manufacturers offer recycling programs or compostable options for their bamboo cups. check with the manufacturer or your local recycling center to determine the best disposal method for your specific bamboo cup.

1mreukj,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1mreukj/accused_of_maybe_perceptions/,Accused of maybe perceptions...,"Hi all, 


My farily new direct supervisor (they) came up to me and separately with another coworker. They accused us of risking giving off the perception of an inappropriate relationship. Essentially, vibes because we get along very well. They went down a list of their perceptions while claiming we did nothing wrong and should keep doing what im doing.. but they will make a formal complaint if they get the same perceptions vibe. 

I feel highly disrespected and confused of what the hell they is talking about. My colleague felt the same way. 


The coworker is a brand new college summer intern, I am mid level lead for my portfolio. I was tasked to train the intern. Our line of work is 80% doubled up in a cubicle doing research and writing publication the rest giving presentations. We get lunch or coffee in the building on occasion that we eat at our desks separately or walk out at the same time since we take the same work bus. We are the sole two people on the portfolio and thus all work is on our two person team to accomplish. Since the intern is brand new, I have had them lead each project with direct oversigh due to the sensitivity of the work. When I was new or anyone else, we are tied to the hip of the lead for the first 3-6m depending on capability. Probably obvious, im male, the intern in female. 

I did my due diligence and got written feed back from coworkers who all sit within a 10m cubicle space as us and are pricy to nearly 100% of all conversations. I asked a female lead to speak with the intern and get their POV just in case I was doing something wrong. I reported to my other direct supervisor who will be speaking with they's supervisor. No one reported bad behavior or anything that could be seen as inappropriate. 

Some of the things they said were flat out alarming and accusatory without any evidence or things to cite other than ""pattern of behavior."" That being: you walk to close, you all laugh to much, you all are always together (required for the job and tasked to do it that way), intern said an animal was cute and that could be seen as talking about appearances. Like, a whole bunch of nothing to come at me with this nonsense. 

Bright side, sup bosses bos gave major thank you/good job for being a higher performer and being a great lead/example set for the intern. 

Im frankly livid at this non-accusation, accusation and how that will impact the interns decision to come on board the next year. I truly give a dam about my work and giving a good example to the intern that I did not get when in a similar position as an intern years ago. 


Am I in the wrong for being pissed?

1mrett1,https://www.reddit.com/r/theravada/comments/1mrett1/livin_for_the_weekend/,Livin' for the Weekend,"For maybe a decade, I’ve stoically (sometimes sullenly) made my way through the week, just waiting for *Friday Night*. I would clock out, hit the grocery store to buy some veggie nuggets or a couple Impossible burgers, and on the way out grab a half-dozen beers- “Because if you’re going to cut loose a little, you may as well cut loose a little more.” I would get home, play computer games until after dark, then start cracking open the beers, one after another. 

I don’t normally have early morning responsibilities on the weekends, so I could sleep it off if I overindulged. If I were in the company of friends, I generally would not speak unskillfully, and if I were alone, I generally would not think unskillful thoughts- but they would still creep in from time to time. A witty insult to a friend that I couldn’t resist saying or some errant thought about how I had been wronged in the past and should have gotten revenge.

When I would start losing to the enemies in Elden Ring or I became a liability for my team in League of Legends, I would call it a night. No vomiting, no blacking out. I would wake up the next day satisfied. I got to enjoy my reward. My night off. Just under a week until *Next Friday*.

A few months ago, I finally saw the truth with enough clarity to give up the vice of intoxicants completely. I confronted the reality that I was eschewing freedom in favor of bondage to the buzz, so the booze had to go. In retrospect, drinking is really a quite unwise behavior. 

Friday Night stayed, though. I eat pretty healthy through the week, and I have responsibilities to deal with, and now I don’t even drink, so I need a night to recuperate now more than ever. Fast forward through a few months of veggie wings with the hottest wing sauce Kroger sells and getting destroyed in Hunt: Showdown or maybe some other game that was on sale. 

Something did change after I quit drinking, though - something unexpected. A thought has been entering my mind sometimes when I’m about to indulge in something unnecessary: *Will this really lead to my happiness?* If I buy this game, *will I finally be free?* *Will I be laying down the burden* by watching YouTube for two hours?

It’s not yet a consistent behavior, but more and more often, I ask myself if I really need the things that I think that I do. No, the 64 oz. Coke Zero with vanilla syrup at the gas station *won’t* bring me lasting welfare and happiness. Sometimes I won't heed the thought; I’ll talk myself right into the extra large coffee from Tim Hortons, despite knowing that it doesn’t serve my interests. At times I seem to rally against these thoughts. The coffee won't serve me, *but I just don't care.*

Whether or not I practice sense restraint in the moment, one practice I have developed is carefully investigating the consequences of those intentions. If I pay attention just long enough to see where these choices lead, then I might learn more about which choices I should make.

As it turns out, that coffee I couldn’t resist was… alright. Definitely not worth compromising over, but good enough that I’ll crave it again. That video game I wanted- I don’t even remember what game it was anymore. I’m not suffering without it. I’m actually a little happier now that I’m not burdened with another thing to do.

If I personally see that certain actions lead to certain results, then it seem wise that I act in service to those results which are beneficial. If I see that I am happier without the soda, then I won’t want the soda next time it crosses my mind either. If Timmy Ho’s coffee didn’t deliver on the promise of satisfaction that I made, then next time, maybe I’ll attend more wisely to that choice.

Earlier this week, I was contemplating my anticipated weekend shenanigans, when something happened. Something both unwelcome and all but inevitable.

*Friday Night won’t deliver me from suffering, will it?* 

It’s a persistent realization that I’ve contemplated all week. Whenever thoughts of escape- thoughts of the future- intruded on my attendance to the present moment, that thought would accompany it: *It won’t work this time, either.* 

And I think the thought is right. There’s only one way to know, though. I’ll look, and see for myself.

This behavior isn’t leading to asceticism- I’m not systematically taking away all the things I love. This isn’t a symptom of depression. I think that skillful behaviors have created the causes and conditions for this thought to arise. I’ll heed it, and observe the outcome.

Anyway, I’ve got an early night tonight.

1mret0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1mret0b/just_hang_in_there/,Just hang in there,"Hi, everyone. It’s been almost a year since I developed tinnitus. It’s been a rough ride, but it DOES get better. But this is just my experience, and for the people who comment here to “tough it up” or how its all in your head, well, yeah. It’s a NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION. It IS going to affect your mental health, it goes hand in hand. But it is NOT the solitary cause of tinnitus. Tinnitus is a complex condition, and I still encourage you to constantly find and rule out causes of not a more severe condition. The best advice I got here is that sudden tinnitus from acoustic trauma is like a broken leg. You’re gonna need time to heal, and you DEFINITELY don’t need to push it through and expose yourself to louder sounds. You need to lessen exposure and need time to take care of yourself and heal. Do not listen to people here who claim it’s just anxiety, because they would not be the ones paying for your medical bills if they end up being wrong.

 

Anyways, from taking a couple of medical tests, it seems so far that I got mine at a music nightclub. Stupidly I did not wear earplugs, I should’ve at least rolled some toilet paper and plugged it into my ears. While I was at the performance, the speaker blew out, and I honestly think that’s what caused it. Well, around three weeks later, I was eating in a restaurant, and someones cellphone rang. That’s when I heard the tinnitus kick in. Usually it fades, I used to get it and it would just randomly happen.  But, yeah, this time it didn’t go away. It was the dreaded EEEEEE tone, the same shit you’d hear when playing call of duty and a explosion would go off. That same night I did not sleep. I went to the er hospital with them saying I needed to make an appointment with an ent and they could not give me anything.

 Every time I would exhaust myself to sleep my body would jerk me up and I would wake up shaking with adrenaline. I swear I thought I was gonna go crazy and be like one of those homeless walking around the streets. I would eventually fall asleep with exhaustion, only to be waken up again. The weird thing is that I started hearing explosions, like gunshots right when I was about to fall asleep. Every night I would only get like 45 min, to an 1:45, to 2, and eventually 4 hours. But the noise was there 24/7, and It was like a 7-8. It ws the first time I had thoughts of ending it all, just to make it go away. Like I knew I wasn’t going to, but I wanted relief so bad. The crazy thing is that I still had to go to work. After like three weeks, it went down to a 4, but it was still there. I avoided coffee, because it would push it up to like a 6 again. But yeah, mentally I wasn’t all there. I developed hyperacusis, and I would hear the ringing get louder with louder noises. I started to wear ear plugs everywhere all day.

Every night I eventually started to fall sleep a total of 6 hours, just broken up in pieces. I didn’t feel mentally the same like I used to be. I started thinking that maybe I would develop dementia. But 3 months later, weirdly enough, I started to notice I wouldn’t wake up shaking that much anymore. By the 6 month mark, I started to fall asleep more soundly.

 

Looking back I should’ve taken a 3 month leave to heal, because I was definitely NOT in good mental state. Honestly I don’t know how I got through it,but I just had to. Now, the ringing went down to like a background hiss, like what an old crt tv used to make when you would just turn it on and it would make that faint ringing hum. After a year, Im back to my normal self, I can fall asleep fully again, and now my mind ignores the hum. I didn’t work out, I did eat more healthy though, but during that period, I really realized who my friends were. There were some who just waved me away, saying it was all in my head. Yeah, I cut them off for good. There were a few who did support me through this, and now I’m glad things ended up the way it did.

Anyways, now I notice its hard to hear a bit on one side of the ear. My hyperacusis went down, it still there but not as pronounced as it used to be. I no longer wear earplugs, the noises aren’t as sensitive as they used to be, but I still have some loops earbuds with me if I ever go out to a bar or a loud environment. I still haven’t gone to a movie theatre or to a concert. I honestly don’t know if I eventually would, but considering I’m back to being my original mental state, I really don’t want to risk. The good thing? Now it went down to a one and a half, and I only hear it if I’m in my car or if I’m in a quiet room.

For the tdlr version, yes I got tinnitus. And for those similar in my situation, hang in there. It DOES get better. If you guys ever need someone to talk to, just shoot me a dm.",3,1755302392.0,tinnitus,3,0.8,False

Hanggang hinahatid niya na ako sa work (though mini-meet ko lang siya sa sakayan) if may time siya kasi MWF lang daw pasok niya. Then I asked for his socials, ang sabi niya ""Wala akong social media kasi toxic lang do'n and busy ako sa work talaga."" sabi ko naman ""huh? ano mode of communication niyo ng friends mo?"" sa Viber daw; naniwala ako kasi okay, doctor, professional. Na-feel ko rin na wow he's into me kasi palaging update siya kapag galing work, magsend ng pic kapag nasa bahay na, hinahanap ako kapag matagal magreply, binibigyan ng chocolates.

Papunta kami sa work and nagkuwento siya na mahirap daw buhay nila before, kaya raw siya nakapag-aral ng MD kasi parang sumasama siya na maghelp sa mga secluded areas no'ng starting pa raw sya, check up daw, or diagnose, 5k per patient and so on, very maramdamin ang naging kuwento niya. Na-appreciate ko rin na naga-update siya and magsend ng nasa hospital and marami patients; nag-update rin siya before na meeting with different doctors and nasa LED screen na may hospital something. Nawala na doubt ko na doctor talaga siya kasi may proof na talaga.

One time, hindi dapat ako sasama sa mga friends ko kasi may labas dapat kami ni ""D"" after work ko (late night pero napag-usapan na mag ice cream lang for an hour), hindi na ako sinasagot hangga't sa out ko na, sinundo nalang ako ng friends ko and no'ng 2 AM na, nagmessage na nakatulog daw siya. Okay sige kasama ko friends ko sabi ko, nagalit siya kasi bakit daw sabi ko raw hindi ako puwedeng late sa labas na kasama siya pero bakit 2 AM na nasa labas pa rin ako? Aba siyempre friends ko sila kako at nagalit siya. Pero nagkaayos din naman kami the next day.

May one time rin na nagcommit siya na susunduin ako sa coffee shop kasi I'm out with my friends. Nauna na iba kong friends na umalis pero may isa akong friend na sinamahan ako maghintay. Nagtanong siya kung may kasama pa ako sabi ko yo'ng isa kong friend ang sabi niya ""wait lang wala pa kapatid ko, wala pa sasakyan and wala kasama si mama."" naiinip na ako kasi ang tagal and nakakahiya na rin sa friend ko so nagfollow up na ako, ""Gusto mo bang iwan ko si mama na mag-isa?"" gets ko naman and sabi ko sige grab nalang ako, though in my mind sabi niya kanina he's ready to fetch me na tapos biglang gano'n. No'ng nakasakay na ako sa grab, do'n dumating ang kapatid niya and nagsorry ganito ganyan.

NSFW: May mga days na nag-oopen siya about sexual things, ano raw stand ko sa ganito ganyan, pinag-awayan pa namin na hindi ako comfortable sa ganyang usapan kako. Then dumating na ang day na nagtanong siya kung ""V"" daw ako, proud ako pa na nag-answer pa na ""yes."" There, kinwestiyon na niya ako, at my age raw bakit wala pa ako experience? kaya raw pala parang immature pa ako. Kaya siguro raw naghiwalay kami ng ex ko no'n or parang ang tagal ko single kasi wala pa raw ako experience, dapat daw hindi na ako ""V"" kasi kailangan ng lalaki 'yon. ""Balang araw maaalala mo ako and hahanapin mo ako kasi napatunayan mong tama ako."" sabi niya TE!!! Inambahan ko rin siya ng mga facts and opinion kong hahagod sa kanya then I ended our thing and blocked him.

2 months had passed, Christmas day na, I installed my telegram dahil do'n nagsi-send ng group photos ang mga friends ko, aba biglang may message, siya. Long message talaga na kung marupok ka, bibigay ka. Blocked siya sa imessage kaya he tried reaching out sa telegram. He's sorry daw and gusto niya makipag-ayos. Hindi ko na ulit siya pinansin and nagseen lang ako.

New year, nagmessage nanaman siya and nakikipag-ayos. Kinabahan ako, naisip kong magsend ng piso sa GCASH at nilagay ko number niya. That’s the only na naisip ko kasi wala akong kahit anong personal infor niya. Grabeeeee, sobrang layo ng sinabi niyang name sa akin compare sa lumabas sa gcash niya, Dinecode ko sa isip ko ang mga asterisk, one try lang and tinry ko i-search sa Linked In, FB and IG, boom, lumabas siya.

Hindi siya doctor, wala siyang bahid ng prerequisite para maging doctor,  hindi ""D"" pangalan niya. Isa siyang businessman (‘yong drink na dinala niya, is from his shop), na ang business niya ay malapit sa hospital at may ka-live in partner siya na may business din. Nagtra-travel sila, masaya sila, living with his mother, kapatid and dogs, religious pa nga ata. The girl's family seems also well off, educated. Sa facebook, sobrang mahal na mahal nila isa't-isa.

Kaya pala ayaw lumabas kami ng may araw kasi may partner pala siya; ‘yong mga naka-meeting niya before is parang para sa website ng hospital something pala. MWF lang schedule? Doctor?

Nireplyan ko lang ng ""Ciao, GLB (his initials of his real name)!"" and blocked him again. From there, never na nagreach out. Balak pa ako gawing sidechick? Ang nakakatawa lang akala niya makukuha niya ako sa mga manipulations niya.

Sad lang ako for the girl and gusto ko siya i-message na niloloko siya, kaso mas gusto ko na tadhana nalang gagawa ng paraan. Nakakalito!

Sorry, late ko na na-realize ang mga red flags!",43,1755302355.0,adviceph,27,0.95,False

Chapter 1: Understanding Solar Power — More Than Panels on a Roof

When most people think about solar power, they picture shiny panels on a roof, soaking up sunlight to power a home. But solar energy is far more than just hardware mounted on your house. It’s about understanding the flow of energy — how it moves, when it moves, and how you can bend it to your needs. It’s a dance with the sun, the weather, your appliances, and even your lifestyle.

The True Power of Solar Is in the Timing

Solar isn’t just about collecting energy; it’s about when and how you use it. The sun doesn’t shine 24/7, and neither should your energy consumption blindly follow the clock. Learning to align your energy usage with solar production is the key to maximizing efficiency and savings.

From my experience living off-grid and carefully analyzing every watt-hour, I discovered that the “sweet spot” — the perfect window to use solar — can be precisely pinpointed. It’s not some vague daylight hours, but specific windows during the day when your panels perform optimally, and your battery system works like a well-oiled machine.

The Phantom Load: The Hidden Drain on Your Energy

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was the phantom load — an invisible drain that creeps into your meter readings and electric bills. It’s that extra power that utility companies charge you for, even when you’re not using it. Catching and documenting this phantom load became a mission because it directly affects your savings and the credibility of solar power’s promises.

I tracked this phantom load with precision — down to the tick of the meter and the seconds between each pulse. This wasn’t just about saving money; it was about exposing the system’s flaws and helping others protect themselves from similar traps.

Lifestyle Changes: The Ultimate Solar Game-Changer

Having solar panels is one thing, but adapting your lifestyle to them is where real power lies. Too many get solar installations and keep their old energy habits, missing out on huge potential savings.

When I adjusted my usage — timing showers, dishwashing, cooking, and appliance use — around solar generation and battery storage, my system ran smoother, costs dropped, and my energy independence grew.

Energy Awareness Is Freedom

Solar power taught me one vital lesson: awareness is freedom. The more you understand your home’s energy patterns, the better decisions you make. You move from being a passive consumer to an active energy manager, controlling costs, reducing waste, and living sustainably.

This book is your roadmap to that freedom. From the basics of solar hardware to the nuances of daily energy management, I’ll share everything I’ve learned — the good, the hard, and the innovative.Chapter 2: Understanding Your Energy Needs

Before you can optimize your solar system and make it work efficiently for your lifestyle, you need to understand exactly how much energy your household consumes — and when.

2.1 Tracking Your Current Usage

Start by gathering your electric bills for the past 12 months. Look for:

Total kilowatt-hours (kWh) used monthly

Peak usage times (if available)

Seasonal fluctuations


This gives you a baseline and helps identify when you use the most electricity.

2.2 Breaking Down Household Appliances

Make a list of every appliance and device you use regularly. For each, note:

Wattage (found on labels or manuals)

Average daily use (hours or minutes)


Calculate the approximate energy consumption of each:

> Energy (Wh) = Wattage × Time used (hours)



Example: A 100-watt light bulb used 5 hours/day consumes 500 Wh (0.5 kWh).

2.3 Identifying Phantom Loads

Phantom loads are energy draws from devices when they’re off but still plugged in — like chargers, smart TVs, or microwaves in standby. These can add up significantly.

Use a power meter to measure standby consumption

Unplug or use smart power strips to cut phantom loads


2.4 Recognizing Patterns

Monitor your energy use by time of day. Most homes have peak usage in mornings and evenings.

With solar, your goal is to align your highest usage with peak solar production — generally midday to afternoon — to maximize efficiency.

2.5 Lifestyle Adjustments for Solar

Solar power works best when your energy consumption adapts to its natural cycle.

Simple changes include:

Running heavy appliances (dishwasher, laundry) during daylight

Avoiding simultaneous use of multiple high-draw devices

Using energy-efficient lighting and appliances


2.6 Setting Your Energy Budget

Once you understand your energy use, set realistic goals to reduce consumption where possible.

This helps:

Downsize your solar and battery system — saving money upfront

Increase your chance of going fully off-gridChapter 3: Fine-Tuning Your Solar System and Overclocking

When it comes to running a home on solar power efficiently, understanding the nuances of your system is key. One of the biggest advantages I have with my setup is that I’ve built in some extra capacity — what I call “overclocking” the system.

Overclocking Your Solar System

In my system, I have eight panels installed, but I’m currently only using four of them — meaning four panels are sitting up on the roof not in use. This “overclocking” approach gives me options. I can easily connect those extra four panels to a separate inverter, charge controller, or grid-tie connector whenever I want to increase my power capacity. It’s like having built-in expansion ready to go whenever I need more juice, without having to install anything new later.

Safety Note: While overclocking your solar setup offers flexibility, it’s important to manage the system carefully. Ensure each charge controller and inverter is properly rated for the panels it handles, and always follow manufacturer guidelines to prevent overloading or damaging your equipment.

Managing Your Loads

To optimize energy use, you have to track your electrical loads carefully. Knowing when and how much power you use lets you schedule your heavy appliances during peak solar production hours.

For example, I found that running my dishwasher and stove during sunlight hours allows me to take full advantage of my panels’ output. Conversely, at night or during low sun, I shift to lighter loads or rely on my battery bank.

Battling Phantom Loads

One challenge that solar users often face is phantom loads — electricity that’s being drawn by devices or utilities even when not actively using them. This can sneak up on you and inflate your electric bills unnecessarily.

Through careful monitoring, I identified a consistent phantom load showing up during daylight hours, adding extra kilowatt-hours to my bill. Tracking and proving this helped me prepare documentation for challenging utility billing discrepancies.

Fine-Tuning for Efficiency

The goal is to have your system run like a well-oiled machine, with precise timing on when to draw from solar, batteries, or grid. Over time, this balance improves battery life and lowers costs.

By tweaking and measuring over months, I developed an understanding of exactly when to switch between power sources and how to avoid wasting stored energy.Chapter 4: Timing is Everything — Mastering the Solar Clock

Running your home on solar power isn’t just about having the panels up and batteries installed — it’s about understanding time. Solar power is a dance with the sun, and the more precisely you can time your energy production, storage, and consumption, the more efficient and independent you become.

The Importance of Solar Timing

Your system’s performance changes minute by minute. At sunrise, your panels begin waking up — producing a trickle of voltage. By mid-morning, you’re pushing usable current. Peak production usually hits between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM, depending on your location, orientation, and the season. That’s your power window — your golden hours.

If you know when that peak hits, you can schedule your energy-heavy activities — laundry, cooking, charging devices — to fall right inside it. This is how you preserve your battery bank and avoid relying on the grid when it’s unnecessary.

My Timing Strategy

In my case, I’ve tracked my system down to precision. I know that if I flip the system to solar mode at exactly 12:01 PM, my batteries stabilize at 13.9 volts, with the charge controller reporting 14.0+ as it regulates. By 12:05 PM, I’m already hitting peak current. That level of precision allows me to decide:

When to shift heavy loads off the grid

When to let the solar system carry the house entirely

When to hold the batteries in reserve


The Midday Shift

I call this the “midday shift” — a deliberate decision made every day, like clockwork. Once I confirm solar output is stable, I transition the house off the grid. If batteries are sitting at 13.8V or higher, and the incoming current is strong, I flip the switch.

It’s not about automation — it’s about awareness. You don’t just set it and forget it; you learn the rhythm, and you dance with it.

What Happens After Dark?

Once the sun starts to dip and production wanes, you’ve got choices:

Shift back to grid before batteries dip below 12.3V, to preserve battery health

Let the system coast into evening with low-draw devices only

Use your knowledge of expected load vs. remaining charge to decide what stays on and what gets turned off


Timing your return to the grid can be just as important. If you wait too long, you risk damaging the battery bank. But if you switch too early, you waste the stored energy you worked to build all day.

Pro Tip: Don't Chase Perfection — Chase Consistency

It’s easy to want to micro-manage every second of solar production, but the real goal is consistency. Once you learn your system’s rhythm — and your home’s usage patterns — it becomes second nature.Chapter 5: The Battery Bank – Power in Reserve

When the sun goes down, the real test begins.

That’s where your battery system steps in—not just as a backup, but as the heart of your off-grid living strategy. Your battery bank determines how long your house can run when the panels stop producing. If your system is the engine, the battery bank is the fuel tank.

Our Setup: Simplicity with Power

We run a practical and efficient setup with three 100Ah lithium-ion batteries, wired for 12V. That gives us 300 amp-hours of stored energy, with high discharge capacity and faster charging cycles than traditional lead-acid systems. We chose lithium for their durability, depth of discharge, and ability to handle our daily load demands without stressing the system.

At full charge, our bank can handle critical appliances, LED lighting, and even our compact dishwasher without breaking a sweat.

Why Lithium-Ion?

Deeper Discharge: You can use up to 90% of their capacity, unlike lead-acid batteries which typically tap out at 50%.

Longer Life Span: Some lithium batteries push well beyond 4,000 cycles.

Low Maintenance: No water levels to check or acid corrosion to manage.

Compact Power: Lightweight, compact, and packs a punch.


Knowing When to Flip the Switch

We’ve trained ourselves to monitor the system in real time. Voltage readings become second nature. At 12.88V, we’re fully loaded. 12.6V to 12.4V is our ""golden zone"" during use. Anything lower and we decide whether it’s time to shut off unnecessary appliances—or flip back to grid (if needed).

This daily dance between solar production and battery storage is where you learn discipline. It's not just about having power—it's about knowing when to use it.

Overclocking for Flexibility

Now here’s a twist: our system is technically overclocked.

We’re running four panels for a 60A charge—but we’ve also got four more panels up top that aren’t even plugged in. They're pre-mounted, wired, and ready to go. That gives us the ability to instantly double our solar intake by plugging those into another charge controller, another inverter, or even a grid-tie connector.

It’s like having an extra engine in your car, ready to fire up when the road gets rough.

Redundancy is Resilience

This kind of overclocking gives us a key advantage: flexibility.

We can split the load between two inverters, redirect power where needed, or charge up additional storage in emergencies. Our system isn’t just running—it’s prepared.

Key Takeaways:

3x 100Ah lithium-ion batteries provide strong, long-lasting reserve.

Monitoring voltage is essential to timing usage and recharge.

Overclocking with unused panels gives you a built-in expansion option.

Redundancy isn’t waste—it’s preparedness.Chapter 6: Load Management—The Real-Time Dance Between Power and Priority

When living off-grid, every watt matters. Unlike grid-tied systems where electricity is essentially on-demand, an off-grid solar setup requires awareness, timing, and discipline. Load management isn’t just a technical process—it’s a lifestyle.

Understanding the Load Curve

Throughout the day, your home experiences energy spikes—moments when power demand is significantly higher than normal. This usually happens:

In the morning when lights, coffee makers, and devices power up.

Midday if the sun’s out and heavy appliances kick on.

Evenings, when multiple devices compete with dwindling solar input.


In an off-grid home, these moments can make or break your system’s stability—especially if your battery charge is low or if sunlight is minimal.

How We Monitor and Adapt in Real-Time

We’ve fine-tuned the system to watch voltage and amperage drop in real-time, especially when key devices kick on. Take this example:

> “I turned on the dishwasher. Voltage dropped from 12.88 to 12.84 almost instantly. But it held steady around 12.86 once the cycle began.”



That tells us the system can absorb the startup surge and then comfortably stabilize—a sign of both healthy batteries and efficient device draw.

Each device has a “signature.” You learn to recognize them. A microwave causes a sudden sharp drop, while a fridge compressor might cause a slower, but more prolonged dip. We've used this real-time data to decide what appliances can run together—and which ones must wait.

Load Prioritization: What Comes First

If battery voltage is sitting low and sunlight is limited, priorities change. Our setup follows a strict load priority protocol:

1. Essentials (lighting, communication gear, and emergency systems)


2. Refrigeration (keeps food safe)


3. Short-use appliances (microwave, coffee maker)


4. High-drain devices (washer/dryer, dishwasher, window AC units)



When we’re flush with sun and battery charge, we can greenlight everything. But in cloudy conditions or late afternoons, we often choose peace of mind over convenience. A simple decision like delaying a laundry load until morning can save your entire battery bank from hitting the danger zone.

Load Smoothing Through Timing

We also take advantage of ""load smoothing,"" which is the art of spacing out when certain appliances run. Instead of stacking power draws back-to-back, we sequence them.

For example:

9:00 a.m. – Run the coffee pot and charge phones.

10:00 a.m. – Turn on the dishwasher.

11:00 a.m. – Run the washing machine.

12:00 p.m. – Allow the fridge compressor its cycle during solar peak.


This sequencing prevents hard hits to battery voltage and extends lifespan.

The Real Test: When We Shut It All Down

At one point in testing, we flipped the entire house breaker off to isolate and measure phantom loads (those sneaky devices pulling power even when “off”). The meter’s dot slowed to a near standstill—a clear indicator that every trickle of draw was gone.

After flipping the breaker back on, we monitored how long it took for the dot to tick again. Seventeen seconds. That’s how precise we’ve gotten. The power company is still charging us even when we’re off-grid—and we’ve got the timestamped evidence to prove it.
Chapter 7: Phantom Loads & Energy Vampires — Exposing the Hidden Drain

Even when you think everything is off, your home may still be consuming power. These silent energy thieves are known as phantom loads, and they’re one of the most overlooked yet persistent challenges in solar living.

What Is a Phantom Load?

A phantom load (also known as a standby load or vampire load) is the electricity consumed by devices that are plugged in but not actively in use. Think televisions, microwave clocks, Wi-Fi routers, power adapters, or even that Keurig machine with its blinking light.

They seem harmless—until you start living on solar.

When you're running off-grid, every watt counts. What might seem like a trickle on the grid becomes a flood when you're living off battery reserves. Your lithium-ion system doesn’t care if it’s a TV or a toaster—it sees constant power draw.

How We Found the Phantom Load

We didn’t just guess—we tested. We ran the system isolated from the grid, then shut everything off via the main breaker. We observed the power meter. And guess what? The city meter was still moving.

The dot ticked every 17 seconds, even when everything inside was supposedly shut down. That shouldn’t happen—unless something external was bleeding power, or a hidden system was drawing current unbeknownst to us. And when the dot slowed to a near standstill, we knew we’d found the ghost.

Documenting the Discovery

Every piece of this was logged. Over the course of days and weeks, we isolated appliances. We learned:

Our dishwasher caused a minor voltage drop (from 12.88V to 12.84V)

Lights and chargers, though small individually, added up quickly

Even when we shut off breakers, the city meter kept spinning, hinting at phantom infrastructure-level tampering or parasitic draw from the utility side


We learned to trust the data, not the labels. You may think something is “off,” but unless it’s unplugged or completely isolated, it might still be sipping your power.

How to Fight Back

Install kill switches or smart plugs to completely shut off circuits

Unplug chargers and unused devices (especially anything with a light or display)

Use power strips to easily cut off multiple devices at once

Isolate and test: Shut off your main breaker and watch your meter. If it’s still ticking, investigate further


The Bigger Problem: Infrastructure Load Injection

In our case, we’re starting to suspect something even more disturbing—a phantom load being injected by the utility company. Meter spinning while off-grid is not normal. It points to a possible infrastructure-level ghost load, either from dirty metering practices or an intentional buffer that’s charging you for what you never used.

We’ll go deeper into that in Chapter 8.

But for now, remember this:

> ""What you don't see can drain you—and in solar living, hidden consumption is the difference between a thriving system and a dead battery.""Chapter 8: The Phantom Load – Hidden Power Drains and How to Beat Them

One of the most overlooked elements in solar energy optimization is the phantom load—also known as standby power or vampire power. These are the sneaky little energy drains that continue pulling power even when a device appears to be off. If you’re living on solar, phantom loads are the enemy. They silently chip away at your stored energy and can throw off your entire system efficiency.

What is a Phantom Load?

A phantom load is any electricity consumed by electronics or appliances when they’re plugged in but not actively in use. Think:

Microwaves with clocks

TVs on standby

Coffee makers with timers

Phone chargers left plugged in

Wi-Fi routers running 24/7

Smart devices waiting for voice commands


Individually, these loads seem minor. But collectively, they can shave hours off your stored battery life—especially at night when you're not generating solar input.

How We Detected It

In our home system, we took a systematic approach. We powered everything off at the breaker level and monitored the digital utility meter. When the entire home was shut off, the meter's blinking dot slowed to a near standstill. That confirmed our baseline: zero or near-zero grid pull.

Then, by flipping breakers back on one by one, we watched how long it took the meter to blink. A fast blink meant something was drawing phantom power. One dot every 17 seconds meant a measurable load had returned. This granular testing allowed us to isolate exactly where and when the phantom loads were occurring.

Real-World Data Speaks Volumes

We’ve run real-time tests during peak sun and night hours. Our voltage levels gave us instant feedback. For instance:

Turning on the small countertop dishwasher dropped the voltage from 12.88V to 12.84V.

During standby operation, the voltage barely budged — evidence of efficient use and minimal phantom draw.

With careful monitoring, we noticed how even when ""off,"" some devices still slightly influenced battery drain.


This hands-on testing revealed the truth: the system doesn’t lie. If the voltage dips without any major appliances on, something is sipping your power in the background.

How to Eliminate Phantom Load

Use Smart Power Strips: These cut power completely to devices when not in use.

Unplug Unused Chargers: Especially overnight when you rely on stored solar energy.

Hard Kill Switches: Like a full power strip with an off toggle.

Break Down Usage by Circuit: Flip breakers systematically to track hidden draws.

Install Real-Time Energy Monitors: Get per-outlet usage data in real time.


Phantom Load in a Solar World

In a solar-powered household, every watt matters. Phantom load isn’t just annoying—it’s costly. It adds up to hours of battery life wasted or even grid power being pulled when you thought you were off-grid.

By identifying, isolating, and eliminating these hidden power thieves, we took another major step toward mastering full control of our home’s energy use.

We didn’t just chase the problem—we clocked it, timed it, tracked it, and beat it.Chapter 9: Power Flow Strategy and Energy Efficiency

A key part of mastering off-grid solar living is understanding how to manage the flow of power throughout your daily cycle. Our system is built around balance, timing, and real-world efficiency—not theoretical numbers from a sales brochure. We've learned to adapt, optimize, and evolve every component based on field data and lived experience.

Off-Grid Operation Strategy: Our power strategy is designed to reduce dependency on the grid while maintaining consistent energy availability. We operate on a routine cycle:

17 hours off-grid using solar-charged battery power.

7 hours on-grid during the lowest solar input (usually nighttime), where power demand is supplemented or battery recharging is balanced if needed.


This pattern wasn’t chosen at random. It’s the result of careful monitoring, adjustment, and logging of usage patterns over time. We analyzed peak appliance hours, solar output efficiency windows, and even seasonal daylight variation.

Battery Management and Output: With three lithium-ion batteries at 100 Ah each, we’ve got a reliable 300 Ah power bank. On average, we consume around 7 kilowatts per day—spanning both off-grid and on-grid use. That 7kW average is spread across essential appliances, occasional high-drain cycles (like dishwashers or laundry), and the natural loss associated with inverter operation and phantom loads.

We’ve also tested the tipping points. We’ve run tests with heavy draw cycles, and we’ve tracked battery voltage drop minute by minute. That real-time data gives us insight into efficiency loss, inverter lag, and the actual runtime per volt drop. All of it gets factored into when we shift to grid or remain independent.

Load Distribution: One critical takeaway is that not all load needs to be carried by the solar system at once. Certain appliances can be run in scheduled bursts. We schedule dishwashers, charge cycles, or any high-drain items during high-sunlight hours (typically between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.), maximizing direct panel-to-use flow and reducing battery drain.

Efficiency Summary:

Off-Grid Operation: 17 hours

On-Grid Supplementation: 7 hours

Average Daily Usage: ~7 kWh

Battery Bank: 300 Ah (lithium-ion)


This configuration has been tested, verified, and adjusted live. And the takeaway? You don’t need a massive battery bank or a rooftop full of panels if you understand your flow. You just need strategy, timing, and real-time awareness.

In the next chapter, we’ll dive into how weather, cloud cover, and even temperature impact your solar yield—and how to adjust for that on the fly.Chapter 10: Mastering Energy Management — How to Spot and Eliminate Phantom Loads

One of the biggest hidden drains on your solar energy system is what’s called the phantom load — energy that gets used even when it shouldn’t be. It’s like a ghost in your electric system, quietly siphoning power and inflating your electric bill without you realizing it.

What is a Phantom Load?

Phantom loads, also known as “vampire power,” are the electricity consumed by appliances and devices when they are turned off or in standby mode but still plugged in. Examples include TVs with remote controls, phone chargers left in the socket, or even certain smart meters manipulated to show higher usage.

Why Phantom Loads Matter

Phantom loads can add up quickly and make your solar system work harder than it needs to. They create misleading data about your actual consumption, which becomes a big issue if you’re trying to accurately monitor and reduce your energy use. Worse yet, if your utility company is sneaking in phantom loads intentionally (like the case we uncovered in Elba), it can mean you’re being overcharged unfairly.

How to Detect Phantom Loads

Monitor Your Meter Dots: By carefully observing the spinning dots on your watt-hour meter, you can tell when power is being used. For example, if the dots continue moving when all your breakers are off, that’s a strong sign of a phantom load.

Go Off-Grid for Testing: Switching your home off-grid lets you see if your meter continues to register usage. No usage should be detected if everything is truly off.

Track Battery Voltages: Watching your battery voltages drop unexpectedly during periods when you’re not actively using power is another clue.

Use a Kill-A-Watt Meter: This device plugs into outlets and measures how much power specific devices draw, even in standby mode.


Real-World Phantom Load Example

In our solar setup, we documented phantom loads fluctuating between 1,000 to 4,000 watts during peak hours, even when all heavy appliances were off. This invisible drain cost us hundreds of dollars extra on our electric bill — an expense we uncovered through dedicated meter tracking and off-grid testing.

How to Eliminate Phantom Loads

Unplug Devices When Not In Use: The simplest solution is to unplug chargers, electronics, and appliances when you’re not actively using them.

Use Smart Power Strips: These can automatically cut power to groups of devices, preventing phantom energy leaks.

Upgrade Your Appliances: Newer energy-efficient models tend to have lower standby power draws.

Challenge Your Utility Company: If you suspect intentional phantom charging, collect and present your data to local authorities or utility regulators.


Conclusion

Phantom loads are one of the silent saboteurs of solar efficiency and energy independence. By learning to spot and manage them, you’re taking back control of your power, saving money, and optimizing your solar system like a pro.Chapter 11: Complete System Breakdown — Inside the Solar Living Blueprint

This chapter is the heart of the Solar Living Blueprint. Here, we pull back the curtain and reveal every detail of the system I’ve designed, tested, and perfected over the last several years. If you want to replicate this at home or simply understand how solar power can be optimized beyond what’s commonly taught, this chapter is for you.

1. Overview of the System

Panels: 8 total solar panels, each capable of producing roughly 60 amps. Right now, I’m running on four panels actively, which are enough to supply the system, but I have the other four panels ready to connect for overclocking, future expansion, or dedicated loads.

Charge Controllers: Multiple MPPT charge controllers managing panel input and battery charging.

Batteries: Three lithium-ion batteries rated at 100Ah each, wired to maximize both capacity and longevity.

Inverter: Pure sine wave inverter converting DC battery power to household AC loads.

Load Management: System designed to prioritize and sequence loads to optimize battery health and reduce phantom loads.


2. Overclocking Explained

Overclocking in solar terms means using more panel capacity than the charge controllers or batteries might traditionally handle at once, giving headroom for surges and future expansions.

I have four panels currently not in use.

These can be connected to a separate inverter, charge controller, or grid-tie system.

This setup allows me to boost available power during peak production hours or connect specialized equipment directly to these extra panels.


3. Phantom Load Detection and Countermeasures

One of the biggest challenges in solar living is the phantom load — energy that’s being drawn or charged through the meter but never used in the home.

Using detailed meter readings, battery voltages, and charge controller logs, I identified phantom loads averaging around 1,000 to 4,000 watts, especially during peak city utility hours.

Tracking the utility meter’s pulse (the “dots”) helped me pinpoint when phantom loads start and stop.

Going off-grid at strategic times allows us to monitor and measure real usage versus phantom usage.

This data is compiled into a dossier for potential legal and regulatory challenges.


4. Battery Monitoring and Usage

Batteries typically fluctuate between 12.8 and 13.2 volts during operation.

Load turning on/off events are tracked by voltage changes to correlate power consumption.

Quick charging and slow charging windows are identified by PV input and battery voltage behavior.

Quick showers and dishwasher cycles are scheduled during peak solar input times to reduce battery strain.


5. Load Scheduling and Eco Mode Usage

Two AC units run on eco mode to keep energy draw minimal.

Loads such as ovens, dishwashers, and water heaters are scheduled during high solar production.

Lights and electronics are selectively used to manage load spikes.

Manual switching between grid and off-grid modes based on predicted phantom load times.


6. System Expansion and Future-Proofing

Unused panels and inverters remain ready for future expansion or specialized off-grid loads.

The system is designed modularly to add batteries, controllers, or grid-tie devices as needed.

Manual overrides and monitoring protocols allow for rapid troubleshooting and optimization.


7. Data Logging and Analysis

Continuous logging of meter readings, battery voltages, and charge controller data is vital.

This data supports:

Energy use optimization

Phantom load detection

Solar production forecasting


Logging also aids in accountability if utility companies attempt fraudulent billing.


8. Final Thoughts

This system is not just about equipment, but about a philosophy of living in harmony with the sun, the earth, and the grid. It’s about reclaiming control over your energy usage and breaking free from unfair utility practices.

1mreogr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1mreogr/my_journey_so_far_and_im_hoping_for_advice/,My journey so far and I’m hoping for advice,"So I was raised in an agnostic household. Neither one of my parents are religious but when I was 19 I started researching different faiths and different religious because I lost someone to suicide and I wasn’t even that close to him. I did have a crush on him but that’s just all it was and about 5 months after he died, I remember his mom telling me something about how she had a dream of him and that he told her in that dream that he wasn’t happy where he was at so I was like “omg, what if he’s in hell?” And he and his mom were actually involved in Mexican Witchcraft so I started thinking to myself that he probably really was in hell and it affected me. I’ve never lost anyone. He was the first person that I actually knew that died so it did impact my life and I had been agnostic for most of my life up until this point but for some reason those words really hit me and it made me start thinking all kinds of things so I decided to start researching different religions and faiths like Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and different Christian denominations and they all had different beliefs about what happens after death and I even attended a seventh day Adventist church for a while and I took Bible studies with them for like 5 months and they believe in soul sleep and it brought a sense of comfort for me because I didn’t want to picture my crush burning in hell so I believed in soul sleep for a while and they really had the mentality of not talking about death all all because they believed that life is for the living not the dead and that we will see them again after the resurrection so they told me that I wasn’t supposed to remember them on their death anniversary because it was like necromancy or something and I was supposed to get baptized after I finished the Bible studies but after a while, I just didn’t feel like I was in the right denomination like I felt like there was something missing so I ended up stopping the Bible lessons and stopped attending that church and I was considering attending a Roman Catholic Church because they really called out to me. I mean, it is a very beautiful faith and I was just attracted to the beauty that they had and they believe in praying for the dead and purgatory so I was pretty close to attending a Roman Catholic Church but at the last minute I discovered the Eastern Orthodox Church and I just felt so drawn to it so I decided to go to an Eastern Orthodox Church instead and I actually found one that was walking distance from my house. It’s only a 10 minute walk so that’s the church I started attending and I usually only talk to the same people because I’m very shy so I only talk to other Catuchems like me and I’m also really shy to approach the priest and ask him questions and I also have to choose my godparents cause my baptism might come in a few months and I have no idea who I’m choose cause I usually only talk to the same 5 people so for the next few weeks, I’m start sitting at different tables with different people so that I can start getting to know more people so I’m trying to improve my confidence but I do have a problem in making friends in general cause I’m really shy. I’m also unemployed and have been unemployed for 4 years and I just can’t seem to find a job. I’ve been applying to so many but I can’t find any. What I really want to do is be a court interpreter but I failed the written test 3 times and I only have one more chance. I need an 80% to pass and I’ve only gotten 78%. They change the questions every time and I just can’t seem to get past the 78% so I’ve been applying to jobs meanwhile so that I can pay for the tests myself since my mom’s been paying for them meanwhile and it make me feel guilty but I just can’t seem to find a job. The last time I had a job was when I was 18 which was 3 years ago so I’m struggling financially, I also don’t have a drivers license because I just can’t seem to learn how to drive and I’ve had so many different people teach me my parents, aunt, friends, driving instructor but I still haven’t learned so I feel so useless because I can’t really go out and whenever I want to go somewhere that’s church related, I have to have one of my friends from church drive me so I spent most of my days being home all day. I only have 2 friends outside of church and I’ve know them for 10+ years but I rarely see them cause one of them, her mom is really strict so she doesn’t always let her go out and hang out so I see her like every 3 months. The other one lives like an hour away from me so her I only see once a year cause she also works and has college so she’s really busy so I’m very lonely, mostly home all day and I also don’t have a job so it does make me feel kind of depressed.
I also yearn for a romantic partner. The only person that I’ve ever came close to loving was the guy that committed suicide and it’s already been 3 years since he died but it’s still in the back of my mind because I obviously don’t want him to burn in hell,(hades) and I also do want a romantic partner. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and I’ve never had luck with boys. I’ve liked so many guys in my life but the only one that I came close to loving was the one that died however I’ve been having a crush on a guy from my church cause I talk with him almost every Sunday during coffee hour and I just love talking to him. I don’t know what it is but I’ve developed a crush on him over the past months cause and I think I am starting to really really like him and I do want to know if he’s single because if he’s taken them I am going to be heartbroken so that’s what been going on in my life so far. I did decide to make Saint Xenia my patron saint because I can really relate to her story because I’m broke, unemployed, and lonely so what advice would you guys give me?

I am a Henry that has been 10 years in a job,  with last 7 in Henry territory (henry level: waaaay into pension tapering territory).

I am however somewhat tired of politics but too down to earth to walk away (despite having another stream of income - not henry but grossing about 27k/year).

The problem I have is that I looked for roles just way earlier in my career and they were much junior roles. So I don’t know how to move.

I can still go down the cv route but seems inefficient. I started to list up all my network and connecting for coffees etc. I even have a template linkedin message to roll out if I decide to go full throttle (I am going slowly atm).

Question I have for you all is - how would you approach this search? What would you even ask? Hey I am open for a nee position?

For reference, financial sector, london based.
Note that even if they sack me tomorrow I can survive on savings investments etc for about 17 years. And work is not super bad - just starting to be disillusioned and I’d like optionality. In any case, not pressed with time.

Any suggestion welcome!
TIA!

1mremzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mremzw/partner_left_me_abruptly_here_are_some_things_i/,Partner left me abruptly... Here are some things I wish I'd worked more on,"Okay so he left me, and I'm reflecting a lot. Getting therapy, taking my meds, and resting where possible. It's been a big wake up call in many ways. I'm trying to be my biggest and most mature self now and keeping coparenting positive and peaceful for the sake of my child. Blaming and yelling and begging him to change his mind isn't going to increase the hurts for everyone. And guess what, it's actually going well!!! 

Now, our relationship may have always been doomed to fail, because we each have childhood trauma and sn anxious/avoidant dynamic that was extremely hard on both of us. He wanted calm, whilst I was anything but calm. I wanted openness and dialogue, he struggled to be in touch with his emotions. 

BUT, whilst not taking the blame for everything that happened, here are some things I wish I had taken more seriously and gotten more help to work on both adhd and cptsd: 

- space - I knew my partner needed space as a person. He did in every aspect of his life. But my need for constant validation and reassurance meant I couldn't give it to him. I challenged his every attempt to get space as a sign be didn't really love me. In reality, I didn't allow him space to feel safe and it exposed the lack of trust I had for him. Whilst I got a little better at this and he tried to help me too, it was not enough... I also talked at him constantly when he needed time to process every thing I said, it was hard work 🤣. 

- anxiety, emotional reactivity and impatience - I lashed out at him for many a little thing that he did too slowly or differently, and then was fine afterwards. I policed almost everything he did with our child. Though I would apologise and try to change that pattern of behaviour, it took its toll. His body was still in fight or flight and I couldn't understand why, expecting him to bounce back. It triggered my anxiety when he wasn't seeming happy (often it'd be hours or days later so I was confused) and he would withdraw further. More consistent therapy or understanding about the impact it was having would have helped me. Also meds!

- dependence - I took for granted that he would do my laundry, make my coffee and breakfast and manage my money. Now, there were things that i did that he took for granted too, but now that I am doing these things for myself, I can see that I actually needed to be more independent. 

- rsj - getting upset because of a look, or overthinking how something was said and then questioning or starting an argument over it, really drove a wedge between us. 

Anyone who is in a situation like me, particularly if your partner also has emotional or attachment issues, don't be sad it didn't work out! Working on ourselves, understanding what our needs are and how we can meet them without hurting others, is always going to be a good outcome in the end. ",12,1755301961.0,adhdwomen,2,0.93,False

Hi y'all! Just realized It's almost been exactly one year since I did my initial post so figure I might as well do another since I was doing a personal financial review anyways and I like it when others share their progress and thoughts - I'm a big fan of transparent real talk when it comes to money. I'd love to hear your thoughts or questions if you have them. I'm also always open to advice and input because I know things could certainly always be improved! Also in case this reads weird, I'm basically writing it sequentially as I do my financial review for the last year so I'm running the numbers and finding new info as I write this. If it feels a little disjointed because of that, please bear with me.

# Previous Post(s):

September 2024: [First Update - 24M, $34k](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1fnwmdu/first_update_24m_34k/)

# Intro

I'm 25 now, I've got a B.S. and an M.S. in Computer Science. I've been working full time since fall 2022 as a Software Engineer and I love it. I also love all things numbers and spreadsheets so naturally it brings me lots of enjoyment to work with my own finances.

# Student Loans

So as I laid out before, $22k in loans for undergrad and $20k for grad school for $42k total coming out of school. All federal, avg. interest rate of \~4.5%. I've been on a pretty slow repayment plan since bond rates are a full basis point higher than my loans (also because I've been saving aggressively to get into real estate which I'll discuss more later). Been repaying about $160 a month which brings my total down to $39,800. I could definitely afford to be more aggressive on this but I keep a relatively low risk profile on my investments (at least compared to most in my demographic) so I'm comfortable leveraging this debt to invest over a long period.

# Career

Still live in the small-medium city in the midwest with a low-ish cost of living. I've got a great place I'm living in and with 3 roommates my rent is just under $700 a month. On the job side, I've been blessed to not have been adversely affected by all the mass layoffs in the tech market since I work on the startup side which is slightly insulated here in the midwest (not very big to begin with so less fat to trim). 2 months after my original post, I left that remote job to go work for another startup which was smaller and started by a guy I had worked with before and that I believe in a lot (I had invested in the company when he left to go full time). I took a pay cut but got an equity position and I love my job so much more. Also I was given two options: higher salary and lower equity or lower salary and higher equity. I chose the higher salary and lower equity.

**Salary**:  
**2022**: $72.5k (starting salary)  
**2023**: $72.5k -> $85k -> $100k  
**2024**: $100k -> $86k  
**2025**: $86k -> $92k -> $97.2k

**Equity**:  
First off, I will note that I'm not counting this equity position in my net worth since there's numerous factors that come into play before I can actually get anything out of it. First is that the company would have to go public, get acquired, or start profit sharing - none of which is guaranteed to happen. Second is that there could be dilution to bring on additional investment in the future. It's harder to lay out equity positions than salary so I'll give an overview - I was offered 1.5% vesting over 4 years with a one-year cliff. I had a really strong first week and on my first day I grabbed a non-insignificant task and got a PR up by 2:00pm that we merged that day so between that first week and the two founders already knowing me well, they bumped up my vesting by a year so I had 25% of my options vested that first week. Earlier this year (2025) they also informed me since things are going well that they'd be adding another set of options to my total vesting that would bring me up to equivalent to 2.0% equity (which just so happened to be the higher equity number offered). That also bumped the amount vested since half of that new pool went into the vested part of my schedule. We also completed a fundraising round at a higher evaluation. If we sold today at the current valuation then my total equity position would be $200,000 (options) + $16,000 (seed investment) = $216,000.  
**2024**: 0.375% x $5,000,000 valuation = $18,750  
**2025**: 0.92% x $10,000,000 valuation = $92,000

# Net Worth Change

So, the number went up a solid amount over the last year. Obviously it was affected by the fact that I took a large pay cut (-$14k) for a bit and I actually missed a pretty large bonus because of when I left (but I love this job so much more, I lost my anxiety over that the first week). One milestone that I enjoyed was that my invested assets crossed the $100k line which was neat - now my money is really starting to work for me. Even though I did take a pay cut, the markets did quite well this year and I cashed out of a crypto position I'd been DCA'ing into for \~3 years. Obviously it's shot up very recently so there's missed opportunity but I still made healthy margin so I'm perfectly happy with that. Overall, I still like to watch the number go up but I'd say I get less personal satisfaction out of it than last year because now rather than comparing against my student loans as a benchmark, the only real benchmark I have is retirement 25-30 years from now so it feels quite arbitrary and the numbers don't seem real.  
**Jan. 2023:** \-$36k  
**Dec. 2023:** $4.7k  
**Sep. 2024:** $34.9k  
**Aug. 2025:** $72.0k

# Money Thoughts

It was a good year - great job change, and salary has come back to about where it was at. Honestly I have no idea how I've been so fortunate and blessed with constant raises (only one of which I actually had to ask for), especially in the midst of so many layoffs. I don't really have any advice other than the fact that most layoffs are from big tech companies that pay a lot but grow and shrink fast and aggressively so be wary of them.

A common theme with FIRE is people sacrificing quality of life and fun now in exchange for retirement later. I've been fortunate that I make enough to save and have fun, but also that me and my friends like having cheap fun - I've traveled a little bit this year but mostly we get together, have cookouts, play pickleball, watch movies, etc. (also none of us really drink so I don't go out to bars). I find myself very satisfied with life and the fact that I know staying the course will provide both for my retirement and my future family.

This is a pure finance update so I'll keep it focused to that but I met a wonderful woman through my church and things are progressing such that I'm slowly moving some\* finances toward a lower risk profile that's more palatable in a partnership. That being said:

# Real Estate

Alright so moving on, here's a big change - I'm going in on an investment property with some partners and we close next month. It's a brand new construction that I'm very familiar with and I'm using a property management company to handle all the operations. The goal is to get returns marginally better than the market without introducing large amounts of stress to my life. With interest rates where they are right now (and obviously including all costs/ management fees/etc.), we're looking at about 6% COC return for the first year going up to 10.6% by year 5. Overall return with equity is obviously higher with avg. yearly return projecting to be \~16% by year 5. The goal is that if interest rates go down then we could refinance and the numbers will get even better, but I'm perfectly happy where they are now. My share of the down payment will be $35,000 so a pretty big chunk of change but I've had 'real estate' earmarked in my savings for 3 years since I started my first job so it's all within budget.

On the partnership side, I shared before that it's friends and family. I've done a lot of research and I've been working on a large partnership agreement while also being very active in communicating expectations to everyone. The partnership agreement is less about locking people in and more about level setting and making sure we all have shared expectations. I've been selling it as a ""make a moderate amount of return on money you don't need any time in the next 5 years"" opportunity rather than ""get rich quick"". In fact, I've explicitly told everyone this won't make them rich, but it's a stepping stone on a path that does create wealth. I feel pretty good, especially with using a property management company so that nobody has to put in any work (besides me, but I'm getting an extra 1% management cut of the LLC).

# Budget

Budget hasn't really changed. One thing to note is that I noticed my grocery budget getting outrageously out of hand. Switched to Aldi's and the next month's grocery spend was about 60% of the previous month. I've done a couple of smaller trips in the last year and I'm planning a cruise with friends next summer (also potentially a honeymoon but that is not a sure thing yet lol). My budget is pretty close to how reality plays out, though there's always other things. Got hit with a big tax bill so that ate into my saving for the year ($4,200).

Here is the breakdown on my budget spreadsheet compared to the actual breakdown from the last year. *Note: I haven't actually gone through before and truly reconciled my yearly spending compared to the exact budget - I more compare month-to-month. As I'm doing this I'm realizing that my category groups in my finance tracking app don't really map all that well to the Need/Want/Donation (i.e. Gifts & Donations are grouped up but gifts are more 50/50 between Need and Want and I wouldn't really consider them donations)*. I've tried to map my actual spending to Need/Want/Donations as best I can, though as I was goin through I probably was biased and put more things in need than I should have.

|Category|Proj. %|Proj. $ Value|Actual %|Actual $ Value|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Need|23.3%|$15,840|37.2%|$26,200|Bills, Rent, Insurance, Groceries, Taxes, Gym membership|
|Want|8.8%|$6,000|19.3%|$13,600|Eating out, coffee, misc. shopping, golf|
|Donation|9.5%|$6,456|10.2%|$7,200|Church, other|
|Savings|58.4%|$39,600|33.3%|$23,500|Debt payments, Investments, Travel savings, Emergency Fund|
|Total|100%|$67,896|100%|$72,500|The net was pretty close given that I wrote this 2.5 years ago lol. Also there was another $2,000 spread among tiny categories I didn't want to go through.|

Alrighty so after crunching the numbers and doing this review I'm realizing that my numbers were pretty off. While the assets grew by almost that budgeted amount, a solid portion of it was from capital gains rather than raw saving ($23,500 from saving, $35,000-$23,500=$11,500 from capital gains). This is actually really eye-opening because going month-to-month, I could see that I was a little off-budget but I figured it wasn't a large amount. Turns out it was but most of the difference was being made up by capital gains. I should probably review where I can cut things from the various categories and try to encourage better spending habits in myself.

Things I've worked to improve on this year:

1- **Grocery Spending**: I switched from Hy-Vee to Aldi's, though I do still get some things at Sam's Club (Bulk items but also some of that spending is clothing). My avg. monthly grocery bill Aug '24 - Feb '25 was **$422** and from Mar '25 - Jul '25 it's been **$268**. I'm pretty happy with this because the change was twofold: first, I am now shopping somewhere with significantly cheaper prices. Second, since Aldi's is a smaller store, I spend less time wandering the aisles grabbing things I don't need; I write down my list in the exact order that things are in the store, I make my loop and grab what I need then get out.

2- **Eating Out**: I've been trying to eat out less. Started dating that girl halfway through the year so obviously I've been taking her out and treating her to some good food every so often. Taking that into account, I feel like these numbers aren't bad: first half of the year (single) my monthly eating out cost was **$310** and the second half of the last year (dating) my monthly eating out cost was **$296**. I mean it basically stayed the same but I think that's a win considering that I'm taking her out a couple times a month (I really should take her out more lol).

3- **Credit Card Fees**: I got a travel credit card a couple years ago that, if I made use of like half of the perks, would be worth it but they've since decreased perks, increased the annual fee (**$250 -> $350**), and I moved away from the hub for that airline so I never use it. I'm getting rid of that card and actually not getting a travel card because I don't travel with any given airline enough for it to be worth it. I instead am switching the lineup from \[Amex Delta Skymiles Platinum, Amex Blue Cash Preferred\] to \[Bilt Mastercard, Amex Blue Cash Preferred, either Fidelity or Robinhood\]. This'll bring my total annual fees from **$450** (absurd for my current situation) down to either **$145** or **$95**, depending on if I do Robinhood or Fidelity.

I should probably also work on what I actually consider as a need and what wants actually get purchased. One example is that I had a family wedding and I've lost a lot of weight recently so I brought in a suit to get it tailored and have it fit. I'd lost enough weight that the suit couldn't even get tailored so instead I was gonna buy a new one. I ended up looking at a sport coat that I absolutely loved and want to wear forever but it was about $460. I looked at cheaper ones but none of them actually excited me like that first one so I got the first one. There's a couple things like that where you can convince yourself that you technically need it when in reality you don't. I still haven't decided whether that was a completely fair purchase on my part, but I do know that I love the family photos we got there and I actually really like how I look in the photos so I'm leaning towards worth it.

Not to rant, but it's things like those that get you and set the stage for what your personal financial journey looks like. As long as you are still on track to meet your overall goals, it's ok to take your foot off the gas a little and enjoy life. Just don't sacrifice your future for it. That's a balance that we all always have to keep an eye on.

# Retirement Goals

I mean I'm 25 so I don't really have a hard-set number besides ""save and invest as much as you can"" as a main goal. That being said, I've set a general target for $6,000,000 which my estimates put at the age of 62. There will definitely be changes to this in the future, it's just a scenario I set up when I started my job in '22 assuming investing $1,400 a month with a 9% avg return on investments. Based on those extremely loose projections, I be at $55,000 in investments by the end of this month and we're currently at $107,000 as we saw above. Idk if I'll change the retirement goal or age or both but at the very bare minimum the future is very optimistic so I'm just gonna try and stick with it. I fully expect savings rate will drop when I eventually start a family so we'll see if I drop closer to the projections over time.

# Additional Thoughts

Alrighty on to the last section! If you're still here, that's pretty cool and we're probably quite similar at least in this aspect.

I really do enjoy going through the last year's finances because obviously I love numbers, but it's also a great time to reflect on memories and experiences that I had and consider what I want to prioritize / look forward to in the next year and the years to come after.

This last year I've felt less connected to the money than I did the previous two years. I'm legit not trying to brag but there's a numbing comfort to the relative ease of my career so far. I'm just having a good time, choosing to work with people I like, and I'm being well taken care of by the company without much effort in terms of advocating for myself. The paychecks hit twice a month and the number goes up but nothing tangible actually changes so I'll tune out for 2 weeks at a time until the next one hits and I'll take another look to see if my spending is wildly different from last months. I'm sure this post doesn't project much of a laissez-faire attitude toward my finances but I'm pretty chill during the year with random spurts of hyper attention on the numbers. The previous year I used to check my finance tracking app Monarch multiple times a week - I got a lot more enjoyment from watching the number go up but it was excessive. So for now I'd just say I'm very appreciative and satisfied with how it's going but I don't root much of my daily happiness in how the number is doing. Granted, we'll see if I still feel that way when the stock market starts going down.

Looking forward at the next year, it'll be the most dynamic year I've had in a while. It'll most likely involve: a wedding, honeymoon, moving (possibly to another country), real estate updates, startup updates, a cruise, and who knows what else!

Please feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, or just let me know your thoughts. I love discussing this stuff!

1mrefe8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrefe8,I’ve been documenting my neighbourhood for the past 7 years and I’m absolutely loving it.,"Warning, I have brain cancer and can be wordy! 

Hello, a bit about me: I’m Northern Ontario Metis who moved out west in the early 80s. I was keenly interested in photography at the time and wanted to become a news photographer. My gear was one Nikon FM and a 50mm lens. I settled in BC and after stringing for several newspapers I managed to land a full-time photographer / darkroom tech. I was absolutely thrilled.

Eventually, I transferred to larger newspapers, and my final posting was with a chain of 8 papers on Vancouver Island. The end of the 90s created much turmoil in traditional news media as many advertising budgets were being directed online. For me it was a 20-year dream job I absolutely loved.

Eventually, it just became too difficult to continue so I went to work in Business IT and Corporate Management. It was sad selling all my gear (3 Nikon F3 and a stable of lenses) but I wanted to make a clean break. I wish I had kept at least one F3 and a few lenses.

I worked in the business career for the next 20 years – it had a far more stable income, and I was raising young children at the time so that was important.

In 2018, the company I worked for decided to part ways after 18 years of employment. I was hurt – that was a major part of my life to just toss me aside.

A coworker knew I was formerly a photographer and sold me his Fuji F550EXR for $20. This was a time of photography’s popularity online – Instagram and other services were doing well, and it was relatively easy to build a community.

As I was not working at the time I shot most every day and posted to IG and was having fun. But I needed a purpose – I didn’t really enjoy just walking around taking random photos.

I thought about my roots as a photographer and decided Social Documentary would be my first try.  I I so enjoyed it I’m now in my 7^(th) year.

We live in a very quirky, eclectic neighbourhood that has been going through a lot of gentrifications the past few years. Counter that with the drug and homeless crisis and it’s proven to provide a wealth of photo and story opportunities.

The EastVan neighbourhood Broadway and Commercial Drive is where I do 90% of my photography. There is a major multi-tower development planned for the area in the next 5 years, and I’d planned on that being the pinnacle of this project.

Sadly, terminal brain cancer came along this spring and despite treatment the prognosis is not good for recovery. I had to reevaluate the project. I put the call out for a Take Over photographer who would continue with the project for the next 5-years. I’m still looking for one more photographer to ensure continuity. I’m pleased I found one so far.

And I’m currently working on a high-quality photo book for my photos of the past 7 years. I’m also printing a selection of large format archival prints as the Vancouver Archives has expressed interest in adding them to their collection. During my cancer treatment ups and downs I’ve found this to be an excellent project to keep me going instead of sitting around feeling sorry for myself.

My book is 50% done and the prints are as well. The prints are created on a pigment-based Canon Pro 1000 printer combined with Red River Paper – I’ve found this to be an excellent combination with an exceptional life span.

Documenting my neighbourhood has been very rewarding these past years – it’s only a few blocks from my home and very accessible. I’ve come to know so many of my subjects.

It’s a very important part of town as it serves a large senior / immigrant community with banking, medical, pharmacy, social and a grocery store. Due to the steadily increasing business rent costs since COVID there are many important small businesses that couldn’t make it. Gone, now are the dollar store, a bank, some medical offices, several restaurants and coffee shops – which served the retirement community as they would go out daily to visit friends.

**About The Hub: A major transportation link in Vancouver, Canada.**

The Hub at Broadway and Commercial Drive in East Vancouver, Canada, serves as a crucial transportation nexus connecting various destinations in the Lower Mainland. Approximately 100,000 individuals travel to this hub daily, primarily commuting to and from their workplaces. The vicinity also boasts a diverse array of shops and services, encompassing a grocery store, drugstore, multiple medical offices, a dollar store, three major banks, as well as several restaurants and coffee shops.

Aria's POV



I stood in front of the chapel.



Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.



The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.



Everything was perfect.



Except I wasn't the bride.



“I really need to see Jace today.”



I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.



""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.



I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.



But I have my reason to be here.



""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.



Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.



Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.



She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.



All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.



So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.



He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.



Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.



“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.



The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""



He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.



I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.



Instantly, I felt out of place.



Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.



And me?



I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.



""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.



No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.



But poverty had a scent, apparently.



""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”



“Thank you.”



The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.



And there he was.



The man I used to love.



Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.



Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.



When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.



""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.



And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.



Hey, Jace?!



That’s the best I could do?



His face was ice cold.



""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""



Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.



""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.



He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""



Wow.



I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.



I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.



""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""



Anger flared across his face.



""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""



“No.”



I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.



""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""



Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.



From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.



Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.



""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""



Was he fucking kidding me?!



""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.



“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”



He walked closer, smirking.



""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""



He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.



""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""



I was throwing my pride at his feet.



But he just laughed.



""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.



He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.



""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""



I widened my eyes in shock.



Then I slapped him. HARD.



“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.



""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""



Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.



Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.



God this couldn’t be any worse.



I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.



But I still let him get to me.



Now what do I do?



My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.



So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…



""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.



Too late.



I slammed right into the man in front of me.



He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.



His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.



In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.



“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.



This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.



When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.



Suddenly, I recognized who he was.



This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.



Jace’s brother-in-law.



THE legendary. Grayson Hart.



“Aria Collins?”



His voice was sexy and velvety.



He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.



Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.



But wait.



How did he know my name?



Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV



Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?



I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.



But there was no way he’d know who I was.



“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.



He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”



“Yes, Alpha.”



The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.



“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.



He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.



I looked down. A blank check.



“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.



But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.



“God,” I muttered under my breath.



Can you believe these rich bastards?



They think they can buy everything with money.



People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.



“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”



Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.



Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.



“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.



I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.



These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.



After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.



“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.



“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.



But they blocked me.



“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”



They burst into laughter together.



“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”



I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”



Their jaws dropped.



“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.



“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.



“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”



They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.



Rich people were assholes.



Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.



I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.



It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.



I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.



I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.



So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.



She texted back right away inviting me to come over.



Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.



Then I heard them.



“Hey, nice shirt!”



A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.



I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.



“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”



Go away. Go away. Go away.



“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.



“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.



But it only fired them up.



“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”



They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.



I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.



Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…



Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.



A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.



The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:



“Get in.”



I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.



“My suitcase!” I cried.



“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”



I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.



That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.



His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.



My head started to get dizzy.



“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.



“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.



He snorted.



Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.



I held my breath.



Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.



“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.



My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.



“We’ve met,” he said simply.



I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.



“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.



But I couldn’t control myself.



I was leaning forward.



Shit. Why did my body become so weird?



My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.



The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.



I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.



This…This was crazy.



He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.



And I was making out with him at the back of his car.



The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.



He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.



Then, suddenly, the car stopped.



“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.



That’s when it all froze.



His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.



“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.



Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV



“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.



20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.



But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.



“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”



“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”



I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.



“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”



She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”



My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.



Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.



“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.



May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”



I gave her a weak smile.



Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.



“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.



I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.



She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.



“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”



“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.



“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”



She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.



“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”



I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.



“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”



I practically whispered his name.



Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.



May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”



“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”



She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”



“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”



“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”



“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.



Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.



What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?



“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”



“What?”



“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”



OKAY.



I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.



What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?



But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.



“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”



May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”



I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”



If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.



—



The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.



But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.



“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.



“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”



“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”



“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”



Misconduct?



What the freaking hell.



“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”



“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”



She handed me a printed sheet.



I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.



No freaking way.



Jace forged this.



“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”



Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”



I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”



“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”



Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.



“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”



“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.



Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”



“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”



HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”



“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”



She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”



“Let’s find out.”



I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.



I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.



Two guards stood by the elevator.



“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.



“Appointment?”



“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”



“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.



“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”



“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”



“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”



“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.



Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV



A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.



I looked up and my heart almost stopped.



Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.



“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.



“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”



“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”



HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.



A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.



“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.



I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.



He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.



It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.



Unease twisted my stomach.



“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.



He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”



“Oh, Oh…Right.”



I wanted to punch myself in the face.



The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.



“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.



I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.



He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.



“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.



He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.



“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”



“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.



My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”



“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”



The hiring department?



That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.



“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”



I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.



But he didn’t.



His gray eyes stayed emotionless.



“I’m sorry, Miss Collins,” he said quietly.



Tears rushed into my eyes. I couldn’t even breathe.



All I could think about were the bills, the debt, the mountain of shit waiting for me the second I left this building.



“If there’s nothing else, my assistant will show you out.” he said, reaching for the intercom.



I rushed forward and pressed my hand down on his before he could call anyone in.



His whole body stiffened—but he didn’t pull away. He just stared down at me. I stepped in closer, tilting my head up. His gray eyes darkened like a storm brewing in the distance.



His pine scent wrapped around me again, thick and intoxicating. As werewolves, our scent only spikes during a fight or sexual arousal. It was damn obvious which case this was.



“You clearly feel something for me,” I whispered.



He said nothing. I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heartbeat. It was racing as well. His breathing had also turned shallow.



“What are you doing, Miss Collins?” he asked tightly. “Trying to seduce your way into a job?”



“You can do whatever you want,” I locked eyes with him. “I won’t stop you.”



His Adam’s apple bobbed. God, I wanted to lick it.



And… well, I did.



I leaned up and pressed my lips to it. He let out a growl.



The next second, I was pinned on his desk. He stood between my spread legs, one hand by my head. I whimpered, clamping my thighs together—the heat between them was almost unbearable. Just like in the backseat of his car.



His hand slid from the desk to my throat. It was so big, he could probably snap my neck if he wanted.



“You shouldn’t keep tempting me, Miss Collins.”



His body was pressed against my thighs—I definitely felt the effect I was having on him.



“Why?” I whispered, licking my lips. “Because your self-control isn’t as strong as you thought?”



“Because I don’t fuck virgins.”



What the actual hell???



The next second, he had pulled away. I scrambled off the desk, face red, eyes wide.



“What did you just say?!” I snapped. “Why—How the hell do you even know—?”



“I know who you are. And I know about your relationship with my sister’s husband.”



And just like that, everything clicked.



It was Jace.



That bastard didn’t just dump me—he ran his mouth about my virginity to everyone, including Grayson.



Humiliation crashed over me like a wave.



“Jace is a fucking asshole,” I snapped shakily.



Grayson shrugged. “Obviously. But Brielle likes him. And he’s family now. I’m sorry but I just can’t get involved in this.”



I climbed off his desk with my whole body red and shaking.



He didn’t want me. And he was taking his sister and Jace’s side.



I was so damn stupid to think that one kiss in the car actually meant anything. But this was Grayson Hart for Christ’s sake. He could have anyone he wanted.



“I’m sure you’re a very capable employee, Miss Collins. But seducing me won’t help your career. I wish you all the best.”



He finally pressed the intercom button. His assistant appeared at the door, waiting for me to leave.



“Bye,” I whispered without even look back. I didn’t want him to notice my falling tears.



I walked out of that office, numb, and rode the elevator down like a ghost. My mind was a storm of bills, debt, and Grayson’s ice-cold stare. Now I desperately needed a new job.



“Miss Collins!”



I turned and saw his assistant come rushing out again, holding an envelope.



“Alpha Grayson asked me to give you this,” she said, handing it over.



“What is it?” Why didn’t he give it to me earlier?



“He didn’t say. Maybe you’ll know once you open it.”



She gave me a mysterious smile and walked away.



I opened the envelope. A blank check slid out first—I held my breath in shock.



Then I found a crumpled note. His handwriting, rushed and messy.



Haven’t repaid you for the shirt. Hope everything works out for you Aria. Stay strong. —Grayson



Chapter 5 Getting My Attention

Aria’s POV



“That check clearly means something,” May insisted.



“Come on. We’re not doing this again,” I sighed.



“If he’s not into you, then why did he give you that check? He probably saw you crying and couldn’t stand it. You should definitely go back and see him again.”



“Nope,” I shut it down immediately. “I had one perfect, fairytale encounter with a rich bachelor. That’s enough. I’m not about to go back there and humiliate myself all over again.”



“But—”



“Hey, you two!” our manager yelled from the other end of the aisle. “Less talking, more working!”



We rolled our eyes at each other and got back to inventory.



May had helped me land this supermarket job.



It was part of a chain under a big corporation, so the pay and benefits weren’t bad. May still thought it was beneath someone with my degree, but honestly, I was just grateful to be employed.



Once we finished our section, the manager wandered off to shout at someone else, and May scooted back over to me.



“Just imagine it,” she grinned. “You could write a couple million on that blank check and…BOOM! Instant rich girl life.”



“I’m not gonna do that.”



“Sure you won’t. You’re too nice,” she muttered, half-admiring, half-scolding. “So? What are you gonna write?”



I hesitated.



At first, I actually considered writing the price of a shirt. 19.99 that was. Because apparently, my dignity still thinks it matters.



But let’s be real, Grayson wasn’t just paying me back for a ripped tee, or he would’ve simply handed his assistant a $20 bill.



Maybe… he felt bad I lost my job too.



“I’m going to write the amount I should’ve gotten in severance,” I admitted eventually.



May's eyes bulged. “That’s it?!”



“I know it’s not much, but it’s what I actually deserve. And it’ll help me cover 2 months of bills.”



May sighed and looked at me like I was the biggest idiot alive. But my mind was made up.



I just wanted to walk away from the mess as quickly as possible. I still wanted to rip Jace’s smug face off, but the best revenge right now was surviving.



6 hours later, we finally finished our shift, exhausted and aching.



Everyone else got to clock out, but not me. I’d volunteered for night shift and closing duties.



The staffs left one by one, yawning, including May. Finally I was alone in this big market.



Now here’s the big secret—



I actually lived here now.



Nobody knew this, not even May.



She thought I’d found a new apartment and moved out, but I just couldn’t keep bothering her anymore. Her roommates were getting irritated with me hogging the living room and utilities.



And renting my own place seemed way out of budget now.



So I stayed in this supermarket instead.



I closed up the store at night and opened it early in the morning. For the 5 or 6 hours in between, I made a bed out of my coat and slept on the floor near the refrigerated section.



Now don’t ask me why I can’t sleep in the staff’s break room. That room was too hot without AC. At least it was cool by the freezer.



Tonight I was extra exhausted. The manager made us girls haul too many heavy crates around. I fell asleep on the floor in seconds.



It felt like I’d only been asleep for 5 minutes. My alarm hadn’t even gone off yet.



And I was jolted awake by someone screaming:



“—OH MY GOD! What the hell are you doing?!”



I shot upright, still half-asleep.



And I froze.



In front of me stood an entire group of people. Including the manager and several guys in suits. They were all staring at me wide eyes.



And I was only in a tank top and shorts. Half naked.



OH GOD.



What the hell…Is it morning already?!



Why didn’t I hear my alarm?



I scrambled to pull my clothes over my body, my hands shaking.



The stares didn’t stop. They got more invasive.



“Aria Collins! What the fuck are you doing?!” the manager stormed over and roared. “Napping half-naked in my fucking store?! Are you a fucking sex perv?!”



My face went beet red, “No! I—I was just staying here temporarily—”



“Temporarily?!” he yelled, eyes bulging. “I hired an employee, not a fucking squatter! How much water and electricity have you used free?! Have you been stealing food too?!”



“No I swear! I shut everything off when I’m done, I don’t use the water unless I have to…And I paid for everything I’ve eaten!”



Tears blurred my vision as I tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening. His spit actually hit my cheek as he snarled.



“Of all days—you had to pick the day corporate shows up to camp out in my perfect store. You filthy, disgusting little—”



“Aria Collins?”



A new voice called my name. It came from one of those suited men.



I looked up. And my heart dropped.



God I knew this guy. I think his name is Jonathan. A former coworker of mine from Apex.



“Holy shit, it is you,” he grinned in surprise, raising his brows. “Almost didn’t recognize you at first.”



“You… what are you doing here?” I stammered.



“Apex owns this supermarket chain. We’re doing site inspections today,” he said with a smirk, his eyes trailing down to my bare legs. “Man! Most people hit rock bottom after getting fired from Apex, but you fall faster than anyone.”



“I’m working. Making a decent living,” I said in shaky voice. “There’s no shame with that.”



“Oh really?” he sneered. “Does your job include lying around half-naked on the floor? What is this, a new hooker gimmick?”



The suits burst out laughing. My furious tears were on the verge of falling.



“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll fire her right away.” The manager groaned.



“Hold up,” Jonathan drawled with a smirk. “This chick got fired from Apex for messing up a seven-figure deal. You might wanna check your inventory. She could be stealing.”



I was furious. “You know that’s a lie! Jace made it all up. I never made a single mistake at work—”



“Oh please,” he cut me off. “Everyone in the industry knows how you fucked up. Jace was so embarrassed that he had to apologize to all the customers for you.”



The manager grabbed my wrist. “Then you’re definitely stealing from this market as well. That’s it. You are going to jail. When I figure out what you’ve taken, you must pay back everything!”



My heart pounded in my chest.



I didn’t doubt for a second that the manager would come up with something that I didn’t steal, just like how Jace framed me before. It wasn’t hard for guys like them.



But I couldn’t go to jail.



My grandma had no one to count on but me. I can’t leave her.



I knew what I had to do.



The wolf in me surfaced up the next second. I snarled at the manager, yanked my arm free, and ran.



“Stop her!” someone shouted behind me.



I had no idea where I was going. I just fucking ran. Desperate and horrified.



At the door, I slammed right into someone coming in.



“Get away from Alpha!” a bodyguard barked.



I staggered back in panic. But a large hand caught my wrist, steadying me.



“Aria?”



I looked up, still shaking involuntarily.



God, it’s indeed him! I couldn’t believe he’s here.



There’s a tight furrow between Grayson’s brows as he checked me up. Then he quickly unbuttoned his coat and wrapped me in, covering my half-naked body.



“It’s OK.” his voice was deep with clear hint of rage.



I clutched his shirt, gasping for air.



But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to breathe at all. Tears streamed down my cheeks.



“She’s having a panic attack,” a woman said nearby. “Alpha, if I may—”



I silently prayed him not to hand me over. And he didn’t.



“It’s fine, Nova. She stays with me,” he refused. “Aria. Breathe.”



Panicked footsteps echoed behind us. Jonathan’s voice rang out, stunned:



“Alpha Grayson! W-What’s going on here?!”



“Nova,” Grayson said in a cold, dangerous voice, “Stay here. Don’t let anyone leave.”



“Yes, Alpha.”



He scooped me up like I weighed nothing, one arm under my legs, the other around my back. I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck.



Then he carried me through the astonished crowd, into the store, and found a private room.



“You’re safe here,” he said after he shut the door.



That’s when I broke down. Crying out loud.



Fear, shame, panic—everything spilled out in a messy, helpless flood.



I clutched his wrist like it was the only thing keeping me from falling apart. He didn’t pull away.



I cried for 10 minutes straight He waited for my sobs to quiet down.



“Th-thank you…I’m better now.” I sniffled eventually.



He wiped a tear from my cheek with his thumb. I shivered at the way he touched my skin.



“You are always a mess when I find you,” he said. “Why is that?”



“I don’t know…Fate?” I choked.



He let out a dark chuckle. “This is not good.”



“W-Why?” I didn’t mean to be miserable all the time.



His voice was low, rough, and strained.



“Because it’s getting harder and harder for me to leave you like this,” he said.

1mrebgc,https://i.redd.it/94i4a5rcr9jf1.png,My V-card for Daddy's Friend,"chapter 1

POV Mikaela

There's a special circle of hell called ""turning twenty-two at Le Bernardin while Manhattan's elite assess your market value.""

I'm the birthday girl who gets no wishes, no song, no candles.

Just appraising glances from people who think my virginity is still a commodity worth investing in.

Twenty-two and never been fucked, and not just literally, but figuratively too. Because daddy's security team has cockblocked every potential experience since puberty hit.

The irony? I probably know more about sex than half of these married socialites, thanks to the Kindle stashed inside my hollow copy of ""Women in Economics.""

Three hundred and twelve steamy novels later, and I'm still trapped in this display case, untouched and pristine like some collector's item nobody's allowed to play with.

That's when I see him—a man I've never spotted at my father's gatherings before.

Dark hair kissed with silver, jawline sharp enough to slice through bullshit, watching the room with barely concealed disdain.

He's older, maybe late thirties, but radiates something these other corporate zombies lack: actual fucking life force.

His eyes meet mine for exactly three heartbeats, and the oxygen molecules between us spontaneously combust.

Before I can process what just happened, he's standing, murmuring something to my father, then striding toward the exit with his phone pressed to his ear.

Emergency call or convenient escape?

Either way, he's gone, leaving me weirdly breathless and suddenly aware of how boring everyone else is.

""Smile, Mikaela,"" mother hisses through her veneers. ""The Andersons are watching.""

Watch me perform my greatest trick: transforming into Perfect Daughter™ in 0.5 seconds.

Eyes warm but not inviting. Smile pleasant but not provocative. My emerald dress (mother-selected, obviously) shows just enough skin to prove I have it, not enough to suggest I might enjoy using it.

I'm basically a walking prospectus with tits—amazing potential returns, minimal risk, zero agency.

""Christ, these people's egos are so massive they should charge them for extra seating,"" Josie muttered, barely moving her lips behind her glass. ""Happy birthday, by the way. How's it feel having your special day weaponized into a networking event?""

A laugh shot up my throat that I suffocated into a polite cough.

Josie had saved my sanity since prep school, the only human who could x-ray through my perfect-daughter bullshit and see the handcuffs underneath.

""Mrs. Wallace, you've done a remarkable job with your daughter,"" said Mr. Covington. ""Such poise, such grace. They don't make young ladies like this anymore.""

I felt my soul crumble a little more as mother beamed. ""Thank you, Edward. We've always believed proper upbringing is essential.""

*Proper upbringing.*

As if my life had been anything other than a carefully curated performance to reflect well on Gunther Wallace's empire.

I'd never dated, never attended a school dance, never worked. I'd been dressed, educated, and molded into the perfect accessory.

**Perfect virgin-wife material.**

""Excuse me,"" I murmured, standing abruptly. ""I need to freshen up.""

The restaurant bathroom was mercifully empty when I pushed through the door, gripping the marble countertop as I stared at my reflection.

Behind me, the door banged open.

""You're about thirty seconds from a full psychological break in Chanel,"" Josie announced.

""I'm suffocating,"" I whispered, voice splintering like cheap glass. ""Twenty-two fucking years and I've never breathed non-filtered, non-approved air. My birthday gift? Not even actual stock certificates—just a goddamn trust fund statement for money I can't touch until I'm practically menopausal.""

""Listen up,"" Josie leaned in, all business. ""Tomorrow night, I'm kidnapping your ass. We're hitting real clubs with real music and real humans who don't calculate bloodlines before making eye contact.""

For one electric second, I saw it—freedom sprawled before me like some wild, unmapped continent.

My chest constricted with a want so savage it felt like cardiac arrest.

Then reality crashed down like a designer anvil. Two decades of premium conditioning crushed that spark with terrifying efficiency.

""I can't,"" I whispered, hating the wobble in my voice, hating more the sick relief underneath my disappointment. ""Remember last time? The security team? The financial guillotine?""

My fingers whitened against marble, bones threatening to pierce skin.

""Coffee tomorrow. Somewhere sanitized.""

Josie's expression collapsed, and there it was—the thing I couldn't stomach—pure fucking pity. She grabbed my hand; I let her, shame scorching me alive.

""Sure, coffee works,"" she said gently, which was somehow worse than anger. She understood my pathetic surrender without judgment, a kindness I hadn't earned.

When we rejoin the table, I freeze.

The mystery man is back, now seated at my father's right hand.

Up close, he's even more devastating—confident in a way that comes from actually living life instead of just accumulating wealth.

""Ah, Mikaela, there you are,"" my father says, irritated by my absence. ""I'd like you to meet Caleb O'Brien, an old friend and business associate of mine. Caleb, my daughter.""

So that's who he is.

The pieces click into place as I note my father's hand clapping Caleb's shoulder—a gesture of familiarity rarely extended in Father's tightly controlled world.

Though clearly younger than my father by several years, the subtle lines around Caleb's eyes speak of experience, of a life fully lived beyond boardrooms and balance sheets.

God, he’s gorgeous.

Caleb stood, towering at least ten inches above me. He extended a hand, his voice low and confident.

""Hello, Mikaela. Last time I saw you, you were in pigtails hiding behind your mother's legs. I have to say, the years between then and now have been... generous.""

His eyes swept over me—not crude, but thorough. Like he was cataloguing every detail, every change from that pigtailed kid to whatever I'd become.

For exactly three seconds, he looked at me like a man looking at a woman who claimed his attention.

Then he caught himself. Blinked. Shifted back into polite family friend mode so smoothly I almost convinced myself I'd imagined it.

*Almost.*

My hand trembled in his for the briefest moment, heat crawling up my neck at the simple contact and his compliment.

""Thank you,"" I murmured.

But I couldn't stop looking at him. Throughout dinner, my eyes kept finding their way back to Caleb.

Every smile, every low rumble of his laugh, every glance in my direction made my chest tighten in unfamiliar ways. He wasn't trying to belong, he simply did.

""She's been raised properly,"" Mr. Hennington was saying. ""A real lady. The kind of girl who understands her place in society.""

I felt my smile calcifying on my face as I nodded graciously, dying inside.

""If another man calls you 'a real lady,' I'm baptizing him with Cabernet,"" Caleb murmured, mouth dangerously close to my ear.

A strangled laugh escaped me—social suicide—triggering my mother's laser-beam glare. Caleb's eyes crinkled at the corners, fucking delighted by my lapse.

Later, during an excruciating conversational drought, he leaned in again. ""These corporate feeding frenzies—your thing?""

My lips twitched, still high from his earlier rebellion. ""Only when I'm the prize being auctioned off,"" I deadpanned.

Caleb burst into a surprised laugh, genuine and warm. It was the first time anyone at the table had reacted to me as more than a trophy.

The moment hung between us, electric but brief.

When Father stood, champagne flute in hand, I finally relaxed. Birthday toast, perfunctory acknowledgment of my existence, then dessert and freedom—at least the limited version available to me.

""I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on this special occasion,"" Father began, his commanding voice silencing all conversation. ""Today we not only celebrate my daughter's twenty-second birthday but also a momentous announcement.""

I froze, confusion replacing relief.

""It gives me great pleasure to announce the engagement of my daughter, Mikaela, to Anthony Harris, heir to Harris Financial. Our families will be united this fall in what promises to be the social event of the season.""

The world tilted sideways.

Engagement? Anthony Harris? I'd never even met him.

As applause erupted around me, I turned slightly to my right where Caleb sat beside me.

The proximity was sudden torture, every molecule between us charged with something I couldn't name but felt like drowning.

His smile was gone, replaced by a jaw clenched tight enough to crack stone. His grip on the wine glass was so severe I could see the blood retreating from his knuckles, leaving them bone-white against the crystal.

Something dark and unforgiving flickered in his eyes when he looked at my father as if he saw him for the first time, before they met mine.

A flash so brief I might have imagined it, but it seared through the numbness spreading inside me like a poison.

At that moment, I realized I wasn't just a daughter.

I was a commodity which had just been sold.

chapter 2

The room spun around me, faces blurring into a single, approving mass.

Only my mother remained in focus, silently warning me not to crack, not to shatter the pristine veneer we'd spent a lifetime polishing.

""What a brilliant match, Gunther,"" Mr. Henderson said, clapping my father on the shoulder. ""The Wallace and Harris dynasties united. Brilliant strategy.""

*Strategy.*

As if my life were nothing but a corporate merger. My body the fine print of a contract I never signed.

""You're a lucky girl, Mikaela,"" Mrs. Covington gushed, her diamond bracelet catching the light as she reached for my hand. ""Anthony Harris is only three years your senior—handsome, Harvard Business School, and heir to one of the most prestigious investment firms in the country.""

I forced my lips into the shape of gratitude while inside, something primal clawed at my ribcage, desperate for escape.

""How… fortunate,"" I managed before taking a sip of my wine, the words tasting like ash.

Across from me, Josie's usual sharp wit had dulled to a silent try of comfort.

Her eyes met mine, a brief connection in a world suddenly tilted on its axis. I watched my parents lean toward her, their voices lowered but not enough.

""She'll thank us eventually,"" my mother whispered, her smile smug with satisfaction. ""Some girls search their whole lives for what we've handed Mikaela on a silver platter.""

Every word sank into my flesh like tiny hooks, pulling me apart cell by cell.

I wondered if it was possible to disappear while everyone watched.

To dissolve into the expensive air of this restaurant and float away, leaving nothing but an empty emerald dress in my place.

""I believe it's time we call it a night,"" Father announced, rising from his chair with the authority of a man accustomed to ending conversations at his convenience.

""Caleb, you'll stay at the estate tonight. We have much to discuss in the morning.""

I hadn't known Caleb would be coming home with us.

The knowledge sent a strange current through my veins—fear and anticipation twisted into something I couldn't untangle.

In the car, silence wrapped around us like a shroud.

Caleb sat in the passenger seat beside our driver, while I was sandwiched between my parents in the back.

Father's voice sliced through the quiet, each word another brick in the wall he'd built around my existence.

""Excellent evening, wouldn't you say? The announcement was received perfectly. The Harris family will be pleased.""

Mother nodded. ""The fall wedding will be magnificent. September light is the most flattering for photographs.""

They discussed my life as if I weren't there, as if I were a project to be managed rather than a person with a beating heart.

I stared at the back of Caleb's head, at the way his dark hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck.

Once, his eyes caught mine in the rearview mirror, and something electric passed between us—a current of mutual recognition, of understanding.

The connection broke when he looked away, and I felt its loss like a physical pain.

The estate loomed before us, a monument to wealth disguised as a home.

In the grand foyer, Father summoned the staff with a snap of his fingers.

""Show Mr. O'Brien to the blue guest suite. Give him whatever he requires.""

Caleb thanked them with a warmth my father never showed the staff. Before following them upstairs, he turned to me, his gaze lingering for a fraction too long.

Something unspoken passed between us—a silent acknowledgment of the storm brewing beneath the surface of this perfect tableau.

I watched him ascend the staircase, my eyes tracing his movements until he disappeared from view. Taking with him some vital element I hadn't known I needed until it was gone.

""Goodnight,"" Father said curtly, already turning away, Mother a shadow at his heels.

The dismissal ignited something in me—a spark of defiance I'd suppressed for twenty-two years.

""I need to talk about this engagement,"" I said, my voice low but sharp enough to cut glass.

They froze, twin statues of privilege and power.

Mother turned slowly, fear flickering across her face like a candle in the wind. Father's expression darkened, thunderclouds gathering on the horizon of his features.

""We're not having this conversation in the hallway,"" he snapped. ""Both of you—my study. Half an hour.""

Thirty minutes later, I sat rigid in one of the leather chairs facing my father's imposing mahogany desk.

Mother perched beside me, her posture perfect even in her discomfort.

Father paced behind his desk, each step a threat.

""Your attitude is not just disappointing, Mikaela, it's ungrateful,"" he began, his voice a scalpel cutting through any illusion I had of being heard. ""And Camille, your failure to properly instill respect in our daughter is evident tonight.""

Mother flinched as if struck, but remained silent.

""Do you have any idea how fortunate you are?"" he continued, stopping pacing.

He was now pointing at me with a finger that had crushed business rivals without remorse.

""The Harris family is our equal—strong, traditional, powerful. They want their son to marry a woman who embodies their values. A pure, virgin woman from a respectable family, raised with discipline and honor. You fit that mold perfectly.""

The word ‘virgin’ in my father's mouth made me want to claw my skin off.

That my purity was a selling point in this transaction twisted something deep inside me.

""This arrangement isn't just a marriage, it's a statement. A model for what family should still mean in this broken world.""

His words settled in the room like lead, heavy and poisonous.

""And let me be absolutely clear: if you fail to fulfill your part of this agreement in four months, if you try to run, refuse or rebel, you will be cut off completely. No trust fund. No credit cards. No apartment. No name. Nothing. You'll learn what life looks like without the Wallace name to protect you. Because beyond this role, Mikaela, you have nothing. There is no other future waiting for you out there.""

Each syllable drove deeper into my chest, puncturing the fragile bubble of hope I'd been nurturing.

But beneath the fear, something else stirred—a fury so pure it burned away the edges of my learned helplessness.

""I've been the perfect daughter,"" I said, my voice trembling not with fear but with rage. ""I've followed every rule, kept every appearance. And still, I'm not allowed to choose my own life?""

Father's laugh was devoid of warmth, a sound made of ice and contempt.

""Your mother and I had an arrangement too, and we built a life others envy. You're lucky to follow in our footsteps!""

A bitter truth crystallized in my mind as I turned to Mother.

Really seeing her for the first time—the careful makeup that couldn't quite hide the emptiness in her eyes, the practiced smile that never reached beyond her lips.

""And are you happy, Mom?"" The question emerged, razor-sharp and unavoidable. ""Because from where I stand, you don't look happy. You look trapped.""

Mother's eyes widened, the careful mask slipping to reveal raw terror beneath—not at my words, but at the truth they exposed.

The truth she'd spent decades burying beneath designer clothes and society smiles.

Before Father could respond, she rose from her chair in one fluid motion and struck me across the face with an open palm.

The crack echoed through the room like a gunshot.

My head flew to the side, my hand flying to my burning cheek when the metallic taste of blood bloomed where my teeth had cut the inside of my mouth.

But it wasn't the physical pain that stunned me into silence—it was the betrayal in that single, violent act.

Twenty-two years of complicity, of silent acceptance, concentrated into one searing moment of truth.

In my mother's eyes, I saw not anger, but terror.

The terror of a woman who recognized her own reflection in a daughter who dared to speak what she had never been brave enough to acknowledge.

chapter 3

""There's no place for physical violence in this house,"" my father said, his voice cold with displeasure.

The irony was so bitter I could taste it along with the blood inside my mouth.

""Yeah, only emotional apparently,"" I muttered, the words slipping out before I could swallow them.

Father's jaw tightened, but he directed his attention to my mother instead.

""Take care of her. Make sure her face stays perfect.""

The study door clicked shut. Mother straightened her blouse, eyes scanning my face with clinical detachment.

""Get ice for that mark."" No apology, no tears—just damage control for damaged merchandise.

I nodded, another perfect, obedient response from the perfect, obedient daughter.

As we separated in the hallway, the truth crystallized like ice in my veins: she wasn't trapped in this gilded cage with me, she was one of the zookeepers.

Her manicured hands held the same keys as father's, just wore prettier gloves while turning them.

What I needed was something cold—for my face, for my heart, for the realization that I was completely alone. I made my way downstairs, careful to avoid the creaking floorboards that might alert the house to my wandering.

The kitchen light was already on when I rounded the corner, and I stopped short, my breath catching in my throat.

Caleb sat at the island counter, scrolling through his phone with casual ease.

He'd changed from his formal attire into sweatpants and a fitted t-shirt that clung to the contours of his wide muscular chest and shoulders in a way that made my mouth go dry.

The domesticity of the scene, this powerful man in simple house slippers, relaxed in our kitchen, created an intimacy I wasn't prepared for.

My body reacted before my mind could intervene, a flush creeping up my neck that had nothing to do with my injury.

He looked up immediately, his expression shifting from surprise to concern in an instant.

""What happened to your face?"" he asked, already moving toward me.

Before I could respond, he was in the freezer, pulling out a pack of frozen berries.

His movements were efficient, purposeful. One hand guided me to the stool he'd just vacated, the other gently pressed the makeshift ice pack against my burning cheek.

The cold relief was immediate, but it was nothing compared to the jolt that ran through me at his touch—careful, tender, concerned.

Our eyes met, and something unspoken passed between us.

I wondered if he could feel my pulse racing beneath his fingertips, if he knew that my breath had shortened not from pain but from his proximity.

""Do you want to talk about it?"" he asked, his voice low and steady.

I looked away, unable to bear the intensity of his gaze. ""No.""

My mind swirled with confused emotions. I tried to recall a single instance when my father had shown me the kind of immediate care that Caleb just had.

The blank space where those memories should have been yawned inside me like an abyss. But what disturbed me most wasn't the absence of fatherly care in my life.

It was that I didn't want Caleb to be fatherly at all.

The feeling coursing through me wasn't daughterly gratitude, but something far more dangerous—curiosity. Attraction.

A visceral pull toward him as a man who saw me, who responded to my pain with gentleness instead of calculation.

I fought to banish the thought, ashamed of its persistence.

""It'll be gone by morning,"" Caleb said softly. ""The mark.""

I looked back at him and smiled, a real smile, unguarded and genuine.

Something shifted in his expression, a flicker of emotion quickly masked.

He swallowed visibly, and I felt a surprising surge of power at having affected him.

Desperate to break the tension crackling between us, I asked, ""So... what kind of business do you have with my father?""

Caleb hesitated, his expression tightening momentarily before relaxing into something more vulnerable.

""Your father and I... we were close, once. Good friends, not just business partners. But something happened years ago put a strain on that. We haven't really spoken since.""

I watched him closely, sensing the weight behind his words. The careful editing of a story too complex for casual sharing.

""I'm here now,"" he continued, ""partly for business... but also because I want to fix what I broke. I'm hoping there's still a friendship worth saving.""

His honesty disarmed me.

I wanted to ask if he was a good man, if I could trust the strange feelings he stirred in me.

Instead, I just asked, ""Is that why you're not sleeping?""

He nodded, his lips curving slightly.

""That, and some messages I didn't have time to reply to during your birthday dinner.""

I laughed softly, the sound strange to my own ears after so much tension.

""Sorry for the disruption.""

His smile widened. ""It's alright.""

The cold pack had warmed against my skin, but neither of us had moved to adjust it. His hand remained gentle against my face, the point of contact between us charged with something I didn't dare name.

""This should be enough,"" he finally said, pulling away and returning the pack to the freezer.

When he turned back to me, his expression had softened into something that made my chest ache.

""Happy birthday, Mikaela.""

The simple wish, delivered with such genuine warmth, struck me more deeply than any formal toast or expensive gift.

I didn't know what to say, so I said nothing, letting the silence between us speak the words I couldn't form.

After he left, I lingered in the kitchen, my cheek still tingling—from the cold or from his touch, I couldn't tell. My body felt like a stranger's, alive with sensations I'd never allowed myself to acknowledge.

Sleep came in restless fragments that night.

My dreams are a confusing blur of people and feelings—my father's cold ultimatum, Caleb's gentle hands...

Then the nightmare fractures, and suddenly it's just Caleb.

His fingers no longer pressing frozen berries to my cheek but tracing fire down my neck instead.

Dream-logic shifts the kitchen to a bedroom I've never seen but somehow recognize as his. The night air feels electric against my bare shoulders.

""You deserve better,"" dream-Caleb whispers, his mouth dangerously close to my ear, sending ripples of heat spiraling down my spine.

His reverent hands are everywhere, the antithesis of everything I've been taught about men and their desires.

I arch against him, greedy and unrestrained in a way waking-me could never be. Here, in this nocturnal fantasy, I'm not anybody's precious commodity or careful investment.

I'm just wanted. The distinction breaks something open inside me.

When I wake, sheets twisted around my legs, my skin feels simultaneously too tight and too sensitive. The ghost of his touch lingers like a question I'm finally brave enough to ask.

There, on my nightstand, sat an exquisite bouquet of flowers. Fresh. Vibrant. Beautiful.

I blinked, startled into full wakefulness. My heart quickened as I sat up and reached for them.

For the past 2 weeks, my tongue has been itching, burning stinging, and has subtle white on it. My girlfriend just was told from her doc she has a positive yeast infection, so I figure I have oral thrush. I went to the urgent care and was prescribed with an anti-fungal mouthwash. I accidentally took most of it in one swish, so I was only on it for a day and a half. The feeling on my tongue still lasts after. From the urgent care, a swab came back negative for thrush. No STI's from urine sample. I brush my teeth and tongue 2 times a day and have a good diet and drink water. My tongue feels like I burned it on hot coffee constantly and today still looks like this [PICTURES](https://imgur.com/a/LJnj0o7) 

Not sure what to do. Should I go back and ask for another swab since it has been feeling worse since my first one? I'm not sure if this is paranoia or anxiety but my whole body has been itching for the past couple days too, and I don't want to give anybody anything so I've been quarantining.

Another piece of maybe coincidental info... The first time my tongue started feeling fuzzy was 2 weeks ago I had a SMALL sip of very strong spicy yuzu sauce at a sushi restaurant and it made my tongue feel fuzzy, still hasn't stopped since I suppose but I figured this a coincidence and it must be something else?

Am I… the last to know?! 😳

I literally stumbled into the rabbit hole, and my phone is blowing UP with crazy notifications—and a balance that’s not just coffee change. I'm hyped and kind of mad I wasn’t doing this sooner.

Before you start thinking this is sketchy or it’s too late, LET ME TELL YOU:  
2025 is the easiest year so far to get in. Tech companies are BEGGING people to run their stuff, and the payout is getting insane. I'm talking real money, gift cards, early access, you name it. If you’re not jumping on this, idk what to tell you.

So buckle in, fam, because these are my TOP 7 legit apps actually paying normal folks (not bots) to test new features RIGHT NOW👇

- ***1. GoodNovel TestApp***:  
I legitimately thought this was just for readers (like Wattpad vibes?), but NO. You test new features, give feedback, and get crazy rewards. Plus, you get to see stories/apps BEFORE everyone else. I wish I'd started with ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** because my friend made $120 his first month. Still salty.

- ***2. UserTesting***:  
OG for a reason. Gives you tasks to test websites/apps—takes 5-20 min per session. Super simple, and the cash-outs are RELIABLE. These guys keep improving and NEED more testers for their new app features.

- ***3. BetaFamily***:  
Beta apps and games DROP EARLY here. Fast turnaround (sometimes in just one night lol), and payments hit fast. Can’t believe more people aren’t talking about it!  

- ***4. TryMyUI***:  
This is the one that shocked me! Their pay isn’t pennies—it’s $10 per test, more if you do longer reviews. It all adds up QUICK. Pro tip: mix it with ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** and thank me later.

- ***5. PlaybookUX***:  
App companies are using this for feedback constantly. Easiest sign-up ever. Legit payments. Even small feedback gigs pay out!

- ***6. uTest***:  
Hidden gem for the ambitious. They work with MAJOR tech brands and have features in beta nobody else has! You’re testing real-world tech before anyone even hears about it.

- ***7. Toluna Influencers***:  
Surveys, feature tests, opinions—it’s all on your phone. I banked Starbucks cards like crazy in my first week. This is life for anyone who always has opinions! Pair your haul with ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** and just... trust.

I genuinely CAN'T believe I got PAID to just tap around apps and barely even use my brain LOL.  
Anyone else actually making bank off these? Why did nobody post this here before? 😩

Here's my loop: GoodNovel’s ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** (max easy payout), then rotate through these while binging YouTube or late doomscrolling 😂

Stop letting tech companies test their features on bots when you could get PAY OUT instead!  
***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** ➡️ literally changed my side-hustle game.

Who’s tried any of these? Drop your experience below because SOME of these are too good.  
What app shocked you most? Let’s get PAID TESTING in 2025, y’all! 🚀

My grandma falls and hits her head in her bathroom.  She called my aunt to complain, feeling a little sore, but took some pain killers and sat down in her fave chair. To ease the sore head a bit and just calm down a bit before calling the doctor.  She never made it that fare. She dozed off in the chair, was found unresponsive 5 hours later by my uncle, she died this morning at the hospital at 3 am. She had a massive brain bleeding that had been bleeding for hours before she was found. She didn't suffer,  she simply just dozed off like falling asleep and never woke back up.  She had been put in a respirator at the hospital,  they couldn't operate her due to the location of the bleeding.

I couldn't be there and say goodbye😭. The drive was too far and too late at evening when my mom called, wouldn't be able to find anyone to look after the kids , since I would have needed my husband to drive me.. at 1 am they made a 3rd brain scan and at the 3rd scan she was basicly brain dead,  reflecting check, nothing. Mom and her siblings decided to unplug her. 

Sorry it's a sensitiv subject,  I have barely processed the fact that im pregnant with baby number 5 and then my grandma dies.

This week's has been some hell of a roller-coaster ride emotionally. And it's not over..im completely broken, I loved my grandma so much,  she would send me silly stickers,memes or selfies on messenger regularly.   Feels like the universe is testing me head on.. ""we gonna make sure you are keeping this baby we are giving you,  cuz we gonna hit you hard with grief"".  Like seriously universe?. 

I woke up today after crying my self to sleep, that it was all just a bad nightmare. Got up made coffee, then mom called and reality came crashing hard, no grandma dying wasnt a nightmare.   Comes in waves,  one sec i can laugh for a few sec cuz of some silly thing the cats or the dogs are doing.  Then 30 min later, i breakdown again,  full on cant breathe sobbing.

And that his mom is a little mentally ill and obsesses over the rapture and trump. First date guys. First date. I don’t even remember his name. I’m so overwhelmed. 

I told him, to try and relate and make him feel better, that my family sometimes fights over politics and it makes holidays less fun than it used to be, and that my little sisters getting depressed over her ex, so our relationship in adulthood has struggled some more than it used to because of him. But we are still close. That’s it. Seriously. Then he got taken aback like I over shared. Not being sarcastic. I thought he was joking. Wow. It was dessert by the time he got done talking and he was like “wow. That’s a lot to digest. Thank you for sharing all of that. Do you have friends who can help?”.

This year has been like this constantly with the guys I’m picking. Major over sharing and then disappearing when I talk. At all. Like they want a mannequin and that’s it. When am I going to win?!?",1,1755300810.0,dating,2,0.67,False
1mre68q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mre68q/aita_for_standing_up_to_a_friend_who_blindsided/,"AITA for standing up to a friend who blindsided me, then blocking him after he ended our friendship?","I (26M) met this guy (lets call him Lucas) last year in April at the library. We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I noticed how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often felt like debates (even when they didn’t need to be) and he always had to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

We got into a conversation about politics. He told me he was a DJT supporter and asked about my views, and I said I leaned Democrat. His response was, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to quantify it, but he insisted, saying, “I’m going to assume a lot then” and then started trying to convince me that I actually agree with him more than I realize. It didn’t feel like a respectful conversation (it felt like he was trying to invalidate my stance and manipulate the direction of the discussion).

The next day, I texted him and said I didn’t appreciate the way he dismissed my views and made assumptions about me. I said an apology would suffice, not in a confrontational way, just to express that I felt disrespected.

He said he doesn’t like texting and preferred to talk in person. When we met up, I bought him a coffee at Starbucks and we sat down on a sofa and the whole thing exploded. He said I was trying to bring him down to my level, accused me of having low self-esteem, called me controlling and untrustworthy, sounded like the devil and said I “love conflict"" and even said I was bullying him at a moment. It felt like he was unloading a bunch of resentment and going straight for personal attacks. I was stunned. I reminded him how much I’d supported him in the past (not to guilt him, just to show that I’ve always acted in good faith). He accused me of being manipulative and trying to make him feel bad for me.

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over,” and insisted on doing a prayer with me and I declined respectfully saying it wasn't about that. He got up and told me to hug him which I also declined but extended my hand to shake and he shook it then walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one last message and blocked him:

“I don’t feel bad about myself, Charles, nor do I have low self-esteem. I’m okay the way I am—even better than some people, to be honest.What really bothered me was how you turned a simple request into a character assassination.People make mistakes, including you—you even joke about them sometimes. But today you took things to a different level, throwing insults at me non-stop.I don’t deserve that kind of treatment. I’m not interested in being friends after this. Ciao for now.”

It's been 7 months of no contact but absolutely no one has sided with me out of the entire church I use to go to (I stopped going for 7 months now). AITA ?",1,1755300796.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

1mre2em,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mre2em/i_am_marrying_my_exs_fiancés_brother/,I am Marrying my Ex's Fiancés Brother,"Hello, petty potatoes. Charlotte, you're amazing, and I love this community. Never thought I'd be sharing so here’s my story, with real names. It's a bit long, so bear with me. So, as the title implies, I am marrying my ex-fiancé's brother. We’re getting married on August 23, and it’s been a long time coming. Now, you're probably wondering… WTF? Trust me, same here.

I’m Ava, 28, and I was supposed to marry my ex, Andrew, 29, when we were in university. We were 23 and 24 at the time. We had started dating our freshman year in college, so about 5 and a half years before he proposed. He had made me really happy because he was my almost-first everything. I was a shy girl when it came to dating in high school, so being with him felt like a dream come true. He was my first kiss, my first relationship—basically everything but sex.

At first, I just wanted to make sure I would stay with him longer than six months. However, close to the beginning of our relationship, my dad became ill. It was stage 4 skin cancer. It was a very difficult time for me, and the doctors were preparing us for the worst. (This is relevant later.) In many conversations I had with my dad, the topic came up, and my father asked if I could make a promise to him, because he wanted to remember his little girl this way. He always joked that I didn’t really have a boyfriend—just a five-year-old little girl who was playing pretend with her imaginary friend.

So, I kept my promise and told him I would wait until I was married. He died six months later. I miss my dad every day and keep his memory alive. It’s just my way of honoring him. After my father’s death, I told Andrew about my promise and even gave him an out. He said he understood and didn’t want an out, and he would wait until the day of our marriage. At the time, I didn’t believe him until he proposed years later.

Being with him felt like a fairy tale because I truly thought I had found ""the one."" When we got engaged, in the beginning, everything was easy. There wasn’t anything off or weird. We were still normal with each other—until one random night. We were making centerpieces for the wedding, and just a random conversation happened about love. I asked him, “How much do you love me?” He said, “I love that ass,” referring to my big butt. We always made jokes like that, but I wanted a real answer.

He had said “I love you” before, but after we got engaged, he hadn’t said it in about six months. I just needed some reassurance, and he got annoyed. He said, “Why do you want me to say it so bad? I’m marrying you, aren’t I?” I was confused, and his tone annoyed me over something so simple.

“Well, you just haven’t said it in a few months, and I just wanted some reassurance,” I said. He laughed at me, but it was a serious, sarcastic kind of laugh. “What do you think I’m marrying you for? You always f\*\*\*ing do this.” He got up, and his reaction took me by surprise, but I didn’t yell. I’m the type of person who doesn’t yell, even when I’m mad. He knows I don’t like being spoken to that way, so what happened was a mystery to me at the time.

“What do I always do?” I asked. “This. Ask dumb questions when we’re happy, and then you bring this up just because I haven’t said it. What do you think I think of you, as a random piece of ass?” I was taken aback and stood up. “Okay, where is this coming from? All I asked was a simple question, and you’re acting like a dramatic teenager.”

He just looked at me and started pacing. “I can’t do this right now,” was all he said before walking away. I stayed there, confused, wondering what that was about. I just went to the room and left it like that. It was about two hours later when he came to bed with me, hugged me, and apologized. He said he’d just had a bad day and took it out on me. We had a long conversation about it, how it wasn’t okay, and we moved on.

However, he started becoming a lot more passionate after getting engaged, and each time, I had to stop him. Normally, he would back down and apologize, but this time, he just smacked his lips and complained about how we were going to be married, so why did it matter? I just reminded him why it mattered to me, but he was acting as if I were just a random piece of ass. He got offended and started screaming at me, saying I was shallow and that how did he know I wasn’t after his money.

I didn’t yell. I didn’t scream. I didn’t say a word. I just got up, grabbed some clothes, and left. He didn’t even try to stop me. I stayed at a friend’s house for a week, but during that week, he never once called me. Honestly, after that reaction, I was considering postponing the wedding.

I did call his father, as he truly became a second dad to me after my dad passed away. He said he would talk to him, and he did. Two days later, Andrew came over to my friend’s house with flowers and apologized. We had a long conversation, and things were back to normal. We kept going with the wedding planning, and before we knew it, six months had passed, and we were at the rehearsal dinner.

It was perfect, until I found him. We were saying goodbye to everyone when suddenly he disappeared. Everyone had taken off, except for his brother, Adrien, and his parents, as we all came in the same car. So, we went to look for him. Adrien and I went to check the groom’s room at the venue. As we got closer to the room, we saw his phone on the floor, and his messages were open. I picked it up and started reading. To my surprise, it was him cheating.

It wasn’t just that he was cheating, but as I scrolled through the phone, I saw multiple women, and I found one of my bridesmaids' names. Yes, he was cheating with one of my bridesmaids. But that wasn’t even the worst part. I found a message that said:

“Do you actually believe she’s a virgin?”  
“I do. She made some promise to her old man. I don’t really know why she won’t just do it. He’s already dead. What the f\*\*\* does it matter?”  
“OMG, she’s so dramatic. Always has been since we met. Wait, so why are you marrying her?”  
“Yeah, honestly, we’ve just been together for so long. I just got used to it, and my parents like her so…”

Getting cheated on was one thing, but reading that message broke me. Here I thought a man who loved and wanted to spend forever with me could do something so vicious. At that point, I lost it, and so did his brother. Adrien was livid. I was crying, enraged, and I went straight to the groom’s room, where sure enough, he was there.

I opened the door to find him in the act with my bridesmaid. He panicked, tried to pull up his pants, and the bridesmaid tried to hide behind him. I started crying, threw the phone on the floor, and hit it with my shoe, cracking the screen. I told him the wedding was off and walked away. I could hear him trying to come after me, but Adrien grabbed him and just told him to let me go. They started arguing, and Adrien walked away with me.

We found his parents, dropped them off first, and Adrien drove me to my maid of honor’s house. He apologized to me, and I just smiled and thanked him. That would be the last time I saw Andrew, and it’s been three years.

I spoke to my family the next day, and his parents were fully supportive of my decision. They said they were disappointed that I wouldn’t be their daughter on paper, but I would always be their daughter. I have a really amazing relationship with them. Andrew tried to reach out to me, but I blocked him and cut him completely out of my life. I stayed in touch with his parents. I moved on with my life and went to therapy, where I realized how awful he was. There were so many red flags with him—those were just the moments where I started to question things.

Time passed, and three years later, I met his brother. I confused him for Andrew at first, since they were identical twins, except for a tiny mole on Adrien’s right eye, which was how we all told them apart. We were both at the same coffee shop, and I thought it was Andrew, but when I saw it wasn’t, I went up to greet him. Adrien had always been nice to me, and it felt nice to see him. We caught up, and I told him I was still in touch with his parents, so he invited me to dinner with his family that same night. It was like nothing had changed, well, almost nothing.

Can't blame a girl for having a type, right? Anyway, after dinner, we waved goodbye to his parents and went for a walk. We talked about so many things, and I honestly felt bamboozled. I swore if I thought I had it good with his brother, Adrian was nowhere near that. Oddly enough, something just felt right, but I didn’t want to admit it until he made his confession.

The way I met Andrew was actually the day I met Adrian first; I just happened to have met Adrian first. He told me he actually wanted to pursue me from the beginning, but once he realized his brother was into me, he backed off and moved on. However, his feelings lingered the more he got to know me, but he would never do that to his brother. That’s why he was so angry with him when he cheated on me.

I told him that if I would have met him first, the conversation would be very different right now, but there’s no point in dwelling on the past. We should just move forward. Little did I know, that was our first date. After that, we just kept talking and going on more dates. I really started to see a different side of relationships, and what I thought I had versus what I have now is nothing I could ever compare.

We’ve been dating for two years, but he proposed to me at 1.5 years because we both just knew. However, we kept our dating a secret from his brother. His parents and everyone in my life knew, except for him, as he was kicked out of the house and sent to live by himself. He moved to another state for a few years where he worked and has been there since. He only visits every now and again.

Us keeping it from him wasn’t out of pettiness or revenge—it was just because we were happy and wanted to keep it between ourselves. Well, he came to visit because Adrian’s parents thought it would be a good idea to tell him now, and we agreed. They called him, telling him to come visit since his brother is getting married and to make plans.

He came that weekend, and we let him settle in for a few days before I showed up to visit. I came over, and Jenna greeted me (the twins' mom), soon followed by Burt (the twins' dad), Adrian, and Andrew. When he saw me, it was as if he saw a ghost. He started cussing me out, asking why I was there and about to come up to me when Adrian stood in front of him. That’s when Andrew understood who he was marrying.

He started causing a scene, saying that he knew I always wanted to be with his brother and not him. And how he was right for cheating on me because ""I never loved him."" Adrian got in his face and started listing all the misdeeds he did to me and how I still forgave him. He said that Andrew’s insecurities were what failed him and that’s why he had a failed relationship with me.

Seeing how Adrian defended me honestly reassured me so much that I just wished I would have met him first. With Andrew fuming, Jenna took me into the kitchen to finish cooking while the three boys talked about it. It was dinner time, and we were setting up the table. We all gathered and started eating.

Adrian’s parents and I started a conversation as if nothing had happened. Andrew just slammed his hand on the table and yelled, ""Are you kidding me? You can't be serious?"" We looked at him confused, and he started going off, saying, ""How is this normal? This is so weird."" He then proceeded to say, ""I had intended on this night not only to share happy news with my brother, but happy news with you guys. I'm going to be a dad.""

We all sat in silence, not knowing how to respond. What I didn’t know at the time was that he was dating my ex-friend and bridesmaid. So everyone was hesitant about saying anything given who it was. All I said was, ""Congratulations. I hope you’re very happy.""

He asked me, ""Aren’t you jealous?"" Everyone looked at me, and I said, ""No, because I’m not. I had everything I deserved and wanted, and it wasn’t him."" He got mad and stormed off.

We finished dinner, I went home, and called Adrian. He told me that he worried Andrew might try to ruin the wedding, given everything that had happened. Right now, it's calm, but one of Andrew’s old friends called me last night. I thought he was going to bash me or something, but instead, he warned me that I should get security and have passcodes with vendors because Andrew might be planning something, and he disagrees with it.

He even apologized to me because he knew about his cheating and never spoke up due to ""bro code."" I forgave him and thanked him. I told Adrian, and he is just reassuring me that he won’t let anything happen to our special day. So that where we are today. The wedding is next week.

1mrdt3o,https://i.redd.it/erkupv3sn9jf1.png,"A Goddess In Disguise: Divorce, Marriage, Domination","Chapter 1 The Fake Daughter Loses Everything

""Mrs. Gibson, do you have anything to say about your husband showing up at Marilee Jenkins' birthday party today and announcing that he's going to divorce you?""



""People are saying Marilee is Mr. Gibson's first love and the real daughter of your parents, while you're the fake. You've been enjoying her parents' love all this time and married to the man meant for her. Do you feel bad about that?""



""Your parents just said you're not really their daughter and cut off your money. You've been out of work for two years, living as a housewife, so how exactly do you plan to support yourself now? Mrs. Gibson, any comments?""



The birthday party was crowded, and Alexia Gibson found herself completely trapped. 



Reporters quickly closed in on her, pushing cameras and microphones into her face as camera flashes burst from every direction, giving her no space to breathe. 



Alexia just stood there, frozen. Her mind was still spinning from everything she'd just heard. 



So this Marilee Jenkins was the real daughter of her so-called parents and her husband's true love. 



And her? She was Roger Gibson's wife on paper, but clearly, just a joke to everyone else. 



Years ago, the Jenkins couple had pulled her out of some run-down neighborhood overseas, saying she was their long-lost daughter. 



But had they really not bothered doing a simple DNA test before welcoming her in? 



Why did they only discover the mistake now? 



Alexia's body tensed up. Her eyes drifted over to the man standing next to her. However, Roger's attention was not on her. He was looking at Marilee, as if they were the only ones in the room. 



Her voice came out strained as she asked, ""Why? You didn't even tell me.""



Roger's face was as cold as stone. ""Now you know. That's all that matters. It's over, Alexia. You were never good enough for me. Our marriage? Just a transaction. The only woman I've ever loved is Marilee. And you know why I never touched you after the wedding? Because you disgust me. You're like a spoiled dish--completely unappetizing.""



His eyes swept over her from head to toe, full of scorn. Her simple clothes, those outdated glasses--everything about her clashed with the glossy, high-class world he lived in. 



Before his harsh words even fully sank in, Alexia lifted her glass and threw the champagne right into his face. 



The drink hit him with a loud splash, soaking his face and pricey suit. He just stood there, stunned, as the liquid dripped from his hair and down his face. 



""A spoiled dish? You told me you wanted an ordinary housewife. Dad and Mom told me they wanted an obedient daughter, who never outdid anyone!""



Without hesitation, she threw the glass to the floor. The sharp crash instantly silenced the whole room. 



Roger's face turned red with embarrassment. His jaw tightened. ""Have you lost your mind?""



From the stage, the Jenkins couple yelled at her. ""Alexia, this is Marilee's birthday, not a place for your drama!""



People in the crowd rolled their eyes and muttered that she was nuts. 



None of them had a clue what she had given up for the two families all these years. 



Shoving through the crowd, Alexia made a beeline for the exit. Reporters swarmed after her like a flood. 



She shoved past them all, blind to the pouring rain, deaf to the murmurs and judgment surrounding her. Right now, all she wanted was to get away--far from the noise, the eyes, and the humiliation. 



But just as she broke through the crowd and made it outside, a bunch of Marilee's wild fans shoved her hard, and she slipped, landing on the wet road. 



Marilee was an A-list star in showbiz. Her birthday party was being livestreamed, and tons of fans had gathered outside. The second they saw Alexia step out, the crowd lost it, shouting like wild animals who had just found something to attack. 



""Alexia, you've got some nerve attending Marilee's birthday party. You've got no shame!""



""You're not even the real daughter. Just go back to whatever dump you came from, or are you too hooked on the Jenkins' money?""



""Roger's going to divorce you, and you still think it's okay to show your face around Marilee? Who do you think you are?""



""Go away already!""



Alexia lay there on the wet street, frozen for a second, while their nasty words echoed all around her. 



She let out a dry, bitter laugh. Everything was such a joke. A broken marriage, a cold family, and now they'd left her completely humiliated. 



What was the point of pretending for so long? She had kept her head down, put up with everything, and this was what she got in the end? 



A wave of helplessness washed over her. She closed her eyes, not even caring anymore as the freezing rain drenched her. 



Through the noise and chaos, a flattering voice broke through. ""Mr. Mason."" The polite greeting was followed by firm, steady footsteps coming closer in the rain. 



Moments later, a black umbrella appeared above her, silently cutting through the rain and offering her shelter from the storm. 





Chapter 2 Meeting Him Again At Her Absolute Worst

Alexia slowly looked up and met a sharp, intense gaze. 



The streetlights flickered in the rain. Waylon Mason stood there, tall and intimidating, with a strong presence that made people uncomfortable. 



Behind him was a row of fancy cars parked along the street, catching everyone's eye. 



His assistants were standing on both sides of him, and one was holding an umbrella over his head. 



But the umbrella Waylon was holding was tilted just to cover Alexia. 



Waylon took a slow step forward and leaned in. Before she could react, his fingers reached up and removed the heavy, black-rimmed glasses from her face. Her bright, beautiful eyes were now fully visible. 



He looked down at her with a smirk. ""It's been years, Alexia. Look at you--what a mess. Did you finally stop being that love-crazy girl, or are you still dreaming useless dreams?""



Every word cut deeper. Alexia's eyes started to tear up, and the little bit of strength she had left broke down under his harsh voice. 



She opened her mouth to retort, but before she could speak, Waylon suddenly picked her up in his arms in front of everyone, protecting her from the rain and everything around them. 



He walked toward the black car waiting nearby, carrying her as the bodyguards quickly stepped aside to make way. 



All the noise and the rude comments around them faded away. 



Everyone just stood there, stunned, watching them leave with shock written all over their faces. 



...



Inside the car, Alexia held onto her muddy, soaked dress with trembling hands. 



She looked down, her voice rough. ""Waylon, why'd you have to show up now?""



Why now...when everything in her life was falling apart? 



Waylon tilted his head at her question, then reached out and took her chin in his hand, gently but firmly lifting her face. His voice was calm, yet carried a cold edge. ""Why else? I came to check on the woman I liked the least.""



His eyes darkened, a smirk playing on his lips. ""So, Alexia, do you remember what I said to you seven years ago?""



Of course she did. 



Waylon was the golden child of the Mason family. Her biggest rival back in the day. 



The last time they met was at the airport, seven years ago. What was meant to be a goodbye turned into their worst fight. 



Waylon always hated how she begged for the Jenkins family's approval and how she held onto Roger like she had no pride. And she couldn't stand his ego and how he judged everyone she cared about. 



Back then, he'd warned her clearly--chasing approval from people who'd never truly accept her would only end in disappointment, leaving her with nothing in the end. 



But she was too hopeful to see it. She had told herself, ""It's okay if they don't like me now. If I work hard and put them first, they'll accept me eventually.""



They wanted her to marry Roger, so she agreed. Her brothers didn't want her getting too powerful, so she acted clueless and average. But behind the scenes, she was quietly taking out their threats and protecting both the Jenkins and the Gibson families. 



As Waylon's fingers held her jaw tightly, her warm tears fell on his hand, running down his knuckles. His expression wavered. The coldness faded just for a second. Then, he let go. 



Alexia's voice shook, still raspy from the rain. ""Waylon, you were right. They tossed me aside after exploiting me. For more than twenty years, I gave them everything I had. I was so st\*\*id.""



It was a long time before Waylon finally spoke again. ""You were not st\*\*id. They just weren't worth it.""



But Alexia didn't respond. 



He turned to look at her and saw her fast asleep. 



Later that night, Alexia suddenly came down with a high fever. 



Santino Blake, Waylon's personal doctor, got pulled out of bed by a single call and had to grab his stuff and rush over late at night. 



With his years of experience, Santino quickly ran a full checkup. He stood by the bed, looking at Alexia's pale, tired face, and let out a soft sigh. 





Chapter 3 Our Luna Is Back

Santino glanced over his shoulder and caught sight of Waylon on the balcony, cigarette burning slowly between his fingers. 



Sm\*\*e curled up in lazy spirals, casting a ghostly veil over Waylon's sharp features, softening them with each exhale. 



Waylon rarely smoked. Santino could only recall one other time Waylon had smoked like this--two years ago. 



Santino stepped outside and joined him. ""She's stable now. She just picked up a chill from being stuck in the rain and took the shock pretty hard. I've given her an injection and some medication--she'll be all right.""



A brief pause allowed Santino to scan the night sky. ""I checked the headlines. The Jenkins family didn't just cut her off; they humiliated her for everyone to see--right in the middle of Marilee's birthday party.""



Anger edged into Santino's voice. ""Hadn't they done a DNA test before taking her back from abroad? This whole thing smells like a setup.""



A sudden vibration broke his focus--Alexia's phone was buzzing on the nightstand. 



Waylon strode inside, intent on ending the call, but the name flashing on the screen stopped him cold. A flicker of something dark flashed across his eyes as he picked up and put on the speaker. 



Shouting erupted instantly, the caller's anger unmistakable. 



""Alexia, you've ignored every call and message. What exactly are you trying to pull? Faking your own disappearance won't help. Tomorrow, you're signing the divorce agreement, and that's the end of it. I've shown enough patience. Stop standing in the way of Marilee and me. You've lived off the Jenkins family long enough. If you have any dignity left, walk away for good--it's the least you can do for Marilee. Don't worry about your share--you'll get what's coming. You looked after my grandmother and my mother these past years, fine. But don't overstep. Learn when to quit. Why aren't you answering me? Where are you?""



The stillness that lingered on the line finally made Roger uneasy. His confidence wavered and his words lost their edge. 



Santino internally begged for someone to step in and stop what was happening, feeling panic surge as things slipped further from control. 



From the moment Roger started speaking, Santino caught the way Waylon's face darkened. His eyes went cold and every hint of warmth vanished, leaving the atmosphere icy and suffocating. Santino could barely stand, knees threatening to give way. 



Waylon's expression turned sharp, his smile edged with cruelty. ""So that's the way you speak to her, huh?""



Every muscle in Roger's body tensed, instincts screaming a warning. His voice grew cautious. ""Who are you? Where is Alexia?""



Waylon let his gaze settle on the bed, where Alexia rested, her breathing faint but even. His response came as a gentle murmur, almost lost in the tension. ""She's asleep.""



He let a short silence hang before adding, ""And she's right here with me.""



The only thing that answered him was the explosive sound of rage through the phone. Roger's voice thundered down the line. ""What did you just say? Who are you?""



Amusement glimmered in Waylon's eyes as a low chuckle slipped out. ""Relax. You'll figure it out...assuming you live long enough."" Without another word, he ended the call. 



By morning, the rain had vanished, leaving sunlight streaming through the windows as Alexia stirred awake. 



She reached for her phone, greeted by a storm of missed calls and furious messages from Roger. 



Without reacting, she scrolled through the flood of texts, then let the device drop onto the sheets. Right now, a hot shower mattered more. 



Steam fogged the bathroom mirror as she faced her reflection. Something had changed--her eyes, once dull, now held a spark she hadn't seen in ages. 



For the first time in ages, she tried out a smile, and this one actually reached her eyes, genuine and alive. 



It felt like a fever had burned away all her confusion, stripping her heart of old pain and foolish loyalty to those who never deserved it. 



No more playing the fool. No more pretending everything was fine. This sad story was over. 



Wrapped in a towel after the shower, she scanned her contacts and paused on a name untouched for years. 



Her call barely rang once before chaos exploded on the other end. ""Luna! It's about d\*\*n time! Tell me--are the rumors true? You're finally getting a divorce?""



Laughter and shouting burst from the background, her friends making no attempt to hide their eavesdropping. 



Alexia replied calmly, ""Yes, I'm going to sign the divorce agreement today.""



Celebration roared through the phone. Whistles, cheers, the clink of glasses--her friends were clearly turning it into a full-blown party. 



""Took you long enough to snap out of that trance! No more housewife blues. Our Luna is back!""



""Divorce is the best thing to happen to you! Roger never deserved you. Say the word and I'll handle him myself!""



""And don't get me started on that overrated Jenkins family. If not for you, they'd have collapsed during last year's crash. Luna, we're ready when you are--the Helix Consortium stands with you.""



Their laughter and support brought a genuine grin to Alexia's lips. ""In that case, I need a ride.""



Without missing a beat, a man's voice broke in, buzzing with excitement. ""A ride? For your grand return? Name it. I'll send the reigning racing champion to pick you up!""





Chapter 4 Do You Believe Me

The call had barely ended when the soft click of the door caught Alexia's attention, her head snapping up. 



There in the doorway stood Waylon, his height casting a shadow, his expression giving nothing away as their eyes met. 



Neither of them had anticipated this kind of encounter. 



Fresh from the shower, Alexia's hair clung damply to her cheeks, a robe slipping low on her shoulders, skin flushed and eyes still hazy with warmth. 



That oversized bathrobe, threatening to slip further, revealed soft lines of skin; the faint scent of shampoo lingered in the air, sweet and impossible to ignore. 



Waylon's gaze swept over her, lingering just long enough for her cheeks to flush, before he looked away calmly. ""Get ready. Breakfast is on the table.""



Moments later, Alexia emerged dressed, met by the aroma of a beautifully arranged breakfast. Hunger won out over pride; she took her seat without pretense, finishing most of the meal before pausing for breath. 



Little was said as Waylon let her eat in peace, only breaking the silence after she'd nearly cleared her plate. ""You need a lawyer?""



She set down her coffee cup, eyes meeting his squarely. ""So you've heard.""



Amusement tugged at his mouth, though his eyes stayed cold. ""Is there anyone left who doesn't?""



Alexia tasted the bitterness of the coffee and grimaced for just a moment, though she quickly composed herself. ""I can deal with it.""



As the words left her mouth, she realized he might think she was too stubborn to admit she needed help. After all, in most people's eyes, women being dumped were pathetic. 



""Do you believe me when I say that?"" she asked. 



A smirk played on Waylon's face, eyes narrowing with a knowing glint. ""Why wouldn't I? Alexia, he's the one who should've fallen apart.""



That unwavering gaze held her still, though she managed a small, genuine smile in return. ""You've always known how to make a good point.""



Once breakfast was done, Alexia got ready to leave. 



Reaching the doorway, she stopped and glanced back. ""Thank you,"" she said quietly, her gratitude unmistakable. 



There was no chance she'd forget his kindness. 



...



Ten minutes had ticked past their appointment, and Roger's patience was quickly wearing thin as he and Marilee waited for Alexia in a private club. 



""Why isn't she here yet? Is she refusing to divorce you?"" Marilee pressed herself closer to him, sugar in her tone as she pouted. ""You haven't forgotten our shopping plans, right? You promised you'd buy me a gown after this.""



Roger hummed in response. The weekend's banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce would be the perfect stage to introduce Marilee--the timing of her comeback couldn't have been more ideal. Every influential name in town would be present, all eyes fixed on Waylon's much-anticipated return. 



Just thinking about Waylon sent a flicker of unease across Roger's face. 



The Chamber of Commerce's open support for Waylon right before the election of its new president wasn't exactly good news for the Gibson family. 



A sudden uproar near the doorway snapped Roger's focus. 



His head turned, and in that instant, it felt as though the atmosphere in the room shifted. 



Everyone's attention zeroed in on a single figure gliding inside with effortless grace. 



Alexia walked in, her crimson dress hugging every curve, heels whispering over the polished floor. Each stride radiated poise and quiet confidence. The scarlet hue, that unmistakable glow--she looked like the sunrise brought to life. 



With each step Alexia took, Marilee's smile grew tighter, until it disappeared altogether when Alexia claimed the seat across from them. 



Roger couldn't hide his shock either; his eyes remained glued to Alexia's artfully made-up features. 



""You..."" Words caught in his throat, visible in the small, nervous bob of his Adam's apple. 



Nobody present could believe this woman was the same person from last night--the awkward glasses, the baggy checkered shirt, the sopping hair. 



Yesterday's pitiful girl had been replaced by someone utterly different, confident, unrecognizable. 



Nothing about their surprise caught Alexia off guard. Her beauty wasn't news to her; she'd just chosen not to make a show of it. Childhood lessons had always emphasized modesty, staying out of the spotlight, never inviting too much notice. 



Marriage only tightened the leash. Years spent tending to Roger's grandmother and fielding disapproval from a mother-in-law who'd been fed tales of her so-called wild youth. 



Not even her hair or the color of her clothes escaped scrutiny. Every detail had been censored into drab submission. 



Vibrant dresses never made it to her closet--only baggy, forgettable options filled the shelves. 



That chapter, though, was behind her. 



With unhurried confidence, Alexia called over a server, ordered a tequila, and began paging through the divorce agreement--unfazed by the attention. 



Marilee recovered her composure first, flashing a sweet smile. ""Alexia, I hope you're alright after yesterday. The reporters caught us all off guard. Someone told me you slipped in the rain. It must have been miserable out there.""





Chapter 5 Watching Her Unravel

Patience faded on Marilee's face as she waited for a reaction, but Alexia wouldn't even meet her eyes. Instead, she directed her attention to Roger. ""Is the Gibson fortune going up in flames? This is all I'm worth?""



A shadow crossed Roger's face. ""That's what the prenup says, so that's all you're entitled to.""



Even before they got married, he'd closed every door to the family's fortune, making sure she'd never find a loophole. 



Realizing Alexia was blatantly ignoring her, Marilee butted in, ""You're getting more than enough, Alexia. Was it love or money you wanted from Roger, anyway?""



Alexia still refused to acknowledge her, not so much as a glance. ""With an amount this pitiful? Hang on to it--you'll need every last cent when the Gibson empire falls apart.""



Those words wiped any patience from Roger's face. ""Don't push it, Alexia.""



Suddenly, Marilee's eyes shimmered with tears and her voice went brittle, as though her heart might break. ""Please, Alexia, don't do this to Roger,"" she whimpered. 



The crowd's attention snapped toward her as sobs and sniffles filled the space. 



Marilee reached for the delicate pink diamond at her throat. ""Maybe you never knew, but Roger and I have loved each other for years. He gave me this necklace on your wedding day--it's a symbol of his devotion. That cherry blossom garden in your backyard? Roger built it just for me, hoping I'd smile. You stole my life. Everything you have should have been mine. Don't you think it's time you let go and left quietly, without asking for more?""



An uncomfortable hush settled over the room. 



It was rare to see a mistress acting so brazenly, demanding the wife walk away with empty hands. 



Finally, Alexia turned to meet Marilee's eyes, her voice colder than ice. ""I stole your life? Was it me who went to the Jenkins family, begging them to accept me? Was I the one who refused a DNA test and strutted around calling myself their true daughter? Did I chase after Roger, desperate for a marriage?""



Every pointed question shattered the silence, each one sharp enough to cut. 



All color drained from Marilee's face, her body rigid beneath Alexia's icy stare. Not missing a beat, Alexia delivered the final blow. ""Go blame your own foolish parents.""



That snapped the last of Marilee's restraint. ""If it weren't for them, you'd still be digging through ga\*\*age. You've been living a luxurious life for twenty years. Without them, you'd be nothing but a pauper.""



A sharp laugh spilled from Alexia. Her gaze drifted to the faded needle marks on her wrist. ""If this is what luxury looks like, I must have missed out. Pain, though? There was always enough of that to go around.""



Disbelief filled Marilee's eyes, her words trembling with contempt. ""Lies. You grew up surrounded by filth--you're nothing but ga\*\*age. If my parents hadn't stepped in, you'd be gone by now. Some gang would have had its way with you and left you in the gutter--""



The rest never left her mouth. A sharp slap rang out, echoing in the room. 



Stunned, Marilee pressed trembling fingers to the swelling red mark, speechless. 



A cold smile curved Alexia's lips. ""There's nothing I despise more than people who never learned basic decency. The Jenkins family or not, I'd still be standing here as myself. But you? Without that divorce agreement, you're nothing more than a shameless mistress.""



Not waiting for a reaction, Alexia hurled the signed divorce agreement straight at Marilee, landing the hit with brutal precision. ""Think of it as my parting gift.""



Marilee flinched as the edges nicked her forehead, letting out a startled cry. The shock left her shaking, the color draining from her lips. 



Alexia watched the panic unraveling Marilee's composure, noticing the nervous twitch on her face. Pretending to care, she cocked her head and offered, ""Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?""



That question broke whatever restraint Marilee had left. ""Why would you ever do that?"" she snapped. 



Alexia gave her a look laced with fake concern. ""It just seems like you're not well at all.""



Marilee's voice cracked as she screamed, ""I am not sick!""



Even Roger turned, uncertain and uneasy as her shrill denial filled the room. 



Unbothered, Alexia let her reply drip with venom, hitting every nerve. ""Funny. People who are actually unwell always insist they're fine. Might be time to book yourself a session with a psychiatrist. And before I forget...cute necklace. But honestly? Junk stones aren't worth much these days.""



Marilee's face turned ashen, her fury and humiliation overwhelming her. Without warning, she collapsed straight into Roger's arms. 



Anger carved hard lines into Roger's face as he pulled Marilee close, glaring at Alexia. ""I never realized you could be so cruel. Just because you wore my ring, you think you can say whatever you want?""



Before Alexia could offer a comeback, a familiar voice cut through the tension, heavy with mockery. ""Really? That's your angle? Just because she wore your ring, you think you could speak to her like that?""



A collective g\*\*p swept through the crowd, all attention snapping to the doorway. There, tall and dangerously handsome, a man entered, charm radiating effortlessly with every step.

Creepy guy following me,"Hi guys, my family has a business in a small turistic area Island and i used to work with my fam every year 3 months till this year. This area is full of restaurants and bars so my neighbour has a restaurant and he has 2 chefs making the dishes… Last 4 years one of his chefs was stalking me on social media, sending me requests etc… I just blocked him everywhere and didn’t really mind till one night i was going to my friends house and i stayed almost 2 hours there and when i was about to go home (walking) at 2;00AM i saw this guy literally waiting for me outside. He approached me and he saw that i got so scared he just gave me some letters and said “read them please” and he left. The next thing i did was i just quickly opened the letter read fast what it was about (out of curiosity) and throw the letter immediately. In the letter he was saying how much he is in love with me and that he wanted to buy me a ring and to marry me and he wrote his number etc. I just ignored all of these and acted like nothing happened.This year i decided to work with my friend in her office for 3 months and didnt want to work with my fam since i wanted to be away from this man a little and also i liked this job more. I dont know how he found out where i was working but he is coming everyday to my office now bothering me and bringing me food to eat + asking me to drink a coffee w him while i’m saying all the time that im engaged and that i will be marrying in 3 months.. + he has a wife and 2 kids too ….

   I think the main thing that makes me unsure is that he still calls me ""bestie"" although this is something I believe I've seen him do with other friends.  


   He's invited me to go to the gym with him after mentioning how he wanted to go, and we've both talked about getting coffee together.   
   I've even invited to take him to a orchard sometime if everything works out and I'm able to drive him, he did have a pause which I felt was noticeable but he said, ""I would love that honestly"", although I might be misremembering and it might have been ""like"" and not ""love"".

   We do have matching profile pictures on the messaging platform we use, although the two characters are 'enemies' the art we are using is more of a ship-art, and I had even said when he mentioned the two characters ""I bet people ship these two"". I was the one who brought up the matching profile pictures in which he agreed so we've been matching for quite a while now.  
   He has also given me his social on another social platform as I mentioned how I had started using it after he suggested it to me. He said I should follow him and now we follow each other. You can repost there and it seems that he may have a friend or two other than me following him, although his account seems personal as there was an artwork he reposted of two people making out and uh- a bit beyond that. Let's say the artwork came from a written piece of work that was very nsfw.

   We are very casual with each other, and have opened up to each other- although I wouldn't say he has really vented to me, but I sort have to him. We have gotten each other small gifts, and he even went out of his way to get a small gift for my sister despite not knowing her well, he seems to want to make the effort to get to know her.

   We're both close and tend to talk daily, usually at a certain time or if something comes up we'll talk sooner.

Any advice or your takes on this would be greatly appreciated, I apologize if I was broad in some areas.  
We do know each other irl however do to convienence we mainly talk online, although we plan to meet asap in a few weeks here.",1,1755299648.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I am weaving a magazine basket that I intend to be the size of a ""lamper"" and also make a lid that fits on top for my Afghans and throw blankets.  Since it'll be the right height for a coffee table I figured I could make a tabletop in it so I can set drinks on.  I want the table top to slightly overhang off the side of the basket so drinks spill away from the basket.  I also intend to make a solid flat base to put on the bottom so nothing can seep in.  I've out a lot of the thought into it.  I'm just really stuck on ideas for the table top.  What can I use for the surface?  I know I'll need an appropriate sealer for the top once done but the base material is not manifesting in my minds eye.  The only thing my brain is stuck on is cardboard with a ton of pc petrifier and a lot of mod podge/paper mache. 

I have access to a wide range of craft materials.  I'm looking at a pretty modest budget because id rather use up unwanted materials for free or cheap.  I'm willing to buy sealers and adhesives and finishes. I don't have access to a saw or any major power equipment but I have drills and bits etc. 

I'm looking for function over longevity, if it breaks in 3 years then it breaks. I have tried to Google diy table tops but the majority of results are upcycling old tables.  I would just upcycle a table but my main priority is storage for the blankets because I need the storage the blankets are in now and I'm making the basket regardless so might as well embrace the functional storage idea.  

Thanks!

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You—""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily’s reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. “What did you say?”  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn’t know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She’d loved him so much she’d given up her future, her dignity—everything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn’t expected her to actually agree this time—to marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, “I’ll do it.”  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. “One month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I’ve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It’s what you owe the Ginger family, and I’m not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...”  
  
“I won’t,” Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
“The Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I’ll take your daughter’s place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.”  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn’t help but reopen the news article she’d just seen.  
  
It was everywhere—videos of John and Elsa Quinn’s wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend—the man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he’d been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She’d heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs…  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they’d been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn’t bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa’s.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands—Elsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her—Elsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa’s neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it… he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn’t call him. Didn’t beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess—just like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
“Why haven’t you gone to bed?”  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, “John, let’s break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents’ keepsake as soon as possible.”  
  
John immediately understood—she must’ve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn’t like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
“Don’t be mad. I didn’t forget your birthday. This is your gift.”  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece—a pink diamond the size of a pigeon’s egg—sparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn’t what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn’t live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
“I don’t want this necklace! I just want my parents’ keepsake!”  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, “That pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!”  
  
*Still throwing a tantrum...*  
  
John’s patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
“Elsa really likes that pendant.”  
  
“She’s so sick—how much longer do you think she’ll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?”        

**Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy**



*Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant…*  
  
But that pendant was hers—left to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
*She wasn’t that pathetic.*  
  
Before she could even say a word, John’s phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. “John, I just threw up blood. I feel awful… Can you come be with me?”  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn’t even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
“Elsa, don’t cry. I’m on my way.”  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn’t bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night—he was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he’d once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she’d marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was—her wedding day would be on John’s birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. *Poetic, really.*  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She’d contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn’t transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she’d ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John’s shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
…  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
“Lily.”  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn’t there.  
  
She wasn’t dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt… emptier.  
  
He couldn’t quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
“Sir, you’re back.”  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. “Did you drink, sir? I’ll make you some ginger tea.”  
  
“No need.”  
  
John wasn’t in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily’s room.  
  
She wasn’t there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy—plush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers…  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, “Where’s Lily?”  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, “Miss Lily said… she broke up with you. And that she’s not coming back.”  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
*So she was still throwing a tantrum?*  
  
*Running away from home?*  
  
*She really thought she had guts now, huh?*  
  
“Mandy, leave.”  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn’t possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger—she could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn’t take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
“Lily, how long are you going to keep this up?”  
  
John typed the message into the chat app—but then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she’d just walk out for good.  
  
He didn’t need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She’d had no home since then.  
  
If she didn’t come back to him—where else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they’d argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
*This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.*  
  
…  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn’t had a good night’s sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching—she really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she’d built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream—to become a great voice actress.  
  
“Lily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can’t hold it anymore!”  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. “Mr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO’s office for me?”  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn’t want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn’t want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO’s office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock—then froze.  
  
She heard Elsa’s coy, flirty voice.  
  
“John, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!”  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa’s body suddenly go limp—and fall into John’s lap.  
  
“Elsa…”  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she’d get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn’t move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
“John, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?”  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his—  
  
And John didn’t move away.       

**Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake**



""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John’s relationship.  
  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her—only to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I’m sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily’s dull gaze dropped to Elsa’s shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn’t say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn’t help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, *“*Lily, meeting you is the happiest thing that’s ever happened to me. I’ll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.”  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend’s shoelace. She’d snuggled into John’s arms and teased, “Would you tie mine if it came undone?”  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that—too childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn’t.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense—it wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his “can’ts,” were never about principle.  
  
*He just didn’t love her.*  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa’s laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John’s arms again, Lily didn’t linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn’t know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. “Don’t… don’t read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He—”  
  
“Wayne, I’ve already broken up with John.”  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn’t let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, “He loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he’s tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love—I don’t want it. Wayne, I’ve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.”  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn’t need John’s signature to quit—but she did need his.  
  
“You’re really sure about this? Does the boss know?”  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn’t want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn’t fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood—leaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn’t just called her name. He’d insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he’d fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
“Ms. Lily, you’re giving this directly to the boss? I’ll bring it to him. I’ll talk to him first. If he agrees, I’ll sign it.”  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn’t want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn’t approve it, she wouldn’t be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
…  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John’s office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John’s face was thunderous.  
  
“Boss…”  
  
“Who made this coffee?”  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn’t signed Lily’s resignation yet—but she’d already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before—so good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else’s brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, “Boss, it wasn’t Ms. Lily. She just… she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?”  
  
*Resign?*  
  
John’s expression darkened even further.          



**Chapter 4 They All Forced Lily to Apologize to Elsa**



As if realizing something, John let out a cold laugh.  
  
So that’s what this was—Lily was throwing a tantrum and threatening him with a resignation. Playing hard to get, was she?  
  
He knew better than anyone how much she wanted to be his personal assistant.  
  
She’d buttered him up for days just to land that role.  
  
If he really approved her resignation, she’d be the first to panic.  
  
She needed a lesson—to understand she had gone too far this time.  
  
“Sign it.”  
  
After letting out that icy aura, John added coldly, “And when you do, tell her—if she resigns, she better never come back.”  
  
Wayne shrank his neck.  
  
He wanted to say Lily seemed completely determined this time, like she never intended to come back at all.  
  
But the killing intent radiating from John was too terrifying, so he kept quiet.  
  
He just nodded and respectfully went to sign off on her resignation.  
  
…  
  
Once Wayne signed, Lily quickly completed all her paperwork and left the company.  
  
Almost the moment she got back to the hotel, a message came in from John.  
  
“Come to Flora Club.”  
  
Flora Club—the place John always took his friends for drinks and parties.  
  
Lily had broken up with him. She had no intention of going.  
  
She was about to refuse when another message followed:  
  
“If you still want your parents’ keepsake, be in front of me in half an hour.”  
  
Lily desperately wanted to get that pendant back. She didn’t dare delay and rushed to Flora Club.  
  
Inside the private room, Elsa and several of John’s close friends were already there.  
  
When Lily pushed open the door, she immediately saw John seated in the center of a deep red leather couch, Elsa curled up beside him.  
  
Elsa lifted her chin proudly, striking and radiant as ever.  
  
John sat protectively at her side, every movement full of tenderness and care.  
  
Lily felt a sharp sting behind her eyes.  
  
But she had come for a reason. She swallowed the bitterness and stepped inside.  
  
“Apologize to Elsa!”  
  
The moment John saw her, he slammed his glass down at her feet.  
  
“How dare you send thugs after Elsa to steal the pendant? If Simon hadn’t happened to pass by and save her, she would've been assaulted by those animals!”  
  
His friends all jumped in, shouting their indignation.  
  
“Hey, you, that was too much!”  
  
“We get that you’re jealous of Elsa, but this? You can’t just send people to attack her!”  
  
“Apologize to Elsa now. Maybe if she lets it go, John will still forgive you!”  
  
*Elsa…*  
  
Lily stood frozen, face pale.  
  
She’d loved John so much. She had gone out of her way to be nice to his friends, always trying to fit in.  
  
But in all the years she was with John, not one of them ever called her by name. Their attitude had never even been respectful.  
  
She used to think they were just arrogant and blunt by nature.  
  
But hearing the way they now fawned over Elsa, she finally understood—they had never lacked manners. They simply knew John didn’t truly care about her. She wasn’t worth respecting.  
  
But Elsa—despite having betrayed John four years ago—was cradled in the palm of his hand. So now, they all worshiped her too.  
  
“Lily, apologize to Elsa!”  
  
John’s cold voice snapped in her ear. Lily snapped out of her daze.  
  
She hadn’t done anything. Of course she wouldn’t admit to something she didn’t do.  
  
“I didn’t send anyone to hurt Elsa. I—”  
  
“Those thugs said you were behind it. Elsa wouldn’t lie!”  
  
John cut her off without letting her finish. “I’ll say it one more time. Apologize.”  
  
*Elsa wouldn’t lie…*  
  
Lily almost laughed out loud.  
  
*So if Elsa said something, it was the truth? But when I spoke, it was all lies?*  
  
Even if he loved Elsa more, after four years together, shouldn’t he know what kind of person I was?  
  
Shouldn’t he trust me, just a little?  
  
Was it really that easy for him to condemn her?  
  
“I didn’t do anything wrong. I won’t apologize to Elsa.”  
  
Lily hated being falsely accused. Even as the cold in her chest turned to ice, she still stood up for herself.  
  
“If someone’s word is all it takes to convict a person, then what if I say Elsa’s a murderer? Should we send her to jail? I didn’t do this. I’m not admitting to it. Call the police if you want. If they find me guilty, fine—but they’ll need evidence. Elsa’s lies don’t count.”  
  
“John… I didn’t lie…”  
  
Elsa’s voice trembled, her eyes red.  
  
A proud, dazzling rose now looked soft and wounded. It only made her more lovable.  
  
John’s patience with Lily had completely run out.  
  
He pulled out the pendant and held it up like a weapon.  
  
“Apologize to Elsa, or you’ll never see this again.”  
  
Lily’s gaze dropped to the pendant.  
  
It had been handmade by her parents, after studying with a master craftsman.  
  
Delicate gold filigree, encircling a fine piece of Hetian jade—one of a kind.  
  
Just seeing it brought back memories.  
  
Four years ago, when John was cast out by the Jones family after the accident, his father’s illegitimate son had tried to kill him.  
  
That snowy night, Lily had shielded him with her own body, taking two stab wounds before the police arrived.  
  
That night, her pendant had been stolen by those hired thugs.  
  
She’d lost it while saving his life.  
  
Even if he didn’t love her.  
  
Even if his heart belonged to Elsa.  
  
Once he recovered it, he should’ve returned it to her.  
  
Not used it as leverage to hurt her.  
  
“John, don’t be so hard on Lily.”  
  
Elsa cast Lily a smug glance, then pretended to smooth things over. “I don’t care about the past.”  
  
“Why not have Lily drink a glass of wine? Let’s just call it even and move on.”  
  
Hearing this, John frowned slightly.  
  
But unable to say no to the sickly Elsa, he gave a cold nod.  
  
Lily kept telling herself—this man wasn’t worth her tears.  
  
But when she saw him nod, her eyes still turned red.  
  
*He knew she couldn’t drink.*  
  
Her stomach's not great; she once had bleeding from drinking too much. The doctor had warned her never to drink again.  
  
John had held her, eyes full of guilt, promising to get stronger, to protect her, to never let her suffer again.  
  
But now, for Elsa, he made her suffer over and over.  
  
“I’ll drink.”  
  
She didn’t explain.  
  
Explaining to someone who didn’t believe her was pointless.  
  
All she wanted was to get the pendant back and leave.  
  
She looked at the rows of hard liquor on the table and gave a bitter smile.  
  
“If I drink all of these, will you give it back?”  
  
John’s eyes darkened like a gathering storm.  
  
For some reason, Lily’s smile stabbed at him.  
  
She seemed so far away now.  
  
But he still believed—Lily could never truly leave him.  
  
Elsa was dying. Even if Lily had just sent thugs to get the pendant and not to hurt Elsa, the scare alone was enough. He wouldn’t let Elsa suffer in her final days.  
  
His voice turned cold. “Drink.”  
  
Lily exhaled slowly.  
  
So he meant it. Drink it all, and he’d return the pendant.  
  
They were all hard liquors.  
  
Her eyelids twitched.  
  
But she didn’t back down.  
  
She grabbed a bottle and began to chug.  
  
It burned all the way down.  
  
Like fire searing her mouth, her throat, her heart.  
  
So this was what it felt like—to love the wrong person.  
  
Like being skinned alive, crushed to ash.  
  
*So she had to stop loving John. She had to move on.*  
  
“Enough!”  
  
Seeing her flushed face, her swaying body, the way she reached for another bottle, John couldn’t bear it anymore.  
  
He snatched the bottle from her and smashed it on the floor.  
  
“Take your pendant and get out!”  
  
“John…”  
  
Elsa hated anyone taking what she wanted.  
  
Lily had taken John while she was abroad—she wouldn’t let her get away with it again.  
  
She knew that pendant was too important to Lily. She couldn’t let her have it.  
  
As John reached to hand it over, Elsa grabbed it first and threw herself into his arms.  
  
“My stomach… it hurts so much… John, am I dying? It hurts…”  
  
As she sobbed, she even spat out a bit of blood.  
  
“Elsa!”  
  
Panicked, John scooped her into his arms and rushed out of the room.  
  
“Hold on, Elsa. I won’t let anything happen to you!”  
  
“John—!”  
  
Lily staggered forward, desperate to get the pendant.  
  
But just as she reached him, Elsa lifted her leg—and her foot slammed right into Lily’s face.  
  
Lily was already unsteady. The kick sent her crashing to the ground.  
  
As luck would have it, she struck her temple against the sharp edge of the table.  
  
Blood immediately gushed down her face, blurring her vision.  
  
“Lily!”  
  
Hearing the thud, John turned in panic.  
  
When he saw her bleeding, her pale face stained with red, his dark eyes filled with alarm.  
  
“It hurts…**”**  
  
Elsa’s pained whimper brought him back to reality.  
  
Without another glance at Lily, he turned and ran.  
  
Lily was injured.  
  
But it was just a cut. She was strong. She could take care of herself.  
  
Elsa, on the other hand, was dying. She needed him.  
  
He couldn’t let her down.           



**Chapter 5 His Heart Raced—for Lily**



After John carried Elsa out, his friends all rushed to the hospital after them, eager to show concern and help.  
  
Soon, the luxurious private room was left with only Lily and Simon.  
  
Simon was the only heir to the Bale family, one of Capital City’s top elite lineages.  
  
He and John had grown up like brothers, thick as thieves.  
  
He’d spent the past few years abroad. When John was cast out of the Jones family, they lost touch. It wasn’t until Simon returned six months ago that he found out what had happened.  
  
Unlike John’s other friends, who dismissed Lily because they sensed John didn’t care much for her, Simon disliked Lily for a different reason: he doted on Elsa, truly saw her as a little sister.  
  
When he was ten, he went with his father on a charity trip to the countryside and got caught in a terrible earthquake. He and Elsa were trapped in the rubble together.  
  
He had been gravely injured, unable even to speak. If not for Elsa comforting him and encouraging him the whole time, he wouldn’t have survived until rescue.  
  
Elsa was smart, radiant, noble—Capital City’s proud and untouchable red rose. Lily, aside from a prettier face, had nothing to compare.  
  
""Lily, you dared to send thugs to attack Lizzy? You deserve to die.""  
  
Lily, still staring blankly in the direction John had gone, was stunned by Simon’s voice.  
  
Lizzy?  
  
Clearly, Simon meant Elsa.  
  
Funny… her childhood nickname had also been Lizzy.  
  
Only her now-deceased loved ones and the friend trapped with her in the rubble sixteen years ago had ever called her that.  
  
But that friend had never spoken. She never even knew his name.  
  
The pocket watch he gave her had been stolen years ago. There was no chance they’d ever meet again.  
  
Simon looked at her bloodied face and felt even more disgusted. To him, John being with her was rock bottom.  
  
His anger flared. Without thinking, he picked up a glass of liquor and threw it in her face.  
  
""Touch Lizzy again, and I’ll make your life worse than death.""  
  
""I didn’t hurt Elsa!""  
  
The wound on her forehead flared with pain.  
  
The alcohol stung like acid, and her body trembled like a dead leaf in the wind.  
  
But her defiance refused to break. She pulled herself to her feet and, with every bit of strength she had left, slapped Simon across the face.  
  
""I’ll say it again—Elsa’s word alone doesn’t convict me!""  
  
""Call the police if you want. Without real evidence, they can’t arrest me either.""  
  
""And you? You have no right to throw anything at me.""  
  
""Lily!""  
  
Simon stood frozen for half a minute before his voice returned.  
  
He was the Bale family’s heir, the golden boy of Capital City. People flattered and fawned over him. He couldn’t believe someone had just slapped him.  
  
Especially a woman he despised.  
  
If he weren’t the type to avoid hitting women, he would’ve snapped her neck on the spot.  
  
Lily caught the murderous gleam in his eyes. Her eyelid twitched.

Hi everyone – trying to remember the name of a live-action action film. Everyone I’ve asked has no idea what I’m talking about but I’m certain this was an actual movie that I’ve watched! 
It features a female main character whose name is a number (like Two, Three, Seven, etc.).

I can only vividly remember one scene in which, she’s walking down a street with a man, and he asks her why her name is a number.
She explains that her parents changed her name every year based on her age (so when she turned 2 they called her Two, when she turned 3 they called her Three, and so on).
She says this continued until her parents passed away.
After she explains this, they walk through a door together into either an office or a coffee shop.

1mrddyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingToLosAngeles/comments/1mrddyd/help_figuring_out_where_to_live/,Help figuring out where to live,"Hi,

I'm considering moving to LA for a job. The office is located on Olympic boulevard, relatively close to the Expo/Bundy station.

I am a fairly high-earner, and would be looking for a 1br that is under 3k.
The biggest caveat for me is that I don't drive (I know, I know), and have a very strong preference for walkable areas with a grocery store/shops/coffee shops nearby. I know these two requests are pretty insane in LA but I am hoping that its possible. I would also like a scommute that is on the shorter side (sub-30-mins would be amazing)

I have been considering locations along the metro E line, since it makes getting to work easier. I've been eyeing downtown Santa Monica, but I've seen people mentioning it not being safe. I am a woman so it's a bit of a concern, but as long as I can walk through areas that are lit I don't mind it too much. I have also seen people recommend Culver city, but it looks a bit out of the way as a person with no car. I am also happy to bike/combine biking with other methods of transportation if it's not too much of a hassle and if I don't need to ride on busy highways.

How is the Metro as a method of transportation between these stations? I have been to different cities with different levels of safety/usage of the metro system (between empty, graffitied carts with one slightly-menacing person in the corner and full, clean and well lit ones), and Id like to know if I should utilize it or try to avoid it.",0,1755298929.0,MovingToLosAngeles,7,0.5,False

1mrddmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mrddmq/aita_for_forcing_my_friend_to_dump_her_bf_part_2/,AITA for forcing my friend to dump her bf (part 2),"After I shouted at my best friend's boyfriend and blocked his number, I decided to take my friend out for coffee to help her cheer up after the fight.

We were sitting there, sipping our drinks, when she casually dropped a bomb: he has severe anger issues. He breaks things when he’s mad. Then she told me something that made me almost choke on my latte—one time, he got into a fight with a friend and beat him so badly that the friend ended up in the ICU.

I stared at her in shock and asked if she thought that was concerning. She shrugged and said, “He would never hit me. He loves me.”
That’s when it hit me—this guy wasn’t just a jealous boyfriend. He was dangerous.

But there was nothing I could do. She was blinded by love, and my opinions didn’t matter to her because, according to her, I’d never been in love and didn’t understand. She had her entire life planned with him, and all I could do was watch my beautiful, smart, caring friend lose herself to an abusive man.

Two weeks later, we went to the mall with my sister and another friend of ours—let’s call her Marie. My sister and my best friend got caught up taking pictures, while Marie and I were starving. So we ditched them for a bit to grab some food.

I sent my best friend a snap of me with my food, and she replied: “Where’s my girl?”

I didn’t know what she meant. I assumed she was asking about Marie, or maybe she’d lost my sister in the crowd. So I texted back: “Which one?”—meaning, was she talking about Marie or my sister.

Her reply came fast: “I only have one girl. What are you talking about?”

Still confused, I asked: “Are you sure?”

Then came the twist: “It’s me (her boyfriend), and why are you accusing me of cheating?”

Right then, my best friend and my sister showed up at my table, telling me their phones had died. I showed my friend the texts from her boyfriend, and she jokingly told me to grill him and see if he’d confess to anything.

So I sent him: “Are you sure there’s no one else?”

That’s when he completely lost it—accusing me of being shady from the start, calling me a snake trying to sabotage their relationship, and saying I was falsely accusing him of cheating so they’d break up.

Seeing the argument spiraling, I told him the truth—that I was only pressing him because my best friend told me to—and I left it at that. I didn’t even bother reading the rest of his messages.

When I got home, I saw he’d texted me from a different number, apologizing. I didn’t like him and only tolerated him because of my friend, so I left him on read. Three days later, my friend asked me to reply, so I just gave his apology a thumbs-up and moved on. After that, I stayed out of their drama.


A few weeks later, I walked in on my friend crying in the bathroom. I asked what happened, and she said her boyfriend was driving her insane.

I asked what he’d done this time. She told me that the day before, she was walking to college while on call with him. One of our guy friends was ahead of her, crossing the road with headphones in, completely unaware of a speeding car coming straight at him.

She said she grabbed his backpack and yanked him out of harm’s way. Afterward, she jokingly asked him if he had a death wish. Her boyfriend heard all of this through the phone—and went ballistic. He told her she should have let the guy get run over instead of touching his backpack, and then called her a cheater and a hoe.

That’s when she broke down and told me she’d been feeling suffocated for months. She confessed she’d been having thoughts of ending her life and hurting herself, and then she showed me the scars on her arms.

My heart shattered. I told her she had my full support and that I’d do anything to help her. She said she wanted to end things but feared he wouldn’t take it well. (Pt 3 coming soon)",0,1755298907.0,AITAH,0,0.4,False

1mrdcnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/1mrdcnq/restored_some_waffle_irons/,Restored some waffle irons,"# Backstory

Hello there,

A few months ago I restored multiple waffle irons. They are all the property of my grandmother, the youngest of her household so sadly many of her brothers and sisters are no longer with us. And for some reason she just accumulated multiple of their waffle irons over the years.

She wanted to host a ""wafelenbak"" (basically afternoon coffee and cake but waffles instead of cake) as we call it, using those old waffle irons. I was more interested in saving my grandmother the hours of labour getting those irons somewhat clean with a wire brush and with my love for chemistry I thought it would be a good excuse to give electrolysis a shot. She let me keep one and I have been making loads of waffles since!

This subreddit has simultaneously been very helpful and extremely unhelpful somehow... It is a good starting point to get familiar with the terminologies, options and some creative solutions and examples. So in an attempt to steer a little more towards the side of helpful I want to leave my experience and thoughts here to hopefully spark some conversation or assist someone in the future.

Since this subreddit is extremely USA-centric I'll take this opportunity to also give some insight from a Belgian perspective on waffles and some info about the waffle irons for the enthusiasts.

# What, how and why

* I used a metal trash can from Ikea with a trash bag inside filling it with water and soda crystals (Na2CO3, also called washing soda). I dumped a bunch in there, much more than most people recommend on here. My reasoning being that more electrolyte won't hurt and adding more of it makes the water more basic (increase the pH) as I hoped this would saponify the residual oils somewhat. Using Na2CO3 at room temperature should get to a pH around 12, which is high but not as high as you can get with straight NaOH (lye). I did not have any NaOH on hand at the time so I can't really compare. Takeaway: adding more electrolyte is seemingly not detrimental or beneficial
* As a power supply I used an old PC-power supply. It must have been around 20 years old, from when they still had physical on/off switches on them. This worked fine, but it meant I had to turn it on first and either wait for a bit and lower the waffle iron in slowly as otherwise the power supply would go into safety and stop delivering power. (It also goes into safety when the anode and cathode touch). Takeaway: (old) pc power supply works but a bit of a hassle
* I did this inside the garage. Doing it in the garage meant I could use some overhead beams to hang the waffle irons and sacrificial anode from while also being able to reposition them as close together as possible while the process was ongoing. I used a steel plate that was due to be recycled anyway. Using only one anode meant I did have to turn around the waffle iron so both sides got a good cleaning. I did calculate the H2 and O2 production using the amps reported on the power supply and what I measured using a multi meter and estimated that it would take a week to a month of continuous operation to fill my garage with a dangerous H2/O2 mix depending on my assumptions. I never took diffusion/ventilation into account so in reality it would take longer. This is a large 2 car garage. Takeaway: It is possible to do electrolysis inside, safely if you know what you are doing
* I tried to look into how the seasoning works but I'm still somewhat dissatisfied with the number of academic papers on this topic. My current conclusion is that there are multiple mechanisms, including radical mechanisms (in situ created radicals attacking double bonds as well as oxygen diracals creating crosslinks) and reactions involving the ester/acid side as attacking reagent. It is difficult to estimate the relative importance of these mechanisms but keeping this in mind I prefer to do the seasoning in the oven for the following reasons:
   * The temperature is easier to regulate and prevent overheating/burning
   * more even heating => more even coating
   * a constant supply of air (I hope this promotes the oxygen mechanism)
   * electric (better for environment, free as my solar panels were overproducing at the time anyway)
* On the topic of seasoning oil... I'm similarly dissatisfied with the information I could find. From a chemical point of view, just about any oil or fat should work (waxes as well). All I'm currently convinced of is that a liquid oil is much easier to apply as you can apply it cold. I used refined peanut oil (it should not contain many protein and any left in there would be denatured by the high temperatures. Neither I or anyone I know are allergic so even if any protein survived the seasoning and somehow got into the waffles it won't be an issue). Peanut oil was just a cheap liquid oil I had on hand. The results are great! I applied it cold and put it in a preheated oven (250°C) for about an hour. Let it cool down and repeated it. I took it out after 20 minutes once and the coating was softer. My end result is almost glass-like. Takeaway: use whatever oil you want, liquid oils might be easier to use

 

# Some history on old Belgian cast iron waffle irons

There are multiple different styles of waffle and as such also different styles of waffle irons. Pretty much every household in the past century seemingly had at least one waffle iron to make [Brussels](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkoken.vtm.be%2Fsites%2Fkoken.vtm.be%2Ffiles%2Frecipe%2Fimage%2F2015%2F02%2Fbrusselse-wafels.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=5ca66a98719f5f0e4c5624212f4e6a3d113d93a82c1f0f40d66e27edf9c9d136) and [Liège](https://cdn.getyourguide.com/image/format=auto,fit=crop,gravity=auto,quality=60,width=450,height=450,dpr=2/tour_img/cb63a539eee6ae60.jpeg) style waffles. And in western Belgium waffles called ""[lukken](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/tmRw7grtANNQplNhsy0QGB6GXG32wueKAAPRD7YZYeUUduA5KMWKw2SrQ44SknAOed5Vr6MTC1n4ARArAEF4V-ZBbHT1wQ)"" are pretty popular around new years baked in [special irons](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4XodeBYtXdXPIiGH5OVJlRA-0O0tMRi9OObf0J6pcLw-nRm7a7sywORSw1Fw8pyV-rZbTA0CnovoRyNLcFH4IrviS9uowtfs9jlcP0-rHhddQxssU_l3G0XNUGh6rydjZO-gVNAbV1ZU/s2048/20200206_110003.jpg). As such, many of these irons are still around but are mostly collecting dust or used as decoration.

Being as common as they were, there were many variations but very few established brand names. Most waffle irons are unmarked so determining age or maker is difficult, mine is probably around 50 years old.

Additionally most of these irons would have been sold with a support ring to be used on a type of stove that was popular in Belgium in the 20th century ([Leuvense stoof](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Flive.staticflickr.com%2F2105%2F2255342048_a4d8ddfd3d_b.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=bf09da8d59e1e026d685ba909ed84b19007a093028a92d75a62310b6822946ff)). Most people have induction stovetops now making these irons limited to outside use on the barbeque or over a firepit.

I have never seen an iron that opens vertically or is round in shape like the American ones posted here regularly. Even the ones you seem to call a ""Belgian waffle maker"" are far from the design of these old cast iron ones.

 

# About the waffles themselves

Brussels style waffles are supposed to be crispy and lightweight and more like a way to deliver a topping, almost like a piece of toast (but better). There is no or very little sugar in the batter. Traditionally is just to put some sugar on top, either a lot of (light) brown sugar or a little amount of powdered sugar.

Liège style waffles are much denser and filled with large chunks of sugar. What is traditional is somewhat disputed, some claim there should be no sugar in the dough itself (only the pearl sugar), others claim there needs to be cinnamon in there. These should be enjoyed hot without any toppings. All those stacked Liège waffles with loads of toppings are nothing more than a tourist trap, although I would forgive a bit of chocolate on there.

Both styles are made with yeast, preferably fresh yeast as this gives a better taste compared to dry yeast (instant yeast). Long ago, Brussels style waffles were made using beer yeast and they still are sometimes, but the taste is different and beer yeast is harder to come by.

I'll update this post with my recipes if there is enough interest tomorrow as it is already past midnight here.

# TLDR:

Restored some old Belgian waffle irons for my grandmother and provided some info about what, how and why I did it the way I did. I aslo provided some information about the history of Belgian waffles and Belgian cast iron waffle irons
