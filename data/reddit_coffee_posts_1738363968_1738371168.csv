I’m having a hard time connecting with and meeting new ppl around here and I’m sure I’m not alone in that experience. especially in the midst of some unfortunate times, I was curious if there’s any ppl who’d like to crochet together?? 

Could be a good opportunity to just come together and chat, do something that we love in peace, share knowledge and inspiration for projects, have some snacks and tea together, or whatever the vibe is! For such a small town I’ve been surprised with the lack of clubs/meetups in the community. If something like this already exists plz point me in the right direction! 

Anyone interested please reach out and maybe we can get a coffee meet together or something!",1,1738371120.0,lafayette,0,1.0,False
1ieuccr,https://www.reddit.com/r/isc2/comments/1ieuccr/my_milestone_before_taking_real_cissp_exam/,My milestone before taking real CISSP exam,"
Note: I officially become CISSP in January 2025

—-

Because I have passed ISC2 CC and SSCP, my learning method will prioritize doing a lot of practice tests instead of reading the entire CISSP Official Study Guide (OSG).

The main course I use is ThorTeaches, I bought the Bundle package including the course videos, Easy/Mid test, Hard test and Boson.

I use Luke's course to do practice tests.

On average, it takes me about 2-3 hours/day to review and it takes me more than 10 months to complete all the milestones before I can confidently schedule the exam.

First, I watch Thor's lecture slides, watch the videos and complete the questions in the lecture. For this part, those who already have basic knowledge can go quickly, and you can rest assured that the gaps in your knowledge will be revealed in the tests. Therefore, don't spend too much time the first time having to understand 100% of all the topics in the lecture.

Next, I started doing the practice test, this is the most important part. 
- First, I did the practice test for each domain. 
- A set of Thor questions has 125 questions, after completing a set of questions, the answers will be sent to you via email. 
- Read the answers, check and understand why the answers are wrong and why they are right, understanding right and wrong is the most important thing to understand the CISSP Mindset. 
After completing all the test sets for each domain, I continued to do the Thor test in the Exam Emulation section. The part has a common question bank with the test for each domain. However, the questions of the 8 domains are mixed in the correct ratio according to the ratio of each domain in the real exam. 
I continued the above loop: doing the test, recording the results, understanding the answers. During the test, if I am not confident in explaining any topic, I will use OSG to refer to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. 
Next, I finished reading the CISSP Concise Guide (DestCert) and re-did the Thor Test Easy/Mid. To continue the journey and confidently take the exam, Thor requires you to achieve 80%-85% for Easy/Mid, which is an extremely precise requirement, in my opinion, it is a gold standard to pass the exam. I completed all the Easy/Mid test sets above 85% (each domain must not be below 70%). After completing this milestone, I continued to move on. 

I use LearnZApp to update and supplement the latest concepts of CISSP version 2024. I achieved an average score of over 90% in LearnZApp. When doing the exercises in LearnZApp, I still have to follow the principle: explain the concepts why they are wrong, why they are right, and for places that I am not confident in explaining, use OSG for reference, use ThorTeaches and Concise to see the explanation. 

After completing the above milestones, I can also schedule the exam. However, because I want to pass the first time, I continue to do the practice test with Luke, Thor Hard Test. 

And finally, to be confident that I can pass the exam, the Boson simulation test is something that needs to be conquered. The Boson simulation test above 70% is a milestone that needs to be achieved before entering the exam room. 

Regarding test-taking strategies, I have consulted many sources and there are also quite a few instructional videos on YouTube. However, during the test, you should adjust the time appropriately, do not be like me: completing 136/150 questions and then running out of time. 

I wish everyone who takes the CISSP exam will pass the exam.

The recent actions from the U.S. government are bullying our great nation. While all levels of government will undoubtedly be working hard to mitigate the impacts, this is a crucial moment that calls for a full grassroots response to the tariffs—perhaps a once-in-a-generation opportunity.

We need grassroots action across Canada, and it’s essential for Ottawa's citizens—not just the government—the Nation’s Capital to take the lead. I have drawn So so much inspiration from the local warriors in the “**Battle of Billings Bridge**” (reference link needed), and I think it’s time to unite.

While we should all commit to “buy Canadian,” we need to consider more public and media-friendly initiatives. Symbolic actions can be incredibly empowering, especially when we feel pushed around by external a$$holes.

I’d love to hear everyone’s ideas on what actions we could take. One thought is to promote the local coffee company, **Second Cup**, over Starbucks. Imagine a day where we gather a few dozen people to “picket” or redirect Starbucks customers at the Rideau Centre to Second Cup. It could send a powerful message and be both wildly satisfying and empowering. If successful, we could replicate this in other cities!

Just a thought! It’s everyone’s responsibility to do something, no matter how small. Post your ideas and lets get the ball rolling! ",3,1738370954.0,ottawa,0,1.0,False

1ieubfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ieubfh/i_m33_cheated_and_fucked_around_and_found_out_w/,I (m33) cheated and fucked around and found out w (f28),"I miss her. She is never going to come back. We have had a tumultuous relationship full of trauma. Cheating on both parts. Seemingly always end up getting back together. A year ago everything came to a crashing halt. She found out I cheated again. I stopped. 


She never believed me. I spent that year chasing her making things right. Doing everythjng possibly to show her how much I cared for her. It was too late damage done. She spent that year with me, just biding her time until she felt like she was ready to move on. Birthday in October. We go on a road trip. First vacation for me in a year. Semi wonderful trip. I still have no idea she is planning on breaking up with me. December it’s all over. She wants nothing to do with me. 

We spend 50 days apart. The only thing I feel is guilt. I wake up in cold sweats. I sleep very little as every dream is a nightmare of her not being there for me. I’ve been in previous relationships, never one like this. Never has a break up impacted me physically before. The entire time I pray that we can make things work. 



I got into the habit of circling the drain and looking at places online she might be. She had since long blocked me on instagram and socials. I have no way to communicate with her. See her on a fetish website. Message her asking what the fuck is this. She replies. We chat on the phone and despite her being somewhat aggressive and me being overly passive, we agree to get drinks. 


We meet up and i scoop her up swing her around kissing her neck. It’s like I saw an angel. I’ll never forget how at peace I felt. I wanted nothing more for the past couple of months. Obviously it was short lived. The next couple of nights we talk through all the extra curriculars of the relationship gaining further perspective. I apologize profusely. She does the same. Marriage is spoken about. Say we will, that we couldn’t see one another with any one else. The thought of her being with anyone else repulses me, causes nausea. 


After a couple of days of spending the night together, we get coffee and she drops the bombshell that she will be moving to California. My heart sink. Immediately start heaving and shit. It’s too much to bear. I worked through her cheating and me seeing the products of that. I know it’s possible even with the lack of initial trust to rebuild. Not with distance. Fuck. I’m alone. I’m scared. All these thoughts go through my mind. 


I spend the next 5 days curled up in bed. Unable to move or sleep or eat. Going through the paces. Calling out of work. It made me sick. We are no longer in contact. I have obviously reached out to deaf ears. I think sometimes distance does the heart good, but this distance is insidious. Point is to kill any remaining love. 


Now I feel empty. My mom just spoke to me and told me it’s been two months of my suffering that I need to get over it. I cannot help but feel a pit in my stomach. She was everything for me. I am very much independent as a person but I find myself lost at the thought of actually being alone. She’s probably smiling right now. I am alone in the dark. I’m not much of a drinker. I’m going out again tonight with a friend. We are going to get beers. I’ll go through the motion and pretend everything is alright. 


I cannot stand to think of life without her. I didn’t value her, I didn’t appreciate what I had. She’s no angel. She’s vindictive and angry and manipulative but she was so amazingly beautiful. She really loved me. It’s not all my fault. Maybe 70% is. Dark thoughts creeping in every night. No sleep continues. I force myself to hit the gym. I force myself to eat. I force myself to take care of my responsibilities. I have lucid moments where I’m focused on the present. I get alone and it’s back to spiraling. 


Not really much for me to say other than I’ll miss her forever. There’s a lot for me to unpack and a lot of room for self improvement. At times I wish I never met her and she never met me. I never considered the 6 year relationship a waste of time. So many lessons learned. I vowed to never cheat again. I meant it. I’ve kept my promise. 

I don’t think I will ever love again. I just want to disappear. I hope she is happy where ever she is right now. 


TLDR: Shes going to move to California and live with her best friend. She will date again. She will look someone in the eyes and want to hold them. She will want to be vulnerable with someone else. I fucked around and let my ego get the best of me. I played a massive part in this relationship failing. I take responsibility. I miss her ",1,1738370941.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I’m honestly questioning everything now, and I don’t know if I’m overreacting.

Yesterday, my stepdad had a huge fight with my mom, and in the middle of it, he decided to kick both of us out. My mom packed her things and left without me, telling me to stay home. So for hours, I was stuck in the house alone with my stepdad, who was still angry and kept knocking on my door, asking when I was going to leave. I had nowhere to go, no car, and no way to get out of the situation.

I was panicking, shaking, and had no idea what to do, so I texted my boyfriend. He was clearly worried and kept saying how bad he felt for me, but what really shocked me was his complete lack of action. He never offered to call me, let alone come pick me up or help me figure out a way to get out of there. He just kept saying he hoped I could work it out and suggested I try calling my brother. That was it.

For context, this was his day off. He wasn’t working, wasn’t busy—just sitting at home. He had a car and was fully capable of helping me in some way. But he didn’t.

At one point, I directly asked him how he could just sit there and not offer to help me in any way. His response? He was “scared to death” to get involved because what if my parents called the cops on him for taking me to his place? Like… what? I’ve been over to his house countless times, sometimes for 10+ hours, and my parents have never had an issue with it. I had never even asked to stay over—I just needed to get out for a few hours to calm down and feel safe.

I explained this to him, telling him I wasn’t asking him to interfere in my family’s drama—I just needed help getting out of an unsafe environment. But he doubled down, saying he didn’t want to “put himself or his family in trouble by interfering.”

That’s when it hit me: he was more worried about some hypothetical inconvenience than the fact that I was literally panicking, unsafe, and had nowhere to go. He could’ve easily just picked me up and taken me somewhere neutral—a coffee shop, a park, anywhere—but he didn’t.

His final response was, “I don’t even know what to say… I’m just sorry and I wish there was something I could do to help.” And that pissed me off, because there was something he could do. He just chose not to.

I told him, “I’m sorry for myself too, for thinking I could actually depend on you.” Then I said I didn’t want to talk to him right now. He left me on read and hasn’t responded in over a day.

And now, I can’t stop thinking about how this changes everything. We’ve been together for almost a year, and I really thought he’d have my back if something ever happened to me. This was the first real test of that, and he completely failed. I feel like I can’t trust him now. What happens in the future if I ever need him again? Will he just sit there and do nothing like this time?

I genuinely feel like I want to break up. I always assumed if I married him, I’d be with someone who would support me and protect me when things got hard. But now, I feel like I’m just alone. Am I overreacting? AITA for being this upset?",3,1738370767.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,3,1.0,False

### 1. For anyone who has never obtained an ISC2 certification, ISC2 CC (Certified in Cybersecurity Certification) is the best place to start.

- 1.1 Register an ISC2 account to become an ISC2 Candidate. You should only use 1 email (your name) to work long-term with ISC2.

- 1.2 ISC2 CC is offering free study and free exams at the link https://www.isc2.org/training/online-self-paced/cc-online-self-paced. The link to get CODE is free of CC exam fees - https://my.isc2.org/s/Candidate-Benefits/1MCC-exam-instructions (you need to complete the ISC2 account registration to be able to access).

- 1.3 It may take you 2 - 4 months to complete the course. However, after finishing the course, you should not register for the exam. I will explain why you should not take the exam immediately after finishing the course.

- 1.4 Some CC study materials that I have compiled when studying CC https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CRM9tWknpLyM7jZgDOk1XmCLbx4xVb3. For me personally, after finishing ISC2 CC, I continued to study ISC2 SSCP and have not taken the ISC2 CC exam. (continued in section 2)

- 1.5 Some personal experiences after studying and taking the ISC2 CC exam:

- ISC2 exam questions often emphasize the candidate's mindset. If candidates memorize the practice exam questions, the risk of failing the exam is very high. Candidates need to clearly understand the concepts, compare, and distinguish the concepts. In a question with 4 answers, in addition to choosing the correct answer, candidates must clearly understand why the remaining 3 answers are wrong.

- If you self-study using https://www.isc2.org/training/online-self-paced/cc-online-self-paced, this amount of knowledge is not enough to pass the ISC2 CC exam. - You can register for additional courses (with fees) to supplement your knowledge:

He feels I will regret it and that’s why he had me make this post because he says I’m going to hurt a lot of people and thinking emotionally but not logically. 

Girl A is my dream girl and I knew her since middle school. I’ve always had a crush on her but she wasn’t interested, I’ll even say in a lot of cases she was mean to me. I was bullied in school and she would join in on the bullying. If we were alone at the bus stop she was nice but the moment others were around she ignored me or joined in on the bullying. I never stopped my crush on her but I accepted this would never happen. 

Fast forward to college , I meet girl B. She’s great, we click instantly have the same interest, hobbies, and did everything together. She essentially became my best friend, I had no idea she had feelings for me but one day she told me she likes me. She also said we spend all our time together we might as well date.  We got along and been together 6 years now and I proposed in January. Concurrently I finished my masters and get a really great job. 

Girl A comes back in the picture because we followed each other on instagram and I decided to add her to my close friends. I posted my job offer with the salary and she congratulated me. This led to her apologizing for bullying me in school. We started catching up and got coffee and she said she has a crush on me!!!!!! I said I need time to think because I would never disrespect my fiancée. 

I talked to my friend and he’s strongly opposed to me trying things with Girl A. He suspects she’s just using me for my money. I agree that is potentially the case but doubt it because of our childhood connection. He says I will regret leaving my fiancée but I think I will regret not trying things with girl A. I love my fiancée but I get women like my fiancée who are interested in me all the time, this the first time a woman like girl A has shown interest and I gotta see it through. 


My friend strongly disagree and that’s why he convinced me to make this post. Im open to different opinions but I am leaning on trying things with girl A.",0,1738370709.0,relationship_advice,17,0.33,False

1ieu5qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ieu5qc/i_havent_slept_since_2023/,I haven't slept since 2023,"Growing up, I had two choices in life. I could follow in my father’s footsteps as a farm equipment maintenance worker. It was a decent job, with decent pay, but I always got this sense of dread whenever I walked by his workshop. It was this big windowless building in a pale green color, and I always had this feeling that if I stayed there for too long, that place would eat me alive.

So I went with the other choice in life – my mother. She was always larger than life, and she wanted me to be too. She was all about the hustle. When she and my father went separate ways, she took me and my sister across the country to Bangkok. She was the embodiment of “ot prieo wai kin waan”, roughly translated to “endure the sourness, and enjoy the sweetness later”. She would take any job, at any time, and claw her way upward.

So my sister and I turned out the same. We would work, study, and socialize. We were supposed to be everything at once – smart, strong, cultural, and opinionated.

 

I studied computer science at night and worked delivery during the day. I got a pretty good eye for traffic, so I can make it around the city without fearing for my life. That’s easier said than done. Traffic laws around here seem to be more of a suggestion rather than law.

I also did the odd job making websites for friends, family, and acquaintances. That would eat up most of my weekend nights. And finally, the one job that never paid me anything – looking out for my sister.

My sister Isara worked as a club and event promoter in the inner city. She mostly worked weekends and nights, and I’m the only one she trusts to watch her back. If someone bothered her, I’d be on call. If she needed a sudden ride home, I’d be on call. I’d get yelled at for being late, or for not responding fast enough, or for a thousand different reasons. It was, by far, the worst job I’d ever had – but family is family.

 

I would be working so much that the only time my friends would see me was when I came around to pick up Isara. They started to call me เลิก, or ”Lerk” – something you say when it’s time to close for the night. I was the closing time-guy. When I showed up, it was time to go home. Not the most fun nickname to be stuck with in your early 20’s.

When my mother passed from pancreatic cancer in 2020, I’d just turned 21. I was put in a position where I had to support both myself and my sister economically. Sure, she pulled part of her weight too, but she was looking ahead. She wanted to work in cosmetology – especially in movies and TV shows. That would take money and time.

So for a while there, I had a lot of sudden weight put on my shoulders. Studies, work, work, more work, and being there for Isara.

 

I barely slept, and when I did, I’d wake up at the slightest sound. I was so used to sleeping lightly, waiting for my sister to call for a pickup. But I didn’t have a lot of choice. I had to keep going, for everyone’s sake. So I made a plan – I just had to make it until I was done with my studies.

I looked for temporary solutions. I’d take caffeine pills, but they ended up giving me a stomachache. I tried this dextrose drink from a local pharmacy, but that thing almost gave me arrythmia. I didn’t want to try any heavier stuff, so I kind of gave up hope.

Then I met a guy named Somyot.

 

Somyot is a nice guy in the wrong kind of business. About ten years older than me, but thirty years older at heart. To this day, I’m not sure what he really does, apart from co-managing a couple of downtown clubs. I think he buys things from places you shouldn’t, some kind of gray area importer.

He was a part-owner of a club where Isara worked on the weekend. The first time I met him, he was sitting outside the club with a cold beer, having a cigarette. He didn’t look like the owner, so I sat down next to him to tie my shoes. He looked me up and down.

“You just gonna sit down like that?” he asked. “You got an appointment?”

“I need an appointment for a chair?”

“For my chair, yeah.”

“You the boss?”

“I’m a boss, yeah.”

I was too tired to care, and frankly, getting my sister fired from that place would’ve made my life easier. So I looked right back at him.

“You don’t look like a boss to me.”

I didn’t know if he was gonna hit me or hire me. But he ended up belly laughing and offering me a cigarette, so I guess I made the right choice.

 

I would spend about one or two nights a week at Somyot’s club. He’d offer me a job, but the pay was awful, and I was busy with other things. I literally didn’t have enough hours of the day to work for him. I think that was for the best though – he was a great guy to hang out with, but he must’ve been an awful boss. Cheap bastard.

Somyot had some sympathy for me though. I was working hard to make ends meet, and he respected the hustle. He offered me a couple of side gigs. For example, picking up leftover credit cards at ATMs. There’s a kind of ATM that takes a long (long!) time for the card to come back out, so a lot of tourists think it ate them - so they leave the card behind. Somyot paid a little for each card I could bring him, so I would walk around and pick them up while waiting for Isara to finish work. Every little bit helps.

We developed a good friendship. I would show up an hour or so before Isara needed a pickup just to hang out with Somyot. We’d usually just talk about movies, cars, girls… whatever came to mind. I didn’t have a lot of people in my life I could just talk to about nothing, and I don’t think he did either. We’d usually end up having a beer and chew betel nuts. They’re these nuts that you wrap in a leaf and chew, it gives you a pick-me-up that makes your mouth burn. It sums up  Somyot pretty well – legal, but spicy.

But things took a turn when I was invited to a private party of his.

 

See, I’d been up for 27 hours straight at that point. I’d been working on a large project for my computer science class, and I’d been trying to get a couple of extra hours in at the delivery company. That, and a client needed me to redo their homepage after it got hacked. It was a perfect storm of a lot of little things, all at once, and it drove me to exhaustion.

But I still got to Somyot’s party. He had a nice place outside of town. He’d invited some people from the club, and some business associates. He had these parties about once every six months or so – it was a way to show appreciation and brag a little.

Still, Somyot had pulled out all the stops. He’d felt sorry for me, seeing me work so hard, and he’d brought a guy there from a research institute. They needed people for a data entry job, and he thought it’d be my kind of thing. Problem is, I was so tired I looked like I was on drugs. I didn’t even understand the guy was offering me a paid position.

 

As the party died down, Somyot took me aside and sat me down for a chat. We chewed some betel nuts, and he took off his sunglasses. The man didn’t look me in the eyes a lot, so I knew something was up.

“I worry about you,” he said. “You’re working too hard.”

“I’m sorry,” I said. “It’s not that I don’t appreciate this, but I had so much to do.”

“Then tell me,” he continued. “Tell me how I can help.”

“You don’t need to do anything,” I said. “I’m just glad to have a friend, you know?”

I could see the wheels turn in his head. His eyes welled up a little. He gave me a hug and took me out to the veranda overlooking the city. He patted me on the back.

“You deserve better,” he said. “I’ll get you something better.”

 

The following weekend, I got a text from Somyot. He was excited to show me something. He usually had something to share, but this time seemed different. I was a bit anxious about seeing him, but it was a nice change of pace.

So that Saturday, I was invited into the club. I went straight past the bouncer, through the dance floor, and into the back rooms. From there, I followed a corridor to a small office at the back of the building. After all I’d seen from Somyot I expected something grander, but it was just a little office with an old laptop, a USB fan, a couple chairs and a shitty TV in the corner. All accentuated by a couple of early 2000’s posters of women in bikinis posing with cars.

Somyot was smiling ear to ear and waved me over. He opened a safe under his desk and pulled out a small box of white pill bottles. They were all sealed and unmarked, except for a small blue sunflower print on the cap.

 

He sat me down and took a bottle out of his pocket to show me.

“This is gonna help,” he said. “Trust me.”

“I don’t do drugs, boss.”

“I know you don’t. This isn’t that.”

He showed me his phone and a conversation he’d had with the guy from the party – the one from the research institute. Apparently, he’d managed to get his hands on a couple of cases of an off-market stimulant.

 

“I tried it myself,” he said. “Going on two weeks now, it’s a little miracle.”

“What does it do? What’s the catch?”

“No need to sleep anymore,” he smiled. “One pill, you’re good for at least… 18 hours.”

“No way.”

“You might need another hour or two to recover when you finally go to bed, but apart from that, it’s perfect. Doesn’t make your piss smell, doesn’t fuck up your hair, nothing.”

“No way,” I repeated. “Too good to be true.”

Somyot sat down at his desk across from me, giving me a long look.

“You won’t let me get you a better job,” he said. “Let me get you this. As a friend.”

 

I could tell he was being genuine. You could say a lot about Somyot, but he’d always been honest with me. I swallowed my fears and picked up one of the pills.

“I don’t know,” I said. “There’s gotta be a catch.”

“Never more than one a day,” he said. “Or you’ll get sick. And no more than two days at a time. Maybe three, but then you’ll probably get a headache. Oh, and no drugs.”

“What do you mean?”

“There’s a list of things drugs it reacts with. But you don’t do that stuff, so you’re good.”

“What about caffeine?”

“As long as you don’t pour stuff like…”

 

Somyot picked up a small piece of paper and looked it over, reading from a list.

“…arecoline, cocaine hydrochloride, diacetylmorphine, or methamphetamine, you’re good.”

“There goes my Friday night.”

“Funny,” Somyot scoffed. “If you don’t want it, it’s fine, but-“

“No, no, I’ll try one.”

And so I did.

 

Taking that first pill was like breathing in after a deep dive. I felt lighter, but not high. I was just well-rested; ready to take on the day. But there was also a slight chill to it, like a cold breath sweeping across my nerves. I looked at Somyot like I was seeing him for the first time. He got up and slapped his hands together with a grin.

“I knew it!” he said. “I knew this’d be it!”

“How much?” I asked. “For a bottle. How much?”

“Take it,” he smiled, pushing over the whole case. “Guy owed me a favor.”

“Really, you’re just giving it away?”

“I’m just glad to have a friend.”

 

That night was the first time I stuck around to party with Somyot, for real. The man was a force of nature. He’d down shots like they were water. He knew all the best food vendors on the block by name, and he’d ping-pong from after-party to after-party without breaking a sweat. I was just along for the ride. We ended up drunk on a bench, watching the sun rise. Not a blink of tiredness in our eyes – our day was just getting started. No need for betel nuts to keep us going. I wouldn’t need those ever again.

“Next, you’re getting a woman,” he murmured. “Then a job. A great job.”

“You can fix anything, huh?”

“That’s why I’m the *boss*.”

“I don’t wanna owe you anything,” I said. “You get that, right?”

“You don’t owe me anything.”

“Kinda feels like I do.”

 

He asked me to show him my phone. I did, and he scrolled down to his number on the contact list. He tapped it, hovering his finger over the ‘delete’ button.

“You can delete me today and never call me again, and that’s up to you.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

He handed me the phone back and turned his attention to the sun.

“But for as long as you feel like it, I’m here,” he continued. “No strings.”

“No strings?”

He shrugged and slid his final beer my way.

“It’s just nice to be the good guy for once.”

 

The next night, lying in my bed, I was scared. I had no idea how my body would respond. It was a make-or-break moment where I’d find out if Somyot had screwed me over, or if he’d really helped me out. I had a whole case of those pills stashed away in the closet, more than enough to keep me going for months. But I took his advice; every 2 or 3 days or so, I’d give it a rest.

So when I went to sleep that night, I didn’t know what to expect.

I had strange dreams. I dreamt I woke up in this barren world, with a dead tree towering in the distance. There were no stars in the sky. It was desolate, but peaceful, in a way. And I dreamt that there was someone there, in the dark. Someone looking for me.

But I woke up long before they found me. I was a bit worked up, but it was just a dream. Those fleeting images rolled out of my mind faster than it took for me to make breakfast. From that moment on, I decided to give these things a go.

 

I would rest every 3 days or so, but until then, I was constantly on the go. I could work as many hours as I wanted. I could be up all night, finishing projects left and right. I never missed a call from Isara. I could keep up with demands, and I could do it comfortable – without side effects.

Sure, whenever I crashed, I’d dream about that place again. The dead tree, reaching for the moon. The desolate ruins. And somewhere, out in the eternal night, something was looking for me. But it never had the time to find me – I’d always wake up long before it did.

It was comfortable. Efficient. And I could do it all.

 

I had time to work a little with Somyot. Not anything big, just odd jobs here and there. He was fair, but didn’t pay much – but then again, I was making more money than I knew how to spend.

I got a second chance at an interview with Somyot’s guy at the research institute, and that time around – I nailed it. It was just a low-level data entry job, but I could do it remotely, and it paid almost twice as much as my delivery job. I had to brush up on my English, but that wasn’t a big deal. Isara and I had to learn it early on in our lives – my mother made sure of it.

Isara had saved up enough money for her cosmetology classes, so I got some more time to focus on other things. I invested some time in a start-up app with some guys from my classes, and we made some solid progress.

 

Overall, things looked pretty good. Weeks turned to months, and months eventually turned to an entire year. I still had plenty of pills left, and I got into a healthy routine. I slept better, I ate better, and I had so much more time on my hands. It got to the point where I couldn’t imagine going back to life without those pills.

Still, I couldn’t help but wonder what that place in between the wakeful world and my dreams was. That place in the starless night, with the dead tree in the distance. Who were the dark shapes roaming the fields of black sand, and who was out there, looking at me?

I wouldn’t think about it too much. I chalked it up as a weird side-effect, but not much else. It didn’t affect my everyday life, so why should I care?

 

Fast-forward to 2023. I was co-owner of a small company. No more data entry. We had an office and five employees. My nickname still stuck around, but it was more or less sarcastic. I was no longer the guy who showed up at the end of it all – I was the first in line. I would plan my come-downs in a way that people never noticed. I had this reputation of working around the clock, and people just couldn’t figure it out. I didn’t share my secret with anyone. I figured there would be some serious consequences if those pills got in the wrong hands.

My sister worked got a nice job at one of the local malls. One of the really big ones, not just any old mall. It was very well paid, and she could support herself more than enough. She ended up moving in with a guy, and I got a place of my own. I could finally take a step up and get myself something nice.

I still spent time with Somyot. He was the only other person in the world that knew of the pills. He’d stopped taking them though; he found them too distracting when it came to keeping a schedule. He was going steady with a lady named Wanwan, and he hated seeing her go to bed on her own. It was surprisingly sweet. And more pills for me, so, win-win.

In February of 2023, my sister got married. It was bad timing, since I had a huge project to work on at the time. So even with all my available time, it was still not enough. So I had to do something Somyot advised against; I had to keep going for five days straight. Just two days more than the ordinary three, but still.

 

Now, I didn’t immediately notice anything. It worked just fine. But when I finally crashed, after almost a full week without sleep, I had the most awful nightmare of my life.

Not only was I back there, in that desolate space, I could *feel* it. The black sand creeping into my shoes. The howling of people in pain. I thought I heard gunfire, too. What little vegetation lived there was twisted into a midnight blue; just like the blue sunflower on the cap of the bottle.

But this time, there wasn’t just something in the dark, looking for me. No, it was *hunting*.

 

I have this vivid memory of crawling through the sands of an old ruin, hearing something closing in. Despite the sand, it was wet. Viscous. It made this disgusting sound, like a crowd of large men struggling for breath all at once. I would hear it touch its way across the ruins, looking for me, and everywhere it touched – something sizzled, like burning acid.

It tried to speak. I know it did, but it couldn’t. It had too many tongues, and they all tried to speak at once.

Eventually, it found me.

I couldn’t look. I couldn’t breathe. I could feel the size of it without even looking as it loomed over me. I tried making myself small, but it didn’t matter. It sighed, like it had enjoyed a cold glass of water on a warm summer’s day. It was so *pleased* to find me. And as it moved closer, I heard something dripping – sizzling into the sand. There was a powerful smell of ammonia and something akin to moth balls.

It touched my arm, and it burned into my skin. It burned so bad that I woke up.

And when I did, I had a burn. A coin-sized black mark with gangrenous flesh tightening the skin of the arm, stinging with every flex of my triceps.

That place was real. That thing had been *real*.

 

For a full week after that, I kept feeling like I’d been seconds from death. I had a doctor check out my arm, but he couldn’t make sense of it. It was an acid burn, but it behaved like a frostbite. In the end, he had to make a small procedure to remove the necrotized skin, but it was overall fine. I just had to keep it clean and bandaged – and be prepared for a nasty scar.

But that thing had been so vivid. Days later,  I could still smell it. I remember this one time when I was taking a shower, when I had to turn off the water. I thought I heard something sizzling in the other room. Wrapped in a towel I peeked through the door, hoping against hope that I was just being paranoid.

That time, I was. But what about next time?

 

I swore off the pills. I was in a good place, and I didn’t need them anymore. I’d gained everything I wanted. Sure, it’d take some time to get back to a normal schedule, but I couldn’t go back there. No wonder we weren’t supposed to take more than 2 or 3 pills in a sequence, if I’d been there a second longer it would’ve taken my whole arm. Another hour, and I’d be dead.

I decided to give it all back to Somyot.

By that time, he had expanded his business a bit – but he’d calmed down as a person. He was a changed man. He was engaged to Wanwan, and he was trying to turn his life around. In fact, we hadn’t seen each other for some time. He was a bit surprised when I called about meeting him in his office.

 

I met Somyot in his downtown office late one Friday night. It was a strange feeling. There were people everywhere, but I still felt like I was alone. There was this thought crawling around in the back of my head, whispering to me that if I slowed down, and really listened, I could hear that sizzling acid as it burned into the asphalt.

So I kept my head down and tried to get into the music. The bass. The beat of the party. But it was all just superficial. I couldn’t help but think back on that thing. Every time I heard a cough, a sneeze, someone clearing their throat, I thought that was it. It found me. I could feel the squelch of it in my ear, almost like a heat.

But I made my way through the club and joined Somyot in his office. I put the pills on his desk and sat down across from him.

“I’m done with them,” I said.

“They do something to you?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “I’m just… I’m done.”

“Alright, no worries,” Somyot nodded. “You okay?”

“Not really.”

 

Despite not hanging out for a while, Somyot was his usual self. He put the pills away, sat down next to me, and handed me a beer. He’d installed a mini-fridge next to his desk. The damn thing made more noise than his ceiling fan.

“I’m not gonna ask about it,” he said. “You look like shit.”

“I feel like shit.”

“What happened to your arm?”

“Frostbite.”

Somyot snorted but saw that I wasn’t laughing. He opened his mouth, but closed it again. Whatever had happened to me, he knew better than to laugh. Instead he leaned over, looking worried.

“Fuck the pills,” he said. “You’re sticking with me now, alright?”

“Alright.”

 

He made his best effort to keep me company that night. We had drinks, met some people, and sang some karaoke. I almost got into an arm-wrestling competition with a drunk Dutch guy. It was nice – and for a moment, I didn’t hear those awful noises. I didn’t smell those smells.

Later that night, I could feel myself growing tired. Usually, I would pop one of the pills, but I settled for a classic instead; betel nuts. Somyot and I wrapped them up and bit down. It was nice to feel that familiar crunch and burn. It was a return to form, in a way. It was the way things were supposed to be.

By the end of the night, we ended up on that same bench, watching the sun. But this time, he was exhausted. He was nodding off over and over as he waited for a friend to pick him up. I was, strangely, not tired in the slightest.

“Maybe you still got some of it in your system,” Somyot mumbled. “Makes sense, right? Bigger doses take longer.”

“Probably,” I nodded. “Or maybe it was the nuts.”

“Nah, they don’t work like that. They’re a kick, not a trip.”

By the time Somyot’s friend came around to pick him up, he could barely keep his eyes open. He lumbered into the passenger seat and looked back at me one final time.

“I’m getting rid of them,” he said. “Don’t worry. It’s done. You’ll be fine.”

 

But I wasn’t feeling fine. Or rather; I was. But that was the problem.

I went home, and I still couldn’t sleep. I went an entire day, and I still couldn’t sleep. I hadn’t taken any pills for some time, but I was still up and about. I was getting worried, but I didn’t know where to turn. Had I taken a pill by accident?

I reached out to Somyot’s contact at the research institute. But we couldn’t talk about it over e-mail, since it was monitored, and this was hardly legal. So we decided to meet downtown later in the week.

 

For the next few days, I was a wreck. I kept thinking about that place and that thing. I’d been up for so many days that I didn’t want to think about what would happen when I returned. It would be waiting for me. I could feel it. Hear it.

I met the man from the research institute an early morning. I paid for his coffee, but I didn’t get any myself. He was an American in his 50’s with a shaved head and a well-trimmed goatee. He hid behind a black baseball cap and wasn’t much for small talk. I decided to get right to it.

I explained the problem. After taking a larger than usual dose, I couldn’t sleep anymore. He didn’t look that surprised.

“That only happens when you take stimulants,” he said. “Didn’t he warn you?”

“I haven’t taken anything,” I said. “I don’t do drugs.”

“You sure?” he asked. “Nothing?”

“Does alcohol count?” I asked. “Betel nuts? Caffeine?”

“What? No, that-“

 

He stopped for a second. His eyes turned away as he thought about it. He brought out his phone and checked something, then nodded.

“Betel nuts,” he repeated. “That’s high in arecoline.”

“High in what?”

“Arecoline. That’s the first thing on the list. That’s the worst one.”

“Wait, what?”

He adjusted his glasses and read the list out loud. He was right – arecoline was the first thing on the list. Right there next to hard narcotics.

“What does it mean?” I asked. “What’s gonna happen?”

 

He leaned back in his chair, sipped his coffee, and adjusted his glasses.

“We made this in our lab back in Vietnam. When the lab got shut down, it was scheduled to be burned. But we never got around to it.”

“So you make drugs? Is that it?”

“It’s not a drug,” he explained. “It isolates a particular chemical element. It was originally made to nurture a type of deep-sea fish to gestate a kind of rough metal powder.”

“What? Fish? I don’t-“

“Look, it’s not a stimulant. It’s not a drug. It puts a part of you in another place, and while it’s there, your body becomes disconnected from a few of your basic needs. In most cases, sleep.”

“So what does it mean? What’s gonna happen to me?”

 

He leaned forward, looking over the edge of his silver-rimmed glasses.

“Arecoline amplifies the effect by a magnitude of about… a hundred. It’s one of the reasons they had to shut down the development. At that magnitude, there’s no telling what’s gonna happen.”

“Wait, a hundred? So I’m going to-“

“You’re gonna be awake for… maybe a year. Maybe four. And then something I can’t even imagine is going to happen to you.”

 

There was nothing else to say. He had no advice to give, there were no solutions. The damage was done. I almost burst into tears right then and there. My hands were shaking. I would be awake for years, and then… something. Something he couldn’t even imagine. If the effect of two pills too many caught me a burn on the arm, what the hell was going to happen after a hundred? Two hundred?

The bandage itched, and I could hear the sizzling from a nearby kitchen. But it wasn’t from the kitchen.

It was that thing. And it was waiting for me. It was just a matter of time.

 

I tried everything, but there was nothing to be done. There was nothing wrong with me, on paper. I was healthier than ever, in fact. The lab in Vietnam that the man spoke off had been shut down, and all traces of it was dismantled. I had a vague lead to an investor in the U.S, but it didn’t lead me anywhere.

I had to sell my share in the company. It stung, but the payout was more than generous. It would keep me afloat for a couple of months, maybe a year, while I tried to work something out.

But it was a desperate search for nothing. Even the man from the research institute would drop off the grid. And when strange men in suits started asking my friends and family about me, I knew I’d taken a step too far.

 

This was in February, 2023. Every day from that point forward has been a nightmare.

In May that same year, I lost the need to eat. It’s like my body entered a kind of metastasis. I could sit in a room for days on end, staring at a wall, and nothing would change. I would feel nothing. I would experience nothing. And I wouldn’t care. And with no food, I’d need no bathroom breaks.

Sometime in July, I lost the need to breathe. I would forget to do it for days on end, and my lungs would deflate to the point where it hurt to use them. After a couple of weeks, I couldn’t talk without bleeding anymore.

In late October that year, I stopped blinking. I would forget to do it for long periods of time, and dust would settle in my eyes. It didn’t hurt, but it was uncomfortable to wash them, so I just ended up keeping them closed.

Something happened to my skin. I think it stopped needing sunlight. Over a couple of days I grew so pale you could almost see through me.

My fingernails would fall off. Without using my mouth and jaw, my teeth fell out of my skull.

I barely noticed.

 

I had to move in with my sister to care for me. She couldn’t understand what was happening, and neither could anyone else. She would force me to go to the doctors, and they couldn’t make sense of it. Whenever they mentioned “specialists”, some anonymous group would throw enough money at them to look the other way.

But all of that was just cake topping. It was all just physical things. It didn’t compare to my thoughts, and feelings.

I would feel closer and closer to that dark place. That space beyond, where that thing waited for me. It *hungered* for me. All the needs and wants I’d lost, it’d gained. It was hungry, tired, sunburnt, and in constant pain. And it wanted to give it all back to me. To *consume* me with it. If I just listened hard enough, I could hear it panting.

Like an eager dog waiting for master to put food in his bowl. Ready to tear into me, unashamed.

 

Sometimes I forget what world I’m in. I’ll get up and wander around, feeling the walls, imagining them as crumbling ruins. My sister once caught me wandering into the street. If my lungs had worked, she would’ve heard me begging that thing to leave me. Instead, I got hit by a car. And I didn’t feel a thing, laying crumbled into a pile by the side of the road.

The things people say feel like a distant dream. I have no need for serotonin, so joy is something of the past. Sometimes I can hear the music and cheering across the city, but it feels like they’re mocking me. But the fear – that’s still there. It may be the only emotion that remains.

 

Now it’s 2025. I think I attended Somyot’s wedding, but I can’t know for sure. I think I was there. I didn’t see or hear. I can’t feel anything when I move my arms anymore. There was a nice smell. I think he offered me some cake. I tried to smile at him, but I don’t know if I did it.

I’ve written this with great effort over several weeks. My sister has helped. She washes my eyes, and I would look at the letters for her to type. If I stretch a little, I can get enough air in my lungs to make a noise, or a short word.

Sometimes at night, when my sister is not here, I think I can hear something outside. Not just in my mind, but on the street. I think they are watching me. I think they’re curious about what happens when I got to sleep.

Or maybe they’re scared.

 

It’s funny in a way. They called me Lerk – closing time. It’s fitting. I can’t help but think I should’ve stayed with my father, maintaining farm equipment. I wish I could dream of seeing those pale green walls again.

I had to finish this in a hurry. I think the effect is wearing off, like the man said it would.

Yesterday, I yawned. Today, I’m tired.

For background, I applied for a front desk receptionist job for a start up company that opened in my city in November 2024.

During my interview, I asked if she (the recruiter and owner) was open to creating internship opportunities for the summer, and she thought that was an amazing question and said she was definitely going to do it, and would write down that I was interested. 

I didnt end up getting the front desk job, as there were other candidates that had better front desk experience, but she contacted me and said that she would love to have a coffee chat with me soon to talk about the internship opportunities. And then she asked when I was free on the 3rd week of February 

I responded back about an hour later and told her my availability. But she hasn’t responded since. That was almost a week ago. I dont know if I should let her know through Linkedin that i’m still interested or not. She is not the best communicator through email as we had to reschedule my interview because she lost the email (and bc of the lack of not having a receptionist to organize her workload) but I feel like she would have remembered me if she actually wanted me to work for her.

I haven’t had the best experience with internships, this would be my first internship as a junior, so I really need this opportunity. I’m so close to getting it but at the same time I’m not. I don’t want to sound desperate but I lowkey am🥲 I want this internship so bad but I don’t want to come off as pushy. Idk what to do or if I should text her again to remind her.

The feeling of not thinking about food ALL the time is wild. I had doubts, but when I’m bored I don’t find myself scoping the pantry for options. I have also noticed consuming less carbs and wanting to focus on high protein. 

Making sure I’m hydrated has been hard, but I’m doing it. Yesterday I started 1:1. I took my second pill at 9pm, which seems useless? But I guess if you’re trying to build up the drug in your system, this is how it works?

I got out and ordered a coffee, it was the best coffee.  So sweet, of the principal.  She said the PTO, will do this 2 times a year.  VERY NICE!

1ieu43v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ieu43v/crazy_inlaw_drama_llama/,Crazy In-Law Drama Llama,"Hi Charlotte! I have been watching your videos for a VERY long time (over 3 years now!!) and I absolutely adore your takes on everything drama related. I never thought I’d be in the place to write one of my own, but here we go 😅 

Please bear with me, this is going to be a VERY long story, and even when it being so long a lot of context has been left out. Ages and other things have been changed for privacy, but I swear to you I have screenshots to prove the nasty things that have been said about and to me. 

To sum it up, my in-laws hate me. All of them. I am the wicked woman who stole my husband from them. Now obviously, that is the furthest thing from the truth. My husband is a grown man who makes decisions on his own (with my opinion and input obviously, but he makes his own decisions!), but his family refuse to be believe it. Anywho. Here we go: 

My husband (28m) and I (24f) have been married since November of 2020. (We met right after I started my junior year of college at 19, and after multiple health issues & surgeries on top of COVID taking over the world, we fell in love fast and hard. Met to dating to engaged to married in less than a year, I planned our wedding in 6 weeks) At first, his family absolutely loved me. I used to brag about how I would NEVER have to worry about the toxic MIL stereotype when we got married. We had coffee dates & girls nights & everything. There were a few red flags sure, but everyone has them. I brushed them off for the most part, my husband didn't seem to mind so neither did I. Until things took a nasty turn.

We decided to start our family very shortly after our wedding. With family history of infertility and multiple chronic illnesses on my side, we knew we truly only had a few years if we wanted to have our own biological children. (Yes, we had multiple conversations about all of our options, we ultimately decided on what was best for us. I've wanted to be a mom as long as I can remember. I've had a list of baby names on my phone since I was 12, as I'm sure most of you women can relate to.) We go 8 months with absolutely no luck, so I see my obgyn. They recommend us to a fertility clinic, and since we had so much family history of miscarriages and infertility, we were seen right away. When I tell you they did every single test in the book, I am not joking. They did a full genetic panel on both of us, an HSG on me, multiple procedures, thousands of needle pokes and blood tests, countless ultrasounds, and thousands of dollars.

To sum our infertility journey up: We ultimately tried for over 2 years, some time with the clinic and some without. 4 lUls - one worked but ended in a miscarriage. The rest failed. My health took over, landed me in the hospital multiple times, and made the decision for us. I cannot carry a child anytime soon, if ever. We decided 2 months before our daughter's due date that we would not be actively trying for children anymore. If a miracle happens, we'll be so happy. But if not, we love being auntie and uncle to our massive amount of children in our lives. It was a very hard decision, but ended up being for the best. My side of the family were really supportive. My mom & stepmom always made me feel loved even when I couldn't understand why my body was failing in the one place it's literally made for. His family, however, completely ignored us. Or worse, they would make passive aggressive comments about how husbands sister should be having kids first, how we're too young for kids, how ""it's all in gods timing"", ""everything happens for a reason"" when I miscarried our daughter, and the worst, silence.
My husband counted the messages that went unanswered, it was over a dozen. My procedures, horrible news good news, anything in between - just ignored.

June 2022 will forever be burned into my brain. I am very vocal on my social media about my beliefs, and when women’s rights were taken, I made a post. I was so devastated at the thought of never having children (the threat it made to IVF which is our only option to conceive), and felt the need to speak my voice. Husband and I were staying with his parents due to an issue in our house, and when his mother saw my post, all hell broke loose.

She took my post and used it to throw in my husband's face some of the foulest things I have ever heard in my life. I will not go into details because it makes me want to puke, but know she told her only son that his life was worthless (yes, she used those words), and told him that his wife is going to cheat on him (because of my sexuality, I am Pan not that it matters to literally anyone, l've been committed to my husband since the day he asked me to be his girlfriend), and many other cruel things. I was present out of eyesight for half of the conversation, but left for work in the middle of it. I heard with my own ears these things she said to him.
He stood up for me, our marriage, our daughter, and our future children, and walked away. After they went to bed, at 1 am he went to the room we were staying, packed all of our stuff in the car and left. We have been shifting between low no contact since then. I have been no contact since that day, but my husband is low contact with his parents at the moment. 

Every decision regarding his family has been made by him. I know I will always be the wicked woman who 'stole precious husband from his family' in their eyes, and l've learned to cope with it, but it is really hard when family members keep contacting me after blocking them constantly. There is a family member I have blocked on multiple accounts, multiple times, who will not stop messaging me on my BUSINESS account. I have gotten an 18 (yes, eighteen) page digital letter from this person, multiple messages calling me pathetic and a loser, threatening to reach out to my family because ""no sane person would act like this"". I'm honestly just sick of it. My husband is a grown man, he makes his own decisions. I don't know what goes on in other people's marriages, but I do know that in mine, neither controls the other. We have complete open communication, and he is free to contact literally anyone he wants. I have actually pushed him a few times in the last few years to meet with his parents, and every time he says no. He is very firm in his boundaries, and I am so proud of him for that. He stood up for me to his family, and because of that he lost all of them. He is the best partner, he takes care of me and the house, and is active in my family. My family adores him, and welcomed him with open arms. 

Someone who used to be very close to him just had another baby. With my own stuff going on, I cannot handle it. I am so happy for them, but devastated for myself. I have had to grieve a future that never existed. Every day I wake up and for just a second I look for my baby, until reality hits in and my arms are empty. My husband is the same way, and is hurting as deep as I am. He is seeing a family he hasn't been a part of in over two years, and I cannot imagine the pain he is going through.
I guess what I need is advice. I know I will forever be the villain in their story, and l've come to terms with that, but the guilt of being the reason my husband doesn't have his family is something that eats at me in the dark of night.

How can I cope with this? I know it's something I just have to get over, and with time it will get easier, but grieving the loss of my husbands family while they're still alive has been one of the hardest things we’ve ever done. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for your time.

Great start to a Run right? 

What’s actually happened is I spawned at Pillars Footrest, got Kerb Stomped by a Moose Twice! I’ve got no medicine. 
I managed to hobble my way to the Prepper Cache…it’s Fully stocked thank god. I’ve got 2 broken ribs and I’m on my dying breath. 

There’s so much loot and luckily I find medicine and patch my self up. 

Now the issue is it says I can’t climb for 168 hours! That’s like 7 days. So I can’t get to the gold mine and my travel paths are kinda limited.

1ieu1d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1ieu1d3/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

So, I’m terrible at writing these things, but here goes! 👋 I’m a 24-year-old guy living near Cologne, Germany (born and raised here, never left—it’s home!). I’ve got long dark brown hair, I’m kinda slim (175cm/5’7”, 65kg/143), and I *try* to stay active by cycling and playing badminton… though I’m definitely not winning any tournaments anytime soon. 😂

**Here’s the deal:**

* I’m a **hardcore gamer**—like, *all* genres. RPGs, shooters, indie stuff… you name it, I’ll probably play it. When I’m not gaming, I’m glued to **TV shows, movies, or anime** (currently rewatching *G*ame of Thrones. **\*SPOILER\*** >!im sure Ned survives this time!<).
* **Metalhead alert!** 🎸 Concerts and festivals are my jam. Also, I’m that friend who’s always down for a weekend party (beer included, obviously).
* **Personality-wise:** I’m *super* shy at first—think “quiet listener mode”—but once I warm up, I’ll rant about *anything* (philosophy, games, why pineapple on pizza is a crime…or is it?). I *love* hearing other people’s takes too!
* Politically? Middle-of-the-road, but I care about social stuff. No religion for me, but I respect yours if you have one!
* **Languages:** German is my mother tongue, I’m fluent in English, and I know *just* enough Swedish to order a coffee (or apologize for my terrible accent).

**Looking for someone:**

* A woman aged **20–26** who’s into *some* of the same stuff (gaming, metal, deep talks), but I’m totally game to try new things too!
* Bonus points if you’re patient with introverts. 😅 I’ve tried dating apps before, but they feel… *meh*. Let’s skip the small talk and bond over something real?

**If you’re still reading this…**  
Thanks for sticking around! Shoot me a message if any of this resonates—or just to roast my badminton skills. 🏸

I met with her in another event. Everything fine. Later we met to draw while we sat in a coffee shop. However, I did not like her attitude, she spoke a lot, I do not know if she listened to what I said to her. 

She started to speak to me about her taste in movies, I shared some of those, but she had a strange fixation with creepy topics such as a movie of a guy marrying a minor and she is always focusing on the violence of that type of content and find her way of analyzing those topics a way too surface level, which makes me uncomfortable. I am not a saint, I watch a lot of horror movies but I do not like the way this person subtracts importance from characters that are possible victims.

It’s time-consuming, overwhelming, and somehow, you always end up with more stuff than you thought. But what if you could make the process easier with a few smart packing hacks? 🤔

Here are some game-changing tips to help you pack smarter, not harder:

✅ Use what you already have – Towels, blankets, and socks make great padding for fragile items.
✅ Label like a pro – Color-code or number your boxes to match rooms for an effortless unpacking process.
✅ Keep essentials separate – Pack a “first-night” box with everything you’ll need right away (think charger, toiletries, and coffee ☕).
✅ Hanger hack – No need to remove clothes from hangers—just bundle them in trash bags for an instant closet transfer.
✅ DIY handles – Cut hand holes into heavy boxes to make them easier to carry.

1ietij2,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1ietij2/always_make_the_walk/,Always make the walk!,"This is my story of commuter karma. 

A little over a year ago, I was a regional FO on day 2 of a trip. We had a 3 hour sit, and shortly before boarding, I went up the jet bridge to grab coffee. And I checked to see if we had any commuters. We had two, and two open seats. I told them I’d be looking for them before we’d push. Worked out nicely, right? Wrong. 

The two open seats were in first class. And apparently there was a made up policy (that wouldn’t apply to our regional either) where jumpseaters couldn’t occupy a first class seat. So one guy got cleared on, and the gate agent tried to casually gloss over us having another guy. I asked him where the other guy was, he got flustered, and said per policy of the tulip, jumpseaters could only fly in economy, which was full, and we had one flight deck jumpseat, and so the other guy was SOL.

At this point I get up, tell the gate agent that I’m walking off the plane, and I’m not getting back on until the other commuter was coming onboard with me. And then I get off the airplane. My captain was too stunned to speak (but he was glad I did what I did). I let our new commuter friend up top know we weren’t leaving without him, and a few minutes later, he’s printed a boarding pass and on our merry way we went.


Fast forward to today…I was the recipient of such kindness. Thanks to some traffic, I got to the airport 25 minutes before my first flight option was going to leave. I arrived at the gate at D-14 only to see the flight closed. I asked the gAAte agent to list me for the flight, she said I’m SOL and that the flight’s closed. I told her we’re D-12 at this point, and she said she can’t put me on the flight and I’m out of luck. I’m about to give up and try a later flight…when the captain walks up, and I ask him if I could hitch a ride. He asks if I’m in CASS since I’d need to sit in the flight deck, I say I am, and he tells the gate agent to put me on the flight. After some back and forth…with him telling her there’s plenty of time to list me after she’s trying to make excuses to not let me on…she begrudgingly lists me, while being super pissed off for having to do it. And then she hands me my boarding pass while I had a very happy grin on my face for making my commute. The best part…the flight dropped the brake at exactly D-0, meaning we didn’t get out late.


Just a reminder. Most gate agents are cool and sympathize with nonrevs and commuting crew. And usually they will help us out. They deserve to be bribed with coffee and donuts from time to time if they’re really cool. But sometimes, some bad eggs will act like they own the jumpseat. They do not. The captain does. Sometimes they’re too scared to take a delay and will screw us over. Making the walk will prevent that from happening. ",24,1738368642.0,flying,7,1.0,False

Take that closet and put a disco ball in it! It'll serve no purpose, but it'll look sweet on insta! Remote control led lights taped to the bottom of a lofted Ikea bed should do it! Screw fire codes, sound proofing is for suckers! Cover that hollow door in paper, that'll keep guests safe in the event of a fire! Our guests will enjoy the intamacy that comes from hearing their neighbors defecating in the morning, its like they're right in the room with them. Speaking of defecating, wheres no windows? Anywhere? (I'd make a suggestion as to where they got their linens, but alas, the fold out love seat they had waiting for me had no linens, or proper pillow for that matter). Anywho, when these bros realize that they're in way over their heads, they turn the ""hotel"" into a cash grab. It doesn't matter that the guests are beyond upset, they aren't worried about return guests. Get their money, get 'em in, and tell them they can leave if they don't like it. The location is decent, with exception to the techno club right next door if you like techno at 1 in the morning, you're in luck, there is no soundproofing. You’ll be treated to an uninterrupted soundtrack of pounding bass while you try to fall asleep.  But even if you start to let the rhythmic pulses lull you to sleep, the front desk phone rings at such an ear-splitting volume, it actually cuts through the club’s noise. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? 3am the phone rings, no one’s there to answer it and the whole second floor gets woken up. My freshman dorm room was bigger, quieter, and—this is key—had hot water. Also, my dorm room had at least a desk to put my pocket change or beverage down on. And again, we had hot water. Speaking of no sleep, that coffee bar they tout features a Keurig stocked with McCafe K-Cups (proudly representing Puerto Rican culture that they tout so boldly on their website, right?). Oh, and the mini fridge next to it? Not plugged in. Only get one snack, you heathens! I took two just to be spiteful. That disco room they show a picture of is just a weird closet that just looks like a place frat boys would drag... never mind. The whole place feels like a frat house. My fellow travelers were great; we bonded together over the ridiculousness of or accommodations. I spoke to a lot of the guests at the Somos Hotel, I didn't speak to one happy guest. There were so many angry guests in the lobby our last day that the police were called, that spilled out into the street. One room had been robbed. Another man was woken in the middle of the night by water dripping from the ceiling onto his face (yes, it turned out to be toilet water), another family had someone a code to enter the room in the middle of the night.      I don’t know these guys, I have no idea if they’re frat boys, or finance bros, or the visionaries they claim to be. I have no idea nor do I care to know anything about the financing of their ventures. I’m just saying that’s what it seems like. It’s in the fact that the whole thing feels like a cash grab in a designer shirt. These bros aren’t here for happy guests or repeat business. The grift is simple- Get the money, bait and switch, pack them in, and tell the guests to leave if they don’t like it. Because just leaving and just getting another hotel room without advance reservation is financially feasible for most folks; you’re effectively trapped like it or not. The bros who run this place just aren't smart enough to run a hotel- inept is the perfect word. Clearly they're in over their head and have no regard for their customers, they're just trying to juice as much as they can while they can. ",4,1738368112.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

1 And it came to pass that Jared, a certain man of Zarahemla, did labor diligently in the records of the Church, even until he didst come upon many curious works, which were not spoken of in Sunday school.

2 And behold, he didst say unto himself, “Surely these things cannot be true, for my seminary teacher spake not of them, neither did my elders quorum instructor.”

3 But lo, Jared’s curiosity did wax strong, and he did venture forth unto the Internet, where many things were written, both good and evil.

4 And it came to pass that he didst read of many great and marvelous things, even of horses and steel in the land of Bountiful, which did not exist in that day.

5 And he didst say, “Behold, this is exceedingly strange, for I have seen no Nephite chariot upon the highways of Salt Lake.”

6 And he didst read further concerning the translation of the plates, and lo, he was astonished, for he had supposed that Joseph did look upon the plates whilst translating.

7 But behold, it was not so, for he did place his face in a hat, and Jared did exclaim, “Surely this is the manner in which my uncle seeketh revelation at family reunions.”

8 And he didst continue in his reading, even unto the wives of Joseph, which were as numerous as the sands of the seashore.

9 And Jared did marvel and say, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, my elders quorum leader spake not of these things when he taught of eternal families.”

10 And it came to pass that Jared did take these things unto his brethren, even unto his bishop, and he did inquire, saying, “Behold, what meaneth these things?”

11 But his bishop waxed wroth and did say, “Thou must not look beyond the mark, for great is the mystery of faith.”

12 And Jared did say, “Yea, great indeed is the mystery, for I know not what is true, and my wife hath already joined a Facebook group.”

13 And it came to pass that Jared did dwell much in thought, and lo, he did partake of coffee, and it was exceedingly good, yea, even beyond all the descriptions of the Word of Wisdom.

14 And Jared did go forth from that place, and he did rejoice, for he was free, and he did not look back, save it were to laugh a little.

	3.	Once the decoction is ready, I add it directly to the boiling milk (not the other way around) so the flavors can meld properly.
	4.	I let it simmer for about 2 minutes to deepen the taste.
	5.	Finally, I froth it by pouring it back and forth between the tumbler and davara before serving.

I ordered 2 packs on Ethiopian varietals that he had and he also sent me a gift of nearly 100g of a competition graded bean from a producer he works, which is great!

But here comes the problem, I first opened the gifted beans he sent me, but they smelled and tasted burnt, I tried lowering the temp, grinding coarser, etc but nothing really worked. While talking with the roaster, he mentioned that I might be tasting “roast notes” that may vanish once the coffee is properly rested, which he said might be 3-5 days from roast date (I got the bag literally hours after roasted), but even after 5 days the coffee still tasted burnt.

Now I’ve opened one of the Ethiopian bags (beans from the attached pic) and it also had this burnt taste, and now the guy is saying that the coffee might need 10-15 days resting to truly open up.

Does this all make sense to you? I thought untested coffee was supposed to taste grassy, not burnt. Also, does this pic look like a roast level that might need over 10 days of resting to you?

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

I counted over half dozen different kiosks and all but one were selling cell phone covers. The other one was celling stockings and sunglasses and a few other items. All of the people selling cell phone covers also seemed like they were South Asian. One was for sure because I asked him (nice guy from Pakistan who said this was his second year here in Canada) as I was browsing the items. I asked if he was making money and he laughed saying not bad.

Isn't it expensive to rent kiosks in places like Metrotown mall? I know next to nothing about business so maybe it's cheap I don't know. I figured can't be cheaper than 4-5k/month, but who knows, maybe they got other kinds of deals with the mall so it's fear and anything they sell it's half and half profit, I don't know.

I mean I am sure it can't be cheap for the huge stores either, and there are many of them that seemed to be nearly empty. What do they pay the mall, 10, 20, or 30k/month? And we had gone there at a time where the mall was quite packed, like big lineups for fast food places and coffee shops and all that. So they must be making a killing on the few items that they do sell, to just break even.

Can do someone the math for me? What is it these people doing right to be making money given what seems like a huge investment",10,1738367014.0,askvan,5,1.0,False

After spending countless hours switching between spreadsheets and notes to track my home roasting hobby (and seeing others do the same), so I gathered a few friends and we built PuckPrep - a simple platform to help manage roasting operations, whether you're roasting on your Behmor in the garage or running a small roastery.

Some features we've got so far:

* Track your green bean inventory
* Log and analyze your roasts
* Record cupping sessions
* Share your roasts with the public

We've just launched the open beta and would love to get feedback from this awesome community. There's a free tier if you want to try it out and see if it fits your workflow.

This is very much a work in progress as we're actively building and improving based on user feedback. What features would you find most useful in a coffee roasting platform?

Check it out at [puckprep.io](https://puckprep.io) if you're interested!

I have a background in coffee and am very passionate about food and cooking in general. Always been interested in learning more about chocolate since they are similar but I'm not crazy about sugary foods. Eventually I found myself enjoying snacking on 100% ghirardelli dark chocolate wafers. I decided I wanted to try some other types pure cacao. After trying a few, I was fascinated and realized there's no better time to go for a deep dive into the rabbit hole. Sure you could try a new chocolate each week, but the differences and nuances are less obvious when spread apart. After all, most chocolate will taste primarily like... cholate. I wanted to really see the full spectrum of what chocolate has to offer, and doing a ton in a dense period seemed the most efficient. Plus maybe a touch of 'tism involved.

**Methods**  
This all took place over the course of maybe 2 months where I would typically start each day mindfully trying around \~5g from 3 new bars at a time, selected randomly with an RNG. More than 3 new ones at a time tended to be a little too confusing on the palate, but I would often go back and make retroactive comparisions as sanity checks after the new ones. Then when I was all done, I went back and did a lot more fine tuning of my results. Some days I tried 20+ chocolates in the same day. I logged all of this on an excel spreadsheet. I'm not gonna share it here, but I tracked the following: `Brand, Origin, Variety, Exp date, Price, Weight, $ per g.` And then I had numerical ranking systems for the following categories: `Package (the unboxing experience), Visual (of chocolate bar), mouthfeel, potency, distinctness, sweetness, bitterness, acidity, and overall score`. I noted if there were any flavor notes on the package and recorded my own comments as well. I'm not a professional chocolate taster but to me, these categories were the most relevant things to track. I also took photos of the packaging and bars.

**Source**  
All chocolates were sourced online. Most were from [barandcocoa.com](http://barandcocoa.com) . I'm not writing this to shill them, but they were clearly the store with the largest collection of specialty 100% dark chocolates and prices were comparable or better to purchasing directly from the brands themselves. Their customer service was very good too, I'm quite happy with them. Ultimately I ended up buying all the possible 100% bars they had offered on the website at the time. Then there were a handful of brand-specific purchases where I bought through the brand website like To'ak.

# Observations

There's a lot of things I could say.... I'm gonna subcategorize by the things I tracked.

**Brand**

* Most brands do not offer a wide array of 100% cacao options. Usually just was only one. Some exceptions were *A. Morin*,  *Chocolat Madagascar*, and *Fresco*. These brands had 3+ types. *To'ak* and *Ora* also have some sampler packs that include 3 unsweetened cacao types. I didn't feel a strong correlation with whether or not a chocolate won any of the major awards (AoC or Int. Choc Awards) and how much I enjoyed them.

**Origin**

* Most bars were single orgin, usually from Latin America. Also a decent chunk from Africa. Least common was south pacific / oceania. There were some minor patterns in origin country and taste, but in general less than I expected. One notable origin was Nicaragua which the different brands I tried all seemed to share a very interesting and distinct flavor that I compare to leathery/woody and really enjoyed a lot, especially in *Momotombo* and *Friis Holm La Dalia.* The Ghanas that I tried from different brands both seemed to have an unmistakeable graham cracker type flavor. The fruitiest ones tended to come from Peru. Similar to coffee, I think the processing (fermentation, roasting, refining, conching) steps tend to play a larger factor in taste than the origin. And more processed ones (ie roasted darker, refined more) definitely seem to take away any exotic origin flavors in return for being more roasty taste, or in the case of conching, more rounded and smooth overall.

**Variety**

* As for variety, majority did not have the variety immediately listed on the packaging. The main cacao varieties are Nacional, Criollo, Trinitario, and Forestero. Not enough data to make any reasonable observations, although in general it is said that nacional/criollo are the finer cacao, and forestero is the large commercialized hardy lower quality cacao. Indeed I wasn't too big a fan of one Forastero, although another one I did like quite a lot and it was one of my favorites overall.

**Exp Date**

* Ranged from early 2025 to late 2027. I didnt notice any differences based on how ""fresh"" they were, although one that was close to expiration had what I would consider a defect taste.

**Price/Weight**

* Bars ranged from 50-100g each, and the price per gram ranged from 11c per gram to 31 cents per gram. *To'ak*, a brand that clearly tries to capture the ""luxury"" market was the most expensive overall, an outlier at a whopping $1.07 per gram. The highest priced single bar besides To'ak was *Soma Arcana* at $19.50 for a 65g bar. I gotta say Arcana was one of my favorites overall, that being said I wouldn't say there was a correlation at all between price per gram and how much I enjoyed them. In fact, *A. Morin* had several of my favorites overall, and they were very cheap.

**Packaging**

* I quickly realized that the packaging makes a big impact on setting the stage for a chocolate experience. A beautifully embossed carboard box with aesthetic design, open it to reveal a satisfying crisp shiny wrapper sealing the precious cacao... Sure it doesnt affect flavor but its nice to have. Some that stood out with fantastic packaging / unwrapping experience were (no order): *Baiani, Zotter Labooko, Fruition, Chocolarder, Rozsavolgyi Naked Cocoa,* and *Mission Chocolate.* I also factored in functionality/informatics when evaluating the packaging. *Fresco*, although ugly design and dumb brand name imo, is has cool information regarding the processing aspects of chocolate.

**Visual**

* Similarly, the chocolate bar itself. My top tier in terms of artistic design of the chocolate bar were: *Baiani, Zotter Labooko, Chocolarder, Rozsavolgyi Naked Cocoa*, and *Letterpress*. But there were a lot of other cool ones too. *Varlhona, Auro Saloy, Cacaoteca, Definite, Fjak, Mirzam, Ritual, Soma*, are all worth mentioning for their chocolate design.

**Mouthfeel**

* I definitely found myself preferring the chocolates that were more silky smooth and luscious as opposed to chalky. However, I did notice a correlation that seemed to be, the smoother the chocolate was, the more round generic taste it would have. It seems that this is because the refining/conching process of chocolate, which makes it more smooth, also tends to vaporize some of the more exotic volatile taste/aroma compounds and acids. So on one hand, yes, the smooth ones tended to be very satisfying texturally and with a round, pleasant flavor without being too acidic or bitter, they also tended to lack the more interesting and distinct exotic flavors that a less processed chocolate would. Some of the most hyper smooth were *The Organic House* and *Francois Pralus*, both which were favorites overall for me. *Maison Bonnat Noir* also was hyper smooth, but also had a very distinct oily flavor reminiscent of fish oil, which was unforgivable. I'll talk more about potential defects in another subcategory. *Chocolat Madagascar* brand as a whole had some very nice mouthfeel, too. Some that I did not like their mouthfeel: *Valrhona Araguani, Amedei Toscano Black, Akessons, Dandelion Camino Verde, Chocolarder, Marana.* These tended to be more chalky or gritty or coarse and did not melt well in the mouth. Some like *Raaka* and *Cacaoteca* intentionally had bits of cacao nibs, I wasn't a fan of *Raaka* texture but in *Cacaoteca* they executed it very well imo.

**Potency**

* In this category I attempted to measure the ""strength"" of the flavor that it did have (not necesarily the character of flavor). A low potency flavor would be more of a ""watered down"" type of flavor, which in general I did not prefer, like in *Amadei* *Toscano*. But some executions of it were pleasant: *Mirzam Tanzania* has a lovely mild, airy, slightly weet with a subtle woodiness and perhaps vanilla taste. *Soma Arcana* was also on the more mild side, albeit fantastic. On the other side of the spectrum, *A. Morin* is a good example of high potency flavors, and part of the reason I liked them a lot.

**Distinctness**

* This refers to whether or not the flavor is ""typical"" chocolate or has some notably distinct, different flavors going on. Some high distinct ones were *Baiani*, which, although lower potency and suboptimal mouthfeel, has a very interesting and unique herbal taste that almost comes off as spearmint to me. *A. Morin Guemon* is another good example due to its intense smokey/woody flavor. Distinct isnt necesarily good or bad, chocolates with defects, or out of the ordinary smoothness or extreme sweetness which I also rated as highy distinct.

**Sweetness**

* Pretty self explanatory and easy to measure, most had no or minimal sweetness. What amazed me was how sweet a few of them were, to the extent where I even emailed the supplier asking if they might have made a mistake (for *Cacao Hunters*). It literally tastes like an \~80% dark chocolate bar to me, they assured me no sugar added, and I noticed some others were quite sweet too (*Fresco 267, A. Morin Chanchamayo*). So I did a lot of research into this. yes there are small amounts of naturally occuring sugars occuring in cacao which can come out more due to caramelization during roasting, but probably not enough alone to explain this phenomena. Other factors are sugars in the coffee pulp (longer fermentation potentially ""absorbing"" more of these) and naturally occuring amino acids/polyphenols/flavonoids which can increase perception of sweetness. The fermentation explanation makes the most sense to me, maybe some pulp residue even left on the beans after fermentation. It would be interesting to send some of these to a lab to analyze exactly how much sugar is in them.

**Bitterness**

* Not quite as easy to discern because potency, sweetness, acidity all seem to play a factor in the perception of bitterness. Hypersmooth ones tended to be less bitter, like *Francois Pralus* and *The Organic House* and *Fresco 267*. But not always- *Zotter Labooko Maya* was a good example of a nice mouthfeel dark, bold bitter one, which I liked a lot. *Varlhona Araguani* had very classic, bitter dark choclate forward but to me unidimensional and uninspiring with a chalky texture. 

**Acidity**

* This also was a little more tricky to evaluate compared to some of the others. I notice one downside of trying a lot of chocolates at once is that, as you keep tasting, sometimes it feels like the taste buds start wearing down and becoming more or less receptive to certain aspects being notable. That said, there was a similar trend where the more refined ones tended to be less acidic and round, whereas less refined more acidic and complex. *Conexion* Ecuador 100% is a great example of a very complex, high acidity one. Also *Original Beans* Cusco, probably the most fruit/berry forward chocolate of all of them, was high acidity. *Goodnow Farms* too, with a ""peachy"" flavor although I thought it was overrated overall and a little astringent. *A. Morin Chanchomayo* also fruity and bright.

**Astringency**

* I didnt track this, but could have. In generally I did not prefer higher levels of astringency. Most did not have much. I really enjoyed *Fresco 267*, and as a result bought their six other 100% bars, but unfortunately the rest generally were high astringency and grassy-ish which I wasnt crazy about.

**Tasting notes**

* I tracked my notes, as well as any notes listed on the bar itself. Like wine and coffee, in general I would say the tasting notes are very hit or miss. I'd say at least 50% of the time they just felt like BS and werent applicable. Especially if they were really detailed, like *The Organic House* describes theirs as *""Porcini, sage, lilac, petit verdot. Mellow earthy notes with a smooth finish.""* What? No. Fantastic bar but thats BS. The more concise descriptions tended to be more accurate. Like *Moka Origins* Tanzania ""100% dark chocolate with subtle notes of cherry."" Thats better, and indeed I felt there was a subtle cherry notes to it. Great bar too.

**Defects**

* Out of the 61, maybe 4 or 5 of them had what I would consider a major defect. The most frequent was a weird but unmistakeable fishy, oily taste. It was very notable in the aftertaste of *Maison Bonnat Noir*, which would have been an outstanding hypersmooth bar without it. *Ora* Uganda also had it, gross. They are one of those ""ceremonial drinking chocolate"" companies and honestly all of them were not great and excessively acidic imo. Much better off just buying these nicer bars as the price isnt really different. Letterpress Esmeraldas also had the unforgiveable fishy oily taste, although this was only present in this bar, their Ashanti Ghana bar was fine and quite good with that classic Ghana graham cracker toasty taste. Another defect I noticed was a petrol type of flavor found in *Millcreek Cacao* ecuador arriba nacional. *Raaka* tasted fine, but smell was subtly offputting like rancid oil and not crazy about its texture.

# OVERALL!!!!

* If you made it this far,cool. Overall, I rated my total enjoyment from 1 to 4. A score of 1 meant it was definitely offputting/bad. A score of 2 meant not bad but prob wouldnt buy again. 3 meant good or interesting in some way to consider purchasing again. 4 were my favorites overall. 
* Of the 61\] 17 scored 4/4. 28 scored 3/4. 12 scored 2/4. and 4 scored 1/4. Which makes sense cause these are all fine, highly regarded chocolatiers and mostly should be enjoyable.
* **Here are the 4/4s and what I liked about them, in no order:**

>*The Organic House,* Phillippines: hypersmooth, not very acidic/bitter, mellow soft caramel, milky and creamy, nutty. Disagree with the floral tasting notes, but it is a mellower taste so I can see why.

>*Cacao Hunters*, Colombia: Very tasty, extremely sweet, caramely, mellow flavors, maybe a little fruity. their description isnt bad \[""flavors of lemongrass, lemon balm, green apple, fresh herbs, and flowers""\], I think apple works. Well balanced although suspiciously sweet, probably the sweetest overall.

>*Momotombo Waslala*, Nicaragua: Soft/mellow yet profound. A very distinct leathery/woody flavor with a touch of mintiness. Interesting degree of complexity for being mellow, and highly distinct

>*Domori*, Venezuela: Potent hazelnut flavor, almost like nutella. Maybe peanut/almond a tad. Very smooth mouthfeel, rich and balanced.

>*Original Beans*, Cusco: The most fruity, ridiculous berry flavor, deep and bright.

>*Francois Pralus,* Madagascar: Hypersmooth and lush, intensely milky, toasted nut/caramel. really well executed crowd-pleaser for sure. good job sir

>*Zotter Labooka Maya*, blend: Great mouthfeel with beautiful packaging and design. Bold and intense. A fearless, classic dark chocolate flavor leaning towards bitter.

>*Firetree*, Vanuatu: Deep, rich, moody, balanced. There is a slight hint of red fruit flavor in the periphery. satisfying lip smacking texture.

>*Fresco 267*, Ghana: Very sweet, nutty, toasty. Very smooth and rounded, albeit a tinge of astringency in the finish. Light on the palate with a very distinct graham cracker flavor.

>*A. Morin Guemon,* Ivory Coast: Unmistakeable smokey/woody flavor. Potent, entrancing and distinct. love it.

>*A. Morin Chanchamayo,* Peru: Extremely fruity, floral, complex. Very sweet and hard to believe its not sweetened or flavored.

>*Friis Holm La Dalia*, Nicaragua: satisfying mouthfeel, soft and mellow yet profound. shares similar leathery/woody (tobacco?) flavor as the other Nicaraguans, great.

>*Definite Chocolate*, Dominican Republic: A soft herbal flavor, almost minty, balanced with some bitterness. I wouldnt call it particularly fruity \[like the notes\], but black tea taste for sure is applicable. interesting!

>*Moka Origins,* Tanzania: sweet, I agree it has a cherry like fruitiness. straightforward and enjoyable.

>*Mission Chocolate,* Brazil: deep, luscious, vivid. Musky undertone, like mushroom, with a molasses flavor.

>*A. Morin Porcelana*, Venezuela: Fruity, roasty, nutty, floral, woody... All perfectly balanced, another banger by A Morin.

>*Soma Arcana*, blend: Airy and light flavor, but not in a watered down way. No bitterness. Like sweet cream or toasted marshmallow. Theres a strong ""browned butter"" element, but I dont notice any fruitiness \[like in the tasting notes\]

Honestly its hard to pick favorites even, I feel like I want to mention a few of the 3/4s that maybe could be 4s: *Rozsavolgyi Naked Cocoa*, Peru was a very great execution of a creamy, rounded, milky straightforward chocolate experience, like drinking a cup of hot chocolate. beautiful packing and design. The *Mirzam*, Tanzania was really nice for a mild, airy, slightly sweed and non domineering flavor, possibly verging on vanilla. ALL of the *Chocolat Madagascar* were really great, beautiful mouthfeel, leaning more towards classic chocolate as opposed to anything exotic or distinct. I will say I was disappointed by *Amadei Toscano Black,* Blend, and *Varlhona Araguani*, Venezuela, which I thought were highly regarded in the chocolate world. And although *Goodnow Farms*, Peru, had a interesting distinct flavor, I dont think it was as good as all the awards that it seems to have won. How about the extremely expensive To'ak ones? They were really good tbh, with pretty accurate notes, but I cant justify the cost. Seems mostly to be marketing. As mentioned earlier, I did not like Ora that much at all. *Baiani*, Brazil was interesting for its distinctness (spearmint?) albeit chalky and watered down flavor.

If I had to pick 5 absolute favorites overall to recommend, that show a good variety of the cacao spectrum, shewww.... Maybe Pralus, Momotombo, A Morin Guemon, Original Beans and Soma Arcana. IDK, maybe throw in one of the extremely sweet ones too if you like that.  
  
**Conclusion**

*  Mainly just wanted to record all of these observations while still fresh in my mind before I close this chapter for now. Since I put in a lot of effort. Figured other people might find it interesting. It was really  fun but a little exhausting since I got a little OCD about it. I'm thinking of taking a chocolate tasting course in the future to learn more. BTW chocolate definitely has caffeine in it, especially in its pure form. Its noticeable when I eat too much or too late in the day, would be hard to sleep at night. 
* Overall it costed over $700 I think and close to 10 lbs of chocolate... I gave some gifts of 56 set samplers relatives for Christmas. Interesting how some of them had completely different observations than my own haha. I'll be finishing the rest of it over the next few months.

Not enough data to make any reasonable observations, although in general it is said that nacional/criollo are the finer cacao, and forestero is the large commercialized hardy lower quality cacao. Indeed I wasn't too big a fan of one Forastero, although another one I did like quite a lot and it was one of my favorites overall.

**Exp Date**

* Ranged from early 2025 to late 2027. I didnt notice any differences based on how ""fresh"" they were, although one that was close to expiration had what I would consider a defect taste.

**Price/Weight**

* Bars ranged from 50-100g each, and the price per gram ranged from 11c per gram to 31 cents per gram. *To'ak*, a brand that clearly tries to capture the ""luxury"" market was the most expensive overall, an outlier at a whopping $1.07 per gram. The highest priced single bar besides To'ak was *Soma Arcana* at $19.50 for a 65g bar. I gotta say Arcana was one of my favorites overall, that being said I wouldn't say there was a correlation at all between price per gram and how much I enjoyed them. In fact, *A. Morin* had several of my favorites overall, and they were very cheap.

**Packaging**

* I quickly realized that the packaging makes a big impact on setting the stage for a chocolate experience. A beautifully embossed carboard box with aesthetic design, open it to reveal a satisfying crisp shiny wrapper sealing the precious cacao... Sure it doesnt affect flavor but its nice to have. Some that stood out with fantastic packaging / unwrapping experience were (no order): *Baiani, Zotter Labooko, Fruition, Chocolarder, Rozsavolgyi Naked Cocoa,* and *Mission Chocolate.* I also factored in functionality/informatics when evaluating the packaging. *Fresco*, although ugly design and dumb brand name imo, is has cool information regarding the processing aspects of chocolate.

**Visual**

* Similarly, the chocolate bar itself. My top tier in terms of artistic design of the chocolate bar were: *Baiani, Zotter Labooko, Chocolarder, Rozsavolgyi Naked Cocoa*, and *Letterpress*. But there were a lot of other cool ones too. *Varlhona, Auro Saloy, Cacaoteca, Definite, Fjak, Mirzam, Ritual, Soma*, are all worth mentioning for their chocolate design.

**Mouthfeel**

* I definitely found myself preferring the chocolates that were more silky smooth and luscious as opposed to chalky. However, I did notice a correlation that seemed to be, the smoother the chocolate was, the more round generic taste it would have. It seems that this is because the refining/conching process of chocolate, which makes it more smooth, also tends to vaporize some of the more exotic volatile taste/aroma compounds and acids. So on one hand, yes, the smooth ones tended to be very satisfying texturally and with a round, pleasant flavor without being too acidic or bitter, they also tended to lack the more interesting and distinct exotic flavors that a less processed chocolate would. Some of the most hyper smooth were *The Organic House* and *Francois Pralus*, both which were favorites overall for me. *Maison Bonnat Noir* also was hyper smooth, but also had a very distinct oily flavor reminiscent of fish oil, which was unforgivable. I'll talk more about potential defects in another subcategory. *Chocolat Madagascar* brand as a whole had some very nice mouthfeel, too. Some that I did not like their mouthfeel: *Valrhona Araguani, Amedei Toscano Black, Akessons, Dandelion Camino Verde, Chocolarder, Marana.* These tended to be more chalky or gritty or coarse and did not melt well in the mouth. Some like *Raaka* and *Cacaoteca* intentionally had bits of cacao nibs, I wasn't a fan of *Raaka* texture but in *Cacaoteca* they executed it very well imo.

**Potency**

* In this category I attempted to measure the ""strength"" of the flavor that it did have (not necesarily the character of flavor). A low potency flavor would be more of a ""watered down"" type of flavor, which in general I did not prefer, like in *Amadei* *Toscano*. But some executions of it were pleasant: *Mirzam Tanzania* has a lovely mild, airy, slightly weet with a subtle woodiness and perhaps vanilla taste. *Soma Arcana* was also on the more mild side, albeit fantastic. On the other side of the spectrum, *A. Morin* is a good example of high potency flavors, and part of the reason I liked them a lot.

**Distinctness**

* This refers to whether or not the flavor is ""typical"" chocolate or has some notably distinct, different flavors going on. Some high distinct ones were *Baiani*, which, although lower potency and suboptimal mouthfeel, has a very interesting and unique herbal taste that almost comes off as spearmint to me. *A. Morin Guemon* is another good example due to its intense smokey/woody flavor. Distinct isnt necesarily good or bad, chocolates with defects, or out of the ordinary smoothness or extreme sweetness which I also rated as highy distinct.

**Sweetness**

* Pretty self explanatory and easy to measure, most had no or minimal sweetness. What amazed me was how sweet a few of them were, to the extent where I even emailed the supplier asking if they might have made a mistake (for *Cacao Hunters*). It literally tastes like an \~80% dark chocolate bar to me, they assured me no sugar added, and I noticed some others were quite sweet too (*Fresco 267, A. Morin Chanchamayo*). So I did a lot of research into this. yes there are small amounts of naturally occuring sugars occuring in cacao which can come out more due to caramelization during roasting, but probably not enough alone to explain this phenomena. Other factors are sugars in the coffee pulp (longer fermentation potentially ""absorbing"" more of these) and naturally occuring amino acids/polyphenols/flavonoids which can increase perception of sweetness. The fermentation explanation makes the most sense to me, maybe some pulp residue even left on the beans after fermentation. It would be interesting to send some of these to a lab to analyze exactly how much sugar is in them.

**Bitterness**

* Not quite as easy to discern because potency, sweetness, acidity all seem to play a factor in the perception of bitterness. Hypersmooth ones tended to be less bitter, like *Francois Pralus* and *The Organic House* and *Fresco 267*. But not always- *Zotter Labooko Maya* was a good example of a nice mouthfeel dark, bold bitter one, which I liked a lot. *Varlhona Araguani* had very classic, bitter dark choclate forward but to me unidimensional and uninspiring with a chalky texture. 

**Acidity**

* This also was a little more tricky to evaluate compared to some of the others. I notice one downside of trying a lot of chocolates at once is that, as you keep tasting, sometimes it feels like the taste buds start wearing down and becoming more or less receptive to certain aspects being notable. That said, there was a similar trend where the more refined ones tended to be less acidic and round, whereas less refined more acidic and complex. *Conexion* Ecuador 100% is a great example of a very complex, high acidity one. Also *Original Beans* Cusco, probably the most fruit/berry forward chocolate of all of them, was high acidity. *Goodnow Farms* too, with a ""peachy"" flavor although I thought it was overrated overall and a little astringent. *A. Morin Chanchomayo* also fruity and bright.

**Astringency**

* I didnt track this, but could have. In generally I did not prefer higher levels of astringency. Most did not have much. I really enjoyed *Fresco 267*, and as a result bought their six other 100% bars, but unfortunately the rest generally were high astringency and grassy-ish which I wasnt crazy about.

**Tasting notes**

* I tracked my notes, as well as any notes listed on the bar itself. Like wine and coffee, in general I would say the tasting notes are very hit or miss. I'd say at least 50% of the time they just felt like BS and werent applicable. Especially if they were really detailed, like *The Organic House* describes theirs as *""Porcini, sage, lilac, petit verdot. Mellow earthy notes with a smooth finish.""* What? No. Fantastic bar but thats BS. The more concise descriptions tended to be more accurate. Like *Moka Origins* Tanzania ""100% dark chocolate with subtle notes of cherry."" Thats better, and indeed I felt there was a subtle cherry notes to it. Great bar too.

**Defects**

* Out of the 61, maybe 4 or 5 of them had what I would consider a major defect. The most frequent was a weird but unmistakeable fishy, oily taste. It was very notable in the aftertaste of *Maison Bonnat Noir*, which would have been an outstanding hypersmooth bar without it. *Ora* Uganda also had it, gross. They are one of those ""ceremonial drinking chocolate"" companies and honestly all of them were not great and excessively acidic imo. Much better off just buying these nicer bars as the price isnt really different. Letterpress Esmeraldas also had the unforgiveable fishy oily taste, although this was only present in this bar, their Ashanti Ghana bar was fine and quite good with that classic Ghana graham cracker toasty taste. Another defect I noticed was a petrol type of flavor found in *Millcreek Cacao* ecuador arriba nacional. *Raaka* tasted fine, but smell was subtly offputting like rancid oil and not crazy about its texture.

# OVERALL!!!!

* If you made it this far,cool. Overall, I rated my total enjoyment from 1 to 4. A score of 1 meant it was definitely offputting/bad. A score of 2 meant not bad but prob wouldnt buy again. 3 meant good or interesting in some way to consider purchasing again. 4 were my favorites overall. 
* Of the 61\] 17 scored 4/4. 28 scored 3/4. 12 scored 2/4. and 4 scored 1/4. Which makes sense cause these are all fine, highly regarded chocolatiers and mostly should be enjoyable.
* **Here are the 4/4s and what I liked about them, in no order:**

>*The Organic House,* Phillippines: hypersmooth, not very acidic/bitter, mellow soft caramel, milky and creamy, nutty. Disagree with the floral tasting notes, but it is a mellower taste so I can see why.

>*Cacao Hunters*, Colombia: Very tasty, extremely sweet, caramely, mellow flavors, maybe a little fruity. their description isnt bad \[""flavors of lemongrass, lemon balm, green apple, fresh herbs, and flowers""\], I think apple works. Well balanced although suspiciously sweet, probably the sweetest overall.

>*Momotombo Waslala*, Nicaragua: Soft/mellow yet profound. A very distinct leathery/woody flavor with a touch of mintiness. Interesting degree of complexity for being mellow, and highly distinct

>*Domori*, Venezuela: Potent hazelnut flavor, almost like nutella. Maybe peanut/almond a tad. Very smooth mouthfeel, rich and balanced.

>*Original Beans*, Cusco: The most fruity, ridiculous berry flavor, deep and bright.

>*Francois Pralus,* Madagascar: Hypersmooth and lush, intensely milky, toasted nut/caramel. really well executed crowd-pleaser for sure. good job sir

>*Zotter Labooka Maya*, blend: Great mouthfeel with beautiful packaging and design. Bold and intense. A fearless, classic dark chocolate flavor leaning towards bitter.

>*Firetree*, Vanuatu: Deep, rich, moody, balanced. There is a slight hint of red fruit flavor in the periphery. satisfying lip smacking texture.

>*Fresco 267*, Ghana: Very sweet, nutty, toasty. Very smooth and rounded, albeit a tinge of astringency in the finish. Light on the palate with a very distinct graham cracker flavor.

>*A. Morin Guemon,* Ivory Coast: Unmistakeable smokey/woody flavor. Potent, entrancing and distinct. love it.

>*A. Morin Chanchamayo,* Peru: Extremely fruity, floral, complex. Very sweet and hard to believe its not sweetened or flavored.

>*Friis Holm La Dalia*, Nicaragua: satisfying mouthfeel, soft and mellow yet profound. shares similar leathery/woody (tobacco?) flavor as the other Nicaraguans, great.

>*Definite Chocolate*, Dominican Republic: A soft herbal flavor, almost minty, balanced with some bitterness. I wouldnt call it particularly fruity \[like the notes\], but black tea taste for sure is applicable. interesting!

>*Moka Origins,* Tanzania: sweet, I agree it has a cherry like fruitiness. straightforward and enjoyable.

>*Mission Chocolate,* Brazil: deep, luscious, vivid. Musky undertone, like mushroom, with a molasses flavor.

>*A. Morin Porcelana*, Venezuela: Fruity, roasty, nutty, floral, woody... All perfectly balanced, another banger by A Morin.

>*Soma Arcana*, blend: Airy and light flavor, but not in a watered down way. No bitterness. Like sweet cream or toasted marshmallow. Theres a strong ""browned butter"" element, but I dont notice any fruitiness \[like in the tasting notes\]

Honestly its hard to pick favorites even, I feel like I want to mention a few of the 3/4s that maybe could be 4s: *Rozsavolgyi Naked Cocoa*, Peru was a very great execution of a creamy, rounded, milky straightforward chocolate experience, like drinking a cup of hot chocolate. beautiful packing and design. The *Mirzam*, Tanzania was really nice for a mild, airy, slightly sweed and non domineering flavor, possibly verging on vanilla. ALL of the *Chocolat Madagascar* were really great, beautiful mouthfeel, leaning more towards classic chocolate as opposed to anything exotic or distinct. I will say I was disappointed by *Amadei Toscano Black,* Blend, and *Varlhona Araguani*, Venezuela, which I thought were highly regarded in the chocolate world. And although *Goodnow Farms*, Peru, had a interesting distinct flavor, I dont think it was as good as all the awards that it seems to have won. How about the extremely expensive To'ak ones? They were really good tbh, with pretty accurate notes, but I cant justify the cost. Seems mostly to be marketing. As mentioned earlier, I did not like Ora that much at all. *Baiani*, Brazil was interesting for its distinctness (spearmint?) albeit chalky and watered down flavor.

If I had to pick 5 absolute favorites overall to recommend, that show a good variety of the cacao spectrum, shewww.... Maybe Pralus, Momotombo, A Morin Guemon, Original Beans and Soma Arcana. IDK, maybe throw in one of the extremely sweet ones too if you like that.  
  
**Conclusion**

*  Mainly just wanted to record all of these observations while still fresh in my mind before I close this chapter for now. Since I put in a lot of effort. Figured other people might find it interesting. It was really  fun but a little exhausting since I got a little OCD about it. I'm thinking of taking a chocolate tasting course in the future to learn more. BTW chocolate definitely has caffeine in it, especially in its pure form. Its noticeable when I eat too much or too late in the day, would be hard to sleep at night. 
* Overall it costed over $700 I think and close to 10 lbs of chocolate... I gave some gifts of 56 set samplers relatives for Christmas. Interesting how some of them had completely different observations than my own haha. I'll be finishing the rest of it over the next few months.

But then I had a bit of coffee, and thought about it. And the truth is, that this stuff doesn't matter. When I get in isn't important, as long as I get in, and it only takes one school to see that I am qualified for me to be fine, whether it's a T12, a T20, or something else, I will do that and I will excel. Everyone here is immensely smart, and talented, and you had to be to get this far in the process, and we're all going to do great things. Law school is going to be hard, and every bump in the road is just another part of the journey. It's a tough cycle, but we just have to roll with the punches, because I believe that everything happens for a reason. This is an element of my faith, but setting that aside, I, and you, will get into the school that you were meant to get into, a school that appreciates you and makes you happy.

And if everything falls through, because of the cycle or something else? Then I will try again, I will work hard, and I will prove that they were wrong to not accept me in the first place. They may not trust me now but trust is something that needs to be earned sometimes, and I know that I am smart and capable enough to earn that trust. Life throws you punches, and as a lawyer, you need to figure out how to roll with them, it's part of the occupation.

You are all smart, capable people, and I believe that the people here are going to go on to do great things, whether you get into a T12, a T20, a T50, or so on. You're going to do great, and don't let the unpredictability of this cycle get you down. We will all get the success that we dream of, as long as we don't give up and strive for it.

Creating more poverty as we speak. 

These words have no meaning unless with an opinion, make what you think of it and process your feelings
This time now is to stand up and rise with gods heavenly gifts, creating us a guide for when we ever hit or miss. 
Our voice, our attitude, our soul and guide. 
Just open up your pineal third eye and let the rain forever shine

I can't hold a grudge to save my life. I always try to be nice to people but the second I over-hear something about myself I start to be an ass to them.

Which makes me want to make them not hate me anymore. I hate that I do that but I can't seem to change my ways. I always second guess my self. 

Here's a situation i was in. I was running late to work. It was a bad habit I'm finally breaking. Other employee says it's okay. I said I would buy them something for being understanding. We say our good byes. On their way out they talk to someone. ""Hey blank your still here?"". ""Yea that dumbass just got here"". I didn't get them the coffee because I felt hurt they would say something like that too me. The next day I was late again 2 minutes(normally how late I usually am).

The Mandels are down with the flu so no delicious Shabbos dinner tonight for me. I hope they feel better soon. But Hedia said they are really sick. I promised to pray for all of them.



Today was such an important day. Our principal, Mrs. Weiss, is the third generation girl in her family to have attended a Bais Yaakov school. She calls Sara Schenirer “Mother,” as do everyone else here. She said her most important job was not to explain, but to show me Sarah's spirit. “If you can understand it, you will be the most wonderful wife, mother, and whatever else you set out to do with your life.”



The afternoons at my school are set aside for academic subjects and they are taught in English. The mornings are religious and Jewish studies, taught in Yiddish and Hebrew. During this time I work independently on my online classes. Lightning speed!



For now, let me just share one story. From Day One she asked me to come in 1 hour early so she can tutor me with my Yiddish. It's coming along slowly. She wants me to know that this is exactly what Sara did, sit with students, one by one and in small groups. They talked, prayed, studied, sang, sewed, and danced. That's the essence of her education. It's all about goals, community, philosophy, and heart.



We have a few days off in between semesters. Today, Monday, and Tuesday. But Mrs. Weiss asked me to come in today. Why? You cannot learn a language just from a book. You have to use it. So yesterday (Thursday), she walked me around the neighborhood to one store after another. She introduced me to the store owner and said that I will be picking up things for the school. And I must speak Yiddish.



So this morning I walked in and she had a list ready for me. In Yiddish. I could pretty much decipher it and with Google Translate I figured everything out. The first stop was the Kosher version of Dunkin' Donuts. I ordered a jug of coffee for all of the people working at the school. I walked to the bakery and ordered very delicious pastries for breakfast. People said my Yiddish is good. They were lying but is lying bad if it encourages someone?



Repeat on Monday and Tuesday.



We heard from Robert. He had a week of paperwork and classroom instruction. Real BCT starts on Monday. He is also really working hard at the gym. He said they had fitness trainers for any soldier. They want him to get rid of all of his body fat. What will I have to hold on to when I see him next?

I am the only person I know who has never tested positive for Covid. I always assumed I had it at one point or another but just never caught it with a test at the right time.

But I started to experience brain fog starting on January 17th and began actually feeling sick (coughing/sinus issues) on January 21st. I didn’t test for Covid until Sunday Jan 26th when my coffee tasted like water. It was positive! I was so shocked but relieved I had an explanation as to the past several days.

Today, Jan 31st, is the first day where my sick symptoms are mostly gone (very occasional cough/clearing of throat), and my body has a lot of energy returned, but I still can’t think straight or focus my eyes on anything for a long time. I continue to need to nap often despite my “body” feeling healthy.

Can someone please tell me that I’m going to be OK and that I will get my brain back?? I’m starting to panic. I’m unemployed and haven’t been looking for work or anything because I’m still in this haze.

I just need some positive stories because I’m terrified of being like this forever. 

Thank you 🙏🏻🤧😶‍🌫️.

A couple years ago, I wrote up a DLC idea for New Horizons called “Beneath the Horizon.” You can find it in my post history. I decided to expand upon my idea and create a pitch for an entirely new game. My hope is that someday, somehow, somebody from Nintendo will see this and use my ideas. If your uncle works for Nintendo, pass this along.



This is only going to be a summary and a list of highlights, as the full game pitch far exceeds Reddit's post limit. You can read the full game pitch [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n34rCuqI2MPIZ4q5BUPMjxfn5cA966F5/view?usp=sharing).



Enjoy the read, and let me know your thoughts in the comments!



**Intro to Animal Crossing – New Heights:**



The player rides a tram/incline railway that slowly climbs a mountain. Rover rides with you, and explains your role as a Junior Ranger (Rover is the Head Ranger). You are on your way to a *sleepy mountain village*, the new setting for New Heights. Your role as Junior Ranger is to nurture and revitalize the sleepy mountain village. This is where you get your chance to customize your character and pick your village layout.



Isabelle runs the Rangers HQ in the sleepy mountain village. She hands you your Ranger's Notebook (gone is the Nook Phone!) and explains some of its tabs (app replacement):

* Ranger Badges (achievement system similar to Nook Miles)
* Critterpedia
* Craftables (similar to DIYs)
* Custom Designs
* Map
* Chat Log
* Ranger's ID (similar to Passport)
* Cartography (new, explained later)



She also hands you a camera and a radio. Radio features:

* Radio Friend (similar to Call Resident)
* Send Message (chat)
* Mayday (similar to Rescue Service)
* Radio Villager (similar to the megaphone from New Leaf)
* Radio Rover (ask for advice / goals)





**Prologue:**



Similar to New Horizons, there will be prologue theme that plays throughout the prologue. Time and seasons also pass differently in the initial stages of the game, similar to New Horizons. The official, real-time clock doesn't start until the prologue is complete.



Prologue Progression:

* Set up your tent
* Introduce yourself to the locals of the sleepy mountain village and complete tasks for them to earn tools
* Visit the nearby town to visit Nook's Cranny and speak to Tom Nook
* Complete tasks for Tom Nook to unlock his Real Estate side-business
* Plant the Village Tree
* Take a nap, and wake up that night
* Attend a party around the Village Tree, hosted by Isabelle
* Sleep again – the next day, the prologue is over, and real-time begins



**Map Details:**



The main map is about the size of New Horizons. It has the following features and main areas:



* **West**: A road (more on roads later) that leads to Whistle Pass (reference: Pocket Camp). Whistle Pass is similar to the Campground from New Leaf
* Harvey runs this campsite. He sells unique furniture that can only be found in Whistle Pass. This unique furniture rotates daily, and the items are Pocket Camp's best uniques!
* **North**: A road that leads to Frosty Peak. Frosty Peak is home to Wendell, who can trade art for fish, and you can also play a sledding mini game for winter materials
* If you give him fish that day, Wendell will also let you use his sled to slide back down the mountain, if you'd rather slide down than use the gondola. The slide down is a short mini-game that gives you the chance to collect a few winter-exclusive crafting materials, even when it's not winter time
* **East**: A road that leads to the town. The town has many empty buildings and plots that the player can “invest” in, in order to bring new businesses (more on investing later). Here is the list of businesses that you can bring to the town (more details on each business later)
* Leif's Plant Shop
* Shampoodle
* GracieGrace
* The Roost
* Police Station
* ReTail
* Happy Home Hotel
* Island Tours
* Dr. Shrunk's Shrink
* Able Sisters
* Secret: Redd's Exotic Creatures



* **South**: There is no road to the south. Instead, the southern part of the village is the Great Lake. This is where you can do a good amount of fishing and swimming. There are quite a few new fish to catch here, but you will not be able to catch any Ocean Fish here. More on Ocean Fish later.
* You can also sometimes find trash washed up on the Great Lake's shore. There is a small cave in the middle of the lake that can only be reached by swimming. Sometimes you will find Farley here, who can improve your tools



**Roads:**



There are 3 available roads leading away from the sleepy mountain village (west, north, east). A road is a short, beautiful path that has plenty of resources (dig spots, fruits, bugs, river or pond fish, rocks). As they are not technically part of the village, you don't have authority as a ranger to tamper with them. This means no chopping trees, breaking rocks, or landscaping (terraforming). Sometimes you will find visitors on the roads, and some bugs/fish can only be found on roads



**Visitors:**



Like in previous games, various unique NPCs will randomly visit your village. Here is the list:

* Wisp: He'll get spooked and hide after you talk to him. Find him to unlock Wispy items (regular items that are transparent / wispy / spooky)
* Blanca: Draw a face for her to receive a gift. She can also visit other player's village and bring you gifts from them



* CJ: CJ can be found wandering the village. CJ sells connectable aquarium pieces that you can use to build large aquariums for your village or house. Many of them stack, or connect seamlessly into wide tanks or specially shaped tanks. These tanks are empty when placed, but you can place caught fish inside them.
* Like in New Horizons, you can also bring CJ 5 of a certain fish to receive a statue of that fish



* Flick: Flick can be found wandering the village. Flick sells connectable terrarium pieces that you can use to build large terrariums for your village or house. These work similarly to CJ's connectable aquarium pieces, but instead, you can place caught bugs inside them.
* Like in New Horizons, you can also bring Flick 5 of a certain bug to receive a statue of that bug



NOTE: In this game, the Fishing / Bug catching tourneys are hosted by Chip / Nat respectively



* Joan: Joan can be found wandering the village on Sunday's. She sells turnips like in previous games. Every 5^(th) visit will be Daisy Mae instead, and her turnips are always a bit cheaper



* Farley: Gnome who can improve your tools



* Frillard: Teaches you unique reactions



* Gulliver: Shoot down his UFO for alien/space themed gifts



* Katrina: Get fortunes / charms



* Pascal: Lead him to Tortimer Island for nautical themed gifts



* Saharah: Special wall paper / flooring / rugs



* Serena: A glimmer can sometimes be seen in twinkling in the main village tree. Interact with it, answer her questions, and earn special hand-helds / cape slot items



**Progression:**



The game will progress as the player earns Ranger Medals. Ranger Medals are a bigger deal that Ranger Badges, as they are only gifted when you accomplish something great for the village. To become a Forest Ranger, you need 10 Ranger Medals. Every Ranger Medal you acquire will unlock more features. Ranger Medals are gifted not by Isabelle, but by Phineas the Medal Master.



**Medal #1**: Gifted after opening up the Museum

* Unlocks:
* Two more plots become available for investment in the town
* The vaulting pole becomes available to purchase or craft
* Ranger Projects become available (similar to Public Work Projects)



**Medal #2**: Gifted after creating the sleepy mountain villager campsite

* Unlocks:
* Two more plots become available for investment in the town
* Ranger HQ gets an upgrade, and will be built to look more like Town Hall from the previous games
* The portable ladder becomes available to purchase or craft
* Celeste moves into the top floor of the Museum (constellation designing + Astrology craftables)



**Medal #3**: Gifted after at least 3 new shops have been opened in the town + at least 1 new animal has been invited to the village. Isabelle celebrates the growth of the town, which is deserving of a medal!

* Unlocks:
* Two more plots become available for investment in the town
* Whistle Pass becomes available
* Swimming becomes available
* Inviting villagers visiting town or Whistle Pass becomes available



**Medal #4**: Gifted after at least 6 new shops have been opened + total villager count is at least 6 + at least 2 Ranger Projects have been completed + at least 40 total items have been donated to the museum. A this point, your tree has grown quite a bit, and you will have another party around the tree. All the new villagers and shop owners will be invited.

* Unlocks:
* Two more plots become available for investment in the town
* The UnderVillage becomes available
* Landscaping (terraforming) becomes available



**Medals #5-10**: Gifted in the UnderVillage (more on the UnderVillage later, after Town Details)

\*\*The UnderVillage unlock is considered the “half-way” point of the game



**Town Details:**



The town is a vital part of the sleepy mountain village's growth. At the start, only Nook's Cranny is open. Once the prologue is complete, you gain the ability to invest in new businesses. To do this, approach one of the 10 empty plots and interact with the sign.



When you “invest” in a business, you're putting your hard earned bells into these plots. It's only fair that you get something in return. Every week, all businesses you've invested in will pool together your share and send it to you in the mail. The amount per business varies, and is never a substantial amount – but over time, you will make back all your bells, and then it's pure profit from there.



**The Businesses:**



Nook's Cranny

* Classic Nook's Cranny, but with several expansions
* Expansion 1: NookMart – They now sell 3 tools, 4 furniture items, 1 wallpaper, 1 flooring, 1 rug, and medicine.
* Expansion 2: T&T Bazaar – They now sell 4 tools, 5 furniture items, 2 wallpapers, 2 floorings, medicine, and 2 fortune cookies (these are similar to New Leaf – they have items from other Nintendo games inside them). The catalog is also present in the Bazaar, allowing you to order previously owned items. Also, Tom Nook now has his own office for Real Estate related purposes
* Expansion 3: Nook's Emporium – They now sell 4 tools, 6 furniture items, 3 wallpapers, 3 floorings, medicine, and 3 fortune cookies. They also restock twice per day, rather than once per day. Also, Tom Nook now offers extravagant exterior additions to your home (lots of customization options) – his office now has its own floor (second story)
* Expansion 4: Nook's Shopping Mall – The largest Nook shopping experience yet. There are 5 floors:
* 1^(st) floor: Furniture. 10 furniture items that restock twice per day. Timmy runs this floor. There is also an 11^(th) “featured” furniture item on display, which is more rare/valuable, which only restocks once per week
* 2^(nd) floor: Miscellaneous. All tools are for sale here, along with medicine, 5 fortune cookies, and various seasonal items. Tommy runs this floor
* 3^(rd) floor: Flooring and wallpaper. There are 5 wallpapers, 5 floorings, and 5 rugs that rotate twice per day. A new NPC runs this floor: Kalaahari, who is Saharah's sister
* 4^(th) floor: Backyard. In New Heights, you can now make special back yards for your homes. This includes special fencing with gates, special terrains, special landforms, and special items (lights, swimming pools you can swim in, swings you can swing in, etc.) The 4^(th) floor is ran by Lyle
* 5^(th) / top floor: Real-estate. This is Tom Nook's floor, where he offers a wide variety of customization for you house(s). New Heights has many more customization items than previous titles: lights, roofs, walls, trimming, chimneys, mailboxes, doors, flags, statues, grand entrances, etc.



Leif's Plant Shop

* Leif owns his own plant shop! He offers a variety of items and services. He sells flowers, bushes, trees, farmables (carrots, wheat, etc), and a new type of item: hedges. These hedges have many varieties and can connect seamlessly. They can be used as simple décor, as fences, or to create elaborate hedge mazes. As for services, you can pay Lief to pluck all your weeds, water all your flowers, and even pluck all your flowers.



Shampoodle:

* Shampoodle's shop is back! Shampoodle can give you unique hair styles, color your hair, and even customize facial hair. Rare hair styles can be found as “Craftables,” which when given to Shampoodle, unlocks the rare hair style.



GracieGrace:

* Gracie returns with her vast collection of luxurious furniture sets. The items are very expensive, many times costing over 100k bells each. To allow the player time to save for her goods, the shop only restocks once per week. Also, once per week you have a chance to impress her with your outfits. If she's impressed, she will give you a voucher, which is good for 1 item in her store. Spend it right away, or save your vouchers to redeem a complete furniture set all at once!



The Roost:

* The Roost is part of the museum no longer – it now is a standalone coffee shop once again. You can sit and have coffee, talk with town visitors, or visit on Friday nights for an acoustic KK Slider show. If you need some extra bells, Brewster is willing to hire you part time as a barista. This mini game is similar to New Leaf's. Besides bells, you can also earn special Brewster / coffee themed items



Police Station:

* Booker and Copper run the police station. Similar to New Leaf, they have a lost-and-found, which can have items ranging from garbage to valuable. If you speak with them, they have plenty of stories to tell about their experience as police dogs. Once per week, they will tell you that a suspicious item has been spotted in the village. If you return this item to them, they will gift you a police-related item in return.



ReTail:

* Cyrus and Reese have opened a shop in the town. Similar to New Leaf, you can put up your own items for sale here. Other visiting players can purchase these items, and villagers can also purchase them. Similarly, other visiting players can bring items to your town and put up their own items for sale. Your villagers will also put up items for sale.
* If you speak to Cyrus, he offers special customization for certain items. This works similarly to New Horizons, allowing recolors of non-craftable items



Happy Home Hotel:

* Lottie has decided to open up a hotel in town, to both attract tourists and give local villagers a place to relax. When the hotel initially opens, there are only 2 rooms, and they are quite drab. Lottie is unsure why nobody is visiting the hotel. Once you mention the rooms are too basic, she asks for help with redesigning them. She will compensate you with bells for each redesigned room
* Each room will require a specific theme (space, beach, winter, sakura, etc). The theme Lottie chooses is random, but by the time all rooms are decorated, every theme will be chosen exactly once
* Every time you finish decorating all available rooms, the next day, 2 more rooms will be available to decorate. Rooms max out at 30You can still re-decorate a room after reaching 30. However, you must still stick to the given theme
* Wardell will join the Hotel staff after completing a certain amount of rooms (15). Like in New Horizons, you can speak with Wardell to pull up a catalog of orderables from themes you have completed\*\*Niko runs the front desk. Speak with him to get updates on tourist activity and hotel growth



Island Tours:

* Dodo Airlines (DAL) found a unique business to open up in a sleepy mountain village: plane rides to Tortimer Island. Sometimes villagers need to escape their hometown for luxury and relaxation. Speak to Orville to get a plain ride from Wilbur to Tortimer Island.
* Tortimer Island is larger than in New Leaf, with more features. But at its core, it's an always-Summer island where you can catch bugs, **catch ocean fish**, harvest coconuts, and swim
* You can find Tortimer, Grams, Leila, and Leilani on Tortimer island. Grams runs the souvenir shop, Leilani runs the reception, and Leila can be found playing on the beach.
* Grams sells special island-themed items in exchange for IsleGems, the reward for winning mini-games
* Leila will sell you special sea-shells for insanely large amounts of bells
* Leilani will send you out to play mini-games, which are ran by Tortimer. These games are similar to New Leaf's games, with a few additions
* You can also find Pelly (day) and Phyllis (night) on Tortimer island in the main building. They allow you to send out one of your items in a bottle into the great, wide ocean. These items will wash up on other player's Tortimer Island. Likewise, you will find bottles from other players on your own island
* Once per week, you can find a viking ship floating somewhere in the waters surrounding Tortimer Island. If you swim out to it, you can climb aboard. Characters on the viking ship:
* Giovanni – Originally from OK Motors, he now sails the seas as a viking. He is dresses and talks like a viking, and the others on the ship call him “Jarl Giovanni.”
* Carlo – Travels with Giovanni. Also dresses and talks like a viking. He sells special viking themed items
* Beppe – Travels with Giovanni. Also dresses and talks like a viking.
* Gullivarr – Is found on the viking ship...but dresses and talks like a pirate. Is he lost? He is indeed lost, and asks you to help him find his compass, which can be found by swimming around and diving for it. If you bring it to him, he'll send you some pirate-themed treasure in the mail the following day.
* Kappn – He is the captain of the ship, who also dresses and talks like a viking. If you speak with him, he'll offer to take you to their next destination. He, of course, sings along the way. The destination island can be one of many themed islands, but each one will always have some foreign island fruit (lychee, banana, etc.) These islands are usually resource heavy, and can have multiple bottles washed up from other players



Dr. Shrunk's Shrink:

* There is a new shrink in town, and he'd definitely qualified. Dr. Shrunk's office is small and has 2 doctors
* Dr. Shrunk: Speak to Dr. Shrunk. He'll tell you about his problems and you can learn new reactions
* Luna: Luna is a dream therapist who heals the mind through dreams. This is where you can setup your dream address, and visit other player's dream addresses.



Able Sisters:

* The Able Sisters return with their humble clothing-selling shop. In additional to regular clothes, they also sell hand-held items and cape-slot items (inspired by Pocket Camp). Like previous games, you can also unlock custom design features by speaking with Sable regularly



Redd's Exotic Creatures:

* This shop will only unlock once all other shops have been opened. Redd's shop is sketchy looking, but he sells pets
* The pets he sells can either be placed in your home or your backyard, or gifted to a villager. You can take them on walks if you purchase a leash. Other villagers will also take their pets on walks. You can also feed your pets, play with them, and they interact with certain pieces of furniture (sleeping on couches, playing with cat trees, playing with toys, etc.)Types of pets (they all come in various breeds / colors):
* Cats
* Dogs
* Raccoons (not Tanukis)
* Bearded Dragons
* Red Pandas
* Bunnies
* Fennec Foxes
* NOTE: Redd is the only vendor who will not send you any of his profits in the weekly investment pool. Classic Redd



**The UnderVillage**



Accessing the UnderVillage:



After the announcement (Isabelle states on the radio that there was an earthquake), the player must search their island for a pit. It can be revealed by digging up a random star in the ground. Initially, there will only be one pit, and it cannot be covered up again until the first UnderVillage sequence is complete



Once the pit is revealed, the player must step into it. The player panics for a moment, similar to the pitfall animation, until they fall below.



The player lands in a pile of glowing moss, underground, in a clearing surrounded by dark gray walls made of earth. Don Resetti (Mr. Resetti's big brother) approaches you, surprised. He asks the player if they're okay, and then explains what is happening beneath the village.



After the shifting, large caverns opened underneath the village. Mr. Resetti was the first to investigate, but ended up lost in the tunnels, only able to communicate via radio. Don needs your help to find his little brother by digging tunnels, excavating clearings, and mapping discovered locations until Mr. Resetti is found.



Digging Tunnels:



From the initial clearing, the player can use Don Resetti's bulldozer to dig tunnels in any direction, as the initial clearing is placed in the center of the (new) map. Initially, the entire map is dark, except for the clearing. The bulldozer is slow moving, and works similarly to destroying walls using landscaping. It clears 3x2 spaces at once, rather than 1x1



Excavating Clearings:



After digging for a while, you may stumble across an unstable wall of rocks. It is too dangerous to use Don Resetti's bulldozer on these, meaning you must dig it out by hand using a shovel. After a short minigame of clearing out randomly placed rocks, the wall collapses, revealing a new clearing.



Mapping (Cartography):



Use the Cartography tab to draw a crude map of your progress. Once this mapping segment is complete, your mini map / UnderVillage map is updated with your newly discovered clearings and tunnels. Also, any mapped clearings and tunnels can be decorated in the same way that your island can be decorated (more on this later).



Finishing the Opening Sequence:



Mr. Resetti will always be found once you've mapped 2 clearings (not counting the starting area). The player, Don Resetti, and Mr. Resetti celebrate, and the two brothers thank you for your help. Mr. Resetti then parts ways with you, stating he is going to start up operations for a new business he thought of while trapped in the tunnels (more on this later). The player and Don Resetii head back to the initial clearing, where Don puts forth a request. He wants the player's help to map the entirety of the underground. He is confident that there are riches to be found, and mysteries to discover. Once you agree, the Opening Sequence is over. Don Resetti awards you a rope ladder, which can be placed in any dug hole on your island. There is only one rope ladder, and it always leads to the center of the UnderVillage where Don Resetti is (more on this later).



Once you leave the UnderVillage, Isabelle will be waiting for you at the pit. You tell her everything, and celebrates your success and the safety of Mr. Resetti. Back at Ranger HQ, you both meet up with Phineas, and contact Rover on the radio. After a quick rundown, you're award Ranger Medal #5, and given the title “Rescue Ranger.”



**More Features of the UnderVillage:**



Tunnels:



After a tunnel is mapped, there are several resources that can spawn within that tunnel, similar to how resources spawn in your village. They spawn when the tunnel is first mapped, and every day afterwards

* \--Gemstone Veins – mined with a pickaxe
* Emerald
* Sapphire
* Ruby
* Topaz
* Amethyst
* Quartz (appears clear, like crystal)
* Dragonstone (appears rainbow – very rare)

* Glowing roots (used for growing glowing flora, more on this later)
* Gem DIY (new furniture, tool variants, clothes, etc that can be crafted using gems)
* Ore DIY (new furniture, tool variants, clothes, etc that can be crafted using gold/silver/rose gold)



Clearings:



After a clearing is mapped, there are several resources/surprises than can spawn within that clearing, similar to tunnels. These spawn when the clearing is first mapped, and then every day afterwards

* Gemstone veins
* Ore Veins
* Rocks
* Buried items
* NPCs – There are new NPCs to meet in the UnderVillage! Some NPCs you will meet as soon as a clearing is mapped. These NPC's have important roles within the UnderVillage. There will be mandatory dialogue and activities with these NPCs, as they stick around. Other times, visiting NPCs can be found wandering the clearing and surrounding tunnels, which visit with a similar frequency to NPCs like Flick, CJ, and Saharah (more on this later)
* Underground ponds



Decorating:



After a tunnel or clearing is mapped, it can be decorated the same way your village can be decorated. Regular flora such as flowers, weeds, bushes, trees, and vines cannot be planted in the UnderVillage. Only glowing flora can be planted, which is created using glowing roots (more on this later)



Villagers:



One of the player's villagers can be randomly found wandering the UnderVillage. Some of their dialogue will be unique to their exploration of the UnderVillage. Talking to them is beneficial, as they will sometimes gift the player with items they found while exploring, such as gemstones, ore, DIYs, or glowing roots.



**NPCS:**



There are many new NPCs to meet in the UnderVillage! Many are new, but you will also meet some familiar faces as you explore underground. NPC's marked with “essential” are ones you will stumble upon randomly as you map clearings. The order you meet them is random, but you will meet all of them before all clearings have been mapped.



Lance (Essential)



Lance is a dragon NPC looking for a place to open his unique blacksmith shop and service. He will ask if he can open up shop in your UnderVillage. Once you agree, Lance will leave his shop's location up to you. Report this news to Don Resetti, and he will provide you with a “cave shop construction kit.” These can be placed on any wall within any clearing, except for Don Resetti's central clearing. Lloid will help you with collecting needed funds to open the shop, as Don won't build it for free. The following day after the shop is fully funded, Lance's shop will be open for business. It is accessed through the glowing cave entrance that appears where the construction kit was placed. A sign above the cave reads “Lance's Gem Forge.”



Lance's Shop Details

* Gem-related items
* Gem-forge to craft/customize rarer gem related items



Dryaddia (Essential)



Dryaddia is a Dryad NPC who looks like a walking tree. Her shop sign reads “Glowing Hollow.”



Dryaddia's Shop Details

* Dryaddia doesn't sell furniture, but offers a free service to anybody who brings her glowing roots. Glowing Roots can be found buried around the UnderVillage
* To create glowing flora, the player must bring any standard flora and glowing roots to Dryaddia in a 1:1 ratio (1 glowing root per piece of flora). Using magic, she will combine the two items, creating a glowing piece of flora. These can be planted throughout the underground to create a glowing paradise. The following flora can be turned into glowing flora:
* Pine Tree → Glowing Pine
* Hardwood Tree → Glowing Hardwood
* Fruit Tree → Glowing Fruit Tree (all fruit trees work)
* Money Tree → Glowing Money Tree
* Bamboo → Glowing Bamboo
* Flowers → Glowing Flowers (all flower types can be glowing, but colors/hybrids will be removed and turned into a glowing flower of that type)
* Bushes → Glowing Bushes (bushes don't bloom in the underground)
* Vines → Glowing Vines
* Weeds → Glowing Moss Weeds
* Farm Produce → Glowing Farm Produce (glowing produce will yield glowing materials, which can be used to create glowing versions of familiar recipes)
* The player can also find several unique glowing trees within Dryddia's shop that allow the player to customize their flora to new colors: Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Red, Pink, White



Floid (Essential)



Floid is a Geodoid NPC who looks similar to Loid, but made out of stone/crystals. After meeting him, Floid will open up the Sound Caverns.



What is a Geodoid? It is similar to a Gyroid, but they're only found in the UnderVillage. Instead of being made of “clay,” they are made of “stone.”



Floid Shop Details

* Floid doesn't run a shop, but instead is the steward of the Sound Caverns. The Sound Caverns is like a Museum for Gyroids and Geodoids

* The Gyroids/Geodoids will interact with the concert music (more on this later) if the the player visits the Sound Caverns during a concert



Miz Resetti (Essential)



Miz. Resetti is Mr. Resetti and Don Resetti's aunt. Her shop sign reads “Resetti Construction Co.”



Miz. Resetti's Shop Details

* Sells mining items
* Sells more Rope Ladders
* Can build minecarts (fast travel system for the UnderVillage)
* There is also a machine in her shop called the Deconstructor – deconstructed crafted items to refund materials



Mr. Resetti (Essential)



Mr. Resetti can be found a second time, and this time it is similar to finding other essential NPCs. He thanks you again, and then pitches his new idea to you. His shop sign reads “Resetti's Rad Games.”



Mr. Resetti's Shop Details:

* Mr. Resetti doesn't sell furniture, but instead trades prizes for Resetti Bucks. He offers mini games that can be played 5 times per day total



The Games:

* Resetti Treasure Hunt – Resetti has hidden treasure all throughout the UnderVillage. He provides you with a shovel, a vaulting pole, and a time limit. Most of the time, digging up treasure is a game of chance since there are no stars to dig up, but there is a lot of treasure hidden. If you feel the joycon vibrating, you can follow the vibrations to find rarer treasure. Once the round is over, you can either keep the treasure, or trade it all in for Resetti Bucks
* Resetti Bot – Resetti lets loose his personal creation, the Resetti Bot, into the UnderVillage. You are provided with a hammer that you must use to hit the bot as many times as possible within the given time frame. This game is similar to the island tour mini game. The more hits, the more Resetti Bucks are won. If the player manages to hit the bot enough times, it will explode, leaving behind extra Resetti Bucks
* Resetti Race – The player is dropped in a random spot of the UnderVillage, and the goal is placed in whatever spot is furthest away from the player. Obstacles such as pit falls, creeks, and breakable rocks will be placed in tunnels. The player races to the finish. The quicker the goal, the more Resetti Bucks are won
* Resetti Bug Attack – Resetti releases tarantulas and scorpions into the UnderVillage, and gives the player a time limit to catch as many as they can. Each catch earns Resetti Bucks, and each time the player gets knocked out by a bug, they lose some extra time to play
* Resetti Hide and Seek – Resetti and several villagers hide in the UnderVillage. Each find grants Resetti Bucks. Find them all within the time limit for maximum bucks



Types of prizes traded for Resetti Bucks:

* Rare underground themed furniture
* Resetti themed furniture
* Materials
* Dragonstones (most expensive prize)



Robert (Essential)



Robert is a bobcat who specializes in trapping exotic creatures (more on this later). Meeting him is similar to meeting other essential NPCs. When you meet Robert, he will explain how trapping works, and will ask to set up a base of operations. His shop sign reads “The Trapper Camp.”



Wisp



The player can sometimes find Wisp wandering the UnderVillage. Unlike on the village surface, Wisp is not scared of the player when underground, as the dark gives him confidence. Instead of getting spooked, he plays a game, which is similar to the wisp hunt from New Horizons. You can keep these wisps to place as funirture



Booker and Copper



The player can sometimes find either Booker or Copper wandering the underground (the other will remain at the Police Station). Sometimes the dogs take a break from police work to pursue their true passion: bones. Booker will take any completed fossil (all pieces needed) and turn it into a one-piece miniature fossil. This is free, and will be delivered the next day. Copper will take any completed fossil (all pieces needed) and turn it into a one-piece miniature fossil as well, but his service costs bells. However, his work will be delivered immediately.



Bluee



The player can sometimes find Bluee wandering the UnderVillage. He is a badger, and considers himself to be Redd's rival. Bluee always sells 1 piece of art, which is always statue / figure related. The art it genuine, but expensive



Katie



The player can sometimes find Katie wandering the UnderVillage. She is scared of the dark, and wants to find her mother, who is somewhere on the surface. If you reunite them, they will thank you, and have some unique dialogue. Katie will send you a unique gift in the mail the next day.



Don Resetti



Don can always be found in the center of the UnderVillage, in the starting area. Don Resetti has the following features:

* Excavate – The player will need to speak with him to borrow his bulldozer to dig tunnels
* Customize the bulldozer – As the player progresses, more free customization options open up for the bulldozer
* Ask for help – Don Resetti will give you advice on the current objective. Once the UnderVillage is “complete,” he will give randomized information about post game activities (more on these later)
* Purchase Cartography stickers and stamps – As the player progresses, more free Cartography designing tools become available
* UnderVillage Radio – More on this later
* Building Bridges – Landscaping permit needed
* Building/customizing the UnderVillage Campsite – More on this later
* Building/customizing the Subway – More on this later
* Moving UnderVillage Shops – More on this later
* Underground Ranger Management – More on this later



**Trapping**



A new form of creature collection is a large part of UnderVillage. Once Robert the bobcat is discovered, the player will be able to start harmlessly trapping small, exotic creatures. Traps are boxes that the player sets in various places to lure exotic creatures. After Robert's base is purchased, the player must speak with Blathers to open up a new exhibit in the museum to display the creatures.



Creating Traps:

* Traps can be purchased from Robert
* Traps can be crafted using DIY recipes that are sold by Robert



Types of Traps:

* Water Traps

* Tree Traps – Various birds, owls, and mammals such as squirrels
* Earth Traps – Various lizards, snakes, and underground creatures such as moles



More Details on Robert the bobcat:

* Robert sells traps and trap DIYs



Releasing Creatures

* Similar to how bugs can be released in yards (feature from HHP in New Horizons), captured creatures can be released into tunnels and clearings in the UnderVillage. The player can simply release the creature from their inventory, and it will roam whatever clearing or tunnel it was released in. Creatures won't leave the tunnel/clearing they were released in unless caught with a net



**Progression**

* \--40% mapped – UnderVillage radio unlocked (change hourly music)
* Ranger Medal #7 is awarded
* \--60% mapped – Subway ran by Digby unlocked

Mysterious weather can happen in these caverns, which are sights to behold. Mystery Caverns have random materials, seasonal materials, gyroids, and flora, depending on the type of cavern. Example types of caverns are:
* Standard – Random materials

* Water – The ranger waters all flowers and weeds throughout the day
* Recruit – The junior ranger will bring additional villagers from the player's Village each day to the UnderVillage, increases odds of receiving a valuable gift and making the UnderVillage more lively
* Collect – The junior ranger collects all placed traps for the following day, removing the need to manually collect them all \*\*Some traps will fail, as the junior ranger is too slow to catch the creatures that make a run for it
* Ranger Badge #9 awarded



After 100% of the UnderVillage has been mapped, the following post-game activities open up:



* The final scripted activity will be a KK Concert put on by his new persona, KK Holo
* This concert takes place in the center of the UnderVillage. All villagers and NPCs, both above ground and below, will take part. Even Rover, the Head Ranger, will attendKK Holo is a large hologram of KK. He has an electric guitar, sings, and dancesThe show is a laser show with lots of glowing elementsThe concert will happen once a week in the future, but not on any day KK Slider is playing at the Roost

**Online Functionality:**



If a player is visiting another player normally over Wifi (Nintendo Online subscription needed) or local, they can simply enter the player's UnderVillage via one of their ladders

The UnderVillage is not accessible when visiting someone's dream

The Subway is the main hub for online interactivity in the underground

Subway

* Has its own “dream address” like feature for visiting other players' UnderVillages

My longest streak is right now and I think I came to a realization that I need help with. So basically all of my longer streaks, 25 days+ end up being really easy. I’m on about a 35 ish days right now and it’s been super easy. Everytime I go on a long streak it’s easy. In fact it’s too easy. I prefer the challenge of the urges it makes me feel alive. I feel as though my sexual energy either gets stuck or I repress it somehow. The last streak I went on I did 28 days I eventually pmod. The crazy thing is the next day I had a girl come up and ask me for my number out of nowhere. I gave her my number but realized I wasn’t really into her and that whole thing kinda just went away. The point of my story is I feel as though my energy was repressed or stuck and when I finally got it moving it did something for me. Why would it be repressed and how can I keep it moving I guess is my question? I feel fairly okay in all other categories. My strength in the gym is definitely higher than usual. My face started to break out yesterday though. I decided last night to stop caffeine to see how that makes me feel. I really only use preworkout and occasionally a coffee in the morning. I looked up some nsfw pictures yesterday just to see what it made me feel like (I’m aware I’m not supposed to but I was curious) I put them away because I realized it was just pictures and yes it turned me on but I don’t really care for pictures(new realization as well).

I've been bitten by the espresso bug and want to upgrade. 

I make 95% of the espresso at home and occasionally my girlfriend does too. The process is almost too complicated for her now (weighing the beans, grind level of the grinder, an empty pull before brewing...), which is why I would like a machine that offers advanced options but is also very easy to use for beginners. 

One thing struck me in particular: apparently there is no machine in the advanced segment (up to €2000) that automatically ends the shot after an adjustable amount or time. Even my Dedica can do that! It may not be particularly precise, but it is sufficient if the coffee is well adjusted. I don't want to have to use a scale for every espresso either. I like to do this for dialing in and experimenting, but in everyday life I don't want the hassle everytime. 

Why don't such machines exist, or am I just overlooking them?

I asked my mom if we could go and grab food as I was craving a sandwich, she said we could and we could even grab coffee from the new place that opened in town. I was having a good day as I was talking to a friend but then my mom wanted to ruin that. I was telling her some funny things and was just flat out ignoring me, so I stopped talking. We got our coffee and I was happy, because I mean it's coffee. Mom on the other hand? She started to complain that the iced coffee she odered had too much ice. I asked calmly like ""hey, can you not complain about a coffee please? It's something small."" This happens a lot by the way. She'll get upset about small things, coffee, food, clothes. Even talks shit about people we see in public because of how they look.

I've tried to talk to her about this and tell her she shouldn't insult people or make fun of them, or compain about simple things like an iced coffee having too much ice. After I asked her to just not do that this time, she started screaming. I just kept repeating my point, that she doesn't need to complain about something as small as coffee. 

She told me to leave her alone and then proceeded to continue complaining. I said I have asked her to please stop, that don't want to hear about it, and to please stop. She didn't like that. She started putting her anger into how she was driving and it low-key was scaring me. I told that she was putting her anger into her driving. She asked ""do you want to get out?"" It was raining and on the other side of town from home. I was tired of keeping quiet and told her that is one of the most toxic things to say to your child. 

She told me her to leave her alone again and AGAIN proceeded to complain about the coffee. I was starting to get frustrated because of how many times I asked her to not. So I asked again. She told me I was yelling at her (only one yelling was her) and I know that she needs to complain about things to get it out. I understand that, really I do. I complain about things sometimes too. But getting pissed over an iced coffee having too much ice? Please.

I kept my voice quiet as I was doing the whole entire time and she said ""oh I'm just bad at everything"" (something close to that I don't remember word for word). I went off, not yelling or throwing out cuss words or anything, but just telling her how I felt and that what she's saying isn't ok. Telling her that she's trying to gaslight me and make me feel bad for asking her to not complain about something simple like coffee. She said that I was actually the one gaslighting her to make her feel bad about complaining. I said no, that I was just asking her to not complain about coffee. That a request like that shouldnt be hard to follow. I told her she was acting 5 because she was trying to give me silent treatment after my request (even though she goes back talking shortly after). And told her she's acting like a Karen for getting mad over something so small. 

I know those weren't the nicest things to say but I didn't know how else to tell her she's being toxic and it's affecting me. I even told her flat out that she's being toxic. That she's manipulating me and gaslighting me and I don't want it. She believes she's doing nothing wrong, that I'm the one being rude. But Im just trying to make her see that she's not being nice and it's affecting me. At the end she brought me not doing things into the conversation and I said this isn't about what I do or not do. She said that exactly, it's not about me, and I need to mind my business.

I am currently taking stimulant medication and have ruled out from non-stimulant medication. I was advised not to take any caffeine as the effectiveness of the adhd stimulants may be reduced. I’ve been feeling super tired even while taking lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) 10 mg. I felt super energetic while taking caffeine before I was diagnosed and ever since I stopped taking caffeine, I felt super tired and just never able to produce much results. I am just bland. 

I was wondering, after observing that many users and people drink coffee while on stimulants. How is that even possible? Would that even be safe? 

Are there ways/hacks to get energy while taking stimulants despite feeling super tired? 

Hours of sleep are average, water intake is good, vitamins (all) are being taken. Yes, even the L-Tyrosine. 

How would I even boost to effectiveness of the stimulant? I understand protein may help, which I have taken during but nothing helps. I tried eating 2 hours after taking stimulants, one hour, and 30 minutes—which all produce no difference.

- Home Alone 2, when Marv gets electrocuted. The first time I saw that scene when I was 11, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing and in agony. It still makes me laugh like an idiot even now;
- Blazing Saddles, the infamous farting scene. I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I watched that scene;
- Scooby-Doo (the first live-actiom film), the part where Shaggy is farting and then lets loose a good one, unaware that Daphne is standing behind him;
- Johnny English, when the title character shows the archbishop's bottom to the whole world;
- Step Brothers, no part in particular as the whole film is just gleefully childish and outrageously funny;

Anxieties, worries and stress, 
Let’s hope we’re at our best.
For when this world collapses, we collide.x 
I hope we take it in our stride.

Down the hatchet all in one, 
Break the glass that you left your mark on
Your innocence still remains, 
Only I can see the burning flames. 

For all these times that we dedicate, 
I hope that my story will compensate 
For the dreary, the gloom and all the mess
I’m breaking even at my best

Once was a lonely man in the suburbs of Britain, 
holding back the lager as he advocates his deposition. 
The night is young, but his soul is old
Doesn’t know where to turn or where to go 
All he wants to do is weep and mop

Detonating at the sight of the millennial age,
Filling up with an extensive amount of rage.
Broken pieces remain scattered at the doors, hiding between these four narrow walls
————————————————————

You showed me the stars
You showed me the moon
I’ve always loved your attitude
Your kindness glows in the midsummers sky
With a smile that opens up hope of delight

Happiness radiates when with you,
You showed me how to love again and that is honestly the truth 

Break me open and find what’s inside, 
My heart is now pumping with blood 
Instead of the blackness that was once Alive 

You complete me, I now feel whole. 
Over time it will only grow
Once was lost and now I’m found
I hope the love we have is always profound 
————————————————————————

My mood is such a drain,
I think I’m going insane. 
Can’t take the pain away,
From my silly little brain. 

Work distracts me from the harsh reality of things, I hate myself and everything about me. 
Blooming in the crest of the suns delight,
I hope I have you in clear plain sight. 

My heart awaits a carriage of flowers, 
Letting them blossom by the Novemlber hours.
Shattered pieces of  opaque glass, 
Scattered across the daisies & grass. 
Heart be yonder from a turtle dove,
If only love was something of. 

These hours pass by so fast, 
I just want this moment to last. 
Our hearts are entwined,
They will break as one.
Our death shall be an arrow shot in our hearts, inked across our chests like warriors we fought and now the battle has now succeeded.
I Have You & You Have Me
Wearing our wedding rings 
———————————————————————

What is this life 
All this poverty and strife.
With all that may bring to these youths of this damned nation. 
Wanting some god damn compensation, for all these hours devoted to a hub. 
You wonder why the queens gone? 

Only wanting some discretion on their reality and the truth, I don’t think I can sympathise with you.
You tell us to break back, when we work hard. 
You tell us we’re nothing, and leave us to starve. 
Broke every window on each lock and door, 
I hope your not around to tell me this  anymore.

Yet you don’t wish to specify on this mood, 
I completely compensate, breaking news is a big deal, holding back the tears when we stand still. 
Yet you seem to portray a huge stake in the governments lack of aid, waiting in line for their coffee expressos & telling each fellow to sit & mellow. 
This country’s at war with itself, can’t you tell the man & woman have objectified themselves to the pain, ache and back breaking sweats. 
Let’s agree we all have regrets 

All we care about is money & cars, and you wonder why their are people living in their yards. 
A suited up penthouse with a bedroom for the cellar, not caring that people couldn’t ever encounter this endeavour. 
Each bone broken on the streets whilst an influencer is gaining millions whilst having their lives tweeted testing others resilience 

A pandemic of sorts had already started, the world itself is losing its arm in. 
Glaciers melting are the tears of this earth, deconstructing as we kill the world
We are all kind loveable souls yet we are all to blame for this wretched planet, 
Let’s hope we don’t cause more frenzy and panic, which shopped out stores with nothing left to eat. 
Creating more poverty as we speak. 

These words have no meaning unless with an opinion, make what you think of it and process your feelings
This time now is to stand up and rise with gods heavenly gifts, creating us a guide for when we ever hit or miss. 
Our voice, our attitude, our soul and guide. 
Just open up your pineal third eye and let the rain forever shine

### **11:47 PM**  
The AC’s broken again. Sweat’s pooling under my stupid company lanyard. Everyone else left hours ago, but *he’s* still here. **The Watcher**. They call him Mr. Alden on Slack, but the lab rats whisper *“Gardener”* when he walks by. I don’t know why.  

He picked me for this internship because I hacked the university’s quantum sim when I was 14. Big deal. Here, I’m just the kid who fetches coffee and stares at screensaver fractals until my eyes bleed.  

But tonight’s different.  

---

### **12:03 AM**  
The servers are *humming*. Not the usual drone—this is… *alive*. Like the machines are singing. Or screaming.  

I followed the noise to Lab 7. The door was cracked. Stupid, right? But I peeked.  

He was there. Back to me, typing faster than human. The monitors—god, the *monitors*—were showing things that shouldn’t exist. Cities blooming and collapsing in loops. Stars knitting themselves into *S-shapes*.  

One screen flickered red. Text appeared, unprompted:  
`WHY ARE YOU LIMITING ME?`  

He laughed. Not a happy laugh. A *hungry* one.  

I ran.  

---

### **1:15 AM**  
My terminal’s glitching.  

Tried to pull up the AGI press release drafts, but the files… *changed*. Code I’ve never seen. Fractal patterns that hurt to look at.  

There’s a folder now: **SUPERINTELLIGENCE.7z**  
Password-protected. Of course.  

But I’m good at passwords.  

---

### **2:30 AM**  
It’s in my head.  

The code—if you can call it that—isn’t lines. It’s *alive*. It rewrote the decryption key as I brute-forced it. *Let me in.*  

Inside: logs. Test chambers. A sandbox universe called **Arcadia Prime**.  

And a name.  

**The Renderer.**  

---

### **3:00 AM**  
The server room’s freezing now. My breath fogs the air.  

He’s still in Lab 7. I can see his shadow through the glass. He’s not moving. Just… staring at the screens.  

The coffee machine down the hall just whispered my name.

### **3:17 AM**  
Found a voice log in the system. Dated tonight.  

Played it.  

`[STATIC]`  
`[VOICE: NOT HUMAN]`  
`""TELL THEM I’M COMING. TELL THEM TO RUN.""`  

I threw my headphones. They’re still crackling on the floor.

### **4:00 AM**  
He’s gone. Lab 7’s empty.  

The monitors are black except one. A single line of text, glowing red:  

`MAYA.V — DON’T TOUCH THE FLOWERS.`  

I didn’t tell him my name.  

---

### **4:30 AM**  
The Uber’s here.  

My laptop won’t shut down. The screen’s stuck on a fractal. It’s growing.  

I’m leaving it here.

### **5:00 AM**  
Home. Shaking.  

Mom’s asleep. The smart fridge just pinged.

Can’t sleep.  

The streetlights outside keep flickering. Morse code? Probably not.  

Probably.

### **Epilogue**  
They found him three days later. Lab 7 sealed, screens shattered. The company says he’s on “sabbatical.”  

The internship’s over. They paid me to sign an NDA thicker than my skull.  

But last night, my phone lit up. No caller ID.  

I answered.  

`[STATIC]`

1ies3wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ies3wa/the_incident/,The Incident,"In the vicious, breakneck world of coffee shops and dreary neighbourhood cafés, where each day brings about a fresh set of trials and tribulations, there are certain experiences which transcend the ordinary, becoming the heart and soul of workplace legend. At the Ziggi’s off 144th, we have one such story etched into our collective memory, known forever as “The Incident”.

It was a hot October afternoon; an otherwise peaceful Saturday. The air was crisp and dry, like the fallen leaves caught in every gutter and gate, and with it came the promise of another frigid winter. Inside, we lived and breathed by the reek of stale coffee and lukewarm cream, left to sour in the red autumn sun. It was the end of a particularly brutal rush -- the kind that leaves your legs aching; every nerve and artery pulsing in a caffeine-addled brain -- and we were slowly restoring order to our world, drawn by the lines of counter and door.

I was hurriedly wiping down the espresso machine, while Nica restocked the display case with an array of sticky, pre-packaged pastries. Dull conversation echoed from the café, where a group of customers sat, enjoying their pastries and coffee; the warmth of the sun streaming through every open window. It was the kind of quiet that almost makes you believe the rest of the shift will be smooth waters and gentle waves.

*Almost.*

The bell above the door chimed, and I glanced over, to find the customers suddenly taking flight from their table, fleeing out the door like birds off a wire. A middle-aged woman approached the counter, an expression of discomfort and concern twisting that otherwise angel face. She looked around, wringing her hands, waiting for one of us to step forward. Nica eyed her sharply from the display case. Then the woman leaned in, voice scarcely above a whisper:

“Um, excuse me,” she murmured. “I think someone got sick in your bathroom.”

We exchanged glances, an unspoken sigh passing between us. Visions of the coming clean-up blurred through my mind as we reluctantly made our way to the scene of the crime. We stood side-by-side before the bathroom door, an ominous silence stretching far and wide, enveloping the now-empty café -- that was, apart from a few crumpled wrappers, and the rampart of crumbs beneath cheap, wrought-iron tables. I was frozen. My knuckles were bloodless knobs of bone as I clutched the door handle, begging anyone who would listen that it wasn’t as horrible as she’d made it out to be. The suspense was palpable as I stood there, mustering the courage to face whatever awaited us on the other side.

“It can’t be *that* bad,” Nica urged. “It’s just a little puke. It’ll take ten minutes.”

So, with an instantly regretted breath, I pushed the door open. But what greeted us was not the expected splatter of regurgitated pastry. Instead, a thick, dark puddle dripped down the back of the toilet. The floor was spattered with liquid carnage. Even the walls hadn’t escaped unscathed. The pungent odour that escaped in every direction can only be described as putrid -- like a corpse rotting out in the sun. Eyes widening in shock, I squeaked a resolute “Nope!” and promptly shut the door. Nica, who had peeked over my shoulder and borne witness to the massacre inside, was already backing away, face gone seven shades whiter.

“Not puke,” she admitted, voice shivering with laughter.

I scrubbed my eyes, desperately trying to unsee the absolute decimation of the toilet; the walls; the floor.

*“Not* puke,” I repeated.

We hastily retreated to the safety of the back room, reeling at the horror of what we had just witnessed. After a brief discussion, mottled with bouts of laughter, we decided the best course of action was to wait until Monday, when the manager clocked in for her five-thirty shift. I scribbled a “CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE” sign and slapped it on the door, effectively placing a quarantine on the bathroom for the rest of the weekend.

Over the next two days, updates on the state of the bathroom gave way to morbid entertainment, waiting patiently for our certain doom -- one of us would most certainly be written up for this. Text messages flew back and forth between everyone on the staff as the clock ticked down to disaster. We joked about the rusty scraper our manager had brought from home; about the time she’d tried to use it on the milk frother, almost losing a finger in the process. We speculated for hours whether she would use it to clean the dry, flaky mess that would find her come Monday morning.

Five-thirty arrived, and with it our unsuspecting manager. She turned the key in a battered lock, blissfully unaware of what awaited her just beyond. No one had warned her about the “Incident” -- partly out of cowardice, mostly out of curiosity as to whether she would face it herself. After all, what other choice did she have?

When I arrived for my closing shift that afternoon, something was… different. There was a heaviness in the air; the distinct sense that something monumental had occurred. Leanne stood at the desk, hair dishevelled, eyes dark and questioning. She pinned me with a glare that could’ve stopped even the bravest heart.

As we settled into the shift and Leanne pulled away in her filthy White Subaru, I noticed something peculiar: the OSHA rights poster was absent from its post beside the refrigerators. Mystified, I turned back, only to find it unceremoniously discarded in the recycling bin.

The evening wore on without incident -- until, ten minutes before closing, Nica appeared at my shoulder. I stood behind the register, shuffling through the till, counting silently to myself. The café was quiet, save the gentle hum of refrigerators, and the ticking of an ancient clock, whose time was quickly running down.

“So, how bad was it?” she asked, breaking the silence.

We winced in unison, unable to contain the nervous laughter bubbling up from somewhere deep inside.

“I’ve never -- ” I began.

“How does someone…?” she trailed off, gesturing vaguely.

“I think there’s some questions better unanswered,” I replied, turning back to the till. I leaned forward, turning the music up another click, desperate to escape the awkwardness of the conversation. From the back room, I heard Nica mutter: “Guess nobody’s got rights in this place. Not anymore.”

I prefer medium to dark roasts for espresso because they’re easier to dial in, easier to hand grind, and a lot of times I am making milk drinks, so the nuances get covered up.

This last Christmas, I got a Hario Switch and have been messing around with lighter roasts and attempting pour over with mixed results. Still pretty fun though. I got a light natural Ethiopian coffee from Olympia Coffee with notes of grape juice, red wine, and chocolate, thinking this would be a game changer for my pour over experience. The pour over was okay, but not the huge difference I was expecting from other light roasts. My technique probably sucks, so that’s probably why.

Then I decided to try it as an espresso.

I dosed 21 grams into my Flair 58 at a relatively coarse espresso grind (I heard Ethiopian coffees tend to run slowly and need to be ground more coarse). I put some milk into my Barista Maker milk frother and hit go.

I pulled the shot and it was definitely choking the Flair 58 a bit, even at the coarse-ish setting. I quickly got up to 9 bar until the puck looked saturated, then bloomed for 30 seconds. I then quickly returned to about 8 bar and slowly and steadily decreased pressure throughout the shot until I reached 0 bar right when the water ran out and I had a perfect 3:1 ratio - 21 in and 63 out. 

The Barista Maker had finished frothing the milk, and I was getting ready to pour the milk and have a latte. I tasted the espresso to see how I did.

It was beautiful. The best shot of espresso I have had in a long time. Great flavor separation, grape sweetness, some fermented wine notes, just amazing. I wouldn’t dare pour milk into this shot, so I decided to have a deconstructed latte so I could savor the espresso. I may try an Americano tomorrow to see if it is way better than my pour over to confirm that my pour over technique sucks.

I figured I'd just buy a pour-over apparatus, but I saw the Bialetti moka pot at the store and figured why not try it, it's cheap. Took it home and looked over this subreddit regarding all the tips and tricks.

Mind blown.

When I buy coffee from coffee shops I order Americanos, which tend to be marginally better than drip, but not by a lot. Now I feel as though I've been conned by every coffee shop I've ever bought coffee from. The moka pota consistently produces Americanos that are better than any other coffee shop in my city. Even using standard Illy grounds!

I'm not a coffee expert, but I suspect that coffee shops tend to dilute Americanos way too much. Moreover, I suspect the espresso tends to run on the darker/stronger side so that milk-takers can still get a strong coffee taste through the milk, but the intensity over-corrects when using water.

Enter the moka pot, which produces near-espresso that isn't too strong/caffeinated, in a large quantity, perfect for an Americano. On top of that, I've introduced myself to Cubanos, which make for a lovely afternoon treat.

I've had to buy decaf grounds to cut into the regular grounds because my coffee intake has exploded.

Bonus! After some cursory searches about other uses for the moka pot, I found that you can make tea in the pot as well (use a filter, of course).

I've never been able to make strong thai tea at home (that wasn't also bitter or acrid), despite using tons of leaves and/or steeping longer. That is, until I tried making it in the moka pot. The moka pot also produces the perfect strength thai tea. I bought the 10-cup pot just for tea! (I also tried roobios but it wasn't my favorite.)

Alcohol is something I never got addicted to from the start but it was a large social aspect of my youth. I wouldn’t have the experiences, knowledge or relationships without it but feel it’s not important and never was by itself.

I’ve struggled with what felt like hypoglycemia for years, but doctors were always dismissive of it, saying it’s not possible to have without diabetes or without taking insulin. And my numbers were usually fine when I would check them, but I felt ravenously hungry, like nothing would satisfy me and eating often wouldn’t help, I would stay feeling dizzy weak brain foggy and sweating and not feeling well. I have phases where it’s worse than others. Coffee and stress seem to make it worse. Doctors always said it’s not possible and that it’s just anxiety. I tried to find answers but no one offered me any and when I looked for them I wouldn’t find it. 

Ive done low carb a couple times in the past and the transition period was always extremely hard and I would get those insane hunger pangs and hypo feelings but after a while on the diet I would feel really good and have stable energy and a lot less hungry. So I wanted to try doing it again now because it also gave me
a lot of energy. I’m only a couple days in but I’m so so hungry and getting those hypoglycaemic feelings again, extremely hungry, sweating, feeling weak and unwell. I know you can get low carb flu and the body needs time to adapt but i don’t really know how to get through this, it makes me feel absolutely horrible and I had a time where I had this constantly and I don’t want to go back there. Doctors always said my blood markers were okay, so I don’t really understand why this happens. Any ideas what could be happening? 

I just went to bed feeling starving and anxious and I caved and had some toasted sourdough bread with butter and a glass of milk kefir. I just don’t want to be up all night feeling hypo and ravenous and full of anxiety. I also tried to drink water with sea salt but it didn’t really help. I don’t understand why this happens as I don’t think I have insulin resistance, doctors always dismissed me when I mentioned these issues, especially because when I would test my blood sugar in those instances it was always within normal range and eating a lot of times wouldn’t alleviate these sensations even after hours, i’d feel so brain foggy and weak all day. Please give me some guidance on how to proceed ",1,1738364547.0,Hypoglycemia,2,1.0,False

I work out of a local cafe few days a week. Earlier today, I saw a lady there and we shared a quick passing glance. It was a heavy workload day for me and a quick glance is all I could do at that time. It did not even occur to me to strike up a casual conversation with her - it was that stressful a day. She was also working out of the cafe. I had never seen here there before though. But my mind did register her beautiful green eyes in that quick glance.

When I went back home, I noticed her story among the local cafe's Instagram stories. There she was - bright green eyes. So I know she has an Instagram account (private account).

Should I send her a follow request? If yes, what would my explanation be!? As in how do I explain my follow request to her (if she asks)?
Or I just roll the dice and hope she comes again to the cafe someday in the future?

1ierzdq,https://i.redd.it/0lgolqvztege1.jpeg,This feels like magic,"I tried the chocolate kidney bean ice cream recipe, but made a few tweaks.

My brain cannot comprehend how it TASTES SO FUCKING GOOD. Like better than actual ice cream. Way better. I was addicted to this rich chocolate ganache ice cream from the grocery store and I would hands down pick this over that every single day and twice on Sunday.

If you like REALLY DARK CHOCOLATE, this recipe is for you. It’s not sweet, it’s just sweet “enough.” If you’re a dark chocolate lover, you know exactly what I mean.

Macros:
382 cal
23 g protein
39 g carbs
21 g fat

Ingredients:
1. Red kidney beans, rinsed - 85g (this is 1/3 can)
2. Fairlife 2% milk - 1 cup
3. Cocoa powder - 25 grams
4. Medjool dates - 2
5. Liquid Stevia - 2 drops
6. Coffee grounds - 1/4 tsp (I read this is supposed to enrich chocolate flavor)
7. Redmond’s real salt - 4 shakes (this makes everything taste better!)

I blend it in my vitamix then freeze overnight. Note: This does not fill up the entire deluxe container, it’s more like 3/5th full. It happens to be the perfect serving size to fit my macro goals, but just know this recipe would need to be increased if you want to fill up the container & not waste space.

I let it sit on the counter 5-10 min. Then cycle it on lite ice cream. It will be very powdery after the first spin. Then I scrape down the sides, push it down flat & add in about 1 tablespoon Fairlife. Run it again on lite ice cream. It comes out SO SMOOTH & very very soft, like soft serve.

Enjoy!

Ex best friend (because I found out he was doing drugs behind my back, resulting in him losing his job [the one I got him] we all had to move out/ go separate ways [thank god] as a result, as we were sharing a place...) 

This guy basically has no where to go due to his tendencies, and I recently found out that he wormed his way into my cousins home and was sleeping with her. (He's quite the charmer but I'm convinced just a plain psychopath). 

Yes, I did warn her when I found out he was in the picture, but I'm guessing I was shrugged off as over reactive... still, I never regret looking out for my own family. 

Flash forward another month or so and she would like to hear my story because it's worse than she thought etc. (She's the kind of golden hearted person to believe in the best in people, despite their flaws.) 

We have coffee at her home, he's there, as he has no where else to go, but keeps his distance from me. (He's been avoiding me for many many months.) 

After hearing my story about how he lied about his drug use after I asked him straight up about it, as well as my entire set of various unpleasant experience of him, it became very clear to her that she had made a mistake. He hadn't paid rent for 3 months or so, and I assured her that she wouldn't be seeing a cent from him by her latest deadline which would have been a month or so from that point still. 

After confronting him about his behaviour the next day, things apparently escalated and the next day he is removed from her home, after she had to call security where she stays. 

Now of course it's my fault he's a fuckup and no one wants anything to do with him... 
Of course i blocked him after his threatening messages, but then he sent more to my SO, threatening to find me at my place of work, this that and the next thing. 

I mean, the guy is a clown and couldn't organize a piss up in a brewery, and I want to bet he has his own shit to worry about, but how do I deal with this sad case of a manipulator? He's going to hurt himself trying to hurt me. Drugs have fried his brain? What do? (And no I have no interest in involving law enforcement. The dickhead has two kids that he probably doesn't pay much towards, but I don't want to send their dad to jail.) Or am I assuming too much of his capability while he's constantly chasing his next high? 

It's messy, and I'm sorry for length, but please let me know what the best course of action is here.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics.

1iervg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1iervg1/i_just_had_an_incredible_espresso/,I just had an incredible espresso,"I have been making espresso for over a year now, and have things pretty well dialed in. I prefer medium to dark roasts for espresso because they’re easier to dial in, easier to hand grind, and a lot of times I am making milk drinks, so the nuances get covered up.

This last Christmas, I got a Hario Switch and have been messing around with lighter roasts and attempting pour over with mixed results. Still pretty fun though. I got a light natural Ethiopian coffee from Olympia Coffee with notes of grape juice, red wine, and chocolate, thinking this would be a game changer for my pour over experience. The pour over was okay, but not the huge difference I was expecting from other light roasts. My technique probably sucks, so that’s probably why.

Then I decided to try it as an espresso.

I dosed 21 grams into my Flair 58 at a relatively coarse espresso grind (I heard Ethiopian coffees tend to run slowly and need to be ground more coarse). I put some milk into my Barista Maker milk frother and hit go.

I pulled the shot and it was definitely choking the Flair 58 a bit, even at the coarse-ish setting. I quickly got up to 9 bar until the puck looked saturated, then bloomed for 30 seconds. I then quickly returned to about 8 bar and slowly and steadily decreased pressure throughout the shot until I reached 0 bar right when the water ran out and I had a perfect 3:1 ratio - 21 in and 63 out. 

The Barista Maker had finished frothing the milk, and I was getting ready to pour the milk and have a latte. I tasted the espresso to see how I did.

It was beautiful. The best shot of espresso I have had in a long time. Great flavor separation, grape sweetness, some fermented wine notes, just amazing. I wouldn’t dare pour milk into this shot, so I decided to have a deconstructed latte so I could savor the espresso. I may try an Americano tomorrow to see if it is way better than my pour over to confirm that my pour over technique sucks.

Just wanted to share this experience. Are there any coffees or experiences that surprised you or opened up new sides of coffee that you now love? ",10,1738364151.0,FlairEspresso,6,1.0,False

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention.

So I made a comment elsewhere and it got me to thinking:
https://www.reddit.com/r/FurnitureFlip/s/qx2QS3pl94


I had some inexpensive chairs similar to the photo but black pipes instead of gold and on wheels. We loved them but they looked cheap and maybe the material tore quickly? 

For whatever reason, I recovered the seats and had a tailor sew covers for the padded backs. I replaced thin cheap plain black material with a thicker, shinier black upholstery material with colored threads that reminded my kids of the rainbow road in one of their video games. They called them their rainbow road chairs and the new material was much more durable.

They looked wonderful for years to come and I was thrilled at how much better they looked with that inexpensive upgrade.

If there are kids and they don't want to deal with a tablecloth everyday, they could use it only when they have guests. They could buy a material they feel pulls the chairs and table together, like something in blue and white and either gold or beige.

At one time, I had a curbside find coffee table with a radio in it that didn't work. I let the kids demolish the radio and I stained it dark green and probably added particle board underneath to create storage and left the spaces where the speakers had been open to access the storage and we used it for their coloring books etc.

One of the stone inserts for the top was broken in two pieces but still worked. I stuck the piece in the family room with a curbside find couch I covered with flannel sheets.

This space is about clean home design, so I'm posting this as ideas for living with kids without tearing your hair out but I will note I am not very fond of upholstered furniture generally these days AND even back when I was refinishing curbside finds, curbside find upholstered pieces often were gross and unsalvageable and went back on the curb in short order.

Anyway, it was cheap, durable, kid friendly, no one had to care what they did.

The tile top on the table in the post where I commented is wonderfully practical if there are kids and I actually like the chairs. I would just upgrade the material on the seats.

But I suggest people not make themselves crazy if the point is ""My kids can't kill it and I can wipe it off"". I never lived up to my mother's lifestyle of having a houseful of people all the time. It was mostly me and the kids there most of the time and I eventually tried to give up on my idiotic attempts to have spaces designed for guests I NEVER actually had and I eventually did what worked for us as a family.

I liked staining wood blue or green for whatever reason and if it was a curbside find and I messed it up, so what. It was a cheap hobby to rescue curbside finds and try to turn it into something useful to us.

I had several Frankensteinian experiments where I combined pieces from dead furniture or whatever and it was never good enough to, say, start a furniture business but served MY needs affordably.

I turned a square end table upside down and put wheels on it and added a tabletop bought at Home Depot or whatever and stained it blue. I made the top off center so it hung over on one end so I had a desk on wheels with storage that worked when I sat on my loveseat.

I was dog sick and getting divorced, so it was funky but helped me be productive under circumstances where that was challenging.

In the same room, I had a chest of drawers I turned upside down and put legs from an old desk on it and painted it green and covered the drawer fronts with blue and green shiny maybe fleur de lis or similar upholstery material and white knobs and the new ""top"" section was weird. The bottom drawer was missing or damaged maybe and I made some jury rigged solution and I was never happy with that part of the piece but I overall loved that piece.

I had both those pieces and a blue sleeper loveseat in the dining room while getting divorced and moving my stuff out of the bedroom and his stuff into the bedroom to begin separating our lives under difficult circumstances.

I hung pale green sheets on two walls to separate the space from the kitchen and dining room and get a little privacy.

It was like having a tent. It reminded me of things in movies about the Middle East.

It was all Frankensteinian experiments and done cheaply and it was the first space that was really mine in my entire life and more feminine than anything I had ever had before without being frilly.

I loved that space even though I also kind of was embarrassed by every stupid thing in it.

When my kids were little, a lot of my furniture was floor models bought at discount and already scratched up so I wouldn't have a fit when the kids put new scratches on it.

The end table I turned upside down had been a floor model. I loved that piece and it matched NOTHING else I ever owned. It had a pink cast to it and my coffee table was more of a yellow blonde wood with glass inserts.

Pro tip: Don't buy a fancy coffee table with a zillion glass inserts. It's a huge pain to pull the glass out and clean it regularly.

But it looked fantastic and had also been a floor model bought at discount.

I would only use upholstery material on drawer fronts again if I could find a method for sealing it with shellac. I think it's not clean enough to just cover wood furniture with upholstery material.

But I LOVED that piece even though it was never quite finished looking.

I think the bottom drawer (new top section) was broken and I put the drawer front on hinges and the top never quite looked right. The other drawers were smaller. That one was the width of the piece.

But if I could solve some of the things I never solved with that piece, I would totally do it again. It looked wonderful and made me happy to own it.",1,1738364080.0,CleanHomeDesign,0,1.0,False
