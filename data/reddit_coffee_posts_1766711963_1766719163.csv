Customers are using Google Maps, voice search, and mobile searches more than ever. That’s where **local SEO** steps in — and it can seriously change the game for your business.

Local SEO helps make sure your business shows up when people nearby are searching for what you offer. Whether it’s “best coffee shop near me” or “emergency plumber in Palm Beach Gardens,” a strong local SEO strategy puts your name in front of those ready-to-buy customers. And it’s not just about online visibility — it actually drives more phone calls and walk-in traffic directly to your door.

Here’s why it works:  
🔹 **Google prioritizes local results.** If someone searches for a product or service, they’re going to see local businesses first — especially those with optimized listings and strong local signals.  
🔹 **Online reviews and listings drive trust.** A complete Google Business Profile with accurate info, photos, and reviews builds confidence. That makes people more likely to pick up the phone or visit.  
🔹 **Mobile search is king.** Most people search on their phones, often when they’re already out. A strong local SEO presence helps you appear right when they need you.

Businesses in Palm Beach Gardens are seeing real results from this. From restaurants and salons to HVAC and real estate services, local visibility is boosting foot traffic like never before.

The power of **local SEO services Palm Beach Gardens** lies in how tailored the strategy can be. It's not just about stuffing keywords or chasing links — it’s about creating local relevance. That includes optimizing your Google Business Profile, managing local citations, using geo-targeted content, and earning local backlinks. All of these factors help you get found by the people already looking for what you offer.

And the best part? It’s a long-term investment. Unlike paid ads that stop once your budget runs out, local SEO builds over time and keeps delivering results.

If you want more calls, more walk-ins, and more real local customers, focusing on local SEO is hands-down one of the smartest moves you can make.",1,1766718931.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

1pvtywg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1pvtywg/the_real_reason_youre_emotionally_drifting_apart/,The real reason you're emotionally drifting apart (and how to fix it fast),"Lately, it feels like so many people are “fine” on the surface but secretly feeling weirdly empty in their relationships. Romantically. Socially. Even at work.

Like you’re there… but not *really* there.

You go through the motions, but the spark is gone. It’s not burnout. It’s something softer, harder to name. More people than ever are quietly drifting from people they once felt close to, and it’s happening way more than we think.

After doing deep dives into this (books, podcasts, psych research), the cause became clear. No, it’s not your attachment style or communication habits (though those can matter later).

**The #1 sign you’re emotionally drifting is this:**  
**You’ve stopped sharing small emotional data with each other.**

Seems simple, but it’s a research-backed warning signal. And the good news? There are *fast, science-based ways to reverse it*. Not fluffy IG “communication tips” or shallow TikToks. These come from serious relationship researchers, clinical psychologists, and behavioral scientists.

Let’s get into the actual fixes.

---

## 1. Share Micro-Emotions, Not Just Major Updates

In *The Love Prescription*, Drs. John and Julie Gottman highlight something called **“bids for connection.”** These are tiny, everyday moments when you reach out emotionally, like complaining about your commute or celebrating a small win.

Emotional drift happens when these moments go unnoticed or ignored.

If your partner or friend says,  
> “Ugh, today was rough,”  

and you just nod or scroll past, that’s a missed bid. The more bids we miss, the less connected we feel.

**Fix:**  
Look for and *respond* to even the “boring” emotions.  
Say things like:
- “Tell me more.”
- “Ugh, that sucks. What happened?”

It’s the quickest shortcut back to closeness.

---

## 2. Start Ritualized Check-Ins, Not Deep Talks

One of the best low-pressure connection hacks shared by Dr. Alexandra Solomon on the *Reimagining Love* podcast is **ritualized check-ins**.

Not dramatic “we need to talk” conversations. Just consistent, small moments.

Examples:
- A 10-minute, no-phone coffee debrief every Sunday.
- A daily question like:  
  *“What’s one good thing or one hard thing that happened today?”*

These rituals rebuild emotional safety.

A 2021 study published in *The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that **shared routines were one of the strongest predictors of long-term relationship satisfaction**, even more than compatibility.

---

## 3. Rebuild Through Shared Novelty, Not Forced Intimacy

When connections dull, many people try to fix it by “talking it out.” But if the emotional foundation is shaky, that can backfire.

Behavioral scientist Arthur Aron’s classic research found that couples who did **novel activities together** reported higher relationship satisfaction than those who just talked more.

Our brains bond through *newness*.

**Try:**
- Taking a class together
- Cooking a weird meal
- Going on a 30-minute, no-phones-allowed walk

It works faster than awkward heart-to-hearts.

---

## 4. It’s Not Always About Love. It’s About Maintenance.

Esther Perel puts it simply:

> “Love is not a permanent state of enthusiasm. It’s a verb.”

Emotional drifting often tricks us into thinking we’re “falling out of love” or “losing interest.”

You’re probably not.

You’re just not tending to the thread that keeps people intertwined:  
**shared emotional presence.**

It’s like dental floss. You don’t notice its power until you’re dealing with the damage of *not* doing it.

---

## Final Thought

This emotional disconnect isn’t your fault.

Our culture obsesses over big talks and dramatic breakthroughs, but ignores the tiny dailies that actually hold bonds together.

You don’t need hours of therapy or a perfect relationship dynamic to reconnect.

Just start with **one micro-response today**.

I get drained by running into people from high school who never really left, plus the obligatory small talk with cousins you see once every few years. So I figured, why not see who else is navigating similar holiday vibes?

I don’t come into this subreddit with big expectations. I’ve met some cool great people here, but seems like sparks fade just as quickly as they show up. That said, I do believe in good conversation, mutual curiosity, and letting things unfold naturally. Shared interests matter to me, and I do ask that you’re comfortable exchanging photos early on. Bonus points if you’re someone who actually initiates because that always stands out.

A little about me:  
I’m 5'2"", travel quite a bit for work, so flexibility is important. I love all things spooky, tarot, astrology, and the cosmos. Big fan of hiking, long walks around the lake, and anything involving water. Coffee is a core personality trait at this point and my dogs are my fur babies. My humor leans incredibly sarcastic and playful, so I’m looking for a man who can keep up with banter and match energy without taking himself too seriously.

If you made it this far, congrats! Your prize is [a photo of me](https://i.postimg.cc/dt0g4tC8/RT-Dec.jpg). To show me you actually read this, send one back. Please don’t hit me with the “I’ll send one after you accept the chat” line because that’s not my vibe. Authentic, upfront energy only!

1pvtw8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pvtw8m/aitah_for_no_longer_wanting_to_be_friends_with_my/,AITAH for no longer wanting to be friends with my best friend because she in unable to respect my time?,"I 21 F and my best friend Sara 21 F met during high school from grade 10-12 and we only became friends post Covid senior year. I was a part of a bigger friend group that included a few girls think 6 girls then I was number 7. Yes it was ass because I ended up walking alone at graduation whilst everyone else was in pairs but it’s fine, live laugh love. 

Background on that friend group I don’t talk to any of them besides two girls Sara and my other best friend Suzan. I had a falling out with one with other girls almost two years ago and I was never that close with the rest so yeah (leaving this one friend was not easy because I stayed days not being able to sleep and overthinking so much) and I also did question if maybe I hadn’t done enough but I had given up on that friendship entirely. 

Moving onto Sara we really only started to get close after we graduated high school, and now at 21 we barely see each other because of life and shit which is normal and I am usually okay with just keeping up with people via social media because I get busy with uni and seeing people frequently unless at my campus is very hard (we go to separate universities btw) 

now I have this issue with her she is usually very late to things like late late. We will agree to meet up at 7 she will show up at 8:30 and she makes it out to be like it’s normal to be fair everyone in her family and friends are like this so I do understand that it isn’t intentional I guess, this was not an easy thing to accept as not only are my family pretty strict when it comes to what time I hang out with my friends, (curfew) because I do live at home but also as I mentioned I usually do not have time, so when I reach out asking to set up a day for us to have fun or even just dinner/ coffee then I really do care about that person. 

I brought it up to her a few months ago that yk I really don’t want her to be late to stuff and that she knows my parents and I really do not like having to wait in the car for 20 minutes outside of her door even though I had said that I had arrived 10-15 minutes prior meaning she was ok with letting me wait that long 30-45 minutes in theory (yes I would lie so she would come out “earlier” never worked btw) anyhow when talking to her about how this upset me as she said that oh yes I know that you are sensitive about time, SENSITIVE really?? No I just don’t want to make plans then have to call you to wake you up like wtf.

 My current issue, I had made plans with her a few weeks ago to meet up as we hadn’t seen each other in months (I had some news to tell her that I’m taking a semester abroad and won’t be home for 6 months). Other plans came up for me and since our hangout was meant to be a very light thing where I would pick her up after her exam and we would just eat and chat I was going to postpone it and wanted to call her to let her know, I didn’t get a response called her a few hours later, no response, called her the next day, same thing (I think one or two of those times her phone was off) mind you we were meant to meet up the next day so wtf she never called me back, she would send streaks and stuff and yes it is during finals for her so I do get that it’s stressful but babe you said on that day that you weren’t going to study so we could go out and mind you on the day that we were meant to hang out she never called at all, yes I was gonna postpone but she didn’t know that so wtf. 

I called her again almost a week after no response, I told my other best friend (Jane) and while telling her I was like is she trying to ignore me and I’m just not getting the hint??  And she said that she does think that’s the case. But here’s the thing, me and Sara have been good, like I used to sleep at this girls house after uni for an entire summer then go home, I once had a movie night with her family at 5 am and got burgers so how is this happening. Also based on our last call nothing seemed bad at all yk.

 I called her again for the last time a few days ago and nothing. Today I saw that she was hanging out with my other best friend Suzan (yes with the entire friend group that I no longer am in contact with unless I see them and we just say hi) I am not upset that they are hanging out because I know that they are all really close and are still friends my issue is she clearly has seen my calls, idk maybe I should have texted but no I won’t reach out now as I am meant to travel tomorrow and I don’t want to add stress but this situation is making it hard to enjoy the pre airport activities yk.

I also really did not want to be the person that just leaves town or doesn’t tell people until a day or two before they leave yk. Help can I really save this friendship and am I wrong for not feeling like it? Also wtf can I do to not feel bad and enjoy my time before I travel.

Bought a a 601 series machine from Costco and I liked it very much. I then compared the features of my machine and the Pro (701) model and thought of spending a bit more for the ‘upgrade’ - could not have been more wrong ☹️

\- Grinder issues straight out of the box

\- water/overflow indicator (the orange bob thing) gets stuck (flooded my counter 3 times already) 

\- Grind size suggestions are all over the place (21 for an espresso - come on!! The grounds at that setting look like saw dust)

\- Hopper fits very lose (literally rattles sometimes when grinding beans) - I am using the Lavazza Espresso beans)

\- frequently not able to detect the portafilter.

Never had any of these issues with my 601 (that I returned to Costco when I bought the Pro 701 series). Will be returning this too. 

Called up customer service - but they seemed to be overly keen on getting the return processed rather than providing a solution or offering a warranty replacement.

Insane, I know. ). Needless to say, we’ve been worked to the bone trying to balance between taking care of customers and the cats, but that’s unrelated to what I want to ask today so I’ll get to the point.

So, I’ve decided to focus on taking care of one of the cats while the other is taken care of the other cat to make things a bit simpler, and while I’d like to say that we’re making progress, it’s hard to tell with me being a first-timer at this. I’ve done what I can from the little research I did ( giving treats, playing / taking her out on walks whenever I can, pet sessions and also giving her space as much as possible ) and she’s a lot more active, wanting to run around and explore, as well as not running off whenever I come around to give her pets or to take her on walks. Sometimes she’d even lick my fingers or rub her head against my palm. But then other times she’d claw or bite my legs. Another thing I’ve noticed is that whenever she’s out on a walk she’d meow a lot, almost as if she’s searching for something or some place, but I genuinely cannot tell. 

Apparently she’s pregnant but the owner who adopted her never gave out details regarding that matter ( in fact, the staff team got little to no information at all about the two cats, and despite me asking I never got any answers. ). Perhaps she’s close to labor and is looking for a nice place to have her kittens but that’s just a guess at this point.

So, how do I proceed? Does she not trust me enough yet and I should just keep doing what I’ve been doing? Some help would be very much appreciated here. Thank you all.

What should I do?,"TL;DR: My family didn't want me to get the scale that I actually wanted for Christmas, and I'm not satisfied with the one that I got. What should I do?

Hello everyone, and Merry Christmas to you all as well!

I'm here to vent and get everyone's opinions on what I'm about to share with you.

So basically over the past few months I was doing a ton of research into reliable coffee scales for pour overs. Many times I would find scales within the $60-$80 range that would have major issues like breaking after a few months of use (looking at you Timemore). That being said, I eventually landed on the Fellow Tally Pro, which was retailing for $150 during Black Friday. I approached some family members for this, and they essentially said that they didn't want to spend $150 on a scale. They said that I should get a cheap $20 scale instead. Now, normally I'm pretty frugal with things all things considered. However:

1) I waited all year until Christmas for this, and it was one of a handful of gifts that I asked for.

2) I only approached people who actively told me that this was within their budget range for gifts per person.

3) I love coffee. It is my grounding activity, and I make it literally every single day. I NEED something that I can rely on without worrying that I spent $60 on something that just will not last. Hence, the Fellow Tally.

Instead, every person that I approached just rolled their eyes and didn't try to see why I found this to be important. Eventually, I was able to ask someone to get me a Brewista Smart Scale 3. And while I'm grateful that I have it, it was never what I truly wanted to begin with. I'm considering returning it within the post-Christmas return window and see if I can get the Fellow Tally instead.

However, the Pro is now back to its initial $199 price tag pretty much everywhere, and I would have to shell out another $100+ to get it. Either that, or I could keep the Brewista right now, forgo the $85 that I would receive from returning it, and save up for the Fellow later. I just don't want my mom to have wasted $85 on something that I never really wanted just because someone else mistook a cheaper price tag for providing better value.

Now, this all being said, what would you do if you were in my situation?",0,1766717619.0,pourover,12,0.14,False

most of his friends and familie has given up on the guy.  
he is his own worse enemy. always has a excuse for his issues. but its usually a consequence of his own stubbornness or actions, or lack the latter.  
he's a horder, in bad health, drinks coffee all day, has a house, but no income so welfare checks come from his house value money of you know what i mean, ( he didnt want to settle with the house after his last parent died and his brother might as wel dont exist)  
he fucked up the equalivant of getting food stamps because he dont like the way it goes and is handled in thought/spirit/people/location/taste and ability to carry.  
complains about injuries he sustained but always fucks up his own recovery hence they never go away and they keep ramping up.

this guy is a contradiction to himself.  
the amount of times i confronted him with his logic and the amount of BS he didnt realise he was spitting, he just gets angry... so deep down... he knows. and he is keeping himself in there.  
he is enabling all his own problems. and keeping them there. he does not compromise.  
he always had a big ego, but he had heart.. he still has. whenever someone was in the room who was betterat something he was ... he left with his tail between his legs snarking.  
its been over 10 years.  
everybody is done (trying) to help him.

its nice to chill and hang with one of my best buddy's.  
but most of the time... after 30 min i ask myself... why did i come here? because its very hard to keep a conversation with this guy ( that coming from me says a lot , because we always could understand each other when others didnt. )  
now we cant, and the guy is basicly so run downits kind of sad.  
at the same time... after all this time.  
im done with it.  
i noticed i kept calling his behaviour out loud more and more.  
because each time he just retaliates by trying to deflect with something completely unrelated in hope people back up.  
that dont work on me, and again after a lot of time. i just keep stepping forward in hope to finaly reach him.

but...  
im done.  
he is hopeless.  
his brain is pudding  
you can barely hold a normal conversation if at all.  
he looks, smells, like a hobo, his house is a broken collapsing mess, maybe even a health hazzard.  
and no one is allowed to help because its to mutch for his brain.  
stubborn would be key word here.  
and contradicting himself by saying that he can do it himself and he has to do it himself.  
when confronted with cold hard truth.. ''you cant, because...ect '' he just says some random BS wise man says sentence and then changes the subject 5 times a minute like he always does.  
he asspulls everything.

What can I do?,"I (29M) am in a long term relationship with my gf (29F) and have been together for 4 years, we both love and committed to each other and want to make our relationship works.
The problem is, I like saving and wants to save up for a house while my gf spends money very freely. We each have our own bank account which we use for our personal expenses and shopping, but contribute an equal amount to a common account which I manage for rent, groceries, bills and car. 
Some examples of this situation is below:
I try my best to save money wherever possible, I cook and prepare food for both of us to bring to work so we don't have to eat out. The thing is my gf still buys food out to eat. I have not bought a coffee out for a few years now but she still does it a few times a week.
I cancelled my Spotify and YouTube subscriptions to save money but my gf regularly still sign up for new subscriptions. 
I only my clothes when necessary and only on sale items from Uniqlo, whereas she buys what she likes and from more expensive brands.
When I'm home alone in the summer, I don't use the air conditioning but she will if she's at home.

For context, we are about 70% towards our saving goal but 90% of that is my saving. I also earns about 40% more than her and sometimes feel bad for her so I pay for stuff that she wants to buy. I tell her please don't buy me any gifts because I prefer us to save but she still does for my birthday. 

She says we are not poor so she is allowed to spend money, I don't want to say no because it's still her money at the end of the day. But I think at least with things like eating out and coffee she can go without. 
I have told her this multiple times but to no avail as she does not seem committed as me to our goal. What can I do to make her understand?",2,1766717338.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
1pvtlq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pvtlq4/christmas_sucked_this_year/,Christmas sucked this year.,"My life fell apart and I moved away from the area I lived all my life.

I ended up moving in with a friend and her family because she was going through a rough time and said she could use some help. She is constantly explaining to me how she is basically paycheck to paycheck so I wasn't expecting Christmas gifts from her but honestly, I am still hurt that she didn't get any for me.

I got exactly 3 gifts this year. One from a client down here that got me a Starbucks gift card after I told her Starbucks isn't my favorite. I am not a big fancy coffee drinker. Plain coffee is just fine for me.

The other 2 were from my friend's mother. I didn't really want to come here but my friend insisted that we were family and I should come.

One of the things her mother got me is a blanket in a color I don't like. The other is what looks to be a sugar bowl or something that I suspect came from a Ross or the like. People that know me know that I drink a lot of coffee but also find out pretty quickly that I drink it black, no sugar. So why did she get me what looks like a sugar bowl?

I had to sit there pretending like I enjoyed the gifts while she brought out item after item for her daughter. I get it. It's her prerogative to spoil her actual child. I just wish I felt remembered and really cared about.

I understand a lot of this is just being in a new place around the holidays. But none of that is making me feel any better right now and I can't tell anyone in my life without feeling like I am ruining their holiday.",3,1766717309.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1pvtizp,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1pvtizp/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it, was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described. As a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her from grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface stirred, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects.

I woke up a little earlier from some commotion downstairs; my mother up much, much earlier than she'd usually be, preparing the turkey for the oven. I had an easy morning doing all my usual things like getting and coffee and feeding the pets then once everyone was settled we opened gifts. My parents seemed to like all of what I got them this year. My father was particularly excited about the CD I got him and the fancy pairs of underwear and socks mother got him. Mother is very fond of the bra we got her, the microwave steam cover, the plant propagation hanger, the seeds, etc. Cooper went bad over his new ball which I didn't realize was a giant exercise ball. Peach got a toy that dispenses treats but if I'm being honest, she was more interested in the treats than the playing; I did most of the batting around for her while she feasted on the aftermath.

I myself got a lovely assortment of goodies. The most pleasant surprise was this engraving pen; I had never asked for one or considered having one but not that I have it, my mind is swimming with ideas. It has over 30 diamond bits and even comes with little pieces of wood, plastic, metal, and leather you can practice on. It will be wonderful for book binding. Maybe I'll make engraved paintings on plywood or even learn how to make wooden toys. We'll see. I also got quite a few lovely little things. Highlights would be a whole box of my favorite coffee, tiny jam & peanut butter that I have always loved to spread on crackers, and a box of fancy chocolate. Also, a grow bag for cucumbers with cucumber seeds, some new pants, and a new coat. Darling's gift was a beautiful pen. I made sure to email them my thanks. And like a spoiled little unemployed brat, they also gave me some money. More than I have ever been able to earn on my own. All in all, I am a very lucky old sap.

I again did nothing but try to maintain good spirits too success for the most part. I helped to cook when Mother asked me to but she is a very independent person when it comes to christmas dinner. There were a few moments of tension, entirely from mother. As mothers can do, she on many occasions, particularly during dinner, can let out a viscous cloud of displeasure than spikes my anxiety like nothing else. No one has to have done anything wrong for her to make the guilt a gas chamber. She snapped at me very rudely on a few occasions and I have been careful to keep my tongue.

Lucky us, garbage day is tomorrow so now we are busy cleaning up. Normally we would leave some things like wrapping paper and the turkey bits that no one eats for the day after christmas but we a new garbage schedule rolling out in the new year, tomorrow is the last garbage pick up for two weeks. We really can't afford to sit on out thumbs. So now, I am going to get all my extra and usual chores done before I can settle down with a coffee and my new chocolates. Maybe a cookie too if I am feeling particularly gluttonous. Goodness, am I looking forward to it.

Yours & Mine,

1pvtdn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pvtdn9/asking_a_girl_out/,Asking a girl out,"Just in needing some encouragement and advice.

So there is this cute girl at work: same team but different shift. Anyhow, when I first joined the company - I found her giving me signs: moving her hair back, taking off her hoodie (if you know you know), being overall friendly, asking questions, taking the opportunity to walk with me after work, asking me questions in slack etc. These are very obvious signs I picked up but promptly ignored them. But after some months, whether that is due to the shift - I havent received anything else from her. At the same time, she has kinda been growing on me. But by this point, I assume she lost interest.

But let me know, maybe these are not signs and just her being friendly. I do remember receiving attention from women still in school which I only realized much much later which was too late. Even at work, I have been receiving again, what I call signs from this other girl but ignored them too.

Anyway, maybe I'm just reading way too much into this and am completely wrong so I appreciate outside perspective. Another thing to note, I never had any kind of romantic relationships so I am clueless in all of this. I have only flirted once with this other girl, which to my surprise came naturally but then we split off.

Back to this girl, I was thinking of inviting her for coffee after work. I was thinking of saying something in the line of ""Hey, would you be down to get some coffee sometime after work?"" and her my phone number on a piece of paper. Does this work, or is there another maybe more casual way to invite her?

And I do know the saying Dont shit where you eat but am still looking for some thoughtful advice, or maybe this is just a bad idea alltogether?

All of my gifts have been more targeted towards family use like new pots and pans, coffee maker, meat thermometer, Clothes that dont fit me so they go to my mother, waffle maker and box mix sweets like brownie and cookie types i dont even like.
This year my mom asked if I wanted money instead of gifts and I said absolutely. Instead I got a new coffee maker the exact one my mom had been thinking about buying for herself for months and coffee items like that mixing thing that vibrates. No money no other gift just that. And sure im used to it i thought I would be fine but when I opened a gift from my sister and her wife it was a ceramic frog and frog themed shirts. I love frogs they are my favorite animal. I dont know why but it broke me finally getting something that's for my enjoyment and not something that was for the family or my mom it just felt so weird nice but weird. 

I know it sounds stupid or like im ungrateful for what my mother has bought me but its hard to be thankful for something you never wanted especially knowing its not really for me.

1pvtcb6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvtcb6,"Christmas Day wines, Merry Christmas y'all!","Merry Christmas r/wine, tonight we had an amazing pot roast with carrots and some various other savory sides, so I decided to crack this bottle to enjoy with the family.

Durfort Vivens is in Margaux and is one of the wineries who have massively stepped up their game recently, but the wine in this bottle was before the time they decided to fight for their 2nd growth status with some help from Michel Rolland.

Domaine Ostertag is a Kermit Lynch producer from Alsace who makes some *killer* wines that can sometimes be a little hit and miss, but in the same way as your rental car being a Mercedes because they were all out of Ferraris

**2006 Chateau Durfort-Vivens Rouge, Margaux, Bordeaux**- Decanted for about 2 hours, the first notes to really hit me were blackberry jam, old oak staves that had been outside in the rain for a long time, blueberry and some dark cherry.

On the palate, you had blackberry, black mulberry, blueberry, dark cherry jam, leather, oak, black potting soil, and a wave of smooth tannins. Though present on the finish, they weren't overpowering/the star of the show like in other reds like Barolo. 

The lack of work from the pre-Rolland era is definitely present here, though that's not to say there are any flaws, this is a perfectly enjoyable Margaux that stays to character and ages quite gracefully. 

All in all, this was very well integrated with medium acidity, medium body, and paired very well with pot roast. A solid bottle of Bordeaux and well appreciated addition to dinner.

An enjoyable well made Bordeaux at an enjoyable age at an enjoyable price; yet another bottle that proves you don't need the best of the best to have a good glass of wine. 



**2018 Domaine Ostertag Fronholz Gewurztraminer Vendanges Tardives, Alsace, France**- For dessert, a wine I had totally forgotten about in a walkin cooler about 3 months ago. I expected it to be showing some signs of being flawed but NOPE, still incredibly alive and well.

On the nose, this shows off the beauty of Gewurztraminer. Elegant white flowers, acacia honey, lychee, Bosch and asian pear, and nectarine zest with delicate hints of cinnamon and fresh ground cardamom like for Turkish coffee. 

On the palate you first get hit with a wall of candied fruits, most notably apricot, but overripe peach, poached pear, and even this hint of cinnamon hit you like a truck. The acidity seems to have gone down since I first had it several months ago which, yeah, fair play to the wine; you were in the grocery walkin for most of the fall. 

The sweetness hits you and that's when you first notice the honey. Holding back from the initial blast of flavors, the honey waits until after the fruits to step out because it evolves through the mid-palette into the full honey flavor compete with acacia flowers that are so incredibly perfumey.

Singing on their own, the flowery and honey notes pick up an incredibly strong undertone of lychee/fruit cocktail syrup, which sticks around until the when it gradually fades into cinnamon, while the flowers and honey slowly morph together into this Chanel No. 5 air of sweet, perfumey, and just a touch bitter. 

Great bottle, but definitely not one for the person who wants a dessert level wine with very little acidity to match the brix, or who isn't interested in quite a lot of delicious fruit and white flower perfumes.

This from the man who had a double VCR hooked up to each of three TVs we had at home in 1982. I remember renting The Empire Strikes Back from Radio Shack in 1984 as soon as it came out. This was before video stores were on every corner and we needed to leave a $100 deposit as collateral so the movie would be returned. We were able to record the movie, and many, many others, on our double VCR. 

He also had the stereo system in our dining room wired throughout the entire house so each room had its own speaker that could be individually turned on, room by room. We had two phone lines; one number for our parents and another number for the kids. We could merge three way calls in middle school. 

We had a computer at home before we had them at school. We had a van with a TV/VCR plugged into the cigarette lighter in 1990.  In 1993 for Christmas he bought me a portable, fold up Brother Word Processor that looked and worked like a laptop. I was doing my college homework in coffee shops  ten years before the business world was.

1pvtb14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pvtb14/magnesium_has_truly_helped_improve_my_anxiety/,Magnesium has truly helped improve my anxiety.,"I didn’t even find magnesium on purpose. One night, after yet another anxious, half-sleepless evening, I was scrolling through Reddit, hopping between threads about insomnia and anxiety. People kept casually mentioning magnesium — not as a miracle cure, but saying things like “it helps me calm down” or “my body finally relaxes.” At first I ignored it, but seeing it pop up again and again made me curious.

I had already tried so many things before — meditation, breathing exercises, cutting out coffee completely, herbal teas, even ashwagandha (which actually made me feel more wired). Nothing really touched that constant, background anxiety: tight chest, racing thoughts, tense muscles for no reason.

So I decided to try magnesium. I started with magnesium glycinate, about 400 mg in the evening. Honestly, after a week, I felt nothing. My anxiety was still there, sleep was still light. I was about to give up when I stumbled on a Reddit comment recommending FineMagTotal — a capsule that combines seven types of magnesium in one. People claimed it worked better than single-form magnesium for relaxation and anxiety.

I gave it a shot, taking 500 mg every evening, and also added a bit of iron and colostrum — just to support my body after months of stress and poor sleep. Around day 10–14, I started noticing subtle changes. My body felt calmer, my heart wasn’t racing as much, and I didn’t feel that constant “on edge” sensation. After 3–4 weeks, the calm became more consistent. Social situations didn’t trigger panic as easily, and my sleep improved naturally.

It wasn’t instant, and it wasn’t magic, but after a couple of months, magnesium combined with iron and colostrum — helped my body relax first, and my mind finally followed. Looking back, it’s funny that a random Reddit thread led me to something that genuinely changed how I handled anxiety.",2,1766716380.0,Anxiety,6,0.63,False

Been working in rail for over a decade now and the amount of injuries and accidents I’ve seen happen during the holidays is pretty crazy. Stay focused while you’re at work, whether it’s slow or not and whether you have people at home who depend on you or if you’re single.

Tagging on with the whole taking care of yourselves thing: I know it’s pretty much meta at this point for you fellow night shifters to be downing energy drinks and eating gas station food every night because it’s convenient or cool or whatever else you wanna tell yourself… you guys gotta cut that shit out. 

Start taking better care of yourself and don’t wait. Just start tomorrow. Switch to tea or coffee. Cook up some food at home, doesn’t have to be anything crazy there are tons of simple recipes out there, just be an adult. 

This is coming from a 36yo dude who has either lost of a lot of friends in the last 5 years from total negligence in their health thinking they’re invincible, or seen my own health decline based on diet and routines based off night shift lifestyle. This shouldn’t be happening, not for decades, but you’re expediting these problems based on your own choices.

I'm 19F and my sister is 31F with three kids (7M, 5F, 3M). Ever since I graduated high school last year she's been asking me to watch them every single weekend. At first I said yes because I love my nieces and nephew but it's gotten ridiculous.

She drops them off Friday night and picks them up Sunday evening. That's literally my whole weekend gone. I had to quit my weekend job at the coffee shop because of this. When I told her I needed the money she said ""family doesn't charge family"" and my mom agreed with her!

Last weekend I said no because my friends invited me to go to the beach. My sister called me selfish and said I was ""abandoning"" her kids. She told our whole family I was being immature and now my aunts are texting me about responsibility.

But like... their not my kids? I didn't choose to have children at 24. She did. And she makes good money as a nurse so it's not like she can't afford a real babysitter.

1pvt5vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pvt5vb/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it, was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described. As a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her from grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface stirred, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/[r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/)TheCrypticCompendium. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration.

Dad has diabetes, mom has Crohns & none of them really eat super spicy stuff anymore but my brother will eat anything so I'm trying to include stuff everyone will enjoy with maybe a couple special items for each of them. With that in mind ~

I've seen posts for candy & for hot chocolate or coffee on here as separate posts & some of them I've definitely shopped (Happy Mug is amazing & I just got some lollies from Leah & chocolate from Pedal Chocolate). Currently I'm trying to find some indie places to get stuff from similar to Hickory Farms/Swiss Colony. Whether full gifts baskets like they offer or separately – cured meats & cheeses, condiments, jams. If I have to buy from several & build the basket myself, I don't mind at all (I actually love putting stuff like that together. Charcuterie boards & gift baskets are some of my favorite things to do). 

I know of at least one shop that does jams/jellies & a couple for chocolates. Mostly, I'm having a hard time finding indie businesses that do shelf stable smoked/cured meats & savory creations to go along with them. 

I am well aware they're not going to get it until after the new year. Most everyone's gifts are late this year for various reasons. But buying small is far more important to me than getting anything right away & everyone I send gifts to knows that. Thanks for any & all recs!

1pvszuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1pvszuz/the_intake_form/,The intake form,"I work nights in the county morgue because the dead are easier than the living.

The dead don’t stare too long.

They don’t ask questions.

They don’t notice when your hands shake.

At least, that’s what I used to believe.

Every body that comes through intake gets a form. Name if we have it. Age. Cause of death. Condition. Time of arrival. Time of refrigeration. Time of autopsy.

Time matters here. It’s how we keep order. It’s how we pretend things end.

On my first night alone, my supervisor warned me not to skip steps.

“Never rush intake,” he said. “Bodies remember when you rush.”

I laughed. He didn’t.

The first month passed quietly. Too quietly. The kind of quiet that settles into your bones. The hum of the refrigeration units became my metronome. The smell of antiseptic clung to my hair no matter how much I washed it.

Then I noticed the intake forms were changing.

Not all of them. Just one.

A John Doe came in from a construction site accident. Crushed chest. Facial trauma. Unrecognizable. I filled out his form carefully, slid it into the plastic sleeve, and placed it on the clipboard outside Cold Storage A.

When I checked it again an hour later, a new line had been added.

Time of movement: 01:17 AM

My handwriting.

I stared at it for a long time. Then I checked the cameras. No movement. No alarms. No door logs.

I crossed it out and initialed the correction.

The next night, the same thing happened.

Different body. Elderly woman. Natural causes. Peaceful expression. Her intake form read:

Time of movement: 02:04 AM

Observed by: Me

I didn’t remember writing it.

I told myself I was tired. I started drinking more coffee. I started triple-checking every form before filing it.

That’s when the bodies started shifting.

Nothing dramatic. A finger slightly bent that hadn’t been before. A jaw no longer slack. A head angled a few degrees toward the door.

Always toward the door.

I stopped listening to music. I needed to hear if something actually moved. The silence pressed in harder without the distraction, and the building started making new sounds—soft clicks, low groans, the whisper of metal contracting in the cold.

One night, while transferring a body from gurney to table, I felt breath against my wrist.

Warm.

I jerked back so hard I knocked over the tray of instruments. The body didn’t move. Her chest didn’t rise. Her lips were sealed shut.

But my wrist was damp.

I scrubbed my hands until the skin split.

The intake forms escalated after that.

New sections appeared. Not typed. Not printed. Written.

Position adjusted for comfort.

Pressure applied.

Subject aware.

I reported it. Management blamed a glitch in the digital system. Told me to stop hand-writing notes and stick to templates.

I did.

The forms kept changing anyway.

On the third week, I found my own name pre-filled at the top of a blank intake sheet.

No body had arrived.

I should have quit.

Instead, I did what morgue workers always do—I stayed, because routine feels safer than the unknown.

The night everything went wrong, we were understaffed. A storm had knocked out power in half the county, and emergency generators were running at minimal capacity. Cold Storage B—the old unit—was back online.

I hated Cold Storage B.

The temperature never held steady. The doors stuck. The drawers slid too easily, like they wanted to open.

A body arrived just before midnight. Female. Late twenties. Cause of death listed as “pending.”

No trauma. No explanation.

Her eyes were open.

I closed them before I realized what I was doing.

Her skin was cold but pliable, like she hadn’t been refrigerated long enough. When I lifted her arm to place the ID band, her muscles resisted slightly.

I whispered, “No,” like that might make it untrue.

I completed the intake form.

When I reached Time of movement, the pen slipped from my fingers.

The words were already there.

In progress.

The lights flickered.

From Cold Storage B came the sound of drawers opening.

One by one.

Metal sliding on metal.

I backed toward the door, heart pounding, flashlight shaking in my hand. The sound grew faster, frantic, like breathing.

Then I felt hands on my shoulders.

Cold. Firm.

They pushed me forward.

I fell hard onto the concrete floor. My chin split open on impact, teeth clacking painfully. Blood flooded my mouth, metallic and thick.

They dragged me by my ankles.

I clawed at the floor, nails snapping, skin tearing. My screams echoed uselessly off the walls.

Cold Storage B swallowed me whole.

Inside, every drawer was open.

Bodies stared back at me—eyes wide, mouths stretched, hands reaching. Their fingers dug into my legs, my arms, my throat. Nails tore through fabric and skin alike.

They lifted me.

They measured me.

I felt my arms being folded over my abdomen. Felt my legs straightened. Felt pressure at my throat, fingers pressing just hard enough to bruise but not break.

A woman leaned over me.

The one with no cause of death.

Her eyes were open now.

“You skipped a step,” she said.

The drawer slid closed around me.

The cold was instant and absolute. My lungs seized. My skin burned. Panic exploded through my chest as I slammed my fists against the metal above me.

The drawer didn’t move.

I screamed until my voice cracked.

When the drawer finally opened, light flooded in.

I gasped, sobbing, choking on cold air.

I was on the floor again.

Alone.

My intake form lay beside me.

Condition: Alive

Cause: Pending

Time of movement: Ongoing

I don’t work there anymore.

The scars on my wrists never healed right. Neither did the bruises on my throat. Doctors said they looked like restraint injuries. Self-inflicted, maybe.

Sometimes I wake up unable to move, convinced my arms are folded, my body measured.

And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I hear drawers opening.

Before the rain, there were meetings.

** 1. The Decision **

After millennia of poor moral performance, Heaven convened an emergency board.

Engagement with core mission (“Glorify God”) was statistically negligible.

God sighed.

“We’ll start over.”

The HR liaison hesitated.

“When You say start over…”

“Water,” said God.

A slide appeared: PROJECT FLOOD, GLOBAL RENEWAL INITIATIVE.

Hydrology raised a concern:

“We can’t get the water that high. Mountains exist.”

“Make it happen,” said God.

Minutes note: Action item, review mountain coverage.

Next meeting: Hydrology team absent. Issue resolved.

** 2. Planning & Logistics **

A Global Species Preservation Committee was formed.

Goal: preserve “representative samples.”

Biology objected.

“Two per species collapses the gene pool.”

“See Project Eden,” God replied.

“Worked fine last time.”

Issue closed.

Predators instructed to “fast creatively.”

Fish told they’d “enjoy this one.”

A systems analyst proposed a simpler fix:

“As You’re omnipotent, could we just rewind Earth?”

“We don’t do rollbacks,” God said. “It implies error.”

Minutes: Alternative rejected on theological grounds.

A memo followed:

Purpose: cleanse corruption.

Method: total environmental reset.

Core values: Justice, Mercy, Efficiency.

Note: Mercy to be demonstrated symbolically.

Heaven approved unanimously.

** 3. Communication Strategy **

Comms asked whether humanity should be warned.

“They’ve had centuries,” said God.

HR drafted a memo anyway:

Final Warning: Cataclysm Imminent.

P.S. Boats now outlawed. Will be confiscated immediately (no connection).

God nodded.

“Send promptly.”

Beneath: Method of distribution—TBC.

** 4. Execution Phase **

Noah appointed Project Lead after an eleven-minute search.

Résumé: obedient, sober most days, good with wood.

Specifications: vague, impossible.

Procurement flagged shortages of pitch, gopher-wood, and faith.

Extension requests denied.

“Faith thrives under pressure,” God noted.

Progress reports improved despite no visible progress.

Species list inconsistent.

One entry reads: “Define ‘kind’ before Tuesday.”

To keep things moving, Heaven authorized “minor miracles”:

material duplication, animal autopilot, odor suppression.

Each logged as routine adjustment.

Rain began early. The Ark remained in open beta.

Heaven issued a waiver: “Seaworthy by act of God.”

Unapproved humans attempted rafts.

Reclassified as shadow projects.
Deprecated.

Angels monitoring the deluge raised a new concern.

“Lord, there’s… accumulation.”

“They’ll settle,” said God.

Minutes: Organic debris, defer to post-flood phase.

** 5. Post-Flood Review **

When the waters receded, the Ark grounded successfully.

Ecosystems: gone.

Morale: low.

Departments filed reports:

Environmental Restoration, overwhelmed.

Soul Intake, catastrophic backlog.

Overflow souls were marked Pending.

Lucifer’s division volunteered to host overflow “temporarily.”

Heaven thanked him and moved on.

Cleanup reported global organic residue.

“Call it sediment,” God replied.

Report closed.

Documentation revisited the Final Warning memo.

“Send it now?”

Decision: Action Deferred.

File archived.

Metrics flagged anomaly: Mercy KPI  0%.

Line deleted before publication.

** 6. Closing Note **

God surveyed the quiet planet.

“A new beginning,” He said.

An angel asked,

“Will they be better this time?”

“They’ll remember,” said God.

They didn’t.

Lucifer, watching from below, stirred his coffee.

“Symbolic mercy?”

An angel shrugged.

“Symbolically successful.”

Final Report

Project Flood, Global Renewal Initiative

Outcome: Partial Success

Lessons Learned: None

Next Steps: Commandments

My partner has like 2 drinks twice per year at weddings. I had my phase of binge drinking in my early 20s (a decade ago, never got too out of control) but now, especially since becoming a parent (4yo child) I maybe have 1-2 drink every 1-2 months at a social or work event. I am not comfortable being drunk or even tipsy in front of my child. My husband and I also have a rule that one parent is always completely sober, not even 1 drink even at weddings and such so that we could respond/drive safely in an emergency.

My inlaws drink daily. When he was a teen he recalls being their ""designated driver"" on occasion which is so inappropriate to me. My partner's parents routinely share a bottle of wine in the evening. If they go out for supper they have several drinks. On any special occasion they normalize binge drinking: mimosas in the morning, then Bailey's in coffee, then cocktails or wine etc as the day progresses. Because they are well off they can do it in a way that looks ""classy"" but it is clearly not healthy. They will joke about his siblings in their 40s being hungover the next day which I think it super immature and again normalizes excessive drinking. I think this is especially bizarre in family contexts like Christmas. 

I just want some feedback. Would you be okay with your kids seeing this example of alcohol use? What would you say to them? Is it fair to ask the siblings not to talk joke about hangovers? I get that my family is on the other extreme so I'm not sure what's normal. ",1,1766715313.0,inlaws,2,1.0,False

1pvswhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pvswhl/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it, was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described. As a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her from grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface stirred, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/[r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/)nosleep. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.",3,1766715101.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

1pvskge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkFisher/comments/1pvskge/some_thoughts_on_capitalist_realism/,Some thoughts on Capitalist Realism,"Hey everyone. I've just finished Capitalist Realism a few weeks ago and found it great. Here are few ideas that stuck with me. Sorry for not including quotes, don't have the book with me right now:

• How sterile our thinking is. In my country, at least, the biggest opponent of neoliberalism proposes a kind of return to a Fordist system of strong unions. How possible is it to apply this in a radically different world? Why can't we invent new things? As the book says, truth changes along with reality.

• I thought a lot about a book called ""The Society of the Spectacle"", by french writer Guy Debord. When televisions began appearing in homes, Debord wrote, ""Everything that was once experienced in person is now withdrawn into a representation."" A parallel reading of these authors seems productive and I wonder if Mark Fisher hasn't mentioned him (I'm not familiar with the rest of his work). But speaking of the concept of reality, it's interesting for me to consider that capitalism not only strips cultural objects of their historicity and meaning, or leads us to a state of depressive hedonism or impassivity, but also articulates a world of images and fantasy in which the very concept of reality becomes elusive. We can't think of alternative realities because we can't even see a concrete reality in front of us.

• Perhaps this is a poor interpretation, and it sounds paradoxical knowing Mark Fisher's fate, but what the book left me with most was a sense of optimism. My edition also included an article in which Fisher defended ""the radical chic"", a concept he used to describe that type of left-wing activist who buys Starbucks coffee and has an iPhone. What he was saying is that any alternative we create to oppose capitalism should include a certain form of consumption, or at least that's how I understood it. My reading is that we can't let capitalism colonize our desire for consumption or ""beauty"". I believe that with the technological development we have, we can aspire to a life in which a certain form of consumption is compatible with forms of production and work that respect people's wellbeing. I don't know how, but that's what we should imagine.

When I took the dispatcher position back in my hometown, I didn’t think I would have to deal with the kinds of things I’ve had to deal with today. It is now 4:30 PM Christmas Day as I write this. I’m hoping that I can get this posted before the end of the day so I can warn as many people as possible. You don’t want to be caught unaware of what’s going on right now. 

I am assuming that this is going on everywhere, but I don’t know that for sure right now. Although I am certain that you will agree with my assumption once you have read to the end of this post. Also, please forgive me if I ramble. I am very frantically typing this at the moment, and I may occasionally tangent to relieve stress. I don’t really have time to edit this, and it is a necessary coping mechanism, so deal with it. Please.

For context, I live in a small midwestern town; corn, soy, and grain country. I had just finished college and was experiencing some heavy burnout. I took the job back home, I think, because I needed some newfound sense of direction. Up until that point, I had been following a path laid out for me, not that I hadn’t made my own decisions, but I was making those choices with the eye of others in mind. I didn’t care about that anymore. Local dispatch for my hometown was the first opportunity where I thought I would be helpful, as in helping people, not somebody’s profit margin.

The only problem is I hate cops. I don’t know for certain what the origin of calling them pigs is, but I like to think it has to do with them basically being the state’s clean-up crew. In the sense that pigs served as the mob’s clean-up crew. I ended up taking the job because I knew a few of the cops from when I was a kid, and the sergeant in charge helped me out one time. I thought I could do some good with these personal connections. But now, I don’t know what any single person can do about anything anymore.

My family wasn’t around, so I decided to work Christmas Day at the station. Earlier in the month, it had snowed a ton, but now there was nothing but a thick layer of mist that made everything it touched wet. I hate 100% humidity. It makes my whole body sticky and uncomfortable. Regardless, I was inside quickly enough that it didn’t bother me too much. The sergeant, I’ll call him Bill, and his deputy, Greg, were the only two cops on call that day.

“Well, hey there, Nate, I hope you slept well?” Bill spoke with a deep baritone from under a bristly white mustache. 

“Yeah,” I said, evading the question. I began setting up my desk the way I liked it. I had my police mojo computer on my right and my own personal laptop on my left, which I was planning to watch Queen’s Gambit on.

“Good to hear it. Well, I’ll let you get to it. Me and Greg are gonna go get some coffee. So give us a call if anything explodes.” 

I smiled at him. “Will do.” He gave me a nod and walked away. I felt the rumble of their cruiser as it started. 

During this time, I was the only dispatcher on duty for my area, which was large, but didn’t even have one person per square mile on average. So, I was the lonely watchmen. A skeleton crew was normal, as this day was usually pretty uneventful out here, but I was worried about the fog and car accidents. I decided to raid the break room for snacks. On my way back, I passed by the front door for what would’ve been the second time. I was some distance from it down the hall, but as it perceived me, I felt a shiver run through my whole body. A huge deer, shrouded in fog from the bottom of the neck down, was staring through the clear glass of the front door. Staring at me as I held my bags of chips, cookies, and shit. It didn’t move, but its empty black eyes followed me as I receded towards my little office. I threw everything on my desk, then peeked back down the hall. It was gone.

“What the fuck,” I spat it out as if just then realising what happened. It didn’t look alive, closer to a taxidermied trophy.  

Any thinking I could’ve done was interrupted by a 911 call. I quickly sat at my desk, took a deep breath, and picked it up. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“It’s Earl!” I recognized the voice on the other end.

“Margaret? It’s Nate. Is Earl having another heart attack?” As I spoke, I entered her address and held the mouse over the button that would dispatch an ambulance. 

“Oh, Nate! Yes, he’s… he’s.  OH MY GOD!” I dispatched the ambulance, emphasizing emergency.

“Margaret? Are you okay?”

“He’s dead, he’s dead.”

“It’s okay, Mrs. Adler. The ambulance is already on its way, they’re gonna help him.”

“No, I…I felt his pulse go.” She started crying. 

I radioed Bill, muting the call. “Bill, I just sent an ambulance to the Adler residence. It’s not looking good, so you might want to head over.”

“Roger that.”

I heard Margaret wheezing and moving quickly, then the slam of a door, followed by more crying. “I can’t believe he’s dead. Oh my god, he’s dead.”

“Margaret, Bill’s gonna be there soon, okay?”

“Okay,” she said. Then an almost thunderous knocking.

“Margaret? Is everything okay?” 

I looked over at the GPS map. Bill was eight minutes away. The ambulance was four minutes away. Margaret gave nothing in reply other than a short intake of breath. I heard a doorknob twist and creak. Then a frantic movement and a click. She locked it.

“Margaret, was anyone else in the house with you?”

“No,” she whispered. “I had my finger on his pulse the whole time. That is not my husband.”

“Margaret? Why’d you lock me out?” It sounded like him. I have since googled Lazarus Sydrome but at the time, I assumed this was impossible, which it might as well have been. Regardless, the real thing that scared me was that Margaret didn’t trust it. In this situation, she should be in denial of his death, not of his life. 

“Don’t open the door,” I said. “The ambulance is three minutes away.”

“Margaret! Please! I’ve been to the other side, I can tell you! I can tell! I can tell! I can tell you! Margaret!” I heard a loud bang against the door. “That’s okay. You’ll find out soon enough anyways.” I heard muffled receding footsteps. Time passed in silence. I heard a more distant knock after the paramedics arrived. Then she hung up. I sat there for a moment. I don’t know how long. Another call came in. I answered.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Um… my-my name is Eddy.” The voice sounded like a young boy’s

“Okay, Eddy, what’s going on?”

“Um…a car hit us. Really hard.”

“Do you know where you are?”

“No, it hit on my mom’s side. She’s not moving.” I heard him start to cry.

“Is the driver of the other car still there?”

“He flew.”

“What do you mean?”

“He wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He hit our car too.” 

I almost said “fuck me” out loud. This was not at all the stress level I was anticipating for the day.

“Who’s on the phone!?” I heard a man’s voice yell.

“Is that him?” He sounded fine. Then I remembered the last call.

“Yeah.”

""Did you call the fucking cops, little shit?""

""Eddy! I'm stuck."" A woman's voice. Eddy, are you okay!? I can't see you!""

“Eddy, run down the street until you find a street sign okay?” I heard no response. “Eddy?” somebody hung up. “FUCK!!” I yelled. I was beginning to panic. I felt my chest tighten, and I began to cry as I spiraled down thoughts of uselessness. “What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?” I repeated to myself over and over again. Then I wrote this. I’ll let you know if anything else happens out here.



Thank you for reading 

Even though there’s nothing you can do

  


7 PM

Bill and Greg returned to the station sometime after that and found me in my office with my head in my arms.

“You okay there, Nate?” I looked up into his eyes. He looked tired. 

“Yeah, what happened to Margaret?” He sighed and thought for a moment. Instead of responding, he waved his arm and walked away. I rolled myself and my chair into the hall. “What do we do now?” I asked. The phone rang, and I went back into the office. Bill started walking back towards me. I picked up.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at Skeeter’s Pub, and there’s a guy with a gun.”

“Okay, is he threatening people with it?”

“Not yet, but him and this guy keep getting at it with each other. They got here before me, so I think they’re both drunk.”

“Alright, a coupleof  officers are on the way.” 

I muted myself as she said, “Thank you.”

“Armed drunkard at Skeeter’s pub,” I looked at Bill. I’d never seen him scared like that before.

“Goddamnit, Greg, let’s go. Stay on the phone and keep us updated, Nate!” They left. 

“Ma’am, can you get yourself out of the pub?”

“Not without moving past them, I’d rather just stay here.”

“Fuck you!” I heard from a distance. Then a loud pop followed by lots of screaming.

“Oh my god, he shot him,” she was whispering now. “No, wait, did he miss?”

“No way,” I heard another voice. “I saw it go straight through his head.”

“What the fuck? He’s getting back up.”

“The man who was shot?” I asked.

“Yeah, he got shot in the head and just got back up. The other guy doesn’t know what to do.” I heard several more gunshots. 

“AHHHH!” A scream followed by a repetitive banging.

“Holy shit, he’s just smashing his face on the bar.”

“FREEZE!” I heard Bill yell. Something wet slid and then dropped onto the floor.

“I think the other guy is dead.” A wet gurgle and a fit of coughing followed. “Uh…I uh…”

“What’s happening?”

“He… got back up. What the fuck!? He got back up like it was nothing!?”

Pandemonium and several more gunshots followed before I lost connection. 

Am I anything but an observer?

Do I have the power to change things?

1pvsgqs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvsgqs,"Furniture placement in tiny living room, want to de-emphasize the tv as center of our life","Like the title says, I’m tired of the tv being the center of our world, and I think our design is encouraging it to be a major focus. Instead I want either the fireplace / a coffee table to take center stage. 

My husband doesn’t want to downsize the tv which I respect, but he said he’s open to moving it around a bit. 

The issue is that the living room is pretty small and it’s a transitory space; it also functions as the front door, the portal to the kitchen, and the portal to the worlds longest narrowest hallway leading to the bedrooms. 

I’m including photos across the last couple of years we’ve owned the house including when it was new and empty and beige af. We’ve swapped the big striped couch for a super deep oversized chair which initially I wanted to put across from the fireplace til I realized it’s way too deep haha. Last two photos kinda show the view from the kitchen which includes a pony wall adjacent to the front door. I’m 99% sure it’s  structural, plus we’ve got a booth in there now, so it’s staying haha. 

The room is approximately 15 ft (fireplace wall) by 11 ft, but that 11 ft includes the front door / kitchen / hallway area. 

Things I’m considering: moving the tv down and to the right towards the bookshelf wall, then putting a large / tall bright piece of art on the left side to draw the eye. Or putting a tapestry over the tv to hide it when not in use. 

For furniture, I’m thinking about putting the green couch / another couch against the wood wall facing inwards, positioning the white oversized chair-sofa diagonal against the bookshelves so it’s facing sort of toward the kitchen, and maybe putting the current record player hutch across from the fireplace to separate the “entryway” from the living room, and getting a smaller round coffee table. 

But I also don’t really have a clue what I’m doing which is why I need some help haha. 

Open to ditching long couch for a love seat / living chairs, but we have kids and pets so we need a comfy space for them to pile onto me regardless of how many other seats there are. ",1,1766713737.0,DesignMyRoom,3,1.0,False

anyway i picked up my old guitar that was collecting dust in the closet cause i literally had nothing better to do and no one to hang out with anymore. she always said it was annoying when i practiced so i kinda just stopped over the years we were together. started playing again just to fill the silence in my apartment

fast forward to now and im actually getting pretty decent?? like i joined this local open mic thing at a coffee shop in Brooklyn and people have been really supportive. even got asked to play at someone's birthday party next month which is wild. ive got some money aside so im thinking about upgrading my gear soon which feels exciting

but heres the thing that messes with my head. i caught myself thinking yesterday that if we were still together none of this wouldve happened. id probably still be watching her reality shows every night and letting my hobbies die. and i feel guilty for being grateful about something that came from us breaking up?? like im not supposed to admit that losing her led to finding this part of myself again",73,1766713650.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

We ate somewhere in Makati, then she brought me to a bar in Pobla for a bit (I got drunk), and we accidentally met one of her coworkers there pa nga.

I was honestly scared when we smoked because the shit was so strong. It was my first time feeling that, and my senses got too sensitive. It started to overstimulate me, and I could even smell her from afar. So I lent her a new shirt and, ofc, since we were going to sleep on the same bed, I wanted her to be comfy and to smell fresh.

1pvs7dw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvs7dw,December Board Game Advent Calendar!,"Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! This December from the first to today, my girlfriend and I have played a game a day (sometimes more) based on an advent calendar we found online (credit: @ sharondrawsboardgames). I thought I'd give some thoughts on the games we played. So sorry for what will probably be a huge wall of text.

Game to:

1. Celebrate the season - **Fountains**: A unique tile laying game in which you have to create a beautiful flowing fountain full of koi fish, lily pads, and coins. I really like the different shapes and the cool designs of fountains that can come about. We definitely have not explored this game as we only have **1x** play. Not too much to say here. 

2. Lighthearted - **Floristry**: We love Floristry! This is one of our go-to games when we want a short/easy night. It's another tile laying game that is played using an app as a timer. It's strategic enough that we still enjoy it after **12x** plays. 

3. Relaxing game - **Coffee Rush**: This is not a relaxing game at all but the theme of coffee was as close to relaxing as we could get. Coffee Rush is not my favorite, but my gf really likes it. You basically run a coffee shop and collect ingredients to fulfill orders. After every round, any orders that you couldn't complete are moved down one space and if they ever get past the fourth, then you take a loss and after, what I think is four? missed orders, you lose. **4x** plays 

4. Fast paced - **Kites**: Kites is a super simple, real time game. You have six different colored sand timers that you flip over when you play corresponding colored cards. If at any time, any of the timers run out, game over. I've come to really enjoy co-op games and this is one of the simplest. Really easy to play when you want an easy night. **17x** plays. 

5. Special game - **Everdell:** I'm sure most of you know Everdell already. We really want to play more of this game cause it's been so fun every time and the components are so great! **3x** plays.

6. A game we haven't mastered: **New York Zoo**: Not much to say about this. It's been okay but not a game that I'm dying to get on the table. It's got good mechanics, but there's just something that's missing. **2x** plays. 

7. Cooperative - **Sail**: Now this is a game that we got recently and boy it's not as easy as I thought it was gonna be. I'm a sucker for trick taking games and this one does it in a really fun way. You have to move your ship through dangerous waters by winning (or strategically losing) tricks and boy is it fun. We've only won the starter scenario lol. Really really enjoy this game. **3x** plays. 

8. Wintery theme - **Forest Shuffle**: We didn't really have a wintery theme, but the winter cards to end the game were the best we had. Forest Shuffle was one of the first games we got but it's got less and less table time as we go. We have both expansions and sometimes we play with all the cards in and so when I think of this game, I think of the super long games that can sometimes be a drag to think about. I'm sure that if we took the right amount of cards out, it would be a smoother experience. **10x** plays. 

9. Competitive - **Radlands**: Here we go! Radlands is so freaking fun it's insane. The theme, the gameplay, all of it is just so well tuned except Bombardment (we play without it). **4x** plays. 

10. Twinkle brain - **Faraway**: Another really great short game. The scoring system of moving backwards really makes you think about what you're playing and how you're gonna score cards that you play early. The sanctuaries are also so important. They really balanced this well. **8x** plays. 

11. Bluffing - **Agent Avenue**: We literally bought this game just to satisfy this days theme of bluffing. It *is* fun, but honestly it's not what I was expecting. My expectations may have been too high, but we played it a couple times and I already felt like I had a read on my gf and how she bluffs. Not a bad game at all, but again it's not one that I'm rushing to get to the table. **4x** plays. 

12. Pretty components - **Sagrada**: Sagrada is a beautiful game in which you are trying to craft a stained glass window with colored dice. The placement rules are simple yet challenging and the secret/public objectives you have make your own gameplay a little more intense. There is very little player interaction, but we don't really mind that because it goes quick. **6x** plays. 

13. Card driven - **Sea Salt & Paper**: This could very well be one of my top three games of the year. It's so simple but the origami art style is absolutely gorgeous. The gameplay/card effects are very easy to understand which is great for a simple night of gaming. (Realizing we have a lot of 'simple night games'. **9x** plays. 

14. Farming - **Harvest**: This was the second game that we ever played when getting into board games and it still holds a premium spot in my mind. The gameplay itself is super fun, BUT I've kinda found that planting solely pumpkins kinda worms your way to the win every time. We just bought the expansion so we are excited to get back to it. **7x** plays. 

15. Movement based - **Ticket to Ride**: Again, I'm sure most of you know this, I dont think I really have anything new to add. It's my gf's favorite game and I find that it actually plays super smooth at two players though, we don't play mean, we both kinda just finish our routes, no screwing up each others paths. **8x** plays. 

16. Received as a gift - **Azul Duel**: This was a cool game. I don't really remember the original Azul, but the duel version seemed to have strong mechanics. Tbh, I don't remember a ton lol. Will play again. **1x** play. 

17. International setting - **Sky Team**: I think this is my game of the year. They packed so much content into the base game. I'm actually happy that we've lost a good amount of Sky Team. If we were winning every time, it'd get boring but no lol we have definitely crashed some planes. **9x** plays. 

18. Withstands test of time - **Carcassonne**: Another classic that im sure plenty of you know. This could very easily take on Sky Team as best game of the year. We just got the Inns and Cathedrals expansion and it filled in some of the gaps that the base game had with some really great tile additions. **7x** plays. 

19. Filler game - **10 Days in the USA**: This is our most played game of the year at **21x** plays! From the creator of Ticket to Ride, Alan R. Moon, comes a game in which you have to create a ten day trip across the United States by walking, driving and flying to other states. Say it with me now, ""a great game for a simple night."" 

20. Crafting, building or efficiency - **Flamecraft**: Another game that we want to play more, but haven't gotten to the table very much. I don't really have too much to say about it, but there are other games I'd rather play. **2x** plays. 

21. Narrative but we changed it so we could play... - **Critter Kitchen**: We didn't have a legacy game and we wanted to play Critter Kitchen so. Critter Kitchen is a much better Flamecraft. You have to go to different vendors to grab ingredients before rival restaurants take them. You have to build challenge meals while also preparing for the day seven Critic meal. It has great replayability and we want to get it on the table more often. **2x** plays. 

22. Building game - **Bosa**: This game surprised me by how much I liked it. You draft cards turn after turn and build a machine that gives you supplies by either activating cards horizontally or vertically. There's so many great mechanics at work, like patronage, engine building, and goal cards. **2x** plays. (We've played it more with more than two players). 

23. An all-time favorite - **Isle of Night**: This was the very first game that got us into board games. We were at Barnes and Noble and saw this and Harvest and said spontaneously ""We should get into board games."" We purchased them and were completely enamored by how fun they were. Isle of Night, unfortunately, fell off as our collection grew, we played it again for this challenge and it was nostalgic for sure, but not as fun as I remember. **19x** plays. 

24. Unwrap a game - **Toy Battle**: We got this game for Christmas and holy it was fun! A prime example of 'don't judge a game by its box.' I definitely got kiddy vibes from it but even so it is SO FUN. We just got it so we haven't played too much, but I'm dying to play it again. **2x** plays.

1pvs6cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pvs6cr/dual_midrange_grinders_vs_single_high_end_grinder/,Dual midrange grinders vs single high end grinder [$1500],"I’m currently using a Timemore 087s and Eureka Specialita. I have the [finecoar 3D printed dial mod](https://makerworld.com/en/models/199935-finecoar-grind-setting-dial-v2-1-for-eureka-mignon#profileId-220507) for the Specialita and it’s completely leveled up the grinder, making it trivial to dial in. I use the 078s for light to medium roasts and the Specialita for medium to medium-dark. I rarely drink really dark roasts. I think this duo excels at their respective areas and I’m enjoying my espresso. 

I actually also have a Niche Zero in the mix but I don’t really use it anymore since printing the Specialita dial mod; I prefer the taste coming from the Specialita and now the Specialita is as easy to dial in as the Niche Zero.

I also have a Moccamaster and a Baratza Virtuoso+ to accompany it. 

With four grinders sitting on my counter eating up space, I really want to downsize. 

Will any of the higher end grinders (Philos, Atom, Zerno, etc) around $1500 USD (I’m flexible) act as a suitable replacement for the 078s and Specialita in terms of bringing the best out of a range of light to medium-dark roasts? I don’t love the idea of frequently changing burrs, but if it really is easy enough to do so and doesn’t have downsides, I’d consider that approach. 

Bonus points if it’ll also successfully replace the Virtuoso+ as well for drip coffee!",1,1766712815.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

1pvs586,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1pvs586/just_shared_part_of_my_story_at_an_alcathon/,Just shared part of my story at an Alcathon,"I’m still all whoah! So, I’m newly back to sobriety, longest period I ever had was 14 months and that was 3 years ago. I’m currently 101 days sober, living in a halfway house (which is great! We have a cat, couldn’t ask for more.) 

Being Christmas and all my only plans for the day was to attend my local alcathon throughout the day. I went for a few hours earlier this morning and had plans to go this evening with a few of the girls in the house. This was mainly because last week one of the girls kept joking around with how she had just signed XYZ up for something at  the alcathon. I mentioned how I’m available as I wasn’t going anywhere, thinking she was just signing us up for service work like greeter or coffee maker….. NOPE! 

Next thing I know me and my housemate are asked to come to the table to speak and share our stories. I was very taken aback but currently during this journey of my sobriety I have a whole lot of ‘fuck its’ and am putting myself in situations I’ve never been in before. I attend meetings 5-6 days a week and even obtained a sponsor who is pretty rad. 

So I go and sit at the table in front of the crowd and naturally I was chosen to speak first (thanks a lot higher power lol). So I explained I’ve never shared my story before and I’m nervous but here goes. So I went and that was that. 

Afterwards a few people came up to me and said how I did a great job and to keep it up. Definite confidence booster and making me even more excited to be pursuing this path of sobriety.

I hope maybe my little share here helps anyone out there especially on this day. Sending good vibes and high fives.

I(28M) met a girl(21F) at my work gym about a month ago, she works for another company but I would see her almost everyday as it’s a one story office but pretty large. 

We started with small talk, then got each others numbers. She made the first move to go get coffee before work so we went before our shifts and she was throwing hints like she was interested in me. We would meet up a couple times before work but only for like 20min, text all day and then face time when she was home. 

One day I asked her if I can take her too dinner to get to know her more and she threw every excuse not to do even if I had a solution too it. One day we working talking and I asked her why she didn’t want to hang out after work and she said because she’s not ready for a relationship at the moment because she has a lot of family problems and personal problems with school and money and it’s just a lot but she would like to continue to talk because it sucks she met the right guy but wrong timing. 

We continued to talk and last week I was fed up and asked her hey we’re pretty much talking on the phone all day at this point, still going for breakfast, still face timing. You tell your mom about me. We’re pretty much talking like each other and adapting to the slang we use. I need atleast to get to know you in person to actually hang out it doesn’t have to be a date and she told me the same thing. 

To me it’s ok, if she’s going through it I understand. I told her then I can’t wait around as much I would like to talk to her I can’t waste my time and let’s just leave it at that. We hung up and I pulled back a bit, and I was ok never talking again. That didn’t even last a hour when she called me and made it seem like nothing happened (my fault in answering again). When I pull back again she comes back even stronger with calls and texts but still won’t hang out. 

I’m not sure if I have to be more firm and be like hey this has to stop and I’ll rather stop talking since we don’t want the same thing, or just set a boundary and be like we have to stop talking everyday on the phone because that’s a waste of each others time.

1pvs2uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pvs2uf/apps_for_tracking_starttoend_workflow_timing_with/,Apps for tracking start-to-end workflow timing with history.,"I make flat-whites for my wife and myself in the morning before work (3 drinks) and at lunch before getting back to work (2 drinks). My workflow (from start to finishing all my cleanup) needs to be is as fast as possible without sacrificing flavor.

I want to measure the effectiveness of workflow tweaks with a timer app that allows for named activities with history. None of the timer/stopwatch apps I've found satisfy all these requirements, but before I write my own, I wanted to check with r/espresso :)

Requirements are:

* The central UI element is ""Activity"" (examples: ""Morning Flat Whites"", ""Lunch Flat Whites""). Activities have a stream of timer sessions.
* Once an activity exists, starting a timer against it is a single tap.
* Foreground timer sessions prevent screen sleep.
* Tracks to the second.
* Timer history is permanently stored on-device.
* Timer sessions can be tagged (for example ""parallel grind"", ""serial grind"", ""mistake"").
* Visualizations:
   * Time series with adjustable moving average.
   * Session tag histogram.
   * Session tag / duration heat map.

I've looked for timer/stopwatch apps but there's nothing I've found that fits even two of these requirements: Toggl Track, Clockify, Harvest, Timery, Timer+. Stopwatch apps all center elements like laps, and do not support named activities. Coffee timer apps are too domain-specific: They're about shot or grind timing, not overall start-to-cleanup workflow.

1pvs0zh,https://i.redd.it/qkz3j2nuag9g1.jpeg,Banksy Inhibition - the rules,"very 1st thing at the Exhibition?  Rules ! WTF?!

Banksy Rules : re-imagined 

The irony is physically painful. A ""Banksy"" exhibition in Christchurch—likely ""The Art of Banksy"" which is famously unauthorized by the artist himself—plastering a list of bureaucratic, soul-crushing demands at the door is the ultimate middle-finger to the spirit of the work. It’s a gift shop with a ticket price, managed by the very ""Middle Management"" types Banksy spends his life mocking.
Here is the ""Rules"" list rewritten with the bitterness, cruelty, and anti-authoritarian bile it deserves.
WELCOME TO THE CAGE
(OR: HOW TO CONSUME REBEL ART WITHOUT UPSETTING THE DEBTORS)
Congratulations on paying $40 to see art that was originally free on a wall. To ensure you don't accidentally have a genuine thought or feel a spark of anarchy, please adhere to the following Commands:
THE ""DO"" LIST (OBEY)
 * Worship the Hi-Vis: Obey the minimum-wage hall monitors. They are here to ensure you remain a docile, paying unit.
 * Gaze, Don't Graze: Look with your dead eyes only. If you touch the ""subversive"" art, the insurance premium goes up and a billionaire somewhere loses his erection.
 * The A4 Rule: If your bag is larger than a sheet of paper, surrender it. We can’t have you smuggling in anything dangerous—like a can of spray paint or a shred of dignity.
 * Leash Your Spawn: Keep your children under total surveillance. We wouldn't want them to learn that ""breaking things"" is actually how most of this art was made.
 * Snitch: Report any ""damage"" immediately. Collaboration with the authorities is encouraged. Be a good little asset.
THE ""DON’T"" LIST (SURRENDER)
 * No Touching: Do not touch the walls, the frames, or the pedestals. This is a sterile mausoleum for ideas that used to be alive.
 * No Flash: Don't use flash photography. We need to preserve the colors so we can sell you the $60 coffee table book on the way out.
 * No Fuel: No food, no drink, no gum. Starve and dehydrate yourself. Hunger makes you more compliant.
 * No Joy: No running, climbing, or leaning. Stand perfectly still. Become a statue of a consumer.
 * No Identity: Remove your hoods and helmets. We need your face clearly visible on our CCTV so we can cross-reference your data while you look at ""anti-surveillance"" art.
IMPORTANT THREATS
 * We Are Watching: CCTV is in operation. You are being recorded while you admire ""the man who avoids cameras."" The irony is free of charge.
 * The Purge: We reserve the right to kick you out for ""inappropriate behavior."" In this building, ""inappropriate"" means acting like the artist whose name is on the door.
 * Climate Controlled: The environment is carefully controlled to protect the ""Art."" It’s a shame the same effort wasn't put into protecting the neighborhoods these pieces were stolen from.
FINALLY: TAG US. Validate our corporate existence on Instagram. Use the hashtag #TheArtOfBanksyCHCH so we can track your engagement metrics and prove to our shareholders that rebellion is a very profitable commodity.
NOW GET IN THERE, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, AND ENJOY THE RESISTANCE.
Thoughts on the rewrite? Given your spike in BP after ""searching for spectacles"" and ""podcasting,"" I'd be curious to see what your reading was after walking through this bureaucratic nightmare. Would you like me to draft a mock ""Letter to the Editor"" or a scathing review for the exhibition's social media?
