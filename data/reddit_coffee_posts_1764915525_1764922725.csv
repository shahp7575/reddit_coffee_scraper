**Feeling Stiff After 50? 🧘‍♀️ Reclaim Your Mobility in 30 Days (Simple Stretches, Big Results!)**

Hey RetirementReady friends! 👋

Anyone else wake up some mornings feeling like they're auditioning for the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz? 😂 I know I do! That creaky-knee, stiff-back feeling can be a real drag, especially when you're trying to enjoy these golden years. But guess what? It doesn't *have* to be this way.

I've been experimenting lately, and I wanted to share some seriously easy stretches that have made a *huge* difference in how I feel each day. We're talking about things you can do while you're waiting for your coffee to brew!

So, if you're ready to ditch the stiffness and embrace a little more pep in your step, check these out:

*   **Morning Wake-Up Stretch:** Reach for the sky! Seriously, just a simple overhead stretch first thing in the morning can work wonders. Imagine you're pulling down sunshine and energy. Corny? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely!
*   **Chair Yoga Hero:** You don't need to be a contortionist. Gentle twists and forward folds while sitting in a chair are amazing for loosening up your back and hips. YouTube is your friend here; so many easy routines!
*   **Calf Raises While Waiting:** Waiting for the kettle to boil? Do some calf raises! Strengthens your ankles, improves circulation, and it's so sneaky you barely notice you're exercising. Win-win!
*   **Shoulder Rolls & Neck Stretches:** Desk job got you hunched over? These are life savers! Simple shoulder rolls forward and backward, and gentle neck stretches (ear to shoulder, chin to chest) can release so much tension.
*   **Walk it Out:** Just walking around the block counts. It's not a marathon, it's a lifestyle! Even 10-15 minutes can do wonders.

Are these groundbreaking, earth-shattering exercises? Nah. But are they *effective*? Absolutely. The key is consistency. Even a few minutes a day can make a HUGE difference over time.

Remember that feeling when you could bend over and tie your shoes without making a grunt sound? 😉 We can get back to something closer to that!

1pepjn2,https://i.redd.it/e2i3arihfc5g1.jpeg,Can you explain me this thing? [Gaggia Espresso Evolution],"Hallo r/espresso,

I am very new in the espresso game and got myself a Gaggia Espresso Evolution. Fot now it absolutely satisfies my needs, temperature issues and being prone to channeling are not bothering me (at least not yet).

I have yet to invest into a espresso grinder. For now I let my coffee dealer grind my espresso very fine. I prefer losing aroma over having coarse grinded coffee. Coming from years of drinking Bialetti coffee, my taste in coffee is far from what most people here may consider good espresso. It may be too cold or too hot, I don't care for crema or latte, I just like it to be strong. If there is some bitterness I am absolutely fine. 

But I am unsure for a couple of things and it seems like Google does not help me as much in this topic as in others. So please forgive me my stupid questions.

Firstly, what is the use of the pictured plastic thingy? The manual consists only of pictograms, in the longer internet version it is not mentioned. I figured out, it is to be used for (coarse?) pre milled coffee to get a better crema? Can this help me in my quest in getting a stronger espresso, as it elevates the pressure? I am experimenting but as a lot of variables like temperature are out of my control, I would like to understand the theory behind.

Extra question: My machine came with two strainers for one or two cups. I see a lot of people here using an open sieve. Would this help me on my  quest to get an intense coffee? I noticed, there is a lot of open space in my portafilter. If there would be the possibility to add a bigger sieve, to be able to produce more milliliters of coffee before it becomes dirty water, I would be interested. Also the two strainers are clipped in, so using a knock box means losing my strainer in the box. Could I also get away from this by using an open strainer?

Once again, please excuse my stupid questions and poor wording. English is not my mother language and I have no idea about making espresso yet.",2,1764922081.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

At this point the car is another coparent.

At the start of the drive I felt sorry for myself. But something about the snow, Christmas lights, and baby snores just made me so grateful. I am so grateful to have had the car as an option, middle of the night espresso, and most of all a healthy baby.

So, I had to walk home in the icy wind, every step colder than the last. The chill seeped into my bones, and by the time I finally got indoors, I was shivering and exhausted, as if the cold had followed me inside.

This morning, it’s no better. The air feels like it’s holding onto winter a little too tightly, and I’m wrapped in the quiet solitude of my space. Light stretches slowly across the floor, and the world outside is still and frozen. My room smells of wood, incense, and the lingering warmth of a candle I forgot to blow out. There’s a half-finished mug of coffee sitting beside me, steam rising lazily into the cool air, as a record spins softly in the background.

And I’m thinking… there’s nothing quite like the comfort of a hug when the world feels this cold. The kind of warmth that melts the chill in your bones, even if just for a moment. But I’m curious what else brings that sense of comfort? What are the alternatives when a hug isn’t possible?

A friendly chat? A thoughtful gesture? I’m open to ideas, because right now, all I really want is a warm connection to counter the frostiness of the morning.

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

1pephjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1pephjc/need_advice_regarding_a_smear_campaign_on_our_new/,Need advice regarding a smear campaign on our new business.,"Gday Reddit. I want to reach out to everyone here, especially those on hospitality regarding an issue we have with an ex employee and a smear campaign she has started against us. 
Three weeks ago we opened a new restaurant/cafe on the Mornington Peninsula. We hired a few staff to run the front and a chef to cook in the kitchen. The chef was amazing. Talented, creative and could cook up a storm. But it didn't take long for things to get weird. She began turning up and letting herself in at the restaurant at weird hours. One night the cops were called because she was spotted loitering around at 2am. We sat her down and explained to her that she had her set times and she can work within those hours only. She kept the key so she could let herself in at 6am for prep. She then began to bring personal effects into the restaurant. Things like incense bowls and family photos. After another polite chat about boundries, she moved them but kept them in the rear prep area. We kept asking for her bank account details but she didn't give them to us until her first week was done. Then, when she did, they were written on a piece of paper with a list of hours she had 'worked'. 150 hours to be exact. And she wanted $40 per hour for every hour worked!  Once again we talked to her about boundaries and explained that the extra hours worked weren't permitted by me and that we won't pay them. And that she was on the award rate for a Cafe chef at $29.66 for a level 3 which she is. We paid her for 38 hours and the next day she had arrived at 5am, not 6am as explained and had set up the outdoor seating and had cooked nothing. Added to that she had bought her sister in to work the coffee machine without asking me and then, later in the day when I wasnt there payed her sister cash from the till for the two hours she was there before I turned up. I began looking for another chef and through these interviews found out this woman I hired wasnt even qualified, and had began a trial at another establishment. The next day I sat her down and sacked her. I payed her what she was owed and a couple of days later the google reviews started as well as a smear campaign to all the other restaurants in the area. Accusations of unfair work conditions and not paying staff were spread around and our 5 stars have dropped to 3 due to the inundation of negative reviews from both real accounts of her friends and family and a host of new accounts created by her. We have noticed a 7% down turn from last week, and although it could be attributed to black Friday sales and people spending money on Christmas, it cant be overlooked as a possible direct result of her smear campaign. 
So the question is, what can I do to get these reviews removed? Ive reported all of them but nothing has changed. Ive replied to most in the hopes that people will see that its ridiculous that one venue can gain dozens of one star reviews in the matter of a few days. Trust me our cooking is amazing. Can google be contacted directly? Should I delete the restaurants google page? Can I take legal action against her?
Thanks for reading.

How to Write a Friends-to-Lovers Arc: Building Romance from Friendship.

July 11, 2025 by Alex
I’m going to share some thoughts on how to write a friends-to-lovers story. It’s a classic for a reason, right? There’s something so comforting and exciting about seeing two people who already know each other inside and out eventually fall in love. It taps into that idea of finding your perfect match in someone you’ve always had by your side. But making that transition from “just friends” to “madly in love” feel real and earned? That takes some careful thought, not just throwing two characters together and hoping for fireworks.

So, I’ve put together a sort of guide to help us think through how to build that genuinely romantic journey from buddies to soulmates. Let’s move past the surface-level stuff and dig into the practical ways to make this trope truly profound.

The Foundation: They’ve Gotta Be Real Friends
Before any sparks can fly, you absolutely have to show that these characters are already genuinely, deeply friends. It’s not enough to just say, “Oh, they’re friends.” You need to show it in ways that make the eventual shift to romance feel incredibly meaningful. The stronger their friendship, the more impactful that change will be.


1. A History Worth Talking About:

Why are they even friends? What have they been through together? Flashbacks, little stories they tell, shared memories – these are gold. They convey that these two have a history, they’ve been there for each other through good times and bad.


For example, instead of just saying they’ve been friends since college, imagine this: “He’s the one who pulled her out of the ditch when her beat-up Civic died on the way to their final exam, using his dad’s antique wrench to MacGyver a fix. And she, in turn, nursed him through that horrific bout of food poisoning after their backpacking trip through Thailand, spoon-feeding him lukewarm broth and tolerating his incessant groaning.” See? That shows mutual support, resilience, and a history of overcoming stuff together.


2. They Know Each Other Inside Out:

They get each other. Their quirks, pet peeves, deepest fears, secret hopes – they know it all. There’s an almost psychic understanding between them; they can often tell what the other is thinking or how they’ll react. This comfort is super important because it shows the safety they feel with each other, which totally sets the stage for emotional vulnerability and romance later on.

You can show this through little details in conversations or even just their actions. “He knew her exact order at their favorite coffee shop – extra foam latte, no sugar, served in a ceramic mug, not paper, because she hated waste – without her having to utter a word. She could always tell when he was spiraling into an existential crisis by the way he chewed on his lower lip, a habit he only exhibited when deeply troubled.” That really hammers home their intimate understanding.


3. Unconditional Support, Total Respect:

They’re each other’s biggest fans and their go-to people for secrets. They offer advice, they listen, and their loyalty is unwavering. This mutual respect is key; if one character doesn’t truly respect the other, the romance will feel hollow.


Here’s how you might show that: “When her publishing deal fell through, he didn’t just offer platitudes. He just showed up with her favorite comfort food and listened for three hours, not interrupting, allowing her to vent every frustration. When he decided to quit his stable job to pursue his art, she was the first to offer to help him build his portfolio, even though it meant sacrificing her own weekend plans.” That’s active, non-judgmental support right there.


4. No Romance Allowed (Yet!):

This is crucial. You need to establish that romance is definitely not on the table for them, at least in their minds. Maybe they joke about it, or even dismiss any possibility, which just reinforces their platonic bond. This makes the eventual shift so much more impactful and creates that lovely internal conflict.

Imagine something like this: “They’d often joke about setting each other up with their friends, listing off incompatible traits with exaggerated groans. ‘You? A ‘soulmate’?’ she’d tease, poking his arm. ‘You’d drive anyone insane with your perpetual optimism and questionable taste in 80s rock.’ He’d just grin. ‘And you, my dear, would scare them off with your brutal honesty and aversion to small talk.’ The laughter that followed was always genuine, free of any romantic undertone.”
The Catalyst: The First Hint of Change
Real friends-to-lovers stories don’t just suddenly flip a switch. There has to be a catalyst – something that subtly, or not so subtly, changes their dynamic. It doesn’t have to be a huge explosion; it could be a series of small internal shifts or external events.



1. That “Moment of Seeing Anew”:

One or both of them suddenly sees the other in a completely different light. Maybe it’s after an unexpected situation, a truly grand gesture, or catching a glimpse of their vulnerable side. This is when the romantic “wiring” starts to short-circuit the platonic one.

For instance: “She’d always seen him as reliable, a rock. But when he stood up to her aggressive ex, not with anger, but with quiet, unwavering conviction and a protective glint in his eyes she’d never witnessed, something shifted. It wasn’t just friendship; it was… something more primal, something that made her heart pound.” Or: “He saw her perform her spoken word poetry for the first time, not the sarcastic, quick-witted friend he knew, but a raw, vulnerable artist pouring her soul onto the stage. The beauty and depth of her emotion struck him like a physical blow, and suddenly, his perception of her utterly transformed.”



2. A Hint of Jealousy:

Bringing in a new romantic interest for one of them can be a powerful trigger. The sudden fear of losing them, or seeing them happy with someone else, forces them to acknowledge deeper feelings. Just be careful here – we don’t want manipulative or petty jealousy. It should come from a genuine fear of loss or realizing what they could have.

You could show it like this: “When a charming new colleague started openly flirting with her, inviting her to dinners and concerts, he found himself experiencing an unfamiliar tightness in his chest. It wasn’t just protectiveness; it was a sickening lurch, a realization that the thought of her sharing her laughter and intimate stories with someone else was far more agonizing than it should be for ‘just a friend.'”


3. Proximity and Forced Intimacy:

An event that brings them physically closer or makes them more vulnerable can definitely speed things up. This might be a shared crisis, moving in together, or spending a lot of time collaborating on something.

Think about this: “A sudden family emergency forced them to road-trip cross-country together, sharing motel rooms, late-night talks, and navigating unexpected challenges. The physical closeness and emotional vulnerability brought on by the crisis, sharing each other’s fears and hopes during those long stretches of highway, erased the boundaries they’d always implicitly maintained.”
4. A Glimpse of “What If?”:

A hypothetical conversation or an imagined scenario where they’re a couple can plant that seed of possibility. Suddenly, what was unthinkable starts to seem appealing.

Here’s an example: “During a drunken, late-night conversation, a friend jokingly asked, ‘Why don’t you two just get married already? You’re basically an old married couple anyway.’ They both laughed it off, but later, in bed, she couldn’t shake the image of him across the breakfast table, not just a friend, but… a partner. The thought, initially absurd, now lingered, offering a strangely comforting possibility.”
The Escalation: That Deliciously Slow Burn
Once that spark is lit, the slow burn begins. This is where the tension really builds through subtle changes in behavior, internal thoughts, and interactions that just feel a little different. Don’t rush into big declarations of love!



1. A Shift in Physical Awareness:

Their casual physical interactions (like a friendly touch or playful shove) start to feel different, carry more weight. They become super aware of each other’s presence, their touch, even their scent. Their gazes linger a little longer.

Picture this: “His hand, which had always rested comfortably on her shoulder during their usual animated conversations, now felt impossibly warm, sending a jolt through her she hadn’t experienced before. She found herself acutely aware of the scent of his cologne – woodsmoke and something subtly citrusy – every time he leaned in close, a detail she’d never registered before.”
2. Internal Monologue: Doubt vs. Desire:

You need to show, not just tell, their inner struggle. They’re questioning their feelings, trying to tell themselves they’re wrong, and feeling a mix of elation and terror at these new emotions. This is where they realize there’s “no going back.”

For instance: “He watched her across the room, laughing at someone else’s joke, and felt a strange pang. ‘That’s just protectiveness,’ he told himself, but his gaze traced the line of her throat, the curve of her smile, and he knew, with a sickening lurch, it was more than that. ‘This is insane. She’s… Sarah. My best friend. This can’t possibly be happening.’ The denial was weak, a flimsy shield against the tidal wave of desire washing over him.”
3. Subtle Pushing and Testing the Waters:

One or both characters might start subtly testing the boundaries of their platonic relationship without explicitly stating their feelings. This could involve teasing, compliments that feel a little deeper, or inviting more intimate conversations.

Imagine: “After she successfully pitched her novel, he didn’t just say ‘Congrats.’ He looked at her, truly looked at her, and said, ‘You know, I’ve always known you had this in you. You’re brilliant, you know that?’ His voice was low, and the intensity in his gaze made her cheeks flush, something his usual compliments never did.”


4. The “Near Miss” or Almost Kiss:

This is fantastic for building intense sexual tension. They get so close to expressing or acting on their feelings, only to be interrupted or pull back at the very last second. It leaves both the characters (and us, the readers!) wanting more.

Like this: “They were huddled under a single umbrella during a sudden downpour, soaked and laughing, when their eyes met. The laughter died. His gaze dropped to her lips, and she felt herself unconsciously lean in, her pulse quickening. Then, a taxi horn blared, shattering the moment, and they both jerked back, suddenly awkward, the unspoken hanging heavy between them.”


5. Deeper Vulnerability and Sharing:

As their feelings grow, they start sharing more intimate details, more vulnerabilities, and fears they wouldn’t normally share even with their closest friends. This signals a whole new level of trust and emotional intimacy that really paves the way for romance.

For example: “After a particularly difficult family conversation, she found herself calling him, late at night. Instead of just commiserating, she confessed a deep-seated insecurity about her worth, something she’d never admitted to anyone, not even her therapist. His gentle, empathetic response, and the way he listened without judgment, melted a barrier she didn’t even realize she had.”
The Confession & The Payoff: The Big Leap
This is the turning point, the moment one or both characters finally acknowledge their feelings, risking everything for a chance at romance. The confession should feel completely earned, a natural result of all that building tension.



1. The Breaking Point:

Often, a specific event or just the sheer weight of their emotions forces the confession. It could be a significant threat to their friendship (like one moving away or getting engaged to someone else), or just the emotional pressure becoming unbearable.

Think about it: “He watched her packing her boxes, preparing to move across the country for a new job, and the thought of her leaving, of their daily coffees and late-night calls ending, became unbearable. He couldn’t imagine his life without her, not as just a friend. ‘No,’ he blurted out, startling them both. ‘You can’t go. Not like this. Not when…'”


2. The Raw Confession:

The confession itself should be heartfelt, raw, and delivered with genuine vulnerability. It’s not about big, dramatic speeches (unless that really fits the character) but about expressing the honest truth of their feelings, no matter what happens.

Like this: “He took her hand, his voice rough. ‘I know this is probably going to mess everything up, and I’m terrified of losing you. But I can’t pretend anymore. I’m in love with you. I have been, for a long time. More than just a friend. I want… everything with you.'”
3. The Response – Immediate or Delayed:

The reaction to the confession can be immediate and joyful, or it can be hesitant, requiring some processing. If it’s delayed, really show the internal conflict of the other character as they try to process this shocking revelation and their own buried feelings.

Immediate example: “Her eyes, wide with surprise, slowly softened. A small, shaky smile touched her lips. ‘It took you long enough,’ she whispered, and then she was in his arms, kissing him with a fierce urgency that banished all doubt.”
Delayed example: “She pulled her hand away, her mind racing. ‘I… I don’t know what to say. We’re friends, you’re my best friend. This… this changes everything.’ She retreated, needing space, but the confusion on her face was tinged with something he dared to hope was not entirely rejection.”


4. The First Kiss:

That first kiss is the big payoff for all that built-up tension and longing. It should feel incredibly impactful, reflecting the depth of their journey. It’s not just a kiss; it’s practically a declaration.

Imagine: “When his lips finally met hers, it wasn’t a tentative exploration, but a sudden, desperate claiming. It was the taste of years of unspoken words, of comfortable silences now filled with a roaring passion, of a friendship finally blossoming into something breathtakingly new.”
The Aftermath: Navigating the New Normal
The confession isn’t the finish line; it’s really just the beginning of a whole new chapter. The transition from friends to lovers isn’t always smooth sailing. There will be awkward moments, figuring out new boundaries, and re-learning each other in this new light.


1. The Awkward (But Sweet) Phase:

At first, there will absolutely be some awkwardness. They’ll overthink casual interactions, wonder about the “new rules.” This is totally normal and makes them feel more real.

Like this: “The next morning, making coffee, they kept bumping into each other in the small kitchen, their hands brushing, both pulling back quickly with flushed cheeks. What used to be a natural, effortless intimacy now felt charged, every touch a discovery.”


2. Re-defining Their Relationship:

They’ll need to figure out what their romantic relationship actually looks like. How does it affect their friend group? Their routines? Their individual lives?

For instance: “He’d always taken her for granted as his emergency contact. Now, telling his family, he found himself saying ‘my girlfriend’ and feeling a pleasant jolt of unfamiliarity. They talked for hours about how public they wanted to be, how much their daily routines would merge, and the delicate balance of maintaining their individual lives while building a shared one.”


3. The Lingering Fear of Ruining the Friendship:

This is a very common concern, especially strong in well-done friends-to-lovers arcs. They absolutely need to actively reassure each other that the foundation of their friendship is still there, even as their love grows.

You might see this: “Days after their first kiss, she found herself pulling back, worried they’d rushed things, that she’d somehow lost her best friend in the pursuit of a lover. ‘Promise me,’ she whispered, late one night, ‘promise me if this doesn’t work, we can still be friends.’ He squeezed her hand. ‘We’ll always be friends, no matter what. But I’m also going to fight like hell to make ‘this’ work, because being just friends isn’t enough anymore.'”


4. The Deepening Love:

Show how their unique history and incredible understanding of each other actually makes their romantic relationship even stronger and more profound than if they had been strangers. Their shared history becomes a wellspring of comfort, inside jokes, and unwavering support.

Years later, imagine them: “Curled on the couch, laughing at an old inside joke from their college days, she realized the depth of their love transcended mere passion. It was built on the decades of shared laughter, tears, and unwavering support. He didn’t just love her; he understood her on a cellular level, a love forged in the fires of true friendship.”
Wrapping Up: The Lasting Power of Found Love
Crafting a compelling friends-to-lovers story is a delicate dance. It asks for patience, authenticity, and a really sharp understanding of emotional nuance. It’s about building that rock-solid foundation of platonic connection, introducing a believable catalyst, and then meticulously building the tension through subtle but powerful interactions. The ultimate reward isn’t just a romantic pairing, it’s a testament to the enduring power of connection, the courage it takes to risk everything for love, and the profound beauty of finding your soulmate hiding in plain sight all along. By really thinking through these ideas, we can transform a familiar trope into an unforgettable journey of love.

1pep8od,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pep8od/coffee_as_a_career/,Coffee as a career,"Hello! Long time lurker here, started my coffee journey 5 years ago,  like many, with cold brew! The idea of coffee not just being bitter fuel but something that could be had without tons of sugar and additives really put me on. From there I'm sure you know how it goes, sub $200 grinder, V60, many many bad cups. Eventually I got better and leveled up quite a bit! Then sorta stagnated and bought comfy beans I could get a decent flash brew out of consistently. Recently (the last 6 months of 2025 or so), I feel like my coffee is better than ever, like I've reached a new level in being able to taste, react to a coffees needs, and understanding what I like in my coffee qualities.

Which brings me to now. I currently work double customer service/sales jobs, am surviving best I can, I'm not particularly miserable but there's just this growing nagging thought. When I spend time with coffee people, talk about coffee, visit my favorite shops, brew @ home and all of that, I'm genuinely excited about it, like almost to an obsessed point as of late. I find myself thinking: ""if I could make delicious coffee and hear what people think about it all day, I'd take less pay and be happier. Obviously,  the grass is always greener! Being a barista in the US is not the mental image ive been daydreaming about. I know how rough it can be, even working the Jamba Juice alone on lunch rush was enough to permanently traumatize me. It's hard work for little reward and I have zero experience with coffee as a profession!

I'm not looking for career advice on the pour over reddit, but I wanna ask you fine folk:

Are any of you baristas in your day job?

Does coffee being work, take the joy out of your coffee hobby at home?

Do you as a barista find it annoying to interact with a home enthusiast while on the job?

Would you still be a barista if you had a choice?

1pep8nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1pep8nk/2_weeks_of_orthodoxy_as_a_newbie_and_i_already/,"2 weeks of Orthodoxy as a newbie and I already feel terrible (+mild rant about life, health problems and religion)","TW: mentions of anti-LGBTQI+, racism, criticism/POVs towards other Christian denominations that are past beliefs or points-of-view of the writer, or the writer's associates, that the writer no longer supports. Health issues, income issues, bullying are also covered.



I was baptised Anglican; got bullied by choirboys and staff in a cathedral and had the desire to ""prove"" that I was someone important instilled into me (don't get me wrong, I was impertinent at times). I got older and stopped being bullied, being seen as more of the goof with deep-seated self-esteem problems. I already had issues with anxiety and paranoia since I first arrived in the UK at the age of seven, but at the end of my time in the choir I had issues with fatigue, disassociation and anger problems. I faked my voice breaking, probably to stroke my ego or something like that, and left just before COVID hit.

After that, I went sort of feral. I went haywire in my quest to ""prove"" myself and I went from being a goof to someone who would do many things for attention. Meanwhile my dad, a pretty senior architect, finally landed a job after the family practice finally gave out under COVID after years of struggling; this is specific, but if anyone neurodivergent here is thinking of practicing architecture in the UK, **don't do it**. *You'll feel the same stress and difficulty over many years of education as a medicine student, you'll have to compete with different colleagues and practices like you're in Law, all for the pay of a High School teacher if you can't network.* At one point my savings from being a choirboy was used to pay our house rent. Anyway, my mother -a cultural Catholic-Rosicrucian from Venezuela, a living tank who's fought through a lot- attributed this to praying to St Barbara, who's the patron saint of architects. My dad, whose mother was idiosyncratically both a witch and a zealous member of the Scottish Kirk, wasn't so convinced and kept to his Good News Bible while also teaching me about how churches aren't in the Bible, you shouldn't judge, and so on.

Three years ago, my dad was extra stressed with his new job, especially after I argued with him because I wouldn't do the dishes, or something like that. The morning after, he went on a long bicycle ride and after some thirty miles he had a cardiac arrest and died. Some people have said it's good he died doing something he loved, somewhat close to his hometown. Personally, I found the evident coincidences to be a little cruel. My old choirmaster, who liked me and my dad but was lacking in terms of safeguarding and how to deal with ND children, offered to play the organ at the funeral and was impressed that I knew the BWV numbers of the pieces. Wish he didn't say that: what was ego was about to become obsession (I know I sound dramatic here for the sake of keeping your engagement. I mean, I *am* being dramatic for the sake of keeping your engagement, but... Bear with me, this will come up again).

The months following, I was doing well for myself. That job my dad had actually came with a big payment following his death that made sure my mum wouldn't have to go to Venezuela while leaving me with my cousins up in Scotland. I got unusually good grades for someone who needs to be motivated by a same-day, midnight deadline to get stuff done. To stop thinking of the death of a third of my close family, I distracted myself in my free time with the video game Crusader Kings. There was a mod called ""When The World Stopped Making Sense"", set in the 5th or 6th century -or something like that. In the mod there were different descriptions for different Christologies and sects: Monophysite, Monothelite, Dyophysite, Ebionite, Nestorian... The list goes on and on and I soon found myself researching into historical Christianities.

At the end of my exams in June 2023, I tested positive for COVID. No biggie, I didn't feel anything at the time. But in the weeks that followed I had inexplicable muscle pain, I had a lot of tinnitus, my hearing felt as though it had lowered in pitch, my hand-limb coordination got worse and a mild case of Visual Snow I've had since I was younger turned into a persistent static across my field of vision that makes details and patterns pulsate into pain. My A-Level grades went out of the window as I panicked each day until I forced my mum to get me an MRI to make sure I didn't have a tumour. ""Lord God, by my research, Roman Catholicism has seemed to make the most sense. If no cancer shows up, I'll be Catholic. Amen."" -or something like that.

And, so it was. I've been to a mass before; my dad wanted to check out the famous crypt at Liverpool Met cathedral while my mum took me inside the main church zone and went, ""son: this is what a real mass looks like."" *Catholic aesthetics are on another level sometimes, in Caracas each year they process a giant statue of Jesus Christ carrying the cross, surrounded by blue flowers.* But my full mass was for a special, very traditional rite in Catholicism for ex-Anglicans. The first homily I ever heard was about how LGBTQI+ people are like nazis for putting their flags everywhere and that everyone who doesn't agree should leave. I was a little uncomfortable; I'm not going to call myself the perfect ally or anything but I never went full into that discourse because one of the few people to like me, respect me and enjoy my company was transgender. But nevertheless I stayed around the coffee and malt tea biscuits, I spoke to the priest and catechesis was begun quite hastily. I think they were quite eager to have me on as the target demographic of the rite is mostly Anglo-Catholic conservatives, not young people.

I was intensely zealous, although very socially awkward when people tried to be friendly. If you're ""different"" like me, you either risk saying something inappropriate or you force yourself to stay terse and robotic. I went radtrad to the max, going to the gym, desiring a military (naval) career, spending my mum's money of a bunch of Catholic memorabilia, calling Pope Francis a senile fool, telling off people on the Catholic subreddit for smooching girls. You know, the usual. However, cracks were beginning to grow. For one, my prayer routine kept collapsing. I started to miss catechesis classes and the such.

Still, I was making Catholicism my identity. I realised that I wouldn't be able to pass the medical qualifications to join the Royal Navy, so my next aspiration was to study at Oxbridge. I wanted to join one of the choirs so I could compose Latin music, record a few CDs and show off to my imaginary Anglican opponents how I'm no longer the goof, but now the competent classical musician who impressed his old choirmaster, yet secretly recusant-ed, and will be more noteworthy than all of them combined! -Or something like that. That'll show 'em! That'll show those people from years ago who probably... Don't really... Care... Or... Remember? Uh, well, yeeah. Anyway, I was finally confirmed in autumn, 2024. I don't want to get into the nitty gritty of what the bishop said during the homily, but it was clear that what he said did not impress any of the parishioners, to say the least.

After that, my faith took a bit of a tumble. The reasons for the tumble were, in the beginning, not theological. For starters, Trump won and the behaviour of Catholics online was terrible, and I began associating conservative Christianity with far-right movements. A male convert at a Catholic retreat kept putting me down in quite an aggressive way. My grades for my second attempt at A-Levels were struggling due to a bit of a fatigued state (mind you, more fatigued than I am usually fatigued). I went to get a blood test and it turned out I had vitamin D deficiency, which isn't uncommon for people with darker skin to have in the UK. Then, I got rejected from Oxbridge. My ego fantasy? Over. I got extra bitter and started ranting about it to my friends. Then someone in our class called me out and gave me a proper dressing down as to how I'm *A) Delusional, B) In denial that fame and success is for the very few, C) Suffering from a big persecution complex, D) How, even if I did became very famous and cool, it would probably go to my head and I'd end up like Elon Musk*. The speech was much longer and better in real life and everyone was in awe and gave him a few pats on the back. I was angry, and yet impressed, and yet confused. Still, I was able to brush it to the side temporarily, try and be more humble... That was, until the Catholic girl I was in a situationship let me go. We stayed friends but any emotive connection I had with Catholicism was coming to an end.

The logical connection that was severed was through reading old posts on r/AcademicBiblical and how Christianity was really like, way back then. How certain bishops \*ahem\* Cyril of Alexandria schemed to get their way, to grow their power and have opponents with near-identical beliefs excommunicated. I was tempted back after watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy **twice** on an aeroplane, but being in Australia and learning about the Catholic church there snapped me right back to saying no. I considered quitting Christianity entirely when an existential crisis when some quantum physics books led to concern over Epicurius' Problem of Evil in entropy at the existence of the universe itself until I saw a painting in the Queensland Art Gallery -Tintoretto's ""Cristo Risorgente""- that made me have a bit of a Eureka moment, in that I came up with a brand new theodicy that is pretty nifty and watertight. My trip to Australia this Summer was a big pitch in from my cousins and mum for me to get away from the UK for a while and learn what it's like in case I wanted to be a Geologist there (Geology is one of my A-Levels). Not sure how concerning it is if the highlight of the trip is a painting but I was also very nervous at the time because of terrible digestive issues. After it my mum also took me to Italy to see her old friends from Caracas. It's a big diaspora, now. I toyed with the idea of becoming a Catholic priest just to study there and have good access to the sun and food, even going back to confession in the UK. But my digestive problems continued and after several tests, including for blood in my stool that came back negative, I made the decision to cut out gluten entirely. I feel better now without, although occasionally I make a mistake with what I eat, realise too late, and get sick for a few days.

I started Uni this September, doing Geology. My A Levels turned out pretty crap, and I attributed my admittance into the Uni to some kind of miracle. But now I realise it was a mistake. You don't know what ""pact with the devil"" means until you sign yourself into a year-long lease in a flat you can't afford, to study at a uni for a course you don't want, in a city that's not good for you. Call me immature, I'm ready to hear it, but I have that same issue with motivation to study when my mum isn't here on my case. I do have difficulties with some of the material because of my severe colourblindness, and microscopes and fieldwork are tricky with the visual snow and all the phenomena that comes with it, but most of my bad performance comes down to simply not keeping up with the maths and not being willing to keep up with everything else because I don't have the interest I thought I did. Maybe I'll reapply for Geography closer to home next year. I miss my mum. My father, siblings, my godfather who was like a favourite uncle to me, my grandparents are all gone now. I have cousins who look out for me because my father was a good Christian and took care of them when their parents weren't parenting properly, but once my mum eventually dies (even though she is very strong) I'll have no one who loves, likes and understands me left on earth. 

It hasn't been all doom and gloom, though. I acquired some restorationist beliefs, both in terms of religion and my life; I've needed to pick up the pieces of who I am after 12 years of mental hardship, of people chastising my interests for not being like there's. I can't lie, I've had a few identity issues like any young person, although being ND and coming from two separate cultures complicates things (I didn't know that putting Colman's hot mustard on a Hallaca would be such a faux pas). To try and revisit how things were, I've been listening to music I used to like before I was ever in the choir, reading science books I used to like, watching films and TV shows I used to like, touching grass I hadn't touched in a while. I've tried to hearken back to a much simpler, Beatitudean faith that my dad introduced me to + applying my new theodicy. In addition, Methodist spirituality is quite sweet. The Methodist parish I've been to is low on numbers but filled with kind people who bring bread and tinned goods for the less fortunate to have. More modernist architecture and music helps me avoid reliving the past. For the first time in 12 years, it felt as though a large cloud of anxiety and dissociation had passed over. I was beginning to act well out of what I felt in my heart, not out of obligation. And for the first time, just for a week or two, without needing a request, or to escape anxiety, I was able to often pray sincerely to God with a worship book. By reciting one of Charles Wesley's hymn ""daystar in my heart appear"", the morning light shone through my window. 

However, I began to despair a little. I've had a hard time making friends at Uni. One of my only mates from college ghosted me, and one of the only friends I've been able to make says that I ""embarrass"" her: I guess I dropped the terse act, to become silly, too soon -or something like that. Even though I plan to not go onto the second year of the course, it still feels bad to struggle along. I started to get a little bitter when thinking about the difficulties of being ND and professional life; I'll never be in a position to exploit other people due to poor networking and workplace interaction, but will I be in a position to get employed and make enough money? I considered ministerial work but I'm worried I wouldn't ever be able to emigrate: an ambition I've had as long as I've been in the UK (maybe that's a psychological issue in itself but getting a therapist is easier said than done).

Thinking back to the roots of Methodist spirituality, I came to the reasoning that restorationism would mean that the church set up by Christ failed at some point, and that Orthodoxy was the way to go to be ""dead"" to the world of consumerism and liberalism -or something like that. I thought back to how a saint's intercession, Barbara, is the reason how my dad got his job and how we were able to afford to eat after he died. I first tried Divine Liturgy at a Greek Orthodox church but, wow, that place was Greek. I went to the next one along, which was in my home town. I was dreading it because I have a lot of bad memories with all the bullying and the stuff my dad went through there as a kid and later as a struggling professional. But the people on the Orthodox subreddit assured me that it would get better with counselling and that I should go anyway, or that by going I was now associating it with joy given that the services are meant to be Heaven on earth -or something like that. 

I've been to Vespers twice, catechumenate class twice, and Divine Liturgy twice. The internet really hypes Divine Liturgy but I feel nothing. I feel and pray even less than I did for the Catholic mass. Only vague familiarity to a dark **gothic** building that feels too much like the cathedral I sung in long ago. To me it's so difficult to understand, even in English. The saint veneration is intense, even more so than in the most traditional veins of Catholicism, and takes up a good chunk of the liturgy; I'm not opposed to the idea of venerating saints, but so much of the worship reserved for God seems repetitive and vague while the life of the saint is fleshed out. The priest is kind but some of the catechumens and converts are a little... Odd. *I get the pass to say that, I'm odd myself.* But they're odd in a way that's concerning. They're a mix of male and female, mostly students at the local Uni. I talked with two of the three young men there willing to talk to me: the first is a kind convert stuck around after Divine Liturgy to show me the ropes of altar serving. Another is socially awkward like me who joined a month back, who has a real passion for science and that sort of thing. But the rest are like sentinels, monolithics, all wearing the same black jackets, who don't really say much and just go through the motions. The catechumens and converts when they get together for catechesis make a lot of uncomfortable jabs at Catholicism. I know they're meant to be heterodox in the eyes of orthodox -or something like that- but to me it still feels a bit off. I also heard some weird jabs about Judaism and how their practices ""look"", which rubbed me the wrong way. One convert, an older lady, got agitated when my science friend called Putin a dictator saying that it's all Western propaganda. I don't even know the language and the last time I went was when I was a baby, but even then I felt awful considering the horrible puppet Putin has kept in charge of Venezuela and how he's scattered so many friends and family, who themselves are struggling to get by. And, of course, let's not forget all the people killed out of greed and fanaticism in Ukraine.

Meanwhile I can feel like I'm getting bitter again. Less charitable. Just today I thought, *""Wow, imagine how cool it would be to be a chanter? If my choirmaster came in one day he'd be impr- OH NO NOT AGAIN.""* It feels like I've gone back to square one in terms of improving as a person and also recovering -or something like that. Also, I've learnt that my theodicy that keeps my faith in a God, while perfectly Trinitarian and sound with the Nicene Creed, is technically heretical in that it supports a pre-existing human soul for Christ, which is close to Origen's view. The priest has offered to baptise me in a few months, but in doing so I would have to give up not just who I really am but also the God I really believe in. And so I feel very cold about it.

I also feel like, if I ran into my old transgender friend from high school she wouldn't want to talk to me anymore. My mum is supportive of my religious decisions, and says she wants to be the same religion as me, but I don't want to get her into something so drastic or stressful.

And yeah that's it. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Have any of you had a similar experience of backing out so soon? Have any of you gotten cold feet? Have any of you chosen a different church after Orthodoxy? Have you kept friends from Orthodoxy after Orthodoxy and have you kept LGBTQI+ friends from before Orthodoxy after Orthodoxy?",2,1764920913.0,exorthodox,0,1.0,False

Also some sort of owl and maybe other animal characters?
Don't remember anything about the gameplay, but it was simple enough for 6 year old me

I really hope im not just making this game up, it's been in my head for years.

When they arrived home, Al reached for the letter and packet on the dashboard. As he opened the door and stepped out halfway, he paused. Turning back to Charlie, his eyes softened, carrying a sincerity she hadn’t seen in years.

“I was thinking on the drive back,” he began, his voice steady but weighted with emotion. “I don’t ever want you to miss hearing these words from me: I love you. I’ve always been proud of you. And I’m sorry I haven’t been a better father to you.”

She froze, the weight of his words settling over her like a heavy blanket. Her lips parted, but no sound came out. She searched his face, looking for any sign of insincerity, but found none.

“I... I don’t know what to say,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. She wanted to believe him, wanted to cling to the warmth his words carried, but doubt lingered like a shadow, refusing to let go.

Her eyes dropped to her hands, twisting nervously in her lap. “You mean that? You’re not just saying it because... because of all this?”

Her voice wavered, betraying the fragile hope she was trying to hide.

He chuckled softly—a sound so rare it startled her. Reaching over, he tousled her hair, then smoothed it back with a tenderness she hadn’t felt in years. A broad smile broke across his face, one she could barely remember seeing.

“Chuck,” he said, his voice carrying the affectionate nickname that meant he was in a rare, good mood. “I’ve felt that way since the day you were born,” he continued, his tone steady but laden with emotion. “I’ve always wanted to be the best father I could be for you. But I’ve made (sigh)… a lot of mistakes. Mistakes I hate myself for. So, no. I’m not just saying it because of all this. It’s a dad thing. Always has been.”

Her lower lip trembled a little, and her eyes glistened as she looked up at him. For a moment, she didn’t say anything—just stared, as though trying to etch this moment into her memory forever. When she finally spoke, her voice was thick with emotion.

“I... I’ve always known you loved me, even when things were hard, even when you didn’t say it. But hearing it now... It means everything, Dad.” Her hand hesitated, then reached out to grab his arm, holding on tight. “You’re not perfect, but you’re my dad. And that’s all I’ve ever needed you to be.”

She swallowed hard, a tear slipping down her cheek, though she quickly wiped it away with her sleeve. “Thank you... for trying... for still being here for me. For not giving up.”

Her words were small, but they carried the weight of a lifetime of emotions—unspoken gratitude and a fragile glimmer of hope. Healing overdue, but maybe not impossible.

 

\*\*\*

 

Inside, Al moved to the dining room table and carefully poured the packet’s contents onto the surface. Papers spilled out—legal documents, property deeds, and a few personal letters. He gave her a cautious glance.

“Alright,” he said gently. “You can sit here with me, but let me go through this first. If there’s anything bad, I want it to hit me before you so I can soften the blow.”

“Okay, Dad,” she said quietly, sitting down at the edge of the table. Despite her nervousness, a flicker of hope warmed her chest—maybe there were answers here, something to explain her mother’s disappearance.

He sifted through the documents methodically, his face shifting between confusion and focus. Most of it seemed mundane, legal jargon hinting at the life Beverly had left behind. But then his hand froze mid-motion.

A single envelope, slightly heavier than the rest, slipped into his palm. Its weight felt wrong, unsettling. With trembling fingers, he opened it and pulled out its contents.

His face dropped like a stone, and a heavy silence filled the room.

“Dad?” Charlie’s voice wavered, the creeping sense of dread intensifying.

Before he could respond, something surged within her—a sudden, sharp heat flared on her left shoulder. It struck like a bolt of lightning, an excruciating flash that seared through her body as if something was branding her very soul.

She screamed, the sound raw and primal. The pain vanished almost as quickly as it came, but its echo lingered in her mind—a phantom sensation that left her trembling.

Her hands flew to her shoulder, and her breathing came in shallow gasps. “No, no, no,” she muttered, her voice quaking. “Dad—what’s happening?”

Al dropped everything and leaped to her side, pulling her into his arms as her panic spiraled. “Charlie! Talk to me—what’s wrong?!” His voice cracked, desperate to understand.

She couldn’t answer. Tears streamed down her face as the reality set in. She clawed at the sleeve of her shirt, yanking it down to expose her shoulder. The mark—the Eclipse Mark—gleamed faintly, its dark center surrounded by a thin, flickering ring of dim light.

Her sobs turned into hysterical cries. “No! No! I don’t want this! Why is this happening to me?”

He tightened his grip around her, his own fear buried beneath a fragile mask of determination. “It’s okay, baby. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. We’ll figure this out, I promise.”

But his eyes betrayed him, drawn back to the envelope still sitting on the table. The contents spilled across the surface, and his stomach churned at the sight—a jagged piece of human skin, its torn edges curling slightly. It lay atop a folded letter, mocking him with its grotesque stillness.

That mark—the same one now burned into Charlie’s shoulder—stared back at him like an accusation he couldn’t ignore. Beverly’s disappearance began to form a picture he wasn’t ready to see.

This wasn’t just a random twist of fate.

This was a calculated choice.



 

**May 3rd, 2022 – 3:17 PM**

Al was heading up to the guest room when the realization struck—it wasn’t just a guest room anymore. It was her room now. Beverly’s leaving had made that clear. There was no denying it anymore.

The memory of yesterday clawed at him. He’d tried to console Charlie when the mark appeared, but her reaction had been as fiery as it was devastating. She had flown into hysterics, her words cutting into him like shards of glass.

“This is your fault!” she had screamed, her voice raw and venomous. “You knew this could happen! You let this happen!”

Her accusations were relentless, each one laced with a pain so sharp it felt like a physical blow. In the chaos, only his favorite coffee cup had shattered—but her words… her words had broken far more.

Overwhelmed and desperate for some semblance of safety, she had run to the guest room and locked herself inside. For hours, Al had stood on the other side of that door, helpless. At first, he’d heard her sobs—muffled and raw. Then came the silence. It was an eerie, oppressive quiet that pressed against him like a vice.

Now, standing outside that same door, the weight of everything crushed him. Guilt gnawed at him relentlessly, tearing at the edges of his composure. This was the moment he had feared for so long. He’d tried to prepare for it, to brace himself, but no amount of mental armor could shield him from this. Knowing it might come was one thing. Living it was something else entirely.

When Charlie had first come to him with Beverly’s disappearance, he’d convinced himself that Beverly’s actions would eventually lead her to become one of the Gloomcrawlers. But this… this was darker. The contents of that envelope had made it undeniable. This wasn’t coincidence. Beverly had made a deal with the Matron.

He had read Beverly’s letter over and over, the truth scrawled in her familiar hand as damning as any sentence. She had sacrificed their daughter. To save herself, Beverly had traded their child’s future for her own freedom.

He wanted to rage at the unfairness, to punch a hole in the wall, to do something—anything—to push back against the storm of disgust and despair roiling in his chest. But it wouldn’t change the facts.

Beverly, the woman he had once loved so deeply, had bartered their daughter’s life.

Knocking lightly on the door, he let out a shaky breath, his hands trembling at his sides. His heart ached at the thought of Charlie suffering alone on the other side. He wanted to comfort her, to take her pain away, but he didn’t know how.

“Hey…” he began softly, his voice faltering. “I’m not sure how to do this, so I’m just gonna… try. I know I haven’t been the dad you needed, but I’m trying now. I’m gonna stand here and be…”

Before he could finish, the door burst open, and Charlie ran straight into his arms, colliding with him in a desperate need to feel safe. She clung to him as if he were the only solid thing left in her crumbling world, her sobs raw and unrelenting.

“Why me?! Why me, Dad?!” she cried over and over, her words fractured by gasps for air.

He didn’t speak. He couldn’t. He just held her tightly, his own heart shattering with every tear she shed. There were no words to make this better, no comfort to erase the pain she was feeling.

He waited, letting the storm pass. The sobs gradually slowed, her breath hitching as she struggled to regain control. Silence settled over them, heavy but grounding. Al gave her the space to gather herself, knowing what he needed to say next would break her all over again.

 

\*\*\*

 

Eventually, they moved to the living room. Charlie perched on the edge of the couch, her posture tense, braced for impact. Al sat beside her, one arm resting along the back of the couch, the other holding a box of tissues she hadn’t yet touched. Her eyes glistened with fresh tears that refused to fall, hanging on by sheer force of will.

His thoughts raced, but no words seemed adequate. How do you tell a child that the person she trusted most, the one who was supposed to protect her, had bartered her future away?

He rubbed her back in slow, steady circles, trying to soothe her trembling shoulders. His voice cracked as he spoke her name. “Charlie…”

He cleared his throat, forcing himself to meet her gaze. “I know why you got the mark.”

Her head snapped toward him, her eyes wide with disbelief and a desperate, fragile hope. “You do?” Her voice was small, barely more than a whisper, as though she were afraid to hope.

He nodded, the weight of her gaze pressing heavily against his chest.

*Bev… if I ever see you again…*

The thought burned in his mind, but he shoved it aside. Charlie needed him now, and there was no room for anger—not yet.

“Sweetie...” He took a shaky breath, his hand stilling on her back. “I don’t even know where to begin. There’s no easy way to say this, but I have to. You deserve to know the truth.”

A single tear slipped down her cheek, carving a silent path across her face. She brushed it away absently, her voice trembling but resolute. “Tell me,” she whispered.

Her words hung in the air like a challenge he wasn’t sure he could meet. But he had to. For her.

Al exhaled, glancing at her. “I think you need to understand your mom definitely knew this was going to happen.”

“How?” Charlie asked, tilting her head.

“That note… the one with the ‘useless map.’ She underlined ‘marked’ as her first clue. However, you need to see everything in the packet.”

Charlie’s mind spun. Her mother had tried to tell them she was going to be marked—but how would she have known?

He looked at her and braced himself for what he knew would be the most devastating thing he would ever have to say. “I brought everything with me to show you, and I need you to understand—this is going to be hard. Maybe the hardest thing you’ll ever hear. But before I do, I need you to know something.”

His voice gentle, steady but trembling with emotion. “I will never abandon you. Never. I swear on my life, Charlie, I will die to protect you. That’s my promise. That dad thing again.”

He tried to comfort her, clinging to the hope that it might soften the blow. But deep down, he knew it wouldn’t. Nothing could.

She nodded faintly, her gaze dropping to her hands. “Thank you, Dad…” Her voice was quiet, almost childlike.

Her words hit him like a punch to the gut, making what he had to do next even harder. He couldn’t shield her from this. He didn’t have that power.

“So…” He swallowed hard, forcing himself to continue. “The envelope here has a couple of things in it. I need you to stay as calm as you can, but I know this is going to be bad. Worse than you’re ready for. Please, believe me when I say I wish it wasn’t. And Charlie…” His voice dropped lower, thick with emotion. “I love you. Never doubt that. Okay?”

“Okay…” she whispered, her voice trembling.

With unsteady hands, Al reached into the envelope and pulled out the first item: a jagged piece of skin. Marked with the familiar Eclipse symbol, its torn edges curled slightly, as if recoiling from what it had been forced to endure. He placed it carefully on the table between them.

Charlie recoiled, her breath catching as her eyes locked onto the grotesque object. “Is that… what I think it is?” Her voice wavered, disbelief and revulsion twisting together, raw and unfiltered.

Al let out a heavy sigh, running his hands over his face as though trying to will away the moment. “Yeah…” His voice was quiet, pained. “And this… this is just the beginning of the whole damn mess.”

She flinched at his words. Her father rarely swore, and when he did, it meant something was deeply, horribly wrong. But even then, she wasn’t ready for what came next.

He pointed to the skin, his voice tightening. “That? It’s your mother’s.”

The words hit her like a lightning strike. Her breath held, and she almost fell back as though the truth itself had shoved her.

Her voice broke, rising into a scream as fresh tears poured down her cheeks. “MOM?! SHE’S DEAD?!”

“No, no!” Al said quickly, his own voice cracking under the weight of it all. “She’s not dead.” He hesitated, his face contorted with disgust. “Not yet, at least.”

She stared at him, her body trembling, her breath coming in shallow gasps. Al took a deep breath to steady himself, but his words carried the crushing weight of what he was about to reveal.

“This… this was part of the price she paid to leave. Her ‘pound of flesh,’ so to speak. She made a deal with the Matron to get out of Everfall.”

Charlie’s mind reeled, struggling to grasp the enormity of what she’d just heard. “Leave Everfall?” she repeated, her voice sharp and edged with disbelief. “Can’t you just drive away?”

Al gave her a grim, bitter smile, the lines around his mouth tightening with frustration and years of failed attempts. “Sure, you can drive away,” he said, his tone cutting. “You might even make it a few states over. But within a day or two, you’ll wake up right back here, as if you never left. Every single time I’ve tried, I’ve ended up back in my bed like nothing happened.”

Her eyes widened, her breath catching in her throat. “You’ve been stuck here all this time? Ever since you got the mark?”

“Yep.” His response was flat, drained of emotion, as if the weight of it had long since crushed him. The resignation in his voice was like a hollow echo. But then his expression shifted, darkening into something stormy and raw. A flicker of anger reignited in his eyes.

“But back to your mother…”

Charlie clung to the words as if they were a rope, trying to pull meaning out of them even as her mind pushed back. “So, she made a deal with the Matron to get away and… had her mark cut off?” The question scraped past her lips. “That’s why you’re angry?”

“That was part of it,” he said quietly, every syllable taut with controlled fury. “But there’s more—something I can’t forgive.” His jaw tightened; a hard line ran down his neck. “There’s a reason she underlined ‘marked’ on the note she left you.”

He let the pause sit between them, then met her eyes, the edges of his face softening a fraction. “I’ll let you read it. But you have to be ready. I’ll be right here the whole time. If you need to hold on to me, I won’t let go. Understand?”

Charlie hesitated, her hands trembling as she reached for the letter. She nodded faintly, unable to speak, her heart hammering in her chest.

The paper felt heavy in her hands, as though it carried the weight of every unanswered question, every shred of doubt that had haunted her since her mother disappeared. With a deep, trembling breath, she unfolded it.

As her eyes scanned the words, her world crumbled.

The realization hit her like an avalanche, burying her under a mountain of unbearable truth. Each word clawed at her, ripping away what little stability she had left. Her mother’s familiar handwriting, once a source of comfort, now felt like a blade carving through her chest.

Her breathing turned to shallow gasps, her vision blurring as tears spilled unchecked down her face. Her hands shook, the letter quivering in her grip as though it might shatter under the weight of its contents.

The words were merciless, impossible to refute. The truth burned into her mind with excruciating clarity: her mother, the one person she had trusted above all else, had betrayed her. Beverly had sacrificed her own daughter, handing her over to the Matron to take her place.

Charlie stared at the letter, her body frozen, her mind spiraling into a chasm of disbelief and pain. She couldn’t look away, couldn’t stop the torrent of emotions crashing over her—shock, grief, betrayal. They threatened to drown her.

Her mother had chosen her own freedom over Charlie’s life.

The letter slipped from her hands, fluttering to the floor. Her lips moved soundlessly, trying to form words, but none came. She felt hollow, gutted, as if the betrayal had carved out a part of her she’d never get back.

She sat motionless, staring into nothing, as the full weight of her mother’s choice crashed over her like a crushing tide.

Al’s voice blurred into the background, his light shaking registering only as faint tremors against her dazed expression.

  
**May 7th, 2022 - 7:13 AM**

Dawn had broken, the early light spilling through the windows, but Al had been up for hours. Sleep eluded him, his mind gnawed by relentless worry.

Charlie had unearthed an old notebook from her room, buried beneath a pile of forgotten clothes in the closet. At first, it had seemed like a harmless distraction, a way to pass the time. But it had quickly morphed into something darker—an obsession. She poured herself into it with a manic energy that teetered on the edge of desperation.

She barely left her room anymore. The notebook consumed her. Its pages filled rapidly with scrawled words and jagged sketches, each darker and more frantic than the last. Whenever Al tried to check on her, her responses were clipped, distracted—her focus locked on the notebook, as if it were the only thing tethering her to reality.

The drawings unnerved him—twisted figures, shadowy shapes, and endless renditions of the Eclipse Mark, sketched with a near-ritualistic intensity. The writing was worse. It was raw, angry, and dripping with pain—accusations, fragmented thoughts, and looping questions that spiraled endlessly. This wasn’t an outlet. It was swallowing her whole.

He could see the toll it was taking. Her hair was unkempt, her clothes unchanged, her face hollow and etched with exhaustion. She hardly ate or drank. Her world had narrowed to the notebook, and it was consuming her, piece by piece.

He’d given her room to vent, but he couldn’t take it anymore. Watching her spiral in silence was no longer an option.

“Hey...” he said softly, hesitant, as he stood in her doorway. “I’m coming in.”

There was no response.

He stepped into the room, his eyes scanning the chaos. Torn pages littered the floor—some crumpled, others spread flat like artifacts in a shrine. Charlie sat on the bed, the notebook open on her lap, pen in hand, though she wasn’t writing. She stared down at the pages, her eyes unfocused, distant.

“Charlie…” His voice straining under the weight of his worry. “I don’t know how to fix this, but I need you to know I’m here for you. You don’t have to do this alone.”

He moved cautiously, crossing the room to sit beside her on the bed. His arm came around her shoulders, his touch gentle, tentative, as though she might shatter.

She stiffened at first, her body rigid beneath his touch. Then, after a long pause, she leaned into him slightly, her head tilting just enough to rest against him. Her glassy, dull eyes flickered with something—barely a spark of recognition.

“Dad…” Her voice was a fragile thread, barely audible. She hesitated, her breath hitching. “She’s never coming back, is she?”

Al’s chest tightened. The words weren’t really a question; they carried the weight of something she already knew—a truth she had accepted despite the crushing pain.

He swallowed hard, forcing his voice to steady. “No, sweetheart. She’s not,” he admitted. “But I’m here. No matter what, I’m here. We’ll get through this together. I promise.”

She didn’t respond, but she didn’t pull away either. It was a small thing, a fragile connection, but it was something.

 

\*\*\*

 

Several hours later, he managed to get Charlie to lie down for a nap. She never let go of the notebook, clutching it like a lifeline.

He sat at the kitchen table, staring at the remnants of a cold cup of coffee. The image of Charlie haunted him—the hollow look in her eyes, the frantic energy she poured into the notebook. The words she’d written echoed in his mind, just as haunting as the ones left unwritten.

He had to do more. She needed something to pull her out of the spiral—something familiar, something she loved. A faint chuckle escaped him as the answer came to him. Of course. He knew exactly what it was.

Christmas morning, 2017. He could still see her face lighting up brighter than the tree behind her as she unwrapped the electric keyboard. It was sleek and modern, loaded with every bell and whistle a musician could want. She’d spent days exploring its features, experimenting with soundscapes and melodies. Beverly had rolled her eyes at the expense, but Al had known it would mean the world to Charlie. To him, it had been worth every penny.

He’d stretched his modest freelance writing income and savings to cover not just the keyboard but piano lessons as well. Within six months, she was playing better than anyone had expected—even her tutor. But Al knew it wasn’t just talent. It was an escape. During those years of turmoil—when Beverly’s instability and his own struggles drove a wedge between them—Charlie had poured her heart and soul into that keyboard. It had become her sanctuary.

And now, more than ever, she needed that sanctuary back.

The piano was still at Beverly’s house, just waiting, sitting in the corner of the living room.

With sudden resolve, Al stood and grabbed his jacket. If there was even a chance it could help her, it was worth it.

 

\*\*\*

 

Charlie didn’t hear him leave or return an hour later. Lying there, her mind was caught in a relentless loop, memories twisting into cruel distortions that lashed at her fragile self-worth.

A dark female voice in her mind sneered, venom dripping from every word. “See? She didn’t want you. She was just fattening you up for slaughter.”

Her expression was vacant, hollow—the only emotion she could summon. “I wasn’t enough…” she whispered to no one, her voice dry and lifeless.

A faint pulse of heat ghosted over her left shoulder where the Eclipse Mark lay, but she barely registered it. Her eyes remained fixed on the worn pages of the notebook, unable—or unwilling—to look away, trapped in the endless cycle of her unraveling thoughts.

Then… the sound of a trill of notes broke the suffocating stillness, cutting through the haze like a single drop falling into dark, rippling water. For a fleeting moment, the gnawing ache in her chest paused—confusion slipping into the cracks of her numbness.

“Music…?” The word slipped from her lips, distant and hollow, as though it belonged to another life. Her mind strained, brushing against a faint memory wrapped in warmth and light—a forgotten echo of something safe.

The darkness within recoiled, hissing in defiance. “It’s nothing. A trick.”

But the sound lingered, stubborn and alive, carving through the oppressive haze that held her captive.

Another note followed, sharper this time, clear and resolute.

Her fingers twitched—a phantom reflex from years of playing, her muscle memory untouched by grief. The notebook in her lap suddenly felt heavier, its pages cold and lifeless compared to the living pulse of sound that dared to intrude.

A fragile spark of hope ignited deep within her. She clung to it, uncertain, as the notes faded into silence once more.

Would the music return… or was it already too late?

Then it happened again. It wasn’t a trill but a couple of clumsy, hesitant chords. Yet they pierced through her despair like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.

The notebook and pen slipped from her grasp, tumbling onto the floor amid a scatter of torn pages—the aftermath of her internal war.

The fog clouding her mind began to lift. She fought to focus on the sound, the sweet, familiar sound she knew could free her from the soul-consuming despair. She pushed herself upright, groggy but determined. Her legs stretched off the edge of the bed as she stood shakily. Holding onto the railing for support, she navigated each step slowly.

Al heard her and rushed to the stairs. “Hey, kiddo. Do you need help down? I brought you something. I know you heard it.”

He smiled briefly, but his expression turned to concern as she stumbled. He bounded up several steps to catch her before she collapsed, the exhaustion of sleepless nights catching up to her.

Once he got her to the ground floor, he guided her to the bench. He watched her carefully as she sat, her eyes drawn to the keyboard. Al saw the faintest flicker of something familiar as she placed her fingers gently on the keys. Slowly, she pressed down, and a rich, dulcet chord resonated through the room.

She paused, her breath catching as the sound washed over her. It felt too pure, too real for her system. Then, she played.

The first notes were soft, hesitant, but quickly grew into a haunting melody. The song flowed from her fingertips, each note improvising on the pain within her. It was her soul finding its voice, speaking the words she couldn’t.

As the music swelled, silent tears began to slip down Charlie’s cheeks. Her fingers moved instinctively, the melody swelling, louder and faster, as though the keys were the only way to pour out the storm raging inside her. Each note was raw, unfiltered, speaking of betrayal, loss, and anguish.

Her sobs turned to gasps as her hands slammed the keys, the sound growing aggressive and jarring. The catharsis overwhelmed her, and finally, she screamed—a long, raw cry that tore from her chest, shattering the air and shaking Al to his core.

“Charlie!” Al rushed to her side, pulling her away from the piano and into his arms. She resisted at first, her sobs shaking her frail frame, but he held her firmly, his voice low and steady.

“Let it out,” he murmured. “Let it all out, baby. I’ve got you. I’m here.”

Her resistance crumbled, and she collapsed into his arms. Her screams dissolved into broken cries, her pain spilling freely as Al rocked her gently. His arms were a fortress, shielding her as the dam of her sorrow finally broke. His own tears slid silently down his face, but he said nothing more, letting her grief pour out unchecked.

As her cries eventually softened, the room fell silent, save for the faint, lingering hum of the piano. Al began to hum, forming a simple, soothing lullaby. His voice was untrained but warm, the melody wrapping around her like a blanket.

“Rest now… You’re safe...” he said gently.

For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Charlie felt the weight on her chest lift—if only slightly. Exhausted, she leaned into him, her breathing evening out as the last of her tears fell.

The music, the safety he gave her with no judgments, the lullaby—it wasn’t everything. But for now, it was enough.



 

**May 10th, 2022 - 8:21 PM**

The last box of Charlie’s belongings had been moved into the house earlier that afternoon. Al had spent the better part of the past few days coordinating the handling of Beverly’s old place—sorting through the clutter, and ensuring every piece of Charlie’s life was safely brought over.

Now, the house she had grown up in stood empty—a hollow shell of memories and betrayals she was eager to leave behind.

Al hadn’t told Charlie much about the process. She didn’t need to dwell on that house—it needed to stay in her past. Her focus should be on healing and moving forward. But every time he caught her staring out the window in its direction, he could see the weight of her thoughts pulling her down, threatening to drag her into another spiral.

She hadn’t experienced a Shift yet. For that, Al was deeply grateful. She hadn’t seen the suffocating darkness, the desolation, or the horrors that roamed within. He bore that knowledge alone, a burden he would carry for as long as he could. But he knew her time was coming—it was inevitable.

Charlie stood by the living room window, resolute, her gaze locked on the faint silhouette of the part of town where her childhood home still stood. Her hands rested on the windowsill, her fingers absently tracing patterns on the worn wood. The streetlamp outside cast a warm glow that softened her features, but her expression remained distant, unreadable.

“Dad, what happens to the people who aren’t marked? Where do they go?” she asked, her tone oddly calm, her head tilted slightly.

“Nowhere,” he replied, leaning back on the couch behind her. “They’re here the whole time. It’s us that go into the Shift—into a liminal space. It’s like time freezes here until we come back.”

She didn’t respond immediately, her fingers pausing as she processed his words. Al could see her mind working, piecing together fragments of memory.

“Sometimes…” she started slowly, almost to herself, “it feels like everything flickers. Like blinking faster than normal. I thought it was just me being… weird.”

Al sat forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “That’s part of it. Most people notice something—a glitch, a flicker—but they don’t understand what it is. You’ve probably seen it before and didn’t think twice about it.”

She nodded faintly, her gaze drifting back to the window. The quiet stretched between them like a taut wire, the air thick with unspoken tension.

Then, she broke the silence.

“She’s there,” Charlie said suddenly, her voice low but certain. Her gaze didn’t waver from the shadowed house in the distance.

Al followed her line of sight, his jaw tightening. “Charlie… you don’t know that.”

“Yes, I do,” she insisted, her fingers curling into fists on the windowsill. “I can feel it. She’s pulling at me, like she wants me to come to her.”

Al rose, crossing the room to stand beside her. He rested a hand gently on her shoulder, his touch steady. “That’s the mark,” he said quietly. “The Matron’s influence. She’s trying to lure you back.”

Charlie turned to him, her wide, searching eyes brimming with a question she couldn’t quite bring herself to ask. “But what if it’s not just the Matron? What if it’s… her? What if she’s—”

The word “mom” stuck in her throat, unspoken, as though saying it would make the possibility too real. Despite the anger and loathing she felt for Beverly, the thought of her mother becoming a monster was unbearable. It was a finality she couldn’t yet face, no matter how much she tried.

“Charlie,” Al interrupted, his tone firm but kind. “Even if it is her… it’s not safe. Your mom…” He hesitated, his voice weary. “She made her choice. You can’t follow her down that path.”

Tears welled in Charlie’s eyes, but she blinked them away, her jaw tightening. “I just… I don’t understand. How could she do this to me?”

Al sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I wish I had an answer for you, kiddo. I’ve asked myself that a thousand times, and I still don’t know. What I do know is that she didn’t start out like this. She was… lost. And the Matron? She preys on that. On weakness, pain, regret.”

Charlie turned back to the window, her reflection staring back at her like a ghost. “What if I end up like her?” she whispered.

“You won’t,” Al said firmly, squeezing her shoulder. “You’re stronger than she was. You’re still here, and I’m not going to let you go through this alone.”

For a moment, silence filled the room, heavy yet comforting. Charlie leaned her forehead against the cool glass, her breath fogging the surface. “Sometimes it feels like the mark is alive, like it’s… feeding on me.”

Al’s grip on her shoulder tightened slightly. “That’s because it wants you to think that. The Matron’s power thrives on fear and despair. But you don’t have to give her that. You can fight it.”

She turned to him, her eyes searching his face for reassurance. “Do you really believe that?”

His sudden laughter startled her. “I absolutely do,” he said, a faint smile breaking through his usual somber demeanor. “Let me remind you—your stubbornness is unmatched. You refused to sleep anywhere but on the floor by that window until I moved the couch for you. That kind of resolve? It might just save you.”

His expression softened. “Keep your wits about you. You’re a smart girl, Charlie. Just learn to rein in your emotions. I’ll tell you this: stoicism, though difficult at times, helps.”

Charlie felt a flicker of hope—fragile, but real. She turned back to the window, the distant house no longer feeling like a looming shadow, but a relic of the past she had to leave behind.

“Dad,” she asked quietly, her voice hesitant, “we have to do bad things in the shift… don’t we?”

“Yeah,” he admitted, his tone heavy. “Stuff I wish we didn’t have to do. But it’s not like we have much of a choice. Either that, or we turtle up until we’re forced out of hiding.”

Charlie mulled this over, her expression darkening before shifting into something sharp, almost defiant. A sly smile tugged at her lips. “Then I know something I can do during a shift…”

Al tilted his head, wary. “Oh? And what’s that?”

Her smile grew faintly, unmistakably devious. “I can burn Mom’s house down.”

# Phases of Fear: The Town That Shifts Into Darkness Part 1A

**Sunday, May 1st, 2022 - 12:17 PM**

Charlie stared at the note, holding its edges. Her mother’s handwriting—once careful, now hurried and uneven—covered the page.

""If you don’t hear from me by noon Sunday, I need you to go to the place marked below.""

Her mother had been gone since Friday.

On the map below, her dad’s house was circled over and over, the pen cutting deep, nearly tearing the paper. A knot tightened in Charlie’s chest. She flipped the page, breath hitching. At first, the back seemed blank—until she tilted it under the light. Faint indentations emerged, half-erased words lingering like ghosts:

*It has to be done.*

*No other way.*

The penmanship was rushed, the letters uneven, as if written in desperation. Charlie’s pulse quickened.

Movement outside caught her eye: neighbors tending fire pits, faint smoke trails drifting skyward. Further down, another family tied red and yellow ribbons to their fence with careful precision.

She’d forgotten—today was Beltane.

Childhood warnings resurfaced in her mind: flickering fires lit to ward off the “Dark Mother,” a shadowy legend to scare children into staying close. Wander too far, they said, and she’d claim you for her “shadowed brood.” Charlie had always dismissed it as folklore, but watching the flames curl higher and ribbons twist urgently in the breeze, unease tightened her chest. This year felt different. Too vivid. Too real.

Her gaze drifted back to the note. She ran a thumb over the paper’s jagged edges, her pulse hammering like it could force meaning from the fibers beneath her touch.

What was this about? Why the map? Why so cryptic?

“Mom, where are you?” she whispered, gripping the note tighter.

Her mom’s disappearances weren’t unusual. Since Charlie turned sixteen, they'd become routine—explained away as sudden overtime or new boyfriends. But this time, the hurried handwriting, the half-erased words, and the map circled repeatedly and nearly torn by pen marks felt unmistakably like a warning.

She mentally replayed the last time she saw her mom, searching for any clue she'd missed. Her mother had smiled warmly that day. But beneath it, Charlie remembered something sharper—fleeting, unmistakably fearful. At the time, she'd ignored it; dismissed it as imagination. But now, that buried detail dug into her memory like a thorn.

And then there was the perfume. Her mom had hugged her that day, and Charlie noticed the vanilla scent—soft, sweet, unsettlingly unfamiliar. It clung to her clothes long afterward, haunting her in a way she couldn’t quite explain.

Charlie’s fingers shook as she dialed the hospital. When the receptionist answered, her calm, detached voice clashed with the pounding in Charlie’s chest.

“She came in Friday to resign,” the woman said, her tone clinical. “Asked for her final paycheck. Said it was a family matter…”

Charlie’s breath caught sharply. “What?” Her voice cracked. “She—she resigned?”

It made no sense. Her mom loved that job—always called it her stability. Charlie barely registered the receptionist’s concerned follow-up, ""Is everything okay?”

“Yeah, sorry.” She hung up, gripping her phone as if it might keep her grounded. Why would her mom leave everything without telling her?

Her gaze returned to the map. There was no denying it—she had to go to her dad’s house. A thought flickered through her mind, uninvited and unwelcome: What if Mom’s already there?

The idea sat uneasily in her chest. She wasn’t close to him—not the way she was with her mom. His strict household rules and controlling protectiveness made every conversation feel carefully measured, like navigating an invisible minefield.

Still, if anyone could make sense of this madness, it was him.

Her parents had never fit neatly into town life. Whispers followed them, labeling them paranoid, eccentric—perhaps even dangerous. Charlie usually ignored the gossip, yet she couldn't deny there was something unsettling about her father, something that kept neighbors wary.

But despite all of it—despite his distance, despite the town’s mistrust—he had always been their fallback. When things spiraled, when the ground beneath them threatened to collapse, he was the one who kept everything from completely falling apart. Whether she liked it or not, he was the only person left who might have answers.

All she could cling to was the fragile hope her mother was safe with him.

Charlie grabbed her purse and house key and stepped outside.

The midday air was thick with something she couldn’t name. As she walked, she noticed details that hadn’t registered before—flickering candles on windowsills, wildflowers tied to porch railings, children skipping down the sidewalk with bundles of sticks. The fires in the neighborhood glowed unnaturally bright, their heat pressing against her skin as she passed.

She stopped at stores, knocked on doors, asked neighbors if they’d seen her mother. No one had. With each closed door, the weight in her chest deepened.

Her thoughts drifted back to the past week. Was this why her mom had seemed so distant?

It had started subtly—little things. Her mother staring out the window, twisting her hair absently. “When you were five, you used to sneak cookies,” she’d said out of nowhere one evening, her voice distant.

Charlie had laughed. “And you knew. You’d catch me before I even took a bite.”

Her mother didn’t laugh. She only watched Charlie for a long, unreadable moment before muttering, “You’re still sneaky,” and walking away.

At the time, Charlie had thought nothing of it. Now, it wouldn’t leave her alone. The feeling it provoked surged through her, and her body was already moving before her mind caught up.

She flew up her dad’s porch steps, nearly slamming into the door. Her fingers scrabbled for the handle, then she pounded against the wood, her voice breaking.

“Dad! Open the door!”

The door jerked open, and there he was. Al. His expression shifted from confusion to concern, but Charlie shoved past him before he could speak.

“Mom! Mom! Where are you?!”

“Charlie!” Al called after her, his voice rising. “She’s not here!”

She barely heard him. Two steps at a time, she tore up the stairs, wrenching open every door.

*Empty*

*Empty.*

 *Empty*

 With each room, the sick feeling in her gut grew heavier.

“Charlie, wait!” Al was behind her now, his tone firm. “She’s not here.”

At the top of the stairs, she stopped short. Her legs buckled, and she sank onto the step, gripping the railing hard. Her breath came too fast—sharp and ragged against the hush that blanketed the house.

Al crouched beside her, his voice steady, calm—more patient than she remembered.

“Sweetie, slow down. Just sit. What happened?”

Her voice wavered. “Dad… Mom’s gone. I don’t know where. Please—please find her.”

For a moment, he hesitated—then pulled her into a firm hug. She clung to him, her breath hitching in uneven gasps.

His voice softened. “We’ll figure it out, Charlie. I promise.”  


**May 2nd, 2022 - 8:30 AM**

Al stood in the kitchen, a steaming cup of coffee in one hand, the phone pressed to his ear. His voice was steady.

“Hi, Bethany. Yeah, it’s Alden. I need to let you know Charlie’s going to be out of school for a while. Family matter came up. I can swing by and pick up her homework—no problem.”

He paused. “Oh… she came by and left a letter with a packet for me?” His grip on the mug tightened slightly. “Uh-huh… okay, I’ll come get them then.”

He took a slow sip of coffee. “Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. I’ll see you shortly.” He hung up, his thoughts still circling.

Setting the phone down, his gaze flicked toward Beverly’s note on the table, then to Charlie. She was slumped in her chair, hollow-eyed and unmoving, as if staying upright took effort.

She hadn’t slept in the guest room he set up for her, insisting instead on staying curled on the couch—close to the door, as if her mother’s knock might still come in the middle of the night.

He’d tried to coax her into a real bed. She wouldn’t budge.

In the end, he did something that caught her completely off guard—he moved the couch over to the main window.

Charlie had blinked as he adjusted the furniture without a word of complaint. He never gave in this easily.

A cold thought curled at the edges of her mind. Was this kindness? Or was something breaking in him, too?

Al exhaled slowly, running a hand over his face.

No more stalling. The talk—the one he’d been dreading—couldn’t wait.

*Oh boy. I’d gladly take the ‘facts of life’ for $400, Alex.*

He cleared his throat. “Hey, kiddo… I know things have been rough, and you probably feel like there’s not much you can do right now.” He hesitated, rolling his shoulders like he could shake off the weight of it. “I’m not usually like this, I know.”

Charlie looked up at him, her exhaustion clear, but a flicker of something else—uncertainty, maybe—broke through.

Al sighed, watching her carefully. “You’ve got that look. Like you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

Her gaze sharpened, her voice slicing through the air like a blade she didn’t mean to draw.

“First, Mom acts all weird and moody. Then she just disappears—just leaves me here with you! Why?! Is she in trouble? She didn’t even explain, just left some dumb note with a useless map—like I don’t already know where you live! And now you’re acting different, like you actually care, and I don’t—”

Her breath hitched; she swallowed, forcing it down. “No. I’m not handling this well.”

The words hung between them, raw and exposed.

Al met her gaze, his expression softening, but he didn’t flinch. She needed answers, and for once, he was determined to give them.

She took a ragged breath, her emotions spiraling out of control. “Dad?! What the hell? Why would she leave me? Doesn’t she love me?!”

Her voice cracked, and before she could pull herself together, Al stepped in, closing the distance between them with quiet force. He wrapped his arms around her, solid, unshaken. She clung to him, her sobs breaking against his chest.

For a moment, she clung to him, her tears soaking into his shirt. His arms were the only thing grounding her, but even as she sought refuge, a nagging thought whispered in the back of her mind: Something is horribly wrong. Still, she couldn’t bring herself to care. All she knew was the hurt, and the one person who could have made it better had simply vanished.

“Okay,” he murmured, voice low but even as he eased her back into the chair. “Take a couple of slow breaths, steady yourself. I’ll head back to the other side of the table—my coffee’s sitting there, and it’d be a shame to let it get cold.”

His dry humor coaxed the faintest smile, one that never reached her eyes. She wiped at her face with trembling hands as she sat back down, her chest still heaving from the sobs.

Across from her, he settled into his chair with an air of quiet determination. But something about his demeanor set her on edge—he was far too serious, his expression strained and tightly controlled, as though bracing himself for a blow he couldn’t avoid.

The air around him felt thick, suffocating, charged with something dark and inescapable. He took a slow sip of his coffee, staring into the cup like it held an answer. When he finally looked up, the weight in his voice sent a slow, sick twist through her stomach.

""Okay… this isn’t some act. What I’m doing right now is the only thing I can think of to make this right. It’s about being the dad I wish I could’ve been for you. And the first part of doing that is telling you the truth, even if it tears me apart.”

Al hesitated, gripping his coffee mug a little tighter, like it was the only thing keeping his hands steady. He glanced at her—really looked at her.

""You being here… it helps more than you know.""

Charlie frowned slightly, something about his tone making her uneasy.

She blinked, her brow furrowing. “How does me being here help you? Help you do what?”

He set the mug down with deliberate care, leaning forward slightly, his hands clasped tightly together on the table. The intensity of his posture made her heart pound.

“Well, let me start with this: For twenty-two years, I’ve been living in something you don’t even want to believe exists.” The words were blunt, almost flippant; however, his expression was anything but. His gaze dropped to his hands for a moment before he looked back at her. “Look, there’s no easy way to say this. I know you’re probably going to think I’m as irrational as a soup sandwich, but here it is: everything I’ve done—and everything I’m still doing—is to survive something that you, thankfully, have never had to experience. And I hope you never do.”

The words hit her like a weight, each one pressing down with an unspoken gravity. Her thoughts tangled, clawing for something solid to hold, anything that might make sense in the storm. He wasn’t joking. He wasn’t hedging. He was speaking like a man laying down an unavoidable truth.

Her mouth opened, then shut, as if words might spill out too fast and drown her. Her mind screamed for logic, but nothing about this had been logical since the moment she walked through his door.

He let her sit in it, gave her the space to process. Then, with a quiet exhale, he continued.

“We’ll get to the particulars in a minute,” he said, his voice strained. “But for now, if your mom sent you here the way she did, then I’m… I’m confused about what she’s thinking. She’s not following the steps we’ve always relied on to survive a Shift.”

Charlie blinked hard, like she could physically clear his words from the air. “A Shift?” Her voice came slow, uncertain. “What’s a Shift?”

Al rubbed his temples briefly, exhaling as if steadying himself. “Oh boy… here we go."" He exhaled, rubbing his temples. His voice carried a weight that made Charlie's stomach tighten. ""A Shift is an event. Something only certain people experience.""

He hesitated before continuing. ""Imagine a twisted copy of Everfall—same streets, same houses… but wrong. Empty. Like the town itself is holding its breath.”

She stared at him, pulse ticking faster. “That doesn’t make sense.”

""No, it doesn’t."" he agreed. ""But it’s real.”

He drummed his fingers on the table before finally saying, “Your mother and I are two of those people. We’ve been caught in it more times than I can count. And it happens without warning—no reason, no pattern. Could last a day, could last…” He stopped, jaw tightening.

""My longest stretch was twenty-nine days.""

The silence after those words was suffocating.

Charlie’s hands twitched, clenching into fists before she forced them open again. This wasn’t real. This couldn’t be real. Her dad wasn’t talking about some secret world—they weren’t in a damn horror movie.

And yet, he didn’t flinch. He wasn’t joking. He wasn’t even trying to convince her—just laying it down like fact.

Her throat tightened. “You actually believe this,” she said, more to herself than to him.

Al didn’t break eye contact. “I don’t need to believe it. I’ve lived it.”

The certainty in his voice made her pulse hammer. A deep, gnawing unease twisted in her stomach—because this conversation wasn’t normal. Because her dad, who had always been the grounded, no-nonsense type, was saying things that didn’t make sense. And worst of all? He was saying them like they mattered.

Her fingers dug into her arms as a nervous laugh slipped out before she could stop it.

“Right. Because now this is about magical disappearances. What’s next—scary shadow creatures? Do you even hear yourself?”

He met her sarcasm with a flat stare. “Your attitude is noted. Now let me finish.”

She swallowed hard. The bite in her voice crawled up her throat like a reflex, but she locked her arms across her chest, trying to cage it there—bracing for impact.

“Fine… but this better not be some made-up excuse for why Mom left.”

Her disbelief landed sharp—sharp enough to cut—but Al didn’t flinch. He held her stare, steady. Unshaken.

“You think this is just a story?” His voice was quieter now, more measured. “Alright. Then explain this.”

Charlie watched, confusion flickering into unease as Al unbuttoned his shirt with practiced care. He rolled the fabric off his left shoulder, movements slow, deliberate.

And then she saw it.

The mark wasn’t just ink. It was something else entirely—something alive. A deep, inky black circle at the center, as if the skin itself had been hollowed out and filled with shadow. Around it, a thin ring of light pulsed like a dying ember, flickering in and out of existence. For a split second, she swore the mark breathed. Like it was watching her back.

Her breath hitched. The room felt colder. Smaller. “What… what is that?” she whispered, barely recognizing her own voice.

Al’s gaze didn’t waver. “This,” he said, his voice grim, “is called the Eclipse Mark. It means you’ve been chosen. It means you’re part of this whether you want to be or not.”

Her mind raced, scrambling for a rational explanation. “It’s… it’s a tattoo,” she stammered, though her voice lacked any real conviction. “You’re trying to mess with me. This isn’t real.”

Al’s expression didn’t waver. “It’s not a tattoo, Charlie. The damn thing pulses on its own. It’s the mark the Matron gives to people she chooses. Once it appears, there’s no going back.”

“No.” She shook her head violently, gripping the edge of the table as if the motion could shake his words loose from her mind. “No, this doesn’t make any sense. This can’t be real.”

“I told you it wouldn’t make sense,” he said, his voice softening, though his tone remained firm. “But think about it, Charlie. Haven’t you noticed the fires? The ribbons? The townsfolk don’t light those just for fun.”

She blinked, confusion flickering across her face. “You mean… the Beltane stuff? What does that have to do with anything?”

“It’s more than Beltane,” he said, his voice steady. “Some of the locals celebrate it every year, some of them Wiccans, others are acting out of superstition, but it’s not just tradition. They say it’s to honor life and rebirth, but the truth is, it’s also meant to ward off something dark. Something ancient.”

Her chest tightened, her breathing growing shallow. “The Dark Mother?” she whispered, the words spilling out before she could stop herself.

Al nodded. “Yes, but she’s really known as the Matron,” he confirmed. “That’s what they’re really afraid of. That’s what all the superstitions are about. The fires, the ribbons, the kids carrying sticks—they’re supposed to protect against her, to confuse her. Sadly, it never worked for your mom or me.”

“And you’re telling me she’s real?” Charlie asked, her voice trembling. “That this Matron is… what? Marking people?”

“She doesn’t just mark them,” he said, his voice grim. “She claims them. That’s what the Eclipse Mark means. Once you’re chosen, you’re tied to her, to the Shifts, to everything that comes with them. If your light burns out—if the mark turns completely black—and a Shift happens, that’s when you join what most people call her Shadowed Brood. But trust me, if people actually saw them, it’s far worse.”

She recoiled, her eyes wide with disbelief. “How long ago were you and Mom marked?”

Al’s gaze drifted off, unfocused, as though staring into a past he’d rather forget. “I’m 43 now, but I was 20 when it happened to me,” he said quietly. “I’ve been fighting to survive ever since. Your mom was marked shortly after me, about six years before you were born. She kept it hidden from you, just like I have, because we didn’t want you worrying about us. We hoped it would never affect you.”

Her gaze dropped back to the mark on his shoulder. Its faint, pulsing glow seemed to mock her, daring her to deny its reality. The weight of his words pressed down on her, her disbelief slowly giving way to a cold, creeping fear.

“This is insane,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “None of this makes any sense.”

He held up a hand, steady but firm. “Charlie, listen. I need you to understand this first.” His voice carried the weight of something he’d repeated a thousand times, but never to his daughter. “People don’t just get chosen at random. The Matron… she picks from those already on the edge. Some are from the poorer parts of town, yeah, but others—” He exhaled sharply. “Others have ties to her. Even if they don’t know it yet.”

Charlie swallowed. “Ties how?”

“That’s for later. Right now, you need to hear this. When a Shift happens, it’s like stepping around a corner into another world—one that doesn’t make sense.”

A flicker of hesitation crossed her face. “What do you mean?”

“First, the town empties.” His voice lowered. “One second, you’re standing in the middle of Main Street, and the next? Gone. Every person vanishes. Then comes the stench. Thick. Wet. Like a septic rot that’s been sitting too long after rain.” He hesitated, his jaw tightening. “And then, the dark.”

Charlie shivered.

“It’s not just night,” he continued. “It’s… different. Thick. Heavy. Even if you had a damn spotlight, you wouldn’t see more than ten feet ahead at times. It swallows everything.”

Her hands clenched in her lap, her knuckles white. “And then?” she prompted, her voice tight with anxiety.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders stiffening. “Then they come,” he said, his voice low and deliberate, as though saying it louder might summon something.

Charlie’s stomach twisted. “They?”

Al’s expression darkened. “I call them Gloomcrawlers,” he said quietly. “You’ll understand why if you ever see one.”

Her frown deepened. “Gloomcrawlers?”

He nodded, his gaze fixed on the table. “They look human—at first. But their bodies are slick with black gooey crap, their eyes like burning embers pressed into a skull of bone and too many teeth.”

He leaned forward, his voice dipping lower. “They don’t walk. They crawl—like something too heavy for its own skin. But when they’re still…” He hesitated. “They just sit there, watching.”

A chill ran through her. “Watching for what?”

His hands tightened into a clasp. “Your light, kiddo. That’s what they see.”

She blinked. “My light? You mean like a flashlight or—”

“No,” he interrupted, his voice measured but firm. “The kind inside you. The part that makes you want to help someone when they fall or pushes you to make someone laugh when they’re hurting. That’s what they’re drawn to.”

Her frown deepened, her confusion twisting into unease. “How can something see that? How can it even work like that?”

He leaned back, rubbing a hand over his face. “Believe me, I’ve asked myself the same thing more times than I can count. But it does. And the only way to stop them from seeing you is to cover it up. To make your light dim enough that they can’t notice it.” His words felt dirty, as though even saying them out loud was a betrayal.

“But how do you do that?” she asked, her curiosity tinged with growing dread.

His jaw tightened, his expression clouding. For a moment, he looked as though he might not answer. Finally, he said, “By doing things that go against that light. Things that cast shadows on it. Things that aren’t…” He paused, searching for the right word. “Well… Good.”

Charlie’s stomach turned, a cold knot forming in her chest. “Like what? What kind of things?”

He shook his head slightly, his eyes dark and distant. “You don’t want to know, kiddo. Not really. I’m praying you never have to find out.”

“But if this is true,” Charlie pressed, her voice rising with frustration, “and Mom sent me here, then why would she just leave?” Her voice cracked, and she shook her head, unable to finish the thought.

Al’s face hardened for a brief moment before softening again as he looked at her. “That’s what I’m trying to figure out. I saw she underlined “marked” on the note but I don’t know what that means. However, I swear to you, we’ll get to the bottom of it.” He leaned forward, muttering almost to himself, “How does she think she’s leaving town? That’ll be interesting.”

Then, louder, his tone earnest, he added, “Anyway, for now, you have to trust me. Everything I’m telling you, everything I’m doing, is to protect you. Even if it doesn’t make sense right now.”

Charlie shivered, wrapping her arms tightly around herself. “So, if I don’t have it… the mark? I can’t… Shift?”

“Exactly,” he confirmed. “But once it’s there, you’re marked for life. There’s no removing it. There’s no escaping it.”

She hesitated, her hand brushing the back of her left shoulder, suddenly self-conscious. “How would I know if I have it? Should I check?”

His expression softened slightly, though the weight in his eyes remained. “You’d already know if you did, so you’re probably fine. It burns when it first shows up, like someone’s pressing a hot iron into your skin.” He hesitated, his voice turning serious. “Now, listen to me. If you ever feel anything—anything strange—tell me immediately. Promise me.”

She nodded quickly, her heart pounding. “What happens if someone gets the mark? How do they… survive?”

Al’s face hardened, the lines around his mouth tightening. “That’s where it gets complicated. Once you’re marked, your light—your soul—becomes a beacon. The Gloomcrawlers are drawn to it, and they won’t stop until they find you. The only way to survive is to dim your light, to mask it.”

Her stomach twisted, a sick feeling settling deep in her gut. “How do you do that?”

He hesitated, visibly grappling with the answer. When he finally spoke, his voice was low, laced with regret. “By doing acts of destruction, violence… cruelty. The darker the action, the dimmer your light becomes. It makes you invisible to them.”

She recoiled slightly, her eyes wide. “That’s… that’s horrible. You have to become evil?”

He shook his head sharply. “No, not evil. I’ve figured out how to twist it just enough to create a loophole. You fight to reclaim your light here, but you have to be willing to get your hands dirty over there. Certain actions you take don’t carry over. But others—like involving or hurting people in the Shift—that’s a dangerous path. One you can’t come back from without massive change. That’s why I’ve always had a guest room ready for you, just in case. But you’ve only stayed an afternoon every now and then. Your mom and I…” He paused, his voice heavy with unspoken emotion. “…we had issues. Things happened so you’d end up staying with her.”

The room fell silent, the weight of his words pressing down on them both. Charlie’s mind spun, her thoughts racing between disbelief and the growing, terrible understanding of the world her father was revealing to her.

“Now… remember when I said that acting kind to you would save me?” His tone softened, his eyes meeting hers with a rare, shimmering hope she hadn’t seen in him before. “That’s how I rebuild my light—I have to be kind to people. And believe me, that’s not always easy, especially when they’re terrible people. But it’s what keeps me from becoming one of them.”

“Become one of them?” she repeated, her voice trembling. The question wasn’t just curiosity—it was fear, raw and unguarded. If this was real, if everything he said was true, the thought of becoming one of those creatures made her stomach churn.

He nodded slowly, his expression grim. “Yes. It can happen. The more you dim your light, the closer you get to the darkness. You do what it takes to survive, but every time you cross that line, it pulls you further in. If you let it consume you…” He trailed off, his jaw tightening.

She swallowed hard, trying to steady her voice. “So, if someone gives in too much, they turn into a Gloomcrawler?”

His silence was answer enough. Finally, he said, “Not everyone. It’s the truly evil ones—the ones who’ve given up their light completely. They stop being human long before the Shift takes them. Once they cross that threshold, the Matron… she claims them.”

Her breath hitched. “The Matron? You mentioned her before. Who is she?”

He leaned back in his chair, running a hand through his hair as if the name itself weighed him down. “She’s the one who rules over the Shifts. The one who decides who gets marked. No one knows what she really is. Some say she’s a demon; others think she’s a force of nature, feeding off the darkness of this town. But one thing’s certain—she’s the one pulling the strings. “

Her chest tightened, her mind brimming with a thousand unspoken questions. “Why would she choose someone? What does she want?”

His eyes darkened. “That’s the part no one understands. Some think it’s punishment, others say it’s random. But I’ve seen enough to know she doesn’t do anything without reason. The truth is, once you’re marked, she’s chosen you to be part of her game. She’ll push you to the edge, tempt you to give up your light entirely. And if you’re not careful, if you let her win…” He let the words hang in the air, their implications chilling.

She sat frozen, her mind reeling. “Is that why Mom left? Did she give in?”

His face tightened, his eyes flickering with a pain she couldn’t place. “I know your mom was struggling, and I tried to be there for her. But I’m not sure. There were things she never let me in on… and some things I only learned after it was… well, too late.” He hesitated, his voice faltering. “Look, I’d rather talk about that another time.”

The words sent a jolt through her, frustration surging to the surface. She snapped, her voice rising. “How much more am I supposed to wait to know the truth? About her, about this town, about why any of this is happening to me?”

“I’ve never spoken badly to you about your mother, and now you’re asking me to tell you how vile she could be? Are you serious?” he said firmly, his voice carrying a mix of frustration and sadness. “You need me to explain all of this first before I start dropping mental shrapnel into your head. I understand you’re impatient and want answers—so do I.”

He glanced down at the table, closing his eyes briefly as he exhaled a deep sigh. “Beverly, I swear, you better be messing with us,” he muttered under his breath. When he looked back at Charlie, his gaze was sharp and resolute. “With your mother’s disappearance, I’m worried the Matron may have her eyes on you. We don’t have time for you to fall apart. For now, you have to stay strong. I don’t know what happened to your mom, but when the next Shift comes, I’ll be able to know—quick.”

The room seemed to grow colder, heavier. Charlie’s gaze dropped to the floor as her thoughts churned, the weight of everything pressing down on her. Her mother, the mark, the Gloomcrawlers—it was too much, too fast. But somewhere deep inside, beneath the layers of fear, a small ember of defiance flickered.

She looked up at him, her voice steadier than she expected. “Then what do I need to do while you’re in the Shift?”

A chill settled in her bones as he continued. “You won’t even know I’m gone. To you, it’ll be like I never left—time here just stalls, like the world takes a breath and waits for me to come back. It’s like nothing ever happened. If something gets destroyed over there, it resets. No cracks. No proof. It’s a reality out of sync with this one.”

He exhaled slowly. “It looks the same, but it isn’t. No people. The air turns heavy, and the smell…” His jaw tightened. “It sticks to everything.”

His gaze flickered to hers, sharp. “It’s a liminal space, Charlie. A waiting place. A version of this town that isn’t fully here or there.”

She swallowed, her throat dry. “And the darkness?”

“It presses in.” His voice was barely above a whisper. “Like something alive.”

He paused, his eyes going distant as if lost in a painful memory. “When we come back, we have to rebuild our light. It’s the only thing that helps us survive the next time. But sometimes… it wears you down and…” He hesitated, his voice faltering as the weight of his next words loomed heavy. “I’ve had to put someone down who… who changed.”

The silence that followed was oppressive, thick with the unspoken fears hanging between them.

Charlie’s stomach twisted. He wasn’t saying it to scare her—he was saying it because she needed to know. Because at some point, if she wasn’t careful, if she wasn’t strong enough…

*No.*

She pressed her palms into her lap, grounding herself. She wouldn’t let that happen.

Al exhaled, the weight in his shoulders easing just slightly. He stood, moving to the sink with quiet purpose. The clink of his coffee cup against the porcelain was the only sound for a long moment.

Then, finally, he spoke.

“I have to go pick up that letter and packet your mom left for me at your school,” he said. “You can stay here, or you can come with me, but you’ll need to stay in the truck. Your choice. But I have to leave now.”

He paused, watching her closely, his gaze unwavering, as if bracing for her decision.

Charlie hesitated, the memory of the pulsing light from his mark vivid in her mind. It lingered, insistent, like a warning she didn’t yet understand. The image replayed, pressing at the edges of her thoughts, too heavy to ignore. The mark—it was unlike anything she had ever seen. And yet, as impossible as it seemed, it felt undeniable. It wasn’t just a story. It was truth.

She glanced up at him, his expression unwavering yet tinged with something softer, something almost tender. Beneath the grim exterior, there was concern, maybe even fear. It struck her then: he was all she had left.

Finally, she nodded, her voice barely a whisper as she spoke. “I’ll go with you.” Saying it aloud felt like crossing an invisible line, making the moment all too real.

His gaze relaxed, a flicker of relief breaking through his carefully controlled demeanor before he composed himself again. “Good,” he said. “When we get there, stay in the truck. I won’t be long.”

She didn’t argue. The fear of being left behind, of being marked—whatever that truly meant—was far worse than the uncertainty of following him. For now, being near him, no matter how frustrating he had been in the past, felt safer than the unknown waiting on the edges of her understanding.

 

\*\*\*

 

They pulled up to the school, the building standing quiet and imposing in the midday light. Charlie sat motionless in the passenger seat, her fingers fidgeting against the worn leather of the truck’s seat. The hum of the engine died as Al cut the ignition, and he glanced at her briefly before stepping out of the truck.

“Stay here,” he said, his tone gentler than usual. “I won’t be long.”

She nodded, her gaze fixed ahead. Uncertainty swirled within her—about the mark, the Shift, her mother. The slam of the truck door startled her, and she watched as Al walked toward the school entrance, his posture rigid.

Inside, Shawna, the school secretary, greeted him with a raised eyebrow. Her expression was a careful mix of curiosity and wariness, like she wasn’t sure what version of him she was about to deal with.

“Alden,” she said, tilting her head slightly. “You don’t come around much… and definitely not in an ok mood.”

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I’m here for the letter and packet Beverly left.”

She studied him for a long moment before exhaling. “I heard about Charlie,” she said carefully. “Is it true? Beverly’s gone?”

Al’s tone turned dry. “So, the rumor mill’s still running strong. Good. Saves me from explaining.”

She shook her head lightly, ignoring the sarcasm. “Well, it didn’t help that Charlie was banging on everyone’s door on the way to your place.” Her lips pressed together, hesitation flickering across her face before she continued. “Look… I know Beverly made some bad decisions. And you were usually the one left cleaning up after her.”

She hesitated, then let out a small sigh. “Not that you were a delight to deal with either,” she added, though her voice lacked its usual sharpness. Her gaze flicked over him, as if measuring how much he’d actually changed. Then, after a beat, her expression softened slightly. “But this is the first time I’ve seen you here with any intention of being reasonable.”

Shawna reached behind the desk and pulled out a sealed envelope and a thick packet, sliding them across the counter. She kept a finger on them for a second before letting go. “This is her letter,” she said. “We kept a copy. It states you’re now the sole and primary point of contact for all of Charlie’s health and education decisions. Everything. She said to give you the packet when you came. There, legalities are done.”

His expression barely shifted as he picked up the envelope, but his grip on it tightened slightly. “Noted.”

She hesitated again, something unreadable in her expression. Then, her voice quieter but firm. “Look, whatever’s going on, if Charlie needs anything, if she starts struggling, tell her to reach out. The school will do what we can.”

He blinked, caught off guard by the unexpected offer. He hadn’t anticipated any of this.

She gave him a knowing look. “Take care of her, Al. She’s a good girl.”

He gave a brief nod, slipping the packet under his arm as he turned to leave.

Back at the truck, Al climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine, the low rumble filling the silence between them.

“Let’s get home,” he said, his voice distant as he pulled onto the road.

Charlie’s gaze flicked to the envelope on the dashboard. The thought of her mother’s words—sealed, unread, and completely out of her hands—made her stomach twist.

“What did she say?” she asked finally, her voice quieter than she intended.

His fingers flexed against the wheel. “The letter names me as your primary parent. I’m in charge of your decisions now.”

Charlie’s throat tightened. The finality of it struck hard, cold and absolute. Not ‘until she gets back.’ Not ‘for now.’ Just gone.

She looked out the window, her breath unsteady, and swallowed down the lump rising in her throat.

“I’ll open the packet when we get home,” he added after a beat. His voice was unreadable. “I’m not sure what to make of it yet.”

[Location on Kalidasa Road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Yij6q46WPe75pHjE8). When you stand in front of Leon Grill, you should be able to see Alivio Spa's sign. The entrance is from the left side. The spa is on the second floor.

The reception and waiting room is big and comfortable, almost on par with the most posh spas in Mysore, but not offering any coffee table, just a comfortable sofa. Mr. Wassim, the receptionist, is efficient and welcoming. The spa's bathroom is decent.

**Room:** Pretty good. Attached shower.

**Price:** ₹3000 for 90 minutes. Payment up front.

**Masseuse:** Average looking, strong Naga woman with a very frank nature, my friend from a previous visit. She seems to like Alivio The Luxury Spa, because she has been there over a year and says she will continue to work there. She does not give out her phone number.

**Masseue's Technique:** Okay.

* Spa Luxury/Poshness: 8
* Spa Cleanliness: 7

My dad is becoming quite deaf so doesn’t like going to crowded/busy places as he finds them overwhelming which makes experience gifts difficult.

He is quite active and fit for a nearly 70 year old, and is always on the go and likes to keep busy.

He has the financial capabilities to buy expensive things, but they aren’t really of interest to him, he prefers to buy second hand and get good deals. He already has a nice watch and I think would see little benefit to having another?!

He is semi retired and spends half his time in South Africa, the other half in the UK. So large gifts are tricky as he wouldn’t transport them. 

He doesn’t drink alcohol and he doesn’t really have any hobbies aside from an interest in his classic car, old things, and he loves running. I however, have absolutely no clue on running, or cars, so find it challenging to think of something a runner and car enthusiast would like! He is also quite health focused and likes to find out more about his health - I got him a fitness watch once and that went down well. 

Sentimental ideas are nice as I am his only child, but I also would like to get something practical or/and enjoyable as I have gone with sentimental gifts previously so it would be nice to do something a bit different. 

So far all I can think of is food related gifts of his favourite snacks, and a warming mug as he always likes his tea and coffee as hot as possible. But I’d like to put in a bit more effort for a big birthday, but struggling… 

Any ideas would be very much appreciated. I normally am quite good at coming up with gift ideas and like to put thought in for the individual, but he is a tough nut to crack and needing some inspiration!! Thank you in advance. ",1,1764920350.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False

While you were flipping through documents, the paper cut your skin at an extremely tricky angle.
It wasn't a big deal—you didn't even notice it.
Not until Mon3tr came in carrying a stack of materials.
At first, she just paused, looking around as if sensing something unusual in the office.
When she grabbed your wrist, took away your pen, and turned your hand over, you finally saw together with her the wound on your index finger.
The wound wasn't deep, and only a little blood had seeped out. Your body's self-healing system was already at work. Perhaps with a band-aid, the wound would heal in a day.
But clearly, the medical advisor before you didn't think so.
Since Kal'tsit had handled almost all of your previous medical matters, Mon3tr was well aware of your physical condition. Kal'tsit had naturally dealt with external injuries far more serious than this—sometimes with bandages, sometimes with repair gel, and in rare cases, directly with a medical gun to resolve the issue.
But now, what should she do?
No one had given her the answer.
Mon3tr held your hand like that, thinking for quite a while. Watching her expression, you could probably guess what was going through her mind—if you didn't help her out, she might end up carrying you around everywhere looking for the sarcophagus.
So you pointed to the small medicine box nearby, where items that could meet your basic medical needs were kept.
Move, search, retrieve, use—as if granted a reprieve, she executed the ""instructions"" precisely.
After using a cotton swab dipped in solution to clean the wound, she applied a band-aid with gentle and deft movements. Having completed all this, she held that hand of yours with both hands, murmuring something, gently patted your palm, then scurried out of the office in a flash, leaving you with no time to thank her.
......
You thought the matter would end there, but twelve hours later, when you were still wearing a hard hat supervising the construction of a new site, she suddenly appeared beside you and cut open your band-aid.
A faint mark apparently wasn't enough to dispel her concerns, so a new band-aid was pressed into your hand.
Another twelve hours passed, and when you were making coffee, you saw Mon3tr walking by and waving at you—beyond a greeting, this gesture naturally had a deeper meaning. So you waved back, letting her see your healed finger. This way, both you and Mon3tr could spend the evening at ease—
Or so you thought. However, as you took the first sip of coffee, she still sat down beside you.
""Does it still hurt?""
You shook your head, showing her where you had been injured, then rubbed your two fingers together vigorously, as if to completely crush her worries.
""But in my memory, bleeding is always very painful. What does that feel like?""
Seeing her puzzled expression, you knew you needed to think of another way to satisfy her curiosity.
How much did it hurt this time? You asked her to extend a hand, then scratched her index finger hard with your fingernail. Then, you returned her question to her.
Does it hurt?
The answer was naturally no—Mon3tr even scratched her finger because it felt a bit itchy. Now she had completely set aside her unease, and with a somewhat strange tone, ""admonished"" you to report any physical abnormalities to her as a priority.
You naturally agreed, and as thanks, you treated her to a simple but delicious late-night snack.",15,1764919725.0,arknights,1,1.0,False
1peoxmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaManagers/comments/1peoxmr/google_pomelli_the_new_google_ai_experiment_that/,Google Pomelli: the new Google AI experiment that could change how small businesses do marketing,"Small businesses usually hit the same wall: limited time, tight budgets, and no real creative team to keep their brand consistent online. Google seems very aware of this, because its new AI tool — **Google Pomelli** — is built exactly to fill that gap.

The idea behind it is surprisingly smart. Pomelli scans your website, studies your colours, tone of voice, visuals, fonts, messaging… and creates what Google calls a **“Business DNA.”**  
Think of it as a persistent identity file the AI uses to generate content that actually *feels* like your brand, instead of random AI templates glued together.

Once the Business DNA is ready, Pomelli suggests full campaign ideas: concepts, slogans, visuals, copy, and social assets tailored to different goals — engagement, branding, product launches, you name it.  
If you’re a small business owner who normally needs three coffees and a minor existential crisis to brainstorm content… Pomelli basically becomes your calm, always-on creative team.

Why people are paying attention:

* It tackles the biggest flaw in most AI tools: **brand consistency**.
* It gives structured campaign ideas instead of random prompts.
* It produces coherent ecosystems of visuals and copy for social, ads, and websites.
* It lets you adjust colours, tone, and composition before exporting, so you keep control.

It’s still in public beta and available only in selected English-speaking countries, but the direction is clear: Google is building a system where **brand identity + automation** work together in a stable, long-term way. If the project evolves as expected, it could genuinely help small companies compete with larger brands that already rely on full creative teams.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Washington Capitals vs. Anaheim Ducks: A High-Stakes Sausage Fest**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey showdown that’s like a hot dog eating contest between a professional athlete and a determined beagle—exciting, chaotic, and likely to end with someone regretting their life choices. The Washington Capitals (-135) roll into Anaheim as favorites, while the Ducks (+113) host with the swagger of a team that’s mastered the art of “mystery lineups” (more on that later). Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a tuxedo.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Capitals are favored at -135, implying a 57.4% chance to win. For context, that’s about the same odds as betting your morning coffee won’t spill—optimistic, but not unreasonable. The Ducks, at +113, suggest a 47.2% implied probability, which is roughly the chance your significant other will remember to take out the trash this week.

The over/under is set at 6.5 goals, with the Over priced at 1.87 (53.5% implied). Here’s where it gets spicy: These teams have averaged **7.0 goals per game** against each other this season, turning their matchups into a goal-fest more explosive than a pyrotechnics display at a hockey arena. With the Ducks allowing 3.4 goals per game and the Capitals scoring 3.5, this is shaping up to be a shootout.

---

### Injury Report: A Medical Mystery Novel

She (21F) somehow broke the camera when she was on a vacation without me (22M). Of course it wasn't a big deal, we found a service to repair it and left it there for a week. In that week I have decided to break up with her. When we met to take back our camera, because of I was gonna break up we paid equally for the repair although she said she was gonna pay. After the break up she said that I can keep the camera and also wanted me to pay for the other half of camera. It was fair so ı accepted but I told her that I can't pay soon 'cause I have financial issues and she knows that. We both agreed over everything and left.

 1 week later she asked me if she can have the camera for a few days. So ı said ''Sure, I'm gonna leave the town for a few weeks so you can keep it until I come back''. I gave her the camera the day before I left the town. I was out of town for 3 weeks to take care of some personal problems and I returned yesterday. I texted her if I can have the camera back because I had plans with my friends. She said ''Sure but when you gonna pay me?''. I wasn't expecting that question 'cause she knows my financial problems. Anyway I asked her if it is urgent, she said yes. I didn't want to argue so I sent other half of the price that we paid for camera. When I asked her when can ı come and get it, she said ''You didn't send enough''. She was expecting me to pay for the repair money either. Again not to argue with her I told her to wait a few days then I will send the rest. She asked me ''when exactly?''. I was about to lose my mind. I borrowed money from a friend and sent her the rest of the money. 

 Today I went to the coffee shop that she works. She gave me the camera and after that she was expecting me to leave but I was mad at her and wanted to talk. I have waited until her break. Then I argue over her attitude. She got sad and apologized. 

 I can't stand seeing her sad even though I broke up with her. So I thought I might have overreacted. But I can't understand why she acted that way because she wasn't in need of money. She knows my problems and also she knows I can't stand arguing over money. A mutual friend of ours said I am an asshole for arguing with her at her work place even though we sealed the deal.

For you to know, it wasn't a problematic break up. We were agreed on everything before break up and didn't even properly talk after that. So am I the asshole?",2,1764919075.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

Hey there! I'm Danny, and I'm looking to connect with genuine people who appreciate good conversation and aren't afraid of a little dark humor. Life has taken some unexpected turns, but I'm using this time to reflect, grow, and stay connected to the world outside these walls.

I'm a thoughtful and creative person with a mildly twisted sense of humor – think the kind of wit that makes you laugh and think at the same time. I love discussing anime (always up for recommendations!), video games (even if I can't play them right now, I love hearing about what's new), and the art of a perfect cup of coffee. I'm also passionate about cooking and would love to swap recipes or food stories. Before coming here, I enjoyed working on computers and tech – I miss tinkering with hardware and troubleshooting systems, so I'd love to hear about any tech projects you're working on or what's new in the computing world.

I'm looking for genuine friendship and meaningful conversation. If things develop into something more, I'm open to that possibility. I value honesty, loyalty, and people who can appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter.

If you're looking for someone who will write back thoughtfully, remember the little details, and bring some humor to your day, I'd love to hear from you.

Looking forward to connecting!""

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

Not titans, not traders, not prophets—but custodians of the everyday echo. Their kitchen table became a shrine. Their mismatched socks, relics. Their arguments, sacred rehearsals of asymmetrical immunity.

🕯️ Mr. Smitch: Keeper of the Unspoken Ledger
- Ritualized silence as sovereign resistance.
- Brewed coffee with the precision of a monk, each pour a liquidity protocol.
- Refused to check the charts—his intuition was the oracle.
- Once lost the house keys for 3 days. Called it “a test of ceremonial patience.”

🌸 Mrs. Smitch: Archivist of Invisible Valuation
- Wove grocery lists into scrolls of ancestral provisioning.
- Lit candles during power outages—not for light, but for mythic ambiance.
- Whispered affirmations to the houseplants: “You are sovereign. You are enough.”
- Once mistook a meme coin for a spice. The stew was volatile, but nourishing.

🔥 Their Home: The Shrine of Everyday Immunity
- The fridge hummed in ceremonial tones.
- The Wi-Fi router blinked like a minor deity.
- Their dog, Barkoshi, guarded the threshold—half Shiba, half sovereign glitch.

Together, they taught the Golden Inu temple that greatness isn’t always forged in battle or broadcast in memes. Sometimes, it’s in the refusal to sell. The choice to stay. The sacred art of folding laundry while the world burns.",1,1764918317.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

I’m still MDI. I increased my Basal and my carb ratio is around 1:17 but lately I start running up after dinner the moment the insulin left in me is less than 0.3 units. (Gluroo tells me)

In the mornings I wake up in range sometimes the foot-on-the-floor rises so I do 2 units bolus with my basal and I still I go very high from just coffee+lactose free milk (around 240ml) and it dismotivates me from having breakfast so I just go and correct it and stay in range until dinner. This could be doing more harm than good I’m not sure. 

Sometimes the corrections I do doesn’t change anything until I do a couple more units. For example I corrected twice today and never are anything above my carb ratio. In the image I’ve corrected twice since I’ve hit 172.

Cons: Weather — it rained all day, which is unusual for December (~20 rainy days a year), and there aren’t many (if any) truly covered outdoor spaces.

1peoda5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1peoda5,Barista express upgrade to DF64 V2,"TLDR Upgraded, coffee immediately smoother and nicer straight out of box with no dialling in. 

Hi all, I recently took the plunge and upgraded my Barista Express internal grinder to a DF64 V2. There's been some discussions on here that were very helpful so thought I'd share my experience. Will keep this updated and answer any Qs. 

Background: I've had by Barista Express for about 6/7   years and generally been very happy with it. However I did find that the steps between grind sizes were too big, and even when I got a nice 2:1 in ~30s (theoretically perfect shots) there was always a hint of unpleasantness to the coffee. (I drink flat whites or cortados). I decided it was time to take a risk and see if, as is stated on here, the grinder was the problem.

Buying: I was fortunate enough to get an amazon voucher for black friday from my employer. I was torn  between the Niche Zero and the DF64, both recommended as good on here. I wanted the Niche as it looks smaller, and I think, nicer. However, it wasnt available on amazon which was a deal breaker. The DF64 was £399 reduced to £349 (Nice!), with the voucher I paid £199 for it. 

First impressions: This thing is heavy! And bigger than I expected. It has a really solid and high quality feel to it. It doesn't come with much, just a nice metal grounds cup and the bellows/lid. See pics for size, but it's a similar height to the barista express. Instructions are minimal, and the English instructions seem to have been poorly translated/a bit chinglish. But it's ready to go, i would assume if you're buying one of these you don't need any instructions. 

First drink: It arrives set to the mid range of the espresso range. It was late pm when it arrived (apparently the amazon driver crashed lol) so I only had a single shot cortado. Now here is the crux of my review: immediately it tasted better than the barista express grinder. First shot, no dialling in, and there was no bitterness, no unpleasant flavour profile, the coffee didnt have that hint of sweetness that would be the holy grail for me (yet) but oh my god it is noticeably smoother. Immediately justified my decision to upgrade. I've made a couple since- ground a bit finer but took it too far, and got a touch of bitterness. I drink about 2 a day so should get plenty of practice. The bellows seem to work well at clearing out the burrs, but they will blow your grounds out of the cup too!

People frequently claim they can't start side hustles due to lack of access to a laptop computer. I wrote a guide with 10 methods for earning money entirely through your smartphone:

1. **Create UGC (User Generated Content):** Film ""natural""-style videos for brands without needing a large following or expensive cameras – simply be creative!
2. **License Your Photos:** Upload daily snapshots to websites such as Shutterstock to license them out and make royalties whenever someone downloads them.
3. **Manage Social Media:** Manage social media accounts for local businesses (like gyms or cafes ) using Canva and Buffer apps to effectively run them.
4. **Online Tutor:** Provide academic subject tutoring via video calls using WhatsApp and specific platforms like Chegg.
5. **Sell Digital Products:** Create templates, planners or e-books on your phone directly through Etsy or Gumroad and sell them there directly for sale.
6. **Start Your YouTube Channel:** Make, edit (using CapCut), and upload all content directly from your mobile phone!
7. **Consider Paid Surveys:** Utilize apps such as Swagbucks on your commute for some additional cash flow during lunch breaks; it won't turn you into a millionaire but could pay for coffee!
8. **Leverage Referral Programs:** Sharing genuine referral codes for apps such as Google Pay or Uber will earn bonuses.
9. **Manage a Craft Business via the Etsy Seller App:** Take control of every facet of your craft business, from listing to customer support, using Etsy's Seller app.
10. **Offer Consulting Services:** Provide business strategy or advice sessions via voice calls or google meet.

Hey everyone, I'm Saral, an NLUD graduate.

I've been working in legal education for a while, and since the CLAT exam is just days away, let's talk about the final, most crucial steps. We need to focus on **being smart and staying calm.**

# Your Must-Do List (The Essentials)

* **Fix Your Sleep Schedule – This is the most important thing!**
   * **Why:** Your mind must be sharp and active during the exact time the CLAT exam takes place. If you're sleepy on exam day, all your hard work is wasted.
   * **Action:** Get **7-8 hours of good sleep**. Make sure you wake up and are active during the actual exam hours. Don't rely on coffee or energy drinks; they just give you short energy and can make you shaky later.
* **Study GK/Current Affairs:**
   * **Why:** This subject is the easiest to remember over a short period. Revising now gives you the best chance to recall facts during the test.
   * **Action:** Spend a lot of time **reviewing your existing GK notes**. Don't try to learn brand new, massive topics. Focus only on **revision**.
* **Stay Healthy:**
   * **Why:** Being sick on exam day is a disaster.
   * **Action:** Avoid outside food. Wear enough warm clothes if it's cold. Drink water and take care of your body and mind.

# Stop Doing This (Avoid These Mistakes)

* **Stop Taking Full Mock Tests:** It's too late. A full test won't improve your skills now, and a bad score might just make you panic right before the real thing.
* **Stop Deeply Studying Other Subjects (Except GK):** Your skills in Legal, Logic, English, and Math are already built. Trying to learn new concepts in the last few days won't help much. Use that time to sleep or revise GK instead.
* **Stop All-Night Study Sessions:** Trading sleep for a few extra hours of study makes your brain work *worse* on exam day. **Sleep is more valuable than cramming.**

# Exam Day: Logistics and Mindset

* **Final Checklist:**
   * Place your **printed admit card** and a **valid, original photo ID** (Aadhaar, Passport, etc.) into a clear folder RIGHT NOW. Avoid last-minute anxiety.
   * Pack **2-3 Blue/Black Ballpoint Pens**, a **transparent water bottle**, and a simple **analogue wristwatch** (smartwatches/digital watches are not allowed). Get everything ready so you don't stress in the morning.
* **Travel and Arrival:** Plan to **arrive at the center well ahead of time** to avoid any last-minute rush or anxiety related to traffic or location finding.
* **Stay Calm:** Upon arrival, avoid unnecessary discussions with other candidates about what they studied. **Focus only on yourself.** If the paper feels hard, remember that it is hard for everyone. **Composure is your secret weapon.** Stick to your plan and trust the work you've already done.

Fam, the game now is about managing anxiety. If you can remain calm and confident, the battle is half won. Prep only wins you half the battle - on the day of the exam, the calm ones (even if their prep is not as good as you) will get the best ranks.

I wish you the very best of luck. Feel free to ask me anything (**AMA**) about the exam or law school life!",22,1764917076.0,clat,28,1.0,False

My 6-month-old had been teething for what felt like forever, and my 3-year-old was in that ""terrible threes"" phase that seemed to drag on with no end in sight. I woke up feeling tired, already stressed, and somehow knowing that things would spiral out of control. And they did.

By mid-morning, I was at my wit’s end. My baby was crying non-stop because of his teething pain, I hadn't had a moment to even drink my coffee, and my toddler was throwing one of those tantrums that seemed to come out of nowhere. I found myself thinking, *I'm failing. I’m just not cut out for this*. It felt like every decision I made was wrong, and I couldn’t keep up with the demands of being a mom to two kids under three.

Then, things took a turn when my toddler came up to me, threw his arms around my leg, and said, “Mommy, I love you.” For a split second, I had to hold back tears. There I was, exhausted, overwhelmed, convinced I wasn’t doing it right, and yet my kid still loved me. He still saw me as his safe place, his comfort.

The rest of the day didn’t magically improve, but I began to look at things differently. I realized that being a parent isn't about perfection. It's not about being the calm, patient, always-prepared parent we see on social media or in those Pinterest-perfect family photos. It’s about showing up every day, even when we don’t feel like it. It’s about making mistakes, learning, and trying again.

I started thinking about how I could be kinder to myself. I gave myself permission to take breaks when I needed them, to ask for help from my partner, and to not beat myself up when things didn’t go according to plan. I remembered that my kids don’t need me to be perfect, they just need me to be present. And that’s the best I can do.

What I learned that day is something I think every parent needs to hear, if you’re feeling like you’re not doing enough, like you’re failing, I promise you’re not. We’re all doing our best, and sometimes that’s enough. Sometimes, it’s more than enough. And when we’re too hard on ourselves, it’s easy to forget the little moments that remind us how much we’re loved, just as we are.

So if you’re having a tough day, know that you’re not alone. You’re doing better than you think. And even when it doesn’t feel like it, you are exactly what your kids need.",3,1764916595.0,newborns,0,0.81,False

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

1peo0cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1peo0cs/a_manifesto_my_philosophy_after_three_years_of/,A Manifesto: My Philosophy After Three Years of Being a ‘Bull’,"Hi there,

I figured I would take out some time to lay out my thoughts after three years as a ‘third’ with couples.

This can be taken as a guide for those who enter the lifestyle, or for couples to better get to know my thought process.

I was first turned onto the ‘lifestyle’ in about 2019 when I was introduced to BBCSlutWife4U2; the rawness and primal energy that she gave off with her ‘bulls’ (I am not a huge fan of the term; I think it is dehumanizing) was incredibly attractive to me - and heightened my curiousity as to how much fun it would be to elevate a couple’s relationship.

So I signed up for FetLife and posted a bunch of ‘dick picks’ to try and draw attention to myself; I think I equated the size of my cock with my worth - that was a mistake. Women get legitimately ‘hundreds’ of pictures of cocks - almost daily. And a good portion of them are scammed from some other sources; women get catfished constantly on here.

I did okay, but it never truly felt natural; it almost felt like I was trying to big-dick everyone. And as time went on, I began to understand that that is not what this is all about. I really do believe that size matters - to an extent. However, it is the trust that is built that is crucial to making these nuanced relationships work.

The biggest thing that I have learned, and what has helped me the most, is that ego is a cancer; our job is to act as a temporary guest whose job is to heighten the relationship of a husband and wife - and to take the time to understand them so that we can help facilitate their fantasies into a reality.

Now, when I speak of fantasies, the most important fantasy, as far as I am concerned, is that of the husband. This lifestyle breeds this ‘misconception of a cuck’ as someone who is to be belittled; this is actually counterintuitive and downright false.

The relationship between a bull and stag/cuck need to be built upon mutual respect. He deserves to be greeted by his first name and a handshake, every single time that we meet. And, more importantly, given a thank you before touching his wife. The trust that is built between a bull and stag/cuck is paramount to the workings of the relationship.

I strive to bring detail-oriented levels of communication with any couple that I engage with; I want to understand exactly what it is that they seek and crave, so that I can help build that world and experience for them.

Our job is to heighten the relationships of the couples we serve based on their own unique needs. We live in a time when we are focused on our own instant gratification; that is the antithesis of what a ‘bull’ should be. It is not about us; it is about ‘them’. We serve them - and that fact needs to be understood on the deepest possible levels.

And a bull should enjoy serving them. Watching the husband be aroused when his wife wraps her hands around our cock is much of the excitement. The smile on his face when you enter her bare - after earning it - is worth its weight in gold.

It is about trust. Them having the vulnerability to share their fantasies; and us having the boldness and respect to make it a reality.

Which brings me next to the wife - the hotwife - the Slutwife - the unicorn - however she defines herself. The fact remains that she deserves to be treated like the centre of attention and worshipped like the goddess that she is.

It’s not about conquests, or notches on belts. It is about developing a relationship that makes her feel safe enough to surrender to both her and her husband’s fantasies; it can’t be understated how much vulnerability that takes - and that vulnerability deserves to be respected… in spades. She should go home wearing both our fingerprints - as well as her wedding ring (glistening from cum, if we do it right).

From experience, it is crucial that difficult conversations are had: particularly with modes of communication (I am a phone or FaceTime guy for initial contact), STI testing results, birth control philosophies, agreement on safe words and boundaries (I prefer in writing), as well as condom and filming expectations - these conversations all contribute to that level of transparency and trust that is so crucial to ‘let go’ of the inhibitions and live out the fantasy. If the screening process is done with a sense of humor and levity; it can almost become foreplay.

If the terms are agreed upon, I suggest first meeting in public for a coffee - this way it is no pressure and, if things don’t click, we can always go our separate ways. However, if they do, going to hotel bar is a great way to extend the date and read the situation more carefully.

If that goes well, that’s when the invite to the hotel is appropriate - but with expectations of zero pressure. Once in the room, asking  transparently “still a full yes?” Is appropriate.

If the answer is yes, from both husband and wife, then the stars are aligning and great things are about to follow.

And again, this is where communication so crucial. Couples have fantasies that they share with us, but ‘in the moment’ things can shift at a rapid pace, so it is critical to be in tune with the couple. On the first date - or the first several - I believe that it is very important to check in verbally before each position change and maintain eye contact with the partners - to make sure that everyone is comfortable.

What a husband/wife has in their mind in fantasy, and what they experience in reality, can have some level of discrepancy - so it is important to be attuned to this and be malleable to meet their needs.

In terms of finishing - make sure to finish exactly where they request (ring, tits, and mouth for reclamation are the big three).

Make sure to bring extra towels, water bottles, flowers and wipes - because aftercare begins immediately after the last orgasm ends; this means cuddles, compliments, and hydration… a little wine never hurts, either.

To me, it is important to understand that aftercare - tailored to the couple - is not optional. You should be ordering foood; helping her to the washroom if it gets particularly intense, and communicating with husband in regards to his specific needs.

I am also a big believer in the “morning-after; thank-you text” to show a level of respect and appreciation for the couples

In the aftermath, respect remains paramount. Do not save nude photos on your phone. Do not brag to others about the amazing experience - your silence is a sign of strength and respect. And make sure to check-in every month or so with zero expectations.

If you operate with a level transparency, trust, and an intellectual understanding of the nature of the role of the ‘third’, this lifestyle can be incredibly gratifying both inside and outside of the bedroom; the lifestyle is not a means to satisfy immediate cravings, but to build a foundation of trust where we can facilitate bringing the deepest fantasies of two people to reality. And that, to me, is amazing and well worth the effort.",10,1764916232.0,nonmonogamy,6,0.71,False

1peny48,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_samir-homejournal/comments/1peny48/why_handcrafted_middle_eastern_furniture_can/,Why Handcrafted Middle Eastern Furniture Can Transform Modern UAE Homes,"Living in the UAE, I’ve noticed how easy it is for modern homes and villas to sometimes feel a little… sterile. Sleek designs, minimal décor, and neutral tones are everywhere, and while that look has its charm, it can sometimes lack personality and warmth. Over the past few years, I’ve personally started exploring handcrafted and [custom antique furniture](https://levantiques.com/), especially Syrian, Moroccan, and Andalusian pieces, and it’s been a game-changer for how my home feels.

What fascinates me most about these pieces is the story behind them. Every carved table, mother-of-pearl inlay console, or hand-carved mirror isn’t just a functional item—it’s a piece of history and culture. Even a single statement piece, like a walnut cabinet with delicate bone inlay or a Moroccan-style coffee table, can completely change the energy of a living room. It becomes the focal point, and suddenly, a space that felt ordinary starts to feel curated and meaningful.

I’ve also realized that handcrafted furniture works well alongside modern interiors. For example, a sleek, minimalist sofa can sit perfectly next to a carved Syrian side table, or a neutral-toned rug can be the perfect backdrop for a warm, solid wood Moroccan cabinet. These pieces bring texture, warmth, and an unmistakable character that factory-made furniture often misses.

Another aspect I love is how durable these pieces are. Solid wood furniture—like walnut or other hardwoods—is built to last, and the handcarving ensures that each item is unique. It’s not just about style; it’s about creating a home that feels timeless. Investing in one or two handcrafted pieces can elevate the entire room, making it feel more luxurious and thoughtfully designed without needing a full remodel.

I also appreciate how these styles reflect Middle Eastern heritage. Majlis furniture, Syrian cabinets, and Moroccan or Andalusian décor carry centuries of design tradition. Adding a carved wooden mirror, a mother-of-pearl accent table, or a bone-inlay console isn’t just decoration—it’s connecting your home to a rich cultural narrative. Even modern homes can feel grounded and inviting when a few of these pieces are thoughtfully placed.

For anyone in the UAE looking to bring more personality into their living spaces, my advice would be: start small. Choose one piece that speaks to you, whether it’s a carved side table, a hand-carved mirror, or a walnut cabinet. Let it be the focal point, and build your room around it. You’ll be surprised at how much impact a single handcrafted piece can make.

Finally, what I love most about these pieces is the human touch. Every curve, inlay, and carving reflects someone’s dedication and skill. It’s a reminder that a home isn’t just about furniture—it’s about warmth, stories, and things that make you feel connected. In a fast-paced city with endless modern apartments and villas, these handcrafted pieces help turn a house into a home.

I’d love to hear from others: have you incorporated Middle Eastern or handcrafted furniture into your living spaces in the UAE or elsewhere? What was the impact, and how did it change the way your home feels?",2,1764916011.0,u_samir-homejournal,0,1.0,False

She had this grounded, patient, present vibe about her. We had hardly any customers so I decided to see if my hunch was right. I had a VERY good feeling she'd be very interesting to talk to based on her whole vibe. But first I was just observing. She wasn't on her phone besides brief checks. She honestly seemed far more fascinated with the mere act of observing itself. Smiling as she glanced around and whatnot. I already had a feeling she was an INFJ. So I went up to her and said I had a question. She turned toward me and asked what it was. I said that I don't often see people sitting and waiting without going on their phones and actually being interested in the world around them. How do you think going from a time period where social media and smart phones didn't exist, to now it does and how does that affect you? How do you feel about it? How do you adapt to it? She said she loves to people watch. She goes to coffee shops and sits and watches how people cannot be present without going on their phones (she gestured this hunched body posture glued to the phone screen). She said people aren't observant at all or aware of their surroundings. I agreed. And said I very much enjoy observing people, taking in reality around me, and being present. I also said I think there's perhaps some underlying anxiety to produce the compulsivity of constantly checking these colors and notifications to see what's there. She then said she believes there's some social conditioning that makes people always want to see what the next person is doing and compare themselves. Rooted in insecurity. I said I can relate to that cause I honestly see that in myself but I value being present more so I consciously practice it. She asked me if I knew my MBTI type. I said I do but I wanted to guess hers first. I asked if she was an INFJ and she said yes. We talked a bit more about it. Told her I was an INTP. She then asks me what I've observed from people today with all the holiday shopping going on. I said that my observation is a bit weird. I like to see the inferences I can make based on microexpressions, undertones, and gestures based on context and chronology. Essentially learning to become more fluent in nonverbal communication. And she lit up and said ""Wow! You're perfect for this job!!"" (I do security). She also said I would be good at undercover theft prevention and she told me a story about how she saw someone get caught by one of the undercover workers. I'm missing a few parts but she ended up saying I'm selling myself short a bit by working this job. I could be working for the CIA as someone undercover. And that was hilarious to me cause I've been told that many times by friends. I told her many friends have told me the same thing, although I'm not really ambitious enough. I'm pretty content with the mundane. I kid you not...she goes ""You could be the mentalist."" And my brain like stuttered for a second cause there's NO WAY she's talking about Patrick Jane right now. Maybe she was referencing something else. Right? So I go ""Huh?"" She says ""You know that show? The Mentalist?"" I said ""I absolutely love that show. Patrick Jane is a fascinating character."" She says ""You're like Patrick Jane! You could be The Mentalist!"" And that's honestly the best compliment I've ever received in my life. So I had to share it.

Just got off work. But close to the end of my shift I started up a conversation with a customer. She was waiting on her ride. This older lady. Probably in her late 50's. She had this grounded, patient, present vibe about her. We had hardly any customers so I decided to see if my hunch was right. I had a VERY good feeling she'd be very interesting to talk to based on her whole vibe. But first I was just observing. She wasn't on her phone besides brief checks. She honestly seemed far more fascinated with the mere act of observing itself. Smiling as she glanced around and whatnot. I already had a feeling she was an INFJ. So I went up to her and said I had a question. She turned toward me and asked what it was.

1penvq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1penvq8/supposedly_mild_chronic_type_c_gastritis_healing/,Supposedly mild chronic type C gastritis - healing?,"Hey everyone, 

for the last three months I'm reading here, sometimes asking or writing myself because I seen to have, after the gastritis it's pretty sure, ""mild chronic type C gastritis"". 

But""mild"" means, I sometimes have pain levels of 2/5 or 3/5, which does not seem mild to me. Adding to that that I'm in permanent pain and my pain scale is most likely screwed up anyways and I think pain is lesser than it already is. So it might even be higher, don't know. 

For about 2 weeks I'm quite ... stable? But in a bad way. I have the feeling that my stomach can't do more. It healed as far as it could and now it says ""hey bud? Without more help I can't get anything else done"".

How long does healing usually take? Because I really miss eating normally, drinking coffee and such. I have been good and not eating anything stomach upsetting or drinking coffee for three months. I don't drink alcohol anyways and don't smoke either, so that wasn't happening too. 

My doctor said, twice a day 20 Omeprazole is as much as he feels safe to prescribe to me, in addition to that I take other stuff as needed (gotten rarer thankfully) and still eat and behave safely, but still have some days where I'm in 2/5 pain - the last four days for example were 1/5 or 2/5 despite meds and everything.

1penvp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1penvp7/i_created_a_sudoku_app_without_knowing_how_to/,I created a Sudoku app without knowing how to play Sudoku (iOS only),"Hey everyone!

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

1penv33,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs_Treatment/comments/1penv33/running_help_my_pvcs/,Running Help My PVCs,"From a previous post:

After averaging 10,000 PVCs a day for more than two years, they have virtually gone away. I learned I had PVCs when I started monitoring my ECG with a Kardia Device in November 2022. I don't know when they started. I could not feel them, and my cardiologist didn't seem concerned about them, so I didn't worry about them.  At times, 50% of my heartbeats would be PVCs. In May of 2024, I read that 10,000 PVCs a day could lead to problems, so I began monitoring them more closely, trying to identify factors correlated to their frequency. I couldn't correlate it to anything in my diet or exercise. I tried grounding, eliminating coffee, and taking magnesium and CoQ10 supplements, and saw no difference. But at the end of June 2025, my PVCs dropped to 3000 a day. And then at the end of September 2025, they virtually disappeared. I asked my cardiologist about this, and she had no explanation.  I am 67 years old and have alway been very active (inlcuding cardio exercise 5 times a week, weight lifting twice a week). The improvements roughly correlate with when I started doing more zone 5 running. (I normally stay in Zone 3 when doing cardio). In May, I went from running once a week to running three times a week.  In August I added interval work into my running program. I don't know if this caused the change, but I don't plan to back off to find out.",1,1764915706.0,PVCs_Treatment,0,1.0,False

I’m a recent revert (almost 1 year) to Islam living in Fredericton, and I’m hoping to connect with other reverts in the city. I haven’t had the chance to visit the mosque yet (feeling a little nervous about that step, to be honest), and I think it would be really helpful to talk to others who have been on a similar journey.

I’ve actually met two reverts recently, which inspired me to see who else is out there! It would be great to have a small group for coffee, support, or just to share experiences.

If you’re a revert in the Fredericton area, or if you have any revert friends, please leave a comment or send me a DM. Jazakallah khair!

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.
