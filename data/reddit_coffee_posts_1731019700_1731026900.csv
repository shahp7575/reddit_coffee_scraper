1gm61qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1gm61qk/post_procedure_diary_it_worked/,Post procedure diary - IT WORKED! ,"Around 2 years ago I discovered RCPD and instantly knew this is what had blighted my life for the last 30 odd years. For some context, I'm a 33 year old male living in Nottingham. My girlfriend (who coincidentally also has RCPD) and I travelled down to London for the procedure with Dr lucy Hicklin at the Nuffield Parkside hospital in Wimbledon in November 2024 after countless hours research into the procedure i chose to go woth Dr Lucy purely on a financial basis. I have self funded the procedure with no medical insurance. I thought I'd document the aftereffects to help better educate anyone thinking of having the procedure themselves. 
I understand cost may play a big factor in others' decision on this procedure so here are the numbers: ¬£700 paid directly to Dr. Lucy in the consultation room. For 100 units of Botox it was ¬£207 totaling ¬£907 for the whole thing. I may be wrong, but I believe the cost for 50 units is ¬£150. 

Day of procedure - Monday 4th November 2024
Procedure due at 1730. Consultation with Dr lucy who asked lots of questions about symptoms and my personal history such as alcohol consumption, diet, exercise routines etc. Diagnosed there and then with having RCPD. Dr lucy explained there isnt a clicical test for RCPD, its diagnosed symptomatically. She then explained the procedure and possible side effects. I asked for 100units however Dr lucy said there is no evidence to suggest 100 is more effective than 50. Procedure very quick! Machine to check for crichopharangeal muscle connected above collar bones. Needle inserted, and a quick sniff and swallow later, its all done. For 100 units, its a needle either side of the throat, 50units a side (however Dr Lucy missed the muscle on the second injection, resulting in a 3rd. This wasn't her fault, and was due to the right side probe coming off) Not painful at all, just feels strange, like pressure. Over in seconds.  Slight Soreness to outside of neck - like bruising. No burps but lots of throat gurgles. Went to bed fine around 10pm, no issues. 


Tuesday 5th November 2024 
Woke up 0700. Neck muscles feel very tight and sore, like I've been punched in the side of the neck. Went for breakfast in the hotel. Immediately noticed i had to swallow twice to clear food properly. 1 tiny little micro burp but not sure how I did it. Ate foods I know cause the gurgle intentionally. 2 cups of coffee. Finished breakfast. Felt bloated but not as much as normal. May have been placebo. Micro burps feel like popping candy stuck in the throat. Micro burps throughout the day at random times. Around the 24 hour post procedure mark, fizzing in throat and what felt like a trapped air bubble (I'm feeling these a little more but don't know how to release them) also a micro burp unexpectedly whilst talking. Had a big drink of Pepsi in the evening and can feel gas trying to escape while I'm drinking (again, I don't know how to release it). Had some food in the evening. Quite difficult to swallow, had to have water close by to chase down every mouthful as food seemed to be getting stuck. Went to bed and slept fine. 

Wednesday 6th November 2024
Nothing much happened when I first woke up. Got on with my day as normal. Noticed a few throat fizzes early morning. Then... at 10.15am l, after a few cups of coffee and a little to eat, I did a burp! Now, it wasn't huge and I have no idea how I pushed it out, but it worked. Few more little fizzers throughout the evening but again, very unpredictable. Really struggled with swallowing this evening. Had to chase every mouthful of food down with water. Went to bed around 11pm.

Thursday 7th November 2024
Holy cow. Slept terrible. The reason being I woke myself up burping. Coffee in the morning proved relatively uneventful. Took the kids to school and had a breakfast roll and coffee in town - incredibly diffictlult to swallow this. Few more burps throughout the morning then went to sleep ready for a night shift. Up around 4pm and had tea at 5. Slow swallow continues and more burps but still unpredictable and still not sure how to release them. Then... at around 10pm... ive cracked it! I somehow worked out that when I feel that fizz in my throat, if I put my chin on my right shoulder and just relax... THE MOST WONDERFUL, LONG, LOUD, DISGUSTING NOISE EVER IMAGINABLE is emitted. But man it feels so good. I'm writing this about an hour after eating along with about a litre of water having done approximately a thousand huge burps. No bloating, no throat gurgles, no need to lie down, no pain, no wind. It's amazing. And i know it's only going to get better. 
This, so far, truly is life changing. For some it may seem trivial - it's just a burp. But having been blighted by this for 30 years, the relief is indescribable. 

I understand this only covers a few days post procedure and many may wish to know how I've got on in the future. I'm more than happy to answer any questions on your own quest for the belch.

Like, I‚Äôm just starting out in my career, and most of my cash goes toward rent, bills, and just basic living stuff. But dating these days feels almost impossible if you‚Äôre not balling out or at least pretending to be. I‚Äôve seen countless profiles where women are straight up about wanting a guy who can ‚Äútreat them‚Äù or they want someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúfinancially secure.‚Äù Which, fair enough, everyone has their preferences, but it leaves guys like me wondering: how do broke dudes even get a chance anymore?

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to be a cheapskate, but I genuinely can‚Äôt afford fancy dinners or weekend getaways. I can do a cute coffee date or a picnic at the park, but is that even enough these days? And even when I suggest those, I feel like I‚Äôm already starting off at a disadvantage, like I have to apologize for not having my life together yet.

I‚Äôve even had some matches tell me upfront that they‚Äôre looking for someone with ‚Äústability,‚Äù and that just makes me feel like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt even be trying to date until I‚Äôm making more money. But then, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just live like a monk and avoid relationships entirely?

So, how do broke dudes pull this off? Is there a way to date without feeling like you‚Äôre at a constant disadvantage, or do you just hope to meet someone who understands where you‚Äôre at in life? Would love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs managed to navigate this.",1,1731026529.0,dating,0,1.0,False

1gm5x86,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1gm5x86/sos_im_at_a_loss/,SOS I‚Äôm at a loss,"Hi all, this may be long so I‚Äôm sorry in advance. But my (24F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been dating for 3 years now. After about a year or so, his mother and sister started to become a problem. Since there‚Äôs so much context/detail, I‚Äôll just organize it into each of them and then by the event. 

SISTER:
- we lived with her for one year our last year at college
- she would consistently break my boundaries by taking my food/drinks without asking, using my stuff without asking, etc.
- I asked bf to say something and he said that‚Äôs just how she was. He thought I should say something since we were pretty close. I felt uncomfortable because we were only close because I was dating him. Eventually we said something, and she shrugged it off and almost made it a pity party by saying ‚Äúyea.. I think I might be a kleptomaniac‚Ä¶ like I just used to steal things from *grandma‚Äôs* house üòì‚Äù 


MOTHER:
- posts on Facebook religiously and often includes photos of us putting all our business online knowing good and well I don‚Äôt like everyone and their mothers knowing where I‚Äôm moving to, what I‚Äôm doing, etc.
- very religious, despite being an extremely vain, hypocritical woman.
- talks about how poor she is, yet goes on weekend trips frequently and owns an expensive boat
- when bf and I moved to new house, my parents helped out a ton. Bf asked his mom if they could possibly help out with a $40 dining room table we found on Facebook marketplace. She said no, it had been a very hard month financially.
- mind you, she retired a few years ago and is still 6 years away from receiving her first SS check. 
- bf has a good job currently, yet has a lot of student debt (which his parents know about). His sister is getting married and his mom didn‚Äôt like her original mother of the bride dress because of the way it made her arms look, so asked bf if he could buy her a new one. I‚Äôm totally not against helping family out, but I feel as if she is lowkey trying to mooch off him thinking he has such a good job, while she sits at home all day ‚Äúenjoying retirement‚Äù
- side note on the mooching, she has made multiple comments, the one that I always remember was when she said ‚Äúwow so many people sent money for your graduation card‚Ä¶ if I would of known that people were sending so much money, I would have sent them to more people!!‚Äù Bf thinks this is totally normal and there‚Äôs nothing weird about this.


BOTH:
- bf and I‚Äôs graduation fell on the same weekend. My family, from 10+ hours away came and stayed at an Airbnb in our college town. While I was upstairs doing my hair, there was a miscommunication downstairs (his parents arrived at the Airbnb to get breakfast/chit chat with my family; they thought my mom was being rude because she was sitting outside talking to my brother and sister-in-law when they walked in, and the food wasn‚Äôt out buffet style). So they immediately left and his sister sent a text in their family group chat that read something like ‚Äúall of them are trash except her grandma.‚Äù His sister was supposed to do my makeup, but clearly they were so mad, they wouldn‚Äôt answer any of my texts. I know I might be dramatic, but they genuinely ruined my graduation. Especially since bf took their side.
- last Christmas, bf‚Äôs family came to visit us in our new home (8ish hours away). I was nervous/anxious for multiple reasons: 
     ‚Ä¢ his sister was staying in a room with multiple expensive clothing items and since she claims she‚Äôs a klepto I was scared she would take something as she has before
     ‚Ä¢ I made a list of stuff to clean and bf didn‚Äôt do his half because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äù; one of the mornings they were, his mom cleaned off the stove (she‚Äôs very passive aggressive, and overthinks so I know she would view this as a slight if the roles were reversed) and looked at me as if it was my fault they were dirty
    ‚Ä¢ his sister and her boyfriend were in the process of renovating and moving into a new house. She shows me photos of it and points out all the stuff her mom helped her buy. This hurt an insane amount as we asked for their help and were denied.
     ‚Ä¢ his mom did multiple loads of laundry while at our house for 5 days, including ONE load for literally ONE pair of pants.
     ‚Ä¢ I was sick and we went hiking. Afterwards, they wanted to go walk around the campus in the town we now live in. I was thinking about staying in the car as I felt awful especially after hiking in the cold with a cold. His sister goes ‚Äúumm are you not going to walk with us?!?‚Äù
     ‚Ä¢ we went to the mall to go shopping, and on the way back his dad said can someone tell me where to go to get home. I said yea I can. Sitting next to me right after I said that, his sister pulls out her phone and pulls up Apple Maps anyway. I ignored it even though I was annoyed. I told his dad to make a left at the next light, and his sister snapped at me and goes ‚Äúnot this light, the next one.‚Äù So at this point I had had it and snapped back with ‚Äúoh my bad!‚Äù Everyone got mad at me, and it was this big ordeal.
- his sisters bachelorette trip (I was a co-MOH) 
   ‚Ä¢ me and the other co-MOH spent so much money on her bachelorette trip, and all she did was show up. I was extremely unaware that it‚Äôs common for the bride to put more effort in. 
   ‚Ä¢ during the bachelorette trip, it rained on the one day we had to go to the beach and she threw a bitch fit. While it was literally storming, we went to a coffee place for breakfast and went to a little boutique next door. We then went to a mini golf place. I could tell she was pissed off the whole time, as could the other MOH. As we were driving back, I saw a store she was singing the slogan to earlier and pointed it out jokingly. She legit said to me ‚Äúif you make me go into another store, I‚Äôll literally kms‚Äù which obviously hurt my feelings and pissed me off.
   ‚Ä¢ the day after the trip, I texted her that she hurt my feelings. This is where it all begins lol. Immediately, she screenshots it and sends it to bf and starts it off with ‚ÄúI know you love her, so I responded as nice as I could‚Äù then proceeds to complain about my ‚Äúbad behavior‚Äù last Christmas. We then had it out over text, I tried being civil and she continued to say nasty things to me (and about me to my bf behind my back)
    ‚Ä¢ his sister goes to his moms house (who had just called me the day before talking about how amazing the trip was and everything) and after they talk, his mom calls bf and is SOBBING and starts talking about me saying that I‚Äôve ruined the wedding, everything is ruined, etc.. she starts saying stuff like ‚ÄúSOMEEE ppl have wronged me and hurt me but I don‚Äôt need an apology but other ppl do I see how it is‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I hurt you when you came to visit over Christmas‚Äù (I had already texted her right after and apologized) and she immediately goes ‚ÄúNO ITS BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES‚Äù and keeps going on about all these perceived slights that she thinks I‚Äôve done. While she was doing this, she talks to bf ABOUT me and while I‚Äôm trying to speak to her, continues to ignore me and only speak to bf about me. She brought up multiple instances (very convoluted ideas) that I wasn‚Äôt good enough/nice enough, etc. She said I had ill intent and want to ruin everything. Clearly this really hurt and I genuinely thought bf and I were going to have to break up because of this. The next day, on bf‚Äôs way home from work, his mother calls and DOUBLES DOWN about what she said.

So bf and I agree to go no contact and just take space before having a conversation. Well he tells his mom that after she continues to attempt to apologize in group texts. During our ‚Äúspace‚Äù period, she still texts bf about miscellaneous things that I feel aren‚Äôt necessary (and clearly doesn‚Äôt respect the boundaries we asked for) and bf answers. After about a month, she asks to call bf to talk. Bf and I had agreed we wouldn‚Äôt speak to her to chit chat until we had a conversation about the incident. Well I reminded him of this, and how it would hurt me if he didn‚Äôt uphold this boundary. Well he went ahead and called his mom because he missed her. So that really hurt. Well a few days later, we had that phone call conversation about the incident and I really wasn‚Äôt satisfied. She kept going on about how she‚Äôs in a really dark place, her and bf have never been in a fight (which makes bf cry bc his mom starts crying obvi), etc.. Bf repeatedly tried to get his mom to explain the root cause of her emotions and why she said what she said. She kept reiterating that it was just the stress of her daughter‚Äôs wedding, etc. 

Well since then, she texts bf and occasionally me in group chats but the most I‚Äôll do is like the text or send back literally a two or three word comment. After reading similar situations on this sub, I told bf that I think I‚Äôd like to go no contact with his family (as he wants to ‚Äúease‚Äù back into relationships with his family as it was before the incident and I just simply cannot fathom that rn) and he said it‚Äôs a big thing to just drop on him and that he needs to think about all of it.

So my colleague (24f) (34f)  has two kids. Her first language is not English. 

She wants me to come over and help teach her kids English pronunciation. I always tease her (nicely) for the way she pronounces things etc and  she always asks me to practice her English. 

Our colleagues refer to me as 'her girlfriend' and she just says 'Aww' 

We play this game of back and forth teasing and we'll lock eyes all the time.  She heart recats to all my messages and every selfie or pic i send. She will send me selfies etc and will message me almost everyday talking about the kids and how they miss me or how they like me etc. We will just talk about how our day is going etc and she will remember random things i tell her and recently she has been wearing blue (my favourite colour) saying she's worn it for me. 

I have blue hair, and someone said we 'looked good' together she DEMANDED we take a selfie together because we looked so good. This is not the first time she has demanded we have a photoshoot together 

I had ONE cup ready to get a coffee for myself. She saw me, walked over and stole my cup out of my hand and made herself a coffee saying 'You're trying to keep me longer at work, aren't you!' whilst smiling and grinning at me

She will bring me coffee in the morning and says we're 'Besties' she uses this term for people who are dating mostly but sometimes just to refer to as friends. 

We had a minor falling out over something dumb and she insisted we weren't besties or 'more than friends' anymore. However she slipped up and said i was her bestie today. I teased her and was like 'Oh? I'm your what now..?' and she blushed and went 'Oh um.... Did i say bestie... No i didn't... Totally ummm' and blushed, rushing to change to subject. 

 
She is always in my personal space. Whenever I look at her she is already looking at me, and shw always stands so close to me.

I go there often and thought they appreciate me coming in. I maybe go twice a week and might spend one hour or so nursing a coffee while i work. Lately they have been asking me if i want a tiny $13 sandwich. I bought a few, sometimes i get other stuff, but it so expensive. There is lots of room in there. But today the owner asked me if i wanted the change back on my $5 bill (canada) and i was thought, your coffee is already super expensive and i barely like it, i'm not giving you another chunk of money, i just go there cause i like the place to hang a bit.  I usually pay with debit and leave maybe 25 cent tip. Feels expensive enough for me for what it is, just a 3/4 empty cafe.  I took all my change back  and didn't even pretend to ding the tip cup and he gave me the stink eye. Its a wait in line service, they are nice enough but, I also noticed he came and asked if he could take my cup away early today im like there is a sip in there still, lol.

Favorite song(s): Disloyal Order, 27, (Coffee's For Closers)  
Least favorite: I Don‚Äôt Care

  
  
**Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes**: 11/10, my favorite Fall Out Boy song ever, perfection  
  
**I Don‚Äôt Care**: 7/10, not a bad song but not really representative of the rest of the songs on the album  
  
**She‚Äôs My Winona:** 8/10, like this one a lot, kind of overshadowed by the rest of the songs on the album though  
America‚Äôs Suitehearts: 9/10, this was one of my favorite songs when it came out  
  
**Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown On a Bad Bet**: 10/10, peak FOB, absolute banger live song  
The (Shipped) Gold Standard: 9/10, some of my favorite lyrics on this one  
  
**(Coffee‚Äôs For Closers)**: 11/10, probably the most underrated FOB song in my opinion, love the violin (?) at the end  
  
**What A Catch, Donnie**: 10/10, a good farewell song for their hiatus, Patrick‚Äôs voice in this is stunning  
  
**27**: 11/10, another one of my top FOB songs (very VERY underrated), love the lyrics and guitar a lot  
  
**Tiffany Blews**: 8/10, Lil Wayne feature!  
  
**w.a.m.s**.: 10/10, love this one, I could listen to him sing ‚Äúfreckle freckle‚Äù over and over  
  
**20 Dollar Nose Bleed:** 10/10, sounds like an early Panic song (and Brenden Urie is featured in it)  
  
**West Coast Smoker**: 10/10, great album outro, the only song where Pete has some screaming (and I believe the last time he screams on any album",2,1731025472.0,FallOutBoy,1,1.0,False

1gm5kfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1gm5kfh/to_all_our_american_newcomers_see_this_stickied/,To all our American newcomers: see this stickied post,"My goodness this subreddit has *exploded* ever since Emperor Trump's ascendency. Literally overnight almost a *thousand* newcomers. WOW. I know you're all scared right now, and rightfully so. I'd be lying if I said I had the answer to all your problems, but I can help you when it comes to HRT. DIY HRT and r/estrogel were born in the face of absolute tyranny and bitter transphobia (just ask Lena or u/Darthemofan!). No matter the freedoms lost, no matter the hardships that await, no matter the strength of our enemies, DIY HRT will *always* be an option. There is no feasible way to ban, seize, or otherwise restrict DIY HRT.

For total newcomers to HRT, I suggest reading DIY HRT Market's overview of transgender medicine: [https://diyhrt.market/transfem-hrt-guide](https://diyhrt.market/transfem-hrt-guide) it's a brilliant, brilliant overview. I sure do wish this was around when I first started DIY HRT.

For those of you who decide injectable HRT is the way to go, see The DIY HRT Wiki: [https://diyhrt.wiki/](https://diyhrt.wiki/)

And of course, I'd be remiss to not draw your attention to the big 3 HRT seller directories: [https://diyhrt.market/](https://diyhrt.market/), [https://hrtcafe.net/](https://hrtcafe.net/), and [https://hrt.coffee/](https://hrt.coffee/) . And see [https://transfemscience.org/](https://transfemscience.org/) for some brilliant, freely accessible science and resources on transgender medicine.

r/estrogel is not like other DIY HRT communities. Indeed all DIY HRT chatter is welcome here, but we specialise in outright *making* HRT. Of all forms, but usually transdermal HRT - ""gels"". ( r/TransDIY and r/AskMtfHRT are more oriented towards conventional HRT). There are many different reasons to choose transdermal HRT over other forms:

\- It's easily the safest form of HRT, you don't ingest anything, nor do you ever break the skin

\- Transdermal estradiol avoids the ""first pass"" through the liver oral pills suffer from

\- Transdermal estradiol offers smoother estradiol levels than sublingual HRT

\- It's dead easy, and dead cheap to make. (You could make possibly 3 year's-worth of HRT for a mere 100 USD)

r/estrogel was founded to reverse engineer estrogel, *the product*. Nowadays we've far surpassed the limits of estrogel. We regularly make estradiol gels more effective and affordable than anything you could ever buy ""legitimately"". We'll start with the fundamentals, there are 4 main components to any HRT gel:

\- The active ingredient (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, antiandrogen, SERM, etc)

\- The solvent (ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, vegetable oil, etc)

\- The penetration enhancer (orange oil, eucalyptus oil, niaouli oil, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, fatty acids, etc)

\- The thickening agent (carbomer 940/980 + triethanolamine, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, glycerol, etc)

\*Naturally, many ingredients can serve multiple purposes. I personally ditch thickening agents, I find they're more hassle than they're worth. But that's a matter of opinion. A HRT gel will work with or without a penetration enhancer, but they work best with one. Each one of these ingredients is cheap, safe, easily accessible, and unrestricted.

As for buying estradiol. I have 2 main sellers I'd reccomend to Americans:

\- Water Lily Pharmaceuticals: [https://waterlilypharmaceutical.godaddysites.com/](https://waterlilypharmaceutical.godaddysites.com/)

\- Allie: [https://allies-site.org/](https://allies-site.org/) (see her onion link too: [http://nyaaaaaaa2t2evbndugpbqoolcsaupqdq6i6v5caqiox2ls5iwp3voyd.onion/](http://nyaaaaaaa2t2evbndugpbqoolcsaupqdq6i6v5caqiox2ls5iwp3voyd.onion/) )

Both these sellers are based in America. Water Lily Pharmaceutical's folks are fairly elusive, but we do know they resell estradiol, and progesterone from a huge stockpile purchased off Sigma Aldrich many years ago. I've personally bought from them, they're the real deal. They have very friendly customer service, and a spotless reputation in the community. Allie is a homebrewer based in America, she makes HRT (using r/estrogel principles). She also resells estradiol by the gram from Greenway, a reputable Chinese biotech company. She's had their estradiol tested, and it came back perfectly legit! Testing is expensive, and few Biotech companies can boast successful independent tests.

As for actual HRT gel recipes, see the (WIP) revised r/estrogel wiki

1gm5kd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gm5kd5/using_coffee_to_cope_with_lack_of_sunlight_the/,Using coffee to cope with lack of sunlight & the cold,"This is purely my personal experience that I wanted to share.

I moved to Canada close to decade ago and since then I felt like my energy has been lacking.

I used to live in a sub-tropical climate and it's been very hard for me to adapt to the lack of sunlight and the cold.

I've found my refuge in coffee as it feels like without it I cannot function normally in this country.

The weird thing is when I go back to the tropics and I stay for a while (> 1month) I start feeling normal and my body start viewing coffee as disgusting.

Last time I went I stopped coffee completely and the sides have been pretty minimal but the second I come back to Canada I get depressed and get back on coffee to self medicate.

I guess I suffer from SAD and probably the only solution for me would be to permanently move out as my genes are not adapted to this kind of climate.

Also. the top consumers of coffee in the world are countries that are cold and have depressing weather (Finland,Norway, Canada, Sweden) etc..

I just want to know if anybody else feels the same way.

So, I went on a date with this girl a while ago. At first, it was a bit awkward, but we ended up really clicking, stayed out late, and even ended up kissing for a while. It was super intense, and I felt there was definitely a connection.

We hung out one more time for coffee, and it went well, but it was more relaxed. No kiss this time, but we had a good conversation, and I thought we‚Äôd keep talking.

First, they deleted the entire Digvijay calling out Avinash's hypocrisy and chori since start of the season from yesterday's episode.

Then, they deleted the Avinash's personal attack to Sara which was so nasty that he was forced to immediately apologize by Vivian

[https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1glg64l/bb\_makers\_deleted\_avinashs\_nasty\_remark\_to\_sara/](https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1glg64l/bb_makers_deleted_avinashs_nasty_remark_to_sara/)

Then, they deleted the part where Avinash was stealing from ration again. And the entire Shrutika fighting with Avinash for stealing her coffee which became Sara's i told you so moment. Then, she asked everyone to check Avinash's suitcase for other ration items. When they all went to search everyone's luggage, Avinash admits to stealing Sugar free stevia from the ration and hands over the same. In LF, he was even hiding something behind the pot in the bathroom area. Sara bashed the Eisha and Alice for again jumping to defend Avinash's stealing.

Only after all this had taken place, Rajat says that shayari of chor Avinash from where today's episode begins. They edited the episode in such a way that it appears as if Avinash was being targeted out of thin air. He has been stealing nonstop since the start of the season.

They even edited the part where the Chor chugli gang are talking abt clearing out other stolen things from their bedroom and plotting to put it in other's bedroom space to shift blame. This crooked idea was given by creepy Alice again.

Not just this, Kashish and Shilpa were praising even Digvijay's body during work outs, but they edited it out to show as if they were praising only Avinash.

But I (Little Cat, 15F, ginger and white cat, loves confusing humans) am writing this because according to the Female Human, I am the oldest and therefore should know better. 

The Female Human has torn some muscles in her back again. She can't do much except lie flat and do gentle stretches. She can't even make coffee, because she can't bend and get milk out of the fridge, which is a terrible fate for a coffee-powered human. Basically she's helpless. 

And last night there was a moth in the house. ***There was a moth in the house!*** One of those big flappy ones that makes a noise when it flies. It was a moth! It was in the house! 

It was like several thousand years of domestication just dropped away. We could hear the voices of our ancestors telling us: ***""Get that moth!""***

At first the Female Human didn't know what was going on. She just heard running, and banging, and the occasional crash. The Male Human had taken most of the furless kittens to do the supermarket shopping, so she was alone in the house, except for us. And the moth. (And Beelzebun, but he doesn't talk much.) We could hear her shouting, ""What are you up to, you pair of furry cloacas!"", or ""Don't destroy the house, you wretched creatures!"". 

Then the moth flew into her room, and we barrelled after it. Female Human said we looked like a pair of berserkers, with mad staring eyes and our tails lashing around. I bounced up on the mattress, then used its springiness to parkour up the wall to try and catch it, narrowly missing her head. Female Human shrieked I was 15, and I could do myself a mischief. 

After that she pulled the covers up over her head, and called the Male Human to ask how long he would be, because she was stuck in the room with a herd of rampaging wildebeest trying to annihilate a moth. (Female Human: I heard him telling the kids, ""Quick! In the car! We have to rescue OP!"")

A few minutes later, the Male Human arrived home and ""encouraged"" the moth to go outside. Civilisation returned. Female Human gave us a long lecture (still lying down) about all the ways we were cloacas. (I'm old and expensive to fix, eating moths is bad for cats, bogongs are endangered ... )

But I say, we were not cloacas. Because ***there was a moth in the house!*** ",26,1731023537.0,AmItheCloaca,10,0.97,False
1gm4wvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1gm4wvg/wild_and_wonderful_a_warning_for_se_parents/,Wild and Wonderful - A Warning for SE Parents Needing Childcare,"Okay, I really didn‚Äôt want to make this post, but the childcare crisis is rough and I felt like I needed to make a warning post since childcare can literally make or break someone‚Äôs life. If you‚Äôre a parent and you‚Äôre lured by the immediate openings of this place, please read this post.

Short version: this place is managed like an MLM. It has ruined my life.

Let me explain why: most parents are drawn to them because they typically have openings when most daycares are usually at capacity. That was the reason why I ended up with them. I had just gone back to work, and I desperately needed childcare. What they don't tell you when you sign a contract with them is that 1) they require a deposit, and 2) they don't refund that deposit unless you give them a 60 day notice.

First of all, that expectation is egregious. I have toured numerous daycares after the horrible experience I had with them, and this was not the case in any of them. But I was like, ""Okay, this place is cute and I need childcare, I'll probably never leave."" Oh boy, was I wrong.

They don't provide food -- you have to bring your own lunch. Again, not the expectation at any of the daycares that I toured. This literally made my morning routine hell, because I had to feed my kid, feed myself, and make his lunch while dealing with the usual challenges of taking care of a toddler before getting out the door in time for drop off. My office hours start at 7:30 AM, so this was insane to manage. That's also when they open -- and that is IF they open (which is another story I'll get into below). When they do provide snacks, it's like a small amount of cheerios that they serve in a coffee filter.

Then there are the closures. They closed unexpectedly at least once a month for the ten months I was there, sometimes more. My sick days were supposed to roll over and then get paid out when I retire; instead, I used all of them on this freaking place. I couldn't take a day off when I was sick. I couldn't go on vacation. No mental health days for me. I used every. single. last. day. on their constant last-minute closures. They were also constantly late. In my first year of my new job after having a baby, I was constantly stuck calling in or coming in late because of this place. Thank heavens I‚Äôm so good at my job because their unprofessionalism made me look like a fool.

And my favorite part: the judgmental staff. I have never felt so much mean girl energy in my life. At one point, Kalia, the director had her Instagram bio say ""cool and cruel,"" just to give you an idea of the type of people running this place. I made one mistake when packing his lunch (because my mornings were hell, like I mentioned above) where I packed an avocado that was on the cusp but still looked okay that morning. By the time it was lunch time, it had gone bad. No big deal, you know, stuff happens. Except I heard about it EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. for a week and a half straight. Including from staff that wasn't even working that day. They took a picture. I'm guessing they were gossiping about it because there is no other way everyone would find out.

Oh, but let me mention the MLM part. They require a 60 day notice. I paid a deposit. I gave a 45 day notice, not even realizing the 60 day requirement, but I figured I'd be generous to give them time to fill my spot. I even paid the full month of June even though I wasn't going to be using it for half the month. That, in itself, should have been sufficient for the 60 day requirement. I even saw them giving tours when I gave my notice.

They still refused to refund my deposit. I am now out $2500 in unused childcare and my deposit.

I figured out their strategy; they require a deposit and a 60 day notice. They push families away with their awful service. Families leave, thus leaving their deposits behind. They find a new family because childcare is so scarce in Portland. They collect a new deposit, new tuition, and don't refund the old deposit -- essentially receiving double/triple the money than they would have if they had just provided decent service to begin with. I just got an email from them saying that they have openings; now I know why.

I should also mention that they have two five star reviews on Google with the same first name posted with the same time frame. They're not even trying to be subtle with their fake reviews, or they think customers are too stupid to notice. I also noticed that the owner, Taylor, is replying with fake or bad faith replies in the reviews because she knows customers can‚Äôt reply back. For instance, she posted the credit card number of one customer on the reply, she also completely lied about their director ‚Äúbeing on leave‚Äù when the old director left for a new job, and is all around trying to play innocent when the reality is that she doesn‚Äôt give a shit about your kids. She just wants to profit off the childcare crisis ‚Äî which is sad, because as a working woman and business owner, you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd have some empathy for the women that need childcare. Instead, she‚Äôs just out to scam them.

If you‚Äôre looking for childcare, please hold out for some place better. This place is not the one. And if you‚Äôre not in the SE Portland area but still looking for childcare: let this story be a wake up call that there are some bad actors out there that will exploit the crisis to make a quick buck.",25,1731023496.0,PortlandOR,1,1.0,False

You might have a chance to bond with your son, though.","Hi mom. The other day, when i came home and after we talked a bit, you came up to me. You came up to me and said that you are so happy to see me so cheerful. I have no idea what we were talking about, or why you said that, i wasn't that joyous to where it's worthy of mentioning.

And then you said, things are gonna change. Things are gonna change because this isn't how a family should be. This isn't how a normal family is. We should be happier, more balanced, all that jazz.

You are right. I have come to that conclusion years ago, when you and dad decided to start ignoring me. I came to that conclusion years ago, when i was crying in my room, begging for some sort of comfort but not having anyone to go to, because no one felt safe. I came to that conclusion years ago while sitting in the tub and cutting my thighs, having a breakdown because i felt so unloved. I came to that conclusion years ago when i was excluded from every friend group in school, and then came home to arguments, yelling and hate.

But for so long i was hopeful. I invited you out to walks, the coffee shop, the gym, yoga classes; you promised to come but you just got upset when i asked for the 3rd time. I came to you to draw together, knit together, do all sorts of things together; you were always too tired or uninterested. You would say, ""it's not my thing"" or ""i'm not the creative one, you are"" yet you woukd never offer an alternative that you liked.

I wish i still had hope. I knew i lost it all when one night, you finally caved after i pestered you for so long. We sat down to play a card game. It felt awkward and uncomfortable. It felt like i was sitting with a stranger. That night, i knew i was over it all.

I can't be brought back. I am no longer interested in trying. It feels weird to spend time with you and dad. So i'm sorry but i will not be participating in this. I'm making my own family, my own little community. Please do not put effort into trying to pull me back because i am not interested.

I will be there to help. I will look out for you and dad. When i make it big, i will send you money, buy you and dad cars and a nice house and retire you two. But right now, i am moving as soon as i have a car and the funds. I love you but we grew distant. Too distant.

So please don't try. Put all that effort into my brother instead. Be more strict. Don't pamper him like you do now. It's so frustrating to see how disrespectful he is with you. I wish i could help you but him and dad are the same. They both don't care. And my voice isn't worth anything either. So sit dad down, talk some sense into him. Raise my brother well, make him a successful man. Change your parenting so he respects your word or i will slap some sense into him for you. I am already hated enough by all three of you so if what it takes for my brother to respect you more is to make all of you hate me even more, then so be it.

No, the way things are here isn't normal. I hope you all can fix it. I have too much on my plate to be involved. I have to study, work, i'm doing my driver's license, i found good friends and i'm looking to find even more, i have hobbies and passion and dreams to pursue. I won't have the time or energy for other things.

1gm4u5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gm4u5s/faceless_mary_cross_post_from_nosleep/,Faceless Mary (cross post from nosleep),"Hey Nosleep. I‚Äôm Trish, I‚Äôve lurked on this subreddit for a while now, reading everyone‚Äôs experiences and what not. I always was skeptical of them, until about a month ago. I‚Äôm in high school, junior year to be exact, and at homecoming something happened.

My best friend, Mary, was always a bit of a recluse. Even when we were five she would fake being sick just to stay at my house for the day. Even after our parents stopped talking to each other my dad would always let her stay the night despite his own issues with her parents. I never knew what happened between them, I don‚Äôt think I ever will after what happened.

Mary liked to prank people, a lot. She got in trouble with so many of our teachers because of her pranks. I remember this one day in our freshman year, she was pitching a scheme to me. She wanted to glitter bomb our homeroom teacher, ended up suspended for a day because of it.

I think that fueled her pranks, honestly I wish it never did. I wish she just stopped. I wish she didn‚Äôt get worse. She kept pranking our teachers, kept getting suspended and getting detentions. It got worse. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it when it happened, I was like a frog in a slowly boiling pot. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until it was too late. How could I?

She stuck to her glitter bombs for a long time, it was harmless minus the mess. No one would think anything of it. I certainly didn‚Äôt. When she started taking interest in those more advanced glitter bombs I didn‚Äôt care. It was just glitter. In our sophomore year she started taking a mechanics class.

She was so excited about it. She‚Äôd rush to my house after school each day and have me make things with her. I didn‚Äôt fully get all of it, but Mary was so happy. Even when she started bringing car parts over I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.

One time she came over and slammed this car engine onto the coffee table, I nearly fell out of the couch at the slamming noise.

‚ÄúBe careful, that‚Äôs an old table!‚Äù My dad called from the kitchen. He always avoided her when she came over.

‚ÄúSorry, Mr. Davidson!‚Äù Mary called back, before whipping her head over to me. She blew some of her black hair out of her face, smiling wide. ‚ÄúGuess how much I got this for!‚Äù

I sighed, moving to stand up. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a dump right by your house, I know you got it from there.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually that closed, dangerous conditions or something I don‚Äôt know. Nah, Mrs. Forrest gave it to me!‚Äù Mary said. ‚ÄúCompletely free of charge. She phrased it as a school project, but apparently it‚Äôs not exactly for a grade.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe phrased it weirdly.‚Äù Mary shrugs.

‚ÄúAh. So what do you need to do to it?‚Äù I asked.

Mary beamed. ‚ÄúClean it out, get rid of some dents and the rust.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound fun.‚Äù I point out

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt make it fun.‚Äù Mary retorted

I shrugged, not knowing how to reply to that. For the rest of the day Mary and I worked at it until she had to head home. I never liked working at car parts, but she loved it. Mary always loved the mechanical aspect of things. Maybe she should‚Äôve been a suspect when things first started to happen.

Mrs. Forrest, Mary‚Äôs mechanics teacher, ended up hospitalized three months later. I never learned too many of the details, but I remember when the cops came to my door. They asked me if I knew her, knew anyone who had a grudge against her in her class, all of that. Apparently a fuse blew while she was grading a project, and she couldn‚Äôt remember which one went off.

Everyone knew it was some sort of foul play, but no one knew who it was. I never suspected Mary, and maybe it never was her, but everything else lined up so well. She just seemed so worried. She was my best friend, how could I suspect her? Why would I? Surely the police would figure it out and make an arrest, but they never did.

More incidents occurred, all to teachers. Mrs. Forrest was the only one who taught Mary, but all of them had a similar case. Something blew in their house, and their face became heavily scarred as a result.

After the fourth incident, Mary started acting weird. She became fixated on her face. Whenever she came over she‚Äôd pick and scratch at it. Her face became red and raw. My dad started to buy her face creams, and he even considered talking to her parents. I didn‚Äôt know why he worried so much. I didn‚Äôt know why then.

Once the school year ended, the incidents stopped. Mary became more aggressive to other students in our year, but never to me. Then junior year began. It was going to be our first year having a prom. We were gonna go together, as we always did with homecoming.

Even then, we still treated homecoming as serious as we could. We went dress shopping where we always did. It was this small store owned by Ms. Ellen and her grandkids. Ms. Ellen would always make the most intricate dresses, and we loved them.

We were looking through the store, every year Ms. Ellen would make something new and we were excited to see what it was. This time all of her dresses had some sort of bow motif. Mary found a sleeveless red dress with a large frilly skirt, the waist was wrapped with a black ribbon with a bow in the back. It was beautiful, and Mary looked beautiful in it when she tried it on. I ended up with a blue dress, it was the same design as Mary‚Äôs, but with a white ribbon instead.

Mary seemed blank that day, staring into space almost every minute. I wasn‚Äôt bothered, she always spaced out. Yet this was different. It was longer, and she seemed focused on whatever she was staring at. Once I saw her moving her jaw up and down, almost like a dummy being puppeteered to talk.

It was creepy, but maybe it was nothing. I ignored it. I ignored every sign until it was too late, until homecoming came and I saw what she became. Maybe if I noticed sooner, maybe if I said something, maybe she‚Äôd be ok.

Homecoming was the same as always, at first. I got there before Mary, sticking by the food table as I waited for her. Music was going, and it covered up the squeaking of shoes on the gym floor. It was dark, only being lit up with colored spot lights.

I was focused on the doors, and soon enough they opened. Into the gym stepped Mary. She was completely barefoot, dirt and grass sticking to her feet, her hair was barely brushed, draping down her masked face, yet her dress was perfect, having no stains or tears. It was almost like a doll you played with too much.

For some reason, I didn‚Äôt walk over to her. My feet were glued to the ground. She slowly moved her hand to her face, her fingernails looked sharp and like they were stained with something. Mary carefully removed her mask, hair falling to the side.

She didn‚Äôt have a face. It wasn‚Äôt there. I mean it was there but it just wasn‚Äôt. Instead of the red and raw skin, there wasn‚Äôt any skin at all. Instead rough, patchy, bleeding flesh. She tore off her own face.

A chaperone quickly went to check on her, while another took out his phone to presumably call an ambulance. Before the chaperone approaching her could even get a word out, Mary lunged at her. She was like an animal, tearing at the screaming chaperones face.

The homecoming turned to chaos. Some braver students attempted to shove Mary away, only to get stabbed by the knife she wielded. I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt notice it at first. Many ran, the chaperone calling 911 got through. I‚Äôm still convinced that‚Äôs why so many survived. I doubt we would have without him. Mary got off of the chaperone she had mauled, and began to charge at whoever she could. She stabbed, she tore, she fought. Mary was like an animal. I didn‚Äôt run like so many others. No one tried to get me.

Soon enough, Mary and I were the only breathing things in that room. Bodies littered the ground, their faces all bloodied or gone. Mary limped forward towards me, I guess someone got a lucky hit. She tilted her head, hazel eyes shining in the remaining lights.

I finally managed to convince my body to cooperate, taking a step backwards. ‚ÄúMary..?‚Äù I began slowly.

She let out an animalistic grunt, the muscles around her eyes contracting in what I could only assume was a smile.

For some reason, she didn‚Äôt seem like a threat to me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was terrified, but I just knew she wouldn‚Äôt hurt me. Somehow I knew. I didn‚Äôt step closer, I wasn‚Äôt stupid, but when she got right in my face I didn‚Äôt step away.

She reached a hand up to my hair, tracing through it. Her fingers twirled through the blonde and her muscles contracted in that smile. Her fingers were sharp, almost like claws. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever know what happened.

When the sirens approached, Mary jerked away from me and ran. Police rushed into the gym, and when they saw me as the only living thing there they took me away and wrapped me in a shock blanket. It wasn‚Äôt cold, but the heavy and uncomfortable fabric soothed me. I told the police what I saw, and when the other survivors confirmed the story the police got off my back.

There weren‚Äôt too many causalities, according to the police. Apparently only a few people actually died before making it to the hospital, I think our local news put it to three deaths? I don‚Äôt think anything‚Äôs made it to the big news networks, we‚Äôre a small town and it‚Äôs not like death is uncommon these days. They‚Äôd want something big, I don‚Äôt really know if this qualifies.

They‚Äôre still looking for Mary, and even if they haven‚Äôt found her it‚Äôs only been a month. We all know she‚Äôs still out there. They would have more answers, but when the police went to her parents house they found their fate. According to the police there were symbols tattooed on their backs.

I know my dad knows something about it, but he won‚Äôt tell me anything. He says it‚Äôs not worth it. He says Mary‚Äôs gone now. I know she‚Äôs not. I know she‚Äôs still out there, still in this neighborhood, still lurking. I know she won‚Äôt hurt me, but anyone could be next. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I still care about Mary, and I know she cares about me but I can‚Äôt just go after her can I?

I‚Äôm scared, I just want my friend back. How am I supposed to go back to school? How am I meant to recover?

I don‚Äôt know. Everything went away, everything I cared about left me and my dad doesn‚Äôt even care enough to tell me what he knows.",2,1731023279.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

And then we finally met, okay naman, everything went well, we ate and had coffee and talked about life. Even shared sa kanya what I have been through sa past relationships ko. And as the days go by, he kept on reassuring me na mindful naman daw siya about my past and that I should chill and trust him daw coz he would not put me in those situations again. And naniniwala naman ako. So I brought my walls down for him and gave him a chance. And then we were able to hangout some more pa. But may isang instance na I found something skeptical doon sa messenger niya na may nickname of some sort tas may ‚ù§Ô∏è which I found odd so tinanong ko lang siya about it. Tbh. I was having doubts coz nagkamali din siya ng endearment sakin one time, pero nagas-light ata ko saying na di daw kami confined sa iisang tawagan lang whatevs. But ung namali niya na tawag sakin was the same nickname that I saw. And I asked him about it in a calm and nice way and then he denied na wala yun. And then syempre I don‚Äôt have the peace of mind yet, so I brought it up again saying na if wala talaga, can you please show me po ung messenger for reassurance purposes. I consulted my other guy friends about this, and they said na if sila nasa situation ‚Äî they‚Äôd show it in a heartbeat esp kung walang tinatago. And then he got mad at me for asking about it again, na sana di nalang daw kami nagkita if aawayin ko lang siya (eh di ko naman siya inaaway I was just asking lang). So ayun, I sent him a long message and up until today he hasnt responded to it, kumbaga nagchange topic na siya sa mga paguusap namin these past few days.

My parents didn‚Äôt take me to the dentist and never really checked on me hygiene wise unless I was smelly. When I was 17 I had a toothache. Went to the dentist and he sexually assaulted me. I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what it was until I went back at 19.  My boyfriend had knocked my tooth out during a fight. The dentist did it again. This time I knew. I never went back. At 25 I was making no money, on Medicaid and had a horrible toothache. Worked up the courage to go to a dentist. They said I need root canals (plural) and my insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it. My credit was bad and they wouldn‚Äôt offer financing. I never went back. Season after season the pain came and went. My teeth got worse. My depression got worse. My confidence shattered. I stopped smiling. Countless appointments scheduled and missed, severe depression, so much medication and hours of therapy later I went back at 31. She was impatience, rough and made me feel awful. I expressed my fear of men and she still referred me to a male surgeon. I didn‚Äôt go back. 

Today I have private insurance for the first time ever. I‚Äôve been trying to schedule an appointment since April when I started this job. Sunday night I impulsively made a dental appointment. Monday afternoon I went. The first thing the Dr. said was ‚ÄúI feel like I don‚Äôt have to tell you what‚Äôs needed but I do have to tell you, it‚Äôs all going to be okay.‚Äù They were patient and gentle and kind. They were patient while I cried through my X-rays and gave me tissues when my nose began to run. They let me keep the xray vest and my headphones on because I said it made me feel better. He walked me through the treatment plan in baby steps. Told me we‚Äôre going to take care of you. The Sr. Patient Relations woman came in and walked me through what it would look like with insurance. She gave me preliminary numbers. She guided me on how to maximize my benefits and lower costs. 

I need 8 extractions, 1 root canal, 2 fill ins, braces to correct the crowding and reconstruction. I will probably wear a partial denture while I save up the money to do this. Today I went back the hygienist. She was so gentle and caring. She said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to guide you on brushing and flossing because you‚Äôre doing a good job. Recommended I switch to a soft toothbrush. I got a goody bag and a coffee mug as a gift for my upcoming birthday. I don‚Äôt wish my teeth killed me anymore. I finally believe I will be able to laugh and smile the way I‚Äôve always wanted to. I finally believe I will be able to eat without pain and kiss longer than a peck out of fear that the other person might notice. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you all for your stories and honesty. 

TLDR: long time lurker, first time poster finally went back to the dentist after years of bad experiences. Lots of work but couldn‚Äôt have built up the courage without this sub. ",14,1731023053.0,DentalHygiene,3,0.94,False
1gm4qyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gm4qyg/wanting_to_get_into_espresso_where_do_i_start_500/,Wanting to get into Espresso -  where do I start? [$500],"Hey everyone,

I'm a major noob and I'm sure I'm the 500th person this week to ask some variant of this question (hoping this is the right flair to use). But I've also lived by the philosophy that it's good to ask similar questions multiple times because different people answer each time with different advice, some of which may be useful even to seasoned experts. So with that said, here goes:

My birthday is coming up (Dec 21) and I'm looking for what to put on my list, since my wife and other family members will ask. I'm interested in getting a better espresso machine, since the one I have is very cheap and the steaming wand sucks (Frossvt is the brand but idk the model. It was barely above $100).  
I currently work at a coffee shop as a second job (Caribou coffee for anyone familiar) and I'm pretty decent at steaming milk, but our espresso machines are very automated and do everything for us with the press of a screen, so I have a lot to learn when it comes to that part of making espresso. I'm located in Michigan if that helps.

I have 2 questions:

1. Where do I start when it comes to researching the best equipment, practices, and beans? I've never put much stock into the beans that I buy for regular coffee or for espresso. I certainly have a ways to go in refining my pallet, but I do know that I like dark roast far better than light roast coffee. There is just so much information when it comes to espresso and I didn't know it was so extensive until the last week or so when I started seeing posts from this sub, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed with it all. I'm also finding out that apparently the grinder you use makes a huge difference. How exactly is that? I understand that the longer you let the beans sit after grinding, the more flavor they lose, but I thought that was all there is to it (aside from the grind size itself).
2. Is the Breville Bambino a good budget starter machine? I don't expect anyone to get me something more than 2 or 3 hundred dollars (that's reaching tbh) and I've seen a handful of people in this sub mention that machine. But if there are other machines I should consider in that price range then that would be good to know. I've also seen people recommend the Baratza Encore ESP as a good grinder. What even makes a grinder good or bad? I put $500 as my budget since that's about the price of these two items combined. Whatever I don't get as a gift, I intend on purchasing for myself a bit later. Also if there is any other must-have equipment, I'd love to hear about it.

I truly appreciate anyone's help. And again I'm sorry if I'm asking a question that too many people ask, but with me working 2 jobs I don't have time to watch youtube videos like I normally would, and I retain information much better when I interact with people in a forum like this rather than reading a million articles that have conflicting info and I can't ask them questions directly.",2,1731023034.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

I tried DM'ing some people from the other post but I figured this might get more views. I am waiting on my CCW in the mail but I absolutely do not feel comfortable going to a gun range as someone who looks Muslim to a trump supporter. I'm sure there's many other people who feel the same way for different reasons.

The next 3 months and onward we need to be building community and finding like-minded people we can trust. That means a safe space where there's not homophobia, transphobia, sexism, or racism. I'm not trying to build an SRA type group, or trying to have some political ideology be a focus of the group. I've met some people from the SRA in Greensboro and quite frankly those people seem unhinged and I do not feel safe around them. I'm trying to have the group I'm wanting to form be inclusive and friendly as long as your beliefs are too.

I would like it to be a social group as well where we're not just doing gun things. Things like meeting up at coffee shops or dog walks (my dogs love new people so much and are pretty much instantly bonded to them it's honestly kind of insulting).

been seeing this guy for 2 months na and he does not make me pull my wallet every time we go out. but this time, ako ang taya. i had this plan and literally asked him to go out on a date with me bc my ate paid me to do something that ive been procrastinating na for a month and siya yung tumapos ng lahat ng yun, ni wala akong ginawa as in tinapos niya yun habang sinasamahan ako sa shift ko para daw mabawasan na yung alalahanin ko. he didnt know how big he is of help, and i was really touched with that gesture so sabi ko magsamgyup kami and my treat. at first, he was hesitant bc he knew i was saving up since i had a goal of moving out by next year. pero sabi ko, this is an extra money so hindi naman masasagasaan ipon ko and eventually, napapayag ko rin siya. 

last night came and we went na dun sa samgyupsalan. i was silently giggling when i asked him na ituro niya yung gusto niyang set na parang milyonaryo ako kasi ako yung madalas tinatanong ng ganun tas ayun para siyang bata na tinuturo yung paborito niyang candy habang tinitignan ako huhuhu ang cute. first time namin magsamgyup together and di siya matigil kaka-thank you sa akin pati sa staff every time magrerequest siya ng refill. habang nagluluto siya nahuli niya akong nakatingin sa kanya so sabi ko, ""ang pogi mo naman today,"" tas grabe kung makapigil ng ngiti HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. siya yung cook that time pero ako yung cooked huhu halp

we finished the last batch then umalis na kami para pumunta ng 711 to have coffee naman. i didnt want anything kasi im full already so sabi ko coffee lang, tas nung nakapila na kami pinakita niya sa akin yung gummy bear na favorite ko!!! the way id totally die to be known like that :(

after that, we sat on the gutter outside 711 kasi puno sa loob and magvevape din kami so there we drank our nescafe black in can while our smokes intertwined in the air. thats when he brought up about the condo that i was telling him the other day na pinopropose ko sa tita ko na ipa-rent na lang sa akin. then i opened up na minsan sa umaga kapag sinasabi namin sa isa't isa na matutulog na, hindi pa talaga ako natutulog nun kasi maglalaan ako ng oras para magtingin tingin ng apartment at nakagawian ko na siya bago matulog. kinwento ko rin na may notebook pa ako kung saan ko nililista lahat ng plans ko in living independently then he rubbed my back and kissed my temple while i continued laying my goals and fears to him nang nakatulala sa daan. this is one of the huge risk that im looking forward to and ill be taking sooner. he said na he is excited na matupad lahat ng gusto kong mangyari kasi alam niyang mangyayari daw yun and tutulungan at tuturuan niya ako on how i can survive living alone once that happens. during that time, feeling ko lahat ng imposible kaya ko gawing posible at parang gusto ko pang mangarap nang mangarap kasi sa totoo lang wala talaga akong pangarap e hahahahaha

nung nakauwi na, nagpasalamat na naman siya dahil daw nabusog ko siya. isang beses ko lang naman siya nitreat at feeling ko hindi niya na makakalimutan yun hahaha. i am so happy na pinagbigyan niya ako na itreat siya kahit na di ko naman daw kailangan gawin yun, at makita rin na naaappreciate niya yung mga maliliit na bagay na naibibigay ko for him. little did he know na mas naappreciate ko siya for always providing me emotional space, safety, and reliability to the point na i badly wanted to give back and reciprocate everything.

1gm4n8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gm4n8z/i_really_do_think_this_is_the_end_of_a_less_than/,I really do think this is the end of a less than beautiful partnership! ,"5 years ago my husband got the sack from his job. He tells people that he had a disagreement with his manager at work and strictly speaking that is true. The disagreement was that my husband should have been doing his job for his wages but he disagreed. He got the sack after getting his full wage for 8 goddam years with full support with his disability from work and he refused to do a minutes worth of graft for his wages. Not only did he use his disability against his employers, he used it as a way to drag me down too! He literally spent 8 full years doing nothing but watching porn, and treating me like the girls he saw on film. No, his job didn't involve that stuff, he just refused to do his job therefore he got the sack.

I got a job but it wasn't enough. With my benefits AND my job it wasn't enough to match the wage he was earning by not going to work and he made sure I knew that. He made sure to know that his wage covered the bills so if he wanted to spend what little we had in savings he could because he had earned it. For my 40th birthday he got a sports car and I got some new bras. Not fucking kidding. He 'allowed' me to spend my wages on new underwear. I am actually disabled and getting disability benefits so because I got benefits and not an actual wage then I was obviously scum too. He once stood over me and spat 'You're a waste of space and you shoud get a job and stop sponging off me!' whilst actually not getting up for work but I was doing 12 hour days and housework and upkeep and let care and DIY and absolutely everything else you can imagine that would keep another person living in your house alive. I swear I did EVERYTHING! The into expectation I have ever had of him is that if he wants a coffee in a me ninf then he makes it himself. That has literally been my only rule and even that has been for a reason (every dropped a fully boiled kettle on your privates? I have, and I never EVER want to do it again ) 

Now, we own a business together, and this attitude of 'I do nothing but earn everything, whilst you do everything and earn nothing' seems to be ingrained in my husband and the only escape I can see is taking him to the cleaners or taking myself to dignitas. I have worked my goddam ass off for the past 17 years trying to please the unhappiest person on the planet and he is the most hurt one because he may have to do 40 hours of work for himself if he wants to maintain his fortune. I don't get paid a single penny. Not one! I haven't threatened to take everything from him in this divorce. On the contrary the only thing I have asked is respect from him and I am prepared to part ways if I don't have it. He sulks and pouts and gives me the silent treatment when I say anything so I usually just give him what he wants 

Not any more!

Am fucking done with being his doormat. I do everything he demands and it still isn't enough. He films me going about my day, he says it is to protect me, but all he does is pick up on my mistakes. It doesn't matter if I spotted my mistake, it was a mistake nonetheless and must be punished. I am fed up of being shouted at, moaned at, nagged at. He thinks it is funny to watch me back down and fade like I don't matter. He is the boss. He is right in any and all circumstances. When we first met he loaned me his laptop. When I gave it back I found he had hacked my email to send a message to himself. The message said, remembering it looked like I wrote it, 'You're right. You're always right. If I should ever doubt that you're right just remember that you're always right and nothing I say from now will change that!' If any disagreement followed after he sent that email to himself he would just say 'Remember the email you wrote!' and would walk away. Our problems started when I told him that email wasn't going to control things any more. 

Here's the thing. I know I'm a mess. I know am not perfect. But neither is my fucking husband. He spent a good 1 minute today telling me not only to do something but also how to do it and how he feels it would benefit me. He was wrong from start to finish but at the end of it when I hadn't done everything he 'expected' of me, he got angry. Like it was MY fault that I hadn't met the expectations that I never actually said I would meet because I didn't actually know what they were. 

Let me be clear. My failure wasn't a big deal, could be done at any time, and indeed he did it whilst I did a bunch of other stuff and it took only a few minutes. He was only able to do it because I took on ALL of the other distractions...but he was still mad. I told him to watch the video of me at work (he watches me at work. He says for safety reasons) and I asked him to find a second of me not working on arse off but he got mad and defensive. Told me he didn't need to see it to see what happened and that I still failed.

How can I stay married to someone who doesn't see, even when it is on film, that I am working my arse off to give him the life he wants? I don't care about money. The bullsvafe paid and I am beyond the stage of having any hopes and dreams. He can see with his own 2 eyes that I am running myself into heart failure to give him what he says he wants and his response is to drag me down to levels of misery I have never known. What did i do to deserve this treatment from him? 

I think I deserve more in life than to wake up each morning being scared. All it takes is for him to wake up for a pee in the night and he hates me for the rest of the week. I am so tired of being shouted at for things I don't know about or can control. I would like to be excited about life and not being absolutely petrified every waking minute 

But most of all I would like a husband that loves me. ",1,1731022753.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

I (26M) am getting my PhD and my social life has taken a toll ever since. My program is extremely small and isn't full of social people. I've been reflecting on my life and I want to make some changes instead of just rotting in my bed binging Netflix, specially since San Diego is so pretty. What I've tried so far: 

1. School clubs: Most of them are filled with 18-20 year olds or don't accept grad students.

2. Meetup: Most people came in groups and leave like that. I'm not too extroverted and find it hard to insert myself in such settings. 

3. Sports: I've made some friends through a board game club as most of the other sports are kinda expensive to play. Does anyone know any cheap/free membership for outdoorsy ones- pickleball, soccer, badminton, tennis, etc.? 


I'd really appreciate any response from people who have been through this phase and found a way to connect with someone. Feel free to DM if you're in a similar boat and would like some company and motivation to get out of bed

Here's the thing about tariffs and protectionism.  
The claim from many ""economic experts"" is that the price will go up when you raise tariffs and raising tariffs means taxing Americans.  
  
But History tells the otherwise, Americans were living with domestic made products for like 200 years and nobody felt like things were costly in the past.  
Trump's previous presidency levied heavy tariffs on a lot of raw materials and imported products but you still feel like a grocery trip under Trump is more affordable than ever.  
  
So why?  
One line: You eat foods for living, not electrical devices.  
  
Ask yourself, how many percent of your grocery bill is for foods and how much is for non-food stuff?  
Averagely speaking, foods and drinks make up around 50-70% of your grocery bill. And in case you haven't noticed, almost all foods are made in the US. So tariffs don't affect foods at all, unless you eat imported wagyu beef for living. Tariffs will surely raise the cost of electrical devices, for instance, you can get a coffee maker for $20 for a good deal in retail stores, tariffs will raise the cost to somewhere like $40 or even $60. But remember, electrical devices when you buy them, you don't just eat them and buy another one the next day, they will last for at least a year or even years. So saving $20 or $40 a year doesn't sound much, but saving $1 for a Gallon of milk affects your life A LOT.  
  
Yeah you pay for $20 or $40 more on electrical devices for like...once a year? but in the return you are investing in American high wage jobs and American manufacturing industry.

  
Before Trump entered the political battlefield, both the GOP and Democrats had promoted tax plans that would mostly hurt Americans. The GOP promoted sales tax and flat tax hurting lower and middle class Americans while Democrats promoted inconsistent progressive tax that still generated most revenues from 1st, 2nd and 3rd brackets. But when it comes to tariffs, all of them will talk about tariffs meaning taxing Americans... So you mean taxing your own citizens is better than taxing foreigners? That's hypocritical.

  
As a Trump supporter, I do recognize that Biden kept a lot of Trump's protectionist policies. I will give him credit for that.

I saw that every origin was $4 a bag (again, this is 1972) EXCEPT FOR ONE... so I had to either pick one of the $4's at random or trust there was a good reason the outlier was $6. I decided on the $6.

So, I went home and ground the beans in one of those wooden box coffee grinders with the crank on top, put it in an aluminum Moka Pot and ¬° ¬° ¬° OMG ! ! ! it was extremely smooth and full bodied and just absolutely incredible, all in spite of the grinder and brewing method I used.

In the mid-1980's I went into a Coffee Connection (George Howell's first coffee venture) and asked ""Years ago I bought some Jamaica Blue Mountain and it was the best coffee I've ever had... can you find that for me?"". They told me ""Back then when you paid for JBM, you probably got JBM... today the annual sales of JBM is several times larger than the annual production \[do the math\]"" and ""We could order a 30lb bag for you but we cannot guarantee it's really JBM. We don't recommend you take that risk.""

So, as far as I know, that was the only time I had JBM.

Grinder anecdote: The grinder was bought at a garage sale from a High School classmate who had determined it wasn't capable of grinding Cannabis stalks and he had no interest in using it for coffee. I pulled the stringy stalks out of the burrs and used it for coffee for years. The seller was the son of the TV and B-Movie actor Stuart Whitman. When I retired that grinder it sat in my Boston Apartment, lined with coffee grounds. One day I picked it up and immediately discovered that literally hundreds of cockroaches had made it their home, apparently attracted to the grinds I had never bothered to clean out.",8,1731021788.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.75,False

1gm4690,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/1gm4690/the_science_behind_everyday_things_exploring_the/,The Science Behind Everyday Things: Exploring the Wonders Around Us,"Introduction

Have you ever wondered why your morning coffee wakes you up or how your Wi-Fi magically connects you to the world? Science is behind almost every ordinary thing we encounter daily, but it‚Äôs easy to take these wonders for granted. Let‚Äôs break down some common everyday phenomena and uncover the science behind them.

1. How Refrigerators Work to Keep Food Fresh

Refrigerators are an essential part of modern life, but few people think about the technology that keeps their food fresh. A refrigerator operates on the principles of thermodynamics, using a process called refrigeration to move heat from the inside to the outside, thus lowering the internal temperature.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
	‚Ä¢	The Refrigerant: The refrigerator uses a fluid called refrigerant, which absorbs heat as it changes from a liquid to a gas.
	‚Ä¢	The Compressor: When the refrigerant absorbs heat from inside the fridge, it evaporates and turns into gas. The compressor then compresses this gas, raising its pressure and temperature, so it can release the absorbed heat outside.
	‚Ä¢	Condensation: Once the gas releases heat, it condenses back into a liquid, which is cooled further and sent back into the fridge to start the process over.

By repeating this cycle, refrigerators keep the temperature low, slowing down bacterial growth and helping food last longer.

2. The Science Behind Common Myths: Does Sugar Really Make Kids Hyper?

The idea that sugar causes hyperactivity in children is widely believed, but science tells a different story. Numerous studies have shown no definitive link between sugar intake and hyperactivity. Instead, the ‚Äúsugar rush‚Äù phenomenon seems to stem from the excitement around eating sugary treats or being in social situations (like birthday parties) where sugar is often consumed.

Why the Myth Persists:
	‚Ä¢	Placebo Effect: Parents often anticipate hyperactivity after children consume sugar, leading them to interpret normal energetic behavior as a ‚Äúsugar rush.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Occasions Linked to Sugar: High-energy environments like parties and events, where kids are naturally excited, also tend to serve sugary foods, creating a misleading correlation.

While consuming large amounts of sugar isn‚Äôt ideal for anyone‚Äôs health, sugar itself is unlikely to make kids hyperactive.

3. Why Do Some People Experience ‚ÄúBrain Freeze‚Äù When Eating Ice Cream?

That sharp, painful sensation in your head after eating ice cream too quickly is called ‚Äúbrain freeze,‚Äù or more scientifically, sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia. It happens when something cold touches the roof of your mouth, triggering blood vessels in your brain to constrict and then rapidly expand, causing a burst of pain.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why it happens:
	‚Ä¢	Sudden Temperature Change: The cold sensation hits the roof of your mouth, and your body tries to warm up the area by sending an influx of warm blood to the brain.
	‚Ä¢	Pain Signal: This rush of blood can cause a rapid increase in blood flow and trigger pain receptors, which send a signal to your brain, interpreted as a headache.
	‚Ä¢	How to Stop It: Pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth can help warm the area, potentially reducing the pain of brain freeze faster.

4. Why the Sky Changes Color at Sunset

Watching a sunset is breathtaking, but what causes the sky to shift from blue to hues of pink, orange, and red? This phenomenon is due to Rayleigh scattering, which describes how light behaves as it passes through Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.

The Science Behind the Colors:
	‚Ä¢	Blue Skies: During the day, shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more in the atmosphere, making the sky appear blue.
	‚Ä¢	Sunset Colors: At sunset, the sun is lower on the horizon, so light travels through more atmosphere, scattering the shorter blue wavelengths out of view and allowing longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate.

This is why we see those warm colors during sunrise and sunset, adding magic to these moments of the day.

5. How Wi-Fi Works: Connecting Without Wires

Wi-Fi connects our devices to the internet without physical wires, but how does this happen? Wi-Fi relies on radio waves, which are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, just like visible light. Wi-Fi routers transmit data through these waves to connect our devices to the internet.

Key Components of Wi-Fi:
	‚Ä¢	Router and Radio Waves: Your Wi-Fi router uses radio waves to send and receive data to and from your devices, functioning as a mini radio transmitter.
	‚Ä¢	Frequency Bands: Most Wi-Fi operates on either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands, each with its own strengths in terms of speed and range.
	‚Ä¢	Decoding Data: Devices like smartphones and computers have built-in receivers that decode the data transmitted via these waves, turning it into the information you see on your screen.

This invisible network of radio waves has revolutionized the way we connect, enabling everything from online work to streaming.

Conclusion

Science explains so much about our world, from the functioning of household appliances to the mysteries of the natural world. By understanding the basics behind these everyday phenomena, we can appreciate the role science plays in making life more comfortable, enjoyable, and connected. So next time you grab an ice cream, scroll through social media on Wi-Fi, or watch a sunset, you‚Äôll know a little more about the magic happening behind the scenes.

With a blend of curiosity and science, there‚Äôs always something new to learn about our everyday world!",1,1731021461.0,Blogging,0,1.0,False

I'm pretty certain I'll be moving to Denver in the next couple of months, and will be spending some time in Airbnbs trying to narrow in on where specifically I'd like to be. Would love some help figuring out which areas specifically would make the most sense for me to check out as places I may eventually pick to settle in.

31 M, single. I work from home. COL isn't a huge issue for me, probably looking at $1800-2500ish for a 1 BR apartment/condo or some kind of townhouse with more space. Can flex up if needed for something nice though. Specific recs are appreciated!   
(I do have a car for whatever that's worth).

Things I'd like to have:

1. Overall I'd probably prefer to live 5, 10, 15 minutes away from the most bustling and lively parts of the city. I think that can mesh with the other stuff below too - prefer a bit of peace/quiet/solace but I'm single and looking to date, so I don't want to live totally on the outskirts or anything.
2. Modern builds, clean aesthetic (no trash on the streets) as far as architecture / cityscape.
3. I know this can be difficult in big cities and even highly variable/dynamic, but really not a fan of dealing with crazy homeless people. Have had a couple bad experiences when living in NYC/SF, and it's just something I'd like to avoid as much as possible.
4. Some proximity to greenery or nature would be nice - park, streams/rivers, trees on streets, etc. Somewhere with access to some good jogging or potentially cycling routes.
5. Walkability is a plus but it's Denver, so I'm not expecting too much and don't care to sacrifice everything else just for the ability to walk to a grocery store.
6. Speaking of groceries, I do like food/cooking - so having some bigger organic grocery stores or farmers markets nearby would be cool, and some restaurant scene within a \~20 minute drive is a plus.
7. Nightlife / social stuff - I don't go out a ton right now but would definitely like to be central enough to build a community and make some new friends.

Main activities/hobbies for me:

1. Staying active - powerlifting, soccer, tennis, golf, road cycling, whatever team rec sport leagues there are.
2. Winter - I do snowboard & ski, so I think the western half of the city probably saves me some traffic time getting to the mountains?
3. Enjoy going to local events like concerts, sports, festivals, art shows, etc when and where I can.
4. Good coffee shop / coworking scene is nice. I'm pretty entrepreneurial and like connecting with other builders through those types of places + events.
5. Apart from those I kinda just go with the flow and try to keep things novel to some extent over the days & weeks.

Areas I have considered (but completely open to feedback/adjustments - I'm not a local):

1. Lower Highlands
2. Sloan's Lake
3. Washington Park
4. North Cherry Creek area.
5. Berkeley

I feel more drawn to mountains and forests, like in NorCal or the PNW (minus the weather, of course üôÑ).

As a single guy, I also have to consider dating. Intelligence is a top priority in a partner, and after spending a month in SF and going on several dates, I was really impressed by the quality of people I met there. My experience in SD is more limited, but I question whether I‚Äôd find the same kind of connections there.

Thing is 2-3 hours ago I had some tiramisu my mom made and I'm afraid it brought back my urgency and I want to cry :(.

The tramisu had plenty of cocoa, a little caffeine and the ladyfingers were dipped in cognac but not that much. I don't even know which one of these bothered me, the amount of caffeine was too little and so was the alcohol and I remember drinking a cocktail back in August when I had symptoms and it didn't bother me at all so I don't see why it would bother me now.

>- **[Q3]  Monde Nissin looking to exit from Figaro...** According to **@mokongboy‚Äôs** report [[link](https://twitter.com/mokongboy/status/1854536200696320363)] on yesterday‚Äôs analyst briefing, **Monde Nissin** [MONDE 10.56 ‚ñº2.9%; 83% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=db9bf7abb2baa05fabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] is trying to ‚Äúlook for an exit‚Äù from its position in **Figaro** [FCG 0.85 ‚ñº3.4%; 65% avgVol]. The report said that MONDE had initially believed that FCG‚Äôs brand could ‚Äúhelp [MONDE] break into a new category‚Äù, but only discovered later that the ‚Äúpossibility is slim‚Äù for achieving this goal and that subsequent attempts to bring the FCG brand into the consumer segment has ‚Äúnot been successful.‚Äù MONDE acquired a 15% stake in FCG back in March 2023 for ‚Ç±820 million at ‚Ç±1.00/share. The company made these remarks as part of the Q[ 0.00 unch; 0% avgVol]A session that followed the 9M earnings call briefing. MONDE reported a 13.8% y/y decrease in Q3 net income to ‚Ç±2.0 billion due to impairment losses sustained while restructuring its alternative meat business. Despite that, the company‚Äôs 9M net income was up 5% to ‚Ç±6.1 billion. MONDE also said that **David Flochel** has been appointed as the new CEO of the Meat Alternative business, effective January 1.
>    - ***MB:*** First off, thank you to **@mokongboy** for the briefing report ([X link](https://twitter.com/mokongboy/status/1854536200696320363)) and to MONDE for the refreshing transparency. It posted the slide deck that it presented to analysts (select ‚Äúbriefing materials‚Äù in the [dropdown](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=db9bf7abb2baa05fabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)), and allowed regular investors to listen-in on the earnings call. While that level of transparency should be the enforced norm on the PSE, it‚Äôs important to recognize the companies that voluntarily give this level of access and information to their retail investor base. I might not agree with the decisions that the company has made with respect to its Meat Alternative segment or its initial investment in FCG, but if I were a shareholder, I would definitely appreciate hearing the management team providing more context on the thinking behind the FCG move, how it has largely failed, and what the team plans to do next. Companies shouldn‚Äôt be able to keep that kind of information semi-private by disclosing it only on zoom calls with the analyst community. MONDE is taking the lead on investor relations and I hope more companies follow its example.

>- **[Q3]  OceanaGold PH Q3 profit: $3.6M (up 620% y/y)...** **OceanaGold PH** [OGP 14.90 ‚ñº4.2%; 817% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2d4e254f30434f33abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q3 net income of $3.6 million (~‚Ç±210 million), up 620% from its Q3/23 net income of $0.5 million (~‚Ç±29 million), and down 74% q/q from its Q2/24 net income of $14.2 million (~‚Ç±827 million). Gold production was up 21% q/q, but still down 8% y/y. OGP attributed the quarter-on-quarter increase in production to ‚Äúincreased availability at the processing plant‚Äù, and the year-on-year decline to ‚Äúa major rain event‚Äù and changes that the company made to the mining rate in Q2. From a sales perspective, total gold sales in Q3 were up 52% q/q, at an average gold price of $2,511/oz. Combined, this resulted in a 27% y/y increase in revenue to $102.1 million. In the ‚ÄúGuidance‚Äù section, however, OGP said that it has updated the amount of gold it expects to produce in FY24. The previous annual production range of 120,000 to 135,000 ounces of gold has been adjusted down to 104,000 to 108,000 ounces. The downward adjustment was made due to the ‚Äúlower than expected mill performance in the second quarter‚Äù, and the ‚Äúbreccia stope redesign‚Äù.
>    - ***MB:*** It‚Äôs personally been frustrating to see these adjustments being made after the IPO. The pitch to investors was a relatively straight-forward one of estimated production, estimated gold selling prices, and dividends of 90% of OGP‚Äôs quarterly free cash flow. There‚Äôs a lot of complexity (and therefore, risk) behind that narrative, and we are seeing that play out a bit here as OGP has had to adjust its mining plans to account for safety concerns and updated information on the quality/grade of the ore it can access. To its credit, OGP said that production would increase in Q3 after that wobble in Q2, and it did increase by 21%. But I‚Äôve heard from some investors who are confused about the dividend, and in this regard, OGP is not doing its investors (or its investor relations team) any favors by not providing a clear free cash flow figure or performing the calculation for its investors. It performs the calculation for the portion owed to the government under its mining agreement, so I‚Äôd like to see this done going forward to help investors track and evaluate the actuals with their expectations. OGP is going to be one of our **MB Investment Month participants**, and I hope the company will address some of these concerns from your questions soon.

>- **[QUESTION]  What is an ‚Äúannualized‚Äù dividend?...** I got this question repeatedly yesterday after my story about **OceanaGold PH‚Äôs** [OGP 14.90 ‚ñº4.2%; 817% avgVol] Q3 dividend. In that story, I said OGP declared a ‚Ç±0.81/share dividend, and that this represented (at the pre-announcement price of ‚Ç±15.50/share) an annualized yield of 20.9%. Many readers were confused, since the regular equation to calculate yield (dividend / share price) would only be 5.2% in this case. That is true. For that one dividend, a buyer at ‚Ç±15.50 could expect a yield of 5.2%. But that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about when I‚Äôm talking about annualized yields. I‚Äôm trying to think of the OGP income stream as an on-going thing (something that will generate dividends every quarter), and I‚Äôm trying to come up with ways to compare the income that OGP generates to the income that other dividend companies like **Semirara** [SCC 31.95 ‚ñº0.8%; 68% avgVol] or **AREIT** [AREIT 39.70 ‚ñº0.1%; 178% avgVol] generate. The best way to do this is to take the most recent quarterly dividend and multiply that by four to say--in essence--‚Äùthis is what OGP‚Äôs annual yield would be, at this market price, if it did exactly this level of dividend for this and the next three quarters‚Äù. That‚Äôs what it means to ‚Äúannualize‚Äù a dividend. It‚Äôs not exact. It‚Äôs just a predictive tool that we can use to make a more ‚Äúapples to apples‚Äù comparison between different income streams.
>    - ***MB:*** For long-term investors, the real yield that matters is the one relative to your purchase price. If you bought OGP at its offer price of ‚Ç±13.33/share, then this dividend had an annualized yield of 24.3% for you. But I like to compute the annualized yield based on the current market price because investors can use this (as one tool) to identify ‚Äúdeals‚Äù if they‚Äôre in the market to buy dividend-generating stocks, and it can help me identify opportunities to add to any of my holdings.

1gm3q2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1gm3q2a/i_did_not_hire_people_to_think_for_themselves/,"""I did NOT hire people to think for themselves.""","""Finally, I have an employee who thinks for herself,"" she said to me in my second week. Frankly she wasn't wrong--my coworkers were nervous to do anything without her permission, and she was constantly stepping in to correct mistakes and redirect projects. But even in those early days, I suspected that she was creating an environment where we couldn't do anything without her. I ended up being right about that. She was a middle-manager for a small public agency. I was hired as a professional with several years of experience, but wasn't trusted like one. I just left this job last week, and am still processing the stress and injustice of it all. I just found this sub, and am fascinated to realize that so many of these narcissistic managers exhibit the exact same traits that mine did; did they all read the same playbook on how to be terrible? 

The most harmful characteristics of my boss, I think, are that she interpreted everything as a personal commentary about her, and that she had the power to punish people when she felt personally attacked. Which was often. Anything I did--from what I wore, to how I approached a project, to when I went to the bathroom--was somehow seen as a reflection of what I thought of her personally. Here are a few examples of her ludicrous micromanagement and emotional rollercoasters--in chronological order, because they got crazier with time:

* Week one, she got upset that I showed up to the office on a work day. We worked hybrid schedules, and she gave confusing instructions about what our schedules would be. (The confusing schedule changes continued the entire time I was there--she was constantly changing her mind, or switching people around to give the people she was mad at worse schedules, like having to come in on a Friday.) One day in my first week I misunderstood, and thought I needed to go into the office rather than work at home. She was furious that I...showed up to work? It truly made no difference whether I showed up to the office: I had my own desk, I had my own projects, we weren't public-facing, and we did most of our communication over Teams. She wasn't even in the office herself. ""I need to know where you are at ALL times,"" she said when she called. 
* She refused to schedule meetings. We had a small team of six, but she acted like meeting with us was a major inconvenience. ""I can't be held to scheduled meetings--my job is too fast-moving and demanding,"" she said. She preferred to call us at any time, often just to chat about her life or complain about someone else. If we were already on the phone with a client or a coworker, we were expected to hang up and answer her. One day I was working at home and was in the bathroom when she called an impromptu all-team meeting. When I didn't answer her call, she had my coworkers call and message me repeatedly so that I had ten missed calls and messages in the span of three minutes. When I tried to call her back, she didn't pick up and didn't respond to my messages for days. The point of the meeting? Telling us to read an email she'd sent about policy changes.
* Bizarrely aggressive opinions, and no respect for time. She called me one morning to complain about the milk that a coworker brought in for coffee. ""I can't believe he likes 2%. That stuff is crap. Tell him to stop bringing that crap in."" I alternated between telling her that I would not be telling this coworker to stop bringing in his own milk, trying to redirect the conversation to being about work, and just answering emails. I finally checked the clock and realized she'd been talking to me about this for a full hour. 
* The micromanagement: she got into a spreadsheet I'd made to organize the RSVP list for an event I was running, and wanted me to reorganize the sheet to her liking. She didn't tell me this one directly though; she had her flying monkey call me. ""Just wondering why you highlighted these names in purple--please change them back to white. Please delete so-and-so's name off of the list because we know they'll be there and they don't need to be on the RSVP list."" That entire event was a success in spite of her intervention--not because of it.
* Her paranoid assumption that somebody was always watching and judging was intense. The day before this event, I was outside measuring our office courtyard. We were going to have multiple booths in a small space, and I wanted to make sure that everything fit without issue. The flying monkey came out. ""Just wondering what you're doing out here?"" When I explained, he responded, ""Well you can't be out here. Please come back inside."" I was flabbergasted. ""It looks bad for you to be out here with a tape measure. You can't be seen doing this--what if upper management saw you out here? Not a good look."" I asked him to clarify: what exactly ""looked bad"" about me measuring the courtyard? ""It looks like we don't know what we're doing if we have to measure. Just come inside; I'm only passing along orders."" 
* Another example of the paranoia: the day of that event, she watched a coworker and I talking from her office window, and threatened us to stay away from each other. This was a coworker she personally didn't like. ""Stay away from her--she's toxic,"" she said to me. My coworker called to warn me of what my boss had said to her. ""If I find out the two of you were complaining about me, you're going to be in big trouble."" I knew I had to leave after this one. 
* Knowing I wasn't going to be staying much longer, I did try to talk to my boss gently about the issues I was experiencing, to see if there was a reasonable human in there. I wrote notes, and spent hours of my weekend preparing for this talk. I got input from friends. I started with, ""When you hired me, you said that you wanted an employee who would take initiative, be self-directed, and would think for themselves."" She interrupted me right away. ""I never said that last part, and I never would say that. I did NOT hire people to think for themselves."" She was an expert at re-writing history and twisting what was said--she said you shouldn't put anything in writing, ever. She'd pick apart how you said something as a distraction from actually discussing the main issue. Beyond that, I think her statement speaks for itself: she does not want employees who think for themselves. That conversation lasted two hours. She rambled in circles. ""I can't believe you tried to pull this on me. I'm going to ding you for this."" I asked her to clarify: ""Ding me? Like punish me?"" She stood firm. ""Yes. I'm going to ding you."" 

She did punish me. It sucked. Reluctantly, I got HR involved. HR got her boss involved. They were all apologetic, but as unhelpful as you might expect. I had my own documentation of events in writing, but very little that was strong enough to incriminate her. As my boss told me in her last angry call to me, ""It's your word against mine."" I didn't care to have a huge, drawn out fight, and I knew that my coworkers were too consumed by surviving to come forward with their own examples. They did take away some of her direct reports, and for the last two weeks of my employment she rearranged her schedule to never have to see me again.

But the last day that I had to work with her in person, she left me with this little gem: getting offended that I wore the shirt she told me to wear. She insisted we wear company t-shirts once a week, all together. Again, we were not public-facing, and other departments didn't have to do this. Our boss just decided one day that we six needed to wear a company shirt. We had a long sleeve company t-shirt, and a short sleeve company t-shirt. She didn't care which shirt you wore: as long as you wore one of the company shirts, it was fine. But this day she decided I was wearing the wrong one. I wore the long sleeve shirt, and she came in and remarked to my coworker, in front of me, ""I don't remember giving her permission to wear the long sleeve shirt today. We're all in the short sleeve shirt and she doesn't match us."" Then she ran an office poll amongst my five coworkers to see if they would all wear the long sleeve shirt next week. \\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/

There's so much more, but I'll stop there. Thanks for reading. I realized that my health, creativity, and confidence were worth more to me than that paycheck, and I'm lucky to be able to go back to freelancing while I figure out what's next. I'm enjoying having my time back, and not looking over my shoulder all day while I wait for the dreaded Teams call about her mindless aggravations of the day. I'm sorry for those of you who have worked or are still working for a narcissistic manager. They often attract great, kind, conscientious workers who will make them look good.

Today‚Äôs a bit special‚ÄîI‚Äôm off to NYC to attend the World Forum for ServiceNow! üöÜ

The drive to 30th Street Station was perfect. The sun was just rising, the sky was clear, and a pleasant breeze accompanied me as I drove from Jersey to Philly. Normally, November is chilly, but today surprised me‚Äîit was unusually warm for this time of year! üåû It‚Äôs those little moments that remind me to pause and appreciate the journey.

Today was a bit different from my usual routine; instead of my favorite Starbucks, I settled for a Dunkin‚Äô coffee. Some of my friends jokingly call it ‚Äúduplicate coffee‚Äù (no offense, Dunkin‚Äô fans! üòÖ) but hey, it‚Äôs what was available.

On the train, I ended up sitting next to someone who was also headed to the same conference. We got talking, and it was fascinating to hear about their journey with the Now platform. It‚Äôs moments like these that make trips memorable‚Äîconnecting with others on similar paths. ‚ú®

Arriving in New York City was a shift in energy, as always. The city has its own vibe: people rushing, life moving at a fast pace, everyone wrapped in their own world. New York is a place where you can feel the heartbeat of ambition. People are driven, eyes focused, and each person has a story, a purpose, a reason for moving so quickly. There‚Äôs a kind of electric excitement in the air, a rhythm that‚Äôs uniquely New York. üèôÔ∏èüíº

Finally, I reached the World Forum (more on that in a future post‚Äîstay tuned!). It‚Äôs inspiring to be among so many passionate people, all gathered to learn and share ideas.
