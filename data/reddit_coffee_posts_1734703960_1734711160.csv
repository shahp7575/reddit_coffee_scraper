I‚Äôm going through a really difficult time and could use some advice. Recently, I relapsed into self-harm because of guilt and unresolved feelings for someone I have a big crush on. I think my feelings might even be limerent. I‚Äôm friends with them on Facebook and have their phone number, but they‚Äôre in a long-term relationship. I know not to interfere, but it‚Äôs been incredibly painful to navigate these emotions.

What‚Äôs been haunting me is that during a past bipolar episode, I did some things that directly affected them. They don‚Äôt know I have bipolar, and I‚Äôve been beating myself up over my actions ever since. The guilt has been overwhelming, and I can‚Äôt seem to move past it.

To thank them for helping me during a fire in my apartment complex, I invited them and their partner out for coffee. They politely declined and suggested I organize a group gathering to thank everyone who helped instead. They mentioned they might attend, but it felt like a subtle way of avoiding a one-on-one meeting.

I took their suggestion and started planning the group event, but the feeling of rejection really stuck with me. I can‚Äôt stop thinking that I‚Äôve negatively affected them to the point where they don‚Äôt want to spend time with me‚Äîor that their partner might know about my past actions and doesn‚Äôt want us meeting together. I might be overthinking it, but it hit me hard.

Since then, I‚Äôve been spiraling. I‚Äôve started self-harming again because of how angry and disappointed I am in myself. I‚Äôve been ruminating constantly, even dreaming about them. A couple of days ago, I broke down crying at work because I felt so consumed by guilt and anger at myself.

I don‚Äôt know how to stop this cycle of self-harm and self-loathing, and I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs only going to get worse. If anyone has advice on how to stop self-harming or manage these feelings of guilt and rumination, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I feel so stuck, and I just want to find a way to move forward.

I stated thanks and told him the real notes. I said thanks because he usually is unwilling to verbalize what my perfume smells like. He got upset because he was wrong about the notes and I said he has a ""bad sniffer"" and that started a fight. He said he felt like I was saying he was wrong and that it made him feel not good enough. But what's wrong with being wrong about a smell? What's wrong with not being able to distinguish between smells? It literally doesn't define your character or your likeablity if you can't smell. 

Well he said it's like calling someone a ""fatty"" because it's something they can't change. Personally I think there's a huge difference between calling someone fat and saying that can't smell well but maybe I'm wrong? 

He said it hurt his feelings and makes him not want to answer what my perfume smells like. He also states it makes him want to avoid talking to me. He said that it feels like my expectations of himself feel like he just needs to suck it up

I'm not gonna lie I feel he's being sensitive and that he's unable to accept anything other than compliments to feed his low self esteem. That he can't handle anyone saying anything negative about him and it makes me feel like I'm walking on egg shells and I don't exactly understand why he's upset.

Hi Reddit,

I recently got two dental implant crowns on teeth #9 & #10. It‚Äôs been only a day since the placement and maybe It‚Äôs my brain playing tricks on me but I think the shade is slightly too bright. My dentist sent back my case last month because she felt they were too light but after sleeping on them for a day I still think that‚Äôs the issue at hand. I also got a veneer from the same lab on #26 and I also think it‚Äôs a little too light. It‚Äôs important to mention I do drink coffee every day and try to use a straw when I can and swish with water after drinking it. I‚Äôve become very self conscious about my teeth since I got dental implants due to an accident but I‚Äôm feeling very defeated about the situation. I spent $10k on these crowns and custom abutments because my former dentist used PFM crowns in the front teeth and overall didn‚Äôt make a comprehensive treatment plan. My fear is that I I go back to my dentist and we send them back and then they‚Äôll be too dark. Would it make sense for me to use at home whitening to try to lighten all the other teeth?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

After undergoing teeth whitening, many people wonder how long they should wait before enjoying their favorite coffee again. This is a common concern as coffee is known for its rich flavor but also for its propensity to stain teeth over time. When you have just brightened your smile, it‚Äôs essential to protect it from potential discoloration. Understanding the relationship between teeth whitening and coffee can help you enjoy both without worry.

Generally, it is recommended to wait at least **24 to 48 hours** after a teeth whitening treatment before consuming coffee. During this initial period, your teeth may be more porous and susceptible to staining. Here‚Äôs why you should wait:

- **Porosity:** After whitening, the enamel on your teeth may be slightly more porous. This vulnerability means that staining drinks like coffee can seep into your teeth more easily.
- **Sensitivity:** Many people experience increased tooth sensitivity after whitening. Drinking hot coffee too soon can exacerbate discomfort.
- **Optimal Results:** To keep your new smile looking its best, waiting helps ensure that the whitening effect lasts longer without being compromised.

During the waiting period, consider switching to alternatives to coffee. You can try tea, herbal drinks, or clear liquids instead. If you must drink coffee, opting for iced coffee can be a safer choice right after your treatment, as the temperature is reduced, which may lessen sensitivity.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
When you do return to drinking coffee, there are effective strategies to minimize the risk of staining:

- **Use a Straw:** Drinking coffee through a straw can help bypass your teeth, reducing direct contact and potential staining.
- **Rinse Your Mouth:** After consuming coffee, rinse your mouth with water to wash away any staining particles that may cling to your teeth.
- **Choose Light Roast:** Lighter roast coffee tends to have less tannin, which minimizes the risk of staining compared to darker roasts.
- **Limit Additives:** Adding cream or milk may help reduce staining, and they may also provide relief from sensitivity.

Other factors influence how long you should wait before indulging in coffee after teeth whitening. The type of whitening treatment (in-office vs. at-home) can make a difference. In-office treatments usually utilize stronger bleaching agents, meaning you might want to wait longer before drinking coffee compared to at-home treatments. Consult your dentist for personalized advice based on the method used.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Aside from coffee, various other foods and drinks can stain your teeth as well. To protect your bright smile, it‚Äôs wise to avoid or minimize consumption of:

- Red wine
- Dark sodas
- Black tea
- Berries
- Sauces like soy or marinara

Taking care of your teeth after whitening is essential for prolonging the effects of the treatment. Regular dental hygiene practices like brushing twice a day and flossing daily contribute to maintaining your results. You may also consider using whitening toothpaste gradually after the waiting period. However, such products should not be used immediately after treatment, as they can irritate sensitive teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
If you're still curious about the specifics of your teeth whitening session, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to your dentist. They can provide personalized timelines and advice based on your needs and treatment type. By following these precautions and waiting the recommended time before you sip that cup of coffee, you can enjoy your beverage without compromising your brighter smile.

Waiting 24 to 48 hours after teeth whitening before drinking coffee is advisable. This small adjustment can help safeguard your investment in a whiter smile while ensuring that you enjoy your favorite beverage comfortably and safely.

Tips for Maintaining Teeth Brightness After Whitening Treatments
----------------------------------------------------------------

After undergoing teeth whitening treatments, maintaining that bright smile is key to feeling confident and attractive. The foods and drinks you consume can play a significant role in how long your results last. Here are some practical tips to help you keep your teeth bright and shining after whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Watch What You Eat and Drink

Some foods and beverages can stain your teeth, dulling the brightness achieved from whitening. Be mindful of the following:

- **Coffee:** This popular drink is notorious for staining teeth. If you must have your cup, consider using a straw to minimize contact.
- **Tea:** Just like coffee, dark teas can leave unsightly stains. If you enjoy tea, opt for lighter varieties like green or herbal.
- **Red Wine:** While full-bodied reds are delicious, they can quickly undo your whitening efforts. Limit intake or choose white wine instead.
- **Foods with Strong Pigments:** Foods like blueberries, blackberries, and tomato sauces can also contribute to staining. Enjoy these in moderation and consider rinsing your mouth with water afterward.

### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

Maintaining your bright smile starts with your daily dental care routine. Follow these tips to keep your teeth clean and vibrant:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brush Regularly:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste. Make sure to use gentle strokes to avoid damaging your enamel.
- **Floss Daily:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles stuck between your teeth, preventing staining.
- **Use Whitening Toothpaste:** Consider using a toothpaste designed for maintaining whiteness. These often contain gentle abrasives to help keep your smile bright.
- **Consider Mouthwash:** An antibacterial mouthwash can help tackle plaque and bacteria, while some brands offer options specifically for whitening.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water is essential for oral health. Water helps rinse away food particles and acids that can contribute to staining. It‚Äôs a good idea to sip water throughout the day, especially after consuming beverages known to stain teeth.

### Limit Smoking and Tobacco Products

If you smoke or use tobacco in any form, it‚Äôs time to consider quitting. Tobacco products are very damaging to your teeth and can cause significant staining. By quitting, you not only keep your teeth brighter but also improve your overall health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Schedule Regular Dental Check-Ups

Regular visits to your dentist can help maintain your bright smile. Dentists can provide professional cleanings and check for early signs of staining or decay. They can also give you advice tailored to your personal dental needs, helping you keep your teeth looking their best.

### Consider Touch-Up Treatments

Sometimes, the effects of at-home whitening can fade over time due to diet or lifestyle. If you notice your teeth losing their brightness, consider professional touch-up treatments. Your dentist can guide you on the best options for whitening touch-ups.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Use Protective Solutions

Some products can help protect your teeth from staining. Here are some recommendations:

- **Straw Use:** When consuming beverages that can stain, try to use a straw. This minimizes contact and helps keep teeth whiter.
- **Whitening Pens:** These handy tools can be used for touch-ups and quick brightening on the go.
- **Sealants and Treatments:** Ask your dentist about options for sealants or protective treatments that can create a barrier and help resist stains.

By following these tips for maintaining teeth brightness after whitening treatments, you‚Äôll be able to enjoy your smiles with confidence for longer. It‚Äôs all about being proactive and mindful of what you are consuming while keeping up with your oral hygiene routine. A luminous smile is not just a luxury; it can be a lasting part of your everyday life!

### Conclusion

Understanding the right time to enjoy your coffee after teeth whitening is crucial for maintaining that bright, new smile. After undergoing any whitening treatment, it's generally recommended to wait at least 48 hours before sipping coffee. This waiting period allows your teeth to re-mineralize and minimizes the risk of staining. Your newly whitened teeth are particularly porous immediately after treatment, making them more susceptible to dark beverages like coffee.

To keep your teeth shining bright after your whitening session, consider adopting a few key habits. First, try to use a straw when drinking coffee; this can help limit direct contact with your teeth. Additionally, rinse your mouth with water right after enjoying your coffee to wash away any residues that could lead to discoloration. Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential, so continue to brush and floss regularly, using toothpaste designed for sensitive or whitening care.

You can also explore maintaining brightness with dental check-ups and professional cleanings. Moreover, consider scheduling your whitening treatments before important events, allowing time for your teeth to settle from the treatment before indulging in staining foods and drinks. With these simple strategies, you can enjoy your favorite beverages without compromising the brilliance of your smile. Prioritize your dental health, and your confident, radiant smile will surely follow.

3. Farmers market
4. Park
5. Grocery store (lmao)

I‚Äôm staying at my brothers now and I got a new house as I stated before in a small town it‚Äôs a nice house. Big house. Probably too big just for me. lol. But I don‚Äôt move in until the 28th and it‚Äôs a 2 hour drive from my brothers so the church I found to be a part of I have to wait before I can join that community. 

I just need some tips and tricks for fighting this loneliness and whirlwind of emotions. Any suggestions will be welcome please. It‚Äôs a battle to not hop on tinder to look for someone just to go for a coffee with me lol. I also work remotely on cyber security so I‚Äôm in this room all day.

1himlq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1himlq4/struggling_with_cooking/,Struggling with cooking,"As the title suggests, I struggle with cooking. I've seen this a common thing with having one or the other and seemingly becomes even worse when you have both. I'm a 32M and weigh 123lbs. I dont have family to rely on and I don't qualify for any assistance because ""I'm not autistic enough"". My PCP and Psychiatrist are concerned about my weight. But I just can't cook and ive told them that! It's like a giant nope wall of severe executive dysfunction and fear shows up in my brain the size of Mt. Everest. Let me break down my thoughts on said wall:


Prep time: too much cutting, forming of food, prepping of food, wasting too many dishes in a tiny kitchen in a 1 bed, 1 bath apartment 

Dangerous tools: knives and needing to be Hella focused or you can chop your finger off, or cut yourself and get blood everywhere. Even using a cheese graiter is scary, sliced skin off on one before.

Wait time: Having to wait for food to be done when I'm hungry NOW. Having to babysit food, as in stir on occasion or continuous stirring.

Cleaning: constantly wash your hands because everything has bateria and germs that can get you severely sick if you dont wash your hands every time you touch an ingredient, the god awful amount of dishes to clean, especially if meat is involved and requires bleach to disinfect, mess with/on the counter and stove top, and needing to take my garbage out every other day as opposed to 1-2 times a week.

Needing/Losing time: time i can spend doing things like drawing, going for a walk, gaming, setting aside recording time for my podcast and audio and video editing for my podcast, responding to text messages.

But buying cooked food is expensive and I don't have that kind of money as I don't make much and can barely afford my apartment right now as is. And things like Hello Fresh and Factor are also expensive and I've heard it's hit and miss in terms of some people getting expired looking food or food poisoning so that scared me also. Frozen foods are processed and have exessive amounts of sodium in them and that's too unhealthy for Day to day consumption. I only eat apples, toast, crackers, strawberries (freezedried and normal), dried mango slices, pre-washed salads, eggs, ham and cheese sandwiches, PB and J sandwiches, hot dogs, chips and occasionally frozen Pizza rolls. And the occasional fast food maybe once a week. And I drink Water, instant coffee, orange juice and occasionally milk.

How have you overcome the onslaught of thoughts to cook and feed yourself to stay healthy? I can't do it, no matter how hard I try and I'm unmedicated because meds don't work for me and give me mood swings and make me not me. Yes, I've tried lots of meds.

The part that tricked me:

>*Exactly once*¬†during a race, a program may¬†*disable collision*¬†for up to¬†*2 picoseconds*. This allows the program to¬†*pass through walls*¬†as if they were regular track. At the end of the cheat, the program must be back on normal track again

I read this as:

>*Exactly once*¬†during a race, a program may¬†*disable collision*¬†for up to¬†**and including** *2 picoseconds*. This allows the program to¬†*pass through walls*¬†as if they were regular track. **After** the end of the cheat, the program must be back on normal track again

  
So, I wrote a solution for finding the length of cheats where you could walk for **up to n steps inside the same wall.** 

And it took me a while to understand what was wrong with my answers compared to the example and why it did not include all the good cheats I found. 

Then I started to wonder why the text says ""up to 2"" if it means ""exactly 1""... was I the only one confused by this?

In the end I thought my own imaginary problem was more interesting than the actual parts today, so have a go at solving it if you like =)

‚ÄúOh baby your back early, I thought you were going to swing by the coffee shop on the way home to get us some christmas hot chocolate?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh it was closed, huh that's a shame I was looking forward to it, they always make it  really nice but never tell me how they do it , I might go down while I'm out tomorrow and get us some if they're open‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh yes I'll make sure to get you your  meat hamper while I'm down there, I know you paid extra to get the one that's mostly bacon‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh speaking of meat, I may or may not have had a suspicion that the store would not not have been open today and i also may or may not  have spent the day cooking you your favourite meal‚Äù


‚ÄúYes I made you steak,ribs,chicken ,sausages and of course‚Ä¶bacon‚Ä¶you know I love you but even for a werewolf I think you like meat just a little too much hehe‚Äù

‚Äúoh yes you do in fact I can prove it‚Ä¶come sit on the sofa with me, come on don't be stubborn, the foods still cooking So we have plenty of time‚Äù

(Pause)

‚ÄúOk now close your eyes and keep them closed at least until I start, no I'm not going to slap you dummy, no I'm not going to eat your food either, wow your proving my point without me even having to do anything‚Ä¶just shh and let me do what I'm planning to do ‚Äú


‚ÄúGood boy/girl‚Äù

(Scalp scratching noises throughout section )

‚ÄúAww,  look at that you pretty much just melted, who's a good werewolf?, hehe that's right you're a good werewolf but not only that‚Ä¶your my good werewolf‚Äù

‚ÄúHehe I should make you walk around the house while I do this to you, you'd make a wonderful feather duster with that wagging tail you've got‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't you try to be offended, you know it doesn't work when I'm doing this to you, you love it far too much to pretend you don't‚Äù

‚ÄúNow for my test‚Ä¶.I can do this for you for the next hour or‚Ä¶ I can get you a nice big plate of bacon‚Äù


‚ÄúEep‚Ä¶ haha see what I mean you don't even try to pretend you don't love food over everything else‚Äù

‚ÄúOh really you're just hungry today is all?, you are such a liar, if you were just hungry   one mention of food wouldn't make you  leap over the sofa and stand looking into the kitchen like you're starving, are you my boyfriend/girlfriend or my puppy?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh oh yeah that's right your both ‚Ä¶.ok I'll get you your food, it should all be done by now anyway but you need to go sit at the table like a normal person and wait for it, I will not be pounced on,  now go and sit down  you big furry garbage disposal (giggle)‚Äù


‚ÄúOK here's your plate‚Ä¶wait‚Ä¶you don't eat until I get a photo understood?, because The next time you tell me and our friends and family that you don't like meat that much I'm going to show them this picture as proof that your a big furry liar‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd there we are, ok baby you can eat now‚Ä¶try not to choke though I can't do anything to help you in this form if you do , i mean my arms can't even reach more than halfway around you so unless you want me having to jump on your belly like a trampoline eat slowly‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh good boy/Girl‚Äù


(Pause)

‚ÄúAww I'm glad you enjoyed it baby it took a while for me to make for you so I'm glad that you actually Did like it‚Ä¶no I will not make it for you again tomorrow, if anything you should be the one making me my favourite meal not the other way around‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh yay , you're not allowed to take that back you know, tomorrow your gonna spend the day making me all of my favorite food and when I come back you're gonna play with my Hair all night long‚Äù


‚ÄúHehe I wondered if you'd  figure it out That quickly, yes baby I'm going to spend the rest of your night giving those soft fluffy ears of yours all of the scratches that they can handle‚Ä¶maybe even more than that if your extra Good hehe‚Äù

‚ÄúAww you can't deny it cutie you know you love my mean scratches, the ones that get you panting like the good little puppy you really are, the way they make your leg kicking is so cute I can't imagine how good that must feel for you‚Äù

‚ÄúHehe well of you're extra good for me and follow all of my instructions‚Ä¶I'll make sure my scratches are extra mean tonight but that's not all‚Ä¶you'll even get belly rubs‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's right, So are you gonna be my good boy/Girl and clean up the Plates?, go on then quickly but don't break anything I know how clumsy  you get when your rushing heh‚Äù

(Pause)


[Script gets somewhat Spicy from this point ]



‚ÄúOK so I want you to lay down on your back and stay nice and still for me ok?, nope no tail wagging and no leg kicking, not until I tell you otherwise, be my good wolf until then baby‚Ä¶if you want to get sessions like this then You have to be obedient During them you know this‚Ä¶don't make me punish you i don't think i have enough itching powder to do it properly ‚Äù


‚ÄúGood puppy now let's start up here on your ears ‚Äú

(Hair scratching)

‚ÄúMhm I just know that feels so good, I bet you want to move so badly‚Ä¶such a shame that you can't especially when I move my scratches behind them to your favorite spot right about‚Ä¶.here‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm this seems a little bit too easy, I think I'll move down to this big furry belly of yours and let my nails give you some scritches just..like..this‚Äù


‚ÄúOoh that got a really big reaction this time ‚Ä¶you keep those arms up mister/missus or this gets worse‚Ä¶.you know it can so don‚Äôt test me‚Äù


‚ÄúHehe you're so cute tensing up like this just to keep those natural puppy responses at bay‚Ä¶it's so much fun watching you fight them I forget why we don't do this more often‚Äù


‚ÄúOh yeah that's right, The last time I tried more than one in a week you got so frustrated and needy that we broke the bed hehe, fair enough but I don't remember giving you permission to speak did I puppy?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's what I thought, so now I have to punish you don't I?, uh uh I don't want excuses,i want you to ask me to do it, I want you to ask me to punish you for speaking without My permission‚Äù

‚ÄúHey keep that tail still I said no wagging‚Ä¶oh you're definitely getting punished‚Ä¶either ask for it or I use the powder on your paws ...yes I know you hate having itchy paws but that's the point of a punishment Isn't it?‚Äù


‚ÄúAww you want me to punish you after all?, well if you want me to do it so badly of course I will baby ‚Äú


(Salt shaker/powder shaking sounds)

(Small pause)

‚ÄúAnd that's all of the powder in place on your hair and ears as well as being on your belly just to make it really bad for you‚Ä¶well if you didn't want it there you shouldn't have told me about your itchy belly when we were first dating‚Äù

:Now I'm going to go to the store and pick up some more of that powder since we've run out but I also need some more stuff while I'm out so I'll go get those as well. I should only be an hour or 2, possibly 3 at the most if I get distracted ‚Ä¶and while I'm out you're going to stay right here and not move, understand?, no itching or trying to make it itch less in any way, if you can do this then your punishment is over and i will itch all of those itchy spots until you howl, but if you don't then the punishment will continue until tomorrow but I will tie you down and powder your paws this time, so will you be good while I'm out?‚Äù


‚ÄúPerfect then see you later puppy‚Äù


(Pause)

(Door opening and closing)

‚ÄúPuppy I'm home, sorry I took longer Than I said I would but I ran into Katie and we ended up going for a coffee,  how are you doing I hope the extra hour didn't make your challenge any harder than it already was‚Äù


‚ÄúAww there you are still on the bed‚Ä¶did you move while I was out puppy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo?, well let me just take a look at you and I'll see for myself hmm""hmm it looks like you were Good for me, perfect, well now that your punishment Is over I can do this‚Äù

(Kissing noise)

Whispered:‚Äù did you have Fun baby?, I didn't go too far did I?, i know you wanted me to me meaner when we did this but i hope i didn't go a little too far down that path, i  really didn't mean to take so long and you know Katie she just doesn't stop talking, she's lovely but wow an hour extra on my trip was not what i needed today‚Äù

‚ÄúOh good well I'm glad you liked it, maybe next time I'll go on a vacation hehe, ok ok I'm only teasing you baby I'm not that cruel and I'll prove it to you because you must be so itchy by now right?‚Äù

‚Äúaww really it itches so bad does it?, well in that case here let me help you in the best way I know how‚Äù

(Hair scratching until the end)

‚ÄúHehe yes you can move again baby, I swear people would think I'm the one that sets up these sessions and it's not you asking me for them hehe‚Äù

‚Äúaww there's that tail wagging again‚Ä¶I bet you'd love this every day no matter how needy it got you‚Ä¶heh I knew it‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh well I'm glad you like when I'm in control baby, i like it as well even if it does take some effort for me not to melt when you whimper like you do , speaking of whimpering, this powder is completely  through your fur, you're going to need a bath soon‚Ä¶yes you will or this will keep itching forever and I know you don't want this to go on forever even if you do like the reward hehe ‚Äú

‚ÄúConsider it an order if it helps baby‚Ä¶hehe of course that worked, why is it always the big strong people that are the biggest subs‚Äù

‚Äú ok I'll itch you for an hour  so you can really enjoy it , But then you're gonna go wash it out, no more questions on the matter ‚Ä¶good boy/girl‚Äù

‚ÄúOh and by the way they had a sale on so I bought a ton of extra strong itching powder‚Ä¶how about we make christmas a very, very white christmas this year?‚Äù

At the beginning of the year I was sitting at the PC and suddenly felt an extremely strong pain in my back, or rather deep in my body, but it was more on the back.
This pain can best be described as a kind of lightning strike, after which I felt very strange and had a pulse of 150-160 for 2 hours.
Since that day things have gone downhill.
I no longer felt comfortable in my body and realized something was strange and the symptoms started.

Day by day my symptoms got worse, I got sibo and unexplained adrenaline rushes, fibromyalgia type pain and other things like :

Tachycardia,bed lean,pounding headaches,can't sweat except hands and feet permanently,extreme muscle weakness,diarrhea - constipation,tremors like Parkinson's,insomnia and restlessness,heat and cold intolerance,fatigue and at the same time like on cortisol or adrenaline, permanently similar to when the body is constantly under stress like overstimulation, extreme sleep disturbances, the feeling of not being right in my body, adrenaline surges, body longs for sleep but is stopped by hormones or sympathetic nervous system, muscle twitching, no appetite, tingling hands, dry mouth and nose, Complete lack of drive, restless legs, cold sweaty hands and feet, dizziness, sometimes real shortness of breath, finds it difficult to walk straight, internal trembling, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, pale face, shivering as if I were cold, discomfort in the form of tingling on the skin or heat attacks, extreme hair loss, burning tongue, histamine intolerance, nausea, concentration disorders, brain fog so strong that I have forgotten my own name, tinnitus, weight loss 40 kg since May, funny fat stools, no more quiet minutes, body is permanently as if under severe stress, finds absolutely no more rest.

I wonder what happened at that moment, is a nerve pinched or irritated in some way?

I am bedridden because something in my body tells me that I have no energy, no rest, as if I lack the drive but still permanent turmoil...

The funny thing is when I was already feeling very bad I drank a coffee, it must have triggered something in my body through the caffeine, after that I felt halfway normal for 3 hours, not like completely normal but much better, the anxiety was gone!
Then it subsided again and everything got worse.

I think I don't have enough endorphins or something ....

Has anyone experienced something similar?

I'm on the lookout for someone ordinary ‚Äì someone who can be my partner-in-crime, my confidant, and maybe a bit more, if everything works out. But I'm not in a hurry. I believe in taking things slow, like taking our time to build a connection and get to know each other.

So, what exactly am I seeking? Well, I crave deep conversations and witty banter. I want someone who isn't afraid to open up to each other's emotional insecurities, trauma, let's just try to be real with each other, also someone who can match my curiosity and sense of humor (the darker the better). 

When it comes to interests, I appreciate art of all kinds, I have a deep appreciation for psychedelic art and music. I'm a big arsenal football club fan, also I'm a huge mental health advocate, let's be kind to each other. I enjoy watching critically acclaimed TV shows. I'm fueled by coffee and driven by guilt. Currently on a fitness journey, Trying to be regular at the gym and eating healthy, I would love it I f we could exchange healthy cooking recipes.

But enough about me ‚Äì I'm very much interested in learning about you. Your likes, icks, tics and everything else. Let's even share our playlists. I would be more than happy it if you could give skin care and hair care tips. 

So, if you're up for intellectually stimulating conversations, sharing funny anecdotes, a genuine connection that transcends the superficial and dives deep into the essence of our beings or simply enjoying the silence of a comfortable conversation, I'm here for it all. Looking forward to hearing from you. Do write me back!

Please help - we're moving in less than a week. I have booked us an airbnb in Capitol Hill. I need to find us an appartment (2brd ideally) in a good neighbourhood.

We're a married couple, mid/late 30's, Australian & Canadian , big outdoor-sey folks, music, food, coffee and bookstore lover's

Enjoy a cool bar, fun pub or quirky cocktail place, craft beers, any nooks or creative places, as I've been living in France for a long time -- i'd love a clean, safe place with green grass around.  
Have been researching so much neighbourhoods pros/cons, best recco's but am still confused, plus ppl are talking alot of how 'dangerous, or semi-dangerous downtown seattle has become recently - is this true and if so, where should we avoid? My partner is chinese, and just saw the horrible news of a male bus driver being murdered in University District.  
Hear a lot of talk btw Capitol Hill, Fremont and Bellevue ...that being said.. anywhere near the lightrail would be ideal as we travel a far bit and not astronomically expensive where Macca burgers become a stapel source  
Also any recommendations on good safe, good quality gyms??

Appreciate any feedback given.  
Cheers everyone,",2,1734708990.0,AskSeattle,8,1.0,False

1himcnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1himcnn/moving_on/,Moving on ,"So, my ex broke up with my the Saturday just gone, and I was absolutely devastated. It was a long distance relationship over 3 years, with everything i was working towards, was to move to Germany to be with her.  I was a wreck for the entire weekend. Then I made the decision to just get on with life. I've been to the gym and for a swim every day this week, going for breakfast and a coffee most days, going to the pub just to be in a social setting and for the hussle and bussle. I've been for a 3-4 long weeks this week too. On one of those walks, I deleted all of our photos together on my phone, because they kept on popping up and it destroyed me to see constant reminders, and see how beautiful she is. 

6 days post breakup, I don't feel anywhere near as bad as I thought I would. When it happened, I didn't know how to cope or anything. I imagined I'd be in a state of constant grief and mourning for ages. I've spent a lot of time talking to family and friends. Is it wrong to feel this 'okay' this soon? I know there will be ups and downs, some days will be shit, other days will be good. I almost feel guilty a little bit. 

Asides from the usual feelings, I feel like something is out of place in me. Something that isn't usually there, or I haven't noticed before. It doesn't feel malicious, but it doesn't feel good. 

I don't feel like I've been ignoring my feelings or the grief, because it does overcome me at times. Is it okay to be feeling okay this soon after quite a sudden, traumatic breakup? ",1,1734708896.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I opened TikTok and saw a gay couple taking pictures in a photo booth. That‚Äôs when the question hit me: ""What went wrong in my dating stages this year?""

Then a realization struck hard‚Äî they only wanted me for my body.

I met guys both organically and through dating apps, and all of them had one thing in common: they went cold after getting what they wanted from me. I've been on countless dates and talking stages this year (I know, it was an attempt to fill the void). We had great conversations and went on coffee dates, BBQ dates, ice cream dates, etc., but it always ended up in bed. Afterward, they either got distant or will only reach out when they felt horny. Tangina, naging parte na talaga ako ng food chain.

Looking back, I realize I was wrong to think that giving them my body would make them stay. I let them use me, ignoring my own boundaries. It saddens me because I know I can offer so much more than my body. I have a great personality, I can share my hobbies, I have a good sense of humor, I can cook meals, and I have so much love to give.

But I also realize it‚Äôs my fault for allowing this to happen‚Äîit was within my control. Still, I couldn‚Äôt help it. I craved affection so much that I let people use me and overstep my boundaries.

1him9ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1him9ct/its_been_almost_a_decade_and_dozens_of_drug/,"Its been almost a decade and dozens of drug protocols from different docs, but I am now finally getting 8+ hours per night. ","So I have had crap sleep for most all of my adult life. It started to get bad during graduate school but after the wife and I started having kiddos things accelerated significantly. It's odd, but I can't even remember now when I actually slept at night like a 'normal' person at night. Seems like another lifetime ago. 

Over this time period of roughly a decade I have been prescribed just about every drug protocol imaginable. It started out with the more tame varieties before eventually stepping up to Benzos, which also had limited effectiveness and I spent the better part of a year having to ween off of after becoming physically dependent upon them.  That shit was pure hell, but that is a story for another time. 

In 2024, clear of the benzos finally, I had pretty much given up all hope. I figured it was just going to be same ole, same ole. So OTC sleep aid pills, lots of melatonin and magnesium supplements, and lots of staring at the ceiling at 2 AM each night and playing on my phone while trying not to disturb my wife sleeping next to me. My issue has always been staying asleep more so than sleep induction. And once I wake up its game over. I averaged like 2-3 hours per night, and that shit catches up with you quick. 

So my primary care doc of the last several years finally retired so I had to hop on board with a new doc. This is a pretty small town so its not like I had many options, and besides I primarily just see my family doctor for bloodwork once a year anyway so it was no big deal. After the nurse left and the new doc came she asked about my persistent insomnia issues. It was at this point that I laid out the long and winding tale. Given my vast history of failure on other drugs for insomnia she suggested a different approach by way of a drug called Phenobarbital. This is a drug I had never heard of before, but it apparently is primarily used in the treatment of epilepsy and not often prescribed for insomnia indications anymore. The drug was not without its risk, but like with benzos these risks could be managed with close medical support and adherence. Having nothing else to lose i said fuck it. I had to drive like 45 min to find a pharmacy that had it in stock however after she wrote the script. 

So I am now on my second week since I got home with this drug and I am averaging 8ish hours per night now! Imagine my jaw dropping amazement! It has been so long since I had a full night of rest that I forgot what it feels like. So my observations from this 'new' drug (which was actually discovered well over a century ago):

\-Onset begins rapidly, within one hour. More or less time of onset based upon if there is any food in your system. 

\-Once you are out, you are out. World War 3 going on outside your window is still not going to wake you up. This is a tad concerning for me since we had children in this house. My wife was able to rouse me one night last week when our youngest was sick, but it was not easy. Like not at all. Don't take this until and unless you can be fully committed to 8 hours of sleep. 

\-There is lingering effects the next day. I am told this will subside as I grow more accustomed to the drug, but definitely need an extra cup of coffee or an expresso in the AM now to get the cobwebs out. 

\-At least according to my apple watch my REM and 'deep' sleep is much more pronounced on this drug than with Benzos. ",4,1734708642.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1him4cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExamEscape/comments/1him4cx/creating_a_sleep_routine_6_steps_to_better_sleep/,Creating a Sleep Routine ‚Äì 6 Steps to Better Sleep,"# Creating a Sleep Routine

Establishing a sleep routine that works for you helps you get the recommended amount of sleep each night. Sleep routines are activities before bed each night. Routines can improve the quality and length of sleep. Getting a good night‚Äôs sleep is essential to maintaining long-term healthy eating and physical activity habits. Good sleep is free and is perhaps the most budget-friendly step you can take toward wellness. Even a simple step added before bed can help you on your path to better sleep. When creating your routine, consider the following:

# Set up a healthy sleep environment ‚Äî make sure the bedroom is comfortable and relaxing

* Keep the noise level low and the room dark and cool
* Add white noise (fan, humidifier, or noise machine) if it is too noisy or too quiet
* Turn off or put away anything that will get in the way of your sleep
* Take TVs and computers out of the bedroom
* Keep pets in a crate or outside of the room
* Keep your bed as an area just for sleeping

# Maintain a consistent sleep schedule ‚Äî keep the same bedtime schedule on both weekdays and weekends to keep your circadian rhythm in check

* Create a bedtime routine (shower, pajamas, and brush teeth)
* Be sure to set a time for ‚Äúlights off‚Äù
* Avoid afternoon naps if it makes it difficult to fall asleep at bedtime
* Set bedtime routines for children and encourage a regular sleep schedule for other family members. It will make it easier for you to follow.

# Establish an electronic curfew ‚Äî technology before bed can make it difficult to sleep because the blue light from screens (TV, tablet, smartphone, or laptop) disrupts the release of melatonin in your body

* Set up an electronic curfew, a time in the evening when all TVs, phones, and computers need to be turned off. This should be at least one to two hours before bedtime.
* If you enjoy reading before bed, opt for printed copies of books, newspapers, and magazine rather than reading on an electronic device.

# Reduce caffeine and other substances ‚Äî caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter medication, and a heavy meal may make it more difficult to fall asleep, so avoid these items before bed

* Caffeine is found in coffee, black, white and green tea, hot cocoa, lattes, espresso, chai, iced tea, soda, energy drinks, and chocolate.
* Avoid eating large meals two to three hours before bed. If hungry, opt for a light snack of protein and complex carbohydrates, such as a piece of whole grain toast with peanut butter, fresh fruit, or oatmeal.
* You may fall asleep quickly after a glass of wine, but you are likely to wake up before you have had a full night‚Äôs sleep.
* Over-the-counter sleep medications initially may help you fall asleep. However, your body can develop a tolerance to these medications quickly, and they lose their effect.

# Avoid physical activity right before bed ‚Äî physical activity can energize the body and raise body temperature making it more difficult to sleep

* Being physically active earlier in the day will help you meet your physical activity goal and will also help you sleep better.

# Choose calming activities ‚Äî pick something that is soothing and relaxing

* Read, listen to music, do gentle yoga or stretching, reflect on the highlights of the day, think about something positive you are going to do tomorrow.
* Practice deep breathing for relaxation: inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Count your breaths and start back at one if you lose count.
* Do progressive muscle relaxation, a technique where you focus on one part of your body at a time, tensing and relaxing muscles until you have relaxed your body.",1,1734708258.0,ExamEscape,0,1.0,False

1hilvnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/riotgames/comments/1hilvnz/fairplay_toxicity_free_environment_those_are/,"fairplay, toxicity free environment. those are terms Riot has no idea of their actual meaning. ","I'm average valorant player who's recently started enjoying swiftplay mode more and more. because it is less stressful , more calm , with normal people around wanting to just have fun and don't care whether they win or lose. HOWEVER, there is always atleast one or two players once every few games who just can't handle their ego and can't control themselves when they start losing in swiftplay mode, Or even better , people who can't recognise joke over serious statement or toxicity.  

Me and others can't enjoy the game , not only that but also , i got unfairly banned because one of those people. 

What did i do? nothing **objectively** wrong. 

How do I know? I asked people in game.

And what did Riot (valorant support) say? ""our desicion on suspending your account is reasonable and we will not change the status of your account"" 

Why did they say it? - Well maybe because their individual childhood traumas and biased opinions based on insecurities and antisocial personalities won't let them aknowledge the true meaning of what I actually said/done. (speculation, not claim) 

Context : I was enjoying a match in swiftplay mode , my teammate was a little bit tryhard and the enemy couldn't handle that my teammate was just simply better than the enemy. **The enemy** then **started** **being toxic, calling my teammate names , slurrs and stuff purely because the enemy player couldn't handle losing a game of swiftplay**. So I just said to that enemy player **to stop being toxic because they re embarrassing themselves**. To admire my teammates performance and stay quiet. **Then a bit later i added they should screenshot of they ve been saying the whole time and reflect on their behaviour when they calm down**. (the stuff he said didn't even make sense). I finished talking to him by saying he would 'die of cringe' after he reflected on his behaviour.  and then i **muted and reported** the enemy player.

**I admit, I said it using different words. But still didn't use slurrs , didn't use abusive language AT ALL !!! I used normal , generally acceptable words to describe enemies behaviour and to let him know he should reflect upon his behaviour. I have multiple recordings of other players saying , there was nothing wrong with what I said. And I continue gathering more and more opinions on the stuff I said. So far 100% of people AGREED WITH ME !!! More than one person said ""i hope they unban you"" ""because you didn't say anything wrong""** 

Few minutes later i got banned for one month. Support refuses to get back to my case. They say I should **""take this time as an opportunity to reflect on my behaviour"".** So instead of apologizing , unbanning me. They have the balls to even be toxic and tell me to reflect on my behaviour **which is** **TRYING TO STOP** toxic person from being toxic??? **So for trying to help community to be better and less toxic**. I receive a ban and provocative message to not do it? So being toxic is the way to exist here? 

  
**I DEMAND APOLOGY FROM RIOT , FROM VALORANT SUPPORT AND  FOR MY ACCOUNT TO BE UNBANNED !!** 

**I have people on my side, and even after my ban expires i will continue gathering the opinions of people about what is and what is not acceptable. until you finally realise , you re bunch of toxicity feeding socially awkward people and you have to change your stupid ways of controlling and suspending !!** 

  
I haven't done anything wrong. Yet the support said 'we are closing this case and our decision is definitive'. - So it doesn't freaking matter whether **YOU MADE A MISTAKE** or not. You get to decide when it's time to dismiss someone's case**?**  So when normal player , A person who feeds your greedy mouths, makes a mistake - that means you can ban them forever BUT when **YOU MADE A MISTAKE** , you can just pretend that you didn't and move on **? !!** 

hello? what is this kind of 'support' ? So not only you wrongfully ban people, but **you also refuse to take responsibility** for it? hiding behind what? cuz i ve been banned before, and somehow it's always something different. I'm talking about the way your employees review the cases. IN THIS CASE the only way they could feel right about their decision is by taking context of ONLY PART OF WHAT I ACTUALY SAID and somehow magically come up with the idea that it was inappropriate to say it. 

**YES , reader, THEY ONLY TOOK SOME PARTS OF WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID AND CREATED A TOXIC CONVERSATION OUT OF IT !! !!** 

**Reader,** do you remember how I mentioned ""i told the toxic player to reflect on their behaviour""? well the so called ""support expert"" didn't bother looking at that part of conversation. But at the same time , I've been once told that their job is not to review the context. Which should mean that I was banned based on what ?! I tell you what they decided to ban me for, the so called 'expert' banned me because that day , their coffee was not hot enough !! So they don't judge based on context , but they can MAKE UP their own 'context' and not only that , they can freely decide based on their biased opinions and ideologies what is and what isn't toxic word. If I was wrong , with what I just said, I would've never been banned. !!!

100% of asked , responded 'no' to a question 'would you ban me if you were riot?' or atleast didn't say no, because i gave option to simple not answer. The data show , that your community **is** totally OK with what I said back then to the toxic player. So that means only THREE THINGS - **1.** **THE PLAYER REPORTED MY TEAMMATE BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY ANGRY BY BETTER PERFORMANCE OF MY TEAMMATE, AND BECAUSE I SIMPLY TYPED ANYTHING IN THE CHAT, I GOT REPORTED ALONGSIDE MY TEAMMATE. (i wouldn't be surprised if that toxic player has reported all of our team that day).** 

**2.** **YOU ARE ABUSING AUTHORITY AND DENY ANY MISTREATMENTS, ANY MISTAKES !!!**

","I remember this being a young Asian woman getting burned inside the MCDs when she accidentally spilled her coffee on her lap while having breakfast with her 6 yro son. She and her young son were all over the news. I vividly remember thinking, how could people not know that coffee is super hot? Then I remember thinking that they might not usually eat at MCDs. I did. Especially breakfast. 

Like people even poured out a bit to allow the coffee to cool faster and maybe add cream/sugar. I also remember that back in 1992(ish), iced coffee was just starting to become trendy because of Starbucks. So the whole thing, while a terrible accident didn't make sense. 

Besides her age at the time, Stella Liebeck isn't Asian and she was with her grandson in their car when the incident happened. 

I looked and no other coffee burn accidents fit my description of events. 

Does anyone remember the young Asian woman or is it just my mind messing with me?",0,1734707557.0,MandelaEffect,10,0.18,False

I got the big P about 1.5 weeks back Alhamdulillah

Honestly I dont want to do a long detailed write up but i guess ill just do it

It was a 2 year journey (on and off) and it was mostly off atleast the first year because i couldnt balance med school and the prep 

Anyway, I still did pathoma religiously and loved everything about it. Dr Husain is amazing and the way he explained made it super easy for me and honestly i built my foundation just through this (because my actual foundation was weak ash) 

First Aid. Read it i dont remember how many times but F everyone (respectfully) who says its not to be used as a primary source. I will go to war against anyone who says otherwise. 10/10 

Mehlmann. My guy saved me so much i cant even explain, did all of his youtube playlists and his pdfs about twice or thrice 

Never used BnB never liked it 

UWorld about 60% done 

Now comes the NBMEs and Free 120s And please im not trying to give false hope or anything im just being honest here 

I never scored more than 59% on any nbme and got a whopping 50% on the New Free 120 just 2 days before the real deal I was completely shattered honest to God but i didnt want to push it further and deep down I knew that if i could manage the time on the real deal and take the test with a calm mind i could turn this around because when i reviewed my mocks and saw the silly mistakes i realized that i could easily score atleast 70% if i was just focused (i guess thats what i get for my ADHD ass) Anyway i just kept reviewing my NBMEs and Free 120 on the last day and did some ethics and NBME HY pics ( btw please do this pdf because i think i got a few repeats )

TEST DAY EXPERIENCE I think it was a blessing in disguise that my exam was scheduled to be at 11:45 am Alhamdulillah because i could never have woken up at 6 and not feel drunk for an 8am exam

My first block went complete bollocks i couldnt tell what was experimental and what wasnt , the length of the qn didnt bother me because i was mentally prepared for them to be a Kilometer long After my first block (i had flagged around 20ish and ran out of time) i almost shat my pants thinking if this is the beginning then imagine the rest of it. I got up and went to the washroom and gave myself a pep talk that i could still turn it around i only really needed to manage time and try and flag less than 15 qns every block ( i know it sounds stupid and ridiculous and funny that i HAD to flag less than 15 qns because obv it ain‚Äôt in my hand, but trust me on this, my brain somehow switched to super focused and genius mode that it saved me Alhamdulillah) Block 2-6 went smooth (the qns were literally almost similar in difficulty to the first block or atleast thats what i thought and thats only and only because of the  pep talk i gave to myself after the first block, i flagged around 16-17 max 19 qns from block 2-6, i took about 5-10 mins break after every block) Then comes block 7, mind u I‚Äôm getting overconfident and i had to calm myself and went to the washroom and pissed like a horse i could honestly smell all those energy drinks and coffee and washed my face with ice cold water (not out of choice, the water was super cold i screamed ) and came out and reminded myself that this is just another block and i need to flag as minimum questions as possible And Alhamdulillah block 7 also went smoothly but mentally i wasn‚Äôt okay still because i had this exact same feeling of overconfidence and ‚Äòexam went good‚Äô after all my mocks and failed all of em so i didn‚Äôt feel good at all Whichever qn seemed hard i just automatically assumed it to be experimental and honestly there were some obvious experimental questions because jt was all heliographic I came out of the test thinking it was a dream because it was dark outside ( i finished by 7pm ish) and couldnt think much of the test For the next 3.5 weeks ( yes because Thanksgiving delayed my result) I prayed religiously and left it all to Allah and kept tawakkul, i did lose hope ngl but i just kept praying and stayed busy

 I was shivering on the Wednesday i was gonna get my result literally all tremors thought i had sydenham chorea from RHD , was on my Mac and downloaded the score report and was to scared to open it and saw the blue color filled page from the bottom icon of downloads ( fellow Mac users will know what im talking about) and i got a lil courage and opened the pdf and saw the big P Alhamdulillah, i was still shivering for an hour after it ALHAMDULILLAH IT FEELS LIKE A BIG WEIGHT HAS BEEN LIFTED OFF ALHAMDULILLAH

NOTE: THIS POST IS NOT MEANT TO GO AGAINST THE NORM OF SCORING 65% ON NBME AND PLEASE STILL STICK BY IT I JUST WANTED TO BE A LITTLE RAY OF SUNSHINE TO ALL MY FELLOW REDDITORS WHO ARE SCORING LOW 

The only reason i think i was able to pull this off was ofc because of Allah and also despite the bad marks in mocks i was strong mentally during the test Alhamdulillah. I thought it was all just talk when people advised me about not losing ur shit during exam but boy is it true. U can be shitting ur pants but if u know those pants are black and not visible to anyone ull be fine (except it might stink and ull probably still not be fine) (ignore whatever i said) I acted like my NBMEs were in the 70s and constantly reminded myself that i could do it i just need to stay focussed and i pulled it off Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah for everything

And please ask me if u guys need any advice/help",11,1734707408.0,step1,12,1.0,False

1hilsmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1hilsmn/15_months_in/,15 months in,">TLDR; My story: how depression started, how I got prescribed, first impressions, side effects, dosage and how it helped.

Following this subreddit ever since I started and one thing I noticed is that the majority of posts are from people just starting out, asking the same questions about alcohol, side effects etc. I thought I would share what I went through after a bit more than a year.

First, why am I on this med? Well, from as far as I can remember, something always felt off with me. I was really anxious as a kid and as I grew up I learned to live with the anxiety. In my 20s though, I started having short bouts of depression, mostly in winter. I tried many things, started taking long walks, taking vitamins, exercising, etc, but the depression would come and go until I felt it was part of my personality almost. By my late 30s, I was feeling down more often than not, and my head was filled with pessimistic ruminations. 

I felt like most of my days consisted of mood management: make sure to exercise today, eat your veggies, go outside, drink lots of water, avoid alcohol, work on your hobbies, see your friends. I had a checklist of things to do to keep my head above water. But once I turned 40, I couldn't manage. It was summer, the sun was shining, and I was in my dark room avoiding all social situations. It was time to seek help.

I first emailed a bunch of psychologists. I had no health insurance, and no idea where to start. Most of them couldn't take new patients, and the ones that could would only do it virtually. I work from home and was already isolated as it is, so i really wanted to meet the psychologist in person... I decided to talk to my doctor, I figured he could do some tests, figure out if I had seasonal depression, chronic depression, maybe something hormonal or some vitamin deficiency, maybe a personality disorder, and get the healing process started. Instead, he prescribed me Wellbutrin.

I started out at 150xl. I definitely had the honeymoon period. I was smiling, bursting with energy, being social. I was blasting through work and finishing personal projects. I was waking up early in the morning happy to take on the day and the ruminations stopped.

The side effects were tolerable: at first I was a bit jittery, constipated, and I felt pressure and ringing in my ears. My memory was also a bit affected as I would sometimes search for words or have to think for a while when someone would ask me what I did last weekend for example. It felt like the meds were keeping me grounded in the present, but without the constant ruminations in my head, I wasn't holding on to the memories as much... if that makes sense. I also felt my eyesight diminishing, but that could also be due to aging, although the timing was suspicious.

**I would drink here and there, and sometimes get drunk. Never felt like I could have a seizure, but my tolerance lowered and the hangovers were brutal. I drink one or two coffees per day no problem. Did not lose weight.**

A few months in, a psychologist reached out to me. She had availabilities but only virtual. Fuck it, I'll give it a shot I thought. After 5 sessions at 200$ per session (from my own pocket) I called it quits. It felt good to talk to her, but she wasn't giving me any tools, insights, nothing. She was mostly listening. Imagine you have a back problem and you go for a massage: it feels good, but it won't fix your bad back. That's how I felt about therapy. 

As the side effects faded, so did the honeymoon. Still, I was a lot better than before so I kept at it and worked on getting my life where I wanted it to be. 5 months in, I had a depressed week. Two months later, I had another. So my doctor upped my dose to 300xl.

At first, I felt dumber and cloudheaded. Then I had another short honeymoon period, then it stabilized. I'm on my 4th month of 300xl and here are my thoughts:

* I am rarely depressed
* I should really take an eye exam
* If i'm tired or hungry, the cloud headedness comes back
* Short term memory is what's worrying me the most
* My ears are still ringing, and I feel pressure in them
* I have more headaches than before
* Hangovers are still brutal, and I only need 3 drinks to get them
* Since I started I was able to sucessfully write and perform a best man speech at my friend's wedding (something that was stressing me out quite a lot), I organized and went on my first overseas solo trip, and started dating again. I was able to push through the death of my dad without falling too deep into depression and I'm positive the meds helped me with that.

So what's next? Should I take this indefinitely? Should I lower the dose in spring and eventually stop? I'm just worried if there's long term consequences to taking this. When I talk to my doctor about memories or cloud headedness, he just says it's stress. 

Long term users, please share your journey!",4,1734707314.0,bupropion,1,1.0,False

***Community Notes on X quickly rebuffed a propaganda and censorship piece written to attack gamers and support Sweet Baby Inc. that was published by Game Developer and written by Bryant Francis.***

***Game Developer reposted an article written by Francis and titled ‚Äú***[***Why are Valve and Discord permitting harassment against Sweet Baby Inc.?***](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-)***‚Äù that was published by Game Developer back in March.***

***In the article, Francis falsely claims that ‚ÄúSweet Baby Inc. has become the target of an online harassment campaign for its consulting work on games like Alan Wake 2, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.‚Äù***

***As for why he claims this is happening he explains, ‚ÄúUsers on websites like Twitter and Kiwi Farm ‚Ä¶ have singled out the agency for allegedly having overarching influence on these games, and accused it of forcibly injecting a ""political agenda"" into them by advocating for diversity.‚Äù***

***He then claims this is all a ‚Äúgrim conspiracy theory built on out-of-context comments and a deliberate misreading of their mission statement, as well as racism, homophobia, and other layers of bigotry.‚Äù***

https://preview.redd.it/lo8tw0i9p08e1.png?width=1639&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b472fa5a00c20b6348002c7ecf394b2b4fe945e

***However, this is not a conspiracy theory and people are not taking Belair‚Äôs comments out-of-context.***

***In a 2019 Game Developer‚Äôs Conference presentation, Belair was quite clear what her company‚Äôs goal was, ‚ÄúNone of what we‚Äôre doing is about ticking boxes or about a veneer of wokeness. We actually have to care about making this stuff.‚Äù***

[***https://youtu.be/GfMsxjWgUbI***](https://youtu.be/GfMsxjWgUbI)

***She also encouraged employees in AAA to terrify their upper management so they will hire woke consultants like her to wokify the games.***

***She said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre creative working in AAA, which I did for many years, put this stuff up to your higher-ups. And if they don‚Äôt see the value and what you‚Äôre asking for when you ask for consultants, when you ask for research, go have a coffee with your marketing team and just terrify them with the possibility of what‚Äôs going to happen if they don‚Äôt give you what you want.‚Äù***

***‚ÄúBecause they have to consider‚Äì I say that out loud as a joke, but it‚Äôs actually very, very true because if you start to consider the people who are player and audience facing and you have to deal with mitigating harm and with keeping the sentiment around their game and their project positive, there‚Äôs like a genuine value that you could impress upon them both ethically and financially. You could say this is important,‚Äù she said.***

***Belair elaborated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a valid discussion to have because if you‚Äôre working with a thin narrative budget and you work in AAA, I think you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised or dismayed by the amount of money that marketing can give you.‚Äù***

***Since the publishing of the article, it‚Äôs also been revealed that Sweet Baby Inc. wanted to burn the video game industry to the ground.***

***A Sweet Baby Inc. employee, who uses the name Camerin Wild, gave a presentation at The Game Developers of Color Expo. On one slide titled, ‚ÄúCool, so why am I here?‚Äù a bullet point states, ‚ÄúBurning the games industry to the ground.‚Äù***

***Furthermore, the so-called harassment campaign that Francis claims Sweet Baby Inc. has been subjected was actually a harassment campaign against Brazilian gamer KabrutusRambo and was started by Sweet Baby Inc. employees.***

***Another Sweet Baby Inc. employee Chris Kindred targeted the Steam curator group and KabrutusRambo‚Äôs personal Steam account writing on X back at the end of February, ‚ÄúThe Steam curator harassment group Sweet Baby Inc detected is lead by this person, kabrutusrambo. Here‚Äôs them trying to be slick so they don‚Äôt get reported. Even with the discriminatory language filed off, the group itself still fails the code of conduct.‚Äù***

***Another Sweet Baby Inc. employee Maya Kramer also called for ‚Äúthose with authority‚Äù to step in and censor the Steam curator list.***

***Kramer wrote on X, ‚Äúsorry no one thing has changed: the number of people who understand that spreading misinformation just lets them be racist in public with no consequence has increased dramatically. that has changed. probably requires some fighting from those with authority! probably. :(‚Äù***

***She added, ‚Äúfor example, Steam doesn‚Äôt have guidelines for curators (as far as i can tell) that would prevent someone from starting a curation group that focuses on, say, SweetBabyInc and‚Ä¶warns people to not buy games they‚Äôre associated with? which could just list any game at all??‚Äù***

https://preview.redd.it/afe3pve3q08e1.jpg?width=552&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e3ff37af2dfbcc8e0fa637385fb41b6943d4636

***Despite much of this evidence already being apparent at the time of publishing, Bryant ignored it and called for Steam and Discord to censor Brazilian gamer KabrutusRambo, who created the Steam curator.***

***He wrote, ‚ÄúThe steps both companies have taken to moderate these groups appear to have had some effect, but allowing them to remain online serves the organizers' overarching purpose: recruiting ‚Äònormies‚Äô with little knowledge of game development to capitalize on their anger and channel them into directing hate speech toward Sweet Baby Inc. and anyone else pressing for inclusivity in video games and beyond.‚Äù***

***‚ÄúIf those loopholes aren't closed, those bad actors will have learned they can target other developers, and this will be the beginning of another massive hate campaign that will leave our industry and its people worse for wear,‚Äù he concluded.***

***Given all of this evidence, Game Developer‚Äôs repost of the March article was quickly community noted. The company initially posted, ‚ÄúWhen Sweet Baby Inc. was targeted for their advocacy efforts earlier this year, a Discord server and a Steam community group played a role in their harassment. We ask, do Valve and Discord consider this within their terms of service? #GDBestof2024.‚Äù***

***The Community Note responded, ‚ÄúIt does not violate Valve and Discord TOS, as the main goal of the server is simply listing out games that SBI is involved with. On the other hand, SBI employees who targeted that discord server and it's owner had violated a bunch of TOS.‚Äù***

Ah, coffee. That magical elixir that jumpstarts our mornings and fuels our afternoons. But let's be honest, sometimes that delightful aroma comes with a less-than-delightful after-effect: bad coffee breath. It's a common woe that can put a damper on even the most caffeinated of conversations. So, how do we combat this aromatic adversary? This article will delve into the science behind coffee breath, exploring its causes, and offering practical solutions to keep your breath fresh and your coffee dates worry-free. We'll cover everything from the basics of oral hygiene to dietary tweaks and even some quick fixes for those on-the-go moments. So buckle up, coffee lovers, and let's conquer bad coffee breath together!

Decoding the Mystery of Bad Coffee Breath
-----------------------------------------

Before we dive into solutions, let's get to the root of the problem. Why does that delicious cup of joe sometimes leave our breath smelling, well, less than delicious? Understanding the underlying mechanisms will help us choose the most effective strategies for combating the issue.

### The Science Behind the Stench

Coffee breath isn't just about lingering coffee aroma. It's a complex interplay of factors, including the coffee itself, our oral bacteria, and our individual body chemistry.

- **Dry Mouth:** Coffee is a diuretic, meaning it encourages fluid loss. This can lead to a dry mouth, which reduces saliva production. Saliva is crucial for washing away bacteria and food particles, so a dry mouth creates a breeding ground for odor-causing microbes. Think of it like a garden without rain ‚Äì things get a little‚Ä¶ ripe.
- **Sulfur Compounds:** Coffee beans contain sulfur compounds, which are released during the roasting and brewing process. These compounds, while contributing to the rich aroma of coffee, can also linger in the mouth and contribute to unpleasant breath. It‚Äôs a classic double-edged sword.
- **Bacteria's Feast:** The residual coffee particles and sugars in your mouth provide a feast for bacteria. These bacteria break down the coffee compounds and release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the primary culprits behind bad breath. It's like throwing a party for your mouth's least favorite guests.
- **Porous Surfaces:** Teeth have microscopic pores that can trap coffee particles and stains. These trapped particles become a breeding ground for bacteria, further contributing to bad coffee breath. Imagine a sponge soaking up coffee - not exactly a fresh scent.

### Identifying Your Coffee Breath Culprit

Not all coffee is created equal when it comes to breath impact. Different roasts, brewing methods, and additions can influence the intensity of coffee breath.

- **Dark Roasts:** Dark roasts tend to produce a more potent breath odor due to the higher concentration of sulfur compounds.
- **Additives:** Milk, cream, and sugar can exacerbate the problem by providing additional food for bacteria. A sugary latte might be delicious, but it‚Äôs also a recipe for a smelly situation.
- **Brewing Method:** French press coffee, with its unfiltered nature, can leave more residue in your mouth, increasing the likelihood of bad breath.

Banishing Bad Coffee Breath: Effective Strategies
-------------------------------------------------

Now that we've uncovered the science behind the stench, let‚Äôs explore some practical and effective strategies to banish bad coffee breath for good.

### Hydration is Key: The Power of Water

Staying hydrated is paramount in the fight against bad coffee breath. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps to wash away coffee residue and stimulate saliva production, keeping your mouth fresh and your breath clean.

1. **The Rinse and Repeat:** After enjoying your coffee, rinse your mouth thoroughly with water. This simple act can make a world of difference.
2. **Water, Water Everywhere:** Keep a water bottle handy and sip on it regularly throughout the day, especially after your coffee fix.

### Oral Hygiene: Your First Line of Defense

Proper oral hygiene is the cornerstone of fresh breath. It's not just about brushing ‚Äì a comprehensive approach is needed to effectively combat bad coffee breath.

1. **Brush Like a Boss:** Brush your teeth for two minutes, twice a day, using fluoride toothpaste. Pay attention to the gum line and the back of your tongue, as these areas can harbor odor-causing bacteria.
2. **Floss is Your Friend:** Flossing daily removes trapped food particles and plaque from between your teeth, preventing bacterial growth and bad breath.
3. **Tongue Scraping: A Game Changer:** A tongue scraper can effectively remove bacteria and debris from the surface of your tongue, significantly reducing bad breath.

Bad Coffee Breath: Dietary Tweaks for Fresher Breath
----------------------------------------------------

Beyond hydration and oral hygiene, certain dietary choices can further enhance your breath-freshening efforts.

### Foods That Fight Back

Certain foods have natural breath-freshening properties and can help neutralize coffee breath.

- **Crunchy Fruits and Vegetables:** Apples, carrots, and celery act as natural scrubbers, helping to clean your teeth and stimulate saliva production.
- **Herbs and Spices:** Parsley, mint, and ginger are known for their breath-freshening qualities. Chewing on a sprig of parsley after your coffee can be a quick and effective fix.
- **Yogurt:** Yogurt contains probiotics, which can help balance the bacteria in your mouth and reduce bad breath.

### Foods to Avoid

Just as some foods can help fight bad breath, others can exacerbate the problem. Limiting these can contribute to a fresher mouth overall.

- **Sugary Treats:** Sugary foods and drinks feed the bacteria in your mouth, leading to increased production of volatile sulfur compounds.
- **Processed Foods:** Highly processed foods can leave a lingering odor in your mouth.
- **Garlic and Onions:** While delicious, these pungent foods can contribute to lingering bad breath.

Bad Coffee Breath: On-the-Go Solutions
--------------------------------------

Life is busy, and sometimes we need a quick fix for coffee breath. Here are some on-the-go solutions for those moments when you need fresh breath fast.

### Quick Fixes for Coffee Breath

- **Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva production, helping to wash away coffee residue and neutralize odors. Opt for gum containing xylitol, which has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth.
- **Breath Mints:** Breath mints can provide a temporary burst of freshness, masking coffee breath in a pinch. Choose sugar-free options to avoid feeding the bacteria in your mouth.
- **Portable Mouthwash:** A small bottle of alcohol-free mouthwash can be a lifesaver when you're on the go. Swish it around your mouth for 30 seconds to freshen your breath instantly.

Bad Coffee Breath: When to See a Professional
---------------------------------------------

While the strategies outlined above can effectively manage coffee breath in most cases, persistent bad breath could be a sign of an underlying oral health issue. If you experience chronic bad breath despite practicing good oral hygiene, it's important to consult a dentist or doctor.

Conclusion
----------

Bad coffee breath, while a common annoyance, is a manageable problem. By understanding the science behind it and implementing the strategies discussed in this article, you can enjoy your coffee without worrying about offending anyone's olfactory senses. Remember, a combination of hydration, diligent oral hygiene, smart dietary choices, and quick fixes can keep your breath fresh and your coffee dates worry-free. So, go ahead, savor that cup of joe ‚Äì you've got this!

People are naturally the most critical of themselves. Even in times when you think you acted strangely, it‚Äôs doubtful anyone else even noticed. Being yourself is not only less stressful for you, but it also helps you find like-minded people, and eventually form friendships. ¬†

# Ask questions¬†

Asking genuine questions about your potential best bud is a great way to see into their inner world. It will also make them feel connected and appreciated. Try asking at least one follow up question to show you‚Äôre engaged and listening. ¬†

# Practice repetition and proximity¬†

There‚Äôs a lot to be said for showing up and sitting in the same spot weekly. You will naturally form bonds with the people who sit around you. Small talk turns into coffee runs, which turns into activities on the weekends, which turn into lifelong friendships.¬†

# Participate and get involved¬†

Not only does participating help you make friends, but you can also learn some new skills along the way. Signing up for¬†athletics,¬†events, the¬†First Year Experience Program,¬†volunteer opportunities,¬†and so much more are great¬†ways to integrate yourself in the community. Chances are, the other people there also are looking to make new connections.¬†

# Be kind¬†

Kindness goes a long way. Support your classmates, tell them what you liked about their project submission. Ask them for help with something you‚Äôre struggling with. When you‚Äôre open and understanding people will naturally gravitate toward you.¬†

# Assume you're already friends¬†

Lastly, but most importantly, treat people like you're already friends. People like being liked. If you're friendly, remember details they‚Äôve told you in the past and seem excited to talk to them, they will be more open to friendship. ¬†

We‚Äôre so excited for all the future friendships you‚Äôre about to make during your time in college! Good luck and have fun.¬†",1,1734706826.0,EssayHelpAndMore,0,1.0,False

Tolkien, Hobb, Abercrombie, and others","I have synesthesia and books often have a taste for me. Last year I did a [review of the taste on some of the books I read](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1baqj6l/a_synesthesia_book_taste_review/) and I thought it might be fun to do one for 2024 as well, especially because I read some popular books for the first time this year!

  
**The Hobbit - Taste Rating 5/5**

Mildly sweet

Corn and coffee. Imagine it‚Äôs the middle of the afternoon, time to eat a snack, and you get yourself a cup of coffee and some corn based pastry thing. In my country we have corn cake, corn bread, corn juice, corn ice cream, and The Hobbit made me crave them all. It‚Äôs mildly sweet, but not overpowering, just a nice cozy afternoon snack. I think this is the tastiest book I‚Äôve read this year and I want to re-read it just to taste it all over again.



**Assassin‚Äôs Apprentice - Taste Rating 2.5/5**

A comforting neutral

Assassin‚Äôs Apprentice tasted like a nice warm stew that you savor at the end of a long day. No fancy spices, just some potatoes, some carrots and warmth, which sometimes it‚Äôs all you need, you know? Think British food: a bit milder on the taste, but hearty and comforting, maybe even a bit of Shepherd‚Äôs Pie in there. I‚Äôm rating it in the middle because it‚Äôs one of those cases when something is just perfectly balanced it couldn‚Äôt be anywhere else but in the middle, but it was so comforting and I felt cradled by it.



**A Wizard of Earthsea - Taste Rating 4/5**

Cool and light

Ah, this one is hard to describe. It tasted like the color sea green. What does sea green taste like? Great question. Think a liquid that has a slightly thicker consistency, kind of like jelly before it solidifies, but cool and refreshing. Something you drink at your porch with a light summer‚Äôs breeze passing by. A lovely and peaceful taste.



**The City of Brass - Taste Rating 3/5**

Burning

You know when you burn your tongue eating something VERY hot? That was this book. I‚Äôd also say it tasted a little dusty, sandy perhaps, and like hot metal. But the majority of this book was just a burn in my tongue and the roof of my mouth. Still, it was an interesting taste that I hadn‚Äôt felt before, so I‚Äôm giving it some extra points for the novelty.



**The Blade Itself - Taste Rating 5/5**

A fun mix

Now this book was so interesting because it made me experience something unique, smell! I had never smelled words before, but this book did it for Jezal. Bergamots and hybiscus I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôd give 5/5 stars for that alone, but Abercrombie is so great at characterization each character had their own taste! That‚Äôs also something I hadn‚Äôt experiences before. Glokta is straight out iron with a hint of aluminum, if you lick a cast iron pan then a tin can, you got it. Logen tasted like wet rags and damp sticks, like try to chew on some damp piece of wood, that‚Äôs our guy.



Some honorable mentions:

**The Poppy War** 2/5 - I couldn‚Äôt taste it very well (probably because I listened to it instead of reading), so I could just taste something dusty, but more like dry dirt/soil.

**Blood Over Bright Haven** 3/5 - A bit tangy, a bit metallic, ozony (?), something along those lines. Don‚Äôt have much else to say.¬†

  
Those were the books that had the most noticeable tastes. Often times it's fairly mild and I have a hard time pointing out what exactly it is I'm tasting, so I don't always get a very distinct taste for books, my synesthesia isn't SUPER strong. It also depends on how immersed I get in the book, how the author sets the tone / vibes for the book, and whether I read or listen to the book. Words in my day to day life only occasionally have a taste, it's definitely more intense and frequent when I'm reading books.

","It was a regular Saturday night when I got a text from my ex saying, ""Baby, I miss you."" I shared the message with my girl best friend, and since we live in the university dorms, I made sure to lock the door. Ten minutes later, he knocks, so I get dressed and let him in. I was really confused and laughing at the situation. I asked him what was going on, and he said he was visiting friends in the dorm and couldn‚Äôt stand that the girl he loved was so close. We talked, and I made sure to set clear boundaries‚Äîno touching. It was nice catching up, and I did miss him deep down.

He said it was time to go and asked me if I wanted him to stay or leave. I told him it was up to him. He decided to leave, but then I teased him and asked, ‚ÄúDo you want to have sex?‚Äù He looked confused but answered ""Yeah"" and jumped back into bed. I pulled away, saying I couldn‚Äôt do it because I knew I‚Äôd regret it and it would ruin the progress I had made. He stayed in bed and started playing with my hair, and I started touching his arms, telling him he'd been working out a lot. Slowly, he started kissing my neck, and I enjoyed it.
Eventually, I came to my senses and pulled back, saying we couldn‚Äôt do this. He ignored me and went down on me. I couldn‚Äôt resist; it had been a while, and I gave in. Afterward, he asked me, ""Do you want it?"" and I said, ""Yeah,"" before he penetrated me. Suddenly, I realized how wrong everything felt and pulled away, sobbing. I told him, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He was confused, begging me to stop crying, but I told him to leave, so he did.
The next morning, someone knocked on my door, and there was breakfast and coffee left outside with no note. I asked my best friend to come over to talk about what happened, and we decided to leave the dorm to get some fresh air. On our way out, he saw us and came running after us, apologizing, saying, ""I‚Äôm so sorry for what happened yesterday. It wasn‚Äôt my intention, and I‚Äôm killing myself for it."" I told him to leave.
I‚Äôm so confused and need some advice on what to do or how to process all this. Can someone help?

I know I will feel better later but that feels like a long time from now. I shuffle out of my room and as I do, I let out a half assed.
‚ÄúMorning Chompy.‚Äù

I go to the kitchen and make an iced coffee. Before I take a sip, Aurora barges into the kitchen.
‚ÄúTwenty four hours is up. My eyes are no longer red.‚Äù

I change the subject.
‚ÄúSo how‚Äôs summer school coming along?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmazing.‚Äù Aurora answers.

‚ÄúHelen said it was fascinating to see witches from different parts of the world and no contact with each other come up with similar solutions.‚Äù

‚ÄúI agree. It‚Äôs wild to see similar problems get similar solutions no matter where in the world. Distance and time doesn‚Äôt matter. Many came up with similar spells. I‚Äôm taking the best I can find and putting them in my own grimore one day. I got big ideas.‚Äù

I start walking to the basement. As I do, I ask.

‚ÄúAbsolutely not. Now I‚Äôm more convinced that earth magic is the way to go. I haven‚Äôt even starched the surface.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool.‚Äù I say as I place my hand in the circle. It glows and the door opens. ‚ÄúHave fun.‚Äù I say.

Aurora walks into the vault and immediately sits down at the table.. I go back upstairs and to the patio. I light a blunt, take a hit and sigh. I sit down and sip my coffee in perfect peace until Maddy walks out.
‚ÄúThere you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù I say before taking a sip.

Maddy takes the blunt and then takes a hit.
‚ÄúNeed a favor.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù

‚ÄúI bet.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are split in half. One side thinks we should stick to the plan at all costs. The other side thinks moving now is a great disruptive move and it will speed things up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you feel about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want to do right by the town. This is all I‚Äôve ever cared about.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, mayor Madison. I believe you will do a great job.‚Äù

Maddy bows her head.
‚ÄúThanks, now I just got to ask Holden if he will come.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôll ask him. You got a debate to prepare for. I don‚Äôt even want you to answer your phone. Got me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

As she gets up, I say.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even worry about lunch. I got it.‚Äù

Maddy smiles and walks back into the house. I finish my blunt and coffee. Well, no time like to present. I get up and walk to the guesthouse and knock on the door. It‚Äôs opened by Fang.
‚ÄúI got to wake up Holden.‚Äù

Fang starts to get him but I stop Fang by putting a hand on his shoulder.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it. Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù

Fang looks at me.
‚ÄúI just want to say. It might have been scary yesterday but you were awesome. It cool to see how much you‚Äôve grown here.‚Äù

Fang smiles at me as I kiss the top of his head. I walk to Holden‚Äôs room. Since the door is open, I don‚Äôt knock. Inside is Holden and Lilith sleeping on the bed. Since yesterday, Lilith has watched him like a hawk and won‚Äôt let him out of her sight. It‚Äôs funny to see them have similar sleeping styles. Limbs akimbo wrapped up in the sheets. Without a care in the world. I walk over and shake Holden.
‚ÄúHey, dude. Wake up.‚Äù

Lilith opens her eyes and growls.
‚ÄúShit up, bitch. You know I‚Äôm not here to hurt your alpha. If I was waking you up. I‚Äôd understand.‚Äù

I shake Holden more.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Holden mumbles.

‚ÄúHey, Maddy has a debate tonight. She wants us there.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt. Washing my fur today. Very busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúCut the bullshit, Holden.‚Äù

Holden opens his eyes.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there. How you holding up?‚Äù

I crack my neck.
‚ÄúLittle stiff. I should be good to go later today. You?‚Äù

Holden grunts as he sits up.
‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, you look like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well. You‚Äôre ugly and eventually I‚Äôll heal.‚Äù

I smack Holden‚Äôs arm.
‚ÄúCan you wait a half hour before you start your bullshit?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the fun in that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are the only one having fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very much a you problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôm done. You want breakfast?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúYeah. My sidekick will need extra bacon for last night‚Äôs efforts.‚Äù Holden says as he pats Lilith‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúHelp me make it.‚Äù I say as I get up.

‚ÄúRight behind you.‚Äù

I walk to the kitchen and Holden joins me momentarily.

‚ÄúWhat do you think is on the hard drives?‚Äù I ask.

Holden stops what he is doing.
‚ÄúHard to say, no doubt what they were working on. What that is I can‚Äôt say.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you think of they did take kids. The location could be on them?‚Äù

‚ÄúPossibly. If any kids were taken at all. Maddy said it was werewolves and human. She didn‚Äôt say they were from our town.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think any kids were taken?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs entirely possible. I can only smell humans. Not the age they are. There were signs of people in there but nothing concrete.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to get into those hard drives.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWe do. Right now you need to flip those steaks.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù I say as I flip them over.

Suddenly there is a splash outside, followed by screaming. We run over and look out the window. Lilith, Fang and the gremlins are having a full on battle. Ninja is in a full karate stance. Gor is running around the pool while holding Fang high in the air. They are nowhere close but Gor throws him and Fang lands in the pool. At one point he had to be eight feet high. Lilith crawls out of the pool and faces Ninja. Tony runs up from behind and throws her back in.

‚ÄúWe need to stop this before it gets out of hand.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúNah, they are just playing.‚Äù Holden says as Ace dive bombs Fang.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre sure.‚Äù

Holden points out the window.
‚ÄúLook. They all are laughing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt look like playing.‚Äù I observe.

‚ÄúGuess werewolves and gremlins play rougher than humans.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess. Their soggy asses are eating outside, however.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough. Let‚Äôs finish cooking.‚Äù

We finish breakfast and bring the food out to the patio.
‚ÄúAlright you little monsters. Breakfast is ready.‚Äù I say as I hand Tony a pancake. Ace just swoops down and takes one off the plate. In shocking speed, all of the food is gone.

‚ÄúOk. Go play in traffic or something.‚Äù Holden says.

I‚Äôm a hurricane type of fury. Holden and I are left alone.

‚ÄúSo, we got some time. Want to take a ride? You‚Äôre the only one that hasn‚Äôt gone.‚Äù Holden asks.

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶I do.‚Äù I answer.

I pit the dishes in the dishwasher and join Holden outside.

‚ÄúThe only thing you need to remember is when I turn, lean into it. You won‚Äôt fall.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

Holden starts his bike and I get in and wrap my arms around his waist and we take off. We spend the next few hours riding. With a stop for an ice cream cone. As the world passes me by, I think. About everything. I did take some time to be in the moment and close my eyes and lay my head on Holden‚Äôs back. When we get back, Maddy is dressed to the nines and pacing around in the office.

‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúI think so. I‚Äôm a bit nervous.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. You‚Äôre going to fuck this dude up.‚Äù Holden tells her.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

I hold her face.
‚ÄúYou got this. Just remember, we will be in the crowd rooting for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI may start a wave.‚Äù Holden says.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

Holden chuckles as they hug.

‚ÄúOk. I got to go. Still coming?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúStop, worrying. We will be there.‚Äù I answer.

Maddy leaves and I turn to Holden.
‚ÄúWe should change into some nicer clothes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, Holden. You shouldn‚Äôt wear your cut. Politics is optics. How does it look to have a political candidate supported by an outlaw biker? You really want to fuck this up for her?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

We change into some slightly more grown up clothes and head out. The town hall was filled to the rafters. I happen to spy Tiffany in the crowd. Everyone settles down when the moderator walks out.
‚ÄúThank you for coming to this important mayoral debate tonight. I believe everyone knows who the candidates are. Hold any applause until the end. Thank you.‚Äù

Maddy and the mayor walk out and stand behind two lecterns. Each one makes an opening statement before questions. I thought Maddy‚Äôs was really strong.

‚ÄúThank you for your opening statements, candidates. Our first question tonight is about the economy. Our town has been in a depression for decades. How do you plan on reversing this downward trend. Mayor, you won the coin toss, so you get to answer first.‚Äù

The mayor straightens his tie.
‚ÄúI look to Steelglenn for the answer to this question. Over the years they have invested in infrastructure and tourism. They have made their downtown attractive for tourists and businesses. Our way forward is investing in our future.‚Äù

‚ÄúMadison. Your rebuttal.‚Äù The moderator says.

‚ÄúI believe we need to do more, we need to invest in our children‚Äôs education. Then they can come back with their degrees and help mold our towns future,‚Äù

‚ÄúThat will take too long. We need to do something now.‚Äù The mayor says.

‚ÄúThe right thing to do is rarely the easiest or fastest way of doing things.‚Äù Maddy replies.

‚ÄúMayor. You were not given time to respond to Madison‚Äôs statement.‚Äù The moderator says.

A man stands up.
‚ÄúFuck this. What about the darkness all around us? What are we going to do when we get attacked again? Fuck, I‚Äôm surprised a dragon hasn‚Äôt swooped down on us yet.‚Äù

Pandemonium breaks out in the town hall. The moderator tries to establish control but fails. During the chaos, a man in a black suit stands.
‚ÄúExcuse me.‚Äù

Nobody pays attention.
‚ÄúExcuse me.‚Äù

Ignored agin. He pulls out a gun and fires a couple of shots into the ceiling. After some screaming, the crowd falls into a stunned silence. The man puts his gun back into his jacket.
‚ÄúMuch better. Now listen‚Ä¶‚Äù
He walks out into the aisle and starts slowly walking.
‚ÄúMy name is‚Ä¶.well. You can call me agent Smith and I work for one of the three letter agencies.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù Someone from the crowd asks.

Agent Smith waves a finger.
‚ÄúOh. I know you don‚Äôt have the security clearance to ask that question.‚Äù

Agent Smith keeps walking.
‚ÄúNow, we‚Äôve heard some rumblings from this city. And I‚Äôve come to clear some things up.‚Äù

Agent Smith reaches the stage. He turns around and leans forward.
‚ÄúThe calvary is not coming‚Ä¶.ever.‚Äù

There is some confusion and gasps from the crowd.

‚ÄúThe U.S. government has wiped its hands clean of anything supernatural. For decades we tried to weaponize werewolves, vampires, ghosts, demons and full disclosure. That last one really went bad. We‚Äôve tried to weaponize everything that goes bump in the night. All have failed spectacularly. Loss of life, property damage etc. If I told you how much money we have wasted doing this. Well, you would choke on your own bile. If you believed me in the first place. Ironically we never messed with serial killers but they were the ones to break us.‚Äù

A man stands up.
‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be true.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs absolutely true. Let me ask you something.‚Äù Agent Smith says.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Answers the man.

‚ÄúHow many cites have had a nuclear bomb dropped in them?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWrong. No less than ten.‚Äù

The crowd becomes confused.

‚ÄúNever heard of this? Of course not. Uncle Sam has gone to extreme lengths to cover it up and make sure you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying the rest of the cities were American?‚Äù Maddy asks.

Agent Smith turns and looks at her.
‚ÄúYes. Yes I am. You‚Äôre a smart cookie. No wonder you‚Äôre running for mayor.‚Äù

Agent Smith turns back to the crowd.
‚ÄúThese cities have been wiped from history. Let‚Äôs just say, shit goes downhill and your fair little city gets overrun with‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶.goblins. We drop a nuke. Then we wipe any mention of this city off of the internet. We will kill any family and friends that don‚Äôt live inside the city so no one goes looking for a loved one or ask questions about a city that never existed. Doesn‚Äôt matter what site you use. Check the gps and all you will see is woods of a new park in the American parks division. Back in the analog days, this was a son of a bitch to do but it was more permanent if that makes any sense.‚Äù

Agent Smith puts his hands in his pockets and continues.

‚ÄúSpeaking of which. Go ahead and try to post of tweet anything spooky shit happening here. It will disappear instantly. Uncle Sam has its hands deep into the World Wide Web. We did help make it after all. Keep trying to post and you will go to the pit.‚Äù

Agent Smith looks at a young woman sitting next to him.
‚ÄúDo you know what the pit is?‚Äù

She shakes her head no.

‚ÄúIt is a facility‚Ä¶a prison actually. Serving only life sentences. No one ever gets out. It has no official name but it is very real and your rights stop at the front door. Let me tell you something. Some really nasty people and things are there and it‚Äôs located in your very state.‚Äù

Agent Smith looks around.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Let that sink in.‚Äù

Agent Smith now faces a man.
‚ÄúThe pit is very useful. Only the most dangerous things go in there. The average life expectancy for a normie like you is five minutes. I shit you not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in there?‚Äù Asks the man.

‚ÄúWell. I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs not in there. The god of serial killers. Yes, I mentioned them before but serial killers are real and I‚Äôm not talking about the random normal, human ones you see on crime tv. I‚Äôm talking about a sub species of humans and they have their own god. Years and years ago. A rouge agent tried to hunt him. It didn‚Äôt go well. It was this moment when the U.S. government doubled down on its supernatural stance. One man, went toe to toe with the government and we backed down. Ain‚Äôt that a bitch. Now listen to this. This will blow your fucking mind. This god has protected your city on more than one occasion. How her mom pulled that off I‚Äôll never know. Hey, look. It‚Äôs not all doom and gloom.‚Äù

Agent Smith points at me with one hand and Maddy with the other.
‚ÄúTheir moms created a network of like minded cities. To help each other fight this darkness. We don‚Äôt know why certain places draw the darkness and quite frankly no longer care. This network keeps all of your heads above water. While I‚Äôm on the subject, nobody in this network will ever receive medals or recognition for their work but thank you for your service.‚Äù

That last part he says while looking at me.

‚ÄúBut surly the government won‚Äôt let us fall.‚Äù A woman in the crowd says.

‚ÄúThe fuck we won‚Äôt. What part of the calvery is not coming did you not understand? Thankfully for you, her mom Faust has created alliances with the gargoyle kingdom, the fairy kingdom both have presences here. Yeah, there‚Äôs a reason this place is lousy with gargoyles and each one is real. Oh, this town also is buddy, buddy with leprechauns. And lastly with werewolves, sirens and vampires to a lesser degree.‚Äù

I stand.
‚ÄúHow do you know all of this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe watch. Very, very closely. How else will we know when to drop the nuke when all hope is lost? Full disclosure, there have been some close calls and her mom was the only thing standing between this city and the nuke. I mean‚Ä¶this city got attacked by some supernatural goddamn clowns for Christ sake. You all came really close when the sky turned red many years ago. It was touch and go for a few minutes.‚Äù

I am stunned at this admission.

The mayor leans forward.
‚ÄúFuck this. I‚Äôm out. I never signed up for any of this. I‚Äôm done. I will stay until the election but not a day longer.‚Äù

Agent Smith claps his hands once.
‚ÄúThe government doesn‚Äôt care. Remember, no posting to social media about any of this or it‚Äôs the pit for you. You will disappear without a trace. Look, this has been fun and illuminating but I got to go. Thanks for the taxes. Keep paying them. The IRS is scarier than anything that has come here‚Ä¶almost. Remember, the calvary will never come.‚Äù

We walks to the door and stops.
‚ÄúYou fucking creepy ass twilight zone of a city.‚Äù

All hell breaks loose and I get up and chase after agent Smith. I catch him outside.
‚ÄúAgent Smith.‚Äù I yell.

He turns around.
‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt know where your mom is. We stopped tracking her once she crossed state limits.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about that. Hold on.‚Äù

I take off running. I go to Jolene and grab the duffel bag. I bring it back and hand it over.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúHard drives from a subsidiary of Fresh Horizons. You no doubt know they been doing experiments on werewolves. There‚Äôs a possibility that they have started with humans also.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo? Not my problem,‚Äù

‚ÄúSee. It is. They may have kidnapped kids and moved them. Their locations may be in these hard drives. But they are encrypted.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuch a sad story.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you. Either take the hard drives and look into it or I tell my uncle. You know, uncle Helsing. You know who he is. You kinda hyped him up in your little speech back there. He despises children getting hurt. He will punish all those that hurt these children and the ones that didn‚Äôt help.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are blackmailing a federal agent.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am. No. I‚Äôm making a promise to you.‚Äù

To my surprise agent Smith smiles.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a promising young woman. There may be a place for you in my agency.‚Äù

He takes the duffel bag and walks away.",3,1734705905.0,MythosIndustries,2,1.0,False
1hil9co,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hil9co/favors_for_my_future_self_grouping_stuff_together/,Favors for my Future Self- Grouping Stuff Together,"Maybe there‚Äôs a term for this, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve started doing for myself that I‚Äôve found helpful in my day-to-day life.

Since learning that I‚Äôve always had an ADHD brain, I‚Äôve gained a lot of insight into why my own behavior was often so frustrating to me.

One issue in particular was frequently misplacing things I needed‚Äîmy wallet, keys, glasses, coffee, etc. The stuff I needed to leave the house became a huge point of stress, especially given how I experience time.

Something I‚Äôve started doing is this: as I walk through my house and notice an orphaned item (like ‚ÄúOh, there are my keys‚Äù), instead of just taking note of where they are (because it‚Äôs never in a designated spot, no matter how hard I try), I grab them and place them next to something else I‚Äôll need.

For example, as I‚Äôm getting ready in the morning, I might walk through the house, see my keys, and grab them and set them next to my coffee. A few minutes later, I might realize I‚Äôve left my glasses by the sink, so as I pass by again and add my glasses to the pile. Later, I might remember I need to bring something to work for a friend, so I‚Äôll put that near the other stuff too.

What ends up happening is that all my stuff gathers in one place without much effort. By the time I‚Äôm ready to leave, it‚Äôs all there, and I don‚Äôt have to rush around trying to find and remember everything.

It‚Äôs become a kind of fun game. I enjoy it, and it works as a little dopamine puzzle each day. I find myself doing it naturally now, without even thinking. My stuff becomes ‚Äústicky‚Äù and I want to stick them together.

Maybe others do this too, and maybe it has a name. I just call it ‚Äúgrouping.‚Äù I hope it can be helpful to some of you!",1,1734705789.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

# Why is SuperCMMS free?

SuperCMMS is developed by Digitised Energy (DE), a big data analytics firm for renewable energy. DE's big data analytics solutions generate lots of valuable insights about the functioning of Solar and Wind Assets. Very early on we recognised there was no easy way to assign, log, track, and work on these insights. So we built an internal tool to automatically ingest these insights and generate work orders. Slowly - with the addition of asset and inventory management capabilities - this internal tool morphed into a full fledged 'Computerised Maintenance Management System (CMMS)'.

Recognising the industry wide need for an easy to use CMMS, we spun out our internal CMMS module into a standalone product - SuperCMMS.

While core development is taken care of by DE, we intend to make SuperCMMS independent and financially sustainable. We achieve this by offering '[Enterprise Support](https://supercmms.com/enterprise)'.

A good CMMS keeps the factory, shop floor, building, coffee machine, water supply ... and the whole modern way of life up and running peacefully. We want SuperCMMS to do just that - without you having to worry about budgets.",1,1734705577.0,SuperCMMS,0,1.0,False

23M BCom grad from Chennai, currently pursuing articleship, registered articleship under scheme. In old scheme we had an option to register for articleship right after graduation without clearing FND & INT. 


Articleship duration is 3 years, within those 3 years you can prepare for inter & final and even clear it within this period. 

I‚Äôll be in my final year of articleship by this January, the past 2 years were terrible for me as I had to do lot of office work that includes maintaining office(bringing tea, coffee, snacks, water can etc) typical office boy. I‚Äôve appeared for inter g2 only once and failed terribly as I didn‚Äôt prepare very well. But I started my preparation like 3 months back. Currently I‚Äôve done 50% of audit, 50% of FSM, 30% of costing. I have very recently subscribed for G1 classes. 

I deliberately skipped the Jan attempt, I have this wild desire to get a rank, because the reward is huge and immediate. Having a rank in all levels is a key to enter into high profile careers.


Rankers of this subreddit, please help me out üôèüèΩ

Everyone is in their 20s ages ranging from 19 to 29. With about 6 or 7 ppl in the house. I say 6 or 7 bc one person has been staying the past couple days but im not even sure if hes officially a roommate or not? Its a pretty even mix of boys and girls too. Lol. But anyway, im pretty much completely white, and I noticed some weird things lately that im not sure if theyre due to cultural differences or age? For one, this i know is a cultural thing but also kind of grosses me out. I noticed the bathroom always had water on the floor and the toilet seat and even the counter, and never any toilet paper and i was like wtf is going on? Does someone not know how to shower? And i just assumed they were being cheap with the TP not wanting to share. Well it turns out, theyve been using the shower head as a bidet. Bc its attached to a hose. So they finally installed a real bidet thing thank god but im still kinda grossed out just knowing they were using the shower head i wash my body with AND. That they were leaving the water all over the place. Kind of inconsiderate if you ask me. Then theres the whole like not doing their dishes thing or cleaning the house but thats more due to age i think. But now i noticed theyre keeping certain foods outside the fridge that i would never, like eggs and milk? Coffee creamer? I even opened a cabinet and it had cut up onions in a bowl in it and bowls with oil in them, im like wtf? And inside the fridge isnt great either, leaving packages of raw chicken open without putting any kind of plastic wrap or putting it into bags, along with old leftovers and food that is definitely bad. Also theyre keeping canned goods in the fridge? Like veggies and condensed milk and coconut milk, like guys i think you got this backwards lol. The cow milk goes in the fridge and the coconut milk goes in the cabinet. They also leave their shoes outside their bedroom doors, which i understand no shoes in the house type thing but they just leave them hap hazardly strewn around the hall, to where im tripping on them. Kind of frustrating. Idk maybe its just a cultural thing but im having a tough time adjusting to this. Maybe someone can help me figure out how to talk to them? Thanks.  Sorry for the long post!

1hiky3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingSupportHub/comments/1hiky3f/10_tips_on_notetaking_during_lectures/,10 Tips on note-taking during lectures,"# You can‚Äôt write down every word

A lecture is not a dictation exercise where you have to write down everything the professor says. You need to watch out for key points, arguments and themes in the lectures.¬†

# Pay Attention

It's very easy to start daydreaming during lectures and miss an important point. Try to rest adequately before lectures so you don't doze off in class. Some take coffee before lectures to keep them alert, others chew gum. Listen attentively to examples given by the professor to explain a point. Sometimes the example helps us remember the point in future.

# Underline, Highlight and Capitalise

Lecturers often stress or draw attention to certain words or phrases. It is important to underline/highlight these words on your notepad to show how important they are. It might also be useful to start using these terms in your group discussions in order to get familiar with them.¬†

# Use Shorthand (Abbreviations)

In order to catch up, some words need to be written in short but in understandable forms. So, take some time to work out whatever shorthand code you're comfortable with. For example words like using ‚Äò2' instead of ‚Äòto', ‚Äòtoo' and ‚Äòtwo', or ‚Äòda' for ‚Äòthe'; ‚Äòw/' for ‚Äòwith', btw for ‚Äòbetween‚Äô, etc.¬†

# Put distractions away

It might be a good idea to turn off your Wifi during lectures to avoid receiving distracting messages on WhatsApp or Facebook. Don't forget to put your mobile phone on silent mode, and don't use headphones or earpieces!

# Be Comfortable

Ensure that you are punctual to your lectures and choose a convenient spot to sit. Students are often put off when their favourite corner of the lecture hall has already been taken. Choose a spot that makes you comfortable and feel part of the lecture. For me, I prefer the second or third row. I often find it difficult to concentrate at the backseats. They remind me of those noisy backbenchers in high school who chuckled and contrived pranks to be used on teachers and fellow students!

# Ask questions when confused

Don't just write down things you do not understand. Ask for clarification when you are confused. If you're not satisfied, you can always meet the lecturer for further clarification during breaks, after the lecture or during Office Hours.

# Share and compare notes with classmates

Two heads according to the popular adage are better than one. It is good to find time to compare notes with your classmates and use theirs to update yours and vice versa. They might have picked up some important points that you didn‚Äôt.

# Notepad versus Laptop

There has been a heated debate on which of these two is most effective for note-taking during lectures. Some argue that notepads are old-fashioned and others contend that laptops are distracting. For me, it depends on the individual. I started with notepads and ‚Äúmigrated‚Äù to my laptop. It depends on which you find more effective. However, I still use my notepad in some lectures. The point here is to use what works for you.

# Air your opinion

Lectures are not always one-sided. There are times lecturers throw questions to students or ask for reactions. Don‚Äôt be left out. Discuss how the subject matter relates to what you have heard or seen before and your personal opinion about it. The seminars and classes also give more room for personal reflection on the subject matter. They facilitate critical analysis and thrash matters arising from the lecture. Here you can even critique the lecture and offer you own argument. ‚ÄúA lecture‚Äù, as George Wald rightly points out, ‚Äúis much more of a dialogue than many of you probably realise‚Äù.",1,1734704891.0,WritingSupportHub,0,1.0,False

Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. And sorry for the long post. 
I am just here to rant about my life. 
I am (f) 40 years old married with two children. I love my kids but this year came to realize the mistake I made when I chose the wrong guy 14 years ago. 
So 14 years ago I was seeing a guy with whom I felt like In paradise. He was the whole package. Handsome, tall, blue eyes, brown hair, a swag, charming, all the things I liked in a man, also a law student. We met in a bar in our small town where everyone knew everyone. Not knowing me from before I was ‚Äúthe new girl ‚Äú for him, he noticed me in the crowd and approached me immediately. Even though I was attracted to him I knew of him and knew he had a girlfriend that was not from our town. That is why I told him not to loose time with me because I am not interested in destroying a relationship. He told me he broke up with his girlfriend a month ago, but of course I didn‚Äôt believe him. Every day for two weeks , everywhere I went he was there, ( remember small town with only 4 bars, 3 coffee shops and 2 clubs). He kept trying to convince me to go out with him. After two weeks I thought maybe he did broke up with his  girlfriend because he wasn‚Äôt hiding in flirting with me and was telling everyone he likes me. Asking my friends to convince me to go out with him, So I did üòÆ‚Äçüí®. We saw each other Every day for another month and it was amazing. Even though I felt wonderful with him in the back of my head I felt something wasn‚Äôt right. And I was right. One night we were going to just watch a movie and stay at his place. He went to take a shower and his phone rang. It was her. This was in a time of Nokia 3310 so no locked screens or phones. Then she sent a message and me being in a shock, opened the message which read: I will be joining you next Friday , found some friends that are coming down by car. Call me when you can. I was in disbelief. When he came out of the shower I confronted him and he told the truth. He didn‚Äôt brake up with her but fell for me hard and wanted to see if we will click. I said I was done and left. The whole week he was calling me and texting me begging me to forgive him and promising to break up with her if I did. I replied if you really wanted to be with me you would have broken up with her at some point the whole month he was with me. Few weeks later I met my husband and started dating him. Few weeks passed and the guy text me he broke up with his girlfriend and begged me to give him another chance. I felt it was too late and ignored him. For two months he kept texting and calling but I was hurt and I couldn‚Äôt forgive the lies. Finally he gave up. One year later me and my husband got married. I was in love and happy. Every now and then I was thinking of the guy thinking what could have been. Now 14 years later I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù and realized how much I disliked my husband and for this long I tolerated him. How could have I been so blind not seeing for what he is. Was I so hurt that I rushed in to a relationship with my husband just so I feel better. I am so confused and disappointed.  üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòî ",1,1734704728.0,u_Playful-Way9211,0,1.0,False

Yesterday the we had an issue with a delivery for a washer that is being warranty replaced due to some damage to our current one that keeps it from being able to stay stable when it spins. Long story short my H had to come home for a few hours during the work day to deal with the delivery people and the replacement was even more damaged than our  current machine so he refused delivery and had them move our current machine back in our laundry room. He worked late to make up the time and due to a deadline approaching. When he came home he asked for my help adjusting something on the garage door that he noticed, I helped him, he ate and then continued working in his home office while I watched TV. I made sure to state gratitude for him handing the washer situation. He was kind of going in and out of the kitchen and his office and talking to me when he did so and at one point said I should go to bed when I was ready since he was still working. Well I got ready for bed and got into bed maybe 3 minutes before my normal time. At which point he comes in and asks if I can hold the washer up so he can clean off the feet as he is afraid that they might come again tomorrow and scrape the floor up if there is any gravel on the bottom from when the workmen took it outside. I was already in bed and winding down so I used 'I can't'. He of course asked why not and I repeated I can't. Well he flew into a rage yelling that it was only 30 seconds and he cant ask for help from me ever and telling me F you over an over. I stated that I would help him tomorrow and DT for the rest. He grabbed all his sleep and stuff for the next day and went to sleep on the couch. After about 30 minutes I went out and said 'the dog and I miss you in here' but he just started the whole yelling about the washer again and then returned to the couch. 

Anyway I got up this morning when I woke up, I am usually a lay in bed for awhile person, with the intent to get ready and help him with the washer before work since he is so concerned about the possibility of another delivery today (even though I think this is highly unlikely) but he appears to have left for work early. He left all his sleep stuff on the couch, didn't take out the dog or make the coffee which are all things he does every morning. Fine I expected some of this as he has reacted similarly in the past. I called him once and he didn't answer. So I sent a text just saying I got up to help him and it looks like he went to work early and I hope he has a good day. No response. I go to pick up my glasses that were on the table next to the couch and he has smeared something all over the lenses. So petty and I am so hurt. I deserve this just because I didn't get out of bed to help him right then? I know I don't but it hurts that he thinks this is okay. I just set the glasses on his desk. 

Any advice would be welcome.",2,1734704668.0,surrendered_wife,0,1.0,False

not alot of extra weight. Could loose may be 8lbs over all.

Spent years weight training.

My family has a genetic disposition for high cholesterol. Even my tiny 95lb grandma had high cholesterol.  I am fairly active, don't eat much if any red meat most months.  When I do its one 1/4lb burger is that. I don't eat much processed food other than pretzels, a handful of chips maybe 2x a week (I have stopped since) Cheese is maybe once a week, coffee is black, drink 90-100+ oz water on average, and walk a decent amount but not as active as I was or could be.

I have sleep issues and have for many years so get between 4-7hrs most nights  but averaging more the middle of that. Now and again 2 nights of no sleep and need sleep aid to break the cycle. Over thinking and not shopping off the brain is usually the culprit.

Stress is a HUGE issue for me with an hour plus commute each way in traffic with terrible drivers and demanding work load  I always feel like Im burnt out. Slight inconveniences are more upsetting than they should be.

I am taking this head on with dietary changes to start, like higher fiber and leafy greens. The posts n here have been HIGELY helpful.

Setting up a higher daily steps goal and beginning  with 1 day a week resistance training to get back into it.

First  week in Jan  I have a doc apt to see if I can get imaging or any data to show arterial damage or blockage and will report back.

Seems like my biggest issues are stress and sleep.

Posting as a thank you  to everyone posting their stories. This will also serve as a way to post my initial findings and seeing if anyone else who's in decent shape with a small stature has similar stats.",2,1734704626.0,Cholesterol,4,1.0,False

We've been chatting for months, and last night, we finally met again. We went to a cafe, had tea, and talked about our interests. I noticed the way she looked at me, and I felt an attraction toward her too. After we finished, we decided to leave. Outside the cafe, she asked if I wanted to watch a Netflix movie with her, and I said yes. She invited me to her home, where I sat on the sofa while she brought some snacks. She asked which movie I wanted to watch, and I told her, 'Anything you like.' She smiled and played a horror movie, and we started watching it together.

1hikswf,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1hikswf/always_wanted_to_open_a_cafe/,Always wanted to open a cafe ,"For well over a decade now I've wanted to open a cafe, a standard authentic cafe that does basic coffee / espresso drinks and light food. The coffee won't be the best, but I want to make it as cheap as possible to purchase. Same for the very simple food offered. All the tables and chairs would be an amalgamation of purchases from random estate sales and thrift stores. I want to highlight local artists monthly on the walls. Would be nice to have a few tables out back in the patio too. If possible, having it open late until 1 or 2am would be preferred.

Other variations of this would be a coffee shop where there is a train that runs around the wall, perhaps a model train store on another level of the building. The big dream of this is to have trains deliver your coffee or food.

I would own the building, live upstairs. I always take notes of coffee shops I like across the globe, and my favorite ones are always the ones that have stood the test of time.

I can't pursue this dream anytime soon, it would probably fail or drive me into debt immediately / lose its glamor fast. I have a good stable job now. Maybe when I retire I can finally open the shop of my dreams.",52,1734704479.0,rs_x,20,0.99,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1hikrtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1hikrtt/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 20/12/2024**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1hikrf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hikrf6/aitah_for_going_no_contact_with_my_sister_for/,AITAH for going no contact with my sister for over a year?,"I (24F) have cut off contact with my sister (30F). It all started a year ago when my sister moved in with me. I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äî¬†*terrible idea*. Usually, this sort of thing ends badly, and, unfortunately, it did for us.

To give you some context... I grew up in a large family; I have seven sisters and one brother. We weren‚Äôt a big, happy family like you often see on TV. We all have the same parents, with a large age gap in the middle. The three eldest are closer in age, then there‚Äôs a nine-year gap, and the rest of us are closer in age ‚Äî we were always referred to as the ""four babies."" I‚Äôm the youngest, and there‚Äôs a 22-year age gap between me and my brother (the eldest). I actually quite like the older three, I think because we didn‚Äôt grow up together. (*You‚Äôll see why.*)

So, us ‚Äî the four babies ‚Äî grew up more as a unit. The oldest of the four babies was Kate (now 32), and she took on the role of mothering us younger ones, but it was very toxic. Looking back at my childhood memories, I‚Äôm appalled by what went on when our parents weren‚Äôt around. Due to this, I no longer speak to this sister. With her ""mothering,"" she got a kick out of having power and control over us, and there was a lot of physical & emotional abuse. I cut ties with her when I went to university. Finally free of her control, I could see clearly and be free from her abusive nature. When I was in the first year of university, I came to terms with all my past trauma ‚Äî it took a long time, but my boyfriend helped a lot, and I can now say I‚Äôve left the past behind me. This story is not about Kate, but as she affected me and others a lot, she‚Äôs still relevant to the story.

Now, to give context on the sister I‚Äôve recently cut off. In 2020, Amber (30F) was living in Australia with our eldest sister, Emily (41F). During this time, I was working at a place with very early starts, so I would be up at 4 or 5 am, which was the perfect time to call Amber in Australia because of the time difference. We grew quite close, and I really enjoyed finally having a connection with one of my siblings. As the youngest, I was always the butt of everyone‚Äôs jokes and pranks. It was something they all bonded over. I would say all of my sisters are quite loud, argumentative people, but for me, I hated conflict and confrontation, so I‚Äôm a massive introvert. I would mostly hide when trouble appeared.

Amber has always been the funny, cool, social butterfly sister. When I was little, I always looked up to her. She‚Äôs a bit ditsy but always meant well. Though she was younger than Kate, she was also under her control, so at times, Amber would be mean to me, too. Because we are five years apart, I was always a bit too young to ""join in"" ‚Äî or that‚Äôs what they‚Äôd say. By the time I was a teenager, I wouldn‚Äôt say we had much of a relationship, as she was never home from the age of 16.

At family gatherings, we were the classic family that acted ""nice"" to each other, but it was all surface-level. This used to make me really sad as a child, because I knew it wasn‚Äôt something I could change. The norm of how everyone spoke to each other had already been set by the time I was born, and I was mostly ignored when I spoke anyway.

So, when Amber and I started to connect online during Covid, it was actually really nice. We spoke really openly about our feelings and day-to-day lives. We learned about each other now as adults, and we also spoke about our own experiences of childhood. When I told her how I felt growing up, she did apologise for joining in. It was nice to hear, and I finally felt heard.

I would say Amber had her own rocky path (drugs, alcohol, hanging around the wrong crowds), and when I was getting to know her again through our phone calls, I came to learn that she wasn‚Äôt the confident social butterfly we knew her as when we were kids. She had so much anxiety now and would have a lot of panic attacks.

She told me about how unhappy she was living in Australia with our other sister Emily (41F). Emily married an Aussie, they have three small kids, and she works full-time. She‚Äôs always been very independent and a bit of a hothead (I‚Äôve never seen it personally, but I‚Äôve heard stories if she‚Äôs pushed). So, I‚Äôd say the two of them living together was troublesome because Emily already had a lot on her plate with her family, and Amber, not being emotionally stable and a bit ditsy, was not a good match.

Amber stressed to me that she felt trapped. She knew she had to move out but couldn‚Äôt afford a place of her own in Australia. She really wanted to move back to our home country but didn‚Äôt want to move home. Our dad passed away in 2021, and that left a stain on our family house, as well as Kate still living nearby. (I don‚Äôt want to give more information on Kate than I need to, but as she affects both Amber and me, more details are needed to help you fully understand. During this point, Kate was having a mental health episode, spiralling from Dad‚Äôs death, calling people at all hours of the night, drinking too much, with ambulances and the police being called several times. Bless our mum, she was really stretched at this time, so Amber didn‚Äôt want to add to that either.)

At this point, I was living in a city a few hours away from my hometown with my boyfriend. We‚Äôre both very laid-back people, and our life was quite comfortable. It came up that Amber could move in with us. It was actually my boyfriend‚Äôs idea. He said, ""Amber‚Äôs the only sister I like of yours; she‚Äôd always be welcome."" This made me really happy to hear, and I liked the idea of helping her, being recognised as someone who could help rather than the baby sister that gets ignored.

We were moving house anyway to a bigger space, so it felt ideal: cheaper rent, helping Amber out, and we could build on our relationship and get to know each other better.

I realise this story is already really long, but there‚Äôs so much context to add to give you a full picture of the family dynamic.

So, jump to when Amber moved in with me (24f) and my boyfriend Dan (26M) of six years. By this point, we had already moved into the new house about 3 or 4 months before Amber arrived. Things were starting to look homely, but housing d√©cor and appliances are expensive, so we were still working on getting a few more items. I did mention to Amber that we were missing things like a dining table and some kitchen equipment. She said no problem, she would love to help and was excited to move in and create a home with us. Amber mentioned that she‚Äôd never ""built"" a house; she had only sofa-surfed, house-shared, stayed in hotels while travelling (she‚Äôs travelled a lot), or rented fully furnished places. Whereas I am the opposite ‚Äî since university, I‚Äôve paid for all my own living costs. I met my boyfriend in my first year, and we moved in together when I was in my third year of uni. Over the years, we‚Äôve been able to build and upgrade all household items as the years went on. Neither Dan nor I came from money and have always been financially independent. (This will all become relevant.)

When Amber moved in, I was working on launching my own business, working part-time, and spending the other half of my time building my business. The first few months were good. We gave her a large-sized room, bigger than any room we had growing up, and we also furnished the room with a bed and side table, so she would only need to get a wardrobe or any other d√©cor items. As we all wanted to save money, we initially agreed on doing a food shop together and cooking meals together (I‚Äôm blessed with a boyfriend who can cook, so Dan was happy to do this for everyone). However, we soon learnt that Amber didn‚Äôt like eating anything that we ate, which wasn‚Äôt a problem, so we moved to sorting out our own food.

As time went on, Amber opened up more and more about her mental well-being, which I was happy to be a pair of ears to listen. From my own experience, I know how valuable it is to have a friend who listens rather than interrupts and dismisses your problems. This was pretty much how things went when we‚Äôd call each other when she was living in Australia. She would call me up crying about X, Y, and Z that just went down, and I would listen and offer advice or opinions here and there, but mostly listen.

However, receiving this daily/weekly in person was quite a lot for me to deal with. I would start my day and find Amber crying to me. I was feeling very stressed with my ownwork, social life, and my battled emotions from losing my dad, so Amber‚Äôs problems on top started to take a toll on my mental health.

What added to this was that I kept catching her in a lie. She would tell my boyfriend stories about when she was younger, and 90% of them were false! The worst thing is that Dan could call her bluff, too. Dan and I don‚Äôt hide anything from each other; He knows pretty much everything about me, including the dramas from my childhood. Although the living dynamic at home was toxic, we didn‚Äôt grow up ""rough."" We are a middle-class family, and we grew up in a very sheltered, middle-class town. We were, of course, a big family, so we didn‚Äôt have lots of money to go on yearly holidays or buy the latest gadgets, but we did grow up in a nice, big house. We all had our own bedroom and a big garden. So, when I heard that Amber had been telling Dan that we grew up poor, I was shocked and confused. What‚Äôs insulting is that Dan actually did grow up poor ‚Äî he was raised by a single mum who worked four jobs to house and feed him and his siblings. I have so much respect for his mum for how she raised him.

Another example of her lying is when she said that, as a child, she had lots of tests done on her ears to check if she was deaf. The reason this came up is that, on several occasions, when we were just pottering around the house, she would ignore me, and I got fed up. I confronted her (which is not like me at all, but after it happening a few times, I spoke to Dan about it, and he said I should ask her why). She told me she didn‚Äôt hear me because ""don‚Äôt you remember when I was eight, and Mum kept taking me out of school to get my ears checked? I think I‚Äôm part deaf.""

This really confused me because I have no memory of this at all. So, I called my mum the next day and asked her. She said that never happened. When I told Dan this, it made him really angry because he was actually born deaf. He had grommets put in his ears when he was four, so he struggled with communication when he was young ‚Äî you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell now, though, as he‚Äôs a confident, charismatic person.

There were a few more lies that I picked up on, but those are the ones that come to mind as I‚Äôm writing this. Her behaviour started to annoy me, and it seemed like she wanted everyone to pity her because of the ""cruel hand of life"" she felt she had been dealt. I found this hard, as I had dealt with a lot when I was younger, but I guess maybe, as I‚Äôve accepted and come to terms with my own pain, this is just her way of expressing her upset?

Because of that, I took her behaviour with a pinch of salt. I kept thinking,¬†*‚ÄòWe‚Äôve given Amber this space so she can be in a calm environment and heal her demons in her own way, just like I kind of did when I went to uni.‚Äô*

But things got worse. She started complaining daily that the house wasn‚Äôt great. Her room was too small (which it isn‚Äôt), so she had to leave her stuff all over the rest of the house. I barely spent any time at home, and neither did Dan. We both worked every day and were only home to shower or sleep, but we did really try to work on making the house feel like a home. So, when she complained, it really upset me. It felt like she was treating me like I was ""Mum,"" who should fix everything. This felt very strange and stressful to my already full plate. Amber didn‚Äôt have a job ‚Äî she did yoga and had plans to teach. She also did OnlyFans (which never bothered me; each to their own). So, she would be at home all day, ‚Äòplanning‚Äô her lessons and business ideas.

Something else I want to mention is her identity. I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone with this part, and I don‚Äôt know much about ADHD and bipolar disorder, so please forgive me if I say anything incorrect (and feel free to correct me in the comments; I‚Äôd really appreciate learning more to fill in the gaps of my knowledge).

I believe Amber got stuck in the mindset that ‚Äúsomething is wrong with her.‚Äù She would watch a lot of videos online ‚Äî ADHD, bipolar disorder, and autism TikTok videos. She‚Äôd send me videos with titles like ""Why you should be fragile to your adhd or autisum friend..."" It was as though she was sending me a reminder or giving an excuse before something happened. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe this was her way of trying to educate me. But it was hard, because every month she would self-diagnose herself with something new. In my opinion, I felt sorry for her, as it mustn‚Äôt be a nice feeling to think something is wrong with you. But what became frustrating was that she would use these ‚Äúself-diagnoses‚Äù as excuses for not doing things.

This continued for about a year and a half. Tensions got high at times, but because conflict scares me (due to trauma from childhood), I would always have calm conversations with her to talk things through. After that, we‚Äôd be on good terms, and then the cycle would start again.

But things started to get worse. It‚Äôs now 2023, and energy bills across the country are ridiculous. I heard from a lot of people who would normally leave their heating on low all year round, and they ended up with thousands of pounds in bills over the winter. We also received a big bill, but we kept an eye on it. Dan and I weren‚Äôt at home much, so we barely used any energy. We asked Amber to be mindful of her usage and kept reminding her that we couldn‚Äôt afford a huge bill.

This is what leads to the big fight. She wasn‚Äôt being very tidy around the house either. Dan and I would come home late from work to find the house messy, but we‚Äôd be too tired to say anything and would just go to bed. However, one night, we came home, and Dan found Amber in the living room, making a video in lingerie (not doing anything explicit), but she had about three massive ring lights on. All her laptops, iPads, and cameras were plugged in, and she had the heating on full with the window wide open. The logic behind having the heating on full and the window open baffled me, but when Dan saw this, he was furious.

Dan is a lot more blunt than I am. A spade is a spade in his eyes. Every time I told him how Amber had upset or annoyed me, he would say that she was ""using us"" or something along those lines. He wanted to speak to her, but I always asked him not to, as I knew how fragile she was. He‚Äôs also more of a hothead than I am. He can get angry quickly, but it‚Äôs usually directed at inanimate objects ‚Äî like when a TV stops working or something, and he ends up shouting at it. It‚Äôs always for something trivial, which is actually kind of funny to see. When he was a kid, he used to be very angry a lot (which stems from his own childhood experiences of being deaf, etc.), but it‚Äôs something he‚Äôs worked on and gained control over. Throughout the time we‚Äôve been together, I‚Äôve never seen him be aggressive, though I‚Äôve heard stories about how he used to get into fights at school.

So, when Dan saw Amber, as he put it, ‚Äútaking the piss‚Äù by using all the electricity in the living room, and then finding the kitchen and hallway messy with her laundry and dirty dishes, he flipped.

He came to me first, told me how annoyed he was. I was equally angry when I found out. I was so confused as to why she would be using all the electricity and heating with the window open. He was right ‚Äî she was ""taking the piss,"" or perhaps you could see it as her being ditsy and not thinking. When Dan and I were talking about it, Amber called out to say she was going to the shop and asked if we wanted anything. We both said no, and she left. Dan then said, ‚ÄúFine, if I can‚Äôt talk to her now, I‚Äôm putting her laundry in her room. It‚Äôs been there for three days.‚Äù So, he took the clothes from the drying rack and put them in her bedroom. We went upstairs to our room, and about 10 minutes later, Amber called out, ‚ÄúWhy the hell has this been put in my room?‚Äù

I could feel the animosity building, and my stomach turned with anxiety. Dan came down the stairs and explained his reasons, in his blunt way, of course, not trying to tiptoe around any sensitive areas that might upset her.

She bit back, shaking with anger. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the right to touch my stuff! How dare you?‚Äù They both started shouting. I tried to intervene, occasionally saying that Dan had a point, and then questioning why the window was open with the heating on. I was very aware that this could feel like we were ganging up on her, so I wanted to approach it in the right way. But whenever I said something that Dan agreed with, he would chime in again, talking over me.

Amber said she didn‚Äôt have a reason for what happened, then whined that she was so upset about having to raise her voice. ‚ÄúDan, you‚Äôre making me feel like when I was a kid!‚Äù (This was definitely her attempt at guilt-tripping.) She continued, ‚ÄúSince I was a kid, I‚Äôve never shouted, and now I‚Äôm shouting and I‚Äôm upset. How dare you?‚Äù ‚Äî and so on. This was another lie, as I had heard about the constant shouting matches when Amber was living with Emily.

They both were shouting at each other (I want to note here that this had never happened before). At that point, I told myself I had to step in (I hated this part). I shouted, and it seemed to scare both of them. They both looked shocked ‚Äî Dan had never seen or heard me shout.

I pointed at them and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so disappointed in both of you!‚Äù I turned to Amber and told her that how she was treating the house was unfair, and that I couldn‚Äôt carry the weight of her problems anymore. I then turned to Dan and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so disappointed that you talked over me.‚Äù He tried to interrupt, but I continued, ‚ÄúLeave this to me. You‚Äôve said what‚Äôs on your mind.‚Äù This was so painful for me to say to Dan, and I know and understand why he was frustrated, but I couldn‚Äôt let Amber think I was behind how the situation was being handled. I also wanted to soften the impact for her, so it didn‚Äôt seem like all the blame was on her.

I told Dan to go upstairs and that I‚Äôd talk to him in a bit. I spoke to Amber for a few more minutes and eventually got her to calm down. Then, I called it a night.

I was shaking. I went upstairs to find Dan looking very sheepish. He apologised straight away, and I just cried. We spoke for a few hours, going over how he felt, how I felt, and that Amber was my family ‚Äî so if I told him to leave it to me, he needed to listen. He apologised again, and I apologised for having such a difficult family. Then, we went to bed.

After that, Dan and I agreed that Amber needed to move out. It wasn‚Äôt working. We had given it a try, but it was now affecting our relationship. We never argue, so this was very upsetting. He asked me to speak to Amber and ask her to move out. We weren‚Äôt going to rush her, but we agreed it couldn‚Äôt go on for another year.

I spoke to her the next day. She was upset and said that she was annoyed with me for not spending time with her outside the house, and apparently, I was giving off ‚Äúmain character energy.‚Äù I found this offensive to hear, because yes, I had been busy, but it wasn‚Äôt like I was doing selfish things. All I do is work. I had invited her out with my friends, but she said she felt socially awkward and had panic attacks when we hung out. It felt like she was finding things to blame me for. Maybe I am at fault for not spending more quality time with her, but I found that every time we did have a coffee date or whatever, it would turn negative and end with her crying about her life. So, I found myself avoiding her.

I apologised to Amber because I did feel bad if she felt lonely, but I stressed that I didn‚Äôt know what else I could do to help. She said she didn‚Äôt need my help. I then asked her if she would find somewhere else to live, as I didn‚Äôt see this resolving. I felt that we needed space so we could rebuild our relationship. She was sad, but agreed. This was around April when the fight happened.

A few months went by, and things were civil. I won‚Äôt lie, I distracted myself with work. I worked so hard on not being sad anymore, I didn‚Äôt want to think about this situation any longer.

Then, she told me she was still mad at Dan. She wouldn‚Äôt speak to him personally but kept using me as a messenger, which got draining. The thing is, Dan had actually apologised to her the day after the fight, saying that he was sorry for raising his voice and that he never wanted the argument to escalate ‚Äî . She nodded but didn‚Äôt say anything. So, when she told me she was still mad at him, I asked, ‚ÄúWhat else can he do to make it up to you? You haven‚Äôt apologised to him.‚Äù She said she didn‚Äôt think she needed to. That annoyed me, but I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to push further, so I dropped it.

About five months went by, and we didn‚Äôt see much of each other. Amber was dating a guy and had made a new friend, which I was happy to hear about. I didn‚Äôt like to think of her feeling lonely. One day, I asked if she had any plans to move, and she told me she was going back to Australia but wanted to leave all her stuff here.

I asked her, ‚ÄúWill you still be paying rent?‚Äù and she replied that she hoped not. I explained that Dan and I were tight on money, so if she moved out, we‚Äôd need to get a new lodger. This really stressed her out. She started crying, saying how hard and stressful it would be to move all her belongings (she had¬†*a lot*¬†of stuff ‚Äî Amazon parcels arrived weekly). I calmed her down, apologised, and explained that Dan and I were saving money for our business. At this point, I had left my part-time job to work on my business full-time. It was going quite well, and I don‚Äôt know if that ever played a part in her bitterness, that her little sister was also doing well, climbing the career ladder. I didn‚Äôt like thinking about that, and I pushed it to the side. But when I‚Äôd tell my friends about the situation, or Dan, they‚Äôd often mention jealousy.

Amber agreed to find a storage company for her things, and the conversation ended there.

It‚Äôs now October, and Dan and I‚Äôs birthdays are only a week apart, making it a very busy month for us. I didn‚Äôt see Amber much during this time, but she briefly mentioned that she was planning to go to Australia soon, and I was happy for her because she seemed excited. But then came the next big fight.

She later said she had told me when her flight was, but I didn‚Äôt remember the conversation. To be honest, my headspace was probably elsewhere because I had been very busy and stressed with work. It was Dan‚Äôs birthday, and we woke up to a message from Amber saying she had gone to the airport.

I was floored. I rushed downstairs to find all of her things still in her bedroom, and I was furious. All the voices from my friends telling me that she was using me rushed back into my mind. I was so upset. I called her and told her that I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay rent without getting another lodger. I felt completely betrayed that she would just leave without notice, leaving all her belongings for me to sort out.

I called her straight away. I won‚Äôt lie ‚Äî I was extremely angry, so I didn‚Äôt hold back. I asked her why she did this and what she expected me to do. She said that she thought everything was okay and didn‚Äôt see what the problem was. She stayed calm the whole time on the phone while I was raging. It felt belittling and passive-aggressive the way she spoke to me, as if I was the crazy person making all this up. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, OP? We agreed on this, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt blame her for what happened next, as airports are stressful, but she told me she had to go and hung up.

I immediately called my mum, crying, asking if she knew anything about this. I honestly just needed to talk to someone who wasn‚Äôt Dan because, of course, he was as angry as I was, and I wanted a different perspective.

My mum said she knew Amber was going to Australia but wasn‚Äôt sure of the exact day and didn‚Äôt know anything about Amber needing to move her stuff out. While I was on the phone with my mum, Dan was texting Amber. True to his blunt nature, Dan sent a message saying, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have someone to sort out your belongings, I‚Äôm going to sell all of it.‚Äù

I then get a call from Amber while I‚Äôm still on the phone with my mum. She‚Äôs crying, saying, ‚ÄúOP, you can‚Äôt sell my stuff, that‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù I ask her what she means, and she tells me that Dan texted her saying we would sell her belongings. I look at Dan with annoyance, but because I know him, it also made me giggle a little. I told Amber, of course, we wouldn‚Äôt sell her stuff, but we would have to do something. I asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you expect us to do?‚Äù She then starts crying even harder, saying she feels trapped because she‚Äôs at the airport and we‚Äôre being mean by bombarding her. I said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs mean is that today is Dan‚Äôs birthday, and you decided to do this to us.‚Äù

Something I didn‚Äôt mention earlier is that about a week prior, I‚Äôd spoken to Amber about how the electricity bill had gone through the roof. We had caught her a few more times leaving all the heating on and appliances running with windows open, so I had told her that the rent would be going up the next month because of the huge bill. After finishing the call with Amber, it dawned on me that she hadn‚Äôt paid the electricity bill, and we definitely didn‚Äôt have the money to cover it. That feeling hit me like a gut punch.

As I was talking to my mum, I found out that Amber was planning to surprise Emily in Australia. Emily had no idea Amber was on her way to meet her. I stayed in close contact with Emily, though with the time difference, we didn‚Äôt speak every day, but it was still frequent. Emily told me that things weren‚Äôt great between her and Amber, still. That‚Äôs when my mind immediately went to Emily. I wanted to talk to someone who understood where I was coming from, and at this point, I just started bawling. I was crying so much. It was still early in the morning, so I called Emily since it was a decent time for her.

She picked up, and of course, she was upset to hear how upset I was. She talked me through everything. She was shocked to find out that Amber was on her way to surprise her. Emily said, ‚ÄúGosh, I hope she doesn‚Äôt expect to move in with me.‚Äù Finally, I understood exactly where Emily was coming from. When Amber and I got close during Covid, we‚Äôd talk on the phone every day, and she would cry about how evil Emily was and how she was a bad person for not helping her out. That‚Äôs when it clicked. Emily told me about a fight¬†¬†her husband had with Amber, and it was practically the same argument she and Dan had. I honestly felt like I‚Äôd been played.

I told Emily that I was worried financially since Amber had left so abruptly. To my surprise, Emily actually offered to help. She sent me some money to cover the costs, which I later paid back. My family doesn‚Äôt usually give out handouts, so I was really shocked to receive this, and I‚Äôm incredibly grateful.

All of this happened within an hour after we woke up. After that call with Emily, Dan and I tried to forget about the chaos and actually enjoy the rest of his birthday. I felt so bad for him. I kept thinking,¬†\*Why do I have such an awful family?\*There‚Äôs a reason I moved so far away from them, and I really wish I‚Äôd never invited Amber to stay with us. I think I still had hope that maybe we could rebuild our friendship, but maybe I was too naive.

I went no contact with Amber after that because it was now my birthday, and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with all that family drama. It was my 25th, and Dan had arranged a surprise party for me at my favorite jazz bar in a neighboring city. All my friends were there, even some who had traveled up from my hometown. It made me feel so thankful ‚Äî we really do choose our own family, don‚Äôt we? :)

Around this time, I also had a major deadline at work. One evening, I was working late, and I really didn‚Äôt take care of myself that day. I was starving and exhausted but needed to keep going. At 8 p.m., I get a call from my other sister, Beth (27). Beth is the second youngest, so she‚Äôs younger than Amber, and she‚Äôs part of our ‚Äúfour babies‚Äù.

Beth called me to discuss the trip that she and Mum were planning to make to visit me for my birthday. But then, it became clear that she was really calling on Amber‚Äôs behalf. She told me that she and Mum were coming up to pack up all of Amber‚Äôs things, and that they had hired a man with a van to take everything to a storage facility. I was furious ‚Äî I thought,¬†*How rude and selfish of Amber to put all this work on Beth and Mum.*¬†They were supposed to be coming to visit me and celebrate my birthday, not act as movers.

I could tell from Beth‚Äôs tone that she wasn‚Äôt on my side. She said she was very angry and disappointed with me and Dan for how we had treated Amber. I‚Äôm sure Amber had been crying to Beth, telling her that we were ‚Äúevil,‚Äù just like she did with Emily during Covid when she would call me to complain.

Then Beth went on to say she was worried for my wellbeing. I was confused and asked her what she meant. She said Amber had told her that Dan was controlling and abusive, and that Amber was concerned I was in danger of being in a domestic abusive relationship.

I was completely taken aback. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. As Beth continued, it seemed like she was portraying Dan as the puppet master behind why we ‚Äúkicked Amber out‚Äù and why I had fallen out with her. She placed all the blame on Dan.

I know I‚Äôve mentioned that Dan has a history of being aggressive in his teenage years, but those were just schoolyard fights, not anything remotely related to domestic violence. Not once has he ever been aggressive toward me or anyone I know. Listening to Beth talk like this was insulting. Since I left home, Dan has been my rock ‚Äî he supported me through the emotional pain of my childhood trauma and stood by me when my dad passed away. I was so depressed, and he helped me through it all. On the other hand, my family had caused me pain in the past, and now they were attacking the one person who had shown me true kindness.

I told Beth that she was talking nonsense and that her view of the situation was completely wrong. I was already emotionally drained and still working as I spoke to her, so hearing all of this ‚Äî being told I was in an abusive relationship, and that Mum and Beth weren‚Äôt coming to celebrate my birthday but to move Amber‚Äôs things ‚Äî pushed me to my breaking point. I just started crying.

I told Beth everything I was feeling, and she apologised for catching me at a bad time, saying she‚Äôd talk to me more when she saw me.

If you‚Äôre still reading, thank you for sticking with me. I‚Äôm almost at the end of the story. To summarise what happened when Beth and Mum came to visit: they moved Amber‚Äôs stuff out (I was working and, to be honest, didn‚Äôt want to get involved). Afterward, we went out for dinner and drinks.

A quick note about Beth: she‚Äôs always been the ‚Äúprincess‚Äù of the family, the drama queen. This isn‚Äôt meant as an insult; she knew it and loved it. So, even though it was my birthday, we ended up going to the restaurant she wanted to go to.

As for Mum, well, she‚Äôs always been a bit of a pushover. She‚Äôs kind-hearted, and since I have older siblings, my parents are getting on in age, so Mum doesn‚Äôt like to get involved in family drama. She‚Äôs always said that we should sort out our own arguments. That probably explains why my sister Kate ‚Äî the ‚Äúevil‚Äù one ‚Äî was able to boss us around.

Anyway, at dinner, we ended up drinking, and the conversation inevitably turned to the Amber situation. Beth and I had a huge argument, and I ended up crying at the restaurant. I was embarrassed, but also just¬†*done*. Beth said she had ‚Äúdifferent morals to Dan and I ‚Äù and would never treat a family member the way we had treated Amber. I told her I didn‚Äôt really have a choice in the matter. We somewhat patched things up before heading home, but the argument left a stain on the rest of their visit. We didn‚Äôt talk about it again because we just couldn‚Äôt see eye to eye.

As for Dan, I felt bad for him. He tried to stay out of the way to avoid upsetting anyone, and he personally apologised to my mum, which she accepted. I think Mum tried to see both sides of the situation and didn‚Äôt want to take anyone‚Äôs side.¬†

Since all of this, Amber has tried reaching out a few times, but never apologising. She just says, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs let bygones be bygones. We‚Äôre family, so we should put this in the past.‚Äù And for me, that‚Äôs not good enough. I see so clearly now that she‚Äôs never taken any accountability for her actions, and if she doesn‚Äôt, she won‚Äôt learn. She‚Äôll just do it again, and I don‚Äôt want to see it or let it happen again to me. I feel like I‚Äôm being selfish for not forgiving her, but she‚Äôs hurt me so much.

I‚Äôve joked that I have a big enough family that I can lose one more sister, but in all seriousness, I‚Äôm not bitter towards her. If there was a family event, I would be civil but not her friend. For me, I think that‚Äôs all I can do.

It‚Äôs coming up to Christmas now, and I‚Äôve chosen to stay in the city I live in and celebrate Christmas with Dan‚Äôs family. Me and Beth have patched things up, and I‚Äôm really close with my mum ‚Äî we still talk pretty much every day.

I‚Äôve had updates from my mum that Amber left Australia a earlier this year, lived with my mum (rent-free for months), but now apparently she‚Äôs doing really well living in a flat of her own. This makes me happy to hear, as I know this is the first time she‚Äôs owned a flat. I hope she‚Äôll understand and learn the pressures of living costs.

Anyhow, I still feel like an arsehole for having no contact with her, so I‚Äôm asking all of you Redditors: AITAH for going no contact with my sister for over a year?

I understand that there‚Äôs always another side to every story. This is mine; please feel free to be brutally honest. I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm being too harsh and maybe I should give her a second chance, as we are family after all.

Thanks to everyone for reading. I hope your families aren‚Äôt as complicated as mine.

All the best,  
OP.

  
edit- I understand this is very long to read but I wasn‚Äôt sure how to make it any shorter. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this. to be frank , even just writting all of this down for myself has been really nice, feels like a weight has lifted. Ive reminded myself what went down, i started to forget some of the details when i was feeling guilty for still not talking to her. but as I started to write this it just all flowed.  

  
thank you to those that have taken the time to even just read the tiniest amount of my story. All comments are deeply appreciated.

1hikqk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hikqk3/im_tired_of_being_painted_as_the_problem_in_a/,I‚Äôm tired of being painted as the problem in a mess I didn‚Äôt create. ,"I was raised by a single mother. My father was absent. When he was around, I have vivid memories of his abuse (trying to push my mom down stairs, him pulling his pants down in front of me, him making disgusting comments about my body and my ‚Äúbig titties‚Äù at 15, etc.) so he wasn‚Äôt great. 

Growing up, my mom was an alcoholic. She was highly functional though, and I always had a warm meal, clean clothes, and a place to stay. She worked really hard, and I acknowledge all of her sacrifices and work to pour into me. But she was an alcoholic. We used to watch the show intervention together sometimes growing up, and she would always say ‚Äúsee i‚Äôm not as bad as them.‚Äù When she drank she would smoke cigarettes, and I always told her that was unhealthy (thanks D.A.R.E.), and she always said ‚Äúyour grandmother smokes multiple packs a day, I‚Äôm not that bad.‚Äù As a kid and growing up, I always rationalized her behavior because I was shown examples of it being worse. I never realized how much of a toll her behavior had on me. 

I used to see her passed out on the couch, and check on her every few hours to make sure she was still breathing. She had locked herself in the bathroom on a few occasions in her drunken state, which, as a 7 year old is fear inducing. I didn‚Äôt know if she was dead or alive in there. Family get togethers, mom would always end up drinking too much. I would be trapped wherever we were. It always felt awful. When I became a young teen, she started hanging out with her cousin and be gone all night. I would have to call her 20, 30, 40 times in succession just to get her to answer and hear her voice so I knew she wasn‚Äôt dead. She used to drunken drive a LOT with me. And there was always a difference in the mom I got when she was sober versus the mom I got when she was drunk. Sober? Normal. Drunk? maybe she‚Äôs overly loving to the point where it was weird (not incest weird but like ‚Äúwhy do you want to pretend ballroom dance with me in the middle of the living room‚Äù weird), or she would get aggressive and want to hit me but be so drunk and uncoordinated that nothing hurt/struck me for real. 

When I was younger, I used to stay in my room. It was my safe haven. It was where I could go and be unapologetically myself. Where I was safe. Where I didn‚Äôt have to smell stale alcohol on anyone‚Äôs breath and I could pretend mom was just asleep. Where my things were. She used to get mad at me and say i was purposely trying to avoid her. As a kid, I was just an introvert and needed time to recharge. It was innocent and it was where i felt safe. As an adult, I can see there is some merit to what she was saying - but it was never malicious and her yelling at me for it was unjustified. Anyways,

When I was 17, I decided to go to college out of state. I went clear across the country on a full ride scholarship. My initial plan was to go to school, and then go back to my home state. I never LOVED the state I went to college in, and I expressed that to her. The second we visited campus though, she stated she wanted to move to this state. I told her my plans of going home and she said she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt moving out here for me, she genuinely liked it.‚Äù I tried to warn her about the things I didn‚Äôt like, but she didn‚Äôt listen. She also made a comment about her not ‚Äúinfringing on my life‚Äù and she would live in her place and I would live in mine. She said she was not coming here for me. Again, she painted it as if i was telling her to stay far away from me. I just wanted to express my experiences to her and let her know my thoughts and experiences, because I had a feeling she would feel similarly. 

I graduated college (i was 21 turning 22 at this point) and ended up with an internship that had me staying in the state i went to college in for 2 additional years. I started to establish myself as an adult, got an apartment, car, and started my life. I believe she realized I wasn‚Äôt coming back (again that wasn‚Äôt the PLAN but opportunity presented itself), and decided to put her plan in motion to move here. Her talks of moving became more frequent - but the talks were always hypothetical. There was never any real action behind her move. I guess it‚Äôs also worth mentioning I was in my first apartment and it very much gave ‚Äúfirst apartment vibes‚Äù (popcorn ceiling, 1 bedroom, small, blinds that constantly fell, roaches etc. This will be important later.) Until one day - she sent me a picture of a 60 day notice she sent to her current landlord. She did not tell me she was doing it that day, she told me when it was done. At this point she had no housing secure, no job secured, no vehicle out here, nothing. When she told me that she did it, I was caught off guard and concerned, but she assured me she would figure it all out and that she was happy to move. 

During those 60 days I did everything in my power to help her. I had a stressful job at the time, but I dedicated all of my off days to touring apartments for her, offering to fill out and pay for applications, and giving her the small pieces of insight I had into areas that were nice. I believe I put forth as much effort as I possibly could to help her given we were across the country from each other and she decided to move to a state she had been to twice at that point. 

When the time came to move, she had to put all of her belongings in storage (which, 4 years later it‚Äôs still in storage). She still hadn‚Äôt secured housing, or a job or anything at that point. She came out here and she stayed in extended stays. She insisted she didn‚Äôt want to stay with me (and quite frankly, I didn‚Äôt want her to) but if she genuinely needed it I would have allowed. She survived off rental cars, found a job, and stayed in the extended stay until she secured an apartment (it took a while). She got a job, and I had gone with her to help her shop for a new car. I had bought my own car after someone stole my catalytic converter from my Prius (I STILL miss that car), and I figured I could help her through the car buying process (which is not a fun one). 

I genuinely tried to give her all of the time, help and assistance I could offer. I forgot to mention, in the midst of all this covid happened, things got expensive, I had to move a few times, I had my own health concerns, and I was starting to have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet on top of working an already stressful one, and just navigating the ebbs and flows of life as a young adult. I, once again, tried to help her as much as I could, and I thought I was doing what she needed. She constantly reassured that I was. 

After this, it was like a switch flipped, and she turned on me. She started calling me to verbally abuse me. She called me a Bitch, she said I was selfish, evil, disrespectful, that i should have been aborted, that I will ‚Äúsee when she‚Äôs dead‚Äù (her favorite long throughout my childhood) and ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to me. She said I did nothing to help her, and that I take joy in watching her suffer. She would call me at random times to curse me out or call me out of my name. As random as this sounds, I promise, it was as random as it was. Some nights, I could tell that she was not sober. (Although, looking back on it, I think she was more not sober than I realized at the time). This went on for a WHILE. Like it had to be at least 2 years of sustained abuse. And it was almost like I went through a series of emotions in real time. Confusion and trying to make sense of what was happening, internalizing it and feeling so terrible about myself, anger that she would speak to me in that way. This went on for a really long time (and actually I ended up going to the ER for chest pains in the midst of this. I am convinced that this contributed heavily to the stress I was under at the time thus triggering the discomfort). 

She called me one day and she apologized. She promised that she would go to AA and that the things she said were because of that. I accepted the apology and we talked for a while. 

And long story longer, she would revert back to calling me disrespectful, she would say that I want to see her suffer, that I am selfish. But when I confront her about saying those things, she said that she apologized already and that I want someone to ‚Äúbow down to me.‚Äù She has continuously called me a bitch (with the last occurrence being November 11th) and when I tell her that I do not wish to be spoken to that way and I deserve respect, she says that she already apologized and that God preaches forgiveness. I tell her that apologies without changed behavior don‚Äôt really mean much and the Bible said ‚Äúfaith without works is dead‚Äù she told me to ‚Äúkeep her, her maker, her faith out of my hypocritical mouth.‚Äù 

These years I have went from having a good relationship with my mom, to her turning on me for some odd reason, to just me being exhausted by her. There are parts that I left out but it‚Äôs more patterns of the same behavior, basically. 

Three weeks ago I texted her two questions that were basically 1. why do you continuously blame me for a bad relationship with you and us not seeing each other on me when i‚Äôm the only one putting effort into this relationship (I had asked multiple times if i could visit her, if i could get coffee with her, she wad supposed to come over Christmas and New Year‚Äôs to which all she agreed to then at the last minute said she was too tired from work to come)? A relationship takes work and if it feels one sided after a while, people will stop trying to overextend themselves. 

and 2. why, when you get angry do you call me out of my name and disrespect me? I understand you may be upset but that doesn‚Äôt give you the right to disrespect me. I may get angry at situations but never have called you out of your name, so I would appreciate the same respect. 

She said that I was ‚Äúbrewing in a stew of anger‚Äù and that God forgives and that she already apologized and etc etc

I am just tired. As I mentioned there is more context to parts of this but this is the overall gist. 

To end, I am pregnant currently and these are my questions/feelings:

1. Did I misstep at all? I genuinely feel like I‚Äôve done all I can and possibly more than a lot of others would. 

2. It almost feels like when she came to the state and saw me self sufficient, she turned on me? I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs upset I have stability that she doesn‚Äôt? Or that I won‚Äôt just allow her to speak to me any type of way because I‚Äôm an adult and she feels her authority is threatened?   Idk if i‚Äôm reading into this right. 

3. I asked her today, as a last attempt, if we could talk face to face. I genuinely want to express myself and give her a space to express herself. I am not angry, I really am trying to maintain my energy to be as composed as possible. She refused and assumes I want to yell and argue. If the conversation was productive I was going to tell her I was pregnant at that time. Is it wrong of me to not text her and if she doesn‚Äôt want to speak face to face, just kinda‚Ä¶ proceed with my pregnancy at peace and when she finds out she finds out?

Lastly, is there any advice for going no contact? Or low contact? I am just tired of being disrespected and being called disrespectful. I am tired of not being treated well by her for seemingly no reason. I am just tired. ",8,1734704277.0,raisedbynarcissists,5,1.0,False
