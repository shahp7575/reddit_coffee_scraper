‚Ä¢im 18 years old

‚Ä¢im in my healthy weight and height range

‚Ä¢i do gym

As far as I know, we were not aware of our insecurities; we never identified them ourselves. They were often pointed out by others.

For me, it was my family and closest friends. Initially, it didn't really matter, but someone hearing it repeatedly might become hesitant about fitting in with others, especially a young girl of 12üß∏. It was my forehead, my nose, my teeth, my figure, the way I laugh, the way I talk, and the constant pressure to be in the top 10 in exams.

I have bangs now, can't really cut out and stitch back my forehead. I had a chiropractic session for my nose (I have deviated septum), I have crown teeth now, I ate less and did gym more, I cover my mouth whenever I laugh, I don't talk that much now. ‚òòÔ∏è

Is it really worth it? I use my hands to guard my bangs, I still have deviated septum and rhinitis(hereditary), can't drink coffee from fear of staining, didn't have my period for 2 months from extreme dieting. They say ‚Äúbeauty is pain‚Äù.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

üìçNow the real problem is my snoring. Deviated septum+rhinitis


. My family members have sinus and I'm one of them (passed down by my grandpa) . When I was in hostel for my 12th, we would share two beds for like 8 people and I would sleep in the middle. The first day others would say someone was snoring, not loud but weirdly. Turned out it was ME‚ùó. I've never knew I snore. I thought the only problem i have is sleeping with my mouth open and now thatt?!!. I was embrassesed at first. Full of strangers from different school laughing at me. üö∫

OF COURSE I ignored it. It wasn't something I could control. But theyyyy would always find a way to blame my snoring for the disturbance in their studies (sh*theads were studying in bed not in study room).

After I came out from that hell, I asked my mom about this matter and she told me I'd been snoring for like 4 years now. 4YEARSSS! I don't think that's normal for young people. My mom is not sharing a bed with my dad. She refused to sleep besides him. Why!? Because he snores like crazy.üîä

I'm afraid I'll never find a spouse who would sleep besides me even when I snore. The girls in my hostel said that my future husband will definitely divorce me coz of my snoring. Even my own parents don't wanna share a bed with each other. üí≠

I've tried recording myself. It's not loud, just little weird because of my breathing problems. I've tried massages, steamer, allergy pills before bed and even those snore preventing stickers. I feel so pathetic and annoyed at myself . So for my OWN sake not becoz of their criticism, I'll have a Septoplasty in the future with my own money .üéØ(atleast it'll help with sleep apnea)",1,1734256971.0,story,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been in Chattanooga for almost 13 years, and while this city has become home, I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs time to branch out and meet some new people. Life is so much better with good company and shared laughs, so here‚Äôs a little about me:

-I‚Äôm a proud mom to some amazing boys‚Äîfull-on soccer mom life over here! I spend a lot of time cheering on the sidelines (Go CFC!). Whether it‚Äôs youth games or the pros, I love the energy of the soccer community.

-I‚Äôm single, recently divorced within the past two months. It‚Äôs been a big life change, but I‚Äôm embracing this new chapter and excited to build meaningful connections. No ex drama - I'm on good terms with my kids' dad.

-I don‚Äôt drink alcohol‚Äîit‚Äôs just not my thing‚Äîbut I‚Äôm totally cool if you do. Whether it‚Äôs a brewery hangout, a coffee shop, or a fun spot around town, I‚Äôm happy to join in and enjoy the atmosphere.

-I‚Äôm a foodie who loves discovering new restaurants, trying unique dishes, or talking about everything from street tacos to fine dining. Food is my love language, so I‚Äôm always up for grabbing a bite or sharing recipe ideas.

-I‚Äôm an avid runner, and running is my therapy. Whether I‚Äôm training for a race or just clearing my head on a trail, it‚Äôs a huge part of who I am. If you‚Äôre into running or looking for a buddy, I‚Äôd love to connect.

-Live music is my thing. Big concerts, small local shows, outdoor festivals‚ÄîI‚Äôm all about soaking up the energy and good vibes of live performances.

-I love the little, wholesome joys in life, like bowling, ice skating, hiking, or just exploring fun spots around Chattanooga.

-I love to laugh and appreciate people with a great sense of humor. If you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt take life too seriously, we‚Äôll probably get along just fine.

-Politically, I lean liberal, so if that‚Äôs something that matters to you, there's that.


I‚Äôm looking for friendships that go beyond small talk. I want to meet people who enjoy meaningful conversations, share some of my interests, and are open to creating authentic connections.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out! Let‚Äôs grab coffee, catch a game, or just chat and see where it goes.

Looking forward to meeting you!

1hepgie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hepgie/why_is_emerald_cave_green/,Why is Emerald Cave green?,"Just got back from an incredible kayaking adventure at the Emerald Cave near Las Vegas - Here's everything you need to know! (Including some tips I wish I knew before going)

Hey everyone! I wanted to share my recent experience kayaking to the stunning Emerald Cave on the Colorado River. This hidden gem sits right between Nevada and Arizona, and let me tell you - it's absolutely worth checking out.

I did a ton of research before booking, and I went with this specific tour (https://athometouch.com/EmeraldCave) because of the amazing reviews and reasonable price point. Honestly, it exceeded all my expectations.

The tour starts at Willow Beach Marina in Arizona, about 45 minutes from Vegas. Pro tip: Get there early to use the restroom and grab some coffee from the marina store. Our guide, Mike, was super knowledgeable and made sure everyone was comfortable with their kayaks before we hit the water.

The paddle to Emerald Cave is roughly 4 miles round trip, but don't let that intimidate you. The pace is super chill, and they make several stops along the way. The best part? You don't need any previous kayaking experience. I saw kids as young as 8 having a blast!

Now, about the cave itself - pictures don't do it justice. When the sunlight hits just right, the water glows this incredible emerald green color. It's like something out of a movie. We spent about 20 minutes there taking photos and swimming. The water was refreshing, and the views of Black Canyon were breathtaking.

Some things I wish I knew beforehand:
- Wear water shoes (the rocks can be slippery)
- Bring a waterproof phone case
- Apply sunscreen BEFORE you get there
- Pack a light jacket (it can be breezy on the water)
- Arrive 15 minutes early to get sorted

The whole experience takes about 4 hours, and they provide everything you need - kayaks, paddles, life vests, water, and even some snacks. For $74, it's honestly a steal considering what you get.

If you're thinking about doing this tour, I'd highly recommend booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/EmeraldCave. They limit group sizes to 12 people max, which keeps the experience intimate and ensures you get personal attention from the guide.

Quick heads up - they require at least 4 people for the early morning tour (7am), and if you're bringing kids under 9, they'll need to share a kayak with an adult. Also, you'll need to drive yourself to the marina, as transportation isn't included.

I've done a lot of activities around Vegas, but this was definitely one of the highlights. If you're looking for something different from the usual Strip experience, this is it. The 97% recommendation rate speaks for itself!

Feel free to drop any questions in the comments. I'll do my best to answer them based on my experience!

A (not so) short travelogue (+ a little bit of bragging) :)","On November 19^(th), an unbelievable two days of audiophile bliss, listening to the legendary Sennheiser HE-1 headphone, meeting lovely people from all over the world, fine dining and equally as fine Whisky began for us 6 lucky winners of the Sennheiser ‚ÄúTullamore Audiophile Experience‚Äù.

[The \\""Golden Ticket\\""](https://preview.redd.it/fg5a7wwlzy6e1.jpg?width=2868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=448e71d16e0d345444fb73f66411939e88e70035)

For me, everything began with relatively short car drive to Frankfurt airport in Germany. From there, Lufthansa safely landed at Dublin airport a couple of hours later where two very lovely people from Sennheiser (thanks Nicole and Arne!) waited for everyone to arrive there (which took a while as the 6 of us travelled from the likes of Guernsey, Germany, Northern Irleland, the United States and so on). From there, it was a one hour shuttle drive to our hotel residence in Tullamore, Ireland where we had a bit of a rest before heading to an excellent restaurant nearby to have the first of our two dinners together.

[The group arrives at the hotel in Tullamore.](https://preview.redd.it/jnc4u8if1z6e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a63ceed6415af42e1584b241a47b1760589b7df)

That's all well and good, you say, but where is the ""Audiophile Experience""? Right you are! Here we go.

The next morning, a shuttle bus picked us up and drove is from the hotel directly to the Sennheiser factory where we were only allowed to take pictures in the entance area (but we were accompanied by a professional film crew the whole day, so there will likely be actual footage to be seen soon, I think).

Impressions from there:

We were then invited for a very thorough and detailed tour of the actual factory facilities where we got to see all the amazing technology, the machines and the production of Sennheiser headphones. It was all very impressive there. High-tech as far as the eye could see. We saw and touched razor thin diaphragms and voice coils way thinner than a human hair. Everything is checked several times by various machines and tolerances are extremely tight throughout all the processes there. Super exciting stuff, really (but, again, no pics allowed sadly :) )

One of the best parts of the factory was that we were shown how to build and package our own HD 650 headphones which we all did while having a smile on our faces the entire time. It was an amazing experience.

[My self-made and well packed HD 650 unit :D](https://preview.redd.it/wh3efieucz6e1.jpg?width=2747&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e047b9c212c223ccf6eabe9478a9760dc76123c0)

The people at the factory were so nice and helpful which enhanced our experience there even further. Huge thanks again to everyone at the Tullamore factory! You guys really made our day there!

Once that was done, we finally got to listen to the legendary Sennheiser HE-1 headphones. Sadly, I forgot to bring 69k with me, so I wasn't able to buy it one site but listening to it was a rather nice compensation for it :)

HE-1 impressions:

[The HE-1 is a rather enjoyable experience, let me tell you!](https://preview.redd.it/dv48kw5m8z6e1.jpg?width=1903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eebdb6bbe145e92ed4ddaecc8d8faf85c9aff0f1)

[Ask the man how he thought it sounded! ](https://preview.redd.it/syc9e2np9z6e1.jpg?width=4250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a704b5622d647dd088e06334114e17b6a26993b)

So, I think there have been many impressions about how the HE-1 sounds on the internet over the years and I want to make it as short as possible: It was the most ""life-like"" experience wearing headphones that I have ever experienced. You just forget that you wear them. The music plays as if it is really in the same room as you are. Highly resolving, spacious and real. Nothing sounds off. It was the most perfect sound experience I have ever had. Absolutely incredible headphones. It is able to reproduce music in an effortless and somehow magically relaxing way that is hard to describe to those who haven't listened to it yet. Let me tell you, if you ever have the chance...do it. That's pretty much all I can say to the HE-1. Amazing.

Afterwards, we had lunch at the factory, had a couple of interviews with the film crew there and still had a little bit of time to listen to some other headphones that were available there for us. Before the trip, I never had the chance to listen to the HD 820 and the IE 900 for example. So, I took the chance there and was especially impressed by the IE 900 (already owning the IE 600 myself) - it's an excellent IEM!

After the factory, we visited the Tullamore D.E.W. Whiskey Distillery for an excellent guided tour including a Whiskey tasting (that Irish Coffee there was soo good, my god) which made and already unforgettable day even more unforgettable!

From there, it was back to the hotel with people in a pretty good mood, I can tell you!

In the evening, we had a final dinner and visited another pub in Tullamore to round everything off in style!

As his Luna and bearer of his mark, the mindlink gives Leila access to all of Tatum‚Äôs physical senses and what she sees in her vision cripples her heart, forcing the tears she has been holding back to run down the corner of her eyes.

Whatever hope she held out that she meant something to him instantly shatters and an unbearable pain rips through her.

A pained smile curves up Leila‚Äôs lips and she is about to cut the mindlink when Tatum‚Äôs voice barrages into her head.

‚ÄòWhat is it?‚Äô

The coldness of his voice hurt her even more than the image in her vision. It‚Äôs like this man feels absolutely nothing but irritation towards her since Carmela returned.

Before Leila can even form words in her head, Carmela notices the glow in Tatum‚Äôs eyes and guesses it‚Äôs Leila mindlinking him.

She jumps down from his legs, knowing Leila can hear and see her through Tatum‚Äôs senses.
‚ÄúYou should go to your wife Alpha, I didn‚Äôt mean to keep you from her,‚Äù She says in a pitiful tone, bowing her head.

‚ÄúPlease forgive me Leila.‚Ä¶..I just find it hard to sleep alone, two years abandoned in a dark confined room has made me- has made me-‚Äù she starts to heave and sob, tears cascading down her pretty brown eyes and she clutches her top against her chest, amplifying her act.
Tatum is on his feet almost immediately, pulling her into his arms tightly.

‚ÄúShhh‚Ä¶.you‚Äôre safe now my dear, no one will harm you ever again. I promise,‚Äù He says in a calm and soothing voice, running his fingers down her blonde hair.

Leila purses her lips and sobs silently, seeing the intimacy between her best friend and her husband. She feels pity for Carmela who sacrificed herself for her years ago but at the same time, the loss of the man she loves breaks her heart.

She has to make an impossible choice. A selfish one or a selfless one, to fight for him or to let her have him.

‚ÄòPrepare a room for her in the house tomorrow, She‚Äôll be moving in with us.‚Äô

Tatum‚Äôs curt voice reminds her that the choice is not hers to make but his.

She sniffs and wipes her face with the back of her hands, a crippling ache stabbing at her heart and she cuts the mindlink.

There is only one choice she has to make, actually two. Get rid of the baby and get a divorce, this was never meant to be her life.
‚Äî

‚ÄúTatum‚Ä¶..please help me-‚Äù
Leila heaves a sad sigh and opens her eyes, the empty space beside her on the bed reminds her that her husband spent the night in the arms of another woman. The sorrow and emptiness she feels in her heart is palpable and she purses her lips together, promising herself not to let the tears stinging her eyes fall.

She knows what she needs to do, she needs to put an end to her misery before she becomes too miserable, this pain of loss that she feels for what was never hers has to go, before it completely consumes her.

Tonight, she will make the first move and tell him that she wants a divorce before he tells her. She‚Äôs not sure that her poor heart can take it hearing those words from him, no matter how much she expects it, so she will take the initiative and save herself the pain by rejecting him first.

She opens the mindlink but quickly closes it, the intimate moment of Alpha Tatum and Carmela returning to her memory as vividly as she saw it last night, sending a pang of pain through her heart.

The way his arms tenderly wrapped around Carmela, the softness of his voice, the affection in his eyes as he spoke to her, it hurt her Leila over again but she has to remind herself that she is the impostor in this love triangle.

She shudders and grabs her phone from the dresser, only to freeze and stare blankly at her wallpaper, her heart clenching with pain and she sniffs, throwing her head up to stop herself from crying, because no matter how much tears she sheds, the huge smile of the handsome man on her phone screen is something that she will never see again or rather, something he will never do for her sake again.
[Good morning, when you get some time, there‚Äôs something I want to talk about.] She texts him.

The door to the room suddenly opens and Alpha Tatum steps inside, making Leila‚Äôs heart pound at his sight, wondering when he got back.

Tatum glances at his phone and shoves it in his pocket, holding a mug of hot brewing coffee, showing off his ripped and naked upper body with his joggers hanging low on his waist, sexily displaying how his adonis V shape disappears into it and Leila looks away.

Basically I (22M) have been seeing a girl (22F) for 5 months now. It had a very messy start because I knew her for a few months before we started dating and we would always go for coffees and meet each other when going out since we had overlapping friend groups, all whilst she was in another relationship.

Although I initally had pure intentions, I started developing feelings for her and thought that she maybe felt something back despite being in another relationship. 

Although I felt bad about it I had to express how I felt. In one evening I ended up telling her how I felt, we were both tipsy and we talked for a long time, she told me she was in a relationship where she loved her bf and would never overstep that boundary, nevertheless we still stayed up until 5am talking, she also sent me messages the next day saying she was feeling a bit confused now.

Then, 2 days later, her boyfriend broke up with her for unrelated reasons. She seemed extremely broken over it so I thought it would be best not to get involved for a month, but 1 month after the breakup I asked her out on a date and since then things have been going well. Now after 5 months we're in a relationship and we love each other. 

However, I can't help feeling like I was just the second choice, and I talked to her about it a month ago and inquired on how the breakup happened. During the breakup he said some bad things and acted like a POS. Turns out he broke up because he started resenting her for the way he felt she treated him, which apparently he never communicated before, after which she tried everything to salvage the relationship. 2 weeks after he broke up with her he felt better again and asked her on out on a date to be on good terms again after which they hooked up, then the next day he said he changed up and broke things off again.

After hearing this, I started feeling bad. I was there as an option and she chose a guy that broke up with her and was an asshole 2 weeks ago over me. I can't help think if he wouldn't have been an asshole the second time around they would have just gotten back together. I understand that it's my fault in the first place for getting involved but I'm now in a relationship with her and don't know what to do. She barely mentions him and also constantly shows how much she loves me. I communicated to her how I felt and she's very understanding and trying to help.

Thoughts of potentially being a second choice or her having spent 1 year of her life with this guy have been eating me alive. It's affecting my ability to sleep, concetrate and even my appetite. Due to this I haven't been able to enjoy our relationship the last 3 weeks which my girlfriend is aware of and it's also affecting her very negatively. 

She has been handling this situation very well and has tried everything to help me. I find her amazing and still love her, she doesn't care abt him anymore, but can't help thinking about the past. I have tried to fight through and even started therapy but I'm currently just considering breaking up to relieve the pain for me. I don't know if this is reasonable but I'm not sure if I could stay with someone longterm if this is how it started. Rn I'm looking for second opinions on what I should do.

1hepato,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1hepato/letter_i_wrote_to_a_marriage_influencer_wanted_to/,Letter I wrote to a marriage influencer. Wanted to share here too. ,"Jimmy,

I know you probably get hundreds of messages like this from husbands daily but I wanted to share my thoughts with you.

My wife and I have been married 7 years. We dated 5 years before that so we've been together 12 years. I'm 38 and she's 39.

A year into the marriage I lost my job at the county. I was a mental health case manager. She has been a hair stylist the whole time. The economic and emotional toll of losing that job nearly destroyed us. On top of that I was arrested for visiting sex workers. So she nearly left and had every right to. We managed to get throigh this just by grit and hope. I got another job and we sort of got on with life. I did some therapy and inner work to address why I was seeking sex outside of marriage and focused all of my energy emotional and physical into her.

We were still stagnant and she began to hate our Townhouse. She felt trapped here, it was outdated, hard to organize and small for a family of 3. She had a child from a¬† previous marriage who I bonded with and am as much a father as anyone. My credit got bad and we soon didn't qualify for a home loan. By all means our life went on hold. She stated numerous times she was unhappy that we weren't moving forward. Often she would fight and yell and was physically abusive to me. I would yell back and become resentful, listing off in detail every cent that I contributed to the household and how I wa always broke because my paycheck went to bills and rent. She would then say that she pays for the vacations and groceries and the cell phone. It would just go on like this. When we fight I always try to start with using words like; concern, conflict, collaborate etc.. I try to listen and validate. Eventually I give up and yell back, throw her behaviors at her, etc.. I can deescalate and I'm the only one who will. I'll chill out, take a break and walk the dog. The reoccurring issue is cleaning and organizing. It's been such an issue that now my domestic duties are all of them! Washing, dishes & kitchen, coffee, floors swept & mopped, toilets and showers. Laundry isn't done til it's folded and she'll berate me if I wash them only. She wanted us to collaborate on the Christmas decorations and Holiday activities so I pulled out all the Christmas decorations and set up the tree and the decorations are in boxes in the living room and they're not all up and it's stressing her out but I feel like she could also help put things on the tree and put some lights up doing this together used to be a tradition that we had. 

The last 2 years she has cheated on me, then requested to be a poly relationship which she then proceeded to find a boyfriend but that's a whole can of worms. It's caused enormous hurt and distrust in me obviously. She refuses to acknowledge it. I'm waiting until after the holidays to have a sit-down long discussion regarding the infidelity and the polyamory and I'm going to request that we close the marriage until we feel like we're in a better place and healthier., her toxicity blood into the other relationship she was pursuing and he broke up with her!

I've sent her tons of your clips. I try to use language of healing, kindness, forgiveness, deescalation, curiosity. I'm trying to utilize all the actions and language that is all over relationship-tok. She's hesitant about counseling, while we both still enjoy sex sometimes she uses it as a cudgel against me saying that I'm preoccupied with sex when I explained to her that while that's one of the ways I like to connect with you if we could just say a few nice things to each other and and just hold my hand it would suffice.

In some of your shorts you describe¬† how conflicts are going to happen but at the end usually both Partners say ""I feel this way because I love you and want us to work together and want things to be great"" she rarely affirms her love for me verbally or with physical touch. She truly is a differnent kind of girl and plays more of masculine dynamic while I am stronger at identifying emotions and active listening. 

Most of my support people and strangers too sometimes say that I should divorce her. I am ambivalent, I go back and forth I think 100% that I should have looked back on some of the the anger and abuse that has been present from day one that she's just an angry person with a lot of unresolved trauma. 

While I'm listing off a ton of problems there are a lot of positives there is a lot of love and there's a lot of history. I think a lot of marriages can be worked out, I'm trying to push through this, get to a better place, get to building a life and I think that we can get there and but I need buy - in from her that we can or wants to go in. A lot of women would not put up with the financial difficulties I've placed on us. 

I'm looking for new jobs, I'm putting in applications, I'm trying to keep the house maintained and cleaned and organized and do the paperwork and take care of the insurance while some of these things come really easy to some men it's a challenge to me I fully admit that I may be a bit of a man baby. 

Sorry to dump a huge letter to you on the chat invite but I wanted to just in case if you didn't reply that you'd still have the information like an email. Thank you for inspiring me to have healthier communication and do better!

**Here's what happens:**

During the checkout, you'll be redirected to the bank's page for OTP, and for some reason, you'll bumped back to the checkout page. Giving you the feeling that the transaction has failed. Your cart remains intact and you get the feeling that there is need for the payment to be completed (because you were bumped back to the checkout page). But little do you know that the order was confirmed and if you pay again, you'll just end up creating a of duplicate order.

Fun Fact: Swiggy (Food orders) will warn you if you are creating a duplicate order. Instamart doesn't.

It has happened to me twice. Once i ended up with [3 same instamart orders](https://x.com/SahRckr/status/1864313587482706286). But this time around I didn't make the payment the second time, an here is what I found.

**Un-canning the Con:**

I don't have Screenshots till I wasn't redirect to the pay for it again page. At this moment I decided to check my email for transactions. And I can see that i was charged for this order already. The order was paid for at 3:39 PM.

Order not yet showing up in the Instamart order history (the very same minute). I understand that the order may not be confirmed, but it should be in a transient state, right?

Normally the cart is emptied out post successful checkout, but this doesn't seem to be happening with Instamart orders.

As usual, Swiggy support is useless. I emailed them with details of my previous order.

1hep3x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1hep3x4/how_free_vpns_help_in_public_wifi_security/,How Free VPNs Help in Public Wi-Fi Security,"In today's digital age, the importance of safeguarding your online privacy cannot be overstated. Every time we use our devices, from checking social media to browsing websites, we leave behind digital footprints that can potentially compromise our privacy. Whether it‚Äôs personal information or private browsing habits, hackers and third parties are always looking for ways to access our data. This is where a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can make a massive difference.

VPNs are designed to keep your internet connection secure and private by creating a protected tunnel for your data to travel through. Whether you're browsing on your iPhone or iPad, using a VPN ensures that your information remains private and secure. While there are many paid VPN services available, free VPNs offer an equally valuable option for those looking to stay safe online without breaking the bank.

# Introduction to the Importance of Online Privacy

The Growing Threats to Digital Privacy  
With the rapid evolution of technology, our online activity has become a goldmine for data brokers, hackers, and even governments. From browsing habits to personal preferences, our data can be used to build detailed profiles for marketing or worse, fall into the hands of malicious actors. Unfortunately, many people remain unaware of the risks, using unsecured public networks or sharing sensitive information without considering the consequences. Online privacy has become more than just a buzzword; it‚Äôs a necessity.

How VPNs Can Help Protect Your Information  
A VPN works by masking your IP address and routing your traffic through a secure server. This process encrypts your online activity, making it almost impossible for anyone to intercept or track it. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi networks, which are vulnerable to hackers and eavesdroppers. By using a VPN, your data is shielded from potential threats, ensuring that your sensitive information remains private.

# What is a VPN and How Does it Work?

Understanding VPN Technology  
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that creates a private network over a public internet connection. It encrypts your data, ensuring that even if someone intercepts it, they won‚Äôt be able to read or access it. VPNs are widely used to protect data on personal computers, smartphones, and tablets, and they offer several other benefits such as bypassing geo-restrictions and maintaining anonymity online.

How a VPN Encrypts Your Internet Traffic  
When you connect to the internet through a VPN, your device sends data to the VPN server first, which then sends it to the destination website. During this process, the data is encrypted, which makes it unreadable to anyone attempting to intercept it. The VPN server also masks your IP address, making it harder for third parties to track your online activity. This encryption is essential for ensuring that your data remains safe, particularly on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

# The Benefits of Using a Free VPN on Your iPhone or iPad

Protecting Your Privacy on Public Wi-Fi Networks  
One of the primary benefits of using a VPN on your iPhone or iPad is the enhanced security it provides when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. Public Wi-Fi, such as those in cafes, airports, and hotels, are often unsecured, making it easier for hackers to intercept your data. A free VPN can protect your sensitive information from prying eyes, ensuring that your online activity remains private even when using these networks.

Unlocking Restricted Content  
Another advantage of using a VPN on your iOS device is the ability to access content that may be restricted in your region. Whether it‚Äôs streaming services, websites, or apps, many online platforms impose geo-restrictions that prevent users from certain areas from accessing their content. By using a free VPN for iOS, you can easily change your virtual location and access content as if you were in a different country.

Safeguarding Your Personal Data  
Privacy breaches have become more common, with data being stolen from individuals, companies, and even governments. Using a VPN on your iPhone or iPad ensures that your personal data is encrypted and protected from potential breaches. This is particularly important for individuals who store sensitive information on their devices, such as bank account details or passwords.

Enhanced Security for Mobile Browsing  
With the increasing reliance on smartphones and tablets for browsing the internet, it's essential to have an added layer of security. A free VPN for iOS encrypts your web traffic, protecting you from hackers, tracking cookies, and other digital threats. This allows for safer browsing while also protecting your identity from websites that collect your personal information for advertising purposes.

# How a Free VPN for iOS Improves Your Experience

Easy Installation and Setup  
One of the reasons people hesitate to use a VPN is because they believe it will be complicated to set up. However, a free VPN for iOS is simple to install and configure. Most free VPN apps come with easy-to-follow instructions, and in many cases, you only need to download the app and activate it to start protecting your data. This ease of use ensures that even those with limited tech knowledge can enjoy the benefits of online privacy.

The Convenience of Having Mobile Privacy  
In today‚Äôs world, we do everything on our mobile devices, from shopping to social networking. Ensuring your mobile device is secure is crucial. With a free VPN on your iPhone or iPad, you can browse the internet, check emails, and use apps with the peace of mind that your data is protected. This convenience of having mobile privacy means that you don‚Äôt have to worry about the security risks associated with online activities.

Keeping Your Internet Traffic Private  
Using a free VPN on your iOS device ensures that your internet traffic is encrypted and kept private. Whether you‚Äôre accessing your email, shopping online, or browsing social media, your browsing activity will be shielded from hackers, advertisers, and even your internet service provider (ISP). By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN ensures that no one can see your online behavior.

# Cost-Effectiveness of Free VPN Services

Why Free VPNs Are Accessible to Everyone  
Not everyone can afford a paid VPN service, and that‚Äôs where free VPNs come in. Free VPNs are a great way to gain the benefits of online privacy and security without having to pay for a subscription. These services allow you to enjoy the advantages of a VPN without worrying about recurring fees. For students, travelers, or anyone on a budget, free VPNs make privacy accessible to all.

Saving Money Without Compromising Privacy  
When it comes to privacy tools, many people think that you have to pay to get the best service. However, free VPNs offer a cost-effective solution that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice privacy. While some free services may have limitations compared to paid versions, they still provide the essential protection needed to keep your data secure. This means you can enjoy online privacy without spending money.

The Value of Using Free Services Without Hidden Costs

Potential Health Impacts of Regular Hydrogen Water Consumption
--------------------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen water has taken the wellness community by storm, promising several potential health benefits. But what is hydrogen water, and how might it impact your health? Hydrogen water is simply water infused with hydrogen gas, making it different from regular water. The small hydrogen molecules are believed to offer unique advantages, and this article will dive into the science behind regular consumption and its potential health impacts.

### What Are the Benefits of Hydrogen Water?

Fans of hydrogen water claim it has various health benefits. Here are a few notable potential effects:

- **Antioxidant Properties:** Hydrogen water is known for its antioxidant properties. Antioxidants help combat oxidative stress, which is linked to numerous health issues, including inflammation and chronic diseases.
- **Enhanced Athletic Performance:** Some athletes consume hydrogen water for its purported ability to reduce fatigue. Studies suggest that it may help decrease lactic acid build-up during exercise, potentially improving performance.
- **Improved Skin Health:** Some advocates argue that hydrogen water may promote healthier skin. Its antioxidant properties could help reduce UV-induced skin damage and improve overall complexion.
- **Support for Metabolic Health:** There is emerging evidence that hydrogen water may support metabolic health by promoting better glucose metabolism and reducing insulin resistance.

### Understanding the Science

The science behind hydrogen water revolves around its molecular structure. When hydrogen gas dissolves in water, it creates a solution that is believed to have healing properties. The key lies in the small size of the hydrogen molecules, which allows them to penetrate cells easily and exert their effects. Here‚Äôs how:

- **Cellular Penetration:** Unlike larger molecules, hydrogen molecules can easily enter cells, where they can exert their antioxidant effects.
- **Selective Antioxidant:** Hydrogen is unique because it selectively neutralizes harmful free radicals (reactive oxygen species) while leaving beneficial free radicals intact.

### Research Insights

Various studies have examined the effects of hydrogen water on health. While the research is still in its early stages, the findings so far are promising:

### How to Incorporate Hydrogen Water into Your Routine

If you are considering trying hydrogen water, here‚Äôs how you can add it to your daily regimen:

- **Use a Hydrogen Water Generator:** You can purchase a generator that infuses water with hydrogen gas, allowing you to create hydrogen water at home.
- **Buy Bottled Hydrogen Water:** Many health food stores and online retailers sell pre-packaged hydrogen water for convenience.
- **Stay Hydrated:** You can make hydrogen water a part of your hydration routine. Drink it before workouts or throughout the day to maximize benefits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Achieving a brighter smile is a common desire for many individuals, and teeth whitening is a popular solution. However, with numerous methods available, it is essential to understand each option to determine what best suits your needs. Here, we explore various teeth whitening methods to help you make an informed decision.

### Professional Dental Treatments

Professional teeth whitening treatments are one of the most effective methods for achieving noticeable results. Dentists provide customized care, ensuring that your specific needs are met. The most common types include:

- **In-office Whitening:** This method involves applying a high-concentration bleaching agent directly to your teeth. The entire process typically takes about an hour and can lighten teeth several shades in just one visit.
- **Take-home Kits:** Dentists provide custom-fit trays and a professional-grade whitening gel for at-home use. You‚Äôll usually wear the trays for a few hours each day or overnight for a specified period.

Both professional options yield impressive results and are customized for safety and effectiveness, making them a reliable choice for those looking to enhance their smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Over-the-Counter Products

If you prefer at-home solutions, over-the-counter (OTC) whitening products are widely available and can also be effective. Some common OTC products include:

- **Whitening Strips:** These flexible strips are coated with a peroxide-based gel that adheres to your teeth. They are simple to use and typically require daily application for a couple of weeks.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While toothpaste can remove surface stains, it usually contains mild abrasives and whitening agents that provide subtle results over time.
- **Whitening Pens:** These are convenient and perfect for touch-ups. You simply apply the gel to your teeth when needed, but they may not produce as dramatic results as other methods.

OTC products are generally more affordable and convenient, but results can vary based on the product and duration of use.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Methods

Some individuals gravitate towards natural methods for a more holistic approach. While these methods may take longer, they are often gentler on the teeth. Common natural techniques include:

- **Baking Soda and Hydrogen Peroxide:** A paste made of these two ingredients can be used as a gentle abrasive to help remove stains.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** While it has mild whitening properties, be cautious as it can be acidic and may damage enamel with excessive use.
- **Activated Charcoal:** This method involves brushing with charcoal powder, which some believe can absorb stains. However, scientific evidence supporting this method is limited.

Natural methods are appealing for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, results may not be as pronounced as those from professional treatments.

### At-home Whitening Devices

The rise of at-home teeth whitening devices, such as LED lights combined with whitening gels, has become popular. These devices offer a quick and user-friendly option for many people.

The process usually involves applying a whitening gel to your teeth and using an LED light to enhance the whitening effect. These devices often come with instructions on how long to use them, typically ranging from 10 to 30 minutes per session. While results can vary, many users report a noticeable difference after a series of treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Method

Choosing the right whitening method depends on various factors, such as:

- **Sensitivity:** If you have sensitive teeth, professional treatments or gentler OTC products may be favorable.
- **Budget:** Consider how much you are willing to spend, as prices vary widely between professional treatments and OTC products.
- **Time:** Some methods require more time and commitment than others, so evaluate how much effort you are willing to invest.
- **Desired Results:** Think about how quickly you want to see results. Professional treatments can provide significant changes in one session.

1hep1z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1hep1z5/someone_suggest_some_fragrance_i_should_look_into/,Someone suggest some fragrance I should look into based on my favourite fragrances.,"I recently picked up a couple of hyped clones which I was absolutely disgusted by. I'm still trying to recover from the regret so I'm seeking recommendations for fragrances I should look into based on my favourites. So please help me out.

Here is a list of my favorites:

1. Libre Intense - my go to office scent 

2. Nishane Hacivat - love the sweet pineapply citrus and sort of moldy cold base. I have the cheaper mixed version of and not the original. Smells exactly the same but really poor performance. Saving up to buy an original bottle.

3. Mancera Cedrat Boise - I really used to seek citrus scents when I sampled creed aventus and joined that hype train a couple years back. I do not own the original, also a cheaper mixed version.

4. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa - sweet with coffee. No brainer, I own an unopened backup bottle. This is the only coffee fragrance I've put to my nose.

5. Alhambra Tabac/Smokey/fragrance world tobacco gourmand - i enjoy the honey+tobacco combo with fruits.

6. French Avenue After effect - the rum and tobacco gives off a sexy mature vibe. Still waiting on an event to wear this to. 

7. Lataffa Nebras - smells delicious like cold iced chocolate cake.


These are the fragrance I picked up and hated and I probably will sell or give them away.

1. FW Tobacco Myth - Smells like an old moldy sharp fragrant basement.

2. Lattafa Vintage radio - I didn't understand what I was smelling. It's smells chaotic.

3. Paris FA Royal blend - I am so done with the angels share clones. Angels share isn't that great either.

4. Mpf Artistry - awful chaotic blue 

5. Paris FA Liquid brun - another chaotic offensive synthetic smelling fragrance.

6. Maison Alhambra Jean Lowe azure - the citrus is not for me. Smells familiar like a cleaner I used to own.

7. Paris corner rifaqaat adorn - very sharp and too masculine. I wouldn't want to smell this on anyone either 

8. Paris corner rifaqaat - I hated it, liked it and hated it again. That spicy vanilla leather isn't for me.

9. Fragrance world suits  - same as rifaqaat adorn 

10. Paris corner Mawj appletini - I don't even know why I picked this. I have so many vanillas so I wanted a fruity freshie for a change. Doesn't smell bad but I wouldn't wear it. Don't particularly love apple brandy on the rocks either.

So, I [M, 22], and i have a GF [F, 22]. She's my first girlfriend. We are both in the same college (education) program and also a graduating student na. We became official last year December po so we're already dating for a year.

Just a brief background po about us, I am a quiet or introverted type of guy, pero maingay to those who I'm close with. And, she is also the same or not? Kasi she's the type of girl na magiging close mo kasi marunong mag approach and nakikisama even to strangers, she just tend to be quiet sometimes. I have many likes and hobbies, such as music, movies, reading, and cooking. While her? Wala po. Though she also love reading, pero sa online po, sa mga fb pages (confessions, stories, etc.)

I met her during our 2nd Year. She's cute, and she's very kind kasi once before when i was buying a coffee and it was full of lurking humans, and as someone na medyo mahiyain pinauuna ko muna matapos bago ako, pero she approached me and told me na isasabay na rin niya yung sakin (she's with her friends that time) even though we're not close and don't have that much interaction except that we were classmates that time. I think that interaction made me like her or she caught my interest. I told my guy friends about it when we were talking about crushes or interest sa section namin. Then, weeks later, parang sinabi nila in a joke sa GC ng class namin na i like her. Kasi my friends want me to be with her kasi interesado raw ako sakanya, so they kept pushing me. Akala ko ayaw niya and she'll felt uncomfortable about it kasi naging ganun yung feeling ko at first, pero to my surprise hindi and parang sumasabay pa siya. Fastforward, we were talking na personally and in chats for months pero it was on and off kasi i was making sure sa feelings ko and her before i told her, then i began courting her last year October and we became official on December. We celebrate our monthsaries eating outside and giving each other gifts, and yun lang. I haven't done it with her kasi we're still in college and I respect her, only kisses and hugs palang. Legal siya sa family ko, pero ako hindi pa since hindi pa pwede sa father niya, yung mother lang yung may alam.

We're okay naman those months, there were just days na nag-aaway kasi I don't like chatting too much kasi madami rin akong gustong gawin. Nagkikita naman kami, and an update is enough for me kasi there is also a reason why. If we're in chat, it will always about her chismis/issues na nangyayari sa kanilang circle of friends or minsan naman sa academics, and family which is okay. I was fine with it at first, pero paulit-ulit lang. I thought it was a waste of time. Hindi rin naman kami makapag-usap personally and chats about hobbies kasi wala naman siyang hilig kahit music sa phone niya wala. I tried recommending her many times my fav. Ghibli movies and other U.S films, K-drama, pero di raw talaga siya mahilig. So when we're together, puro chismis and other pangyayari sa circle of friends nila yung talks namin. She invited me to join them pag may lakad kasi kasama rin daw mga bf ng friends niya. Pero i usually decline it kasi I don't feel comfortable around her circle kasi puro issues and when they resolve a misunderstanding puro social media agad parang di college and mature way to handle it, and I'd rather be with my own circle (our circle of friends are also in the same program with us). No chismises and just drinks and kwentuhan lang when together. She was fine with it kasi she's kind nga and puro friends lang naman kasama ko po. Pero there were days na hindi ako nakakapag-update for a day only, pero I'll inform her about it naman, and if not, then i will tell her my reasons after. This were just days na i don't have the energy to open social media and do nothing but lay down in bed kasi nakakapagod po (i hope you know that feeling).

These past days we're always together naman. She just have those fetish na mahilig sa kuko/fingernail? She likes holding my hands and caressing my fingernails kasi it's beautiful, kahit malaki daw ay parang pang girls kasi soft daw hindi parehas sa iba. Sorry for my words. I was okay with it kasi sinabi niya naman sakin before, pero sometimes it's just too much. Parang it made me lose my confidence a bit kasi parang 'yun nalang yung kino-compliment niya and not the person as as whole. Haha. Was it petty or weird to feel that way? 

If not for our academics talks, i think naghiwalay na kami before. Parang iyon nalang kasi ang bumubuhay every time when we're together. Now, I still like her, pero I can't confidently say na I love her. I want to have a relationship where both of us are comfortable, and can share each other's hobbies, and happiness. I don't like it when a person is more active in chismis than our personal interests. Though she's very kind and caring, I think the spark i felt from her before is fading. I once told her that it's better to break up kasi she deserves someone better, pero at the end of the day we always resolve it.

But now, it's different, I feel like a toxic person whenever i treat her like that. I thought that hobbies or similarities aren't that much important in a relationship, but now, I think it is. Is it wrong for me to look for that kind of love? If i really break-up with her, can you share your thoughts on this matter para hindi po siya masaktan ng sobra.

I apologize po for asking this kind of questions and opinions. I just need your perspectives to this.",1,1734254236.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

For the past few years I‚Äôve always had symptoms of severe dizziness, just from getting up, running, or even just lifting something heavy at work, I never really thought much of it. 

Yesterday after getting up in the morning, i became so dizzy and fuzzy that it felt like my vision just completely disappeared. After coming back from that, all I could see was white wavy lines and I started to feel cold and shaky. My blood pressure sky rocketed to 157/102. This never happened before so I called the care-doc and at first she put my appointment 3 hours away until I told her what I was experiencing, then she pushed it to an hour away. 

I went in, my blood pressure was still high, and my head still felt fuzzy. She said it could be a million things but thinks it‚Äôs either anemia or hypoglycaemia. 

It‚Äôs the next morning now, my head still hurts, and I have blood tests to do on Thursday. 

For diet, I‚Äôve always struggled with food and most days I just eat one meal or multiple small snacks like crisps, and have either an energy drink or a coffee. 

Few years ago after being in a car accident, I got my blood tested and he said my blood sugar was very low for my age (15, now 19) and that I should go check it in a different appointment but I never did ",1,1734254155.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

I am a current resident of Kirkwood (I know its not St. Louis) and my girlfriend who is 18 (both same age) are coming into town. We are looking to explore more into the city, and would like some help coming up with ideas or things to do! We love exploring urban areas, vintage shopping, she likes coffee, saftey is a priority, and so any tips related would be most appreciated. This will not be her first time, but hopefully with suggestions this will be a good visit!

Some ideas I have:

\- Go to St. Louis hills for the Christmas lights then head to Ted Drews

\- Explore neighborhoods near Tower Grove/ any south and safer neighborhood for coffee and shops or just to walk

\- Walk around St. Charles (I know its not St. Louis but I enjoy walking around there)

\- Go to the City Museum (I wonder if our age has stuff to do, well find out if we go!)

So anyway, kagina, may event ang Seventeen Iloilo didto and may tables na reserved. I bought my drink tapos nag sit sa table nga WALA reserved sign, emphasis sa wala.

Then, after a few minutes, this girlie came up to me, I assume nga manager to sya or lapit sa tag-iya kay naka civilian sya kag freely mka move behind the counter. She told me na reserved pala ang table so I told her na okay mn ko mag saylo, ngita'i lng ko seat. Tapos nag libot sya kag nag balik, then she said na wla na daw seats available, okay lng ba na e take out ko ang drink? Diri na nag bagting ulo ko.

Ka disappointing nga first solution mo is to kick out the customer. Wala man lng nag explore other options tani like mag share table or something. Nag ask pa ko sa iya ""sure ka?"" Like amo na lang gid na option mo??

Nag offer mn sya nga kwaan folding table or chair sa likod pero after ko pa e assert right ko kay daw pahalinon ya gd ko. Mayo lng may nag halin sa isa ka table and amo nlg to gn reserve nya.

What did I do the first time? Well I did what anyone else would do, I flew over the earth, morphed objects with my mind, and caused in every definition of the word, chaos. I woke up in my bed after what felt like the most amazing time of my life. I look at the small alarm clock on the bed stand next to my full sized bed with nothing but a singular thin blanket covering me in my studio apartment. Rubbing my eyes after seeing the time on the alarm clock as nothing but a blur I finally read the time, ""8:00am."" ""Time to prepare for work."" I say to myself, reluctantly peeling myself out of bed, my breath nearly visible in the cool room.

I turn on my television and flip to the local news station, on which a story is being covered about how a vehicle spontaneously burst into flames. Not paying much attention to the news as I only use it to measure traffic I'll run into mindlessly driving to work, I make my breakfast, a jimmy dean breakfast sandwich and a large mug of cheap coffee. I drive myself to work without interruption after eating my breakfast and filling a paper cup up with what's left in the coffee maker and make my way inside the towering building where, 5 days a week, I sit at a desk and mindlessly assist everyday people with the accounts they hold with us.

Halfway through my workday my cubicle neighbor poked his head around the corner of the dividing walls to ask me a question, ""Hey man, did you hear about that car the caught on fire this morning?"" ""Yeah briefly, I didn't pay much attention to it though."" I replied. He then said something that chilled me to my bone, ""They're saying it was a red SUV and that the mechanics at the owners insurance company can't find what caused the fire."" My skin went flush and my mouth went dry as his mouth uttered the words, ""red SUV."" for a few seconds my mind raced with thoughts to myself, ""I was causing explosions in my dream. I blew up a red SUV. They can't be related can they? No, there's no way, that was just a dream, this is reality."" My coworker noticed the change in my demeanor and asked me, ""are you ok?"" "" ""yeah, I'm fine, it's nothing. that's a bit terrifying though, just having a car catch fire for seemingly no reason."" I replied.

My coworker and I got back to work after the brief conversation we had and the workday came to an end quickly while my mind still reeled over the odd relation between my dream and reality. Finding myself at home still obsessing over the consistency between my dream and reality, I showered, at my dinner, watched some television, and laid down still questioning my sanity.

Three weeks later:

I'm not sure what to do anymore, every night since my first lucid dream I've dreamt lucidly. The first week was sunshine and rainbows, pushing the limits with my lucid dreams and experimenting with what I could and could not accomplish in my dreams, but now my dreams are filled with terror. I think it was midway through the second week when I noticed it, only in the corner of my eye, I saw a dark figure looming just out of my full vision during my dreams. The only thing I've been able to make out from my partial sight of this... this creature, is the sinister smile it has plastered on its face throughout my dreams. The crooked sharp, and yellow stained teeth shown through an evil grin painted permanently across the face of the creature would give even the most resilient minds nightmares, but for me, I'm watching the nightmare, aren't I?

The first week noticing the presence it seemed as though it was observing me, but as of the last few days, it has been causing mayhem. Disasters, explosions, or people dying in grotesque ways without me willing it to happen constantly, I can only assume the entity that obsesses my thoughts is responsible for the maniacal happenings in my lucid dreams. I've come to realize that the events in my dreams bleed into reality, whether it be a car catching fire, or a group of random people in a locked room beaten beyond recognition with no knowledge of how it came to be. The first instance of the entity causing harm in my dream was when it brought down a building. I cried out in terror for the event to stop but I had no control over the situation while the entity forced past my mental will like a tank firing through a brick wall.

The morning I woke from this dream I watched the news with my full attention, ""Planted bomb kills 35 people in the empire state building, 20 injured and receiving medical care at the local hospital."" the words of the host rang through my ears, digging into my skull like sharp knives while I felt last night's dinner toy with my throat. My body, too stiff to move, was suddenly awoken by my phone's ringtone, ""Mom"" is what my phone read. I answered the phone, my mother frantically, ""are you ok? you weren't in that explosion were you?"" She asked, her words spewing out so fast I had to take a moment to understand what she said, ""I'm fine, I was home when it happened. You don't have to worry."" I reassured my mother. We had a brief conversation and then said our goodbyes, I went to work and could barely keep my head straight at my desk, my coworkers could sense my demeanor of helplessness for the day.

I went home dreading falling asleep just to have another dream ending in the death of so many innocent lives, so I kept making coffee, forcing myself awake until 4 days later, I got lazy and allowed myself the luxury of sleep. I become lucid, my dream taking place in a foreign country, the dark figure haunting me just out of my vision. Suddenly, the ground began to rumble, at first it was tame, but it gradually began to feel like the ground was moving like the harsh waves of the ocean. I look around me, buildings falling, the screams of people doomed to the merciless and unempathetic disaster that an earthquake is known for sting my ears. A building comes hurling towards me, I wake up, it's 7:00am, I open the news. ""Magnitude 8.5 earthquake devastates Japan."" After hearing those words, my ears went rang with a deafening tone.

One month later:

I hadn't slept in 172 hours, the full appearance of an entity described only as pure evil terrorizing my mind, driving me to accept the insanity that is sleep depravation rather than allowing it dominance over my lucid dreamscape. Eight days earlier the entity revealed its full appearance to me in the most, gruesome, merciless, and catastrophic dream I've experienced to this day. The entity shown itself in full, its inhumanly wide smile revealing its crooked, blood stained teeth, glistening in the light of my dream. Its eyes, oh God its eyes, jet black and with a sinister look of enjoyment as the latest disaster it cause reflected off of its black holes for eyes. It wore a cloak that seemed to bind to its anatomy, covering its head and flowing down into long swirling, almost tentacle like appendages, some of the appendages flowing and whipping in the wind while others tensed and twitched in what appeared to be excitement like a giddy kid on Christmas morning. It let out a laugh as it willed the continent of Africa deep into the earth, quickly being swallowed into the maw that is the oceans jaws. Its laugh echoed and reverberated through my dream and rang in my mind similar to standing next to a large bell as it signaled the ending of a Sunday mass, although this was a sound only possible to be conceived in hell.

Waking from this dream, I already knew what happened, a completely unexpected, seemingly paranormal instance of an entire continent being swallowed up by the earth and covered in the sapphire blue oceans that surrounded what used to be Africa. Turning the news on that morning, the entire world risen in panic, a collective and planetary shared feeling of terror that united every human into solving the mysterious and sudden catastrophic events that threatened the lives of every living soul on the earth made my stomach feel like a boulder. I pressed the power button on the television remote, powering the TV off and placing my head in my hands, unsure of how to possibly prevent the disasters from occurring.

A lightbulb went off in my mind, many people have fought off sleep with the use of hard drugs, I then formed in my head a mission to find someone to sell me amphetamines, hopefully as much as I could get my hands on. Surely I thought that an amphetamine induced psychosis was a more than necessary self sacrifice over letting millions of humans die in a night, but what never crossed my mind, was hallucinating the entity in reality. I spent most of my time with my eyes glued shut like a child hiding from the shadows in the dark, the only time I opened my sore and swollen eyelids is to fish for and load the pipe that facilitates my constant race against the body's need and aching desire for sweet, restful sleep, and then, the worst possible thing happened.

I woke up several days later, nearly the entire earth in ruins, I hadn't anticipated overdosing and losing consciousness. The punch line must be that I didn't die from the overdose but fought against death as the entity wreaked havoc through my delirious, lucid dream. I saw the entity do more unspeakable things on those days of sleep, things more heartless and cruel than forcing the oceans to swallow Africa. The first disaster caused humanity to scream so loud that I'm sure you could've heard it from the moon. Suddenly, I see the skies of multiple continents light up as it began to rain droplets of fire down onto the poor, suffering people, the only survivors being those in inflammable shelters. I can only imagine the mental scarring the survivors suffered as they peered out of the windows while the rest of humanity were used as tinder to fuel the entities sick and twisted idea of fun.

The following disaster took place on my last day of slumber, the sight of which twisted my stomach in knots while simultaneously sinking my heart below my feet. Giant snake like creatures slithered out of the depths of the earth, crushing skyscrapers in their path and devouring any living and breathing creature that dared to exist within their field of view. After seeing the earth in ruins, I was much more careful with my intake of amphetamines, only partaking on the brink of exhaustion, and never doing more than I needed out of panic, which was the mistake I made last time.

Fifteen days later:

Well, this is it, my last account of what happened, my mind torn into pieces, doubting I'll every recover from the terror that was forced on me. I lasted two weeks without sleep, preventing the doom of humanity, suffering hallucinations, psychosis, and physical repercussions from being spun out. Finally it came, the pure, endless black that only the beginning phase of sleep can show. I find myself lucid, seeing the entity I wish I could forget entirely, a devilish grin on its face like always, blood dripping down its chin as it stared at me, no, into me, causing my soul to feel like a chunk of dry ice trapped inside me. I watch, no control over the events that I know will follow my loss of consciousness.

The entity raises a hand, a long, skeletal like arm with grey skin stretching over its bones, long pointed, claw like nails protruding from its fingers. Its hand was pointed directly at the moon, its inhuman smile growing even wider as it thrusts its hand downwards towards the earth. The moon began to close in on the earth, tides obvious from the sky to increase in height as the moon's gravity has an increased effect as it moves steadily towards the earth. With the last of my mental fortitude I try to hold the moon at a standstill, I'm successful for a short time, but it seemed to give even more joy to the entity as I saw it twitch gleefully while it observed my quickly dwindling strength, eventually letting out a shrill laugh as my strength left completely. I was forced to watch as the moon crashed into the earth, shattering the crust like glass, throwing magma out in every direction, the oceans evaporating before my eyes. Flames and explosions engulfed the earth when the entity spoke to me for the first time, ""It's time for you to wake up from your nightmare.""

I wake up drenched in sweat, and confused as I take in my surroundings. A tube is stuffed into my throat, acting in proxy to my lungs, several IV bags hanging and forcing liquids into me. Doctors flood the room as I look around, they begin removing the tube down my throat as a choke on my own breath, I try to speak, asking, ""Where am I? What's going on?"" My voice too hoars to be understandable. One of the doctors look at me and says, ""rest your voice for now, you've been unconscious for quite a while vice captain.""

Vice captain? I ask myself within my own head before the doctor speaks again, ""Let me refresh your memory. You were abducted by an alien race we call 'the harbingers' you were on the brink of death and we had no choice but to put you into a medically induced coma until your mind was free of their telepathic powers."" I was sent reeling, my mind broken into pieces remembering a life I never truly lived according to the doctor, while vague memories of my real life slowly replaced the false life that I had lived for thirty plus years. The doctor spoke again, ""As for where you are right now, you are aboard space vessel E-216, also known as, 'The Archangel.' We are currently orbiting the nearest habitable planet to your rescue coordinates known as X-686, and as for you sir, you are the vice captain of this vessel.""",1,1734253109.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

moment. How to exist. How to understand that I cannot control life, that I can only experience it in both its light and its dark stages. I am slowly learning how to laugh and cry and feel through it all, how to welcome the confusion and the joy that comes with loving and living. and breaking. I am slowly learning how to accept where I am. I am slowly learning learning how to simply believe in the person I am becoming.

But he's always there to help us out of the little jams too.""

I saw Tom perform at the Chicago Theatre on that tour, and that ""little jams"" line was the culmination to a significantly longer anecdote. My memory of it is spotty at best, but it had to do with someone struggling to open a small plastic container of jelly that came with their meal. Ultimately the package is sliced open by a crucifix pendant or some other religious accoutrement. Thus the ""he's always there to help us out of the little jams"" zinger. The sort of shaggy dog story Tom has been telling since the bit about the veal cutlet beating the shit out of his cup of coffee. My memory is that the anecdote went on for quite a while, with Waits maintaining the preacher persona throughout while the band vamped as they do on the *Big Time* recording. I assume the bit was edited down on the live album because he couldn't justify using 25% of an LP side's runtime to build up to a dad joke.

Anyway, he clearly told the same story (or a variation of it) during the shows that were recorded for *Big Time*, and my guess is he deployed that bit regularly on that tour. I'm wondering if any recordings of the complete joke are out there somewhere. Does anyone know of any bootlegs with the full jam (pun fully intended)?",6,1734252349.0,tomwaits,0,1.0,False

These are all bags that I was able to brew and finish. Last pic is for current set of beans that I am going through. Will also be including some descriptions that are purely my opinion. 

Disclaimers: I brew filter only: V60, Origami, Aeropress, and Ceado Hoop. I only drink coffee hot. I only drink coffee plain black. Grinders I have are Fellow Opus and Timemore c2



Must try tier: beans that I really liked and would 100% buy again

1. Mecca (Sydney) Efrain Armando Guerrero Paz - favorite beans from the list. Super funky and playful experience with a nice juicy finish
2. Franken (Marikina) Finca Los Angeles Colombia Geisha - favorite locally roasted beans. Tastes like sweet lemonade with excellent clarity
3. Mecca (Sydney) Carlos Guamanga - very bright tasting. Sometimes too bright and overwhelming in the tongue. Also produces a lot of fines. The taste is still super duper good though
4. Plain Sight (Mandaluyong) Tianjiao Pu‚Äôer - honestly the most unique beans I have ever tried. Very fragrant before and after brewing. It doesn‚Äôt smell like coffee at all lol. Tastes like Dark Skittles
5. Good cup (Cebu) Hulia Reserve - clean tea like finish. Very light bodied. No none-sense experience. Just a consistently good cup all the time


Good tier: beans that I liked and worth the blind buy

1. Code Black Coffee (Melbourne) Seasonal Blend (Ethiopia + Colombia + Colombia) - only espresso roast that I ended up liking. Very fragrant and sweet, and surprisingly capable for filter brews. 
2. Franken (Marikina) Finca San Carlos Mountain Water Decaf - Only medium-light roasted decaf beans I have ever tried. Everyone else roasts dark lol. Tastes like orange zesto with a spicy aftertaste (not kidding, spicy)
3. Kurasu (Kyoto) Kenya Muthingi AA - floral tasting with a tea finish. Produced way too many chaffs though that affected drawdown times far too often
4. Plain Sight (Mandaluyong) Kenya Gachatha AA - tastes nothing like the tasting notes indicated on the packaging lol. Still good though. Juicy tasting beans that has a balanced body and acidity.
5. Candid (Quezon city) Honey Cereal - honestly very surprised I liked it considering how I will roast (pun very intended) rest of Candid beans later on in this post. A surprisingly good tasting blend. Fruity and whole bodied but still has a nice acidity to it. 


Meh tier: ehhhh. Will try once, will probably never repeat

1. Skittle Lane (Sydney) Central Kenya - roasted too dark for filter beans and produced way too many fines. Finished the whole bag without being able to dial in the best tasting version. Green grape wine flavor
2. Plain Sight (Mandaluyong) Sitio Belis - roasted unevenly and honestly tastes wrong. Funky tasting, but the wrong kind. Only saving grace is that it has good sweetness when brewed with the Aeropress
3. St. Ali (Melbourne) Orthodox blend - honestly doing this a bit of injustice since it‚Äôs an espresso roasted beans and this is supposedly a filter beans only list. Tastes meh for filter coffee but honestly very good for cold brew and espresso (the few times I drink those). Rich chocolatey flavor without any bitterness
4. Plain Sight (Mandaluyong) Trooper Blend - Meh. Literally the most Meh tasting coffee out there. Tastes like brown sugar
5. Blue Bottle (roasted in Tokyo) Decaf blend - roasted way too dark. Tastes very bitter. Good body, but can‚Äôt taste any other notes due to the bitter aftertaste.


Do not try tier: basically forced myself to finish the bags

1. Plain Sight (Mandaluyong) Dayglow blend - tastes horrible for filter coffee. Drinkable for cold brew. Did not taste any of the tasting notes in the packaging 
2. Round Boy Roasters (Singapore) Ethiopia and Guatamela - I feel like I got a bad batch of roasting from Round Boy as I‚Äôve had great tasting beans from them before. There‚Äôs a distinct bitter flavor and aroma for these 2 beans that made any cup from it very astringent and hard to distinguish the flavor. 
3. Padre coffee (Melbourne) Lucky Boy blend - I know it‚Äôs espresso roast, but it‚Äôs too bland. Can‚Äôt taste any notes at all. It‚Äôs like a generic grocery coffee
4. Candid (Quezon city) Brazil Cerrado, S‚Äômores, Black Forest, and Deathwish - all are roasted way too dark reaching Starbucks level burnt: charcoal af and as black as they come lol. It is unsurprisingly too bitter to taste any tasting notes. Can forgive if it wasn‚Äôt marketed as ‚Äúomni roast‚Äù but it is, and honestly a waste of money if you will not use this for espresso. 


Bonus: in the current rotation and just providing initial thoughts

1. Nylon (Singapore) Nano Challa Ethiopia - tea like and very floral so far
2. Plain Sight (Vista Hermosa) - very fragrant and excellent for aeropress/ceado hoop
3. Haven‚Äôt opened the 2 beans from Lucent (Tokyo)",1,1734252272.0,CoffeePH,1,1.0,False

My house just swallows things and it‚Äôs not just me. Sometimes I‚Äôm like am I shifting between diff realities and this stuff just never existed in this one in the first place? It‚Äôs not like things go missing outside of my house it‚Äôs solely just in my house. It also doesn‚Äôt happen to just me. My friend moved in with me back in October (so there is me, my friend and my partner in a 3 bed house) and she also constantly has things just go missing. We‚Äôre all so baffled by it!!

We don‚Äôt leave important things on the coffee table / in the front room in general as this seems to be the place items are last seen before they disappear forever. 

Note that most stuff that goes missing is pretty benign. Talking like clothing items / accessories. I think the weirdest case was we bought some üçÑ for our friends and the guy gave us extra for free so we had the extra stuff on the coffee table. My partners friend (not the one who was buying üçÑ) came round and he explicitly remembers seeing it on the coffee table. I remember seeing it on the tv stand because I moved it off the coffee table so we could play monopoly lol. Once we were done with monopoly and clearing up I was like oh we should weigh the üçÑ and put them away safe. Could they be found anywhere? No. The 3 of us searched high and low checking every nook and cranny. My partners friend even checked the bin because we were all SO confused where it could have gone to. It‚Äôs been about 6 months and we all laugh about how they just disappeared in the space of a couple of hours when we were actually present. 

I had a big set of house keys, I came in tipsy after a work event put them on the coffee table with my bag and I couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere the next morning. My friend checked the whole house when she lost something a couple months later and never found my set of keys she is confident they could not be anywhere in the house, but I had to use them to get into the house.

IBS and Crohn‚Äôs runs in my family. Over the past year, mostly since the summer, I‚Äôve lost a drastic amount of weight due to being unable to eat. My loved ones have commented and are worries, because I‚Äôve had an eating disorder in the past and they don‚Äôt want a relapse. Things I could eat just a year ago have been cause me incredible amounts of abdominal pain, to the point of almost passing out in the bathroom. It‚Äôs been such a quick, drastic change that I‚Äôm lost.

I discovered I‚Äôm gluten-intolerant despite not being celiac, so the pain has gotten a lot better and not constantly almost fainting multiple times a day, but it still hurts like hell. I‚Äôve cut out gluten, dairy, coffee/espresso, takeaway, fatty/oily foods, raw vegetables and raw fruits with peels, just to see if those things are triggering. I‚Äôm not getting any nutrition. No matter what I eat, even small portions, I experience extreme discomfort if not outright pain, especially when I need to go to the bathroom. It‚Äôs to the point that I don‚Äôt eat much of anything to avoid the pain. My anxiety has gotten so much worse, which is likely contributing to the issue, because I can‚Äôt trust anything I eat.

I often wake up at the same time every night having to go to the bathroom. I get night sweats, nausea, bloating, gas. The only relief I get from pain is when I don‚Äôt eat, and that‚Äôs a whole other issue in itself.

I have a doctor‚Äôs appointment on Tuesday and I‚Äôm hoping to ask about diverticulitis or gastroparesis and get some form of testing. I‚Äôve already had bloodwork and stool tests that show nothing aside from my thyroid levels being elevated. I‚Äôve had subclinical hypothyroidism but it fixed itself without medication but I‚Äôm guessing malnutrition has completely fucked it.

1heobue,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1heobue/leaving_my_alcoholic_wife/,Leaving My Alcoholic Wife?,"We've been struggling with my wife alcoholism for 13 years. We also have an 8 year old daughter. When she got pregnant with our daughter it was one magical period where she didn't drink at all (except only one time after around 5 months in pregnancy - 1-2 bottles). Daughter was born very healthy. 

She's not the type of alcoholic who drinks everyday. But she binges. 3 weeks or 3 months can pass without her drinking, and suddenly boom. It can be very random when it happens, (may be triggered by something negative that her neighbour said to her that day, or an argument with me, or menstrual cycle, or drinking too much coffee in the morning, etc). Wife's mother also died of alcoholism, so it's in her family.

When she gets drunk, everytime she gets really violent and abusive towards me (I'm always the target because our daughter she sees her as perfect so she doesn't go to her), but towards me verbally and many times physically violent too. A drunk episode can last between 2 days to 5 days of nightmare. She terrorizes me around the house, screaming, throws things and break objects, hitting me (I'm a man so I can block most of her punches) one time I ran and hide in a neighbours house, she took a cleaver and chopped a tree in front of our house while screaming abusive words.

A few years back we lost our gold (rings, necklace, earrings) because during a period of time I didn't give her money at all and her addiction kicked in, she went to a pawn shop and sold those things for money for alcohol. Beer, not even liquor (she doesn't like liquor) 2-3 big bottles of beer enough to send her to insanity :(

Recently as she is growing up, I can see that our daughter gets very emotionally hurt more and more, because she starts to confront her mom. And this is when I start to think that we really won't be able to survive as a family.

Over the years we tried many things, found a good doctor (psychiatrist) who cares and have been in his care for at least 6 years. She has been prescribed meds, including antabuse-for around 3 years which worked but we had to stop due to her nerve damage on her toes and tinnitus side effect. For the past 9 months she's back without antabuse and since 6 months ago she's been in AA, but still she can't stop drinking. Asked my parents to help, they talked to her tried bringing her to church, and in the end I gave her ultimatum and she still failed to stop drinking.

I told her I'm getting a divorce, the previous time it happened I got phsyically sick with fever, I said I've reached my limit and she keeps begging and begging me to give her another chance and she will stop drinking for sure (heard this too many times already). I'm planning to divorce her and bring my daughter along with me, seems to be the most logical choice for the health and future for the two of us.

However now I have a heavy heart and guilt, what if wife will continue to decline and die without me. But some people have mentioned as well to me that this is actually what my wife needs in order for her to turn her life around and stop drinking, she needs to face her own monster without me cushioning her fall and enabling her?

It's the most important decision in my life. What do you think? I will tremendously appreciate any reply and point of view. Thank you so much in advance..",6,1734251229.0,alcoholism,5,0.88,False

I recently took a Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I need to share this incredible experience with you all. It was honestly one of the best day trips I've ever taken, and I think you'll want to hear about it.

I was initially hesitant about spending 14 hours on a bus tour, but trust me, it was totally worth it. The journey itself was surprisingly comfortable - we had this nice air-conditioned bus with a bathroom (which came in handy during the long ride), and our guide was absolutely fantastic. He kept us entertained with interesting facts about the area and made sure everyone was comfortable throughout the trip.

The tour picked us up right from our hotel in Vegas (huge plus - no need to figure out transportation early in the morning), and we made our first stop in Kingman, Arizona. It was a perfect chance to grab some coffee and stretch our legs.

But the real magic happened when we reached the South Rim. Guys, pictures don't do this place justice. When you first stand at Mather Point and look out over that vast canyon... it's breathtaking. The colors, the scale, the way the light plays on the rocks - it's unlike anything else I've ever seen.

We visited multiple viewpoints along the rim, including Bright Angel Point, and each one offered a completely different perspective. The great thing about this tour is that you get enough time at each stop to really take it all in and snap plenty of photos.

They included a meal voucher with the tour (the food was actually pretty decent), and we also had time to check out the National Geographic Visitor Center, which was really informative.

Here's what I think makes this tour special - for $80, you're getting incredible value. Everything's taken care of - transportation, guide, food, and entry fees. But if you want to make it even more epic, you can add some cool upgrades. I splurged on the helicopter ride (25 minutes of pure awe), but they also offer an IMAX experience and a Hummer tour along the rim.

If you're planning to do this tour (which you absolutely should), I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim - they were super professional and everything went smoothly.

Quick tip: Bring layers! The rim can be way cooler than Vegas, and the weather can change quickly. Also, don't forget your camera - you'll want to capture every moment.

Has anyone else done this tour? Would love to hear about your experiences in the comments!

He sits in his office chair, the ergonomic kind that‚Äôs supposed to be good for his back. His spine doesn‚Äôt agree. Ankylosing Spondylitis - the doctors said his bones were fusing together, slowly turning him into a human sculpture. He stretches, winces, and goes back to staring at the document on his screen. A deadline looms. There‚Äôs always a deadline.

The phone buzzes on the table. It‚Äôs his mom‚Äôs message on WhatsApp. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the way they talk about you.‚Äù He has left all the family WhatsApp groups after the divorce to make it easier for the uncles and the aunties to gossip about him. The same aunties and uncles, the same tired refrain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder she left him. Four years and no kids!‚Äù Must be impotent - being the underlying message. As if the hours he spent hunched over his laptop, clawing his way from a nobody to a somebody, meant nothing. As if the sacrifices he made were invisible, even to her.

He pours another cup of chai. His hands shake as he stirs it. It‚Äôs the exhaustion. The kind that wraps around your chest like a rope, pulling tighter with every breath. He used to drink coffee, the kind she made him every morning. But he gave that up somewhere along the line, along with everything else that wasn‚Äôt work.

When he met her, he was 22, broke, and full of dreams too big for his wallet. She wanted a house in Bangalore‚Äîa place of their own in a city where the rent bled you dry before you even unpacked. She had big dreams too, but they were practical. Dreams with numbers attached. And she was almost blind, her eyesight hanging by a thread. He thought about that a lot. About what would happen to her if he wasn‚Äôt there, if he didn‚Äôt build something solid before his body gave out.

So he worked. He wrote. And he got good at it‚Äîreally good. From 15k to 50k to 7 figures in just under four years. He was the guy people called when they needed words that could sell anything. The guy who turned sentences into money, who made the impossible seem attainable with a well-placed metaphor.

But with every pay raise, he got a little crazier about work. He told himself it was for her, for them. He imagined the house they‚Äôd buy, the vacations they‚Äôd take, the safety net he was building brick by brick. He wanted to give her everything she deserved, but in the process, he gave her nothing she needed.

The long nights at his desk turned into longer weeks away. The deadlines piled up, and so did the silences. He thought she understood. She said she did, at first. But eventually, her patience wore thin. She told him she felt abandoned. That he was in the room but never really there. He nodded, promised to do better, then went right back to his laptop.

When her father landed in the ICU, she begged him to come. He wanted to, but there was a campaign launch the next morning. A big one. He told himself he‚Äôd make it up to her later. That she‚Äôd understand why he had to stay. But later never came.

She signed the papers a few months after that. He didn‚Äôt fight her. What would have been the point? She‚Äôd already spent years fighting for him to notice her, to choose her over his work, and he‚Äôd failed every single time.

Now, he lives in a sterile apartment with no photos on the walls and no coffee on the stove. The house in Bangalore? He could buy it now, cash down, but what would be the point? The dream had always included her. Without her, it was just bricks and mortar.

The phone buzzes again. Mom again, she has been tired of defending him against the endless stream of whispers. She tells me that she says he is a hard worker, a good son, that the divorce was mutual. She doesn‚Äôt say impotent, but he knows that‚Äôs the subtext. In their world, no man who works 16-hour days and still loses his wife can possibly be whole.

He closes the chat. The words sting, but not as much as the memory of her voice on the phone, trembling as she told him she couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. Not as much as the empty side of the bed he still wakes up to every morning.

The work is still there, waiting. It‚Äôs the only thing that hasn‚Äôt left him. He rolls up his sleeves and gets back to it, typing until his fingers ache. He tells himself he‚Äôs writing for her. That the next paycheck will make her proud, wherever she is.

But deep down, he knows he‚Äôs just writing to fill the silence. To keep from hearing her say goodbye, over and over again.",30,1734251097.0,RelationshipIndia,18,0.92,False

1heo6zz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1heo6zz,Need help merging/blending picture of deceased sister,"It's Christmas coming up & I'm really tight on money. My sister & I decided to have a little Christmas celebration together since we're the only family we have. We also agreed to exchange gifts, so I was hoping I could give her something unique she'd really cherish..a picture of me, her, and our oldest sister that passed away from cancer a few years ago. My sisters were literally best friends, and the loss of my oldest sister devastated us. We still haven't accepted her absence. I wanted to give something more meaningful than a coffee mug or robe this Christmas. 

If possible, could anyone please take these 2 pictures and somehow merge and blend them to look like it was 1 photo? I plan to use some kind of effect to make it look like it was drawn or water colored..Kind of like that website where they are able to draw your loved one. Not sure how Im gonna do that, either..but 1 step at a time, I suppose.

I'd really like for it to look like my sister and I are kissing both sides of my late sisters cheeks, if possible. And have the bottom hair and backgrounds blended or removed, as well as removing the man I'm smoochin' on, that's also appreciated üòÖ Thank you so much in advance to anyone who's willing and able to help üíñ

The new con has resulted in approximately Dh3.5 million being swindled from these individuals, who were lured by individuals impersonating court and law enforcement officials.

Initially, the BlueChip Group promised investors impressive returns of three percent monthly on at least $10,000, with their investments locked in for 18 months. The scheme gained additional credibility through endorsements from Bollywood actor Sonu Sood, leading many investors to feel secure in their financial decisions.

The unraveling of the BlueChip scam began in March 2024 when payments ceased. Investors were left holding bounced checks and receiving zero communication from the company. With overall losses estimated to surpass $100 million, this has turned into one of the largest financial frauds to hit the region.

Fast forward to July 2024, a gathering of 15 victims took place in a hotel conference room in Deira, where they were promised a chance for justice. They were misled into visiting Dubai Courts to sign an e-document for a supposed payout order. After being taken to a nearby coffee shop, a woman collected their signatures under questionable pretenses.

As the news spread through WhatsApp groups, additional victims of the BlueChip scam became involved, anxious to claim compensation for their losses. They were misled into thinking they could recover their investments with the payment of an extra 7.5% fee on their initial amounts. Some, like Preity and her husband, even went to extreme lengths, such as closing a long-held joint bank account and pawning personal items to raise necessary funds.

The deceit deepened with the creation of a second WhatsApp group promising an additional Dh230 million in BlueChip assets. Victims remained hopeful despite growing red flags. By late September, Preity had transferred considerable funds, including a Dh3.5 million blank cheque, all under the guise of fulfilling procedural requirements imposed by the supposed recovery officers.

As time went on, additional demands surfaced, with deadlines continuously pushed back and further fees required. Many victims came to the alarming realization that they were ensnared in a second trap, but not before substantial amounts were lost to Preity and her introduced accomplices, including someone posing as an Interpol officer.

Currently, the hunt continues for the owner of the BlueChip Group, Ravindra Nath Soni, who remains elusive despite an arrest warrant. The courts have issued an order for him to pay Dh10.05 million to a specific applicant or face severe legal repercussions.

This ongoing saga highlights the vulnerabilities faced by those pursuing justice and the importance of remaining vigilant against elaborate deceit.
