1humf3p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1humf3p,"Grind level, and water flow","How much of a difference does grind coarseness make in the brewing process? I've read coarse ground is best. For a while I was grinding with a bsisc coffee grinder and just eye balling what I considered coarse. I recently bought a grinder with coarseness settings, and on coarse the grind seems more fine to me. I thought, hmm maybe I have no idea what coarse is and have basically been brewing coffee rocks until now.

Trying to pour my watter through takes for ever because it seems there is not good water flow through the coffee as I can only pour a few table spoons of water at a time! 

Photo for reference of the grinders course and fine setting and the pitcher I am using to brew.

1humdf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1humdf2/best_machine/,Best Machine?,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice here! I’m opening an indoor sports facility, and as part of the experience, I want to include a lounge area with free coffee for customers. I’m investing in high-quality beans and want to pair them with the best possible coffee machine within my budget of ~$10k (I can stretch a little if needed).

I’ve been looking at machines like the Jura Giga 10, but I’ve read mixed reviews about reliability. The Jura Giga 6 seems like a solid option too, but it doesn’t have a cold brew feature, which I think would be nice to have. I also came across Miele CM 7750, Eversys Cameo, and Rocket Espresso machines, but I’m completely lost on what would be the best fit for a facility like mine.

Here’s what I’m looking for:
	•	A fully automatic machine (ease of use is key).
	•	The ability to make a wide variety of drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino, hot chocolate, and hopefully cold brew).
	•	High reliability and durability for frequent use.
	•	Easy to clean and maintain.
	•	Something that makes the coffee experience memorable and luxurious for my customers.

Does anyone have experience with these brands or know of other machines that might fit the bill? Any suggestions or guidance would be super helpful because I’m overwhelmed with options. I really want to make sure my customers get a fantastic coffee experience at the lounge!

Thanks in advance for your advice!",1,1736124393.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

1humcg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FartFetishExperiences/comments/1humcg6/fart_experience_my_human_fart_mattress/,FART EXPERIENCE! My Human Fart Mattress 😈,"God, I’ve been so busy with everything I haven’t had time for a session in like two days!! 😡 So last night I decided to use my slave as a body pillow. I needed to feel him pressed against me all night! Even if he squirmed and whined ALL night long! 😍



It’s been so cold here, we just put our thick flannel sheets and a down comforter on the bed! So I made him get under the covers, completely! It’s too bad I chose now to squeeze his face between my thighs all night! Oh well! 😈



I got comfy and made sure his nose was right up against my stinky little farthole. I haven’t had time to even shower in days, so I knew how rank it was. I could even smell myself through the covers!! ☺️



I bundled all up and started to drift off, moaning happily as his whimpers and sobs lulled me to sleep, vibrating my stinky little pockets! His attempts to escape felt like I was being gently rocked to sleep! 🤤 



Suddenly I felt my tummy gurgle and shift, and I giggled sleepily as I pushed out. His poor little nose flattened against my extruding shit cannon, and he was no match as my spongy, rancid wrinkles enveloped his sniffer holes. I also made sure he was wedged tight, so his mouth would be pinned shut against my dripping pussy.



“Sniff sniff, slave! I want deep sniffs all night long. Don’t you dare move your nose away from my butthole at all or you’ll be super fucking sorry!”



He yelped as a steaming hot fart torpedo sizzled out of my swampy ass and straight up his nose! I felt his whole body flinch under me as he took in the overpowering reek and began instantly choking and coughing into my ripe, sweaty twat.



“Shut up! I’m trying to sleep, loser!” I barked in a whiny, sleepy voice. I reached down and grabbed a handful of his hair, yanking him ferociously into my unforgiving stink pit and squashing his face tighter with my beefy thighs. He immediately went limp and let out a horrified squeal, as I kept squeezing him.



I moaned out happily, “Mmmm… big sniffs baby… your nose stays glued to my asshole all night…” I interrupted myself with another long, burbly fart that fluttered and spat straight into his tortured sinus ways. I giggled quietly as he choked it down, sniffing in agony. “Good boy. Keep it up… or else…” 



I drifted to sleep, farting many more times, and then the next thing I knew, it was morning. And I was aching. And my slave was gone…



WHAT THE FUCK?!  😡😡



Now I can be cranky in the morning before my coffee. And this was one of those mornings. I rolled around in the bed until I kicked him in the face. I guess accidentally, but he definitely deserved it!



I groaned and rubbed my eyes, croaking out, “Slave! Where the fuck are you?!” He stirred, and quickly realized his fuck up.



“Baby I’m so sorry! I only moved for a minute and I guess I fell asleep!!” He explained desperately. He tried to continue but I cut him off harshly, “And why did you even move in the first place?!”



He gulped loudly in the dark room. “I’m sorry… you were farting… they were sooo awful… I thought I was going to puke and I couldn’t even breathe under the covers!”



I groaned angrily and huffed, “It’s not my job to care, bitch. You broke the rules. Now get on your fucking back.” My words were calm and cold. He whimpered and hesitated. I commanded loudly, “NOW!!!” And snapped my fingers before pointing to the head of the bed.



He quickly crawled into place and I wasted no time handcuffing his wrists and ankles. I explained in a frustrated tone, “Apparently you can’t be trusted, so this will ensure there is no escape for you.” I tightened the straps and watched him try to writhe against his restraints.



I bit my lip and smiled at his helplessness. “Get ready for hell, bitch!” I warned as I pounced hard on his face and slammed my ass down. He winced and let out a gasp, and then immediately balked on the reeking stink oozing from my crack!



I cackled as I hovered above him, reached back and spread my sticky ass cheeks, and slammed myself down at max weight directly on his nose. Fuck! I felt it flatten and slide into my swampy, itchy fart hole. Sooo good!! I let out a loud moan and started scraping his nostrils back and forth to itch my swollen hole. I guess he was right about those farts, because I could already tell why they were sooo nasty… 😏 



Before he could fully recover, I grunted hard and let loose a horrendous, splattering shart that surprised us both! He literally puked into his mouth as I noticed his stomach heaving and sat heavy on his face again. “Don’t you dare, fuck face. Just take it and keep it down! This is your job!”



I wiggled around and cringed as I felt how much wet fart soup was being smeared all over his flaring nostrils. I giggled out in a disgusted, bratty tone, “Eww that sounded really nasty! And wet! Sorrrrry baaaaabbbby!!!” I sang out my taunt in a cruel, mocking song as he fought wave after wave of puke.



The smell was insane. Burning hot shit, spoiled milk, and rotten vegetables, all amplified by ten and made worse by the unbelievable stinky of my raw asscrack, even before my sharts!!



He wailed miserably as he thrashed against his straps. Nope! Locked down, dumbass! This will teach you not to disobey the princess!!



I lifted up again and laughed out loud at the disgusting sludgy sound of his snorting nostrils, desperately trying to force the toxic goo through so he could breathe again. I didn’t let up on his mouth AT ALL as I savored his agony and imagined it working down inch by inch, driving him insane!



“Snort it and suffer!! Your punishment hasn’t even begun, baby. You better pace yourself. All this thrashing… you’ll end up hurting yourself!” I teased out viciously as my words sank in.



“Now, first things first. I have to pee. Bad. And you know how my morning pees are. So I hope you’re very, very thirsty! It doesn’t matter either way though. Now open up!”



I wiggled around on his mouth until his lips were forced open and my mound dropped down. I sat back heavier and made sure I was aiming for the back of his throat! And poor boy, this just made my drill his nose even deeper into my shart-frosted shithole! 😇



He was absolutely panicked at this point. He managed to turn his head just enough to desperately scream out, “HALEY PLEASE!! YOU’RE LITERALLY SHITTING AND I CAN’T BREATHE AND IT SMELL SOOO BAD!!! I’M SO SORRY I DIDN’T MEAN TO-“



I rolled my eyes and huffed loudly as I reached down and grabbed his chin, gripping it firmly and yanking his head back upright. I slammed myself down on his panting face, cutting him off. “I don’t fucking care! You’re the slave. You obey the Princess. You fucked up. And now you get punished.” I explained wickedly. He doesn’t get an ounce of mercy from me!!



I felt his body sink as he gave up, and began trembling as I again lined myself up. Mouth over my pussy, nose against my asshole, and I sat as heavy as I could, also using my feet to pin his head completely still.



What happened next was fucking magical! I peed straight into his mouth for what had to be 2 and a half minutes straight!!! I could smell how strong it was just from him breathing out through his nose behind me! Omg barf!!! 🤢🤢



As I was filling his mouth repeatedly with my hot, sour, unbearable piss, I sharted again. A loud quick splat that spat all over his nostrils! And then I felt another one. This one was long and brutal! Airy and thick at first, it went on for like six seconds, and then it changed suddenly into a splattery wet butt bomb that detonated and painted his nose with so much force that he literally shook the huge king mattress like six inches off the frame!!



The sounds he made were straight out of a scene from Saw. And of course it just made me sooo fucking wet, and now rivers of thick cum and pussy sweat were oozing into his mouth along with my piss, forcing him to consume more of my Goddess Sauce!



And I kept farting. Another shart. Then rotten eggs. Then bubbly blorps that just reeked of pure shit. The smell was making me literally dizzy and my throat was closing off as I choked and fanned the air in front of my face. Another fart. Quick. More piss. He snorted and choked, gargling and screaming at the top of his fart-filled lungs!



Another fart. This one was lonnnng. Maybe 8 seconds? It came out slow and deep, screaming against his tormented nostrils as it seeped into his unwilling nasal passage. But with a mouthful of piss, he had to breathe somehow… 😈



After I finally stopped peeing, I collapsed forward on him, moaning happily as he lifted me up and down rapidly with his heaving, pleading breaths.



“Oh my FUCKKKKING god Haley let me up… let me up let me up please I’m going to puke!!! Please I can’t!!!” He begged desperately.



I moaned again happily, getting sleepier by the second. “Shut up slave. You’re going to be my mattress now since you suck as a body pillow. Night night…”



“No no no no no no no no please no!!!!” He wailed. I smirked and wiggled myself backwards, muffling him with my disgusting crotch and asshole, and quickly started milking his nose with my ass.



“Be sure and sniff my farts real deep loser! If the smell wakes me up, you’ll be punished again!!”

 I sang out devilishly.



I spent the next 30 minutes gently, lightly stroking his leaking cock, making him rock hard, and keeping him on edge as I farted and sharted up his nose over and over again.



And just when he was literally screaming for release (both for his cock and from his literal bondage prison), I let his cock slip out of my hand and drifted off, leaving him helpless, trapped, pent up, and buried my sweaty, swampy, unshowered, shart-buttered asshole until I woke up several hours later to continue his punishment… and I actually woke up rubbing and sucking his cock! So who knows how long I was edging him in my sleep too!! 🤣 🤣 But I do that a lot so… oops! 🤷‍♀️ 



Mmmm. What a great morning and start to the day!!! 💁‍♀️



I already know I’m having Taco Bell for dinner tonight! And I know that I’m going to be restraining him and using him as my mattress again! And it’s so great knowing I can just pee into his mouth when nature calls in the middle of the night! What I don’t know is how much sleep he will be getting, or how many times he throws up in his mouth in the middle of the night! 🤔

Lily Potter woke up in a bed that wasn't hers in a room that wasn't hers. She stood up slightly disoriented, her legs felt like they were made of jelly and her head hurt and throbbed as if someone had hit her with several Stunning Spells in a row.

It took a few seconds for Lily to realize that her body was different than she remembered. First of all, her arms and legs appeared larger and in essence it seemed like she was a little taller than she remembered. At that same moment, she noticed the mirror in the corner of the room and ran, or rather tripped, to be able to see how she looked.

The moment her eyes landed on the figure reflected in the mirror her expression was filled with confusion and complete disbelief, only clouded over could she manage to announce one name ""Tuney"". Lily began to feel her own face to make sure she wasn't seeing things.

At that moment a tall, fat man opened the door and said, ""Petunia, I was worried. When I woke up you were still sleeping and when I tried to wake you up to make coffee, I realized you were burning up with fever. I was already thinking about taking you to the hospital.""

Lily's face or rather Petunia's became completely empty, she also looked extremely pale. Seeing this, Vernon became restless and asked ""Pet... are you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost.""",6,1736123631.0,HPfanfiction,1,1.0,False

The DLC burrs were great, but I couldn't help but think there were better burrs out there. Originally I bought the Lab Sweet v3 with red speed and loved them. Compared to the DLC I perceived more flavor separation and more sweetness, which are two of the most important things for me with my espresso. To give a sense of what kind of beans I was putting through them I almost exclusively buy from Hydrangea, Moonwake and Flower Child. After a while I began to wonder if I'd made the right choice because I was a little annoyed I couldn't go fine enough on certain beans to pull a 30s shot. I ended up finding SSP MP and HU burrs second hand so I put all 3 SSP options to the test.

Lab Sweet v3 (LS3) - Gave me the best balance of body, sweetness and acidity. Pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in a burr. Downside is it doesn't go as fine as the others so for older, more processed, or decaf coffees I won't be able to pull a 30 second shot; probably will only be able to pull 15-20 second shots. 18g in 39-41g out is my sweet spot. Grinding at just barely before chirp for most beans but up to 4.

Multi Purpose (MP) - Probably the easiest to dial in specifically because you need to pull a longer shot to get the flavor balance you want. This translates to being able to use a slightly larger range. More of a thin shot that needs to be a long pull to not be too acidic. 18g in 49-51g out is my sweet spot. Grinding at 10 - 15. I also tried these for pour over in the hopes I could stop using a hand grinder (ZP6), but found the ZP6 to have higher clarity and more sweetness.

High Uniformity (HU) - Definitely the most ""classic"" set of burrs. Tons of body, barely any acidity. Fairly easy to dial in but requires a short shot for it not to be too bitter. 18g in 30-32g out is my sweet spot. Didn't pull many shots with these but was around 5 give or take.

Ultimately sticking with the LS3s, which is the first set I bought. Guess it's good to know what you don't want to validate the decision of what you want. The good news is I got the other 2 burrs for the price of one set and can gift the others to friends.",1,1736123545.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Blue by AAM: A serious, no-nonsense CEO vibe. Perfectly clean and crisp, ideal for interviews or professional settings. 10/10.


Yeah: Similar to Blue by AAM but with a fun, playful twist. Perfect for evenings or nights out. 9.5/10.


Kingdom: Sweet, rich vanilla all the way to the dry down. Reminds me of Hawas with its prominent papaya-like vibe but leans into vanilla instead. Fantastic for dates or chill nights with friends. 9.5/10.


💔 The Disappointments


9PM: Feels like a watered-down version of Kingdom. Starts with a bubblegum wrapper vibe, but longevity is a letdown—gone in an hour with no memorable dry down. Won’t be buying again.


Khamra Qahwa: Boozy and bold, but not my style. If you’re expecting coffee, it’s just 5–15% of the profile. Pass for me.


Oud for Glory: Smells like high-quality incense sticks straight out of a temple or prayer hall. Beautiful for what it is, but not something I’d wear.


SNOI and CDNIM: Both hyped to the heavens, but I couldn’t vibe with them. Smells like freshly cut lemongrass—great if you love that sharp, zesty green note, but overwhelming and not for me.


Vintage Radio: Medicinal, herbal-ice-cream vibes. Couldn’t find a single scenario where I’d wear this. Great for fans of niche medicinal scents, but it’s a hard ""no"" for me.


Final Thoughts:
I’m testing these in a South Indian climate—usually hot and humid, but it’s been a rare, cold few months here. This might influence how the scents performed for me. Which ones should I try next as an Average indian joe.",1,1736123535.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,0,1.0,False

I believe this will be my last post,

i copy paste my most significant mumbo jumbo.

thank you all and god bless 🙏

https://www.reddit.com/r/Portalawake/s/42D9j5sEOg


my previous post,

God , Satan and human evolution 

for some reason, something has formed in my mind .
a series of questions answers and thoughts keeped coming up  regarding the true nature of things. 
don't know how to start..so i just will

-God's way  : top to bottom,all potentials, timeless and limitless, the struggle and sacrifice of creation/separation from within.

-Lucifer's way: bottom to up phenomenon , made of parts,matter,self identification .


-Satan / Lucifer is real and the ruler of earth but God is eternal-

among the angels that God has created Satan is the most special , his rebellion against God
was certainly God's intention.
and is not evil from Gods perspective .

there is an allegory to explain things to come:

a soul of a man came knocking at heaven doors,
God then asks him: who is there?
the soul answers: it is ""I"" 
but not allowed to come in .
only when the soul realised and answered:
it is only you (God) that is there,
the soul allowed into heaven .

such was Satan's rebellion and the reason he was expelled from heaven , he dared to say 'I'  and have his own way. an illusion.
the earth,objective and the physical have been created in that way and is ,Satan's kingdom,  everything in it says ""I"".
separated and alien to underlying subjective .
and so is all modern science and medicine for that matter.

- Adam and Eve, Satan , Jesus and evolution -

at the garden of Eden, the fruit of the tree of knowledge is given to humanity by Satan,
because what is to be perceived as separate ego, ultimately comes from the thinking , dissecting mind,it is a battle ground for what falsely claims to be the real ,and everything else that makes that even possible, but seen as ""nothing but.."".

 as seen by evidence in a development of an individual, and corresponds to the of evolution humanity.   the scenes of self travels up , from the stomach, lungs, mouth to be behind the eyes .
Christ or the third eye consciousness is the next step, that was Satan's whole purpose in a sense.
the fire that is created between the known and the unknown, is the birth of the true self.


Alternative Creation Story 

-plus short analysis at the end-



it's a story about god's dream:

in the beginning,there was nothing.
 and then ,the dream was everything. 
everything roared like a lion with countless eyes , ramming and devouring each other .
seasons came and nothing left,and in their dreams they saw nothing.

in the second dream there were two dreams .
there was a wild boundless garden with many, what you would call ,sheeps , wolfs and bushes with thorns and sweet fruit .
many creatures ,all roaring with life .
and there was a Gardener who saw in his dream what the beasts and plants are seeing in their eyes.

after he saw in his dream that everything ""I""s and roars ,even the sheep thought that they were lions.
 
he immediately tended to cut down the thorny bushes that the sheeps got tangled with while eating the sweet fruit, that naturally made them drunk and even grow their wool resembling the main of a lion .
he built a fence of the thorny bushes , and a gate ,so the sheeps could go out to the fields of the wild bush.

then he fed the hungry wolf who couldn't get near the thorns of the bush that the sheeps were traped in.
and in return the wolf became loyal to the gardener ,and helped to impose his will on the wild.

the sun came,and the drunk sheeps did not burn in the bush with the dry thorns, but were trimmed ,and herd by the wolf to safety.
 
wild beasts came and the loyal wolf fended them off. floods came and the fences protected them.

in your dream, the third dream,
there are three dreams .
 the second dream ,that of the garden, the Gardeners dream and his deeds . 
and the first dream of the roaring sheeps , that threatened to burn everything in their drunkenness, in a garden of dry thorns and starving wondering wolves. 

all had to give up the the thing that they loved most, the thing that defined them,
but separated them from eachother and eventually from life itself.

they had to separate from them selves to for the principal of existence ,in the image of god.

                  -end-


-analysis and characters-

this story weaved in my mind from separate metaphors an impressios,

sheep vs lion -
a metaphor i heard once ,
of something in us that thinks its the king that protects and knows everything but in turn causes stagnation. it is said that in order to overcome this,we should make that lion in to a lamb and sacrifice it.

the sheeps- 
many as one ,opposed to singular that is many and therefore opposed to god.
also represents the multitude of personas the individual has .

also the sheeps connection to dreams ,as in counting sheeps before falling asleep.

there is of course the story of the coffee bean , the strange behaviour of goats after eating from the coffee bush, ,which are not sheeps but close enough.

the wild bush - represents in this case the beliefs we passively accumulate ,that if unattended grow wild ,and restrict our ego.
but can be shaped merely by conscious light,
to gather ,protect and feed it .

the wolf/dog -  represent intuition, connection to the unknown.
considered  as  one of the greatest conquers of man.
c g Jung talked about how the archetyp of a saviour ,or jesus, experienced as a dog in the dreams of his patients. 

numbers- 
0 -nothing - ultimate potential
1-something
2-something from nothing,separation , duality , stagnation 
3-the observer - the third elusive force that overcomes duality and stagnation. represents  motion,life .

dreams -  from the unknown , connection to past and future 
...
ok
there is always more ,
but need to go on with life.

thank you for reading 

apologies for the.. wording and grammar,,
it looks ok to me right now but there is always something 
 
hope you liked it

-conversation between satan and me -

m:hi ,i was wondering about stuff.. .

s: ..don't bother yourself.. see ,the whole world is random and crazy, your parents ,two confuse sacks of rotting flesh and rattling bones, fucked ,had a stupid baby, and that's you.  so go out, do the same and enjoy or don't, I don't care ,you have free will to do whatever you want, as I said, we can even cut a deal , either way I'll scatter your meaningless atoms across the infinite universe .that's the only way things can go here in my world . 

m: wow ,, that's a mouthful..could you do it other way? do you have free will? 

s: are you crazy ? don't you see all the multiplicities I'm all those things ,, it's a mess..

m: so you're the creator ?

s: I am things ,and would be random as I can ,and just freeze... but something makes me move and silly coincidences occur, .look at yourself.
 ..but it's all just random happening of separate things, and I am all those things, Im god. 

m: i know ..but things that happen, didn't you say they're happen only in one way they could.? 

s:yes .. nothing you can do 

m:so.. all random separate happenings must stand ,so that one thing could take place? 

s: ,, you could say so, , like your death!,muuhahahaha..

m: damn, that's .. funny..hh.. anyway,.it seems like, if that's the case, you could almost say that all random separate things and happenings,
 know somehow what the other random things are doing... i mean,could they be connected after all?

 s: F you, you're nothing but ..

m: come on.. you said yourself that there are silly coincidences, just trying figure out your world, since I'm here and all.

s: I don't need your help . this is nothing , I am the only thing that came into being and I don't care from where.
and that's right, you're stuck here with Me, I'm in your head.. there is nothing to figure out.  it's all just in your stupid imagination. 

 m: what... like its all a dream ,and everything is just me, and I should treat you and everything as such? 

s: smartass.. imagine that: I'm gonna get you in the end. 

m: yes I know, you'll have what's yours.

**ProfessionalUsual104**

>Great, now my brain wants to know about Canadian arcade bylaws...

**OOP**

>The long and short of it is they tried to curb kids loitering in arcades in the 80's so they passed a bunch of weird bylaws or just banned arcades in particular zones. When arcades died out, the laws just stayed in place.

>There were lots of variations. One area only allowed arcades in malls with a shared public entrance. If I recall Maple Ridge BC had particular hours you could be open and all windows had to be clear so you could see inside and no kids during school hours (so you'd have to know all the hours of all the schools in the area). Vancouver was 19 and older only. Seems like most places around the lower mainland of BC had old laws in place and most councils weren't interested in revisiting the laws.

>I do know Abbostford went through their laws about 10 years ago and nuked all the old arcade language and just clumped it into something like indoor recreation. They also got rid of some law about walking your cow in the street.

>It's been a year since we opened Seven's Pinballorama and I thought I'd give Reddit an update.

>My previous post about the arcade is here. (Editor’s note: link removed)

>Things have been going really well at the arcade. We've had ups and downs, but mostly ups. We did get hit with a hurricane last year. It didn't do damage to the building but the winds thrashed the island. Most of the island was without power for 12-14 days (some longer). The arcade was without power and internet for 10 days if I recall. There were long gas pump lines of jerry cans for generators. There are still areas with lots of downed trees and old barns and houses are sprinkled around the island which became unrepairable after the storm.

>We've been doing a steady business since opening. We had numbers we wanted to hit each month and we always hit them. We've done lots of birthday parties. I think our youngest was 7 years old and the oldest was a guy turning 81. We see lots of date nights and people who just like to play games. We have a large group of regulars we see several times a month. We still don't have a demographic. We get people of all ages and genders in here and it varies by the day.

>We've changed our game lineup a little and brought in a handful of video arcades. I think we're at 38 pinball and 10 video right now - but I'm always moving things around from inventory I have off-site. We brought in more video because we found some kids start to get bored of just pinball. The video games offer them some entertainment. I even brought in a couple of little home versions of video games because they're the size of little kids - and the little kids love them.

>We're having our official one year anniversary July 15th. We're having an open house and letting people in the arcade for free 90 minutes before we normally open. We're offering free coffee, drinks, snacks - and I ordered a bouncy castle for kids. I figure the people here have been so great to us, I'll do a little in return. I'm looking forward to it.

>So here we are, a year in, and I don't regret quitting my IT job. There are hurdles in running a small business, I work a lot right now, but I feel more satisfied at the end of the day. Also, some of that work is playing games with customers, so I can't complain too loudly.

**Shoddy-Ingenuity7056**

>When I saw your post my mouth dropped, in your photo dead center is a machine I’ve been looking for that was operational for my father to play. My grandfather worked for Ohio vending and worked on all sorts of vending machines and my father learned all about them as he was usually in tow to grab tools. He was brought up in a small marina town in northern Ohio that happens to have a penny arcade (63 just pinball machines) and dance hall. I have heard many stories about his times at both places, he worked at the arcade where he sorted silver out of change (and also developed a pack day cigarette habit at 8). Anyhow he has talked for years about the best pinball machine he had ever played, Palooka! I have already sent him a screenshot of the photo and the website, there is a family reunion annually in upstate NY, if we can swing it we will be headed your way this year! Thank you so much for posting!

**OOP**

>I have a story about my Palooka. (Sorry, this got long.)

>It used to be in a restaurant in White Rock BC in the late 60's, early 70's. One day the operator of the machine started packing it out. The restaurant owner asked what he was doing with it and the guy said it was going to the landfill. It had stopped earning enough due to all the quarter play pinball machines (Palooka was only a dime to play) so he was dumping it. The restaurant owner paid him $75 and took it home.

>The son of the restaurant owner grew up playing the machine in the restaurant and then later in his house. Years later he moved out, got his own house, and Palooka followed him.

>Over time Palooka started to break down. He put some money into it and got it running, but more years go by and it's no longer working again. The son decided it was probably time to sell it, but he was really split on it. At one point the restaurant burned down and the son told me Palooka was one of the few material things that survived those early years in the restaurant. Childhood memories and such, it had a special place in his heart.

>He listed it for sale for way too much (partly because he wasn't sure the value and I think partly due to sentimental value). I went to check it out and was honest with him on the condition and what it would take to get going again. Everything was rusted, the game was pretty rough, didn't start, the front wood was severely chipped and gouged and most the paint was missing. I made him a fair offer and told him my plans to restore it and put it in an arcade.

>He declined and we shook hands. I told him if he ever changed his mind to call me.

>I'm 10 minutes out his front door and my phone rings. He said he thought about it and really liked the idea of this game being back in the public and being loved again.

>I don't have his contact information any more, so I can't tell him, but he got his wish. It is well loved in the arcade and sees a ton of plays. It's one of the few in here that everyone who comes in has to try. Most of these machines are just machines to me. They're working assets I have for the business.

>But, there ARE a few special ones.



**OOP on arcade sounds**

>We have a couple sets of headphones in the arcade for people who have a hard time with the sound. We've had a few kids really benefit from them.

>I have a bit of an acoustic background as well from having set up a number of home recording studios. My plan was always to build some treatments to hang around I just haven't had the time yet. It's not too bad in there right now though. The treatments would definitely help tighten the sound in the room up. Reduce the overall din and make games easier to hear.

>It's on my list of things to do.

**OOP on food and drink**

>We started with a few little candy items and soft drinks and then expanded our candy selection. At one point we brought in chips and crisps but they really didn't sell very well. We let those taper off and filled that space with more candy items. That's doing pretty good and we want to expand on it. We have people come in just for candy now.

>I just brought in peanut brittle with ghost peppers and some freeze dried candy. I'm looking for more interesting impulse items like that.

>We also went crazy on soft drinks and have around 120 different flavours (and growing). We found local producers of craft sodas and also have other brands you don't normally see - Pop Shoppe, Jones, Jarritos, Boylan, etc. Stuff in bottles. These have been really popular. We also have the regular coke/pepsi items.

>We are right next door to a pizza place - which some of our customers use. We let them bring pizza in the arcade and eat it.

>I don't know if I would want to expand and have our own kitchen. At least not right now in this location. I do want to bring in espresso and maybe cafe food things like muffins and scones. Limiting to quick, stand and eat finger foods.

>We are now a distributor for the company that makes Lava Lamp and sold a ton of those over the holidays. You can't see it in the picture but we've got about 30 Lava lamps running in the arcade. I want to expand those types of items as well. Interesting toys like magic tricks, plastic dog poo, sea monkeys, little science toys. Wacky stuff like that. The test items we've brought in have sold so I think it's a fun direction.

**And**

>I do have a ""no outside food or drink"" sign on the door, but I usually tell people it's cool, just don't set drinks/food on the machines.

>If someone wants to buy a hamburger and eat it in here, I don't really care because it's not like I sell hamburgers.



# “Update” 2: Last year I opened a retro arcade in Canada. I wanted to have a really unique selection of soft drinks. How am I doing so far?

**OOP responding to a deleted comment**

Enjoying life is a ton of work. I'm tired. I'll have a few days off in a few months though - so there's that.

**western-information**

>enjoying life is a ton of work

Not a fan of this paradox

**1quirky1**

It is easy. Just two rules:

1. Be stupid rich like the 1%.
2. Don't be poor.

**OOP**

I forgot both those rules.

Instead I went with;

* Come up with crazy scheme
* Throw all your money at it and hope for the best.



**Redditforever12**

>are you profitable? i dont know how arcades can really be profitable unless you do a food/beer combo kind of thing.

**dracostheblack**

>He opened a second one i would imagine he has to be?

**OOP**

>We moved to a new larger location. Closed the original. We've been profitable and the larger location is needed because we had to turn away people at the old location because we'd hit capacity. Also had to turn away private rentals and parties because we didn't have room for the people they wanted to bring in.



**OOP on pay-to-enter**

>That's what we do. Pay to enter. $14.95 for an hour, 5 cents more for two hours. All machines and games on free play.

**And**

>I stamp hands with the time their session expires.

**Nanostrip**

>You should just buy a bunch of drones that hover over each individual person. When they're still in a valid session, the drone shines a green LED. When the time expires, the light turns red and starts zapping them until they get their ass out of your arcade.

**OOP**

>I like it!



**OOP on owning his games**

>When I was collecting games for the arcade I bought mostly broken ones. They're cheaper and I could learn how to fix them.

>We've been debt free for the past two years but the move we had to take a little because I went over budget. We should have that paid off by Jan/Feb if our numbers are like last year.

>The new location has a candy store in the front and lots of unusual soft drinks. We're also bringing in coffee/espresso

**OOP on starting the business**

>My girlfriend and I bought a pinball machine for the house not knowing if we'd play it. We played the crap out of it. A year later we had about 8 machines shoved in the extra bedroom and people coming over all the time to play. We thought maybe we were on to something.

>I did some research on arcades and different models (pay to enter vs coin drop vs barcade vs family friendly vs etc)

>I spent over two years buying mostly broken machines and learning how to fix them. I figured I could always resell them later and make my money back if the arcade never pans out.

>We moved to PEI with the intention of opening the arcade - then the pandemic hit. I hunkered down for a couple years and waited it out.

>It has been worth it. We've been growing what works. We brought in candy and snacks at the old location. That did well so the new location has a proper candy store as a second revenue source. I'm going to bring in coffee/espresso as the new location is in a business park with nothing else like a cafe around. Try to get a third revenue stream going.

>It's been hard work. Some really frustrating times when a bunch of machines on the floor all blow up at once, but the new location has space for a proper workshop so that will help.

I want to save enough money to help myself through college and I am working at one job right now which pays $20/hr. I have been working at this place for 6 months now; however, I am only working 2 days a week which roughly means 11 hours per week. 

I am considering getting a second job, a more relax job such as my local coffee shop or nearby boba place where I can go to after school to work. Im not expecting the pay to match my first job but even a little bit would be helpful.

Academically, I am doing fine with a 3.94 gpa and on track to graduate so I know for a fact that having a job does not hold me back. But I wonder if that would be the same case with two jobs.

That's my number one trigger for a spiral.
""Cuffed jeans mean you're gay!"" ""If you ever dreamed of going to boarding school as a child you're gay!"" ""If you main [character] in [video game] you're gay!""

At my worst I have to shamefully admit I've in my exhaustion felt like I don't like gay people or they've wronged me in some way by picking apart my identity in ways I never thought to. These ideas feel like WebMD when I struggled with health OCD and felt like a headache must indicate a brain tumor. I cuff my jeans and I like oat milk the best of the milk alternatives next I'll want to leave my husband even though it's my biggest fear.
I had a new consideration that brought me comfort though. How does all of this make gay people with OCD feel? How do gay people with OCD feel when they're told gay people dress a certain way that they don't dress, order their coffee and tea a way they don't? Considering these stereotypes might be hurting them too broke the ""vs."" mentality that was developing and took away some of their power. I love gay people, I love and have tons of respect for the Queer community. This disorder, my anxiety, and the layers of discomfort is the antagonistic force.

I am a 30+ year old guy living in San Diego and after several years I am getting back into dating. I’m just looking for suggestions on where to meet women besides the typical grocery store, coffee shop, etc.

For some context I have no desire to hook up with my female co-workers or the women I see at my gym. I like going to clubs and bars but they have been a mixed bag for me. I’ll spend time at shopping centers and the beaches but it can be overwhelming at times. I’ve read in similar posts that volunteering is a great way to meet women. However with my schedule and other obligations, Sundays would be the only day I can offer my time. In terms of hobbies (besides working out), I like to do graphic design (mainly t- shirt art) and listening to EDM/trance music (I am always on the lookout for local EDM events).

 

I am also open to online dating, getting feedback on what to include on my profile from my friends. However,  I still think my best chances is meeting women IRL instead on relying on computer algorithms.    ",5,1736123046.0,AskMenAdvice,11,1.0,False

In November I saw him at the gym which was a surprise. We had a convo there catching up about life but in my head I was keeping emotional distance. He said we should meet up and I said I wasn't gonna hold my breath. He was quite surprised with that and I told him every time I try to meet up with him he ignores me and he was like no I've been trying to meet up with YOU. Not true.

Anyways after I saw him at the gym he messaged straight after saying it was good to see me and we should get a coffee. Unfortunately we were both busy but I did say we didn't have to rush it. I was just happy that it seemed my words stuck with him and he was making an effort.

End of that month it was his birthday. I wished him a happy birthday but no response. I thought nothing of it. New years comes around I wish him happy new year. No response as well. At this point I was like I don't wanna keep overthinking this friendship and decided to delete his number.

He happened to reply today and this is what I said.

Before I saw him at the gym in November, our messages before that was me asking in January 2024 if he wanted to meet up and no response. It's easy to scroll into our convo to 2023 because it's more of the same. He says a couple things then radio silence for months.

Anyways was I overreacting. Or should I just have met him for coffee and told him this then? My thinking of that was, when I ask him to meet up, crickets. But then as soon as he asks, I come running? It just didn't sit right with me to go..

My diet is pretty on point, I am taking NAC three times a day, 200 billion plus of probiotics and sacc b, multivitamin and 3 grams of vitamin c spread through out the day. Just curious to hear what people thoughts are. My hope is to switch to Nystatin when the dieoff stops but it just will not let up.

According to the mycotoxin test, I may have aspergillus and candida together, which I hear is not that uncommon. Waiting on OAT test results and in home dust spore test.

The dieoff are symptoms are the classic heavy brain fog, sensitive to bright lights, light head aches. The better my diet, the more dieoff. The feeling is tied directly to the anittifungal usage. I am currently taking Nutricidin three times a day, an hour before meals. 

I will say my poops are looking so much better the last month. I also think I cured my leaky gut symptoms. I put creatine, collagen, and colostrum in my coffee every morning.

A little reddit and back to sleep. Back awake around 8:00. 'I need food smokes and coffee.' Wallet. Belt. Phones. Chargers. Knife. Smokes. Lighter. Dig mini lock and keys out of pack. Out of the tent. Lock tent.

'There's a McDonald's just up the road. Nice! I can charge my phones and use some wifi. Gas station nearby for smokes. DG for food on the way back. Easy street.'

I get the cheapest smokes I can get. Head for McDonald's. I walk in and look for an outlet. There's probably fifty of them... With the recepticals pulled out and plates over the boxes. ""They're ain't any."" I look over. ""None?"" No answer. I dig out my last two bucks and change for a cup of coffee. Sit at a table. Get the phone I don't need for contact with dude this morning about work out. Both phones around 40%. 'At least I can use some wifi.' No wifi. 'What kind of McDonald's is this?' Fuck it. I got data.

Drink coffee. Check weather. Smoke a cigarette. Drink more coffee. Time for some food.

I head to DG. Running low on ebt so get some Lunchables type things, two for a buck chips, dollar thirty-five cookies, and a Body Armor for $1.50. About $10 total. 'Perfect.""

Outside. Find an outlet. Phones plugged in. 'At least I'll charge and have some entertainment back at the tent until dude calls.' Sitting on the sidewalk I start eating. Almost through my third Lunchables type thing my phone rings. ""Hey 'dude' how are ya?"" ""I'm good. Where are you?"" I tell him. ""Ok. We're coming to you probably take half an hour."" ""No worries. It'll take that long to get back and get my gear together. Better yet, how about you meet me at 'building I'm camped across from'."" ""Ok."" Click. Dude is not big on goodbyes. Good with me. I'd rather be clear and concise and efficient.

I grab my food, unplug my charger, grab phones and cables, and get back to camp. Gear together and out of tent. Tarp off. Tent down. Tarp and tent on pack. 

Gear on. Over to said building. An suv follows me into the parking lot. Business is closed today. 'It's a half hour later. 'That's probably him.' I look at vehicle across parking lot. A few minutes later it drives off. 'Maybe he took one look at me and changed his mind. Nah. He owns a couple big businesses here. He's got enough balls to come over here and tell me.' Gear down. Sit on bench at front door. Light cigarette. 

My phone rings. ""Hey 'dude'."" ""Hey man were about to pull up over there. You at the DG?"" ""No the other place. Right in front of their front door."" ""Ok. See you in a minute."" Click.

Dude pulls up with a friend. I throw my stuff in, minus my umbrella. He's got questions. I got answers. We go straight to a buffet without a word about it. Get food. More questions. More answers. At one point he says, ""Well you've had fifty years and not made something of yourself."" I let it go. I'm not gonna explain my way through his ignorance. More questions. More answers. He's telling me about the last 15 people he's tried to help that fucked him over. I can only tell him I don't want to carry any more weight and it's a huge waste of my time and effort to take something of his to the pawn shop. I'd be better off hitchhiking. He seems to think I'm just like every jerk-off he's helped that screwed him. I'm not gonna argue. That's a waste of breath for me and I'm sure he's heard it all before.

Every time dude isn't around his friend of 30 years is giving me helpful pinters on what to tell him. He tells me, ""If you win 'dude' over he'll do everything he can for you."" ""His brother told me he was a good guy."" ""He is. I've known him thirty years. I worked for him for twenty.""

We leave the buffet. More questions. ""I got a guy down on the coast I can probably hook you up with working on boats."" ""Sounds good to me."" He reminds me that soomeone is gonna have to put me up, get me to work - or let me camp at work- and give me a job where I'm gonna have to prove myself. 'As I didn't already know this.' ""Yeah I know it's a big ask. But I've run into situations where people did exactly that many times. And were happy to do it."" He calls his foreman, tells him about me and asks if they have anything tomorrow they can put me on. ""No."" The foreman is ex law enforcement and has heard every sob story around. He don't care, and isn't trying to help anybody out.

""What are you gonna do if we can't find something for you to do?"" ""I'm gonna continue south looking for work. The goal is to find work"" I tell him for the fifth time. I'm pretty much at the point where I don't see this going anywhere, my gear is packed beside me in the vehicle,it's not raining, and I'm about to thank him for the meal and have him drop me on the highway going to Mobile. 'Might as well go into Florida a little where it will be warm until this cold passes.'

""Tell you what. I'm gonna run you out to my camp for the night. There's running water, heat, wifi, and electricity. You can stay the night. If we can't find something for you to do we'll send you on your way with some cash."" ""Sounds good to me."" ""You're not gonna freak out because it's quiet out there are you?"" 'HELL FUCKING NO!!!' ""No"" I tell him. ""Just stack some blocks out of the way that used to be under a shed and clean up any trash outside."" ""No problem.""

Hus friend says, ""I know it's a little Deliverance-like, but you'll be fine out there."" ""I'm not worried about it. If I get killed my troubles are over.""

I look over at my gear. No umbrella. ""I hate to say this, but I left my umbrella outside that building you picked me up from."" ""You need it? Ha ha ha."" ""I don't carry anything I don't absolutely need"" I say light heartedly. Immediately his friend heads for said building. ""There's an umbrella there."" ""It looks just like mine too.""

We hit another DG on the way out. ""Get whatever you need for the night."" Done. He buys some treats for a homeless cat he sees when we get there. Out to the 'camp'. It's a one bedroom mobile home on five acres in the woods. ""We also lease another 200 acres around it."" 'Pretty sweet.' He shows me around the trailer. They leave. I get the blocks and wood shims up pretty quick. Get most of the trash up. Not much of either really. Take a break. He won't be back until around noon tomorrow. 'Fuck the rest of this. I'm worn out. My body hurts. I'll get the rest tomorrow morning. I wake up with the sun anyway.""

Here I sit in a 75 degree trailer way out in the woods in Mississippi. All my stuff charging. Fiber optic internet that's lightning fast. Listening to my thumbs up playlist on Pandora. 

We'll see what tomorrow brings. Doesn't matter to me either way.

I do not really fall on the masculine side of things.

Ideally want to find someone more dominant or willing to lead as im more submissive, but who I can also be friendly with and have fun with outside the bedroom, house, or play space. I love snuggling and cuddling. I would love someone to cuddle and watch horror movies with.

Let's grab a coffee and see if we get along, or go walk around the ROM and chat.

I love someon who can be in charge, tough when needed but is also encouraging, and caring/loving as well. Aftercare is a must. 

Touch is a big love language for me so I love giving massages, scratches, holding hands, cuddling.

My hobbies include, art (writing, drawing, pixel art), going to movies (love horror, and checking out movies at the revue, and TIFF), reading (also horror, sci-fi, etc), raves and edm shows, hiking and nature, board games and tabletop rpgs, and also just exploring toronto and finding things to check out. Im just as happy having a night in, with having a crazy night out.

I love to flirt and tease, and if you flirt with me first I'll melt into a puddle. I'm usually a bit shy when meeting new folks but love to chat and meet new people!

I am really into giving affection to my partner. I love providing massages and back/foot rubs too

1hullcc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hullcc,Homemade sheet metal bender ,"I needed a bender for an hvac project. This cost me $15 in materials at the local scrapyard. 

•2- 1/8"" angle 
•1-  1/8"" flat bar
•2 wingnuts/ 3 inch bolts
•self tapping screws 
•2 hinges 

It's 4 foot long, so after the hinges and wing nuts, it will accommodate a 3 foot wide sheet of metal. 
Whole project was probably 2-3 hours or 2 coffees and 8 beers. 

I screwed up my first set of bolt holes for the wing nuts, they were too far from the hinges which would not have allowed 3 foot sheets. Instead of hiding it, I figured I'd post the fix too. Measure twice cut(or in this case: drill) once. I guess I forgot that one today.

1hulk4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hulk4a/bad_parenting/,Bad Parenting,"I hide in the closet, trying to conceal my breathes. Glass shatters outside, yelling. Momma tries her best, but in the end, she never wins. It's always daddy. I try not to cry as I here momma cry. Daddy must have hit her. I've gotten used to this kind of stuff, so only one or two tears come out. But I can hear Daddy approaching my room. And he's angry. I would usually try and block the door, but I've found that only makes the whipping last longer in the end. So instead, I hide today. Daddy would find me. He always did. I was merely delaying the inevitable. I here my door slam open. Daddy always slams the door when he's angry. I here him looking around my room, rummaging my stuff. I hold back a sob as he crumbles a drawing I made more mommy. Oh well. I can make more. I listen for mommy. Usually she falls asleep after she argues with daddy, although I find it always a little weird that she sleeps on the floor instead of in bed.  The closet door flings open. Daddy grabs me and pushes me against the wall. I hold back yelps of excruciating pain as the belt hits my skin like a blade. After a while, though, he stops yelling, and leaves the room. This is when I cry. When daddy leaves, it's okay to cry. You don't cry around daddy.

The next morning, I eat breakfast like I usually do. But I can't find mommy anywhere. I look around everywhere, but there's no sign of her. She must be at work. Daddy is on the couch watching TV, his drink sitting on a side-table. I build up the courage to ask him where mommy is. He doesn't answer. Maybe he can't hear me. I walk towards him and ask again. The moment I do this, he bolts up and screams at me so loud it makes me shiver. ""STOP CALLING ME DADDY LITTLE CRAP! GO TO YOUR ROOM UNLESS YOU WANT A WHIPPING! ASK ME AGAIN AND I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU! GET OUT OF MY FACE, YOU DUMB STUPID MIDGET!"", and daddy just kept yelling these mean things at me over and over. I sucked it up, though. Daddy gets angry when he drinks his coffee. I run to my room and sit in my bed. I hear daddy going to his room. He's grabbing the belt. *No, no. Not again*. I run to my room and hide under my bed. *He won't find me this time*, I think. But daddy would find me. He always did.

I lie in bed, thinking about all the angry things daddy said to me yesterday. I try not to think too hard about it. Daddy get's angry when he has his coffee. I still haven't seen mommy. Usually she'd be back by now, but maybe she has to work an extra shift or something. It's early morning, and as I sit in bed, I hear footsteps coming to my room. *Maybe mommy's back*! I think. I run to the door just as daddy comes in. He's carrying a doggy cage in one of his hands. *Are we getting a doggy*?! I think excitedly. But when he opens the cage door, no doggy comes out. ""Get in"", daddy says. I'm confused. I'm no doggy. Is he maybe talking about a doggy behind me? I check, but it's just me and him in the room. ""GET IN THE CAGE YOU STUPID CHILD!"", he yells, the walls rattling. He's angry. I would usually try and hide, but this time, he's in my room. He would know exactly where I am. I hardly have any time to react before he shoves me in the kennel, locking the cage door. ""Daddy, let me out! I don't like this joke!"", I say. ""This is no joke"", He said. I try and calm down, thinking happy thoughts. This must be part of the joke. He puts me down in the living room. The doggy cage is so small. It's hard to breathe. ""Now you can't cause trouble, you little pest. Now you can't do stupid things!"". Daddy sounds so angry. I squirm. I keep telling him I think the joke is funny, if he can let me out now. He doesn't flinch.

It's been a week in the doggy cage, and daddy still hasn't let me out. I haven't seen mommy. He only let's me have a little water at a time. I haven't eaten anything yet. My stomach grumbles. I stopped crying the first day after daddy yelled at me for doing so. This was my life now. I've gotten used to it. If I think real hard, I can be wherever I want. Free. Happy. I smile from time to time. Cry sometimes, too. But only when daddy is not around. Because you don't cry when daddy is around.

The front door bursts open as tons of big guys with guns charge into my house. Daddy is in his room. One of the men comes up, and sort of gasps when they see me. I must look pretty ugly, I think. Mommy bathes me, and since I've been in here and she's been gone, I haven't been washed off. ""It's okay, kid. Where going to get you out of here"", he says. He unlocks the kennel door and pulls me out, carrying me on his shoulders. I take in a big gasp of air. It feels so much more open out of the cage! I see daddy being pushed out of the room, chains on his hand. He looks angry. I want to ask what's going on, but I know daddy will get angry. The man carrying me answers the question for me, though. ""We've gotten a call from some neighbors that there's been some major abuse in this household. We're getting you out of here and to safety, little girl. Don't you worry"". I'm not sure what ""abuse"" means, but it sounds like a naughty word. As I'm carried out of the apartment, I see daddy being pushed into a black car, two armed men getting in alongside him. I'm carried in a car too, but get to ride up front. I giggle as I think about how jealous daddy might be that I get the front seat instead of him, but then frown as I think about the round of yelling and whipping I'd get for making a remark like that. ""Do you know where my mommy is, mister?"", I ask the man driving. He looks over at me, an odd expression on his face. He looks sort of... sad. ""She's left to live with the angels"", he says. I think about that. These angels sound nice. ""Can I meet the angels too?"", I ask. He glances over at me. ""Not yet, sweetie. Not yet..."".",12,1736122109.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

I'm looking for that beach/bohemian chill vibe, where I can focus on work and relaxation after many years of stress. I'm also looking to take my dollar a bit farther than I can here and save a bit of money. I have heard Tulum is expensive, but even with a superbly nice airbnb for 3 months, the cost of living seems like it would be significantly less than it is here in Canada for myself, I'm spending $2,500+/month. Unless I'm missing something? I'm not a partier and would maybe go to a beach club once a month for fun.

The real question is, can I work remotely in Tulum reliably? I'm hearing there's a lot of power outages. Ideally I'd love to stay in a place with backup power and Starlink. 

I'm looking at Airbnb's in Aldea Zama and La Veleta, leaning towards Aldea Zama at this point. I'm not a partier and I want to just have a nice space I can work in with the option of going to coffee shops, grabbing some tacos, and relaxing in the rooftop pool after the day.

I got some blood work done and my cortisol was above the reference range

I'm sure I was abusing caffeine, I was taking pre-workout with 200mg upon waking. And I would have another 400-500mg throughout the day. At the vet least, my relationship with caffeine was unhealthy, so I decided to take a month long break and I'm now on day 4.

My level of fatigue is insane. Been sleeping 10 hours and still can't make it through the day without a nap... My sleep also hasn't been all that deep out restorative. 

I've also been legitimately depressed. I suddenly feel so overwhelmed and incapable. Now, I have had issues with low mood, but nothing like this. 

I'm just not sure if I'm depressed because of the lack of caffeine? Or is it an effect of the poor sleep? Is my sleep poor because I'm depressed?

1hulehi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1hulehi/pain_flare_up_due_to_emotions/,Pain flare up due to -emotions-,"Male, 41 yrs old.

Apologies if the post is long winded, the cognitive issues are full on today 😁

Does anyone else experience a serious flare up in pain after being in what I’d best describe as an ‘emotional’ or even a stressful situation?

For me, this particular symptom started around 6 months ago.

It’s such bullshit.

Here’s just a few examples, and it works with both positive and negative situations.
It’s doing my fucking head in.

June 2024 we were preparing to move house.
My wife accidentally tipped over a box full of photos, letters etc from her dear Mother who passed away.
Knocked over her coffee at the same time and it went on the photos.
We both obviously reacted in a state of panic, straight away I ran out to gather cleaning products.
Came back and together we managed to salvage it all and get it all back in the box.
Roughly 5 mins later, any pain that I was already experiencing just intensified. Stayed that way for a few hours.

My youngest brother proposed to his Girlfriend a few months back. He called me to share the great news.
I was overjoyed, full of happiness and excitement.
10 mins after the phone call, BAM!! pain intensified.


This past NYE my 8yr old daughter cut her foot open on the base of the swing set.
My wife and I shared the duties one giving cuddles and the other cleaning and strapping her wound.
She was off again playing with her uncles like nothing happened and again, 10 mins later and intense flair up of pain.

For the last 10 years I’ve regularly seen a therapist 2-3 times a year, for dealing with trauma I experienced as a teenager.
Although the sessions can get quite deep and dark, previously I’ve always walked away from these sessions absolutely thriving and full of positivity, full reset and ready to take life by the balls.
The last two I had, I waited in my car for a couple of hours before I was right to drive because the pain was incredible.

And literally half an hour ago, my wife showed off her new bathers to me as we’re having a beach day.
She looked absolutely stunning in them, and it made my heart race like a silly teenager.
As I’m writing this the pain has jumped to incredible heights.

Even really mundane things like having our weekly chat of going over our finances, planning out our week, discussing work or events, if there’s the slightest hint of emotion involved (and these things I’ve just mentioned are all regular things we do and mostly always positive conversations) the pain just rises to all time levels.

Those close to me would consider me as a fairly stable person when it comes to my emotions, so to have this happen is just soooo fucking frustrating.

As a co leader of our family, why wife, and more so my children, view me as the problem solver and administer of affectionate words and cuddles when there’s issues or problems.
I love being this person, it’s what drives me as a human. I definitely won’t stop being who I am, but I need hours to recover from situations that normally are a non issue.
My wife is extremely understanding. My children don’t fully understand but oldest who’s 15 has a tiny grasp of what I’m going through.

She’s noticed me take 15-20 mins after certain situations, and when I’m back, she’s the one hugging me and letting me know everything will be ok, and something as small as this sets off the pain again!?!?!?🤣🤣🤣🤣

So cap it all off, positive or negative, tiny or huge, my nervous system really lets me know after these incidents.

Am I totally a fucking basket case?
Or does anyone else experience this?

Would love any feedback and thoughts 😊
Thanks everyone x

Completely lost track of time and conversation went smoothly in my opinion. I think she also enjoyed as she had messaged me her number before I even got home (didn't have a chance to exchange numbers on the date because had to rush for the last trains for a while after we walked after dinner) 

Her pictures from her profile were not so recent, but I don't mind, she was still beautiful and charming. However what confuses and concerns me is her age. Her dating profile has her listed as 32, but she said some stuff during the date that make me think she is 34/35. It's not a big difference and honestly it does not bother me. 
However, I am a little concerned about the fudging of the age on the profile and it makes me wonder what else might be being misrepresented?

So if you could posses the body of anyone who would you choose most zombies chose rich old white men. You ever wonder why there are so many of those guys about. Ever looked at a politician and thought couldn't you just die and let someone younger take charge. Well fun fact they have. But there are some problems with this there are only a few rich old men bodies left so the zombies are getting desperate. 

I bring this up of course because the rich old white man standing in front of my counter if Jeffrey Epstein. 

""Hello"" He said sheepishly. 

""Hello mr Epstein."" 

""I have recently came upon some information about the former host of this body, and I was wondering if there was anything you sell me to help my situation?"" He said trying to keep away from any aligations as of I might not have heard about it already. 

""Yeah. Are you wanting to keep the body or exchange it for another?"" 

""I would like to exchange it."" 

""Are you looking for another rich old dude or?"" 

""I'll take anything at this point just not someone like this if you understand?"" 

""Yeah I understand we have a bunch of old frankenstein's monster parts from the whole 5 Minute Crafts craze a few years back. I'm sure we can peice some things together for you."" 

Now this may seem like a small shop but it's actually pretty big. We have lots of departments like the coffee shop, garden department, pet section and as previously mentioned in my last post about the monsters hunter the adult section. As we are going through each of them. Lucy from the pet section comes running up to me. Out of breath she quickly says. 

""Hey Jess I've lost a Tailypo!"" 

""What's a Tailypo?"" I respond having never heard of Tailypo. 

""It's a small furry creature. Yellowish red eyes. Tufted ears. Likes the dark and most importantly."" 

She has a slight pause before noticing my customer. 

""Sorry is that Jeffrey Epstein?"" 

""He's a rather unfortunate zombie."" I respond. ""Were getting him some new body parts but if we see the thing you said about we'll either try to catch it or get you."" 

""OK"" said Lucy. ""Just watch out for it's tail."" 

So as we get through the rest of the shop we enter the warehouse where we keep the spare body parts. Unfortunately I don't know where the spare body parts are. Fortunately I know that Jack the warehouse manager would know where they are. Unfortunately again I don't know where Jack is. 

""JACK!"" I yell into the dark void that is the warehouse. ""JACK WHERE ARE YOU!"" 

""I AM OVER HERE! WHAT DO IS IT YOU DESIRE"" I hear a gruff voice somewhere to the left of me. 

""WE NEED THOSE SPARE FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER PARTS!"" I yell over to him. 

""AH YES THE 5 MINUTE CRAFTS CRAZE A FEW YEARS AGO! THEY ARE SOMEWHAT NEAR TO ME JUST FOLLOW MY VOICE!"" 

I have to say though it is unusual normally Jack would have lit a torch. Hey there he is. 

We have to look up to see Jack the red dragon peering over us. Standing next to a pile of copses and detached limbs. His large green eyes perfectly suited to finding anything from across the warehouse. And naturally occurring treasure keeping tendencies allowing the warehouse to be perfectly in order. 

""AH HELLO DEAR JESS. LOOKING FOR MONSTER PARTS ARE WE."" 

""Yes this unfortunate zombie has possessed a body with some negative associations. So we need a new one."" 

""HMM YES THAT IS QUITE A PREDICEMENT. THANKFULLY I HAVE KEPT SOME PARTS SO THEY ARE WELCOME TO BUY A NEW BODY."" 

""Yeah I'm sure there are some matching parts here sorry are you OK with Mr Epstein or would you prefer something else."" 

""Craig will do."" the zombie replied. 

""OK Craig so what will we be getting for you today."" 

""Hm I don't really know. I guess just something with a good few years before it decomposes."" 

""Yeah so we're wanting something newer. You got an age range in mind? A gender maybe?"" 

""Probably something a little older. Male. Preferably black hair if you have any."" 

""Yeah OK so would this work for you?"" I say as I pull a body out of the pile. 

""Hm yeah that works."" Craig says as he sees the handsome mid 40s body with black hair. 

As I look to see another happy customer I notice a small furry yellowish red eyed creature with tufted ears. 

""Craig there's a Tailypo on your head. Please do not move."" 

As I slowly edge towards the creature on his head I notice its tail now with a name like the Tailypo you would expect it to have an impressive tail. However not really it was a wiry little thing with strands of hair sticking out of it. Now this was not impressive however the Tailypo ripping its tail of and throwing it at me was both unexpected and impressive. 

""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! Oh my god it ripped its tail off."" 

I watch as the now tailless Tailypo scampered of in-between shelving units. As I pick up its tail I guide Craig back to the counter promising him use of my staff discount if he doesn't sumon my manager on me or Lucy. 

As I hand the tail to Lucy she looks extremely pleased saying something about how as long as no-one eats it the Tailypo should come back to retrieve their tail. 

As me and Craig return to the counter we we come to the agreement of £150 for the body which he agrees is well worth it for no more misunderstandings with any hit men.",4,1736121457.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1hula1h,https://i.redd.it/zrrcj5p6k9be1.jpeg,New Year’s Week odds and ends,"We knew it was going to be crowded, but for the most part, we didn’t really feel it. 

We arrived mid-morning on December 30, and miraculously, our room at Art of Animation was ready by 11am, just in time for toddler nap. That afternoon, we squeezed in the last of Festival of the Holidays and a Spaceship Earth before conking out. We really only felt the glut of people getting out around 6:30ish at International Gateway. 

New Year’s Eve morning we spent at Animal Kingdom, which was super chill. Had an excellent mid-morning safari with a ton of “giraffic.” That afternoon, we hopped to Hollywood Studios for a Muppet Vision 3D before turning in early to avoid the NYE Madness. 

1/1 was the Disney Junior breakfast at Hollywood and Vine (great) and Hollywood Studios. I did the single rider Rise of the Resistance (got in line at 10, got out by 10:20), which was in B-mode (no Kylo animatronic at the end), and I’m glad I didn’t wait for 2 hours or pay $25. Did Epcot that evening for dinner and the Frozen ride. 

The crowd was really felt at Magic Kingdom on 1/2, which filled up instantaneously. Still managed to get on the virtual queue for Tiana (loved it; last row, didn’t get wet), and we got First Citizens of Main Street pins for being first to our lunch at the Plaza. 

General odds and ends:

Lightning Lane: essential, but there has to be a better way to make it fair for non-hotel guests. All the popular stuff was gone by either in advance or by lunchtime. 

Virtual queues: Lightning McQueen over here got Guardians and Tiana. Guardians was down so we didn’t get to use it, but the victory was in the getting it. 

Transportation:
As always, the Skyliner is where it’s at, and I’m so impressed by how manageable the multi-line queue system is (especially compared to the standby and Lightning Lanes in the parks). The busses were sardine cans. Mears is serviceable. 

Food: Highlights of Festival of the Holidays were the Lomi Lomi Salmon and the frozen whiskey sour. 

The Isle of Java at Animal Kingdom (right at the end of Discovery Island before you enter Dinoland USA) and their Vietnamese iced coffees were my wife’s and I saving graces. They also have delicious breakfast sandwiches and you can go right next door to sit at Flame Tree Barbecue to eat them.

This is the second year we’ve stayed in a family suite in the Cars section of AOA, and have zero complaints - it’s centrally located to everything and our kid had the best time looking at all the cars outside and also at the Nemo playground on the way to the Skyliner.

1hul9ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hul9ph/guys_help_me_remember_the_name_of_an_anime/,"GUYS, HELP ME REMEMBER THE NAME OF AN ANIME!!!!","I'm looking for an anime I watched when I was a kid, around 2014/2015, but I'm pretty sure it was released between 2007 and 2010. I've looked everywhere, but I can't find it! I'll describe what I remember:



The anime had three main protagonists, all girls. They had Power Rangers-style combat uniforms, with different colors. The protagonist was red, had short hair, and was a bit stressed or temperamental. The girl in blue seemed to be the calmest and maybe wore glasses, with long hair. The third, green, I don't remember her so well, but she was part of the trio.



Later in the story, three other rival girls appeared, with uniforms in yellow, cyan, and magenta. Initially, they were villains, but in the end they joined forces with the protagonists to defeat the main villain, who was a guy in black armor, representing a ""supreme evil"".



The anime's setting was very typical Japanese, with urban and school elements. I remember a specific scene where the main characters were gathered in a coffee shop, a place made entirely of wood with the sunset in the background. The anime had a light and colorful tone, nothing too dark or heavy, and they fought monsters or robots using transformations and special abilities.



The visual style was very colorful and 2D, with light strokes, something more geared towards a younger audience. I watched this anime dubbed in Portuguese, and I remember that the red-haired protagonist had a very distinctive voice. It was shown on Netflix, but it was removed a long time ago.



What it's not:



It's not Pretty Cure, Tokyo Mew Mew, Shugo Chara, Senki Zesshou Symphogear, or any other well-known anime of this style.

1hul6xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bashar_Essassani/comments/1hul6xb/personal_contact_experience/,Personal contact experience,"One day I was listening to Bashar in the early afternoon. I think it may have been one called 'the window the door and the gate'. Anyway, he mentioned how for contact to occur we would need to meet them half way in vibration. I thought to myself, like an invitation, that they can meet me half way too. Time goes on and I completely forget about it. Later that night, lying in bed, ready to go to sleep, I hear an unusual ringing in my ears, and curiously, in a meditative fashion I allowed it to do its thing and allowed myself to tune into it as it was my intuition to do this. It began to change in pitch and new depth emerged in the sound until suddenly my whole internal landscape was saturated with an incredibly intense alien telempathic vibrating presence and the vague shining presentation of multiple humanoid beings surrounded by a backdrop filled with red vine like patterning that permeated the scene, along with an undeniable understanding that my reality was my own construction that was transmitted instantly without words. There was more to it than this but I cannot compress it into English, this should be enough to recognise it if you too have had the same experience. It was absolutely nothing like anything I have ever experienced or have experienced since. I have tried mushrooms before, this was not like that at all. The ET presence was eminating an intense vibrating sensation to my brain and this seemed to be forming the experience.

I have never experienced anything 'supernatural' like this before or since, apart from one time years back, before having anything to do with alieny stuff, I heard the same ringing in my ears when I was on a long semen retention streak and quit coffee, basically a good detox, again lying in bed ready to get to sleep, but that time the ringing became this blue sensation that felt like it was moving around my brain healing it. Interpreting it like a biologist, (I was completing a biology degree at the time but have now finished), I thought I must just be experiencing some sort of rare physiological process, although the experiece was accompanied by an eye watering sense of religious awe and profundity. Im not the sort of person that expected to ever have these kinds of experiences. I'm just a regular guy that has a fascination with a lot of different ideas, and suddenly through my exploration a 'real' extraterrestrial as far as I can tell opened up to me and permeated my mind for a few minutes as bizarre as that is, and all I seemed to have to do to invoke it was lightheartedly invite them to meet me at my vibration just as they invite us and then forget about it.

It wasn't like a dream, or at least anything like any dream I've ever had. It was like a presence that was so intense, I suppose so high vibrational, that it was transmitting its emotionality to me directly, in so far as I could pick it up
It was as though it was talking but without words, purely through this vibrational language that I could feel in my brain. It was unconditionally loving and yet had an almost demonic vibe too that was hard to put my finger on but to my understanding was a reflection of the level of unconditional integration of what we would call the shadow that is natural to them. At the time I felt like it must be happening for the whole world (I  was alone at the time) because it was so intense, so undeniably otherworldly and so unlike anything I have ever experienced.

In the end I opened my eyes almost out of fear to see what was going on and the experience ended and I couldnt find my way back. I was somewhat relieved and a somewhat disappointed. The whole experience seemed to be internal and yet felt realer at a level that completely overwrites ordinary life while it is happening.

Bashar has spoken of people who nearly met ETs but were overwhelmed by fear because the ETs vibration is so high that it raises the contactee's vibration to a point that it forces things to the surface they weren't ready to face, and now I  can see the reality of this and it still gives me chills.

Until 2 weeks ago i had 0 problems with my stomach. I never had GERD symptoms, pain, problems with my appetite. The only problem i had was a general case of bloating. To be honest, i never knew if it’s bloating or being overweight. (90 kg/ 187 pounds - 175 cm/ 8’9 height). I started a diet, i counted my calories, i ate a lot more healthy and lost over 10 kg/ 22 pounds in 6 weeks. Important note, i work as s barista and i consume a lot of coffee (on a normal basis 6-7 espresso per day). Another important note, throught the diet my first meal was usually at 16:00/ 04:00 PM, and i started my days with a lot of coffee and e-cigarretes. Normaly i eat around 1000-1500 calories per day. 

The problem: All the problems started 2 weeks ago when i started to have sharp chest pain, mild stomach pain, one episode of sore throat that lasted  8 hours. One day i had such a constant and sharp pain throughout the day that i had to go to emergencies at hospital. The doctor said that everything seems fine (lungs, hearth and blood tests). 2 weeks past and i still wake up every morning with these symptoms: sharp pain in the chest, mild stomach pain, reflux. All these symptoms fade if i eat, don’t drink soda/ coffee and smoke less. I will go run some aditional analylis this week. 

The questions i have, does it seem to be HPylori? Or a bad gastritis? Moreover, if i have HP does also my girfriend need to take antibiotics even without symptoms? Should i also seek tratment for my cat? Do i need to sterilize all my house?

1hukscu,https://i.redd.it/ibe7pns7g9be1.jpeg,Podcast episode recap,"Rachel says while it’s totally normal for people to go to the gym or do regular everyday life things after the sun sets in the winter, she simply can’t! once the sun sets she’s done for the day - well, must be nice to be able to choose not to continue adulting after sunset. She says her energy “just doesn’t work that way”. 

She then immediately goes into shamelessly plugging her new Substack that she announced earlier this week and she says that one of the things that appealed to her about this platform is that people don’t get as much hate from trolls on there, unlike IG. I think with all the craziness that she has been spouting in recent months people are calling her out on her bullshit, probably via DM because she really only posts on stories, and on this sub or course! She also says she needed a place for all of her writing to live. Didn’t she say when she launched her website recently that the website was going to be where everything was going to live?? 🤔 Why the fuck does she now need ANOTHER platform for her writing?? The only logical explanation I have here is that the traffic to her website is dead - and that apart from launch day, I don’t think ANYONE is visiting her website. I would love to see the stats, but anyway I think this is why she is now branching out to Substack. Oh and also because she will be able to monetize her writing by putting them behind a paywall via subscriptions 🤑

She says she wants to be on her phone less because social media is really bad for her mental health. But she also admits that when she steps away from her phone she feels alone because she doesn’t get the feedback (aka validation!) that she craves from her community. She goes into how she uses the excuse “but I make my money on social media - this is how I put food on the table” to justify being on the phone 24/7 but at the same time she’s very mindful about not being on the phone in front of her kids, which is basically a contradiction. if you’re on your phone 24/7 that means you are on your phone in front of the kids. She says Her kids NEVER see her in front of her screen. If she hears Lea approaching, she puts the phone away before Lea enters the room so she never has to see her mother on the screen and she never has to ask for attention and she always gets immediate eye contact from her mom.  Anyone who comes to their house is not allowed to be on their phone in front of her kids or she “goes crazy” - but in the same breath, she admits that while it’s easy to go off on other people about not being on their phone, she struggles with not being on her phone herself. 

She admits to getting sucked into the doomscroll cycle regularly, multiple times a day. She says “I check my DMS. I check my emails. I scroll a little bit and then I decide to put my phone away but then not long after that I make a nice cup of coffee and I wanna share it so I take a photo and I go back into Instagram to share it. and then I see an angry DM from someone who was offended by something I said, and now I’m feeling anxious and I have to reply to them. I need to know what did I do wrong?  She says she feels incredibly anxious, insecure, frustrated angry, sad - but also happy and excited (because of the dopamine hit) in a matter of five minutes on social media. 

now I don’t know about everyone else, but in my opinion, if your feed makes you feel all of these negative emotions then you have not curated your feed well enough. I personally don’t spend a lot of time on Instagram and I don’t follow a lot of people, but I know that the few accounts that I do follow NEVER make me feel any of those things. 

She says the shift happened for her while she was in London with Lea because she spent those four days completely off her phone (LIES!!) We all know this is not true - the amount of stories that she posted while she was in London was exorbitant and it doesn’t matter that she posted them all at night before going to bed. She still spent the whole day recording these videos so her phone was out for a lot of of the time, in front of Lea. she’s so full of shit. She claims her screen time used to be 4 hours a day and has now gone down to 2. I call BS! 

She says that her ultimate goal is to get off social media completely but that she’s not ready for that just yet. No shit Sherlock - you’re highly addicted to your phone! No way yoga girl is going to quit social media cold turkey anytime soon! anyway, she says that this is where Substack comes in. she wants to write and she loves the positive feedback that people get on Substack. 

Personally I think she’s just spiraling. I think that this sub as well as a lot of DM’s that she might be getting from people about her crazy antics and her scammy ways are probably getting to her to a point where she now is even entertaining the idea of leaving social media. I never thought I would see this day! I don’t think she can cope with the amount of negative DMs and the posts here in this sub. The beloved yoga girl is no longer an almighty guru that everyone looks up to. She cannot handle how people are calling her out and now she is scrambling. this kind of reminds me of the time that she was getting canceled and she ended up fleeing Aruba and running away to Sweden with her tail between her legs.

She says “ I got A LOT of really beautiful feedback from SO MANY of you, telling me thank you for sharing this way. I used to check your stories all the time because I was afraid that I would miss something. So now I know that once I see your posts for the day, that’s it. It’s like watching a show rather than me having to be online waiting for you to post all day.” I had three or four people say this to me. Ummmm..Who the hell are these people??? what is so life-changing about the stories that Rachel posts that you have to be on the edge of your seat all day long waiting for her to share and to actually feel FOMO? 😆

Then she talks about New Year’s Eve. She says “We’re not doing anything special. We just ordered lobster and king crab, and we are having champagne.” Yeah..No big deal! Lobster and champagne are considered “nothing special” in the life of little rich princess Rakel. She says “I’m also making this decadent chocolate mousse from scratch. Now, back in my CRAZY vegan days I used to make avocado mousse, and let me tell you, it’s NOT the same thing! This chocolate mouse is full of egg yolks and cream. Yumm!”

Then she starts going on about all the things that she didn’t know how to do at the beginning of the year that she is now very confident in! one of those things is the gym, and the other is taking care of bees and chickens. She admits that when she went to pick up the bees earlier this year, she was shaking while she was driving the beehive back to the farm . And that when she went to pick up the chickens, she didn’t even know what a roost was. I don’t know about you, but I don’t think that that’s something to brag about Rakel! 🤦🏻‍♀️ openly admitting that you decided to bring animals into your life that you had no fucking clue how to take care of is not a flex. And now? well now… she knows how to kill chickens 😳 

I do find it interesting that she didn’t mention the roosters and how she butchered them and made coq au vin out of them at all in this podcast! I wonder if she realized after the fact that it would not be a good idea to openly talk about how she cold bloodedly killed these innocent animals after having brought them into this world against expert advice? 😬

She said she can confidently call herself a homesteader, but she’s not going to call herself a farmer until she gets a lot more animals. She wants to get a donkey, some emus, sheep and ducks - and a baby cow. 

And then she starts talking about how this upcoming retreat is the most excited she’s EVER been to host a retreat. She says that in the past, she used to always get nervous and anxious before her retreats, but not this time! Wow - I’m sure anyone who paid to attend a retreat in Aruba must just LOVE hearing that those retreats didn’t mean as much to her. She was not excited about them the way she is about this one!

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hukny2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1hukny2/need_advice_on_pursuing_a_girl_from_church/,Need Advice On Pursuing A Girl From Church ,So there’s this girl at my church that I’ve been interested in for awhile. She’s super cute and great with kids which is a plus for me. I’ve been building a relationship with her slowly but surely. I got her number not too long ago and tbh she sucks at texting. I usually text her every so often and tell her I hope she’s having a great day. We’ll exchange a few messages and then she usually quits replying lol. It used to bug me out at first but it doesn’t really bother me anymore. Anytime I see her out in public she usually makes it a point to come say hey to me and it seems like she’s happy to see me. The other day she texted me out of the blue and asked what I was doing on the 25th. She then asked if I wanted to go to a wedding with her as her plus one. Which I was cool with because I wanted to hang out with her anyways lol. She then texted me a few days later saying she couldn’t bring me because when she RSVP she only did it for herself and forgot. Which is fine stuff happens I’m not gonna get upset over something like that. She said maybe we can go out to lunch on the 26th after church. I said that sounds good and to just let me know what she wanted to do. Idk I feel like I’m just overthinking everything but I’m not really sure how to move forward. I’m back and forth on whether or not she’s interested in me. I just want some advice on how to move forward with her. I’m definitely interested in her and want to pursue her but not really sure how to. I also don’t want to come on too strong and scare her  away. Been thinking about some nice gestures to do for her like bringing her lunch one day to work or coffee but again I don’t want to come on too strong. Any advice is welcomed at this point 😂 I’ve been out of the dating scene for about 5 years so it’s a lot trying to get back into it not knowing where to start. Spent the last 4 years just working on myself trying to become a better me. I feel like I’m in a great spot right now and want to start dating again. ,0,1736119721.0,Christian,5,0.5,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I prefer to meet people in person to get lunch or coffee to see if we click or don't. I'm 34, I have a busy life and you probably do to. I have my own hobbies like cooking, health, and watching anime.

They often say the partners we end up with are an amalgamation of characteristics of previous partners. There are things I know now that I like in a partner. I like that are -- not abrasive -- but direct. I do like direct communication and constructive criticism. I also get along well with independent thinkers, polymaths, and people that are really invested in their hobbies and interests. I also like people are kinda goofy and try to find humor in things as life can suck sometimes.

1hukmgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureOfDentistry/comments/1hukmgv/wake_up_the_dental_industry_is_sleepwalking_into/,Wake Up! The Dental Industry is Sleepwalking into Obsolescence,"  
Imagine showing up to a party in 2024 still rocking bell-bottoms and platform shoes from the '70s. That's basically the dental industry—stuck in a time warp, doing the hustle while the rest of healthcare is jamming out with tech-powered beats. (Carr, 2017)  
Dentistry is on the brink of becoming the punchline in the tech world's comedy show. Sure, our tools still sparkle, our gloves still snap, and our drills still make that terrifying sound. But technology? It's racing ahead, leaving our dental world in the dust like a cartoon character with legs spinning in place. And most of us? We're either too busy or too comfy in our recliners to notice. (Topol, 2015)  
The outcome? Frustrated patients, dentists with burnout, and a profession at risk of being the ""what not to do"" case study in tech innovation. Trust me, we don't want to be that. (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014)  
But hold your horses, don't start hyperventilating into your lab coat. We're going to tackle this one toothache at a time.  
The Innovation Deficit (Yes, It’s as Bad as It Sounds)  
Here's the harsh reality, folks: Genuine innovation in dentistry is rarer than a vegan at a barbecue. While healthcare is out there playing with AI, robots, and even 3D-printed organs, our big innovation is a new bonding agent that costs $150 a squirt. Seriously? (Schwendicke et al., 2020)  
Then there's the snake oil—courses that promise to turn you into the Steve Jobs of dentistry but only leave you with a lighter wallet and heavier regrets.   
Take 3D printing definitive restorations, for instance. It's like the industry got all excited about a new toy, only to realize it's more suited for printing novelty keychains than functional veneers. ""Oh, you thought you'd be 3D printing veneers? Bless your heart."" It's not happening, folks. (Revilla-León et al., 2021)  
Why? Because the industry is driven by what sells, not what works. It's time to demand tools that the industry will actually benefit from.  
Dental Software Is Still a Relic (And I’m Not Sorry for Saying It)  
Why in 2024 does dental software still feel like it's from the dial-up era? Imagine if Apple released a phone where sending a text required a manual and a prayer—that's our software. It's outdated, disjointed, and frankly, a bit of a laughingstock. (Kumar & Priyadarshini, 2018)  
Here's my unfiltered opinion: most dental software is terrible. And unless we start shouting for change, we'll remain stuck in the digital stone age.   
We need software that:  


* Integrates with labs without causing a communication apocalypse. (ADA, 2020)
* Automates reminders like a helpful friend, not a nagging parent. (Sittig et al., 2018)
* Analyzes data to make your practice run like a well-oiled machine. (Desai et al., 2019)
* Uses AI to make your diagnoses as precise as a sniper. (Estai et al., 2018)

Currently, we're in the dark ages here. And tech companies think we're not worth the investment because we've been too chill about it. Here's a fun fact—the dental software market could be worth billions, but we're stuck with software that feels like a high school project. (Mishra & Pandey, 2019)  
Knowledge Is Power, But Why Is It Behind Paywalls?  
The dental industry's love affair with overpriced education is legendary. Those $80,000 courses? They're like the dental equivalent of buying a yacht for a kiddie pool. It's not just bad for your bank account; it's toxic for our profession. (Tugwell & Bennett, 2016)  
Here’s a wild idea—open-source knowledge. Imagine if all that research, all those case studies, were available for everyone in the dental family. We'd be collaborating, innovating, and not just repeating the same old fillings. (Suber, 2012)  
We need less gatekeeping and more group hugs.  
Supplies Are Bleeding Us Dry  
Who here has ever looked at the price tag on dental materials and thought, ""Are they made of gold or something?"" Especially dental bonding agents, which are priced like they're the secret to eternal youth.   
Why no generics in dentistry? Why aren't we teaming up with scientists to make affordable options? We're not just saving money; we're taking control from the supply chain vampires. (Lutz, 2015)  
Tomorrow’s Dentistry Is Digital—But Will We Be Included?  
The future is coming, whether we're ready or not:  


* AI at every turn, making treatment plans as personalized as your social media feed. (Estai et al., 2018)
* Robots assisting in procedures, so your hands can stop shaking from the coffee. (Kumar, 2019)
* A supply chain that doesn't feel like you're being mugged by big business. (Gottlieb, 2020)
* Software that actually connects everything in your practice like the neural network of a sci-fi movie. (Papaspyrou et al., 2019)

The question is, will dentists be the pioneers, or will we watch from the sidelines as tech moguls dictate our future?  
Stop Sleepwalking. Start Innovating.  
We've got a choice to make. Will dentistry keep sleepwalking into the sunset, or will we wake up and start leading the charge? It's not just about staying relevant; it's about reclaiming our spot as healthcare rockstars.  
Here's how we start:  


* Get Loud: Demand better software, ethical education, and reasonable prices. (Christensen, 1997)
* Go Digital: Learn and integrate digital tools like it's your new favorite hobby. (Joda et al., 2019)
* Collaborate: Share your wisdom. Make the industry a better place for all. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
* Focus on Care: Remember, all this tech is for the people in our chairs. (Berwick, 2009)

The dental industry can't afford to be passive anymore. It's time to wake up because the future is now, and you don't want to miss the party.

Sometimes I miss her in that common possesive and ,,ex romantic partner'' way, but I realised I really miss her as a person. And idk is this weird or not but I really connected with her family too especially with her grandma and her sister. For 3 summers I was hanging out with her and her family at least once a week and often came in her house. I really liked her older sister and I saw her as friend, Me and her sister had this routine where we would drink a coffee together or chat a little bit at the terrace while my gf is doing something around the house. We were both smokers so we sould bond over it lol. I enjoyed our conversations about books, life, literature and she is really interesting person. Her grandma was one really smart and strong woman and she adored me. I literally felt with her like she is my grandma too. I just can't fucking believe that I will never see these people again in my life. I don't care if my ex girlfriend tommorow finds a new partner, I really do wish her well, for both of us. But why breakups have to be so black or white? It's literally like part of me died, all our memories died, these 3 years I spend with her were just a waste of time obviously.  so when I date someone again I will have in my mind ok- I will either marry this person or never see them again lol.

I am really type of person who could be friends with an ex- of course not every ex, but with those I really loved and went through so much together. I know we will probably never be- she lives in different city but I do genuinely miss her as a human being- not just what we did together or how I felt with her. But at the end of the day I am probably the only person who miss our relationship with this strong intensity. Neither her sister, family or her friends ever reached out to me after breakup and sad truth is this is all my perspective, and all in my head. ",1,1736119593.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I, (25M) have been dating who we will call “Linda” (28F) for 3 years. Linda and I have had a great relationship, and I truly see myself having a future with her, even despite our current issues. I’m writing this post to ask about something that I did regarding Linda and her “encounters” let’s say.

A few weeks ago, we were in our shared one bedroom apartment, she was a taking a shower, regular everyday stuff. She left her phone on the coffee table, and I looked over and saw that a contact that said Mom was texting her a bunch. It seemed extremely dire, so I brought her phone to her. She looked spooked when she saw the phone and then asked me to leave. I thought nothing of it, but when I went back into the space, I overheard her in the bathroom saying stuff like “baby” and “I’m wearing nothing” which is very weird to say to your mother in my opinion.  I asked about it but she dismissed me.

So I did some digging. Turns out that “Mom” was actually some girl that she had been hooking up with on the side. I didn’t know she liked girls, nothing wrong with that of course, but then again, she’s actively doing this while pursuing a relationship with me. I even bought her a diamond ring after saving up for a year, and I was going to propose on her birthday.

So; and here’s why be the asshole- for her birthday dinner last night, I had prepared the ultimate payback. Now Linda loves social events, very outgoing. And she’s also hinted strongly to me that she wanted a big proposal. Like a spectacle for all her friends to ogle and envy. And we both already decided to invite her family and friends to the Outback Steakhouse for a nice authentic Australian birthday dinner down under.  30 minutes before anyone arrived, I got to work. The owners were super understanding and let me do some “preparations”

Linda and her family got there first, followed by her drunk friends, and we started the evening. We got a bloomin’ onion for the table, and exchanged in pleasantries and talked like civilized folk. As the night was heading to a close, I pulled out the big finish. I got down on bended knee and started my biiiiig speech. I started with “Linda, you and I have shared some of the best days of our lives with each other- and I need to know if you would make me the happiest man on earth…. And admit to what you did.” As I finished with this, instead of a ring box, I pulled out my phone with screenshots of her and her boo’s sexts. In the dead silence I told everyone to look under their chairs, where I had placed folders containing every screenshot of incriminating evidence. In the outrage that followed, I strolled out Outback in confidence.

Now her family and friends are blasting my phone, calling me crazy for doing that to Linda on her birthday and making everyone look at the sexts. While I do feel bad about involving everyone, it was simply necessary in my eyes. AITA?

Here’s how to keep those pearly whites smiling from both sides of the drill:  
1. Cultivate a Positive Mindset:  


* Embrace Stoic Principles: Think of Stoicism as your dental cape. You can't control if Mr. Smith ate a whole bag of caramels before his appointment, but you can choose not to let it drive you bonkers. Focus on what you can control, like your reaction when he says, ""I flossed yesterday... I think."" Accept what you can’t, like the fact that some people will never understand what flossing really means (Robertson, 2010).
* Practice Gratitude: Start each day by thanking your lucky stars for the joys of dentistry. Maybe it's the thrill of a perfectly placed filling or the comedy gold from your patient's ""I only drink water"" claims while their teeth tell a different story. Gratitude shifts your focus from ""Why me?"" to ""At least I didn't drill into my thumb today"" (Emmons & McCullough, 2003).
* Celebrate Small Victories: Did you make it through the morning without spilling coffee on your scrubs? Victory! Did a patient actually compliment your work? Double victory! These little wins add up, making your day feel like less of a root canal (Achor, 2010).

2. Prioritize Physical and Mental Well-being:  


* Incorporate Mindfulness: After peering into someone's mouth for hours, you need a mental reset. A few minutes of deep breathing or meditation can turn ""I can't handle one more patient"" into ""I've got this."" It's like mental floss for your brain (Kabat-Zinn, 1990).
* Take Breaks: Ever tried to drill a tooth while your back feels like it's hosting a circus? Take breaks to stretch, walk, or just stare at something that’s not teeth. It's preventive maintenance for your sanity (Trougakos & Hideg, 2009).
* Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle: Eat well, sleep better, and move your body. Because nothing says ""I love my job"" like having the energy to do it without fantasizing about early retirement (Warburton et al., 2006).

3. Foster a Supportive and Collaborative Environment:  


* Teamwork: Turn your team into a well-oiled machine, not one where everyone's secretly wanting to be the oil. Promote open communication so that when someone says, ""The X-ray machine is acting up,"" it doesn't sound like they're speaking in code (Salas et al., 2008).
* Delegate Effectively: Empower your team to take on tasks, so you're not the one stuck faxing insurance claims when you could be perfecting smiles. It's like delegating flossing to your patients; sometimes, they just need the right encouragement (Yukl, 2012).
* Embrace Technology: Let AI and digital tools take the grunt work. Imagine having software that does everything but actually clean the teeth. More time for patient smiles, less time wrestling with paperwork (Schwendicke et al., 2020).

4. Nurture a Passion for Learning:  


* Continuing Education: The dental world changes faster than a patient's story about their last meal. Keep learning to keep loving what you do. Whether it's mastering a new tech or just understanding why people think ""sugar-free"" means ""cavity-free"" (ADA, 2020).
* Embrace New Challenges: Don't just stick to what you know; try new procedures. It's like upgrading from a manual toothbrush to an electric one – suddenly, everything's more exciting (Dweck, 2006).

Remember: Your well-being is the secret sauce to your practice's success. When you're happy and healthy, your patients feel it, your team thrives, and your coffee tastes better. So, invest in yourself, because a dentist who doesn't dream of desert islands is one who's truly thriving.

Hello! I need help trying to understand how to correctly use the steamer on my espresso machine. I know im doing it wrong because it is screaming like a banshee and my cat absolutely hates it and actually attacked me for it (hes blind and easily scared, hes never bitten me before so it broke my heart to see him that spooked & i had to go to urgent care for the bite!) also i must add that my milk pitchers havent come in yet but i was too excited and just used a mug so Im sure thats was not helpful. I use to work at a small owned coffee shop years and years ago and i remember *some* of my training but the steamer is where im still confused. Id appreciate the help!

The stations echoes absorb the sound of my footsteps

I’ve only just arrived at the empty corridor

The silence breathing in my exhales

 

The dim flicker of lights 

Like a faint mirror of my heartbeat

On off on off, I wish they could decide for me

 

It’s July 31st, but only just.

The clock above the platform ticks louder now.

A constant reminder that August is a few hours away now

 

The bench is cold under me,

Who knew I could find this kind of coldness in the July Heat

 

I’m ready I tell myself

Enjoying the solitude 

 

I’ve packed nothing

I’m left with shadows and ideas of what should have been

 

My hands free of all belongings

I’ve left everything but the fragments of conversations 

Replying like old greatest hits vinyl’s 

 

But I still hear them—

their voices in the tunnels,

their laughter pressed into the walls.

 

The stillness of minutes before midnight 

makes my pulse jump

of maybe it’s the hum the rail’s stir

I can’t tell the difference anymore.

 

I lean back. Arms folded

Eyes half-closed, half-open—

The lights now mimicking the sun

Or is the sun mimicking the lights?

 

A soft voice calling me first

Soft and inviting

The kind that makes the corners of my mouth widen

The kind I’d follow until the sunset

 

Then the flicker of eyes

Brown, blue, green

Too many to focus on

Too many to forget

 

I don’t look, but I feel them.

Filling spaces. Begging me back.

 

I hear them—

the ones I let go of too soon,

the ones I held on to for too long.

 

The memories we shared

 

The ones we should have made

 

Conversations filled with laughter 

Conversations filled with anything but laughter

 

The Conversations rise and fall.

Their voices thread through the corridor, reverberating through the concrete walls

 

A joke I took too seriously

A question I never asked.

 

I grip the edge of the bench,

Remind myself of where I am

My hands heavy with emptiness

I let them drop to my sides

 

The crowd thickens.

Clothing distorts, faces blur.

I keep my eyes ahead,

Remind myself that August approaches

 

but I see them anyway.

 

The crowd starts to thicken.

Voices murmuring—fractured, overlapping.

I make a slight exhale of exhaustion

 

 

A hand softly brushes past me.

And I lean into it

 

 

A whisper tickles my ear.

I can’t make out the words,

but I feel their shape—lovely and warm

 

I try to stand, but the crowd is making its way to me 

Eyes planting me to the hard bench

Mouths asking me to stay still

Hands reaching for mine

They’re whispers steadily gaining volume

 

**Stay.**

**Wait.**

**Please don’t go.**

**There’s more for us here.**

 

A lump in my throat begins to form

The air feels thicker now.

July’s humidity in full effect.

 

My eyes now trying to make out the kinds of footwear these shadows are wearing

A tired smile escapes from me.

 

A distant screech from the incoming train echoes. 

And then—

 

Slowly silence spreads.

 

The crowd backs away.

or maybe they disappear completely.

I don’t know, and I don’t mind.

 

Because suddenly, it’s just a pair of black boots.

 

Standing there,

My eyes trace a golden figure

still and sharp in the flickering light—

like they’ve been waiting too.

 

My breath catches involuntarily.

As It always did when those boots were around.

 

I look up.

Perfect upper lip, deep eyes that long for connection

just as I remember.

 

I swallow.

 

**“There you are.”**

 

A perfect grin. 

The kind that will stay with me forever. 

 

**“A little late...as always.”**

 

A quick laugh between us.

 

**“…You’re leaving.”**

 

Spoken with a hint of sad shyness.

 

**“I have to.”**

 

The words tickle like feathers.

 

They take a step closer.

Not enough to close the distance,

just enough to make me feel it.

 

*The clock ticks.*

*11:58.*

*Then 11:59.*

 

**“You know you don’t have to—”**

 

I stop them with a look.

 

**“I know.”**

 

And I do.

I don’t have to leave.

In fact, no one wants me to.

But I want to.

 

**“I’m not angry.”**

 

Memories of laugher flash between us.

Summers rolling in grassy fields.

Winters in apartments with warm coffee.

 

**“I…”**

 

The hum of the rails grows louder.

Hesitation creeping in.

 

**“I…”**

Wish you were really here to stop me. No.

You wouldn’t do that. You’re just a ghost now. 

 

The beam of a headlight illuminating a dark tunnel.

 

**“I just can’t stay.”**

 

They nod.

Lips bitten; hands clenched.

 

**“I hope…”**

 

They stop.

I stand and make my way past them.

Standing on the empty platform.

 

**“I hope you find what you’re looking for. I really do.”**

 

The words land at my back.

I let the words sit there between us,

like luggage I’m not taking with me.

 

**“Yeah..”**

I let the conversation with the ghost of you fade.

Would I have the strength to leave if you were here?

Doesn’t matter. You’re not.

 

**“Take care.”**

A whisper that disappears before they do

Your ghost can’t hold me.

Can’t stop the clock

 

 

I wipe away the single tear that welled up. 

And let out a melancholy smile.

 

And then-

the rails scream,

the lights flood the station

 

I’ve been waiting for this.

Haven’t I?

 

I step closer to the edge 

The air rushing toward me now.

 

**“You’ll be okay.”**

I say to myself more a prayer than statement.

 

The light spills in, washing away shadows, while the rails stir—vibrations rising like a held breath.

 

The air shifts—

Lighter now.

It has arrived

 

The train doesn’t ask me to think about this

It doesn’t ask me to stay

It just opens its doors and waits

 

I step forward

The doors close behind me

A quick glance at the clock

Okay, so I received a TON of DMs, and unfortunately, all of them said that *I* am the AH. 

I don’t think you people know how this works, lol.

So, Zach came over to my (his?) apartment, and demanded to swap back. I tried to calm him down, though I don’t think I did a very good job at it (I may have been a tad condescending to him by asking him “What’s wrong? Do you miss having a penis?” 🤷‍♀️) and he was adamant that we swap back immediately.

So, I pulled out the big guns. I took out his phone and began to call Crystal. The look he made with my old face was hilarious. He was completely shook. I told him that he needed to relax or I’ll tell Crystal everything. That seemed to do the trick, since he took a big step back and raised his hands up (as if he had a weapon pointed at him 🤣) and asked if we can just talk about this. Perfect.

So, I lay out my offer to keep his body another week and he reluctantly agreed. However, I made it clear that he’s really going to have to pretend to be ME, and not make me look bad, lest my reputation suffers. 

With gritted teeth he agreed. I thanked him for his willingness to lend me his body but he replied that I didn’t leave him a choice and left. That’s a bit of a stretch. I mean, he does have a choice. And he chose to let me have his body. He doesn’t need to act like a victim here. I’m not a monster 🙄

So, anyways, the next day I got to hang out with Crystal. And she asks if we wanted to get some coffee. And I know the perfect place!

We head over to my coffee shop where Zach is working. He sees us standing there and is clearly a nervous wreck. Poor guy.

He comes over from behind the counter to say hi, but his attention is really on Crystal. He asks her how she’s been and what she’s been up to. It was like he was trying to start a dialogue with her, and all she wanted was some coffe. It’s like, read the room guy 😆 So I had to talk over him by saying, “Uh, yeah, I think we’ll just get the Pecan Pie Lattes..” and I could tell he was put off by that. He then fixed his face to a smile and said “sure! Coming right up.” He made the coffee (though we had to wait a bit since there were other guests. I could have gone MUCH faster than him 🤣 (Maybe it’s a generational thing? Young folks don’t seem to want to work anymore 🤷‍♀️). 

Anyways, I spent the day with Crystal and then went to the show. All was well, until I was backstage and saw Zach talking with the director. I know it’s rude to eavesdrop, BUT, he’s in MY body, so the conversation technically involves me. And as I got closer, I heard Zach say, “Why darling, you’re the most handsomest man in the world..”

He said WHAT? I was spinning. Was he messing around with that director? In my body? Is this his way to get “pay back” after he accepted my deal? After ALL I did for him? Getting him this awesome role. Making HIM look good? Well, that’s about all I could handle. 

After the show, I met up with Crystal and told her everything. EVERYTHING. And boy, was she upset. At first she didn’t beleive me, but then once she realized I must be telling the truth, she bolted out of the apartment and drove off. There wasn’t any going back now. I called Zach to let him know that his actions brought us here. To say he was angry is an understatement.

He asked why I would ever do such a thing, and I told him what I overheard backstage when he was talking to the director, and that the director had better kept his hands off my body, or there will be a harassment suit filed on him so fast it’ll make his head spin. 

There was a slight pause. Then, “That was a LINE from the play, you FUCKING IDIOT! The Director was giving me a line note, and I was repeating it back to him! Are you fucking serious?!”

Oopsies.

But I mean, how was I supposed to know that? All the lines sound the same. I just focus on MY lines. Ha. Anyways, he demands we swap back. He wasn’t going to play along anymore. Ugh. Fine. His life was pretty boring to be honest.

So, he came to his apartment and met me in the middle of the room. He pulled my phone out of my purse and demanded that I pull out his phone. I did, but found it was dead. He was about to blow his top again. So I charged it and while we waited as he just sat there fuming, asking himself how he’s supposed to fix this and that he never should have trusted me. 

Um, yeah..hi. I just got you the role of your dreams. And you got to have my awesome life for almost two months. AND you now have great legs. 

Why are men never satisfied ? 

So, the phone charges and I open the app. We count to three and he smashes the button on the screen so hard I’d thought he’d break my nail off. 

But…nothing happens. Suddenly, and error message appears telling us that the system is down and that we’d need to reach out to tech support. A chat box opens up on his phone and a swap app representative named Sanjay asks what he can do to assist.

Oh boy. This did not go well. Zach was so exasperated. He grabbed the phone and began typing. And typing. And typing some more. Then he finally received a reply stating the app is experiencing technical issues, and won’t be operating for at least another day. 

Zach looked like he was gonna cry. I told him that I can call Crystal in the meantime and smooth it out. He screamed “Don’t you dare!” At me. As if I’m the one that’s gonna make it worse 🙄

So, that’s where we’re at. What do you think? Am I STILL the AH here?",5,1736118749.0,BodySwapMemes,3,0.86,False

Hello guys, 

Two weeks ago, I made an attempt to a color wheel but I realized quite quickly it was quite bad. I posted it with another account in here 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Armypainter/s/sgAuo9D0SO


As a fellow miniature painter, I’ve often found myself spending way too much time figuring out the best color schemes and wondering which colors would work well together. That’s what inspired me to create this color wheel specifically tailored to The Army Painter’s Fanatic range.

Here’s how it works:
	•	The wheel is structured around the flexible triad system of the Fanatic range, making it easy to mix and match colors for your miniatures.
	•	Outer colors are the most vivid, while shades closer to the center have added black, white, or gray to create depth.
	•	Intermediate colors (like turquoise and teal) are blends of neighboring hues.

I designed this to help miniature painters like me save time and find harmonious matches with ease. I’d love to hear your thoughts on it!

It is not without flaws, and I realize there are improvements to be made (different font sizes to make it into the hexagons for example)

If you’re interested, feel free to download it and give it a try. Your support (a follow, feedback, or even buying me a coffee!) would mean a lot—it helps me work on improved versions, explore other ranges and brands, and support the creative projects I share on my personal page (miniature painting & worldbuilding).

Let me know what you think, and if you have suggestions for improvements, I’d be thrilled to 
hear them!

my loose plan is to go to grad school and do a joint masters/phd program so i can pursue psychiatric work. but in the meantime, i want to find a part time job in a different industry. i’m burnt out with coffee shop work. and i have had some retail jobs too — retail is not for me. i’m an introvert who really loves solo work. customer service is exhausting, and i’ve done it for so long that i’d love to try something else, but i don’t know what. to be honest, i have some doubts about my future plans with psychiatric work. my dream job would be owning a cat rescue. i would truly be doing what i love, but i have no idea how i’d start and know that that job doesn’t even make money (to my knowledge).

anyways, i got a little off topic. but if anyone has any suggestions for work i can do now in school that aligns with what i mentioned above, i’d appreciate it so much 🫶 thank you in advance. ",4,1736118356.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

## Introduction

The Rancilio Silvia PID espresso machine stands as a popular choice among home baristas and coffee enthusiasts seeking a reliable and high-performing machine.  Its reputation precedes it, built on a combination of robust build quality, precise temperature control thanks to its PID system, and the ability to produce consistently excellent espresso shots. However, like any sophisticated machine, understanding its nuances is key to unlocking its full potential. This guide will delve into the Rancilio Silvia PID, addressing common questions and concerns to help you determine if it's the right espresso machine for you.  We'll cover everything from its design and temperature control features to maintenance and troubleshooting, drawing on user reviews and expert opinions to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Design and Build Quality: A Commercial Feel at Home

The Rancilio Silvia boasts a design that's both aesthetically pleasing and durable. Its commercial-grade look and feel immediately set it apart from many consumer-level espresso machines.  The chassis is constructed from robust materials, contributing to its impressive longevity. This isn't a flimsy plastic machine; the Rancilio Silvia feels substantial and well-built, promising years of reliable service.  The weighty portafilter, mirroring those used in professional settings, further enhances this impression of quality and contributes to consistent extraction.  While its footprint is relatively compact, its solid construction suggests a machine built to last, justifying its position among the best espresso machines under $1000.

## Temperature Control: The Power of PID

The heart of the Rancilio Silvia PID's performance lies in its namesake: the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) temperature controller.  Unlike simpler espresso machines that rely on basic thermostats, the PID system continuously monitors and adjusts the boiler temperature, ensuring precise and stable heat throughout the brewing process. This translates to more consistent espresso extraction, resulting in a richer, more flavorful shot with the perfect crema.  The difference between a PID-controlled machine and a non-PID machine is significant, particularly for those who value consistency and precision in their espresso making.  This ability to maintain a stable temperature eliminates the temperature fluctuations experienced with non-PID machines, a crucial factor for achieving repeatable results.

## Key Features and Performance: Beyond Temperature Control

While the PID system is a standout feature, the Rancilio Silvia offers several other crucial elements that contribute to its overall performance.  The steam wand, while requiring some practice to master, delivers powerful steam ideal for creating velvety microfoam for latte art.  The low-profile drip tray keeps the countertop clean and tidy.  The portafilter, as mentioned, is a robust, commercial-grade component. However, users should be aware of the potential for over-extraction if the coffee grounds aren't properly distributed, often leading to channeling.  The machine's single boiler design means that you need to 'temperature surf' – allowing the boiler to cool down between brewing and steaming – which some users find inconvenient.  However, many consider this a small price to pay for the quality of the espresso produced.

## Common Issues and Solutions: Troubleshooting the Rancilio Silvia

Despite its high quality, the Rancilio Silvia is not without its quirks.  One common issue is the hex bolt on the portafilter, which some users find difficult to manage, leading to inconsistent tamping and uneven extraction.  While some users opt for modding the machine by replacing the hex bolt,  this should only be attempted by those with mechanical aptitude.  Another common challenge is mastering temperature surfing.  This involves allowing the boiler to cool slightly between pulling a shot and frothing milk. Careful monitoring of the temperature with a thermometer can alleviate this.  Finally, understanding the nuances of grind size adjustment is critical, as the Rancilio Silvia is sensitive to even slight variations.

## Maintenance and Care: Extending the Life of Your Investment

Regular maintenance is crucial for prolonging the lifespan of your Rancilio Silvia and ensuring consistent performance.  Regular descaling (every 3-6 months, depending on water hardness) is essential to prevent mineral buildup and maintain optimal heating efficiency.  Daily cleaning involves wiping down the exterior and emptying the drip tray.  Regular backflushing is also highly recommended to prevent coffee oils and grounds from accumulating within the group head.  Proper maintenance not only enhances the machine's longevity but also contributes to the quality of your espresso.

## Audience Feedback and Reviews: A Balanced Perspective

Online reviews of the Rancilio Silvia PID paint a picture of a machine that, while demanding a certain level of dedication and learning curve, is highly rewarding for serious coffee enthusiasts.  Experienced baristas often praise its ability to produce consistently high-quality espresso, highlighting the precision of the PID and the robust build quality.  However, novice users may find the initial learning curve challenging, particularly regarding temperature surfing and achieving consistent tamping.  It's important to acknowledge that mastering this machine requires practice and patience.


## Conclusion: Is the Rancilio Silvia PID Right for You?

The Rancilio Silvia PID espresso machine represents a significant investment, but for those dedicated to crafting exceptional espresso at home, it's a worthy contender. Its combination of robust build, precise temperature control, and commercial-grade features makes it a top performer.  While it demands a learning curve and requires diligent maintenance, the rewards—consistent, high-quality espresso—are significant.  If you're a serious coffee enthusiast willing to invest the time and effort, the Rancilio Silvia PID could very well be your perfect shot.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Does the Rancilio Silvia PID require a specific type of water?**

A: Using filtered water is highly recommended to prevent mineral buildup and scale formation, prolonging the lifespan of your machine and maintaining optimal performance.

**Q: How difficult is it to clean and maintain the Rancilio Silvia PID?**

A: While it requires regular cleaning and descaling, the process is relatively straightforward.  Following the manufacturer's instructions and engaging in regular backflushing will ensure a clean and well-maintained machine.

**Q: Can I use pre-ground coffee with the Rancilio Silvia PID?**

A: While possible, using freshly ground coffee beans will significantly enhance the quality of your espresso.  Pre-ground coffee tends to lose its aroma and flavor more quickly.

**Q: Is the Rancilio Silvia PID suitable for a small business?**

A: While capable of producing a high volume of espresso shots, the Rancilio Silvia PID is primarily designed for home use.  For high-volume commercial applications, a more robust commercial-grade machine may be more suitable.  However, for a small cafe with limited throughput, it could be a viable option.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

So confused.","Hey, I'm feeling a little lost about this situation. I've posted here a bunch of times before, and there's yet another confusing thing in my love life, what a shocker, right?

2 years ago, I lived in Texas, in a place I really did not like, I was only 17-18 and I felt really insecure with myself and didn't have much to do other than university. I used to go on VRChat for hours nearly every single night (a virtual reality game wherein you meet people) and got attached to a lot of people and made friends I could have never had IRL. I saw an ad for a VRChat dating service and I went for it and expected nothing of it.

I ended up matching with this really nice guy from the Netherlands, and since I was learning and could speak a bit of Dutch, it was nice, but we connected on a lot of levels other than just that. I really liked him. We spoke daily for about 2 months before an argument/disagreement led us to not speaking for 2 years. 

That was until slightly before Christmas this year, and 1,5 years before this I had moved to the Netherlands permanently, until I added him on my new account, he actually remembered me and we have been texting obsessively and even video called, and we've only spoken Dutch during this whole duration. I am so infatuated with this guy, he's so sweet, funny, way kinder than I remembered, and absolutely not bad-looking, I fell for him so quickly... 

We shared really personal things, we've had many conversations about sexual compatibility, emotions, we've flirted incessantly (well, he's mostly been flirting with me) and the distrust and uncertainty he felt for me in the beginning, I can feel it going. Let's be honest, guys, if he asked me to give it up, I'd ask for a time and a place. I'd like to mention that we're both sort of demi (i.e. basically no sexual/romantic interest until there's a good level of connection).

What's the catch? He suggested we meet up for a terrasje (going to sit on a terrace with coffee and such and could be interpreted as a date), and then eventually it became an actual date. We scheduled a day to meet up and that day was today. I was so nervous, but he was every bit as sweet and handsome and genuinely caring as he was online, but I had never been on a date before, and this, added on top of the fact that I had actually pretty strong feelings for him, meant I was an absolute nervous wreck and could barely handle talking with him, made MUCH worse by the fact that my written comprehension of his language is great, but I have a fair bit trouble speaking Dutch (not with accent, just with word recollection). 

We ended up going to a bookstore, reading manga together, chatting, and it was lovely in theory except for the fact that I could *basically not talk to him.* Somehow, he still said he enjoyed it a bit, and mentioned a few times that there would be a ""next time.""

So I do the totally sane FFHK (me) move and then sent him a message online after apologising profusely for my issues with the language and ruining the atmosphere and inadvertently wording it in such a way that I basically friendzoned him, and I can tell his feelings are hurt. There's practically nothing I would like more than to see him again and to actually feel comfortable enough to talk with this practical dream-boat of a man, he liked me, probably still does, we actually hit it off, I'm like, actually maybe desirable to a person like him and that's fucking insane to me.

I asked him if he thought that message sounded like I didn't like him anymore, and he said yes. I just wanted to give him an ""out"" so he could maybe find someone or something better.

Anyways, I fucked up a first dream opportunity to get to know someone I'm really interested in and whom actually really like(s)(d) me, all because I couldn't control my anxiety and my tendency to blow up relationships for nothing. Please tell me what I can do here, if you have any advice. I really, so desperately want to know if there's anything I can do to convince him that I really care for him, and don't want to end the friendship again over a single argument again.",2,1736118147.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

I’m eating super clean and trying eat whole/real foods as much as possible. 

*GAME CHANGER : Natural probiotics and fiber thru REAL FOOD*

-Kimchi + sauerkraut (great probiotics for your gut). I get 2 huge tubs of each from Costco and try to finish both every 2 weeks. All the good bacteria you need!!! 

- Kefir (probiotics) I get the RAW milk one from Sprouts. 

-Greek yogurt (high protein + great for gut) 

-Celery
-Carrots
-Cucumber (I try to do this 3 veggie plate at lunch along with whatever I’m having, very high in fiber!!)

-Chia seeds + oats - natural high fiber foods (I prep a chia seed and oats pudding for breakfast with berries) 

-3 servings of fruit per day (berries/apples/pomegranate) These are the fruits I choose cause of the antioxidants in berries and poms 

- A shot of ginger, lemon and ACV as soon as I wake up on an empty stomach 

-Sip on beef bone broth instead of my morning coffee

Since I’ve incorporated these in my daily diet absolutely no problems. Also, they are healthy foods in general whether you have constipation or not. 
Even if you can’t do all of it highly recommend Soaked chia seeds and celery. Almost impossible to have constipation with these 2.

Most of it was so random. It was about I guess a fair at my school. There was a point where I was really tired and at the other side of the room. I was surrounded by two of my friends and two guys I've been crushing on.

 One of my friends took me by the arm, and we walked across the street to a coffee shop (?) He said he would buy me something if I could do something for him, so I agreed. He asked me to confess (?) To my crush, which I then responded that i already did, and he knows i like him already.

 The thing is, i only confessed to one of those guys in real life, but the one i was thinking about at the time i only confessed to in a dream I had last night.

[After some events] I ran out crying and got back to the school where my crush was sitting on the steps. I ran to him and just sobbed in his arms (now covered in way less paint for some reason). we hugged for a while, and he told me he thought about it and he did like me. We held hands on the steps for a little bit, and then he wiped some tears (and paint) off of my face and kissed me. I chuckled a little, and then we walked back into the school while holding hands.

That's basically all the important parts, but oh my gosh, the whiplash i got after waking up!!! I hate it!!!

The Truth About Diabetes ""Cures""

Despite numerous claims, there is no scientifically proven cure for diabetes. Management is possible through:
- Medical treatments
- Lifestyle modifications
- Comprehensive healthcare approach

Conclusion

While Dr. Oz has brought attention to alternative health approaches, there is no definitive cure for diabetes that he or anyone else has discovered. Patients should always prioritize professional medical advice, evidence-based treatments, and comprehensive healthcare strategies.

The most effective path forward involves working closely with healthcare professionals, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and staying informed about the latest scientifically validated diabetes management techniques.

People with diabetes deserve hope and support – but this must come from reliable, evidence-based sources that prioritize their long-term health and well-being.

1hujwk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hujwk4/dating_a_shy_work_colleage_in_her_30s/,Dating a (shy) work colleage in her 30s,"I met a woman during a project at work. We talked like 20 times between meetings for up to 5 minutes over a span of a couple months. We are both in our thirties, she seems like a traditional woman and looking long-term (as am I).

Because of the work environment, I didn't ask many personal questions, but I cared about her projects and personally supported her when she needed it, she did the same. I wasn't her direct boss, but her admiration was clear. Now that the project is over, I thanked her and asked her out and she agreed. There is no possibility of working together again, there are no problems about that.

During these months she was shy and reserved (in terms of words, but strong eye contact), but I felt shared interest from the beginning. Maybe A) it was just because of the work environment, B) she is really shy or C) she had bad experiences and didn't open up much.

At the same time, I don't have much experience in dating since I have been very focused on my professional career. I assume she already noticed that, still, she is pretty special so I took the initiative and she agreed.

The point is, I have a date with her, there is mutual trust and understanding in a work environment, but I still don't know much about her personally. **My lack of experience dating (but not lack of confidence) and her apparent shyness could make things difficult even if there is mutual interest.**

My plan is to meet her in the afternoon near her office for coffee and a walk in a park. 1h to 2h max. Something short and gentle to process the transition and build anticipation for the next date. Transitioning from work to personal, light touching and a soft kiss seems like a success. I don't know if that plan could be boring, but I don't want to rush things.

**I assume a beautiful woman in her mid 30s will have wide experience and (perhaps) high expectations, but I don't expect fireworks on that first date, to me, the connection on a personal level is the most important part.**

**Any advice on this plan or the situation (reading the situation and her shyness) would be appreciated.** Otherwise you can wish me luck :D.",1,1736117732.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
