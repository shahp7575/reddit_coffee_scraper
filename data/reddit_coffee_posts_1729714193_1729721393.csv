1gamt6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1gamt6f/not_really_sure_what_to_do/,Not really sure what to do,"Hi (after writing this i realized how much my words are everywhere so i apologize in advance)

Okay so I got diagnosed backed in August of this year with ADHD (inattentive type) and everything makes so much more sense now.

Since maybe 2 weeks ago, I've gotten into the swing of doing things that are supposedly good for both my ADHD and depression. I started eating lots more protein (literally more grams than how much I weigh, so its been a lot of eating), walking more (enough for me to get my heart racing apparently, was not expecting that part of college haha) and drinking a lot of green tea.

So the reason as to why I'm making this post is because...I guess I just feel lost? I just want to know if there is anything else I can add to my routines to help more with my ADHD and depression that have worked great with you guys. My medicine does help a bunch, but I also want to do these types of things not only to I guess ""boost"" the medicine, but for also when the medicine wears off (which for me might be quicker than what is supposed to happen). While I do feel like the things I mentioned above have helped at least a bit, I just still feel like my depression and ADHD are consuming me. I want to feel happy to do something again so so bad. I used to drink coffee because it would make me feel warm and a little happy at the very beginning, but then I realized lately it was making my anxiety skyrocket. Not sure why it took so long for me to realize that, its literally something wellknown. ",1,1729721223.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

For years, healthy eating and regular exercise seemed like distant goals. Growing up, a diet rich in processed foods and sugary drinks was the norm, thanks to my parents' busy schedules. As I matured, the weight began to pile on. By college, I found myself at my heaviest, tipping the scales at 300 pounds.

The turning point came when I entered the workforce. With a newfound sense of responsibility, I embarked on a fitness journey. Initially, I focused on cardio and strength training. While I saw some progress, hitting a plateau and struggling with unhealthy habits became a challenge.

It wasn't until last year that I decided to make a significant lifestyle change. I swapped sugary drinks for healthier alternatives like sparkling water, tea, and coffee. My diet underwent a transformation as well, with a focus on whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and fiber. I also made a conscious effort to reduce my intake of processed foods, excess salt, and sugary snacks.

To complement my dietary changes, I established a consistent exercise routine. My workouts included walking, core exercises, weightlifting, and various strength training moves. As I continued to push myself, I noticed a gradual transformation in my body and overall well-being.

Today, I've shed 110 pounds and am feeling stronger and more confident than ever. While my journey is ongoing, I'm proud of the progress I've made and am committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

WDT'd the powder in the portafilter and tamped it with my Bomber spring loaded tamper. The same way I have done for the past 2 to 4 months. When I turned on the Cellini the pump pressure went to 9-10 bar just like the day before but this time NOTHING came out...maybe a drip or 2 but there wasn't the nice flow I usually see. After 20 seconds I shut it down. Dumped the portafilter out and started over with beans from a brand new bag...and got the same results. So I loosened the grinder from 4.5ish to 7 and reground some new beans. This time I got my usual 36 grams out but it took about 40 seconds.

That afternoon I ran cleaner through the grinder. Brushed and vacuumed the grinder out. I pulled the mushroom off the E61 looking for signs of scale and there was nothing. I put the portafilter on the E61 with NO coffee in it and ran the pump and of course water came out.

I backed the grinder off to 9 and that gave me a shot in 10 seconds. I turned it down to 8.5 and got my shot in about 25 seconds.

So what changed? Is the pump trying to call it quits? The pressure gauge says the pump is putting out 9-10 bar. I wouldn't think the grinder would change that dramatically overnight. I've examined the burs and the inside of the grinder looking for anything odd but so far I don't see a reason for the change. I was ready to remove the burs just to see if some coffee somehow got under the burs but I haven't done that yet. What strikes me as odd is even with a new bag of beans the same thing happened which I think tells me it's not the coffee.

I work from 8:30-3:30 and go to bed between 9:30 and 10:30 every night. 

The amount of sleep is not an issue, I find myself feeling more productive at work and more energetic with the amount of sleep I currently get than getting more hours of sleep. The issue I'm having though, is how can I tell myself that it's time to wake up once my 5am alarm goes off?

I don't wake up groggy, actually I'm awake before my alarm goes off by a couple hours but fall right back asleep anyway, then when my alarm does go off it wakes me up and I feel good, but I have the urge to go back to sleep. I literally fight myself to get out of bed. 

The reason why I want to actually wake up at 5am is only so I can read and drink coffee without distracting the wife. And kind of like a way to tell myself ""hey, good morning man, it's time to earn that money and have a good day"". 

It's not really a motivation thing, either. I have a notepad beside my bed with a checklist of things I want to do before morning.

I recently joined the HR department, as my background in teaching/training translated well to our new L&D department (was offered to me, not an issue of me missing sales goals).

The first three weeks were like a slow boil with my boss, who seemed to vibrate with frustration every time we interacted. He is L&D pro and I am a great coach and presenter but not up to speed on all elearning anything because I have been in sales.

Cue the third week and he requested a check-in where he said I had been argumentative, that I had resented having to report to him, was gaslighting him when I offered a different perspective, and was completely out of line regarding our mission and value statements. Think coffee. We are nice people at this company. I advised the department head of the events and he set a meeting for the three of us the next week. Then he canceled, saying he wanted us to work it out without him and... I am still employed even tho I said Nope. Not without a 3rd party. 

So dept head chose to let it ride and it's been months of me on eggshells bc I still interact with him. Today I talked to the head about how uncomfortable it is and he said he thought and thought about it but determined it was best for him to stay uninvolved. 

I see the writing but will you help me sound it out? He is a completely ineffective leader AND I think am protected bc I documented what happened BUT I need to GTFO the bus asap, yes? ",1,1729720702.0,AskHR,0,1.0,False

Yet, we kinda take it for granted. I got tired of the iffy taste from tap water and decided to give the **Bluevua RO100ROPOT-Lite** a shot. Spoiler alert: it's compact, easy to set up, and yes, the water is *legit* tasty.

# What Makes It Cool?

First off, if you're in a small space like me—think apartment or maybe a tiny office kitchen—this thing's a space-saver. It’s small enough to fit on your counter without making you rearrange your entire kitchen setup. Plus, no plumbing skills required. Seriously, it’s plug-and-play. Just fill it with water, hit the button, and you’re golden.

# Filtration Magic

The Bluevua doesn’t mess around with the filtration either. We’re talking reverse osmosis, UV light, and some fancy remineralization stuff that removes 99.99% of all the nasties (chlorine, fluoride, lead—you name it). The result? Water that actually tastes like water, not a science experiment. The first time I used it, I was like, “Wait, why does this taste so much better?”

And for anyone worried about “is it fast?”—yup, it’s quick. You won’t be waiting forever to fill up your water bottle.

# The Downsides (Because Nothing’s Perfect)

Look, no product is flawless. This thing does waste some water (about 50% of what you put in), so if you’re super eco-conscious, that’s a thing to think about. Also, it’s not NSF-certified yet, which could matter if you’re big on official certifications. Oh, and the carafe is kinda fragile—careful with that thing, especially if you’ve got clumsy hands like me.

# Real Talk: Is It Worth It?

If you’re down for a compact, no-fuss, plug-and-play filter that delivers cleaner, tastier water, the **Bluevua RO100ROPOT-Lite** is worth checking out. Sure, it's a bit pricier than some other options, but the quality and convenience balance it out. Plus, if you live in a small space and don’t want a massive system taking over your kitchen, this one’s a winner.

Would I recommend it? Yep. It's not perfect, but honestly, no regrets here. Let’s just say my coffee’s never tasted better, and that’s a win in my book.

The best salesperson at that company.

Why do great salespeople make so much money?

It’s simple. They tolerate the discomfort of being rejected.

Ultimately, making the sale comes down to picking up the phone over and over again and not being afraid of rejection…because you’ll get a lot of it.

Rejections sucks. I’ve been hung up on more times than I can count when cold calling self storage facilities to source deals.

I’ve been laughed at on calls with potential investors. I’ve had folks tell me we’ll never make money and that we should find something else to do.

Get used to it.

Because sales is a numbers game, pure and simple.

Even if your close rate is only 2%, if you can push through 100 calls a day, that’s two new customers every day.

If it takes you a month or even two months to make those calls and you’re gaining just two customers over a much longer time frame, you won’t be growing fast enough, and it’s game over.

The key is consistency. Your job is to cast a wide enough net so that you can find the right people. The people who want to buy from you or work with you or sell to you or invest with you.

You sometimes have to go from coffee to coffee, dinner table to dinner table or Zoom call to Zoom call to find the right match.

You have to wake up every day and dedicate time to sales just like you dedicate time to brushing your teeth. Even if you feel uncomfortable at first, even if you dread it, it has to be automatic.

You must embrace the uncomfortable feeling of rejection and try to make the sale happen anyway.

My real estate journey started with a world of rejection.

I met with over 100 investors before I filled my first deal. Many of them laughed at my experience level, the industry, and my pitch in general.

I also met with 10+ banks who were potential lenders for that first real estate project. They turned me down for a myriad of reasons, many similar to the reasons the investors turned me down.

You don’t have the experience. What makes you think you can build a building from the ground up? How can you operate it?

You’ve never done self storage before. The real estate market is about to crash. That site you picked is horrible.

We eventually found six people who invested $500,000 and one bank that would lend us $1.7 million.

I was 26 years old, and I learned a valuable lesson:

With confidence and enough tries, you can sell anything.

But it is hard. My hands would sweat before every meeting. I’d get a lump in my throat. I’d get anxiety. I wouldn’t want to walk in the door or pick up the phone or log on to the Zoom call. The fear of rejection is real. It hurts to get told no in person when you are trying to make a big, bold move.

Over time, the investor meetings became more natural. The bankers began to feel my confidence. During employee interviews, I got better at selling people on my vision and convincing them to trust me to guide the ship.

That’s what it’s all about. To master sales you must smile and be confident, embrace the rejection, and get comfortable being uncomfortable.

5 tips for sales:

Here's a few more tactics that will help you sell and close more.

# 1. Prove that you are an expert. You have to know your stuff.

That doesn’t mean bragging about yourself or talking endlessly about what you’ve accomplished. But you do need to be firm on your value proposition, how you've helped others before, and why you think you will be able to help this person, etc.

You need to know your prices and timelines and the reasons why for each. You can't just say ""This will take 3 weeks"" if you can't explain why.

You also need to know about the risks, difficulties, and potential problems inherent in any deal and be able to address them if needed.

This is all part of proving you are en expert in your craft.

# 2. Manage expectations

All stress = unmet expectations. 

Show me a stressed out person and I will show you somebody who overpromised and is having trouble delivering. 

If you want to sell more you have to manage expectations. 

You have to be realistic. 

You have to underpromise and over-deliver. 

This is a much better strategy.

# 3. Add value first

Add value -> build trust -> give free advice -> get sales later. 

Find a way to prove your worth by adding value first and a sale becomes much easier! 

This could be through free advice, a free-audit, a free consulting call, etc. 

3 free ideas to help them grow their business etc. 

If you can provide value first, the sale will come later.

# 4. Make scarcity work for you

Say that you only have limited availability, or that you are only taking on 5 clients to start. 

Make scarcity work in your favor. 

Incentivize folks to act now. 

# 5. Let the other party sell themselves

At the end of the sales call I like to ask an open ended question.

If you’re talking to a customer, it goes like this. “This is a tough project with a lot of risks. I think we have a great plan to manage them, but what makes you think I could be a good fit here?” Or if you’re speaking to an investor, “Given the risks we discussed, why are you interested in investing in this project?”

Or if you're speaking to a potential web development client, “Look I’m busy and it’ll take us a few weeks to get on this. I know other companies are likely ready to go sooner. Why do you think I’m the right fit?”

Then, it’s time to shut up and let your counterpart have the floor.

Because nine times out of ten, an amazing thing happens at this moment.

The potential customer starts to talk, and they begin to sell themselves.

They tell you why they would make a good customer. How your circles overlap. How they like your approach and they soothe themselves when it comes to any concerns or objections, and then voila!

The rest of the conversation goes swimmingly. They’ve already convinced themselves they want to work with you and buy from you.

At this point you just need to say, ""Great! When can we get started?"" and close the deal.

1gamfyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gamfyd/aita_for_replacing_my_best_friend/,AITA for “replacing my best friend”?,"I (18F) had a best friend of four years. We were inseparable, the kind of duo teachers would ask, ""Where’s the other one?"" if one of us wasn’t in school. Our bond felt unbreakable, and she was the only person I ever truly connected with. I was certain our friendship would last forever.

One day, we were sitting in a coffee shop, excitedly planning our summer vacation. I travel a lot, so naturally, I took charge of booking everything—hotels, flights, etc. She would always pay me back later, and it worked for us. 

Later that evening, I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw that one of my favourite bands was having a concert in Germany (where we live), which has never happened before. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to see them. (I am not over exaggerating when I say that)

Even though my friend and I shared similar music tastes, this band wasn’t really her thing. Still, I couldn’t imagine going without her, so I begged her to join me. She eventually agreed, or so I thought.

Months later, right as I was about to buy the tickets, she sent me a message saying she wasn’t going, but that I should buy her a ticket “just in case.” I was confused—and a little angry. She’s telling me that NOW when she had months to decide? If she didn’t want to spend her money or waste her time, I would’ve understood. But her indecision? It frustrated me. However, instead of expressing how I really felt, I calmly told her that her not willing to go was completely valid and that I’d find someone else to go with. There was no way I was going to miss this concert.

That’s when everything blew up. 

She called me, furious—yelling, calling me selfish and spoiled for wanting to “replace” her with someone else. She said I only cared about myself and used her as a puppet to get to see that “ass of a group she always secretly hated.“. I was stunned. I hung up the call, thinking we both needed some space to cool off. But when I tried to reach out later, she ignored me. For days.

As our vacation drew closer, the silence dragged on, and I was left crying myself to sleep every night, not understanding what I had done wrong. I apologized over text, but she never responded. 

I couldn’t believe she left me hanging like this—without a word AND without paying me back for the vacation reservations. With the trip fast approaching, I’d had enough.

I sent her a short but final message: our vacation plans were off, and so was our friendship.

 It was over. We haven’t spoken since.

She threw four years of friendship away without a second thought, leaving me to question everything. Was I really that terrible? Did I deserve this?

No coffee, no alcohol, strict Sabbath observance, tithing... seemed like a lot of restrictions.

I was watching a documentary about Olympic athletes. These people follow insanely strict diets, training schedules, and lifestyle rules. But nobody calls that ""restrictive"" - we all get that's exactly what unleashes their full potential.

That's when it clicked: I was looking at LDS standards completely backwards. It's not about the ""can'ts"" - it's about what these standards enable you to become. Just like an athlete's discipline creates excellence, not chains.

Still learning and exploring, but that changed my whole perspective. These aren't restrictions - they're a training program for the soul.

Instead, I personally called up the Department of Education, explained the inefficiency, and they agreed to let me skip K-12 entirely.

1gam7kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1gam7kr/sometimes_i_get_these_sudden_feelings_of_longing/,"Sometimes, I get these sudden feelings of longing for a life I haven't lived yet..","Hi everyone, hope you're all doing well today :) 

Today, I felt compelled to find a place to talk to others about life––the one we currently lead, the one(s) we miss, and the one(s) we haven't gotten to yet. I wonder if other people feel the same way, and if you plan to take any particular courses of action going forward. Just as a short intro, I'm 24 years old, graduated college in May 2022, and am currently working in corporate as an assistant marketing coordinator.

I know that I'm still young and that there is so much life left to live (well, hopefully—I don't want to take it for granted), but I can't help but feel like what I'm doing now can't be what I'll be doing for the next 60+ years of my life. To be clear, I am still incredibly thankful for what I do have as I know there are many people who are struggling to make ends meet. I consider myself very fortunate for the life that I've lived and the support and love that I've received from all those around me. But I also feel that I owe it to myself to do more than simply keeping my head down and settling for an unfulfilling lifestyle. It's not that I hate my job—in fact, as things come, the work is pretty interesting, the company culture is not bad, and my team is full of kind, collaborative, and hardworking people—, but it always feels like something is missing... (I do hate the interviewing and the job search process in general though, especially with the current market. :'))

When I first started working, I was so hyper-focused on trying to do well and be successful that I started to neglect the things that are important. Fortunately, I never forgot to spend time with friends and family, but I did forget to designate time for myself and my hobbies. I've always been a creative person who made sure to have room in my life for art, music, etc., even when I was busy. But the eight hours at work (and often more) everyday was so draining that I felt like I didn't have the energy to use my brain for anything other than doom scrolling and watching shows. I tried to build a more rigid schedule for myself to help mitigate this: wake up, get ready, morning matcha/coffee, work, lunch, finish work, gym, go home, dinner, shower, and then free time for creative work or self-care. But instead of feeling like I was optimizing my time to get everything done, it started to feel really monotonous—like I was stuck in a cycle or a simulation. Soon, my creative work time was replaced by bed-rotting and staring at a screen once again.

In a way, I think I was trying to escape from the cycle by watching other people lead happy, fulfilling lives and find success in things that brought them genuine joy. Though I know social media can often be fake as well, watching other people be happy online made me happy. But it also made me feel a longing for something that reignites my passion and brings me the same amount of joy. I found myself wanting for the time and the pure, unapologetic fun that I used to have as a child. Even in college, plans could be spontaneous instead of being scheduled months in advance, hobbies could be done at any point throughout the day, and true and honest or just plain silly conversations were a dime a dozen. When the time truly living took precedent over work.   

One day I found myself really starting to think about my life and what I wanted to do. Why was working in the corporate world—something that literally millions of people do—so unfulfilling? Especially when some of my friends, my brother, parents, and cousins seem to have found their niche and excel at their jobs. Sure, I can tolerate it and probably do pretty well if I continue to just push through, but how much would that be worth? I want more. I can picture myself accomplishing more—reaching for my dreams and my passions instead of being scared and complacent with the ""normal"" path that I'm expected to take. And when I watch the people out there who've shared their success stories and the unconventional paths that brought them where they are now, I find myself wanting even more. 

I miss living to live instead of working to live. And simultaneously, I long for the ability to turn something that I love and live for into my work. For me, that would mean starting a small business around sharing my art (i.e. designing stickers, prints, stationary, washi tapes, etc.). I remember the first time I'd said I'd wanted to be an artist... I don't remember the exact age but it was inn my early elementary school years. And it was also immediately shot down by my brother. Of course he meant it as a joke, but it was rhetoric that'd I'd heard before and continued to hear as I got older. The starving artist/musician trope. And being an impressionable little girl, I was convinced from then on that it'd be nearly impossible.

Sometimes, I wish I was brave enough to admit that this was what I wanted earlier so I could get a head start on it while I was still in school and had more time to figure things out. But, I can't turn back time, nor do I like to dwell on what could've been. And now, as much as I'd like to quit my job and fully dedicate myself to pursuing my passion, I know that I'd need to have some form of income while I build a foundation for my small business and also just to... you know... survive. But I guess this is me trying to say that I'm going be more intentional with pursuing this goal moving forward. I'm going to give it a shot, because I'm tired of settling. I'm going to try my hardest to make the life that I envision for myself because 60 years from now, I don't want to think about the ""what-ifs."" 

Are any other people dealing with the same feelings/thoughts? And if so, what is the life that you envision for yourself? What is your passion project that you'd love to be able to do for a living? What makes you feel most fulfilled?

1gam7jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1gam7jd/prediction_arizona_cardinals_vs_miami_dolphins/,Prediction: Arizona Cardinals VS Miami Dolphins 2024-10-27 13,"Ah, the Arizona Cardinals versus the Miami Dolphins, a matchup that promises to be as unpredictable as a cat on a Roomba. The Cardinals, sitting at 3-4, are like that friend who always shows up late to the party but somehow manages to have a great time. Meanwhile, the Dolphins, at 2-4, are hoping Tua Tagovailoa's return will be the equivalent of finding a $20 bill in an old coat pocket—unexpected but desperately needed.

The Dolphins' offense has been about as effective as a chocolate teapot, ranking #28 in yards per game. But their defense is a different story, ranking #4 in total yards allowed per game, which is like having a really good lock on a door that leads to a room full of junk. On the other side, the Cardinals' defense is ranked #28, which is about as reassuring as a parachute made of tissue paper.

With Tua back in action, the Dolphins are favored by a modest 3.5 points, and the over/under is set at 45.5. The moneyline has the Dolphins at -172 and the Cardinals at +144, which means the bookmakers are giving the Dolphins the edge, but not by much. 

Now, considering that underdogs win about 35% of the time in football, and given the Cardinals' recent win against the Chargers, there's a glimmer of hope for Arizona fans. But let's not get carried away—this isn't a Disney movie.

Best Bet: Take the Dolphins to cover the spread at -3.5.

A bit about my old job:

It was based on Logistics around Europe, my job was basically managing our company's drivers, sending them routes and plans, telling them where to refuel etc.

Initially, it seemed fine, however, there were a couple of red flags:

\- Working hours are 8AM-5PM, strictly from the office. And we had a ""break"" from noon to 1PM. (So basically they were paying me for 8 hours, not counting the break, and by break, basically working from my phone in a cafe. (The office is in my city center so I often went out for a coffee with a few colleagues)

  
\- I was told there would be calls after work hours, but that it is rare and only if some of the drivers were having an emergency. I also had to mail him a certain list every Saturday by 10PM (this was maybe a 5 minute task at most and could be done from my work phone).

For context, I am from Eastern Europe, where you get paid minimum wage but usually work 6 days a week, and it's considered a miracle if you find any type of ""white collar"" job without needing a lot of experience or connections, so I happily accepted it, and especially since my training would be paid minimum wage. And actual 2 days off per week? Oh boy...

The training was quite alright, I met two guys who I now consider close friends, and we still catch up from time to time, one of them still works there so he gives me all the fresh info.

Anyway, the months go by, and I am actually doing full capacity work, 12-15 trucks constantly, I was given a miniscule wage increase, so I was basically making 50 dollars above minimum wage. (Which was around 400 dollars per month at the time).

  
Being that this is my first white collar job, I was just happily working and not complaining, even though at this point, the calls and e-mails were starting at 7AM, and would end at about 9PM each night, granted, it was not constantly like this, but let's be real, nobody wants to work outside of their working hours, especially because overtime was not paid at all.

  
Around September last year, I was very tired and overworked, so I quit on the spot, but there was no bad blood between me and anyone in the company.

But, as things go, I've found myself quite depressed that I was not working, and reevaluated my decision, but they called me around December asking me if I would work for them again, as an employee quit.

I accepted, since I've had no luck finding something elsewhere, and asked for a lighter workload during negotiations, since they would not budge on increasing my 500 dollars a month wage at that point.

It was alright for a couple of months, I was not doing anything dispatch or driver related, only processing some orders and maintaining the work computers, no actual calls after 5PM, so I had a good work life balance.

But afterwards, after a few issues, where the actual company CEO told one of my colleagues and friends to pack his things and get out, in a fit of rage after a driver did something stupid (not at all the fault of my colleague), he quit. He was one of their fastest and most dedicated workers.

He was doing quite a difficult task, and dispatching very ""special"" drivers, making the actual loading to unloading process a living hell, so they gave me the responsibility of doing that, great... 12 drivers.

His wage was 800 dollars per month, he quits, the company ""bumps"" my wages to 550 (minimum wage went up to 500 at this point in time). Surprisingly, I didn't find this position difficult at all, since these drivers did not speak the same language as me, our form of communication was strictly via text messages, and it was fine.

After another couple of months, I'm doing great, not complaining, while there is work after 5PM, it is strictly on text so it was not an issue, and also I get bumped up to 600 bucks. (Which is quite decent for me)

However, now they wanted me to also ""jump in"" for a remote colleague and work every 2nd weekend (2-3 hours every other Saturday and Sunday), I asked for a pay raise, they flat out denied, saying it's not in their budget. So I simply said ""Then no, if you need someone to swap in for him when he is not working, then sure, I will do that instead of dispatching trucks"" and the boss says, and I quote: ""Well alright, if you are not capable of doing this, then I will find someone else (spoiler: he did not find someone else)""

And I guess this rubbed him the wrong way, cause from this point onwards, his whole attitude towards me shifted, he started micromanaging me, chewing me out WAY MORE for simple mistakes that other colleagues also make, especially since we're all on full capacity with drivers.

At this point I was already contemplating quitting again, but gave it some time to settle, wrong move...

These are some of the highlights of how absolutely idiotic the whole company is:

\- The CEO flat out sent a wide email: "" Whoever can't be available after 5PM can reply to this email with their 2 weeks notice ""

\- I had access to my boss' PC since I was also the makeshift IT guy, and once saw, among other things, the wage bumps for next month, he bumped two of our office workers up by 50 dollars, but bumped his wage (already very high and not appropriate for his ""I'll just play clash royale and scream at people"" type of job) for over 200 dollars. I guess maintaining your beloved sports car gets expensive, I get it.

\- Group chat with all the managers and local office workers, which was used basically for the managers to chew out employees on their mistakes constantly, and so all of us could see.

\- CEO (who lives in Germany) visits our humble office in his brand new Tesla, just says ""Hello."", then goes on with his day, goes to lunch with our office boss.

  
\- Boss chewing me out for going for a cigarette ""10 minutes after my break"", which was spent on my work phone since I was just unlucky that day and most of my problems were during my ""break"". All while he is playing clash royale on his phone.

  
\- I haven't completed my personal logs and organization one Friday (my fault completely, but did not reflect on my work, it was only personal lists and files I've updated to make my job easier), so I came into the office on a Saturday to complete them, since I had a key to the office, my boss shows up randomly and sees me just working, the conversation went as follows: 

Boss: ""Why are you in shorts at the workplace?""  
Me: ""I didn't know the dress code applied on a non-work day...""  
Boss: ""Who said Saturdays are non-work days?""  
I then just smiled at him and continued on with my work, I basically quiet quit at this point.

Anyhow, I saw that my time in this company is done, I was absolutely not getting a raise anytime soon, and the torture would just continue on, so after they refused to give me a raise once more, I just said ""Alright, lemme do my 2 weeks then I'm out"".

It's been maybe 4 months, I'm enjoying my new remote position with an actual 9-5 Mon-Fri, with actual paid overtime if I do end up having to do it. And I am making the same amount during my training here as I've been making after a year in a half at my last job. 

I swing by the old office sometimes since I'm still good friends with basically everyone there except the boss, and he has no issue with me being there since I've also made it clear that giving me access to his PC was a bad idea, and I could probably ruin his reputation or actually get him fired. (I still have a flash drive with a ton of dirt on him, I don't plan on actually using it but it's good leverage)

They've had absolutely no luck with hiring new people, the first guy quit two days after completing his paid training, and the 2nd guy was not capable of doing the job so he's also been let go. 

Tensions are high in the office, because while I was still working, it was already at max capacity, and all of us agreed that we are 1 dispatcher short, and we barely had room for any vacation days (thankfully my doctor is an OG and I could get sick leave at any time for any reason), and it would involve a lot of swapping and the boss would have to actually do some work for once. 

They also called the guy that quit before me, offering him a nice wage to come back, but he flat out refused and said ""Nah y'all can offer me millions, I am not coming back."".

But now, they still haven't replaced me, and whenever I talk to any of my old colleagues privately, they are all actively searching for a better job, and it looks like the company might actually learn how to actually treat their workers, hopefully.

If you've been reading this far, thank you so much, it was nice to get this off my chest.

TLDR:

Company gave me the responsibilities of workers making double my wage, while giving me jack. It's looking like they might lose even more people while already understaffed, can't find a replacement, and I'm just here laughing from my much better job.

","I (21M) got a haircut around a month back at a new shop- the barber (20F) who cut my hair was initially not so talkative but by the end we were chatting a lot. I felt like it was a little more than just regular talk. Nonetheless, i didn’t want to be rude or make anyone uncomfortable so i never said anything. 

Anywho, i needed a cut again today (my hair grows fast) and went to the same place. Same barber, seemed glad to see me, this time we talked a lot more. Not the typical “where are ya from” bit but a lot about childhood stories and a lot of laughing. Multiple times we paused the cutting to finish a story, etc. Lots of personal talk, and if there was a lull the convo always picked back up.


I’d like to ask her on a low pressure date, something simple like dinner or a lunch or coffee. My concern is the context- i understand she is a customer service worker and i could be misreading the situation. On the other hand, i do think us being the same-ish age allows for a much more comfortable connection and conversation.

I know there is a sort of stigma about asking out workers, but i also know that you don’t meet people without taking a chance. so thats why i’m here to ask for advice. What do you guys think? Any advice if/how to go about it?

The situation is a little confusing for me because, at the end of the day, the only way to ask her out is to go ahead and ask her whenever i next get a cut- no way to avoid the customer-worker thing. ",4,1729719335.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

Even though it is not about me, but it's affecting me so much that I barely can study or concentrate or think about anything else besides this.

For context, my mom has worked in the same place for almost 30 years. She is well respected, never had any issues at work, does her job impressively well. She is kind and friendly (she even offers coffee to the cleaning lady when she comes to clean the office), and has always empathised being kind whilst raising me. She works in an office with four other ladies. 

One of them got employed about 3 years ago, if I remember well. This woman is a veterinarian and she thinks that she is better than everyone else or that she should be the boss in the office, which is not the case, as it is not an office where it's some sort of hierarchy. My mom is an engineer. They are both employed in the same office, to do almost the same job. My mother has been employed for so much longer than her, thus everyone calls her when something needs to be done. This woman, let's call her F (for fucker), started drama since she came. Her and my mother got along pretty well at first, but then F started to get frustrated that my mom got more calls or that people would often ask her for help instead of F, who thought that, because she was a veterinarian, people should ask her instead of my mom. Then she started bossing everyone around, she moved in the another office by herself.

She also has an ongoing affair of 2 years with another veterinarian who used to work in the same office, whilst being both married and has 2 young kids. They have sex every so often in her office, and she lies that she's staying late for work when instead... you know. I won't get into detail about the affair, but it's a lot about it too, because they practically teamed up to completely diminish my mom. She practically does nothing, always messes up reports, watches movies instead of doing her job. My mom often does her paperwork and she only signs it.

When another lady got employed, also a veterinarian, my mom suggested that, because the unused desk in the main office was kind of shaky, she should stay in the separate office with F. What did F do? It has not been proven, but suddenly the empty desk in her office got DESTROYED and i'll tell you that it did not look accidental at all. She had several conflicts with my mom who made the mistake not to speak up from the start, bashing her for asking for the help from some workers when they had to lift some heavy arvhieves and move them in another room, that she ""got used to act like a princess"", whatever that means. My mother stood up like 2 times and told F to stop bossing people around and acting so 

One of the ladies my mom works with is the only one that F talks to, but then she will proceed to tell my mom what F told her. She always says mean things about my mom, almost obsessively criticizing everything that she does, how she dresses and acts. I advised my mom not to engage with this coworker, because she will most likely do the same thing to her and tell F about what my mom said, and I'd like to think she listened. She probably did, as she does not like gossiping. She told me that whenever this other coworker tells her something about F, she keeps a neutral tone and attitude towards the topic in question.

Now, what really happened... F went to their boss and started PROJECTING. She lied to their boss that my mom has an affair with some random coworker who she NAMED (she is literally the one with an affair) and my mom literally does not engage with that person outside of work and in a group. She mentioned that my dad has an affair too (my dad never leaves the goddamn house, does not have friends and is always home by 4PM). She told the boss that my mom bosses everyone around her, that she does not do her job. That another lady that my mom is friends with does not come to work??? She literally started inventing stuff. 

I have a hard time thinking that someone would actually believe her, as everyone besides her (and the man that she cheats on her husband with) likes my mom and appreciates her. She has worked here for a long long time and she always did a great job. A veterinarian who she is close with told her all of this, as she has heard this from the boss. Everyone advised her to always be careful around F, because she is malicious and will try everything in her power to destroy her.

I am just so sad because she DOES NOT deserve this. At all. And I am shocked that insane, frustration-driven people exist and walk freely on the streets. My mom has always been kind to F, treated her with respect and never ever did anything bad to her. I suffer truly and I hope things will get sorted out somehow.

# How to Find Fast Food Restaurants Near Me

Finding a fast food restaurant nearby is super easy. Here are some tips to help you find the best places:

# Using Apps

You can use apps like Google Maps or Yelp to find nearby spots. Just type “fast food near me,” and you’ll see a list of places like McDonald’s, Taco Bell, or Chick-fil-A. You can also read reviews to see what others think!

# How Google Maps Works

Google Maps is an app you can use on your phone or computer. When you search for fast food, it shows a map with red dots marking the restaurants nearby. You can click on each dot to see details like their hours, the menu, and even pictures of the food! It’s like having a mini-guide right in your pocket.

# Using Voice Commands

If you don’t want to type, just ask your phone! You can say, “Hey Google, where is the nearest fast food restaurant?” This is quick and handy when you’re out with friends.

# Voice Command Tips

Make sure your phone’s voice assistant is set up. You can use phrases like “find a burger place” or “show me fast food options.” It’s really helpful if you’re in a hurry or if your hands are full with bags or drinks!

# Checking Reviews

Before you decide where to go, check the reviews! A restaurant with 5 stars means people loved it, while 2 stars might mean you should try somewhere else.

|Star Rating|Meaning|
|:-|:-|
|⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|Amazing! A must-try!|
|⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|Pretty good! Most enjoyed it.|
|⭐️⭐️⭐️|It’s okay; some things could be better.|
|⭐️⭐️|Not great; consider other options.|
|⭐️|Skip it! Most people didn’t enjoy it.|

# What to Look For in Reviews

When you read reviews, look for details. Some people might talk about the speed of service, the taste of the food, or even how clean the restaurant is. If multiple reviews mention the same thing, it’s likely true! For example, if many reviews say the fries are the best, you might want to try them!

# The Best Types of Fast Food for Families

Eating out with family can be a fun treat! Here are some great fast food places that are perfect for family meals:

# Family Meal Deals

Many fast food spots, like KFC or Popeyes, offer family meal deals. These usually include a big meal with chicken, sides, and biscuits. It’s a great way for everyone to enjoy a meal together!

# The Benefits of Play Areas

Play areas can make eating out much easier for families. Kids can play while parents wait for their meals, making it a less stressful experience. It also gives families a chance to relax together after a busy day.

# Drive-Through Fun

You can also enjoy a drive-through meal. Grab your favorite fast food and head to a nearby park to eat together. It’s simple and fun!

To make your drive-through meal even more special, consider packing a picnic blanket. After you get your food, find a nice spot to sit and enjoy. You can also bring drinks or snacks from home to share!

Restaurants like Chipotle or Subway let you create your own meal. You can choose what goes into your burrito or sandwich, making it fun to share ideas with friends!

Customizing your meal lets you explore different flavors. Maybe your friend likes spicy salsa while you prefer mild. Sharing each other’s creations can help you discover new favorites together!

If you want fast service, Taco Bell is known for being the quickest! They have an average drive-thru time of about 4 minutes, which is faster than many others.

# Tasty Food

A great fast food restaurant serves delicious food that you’ll want to come back for, like crispy fries or tasty burgers!

# Secret Menu Items

Did you know some fast food places have secret menu items? These are items that aren’t on the regular menu but can be made if you ask. For example, some places have special combinations or different toppings that aren’t listed. Asking about secret menu items can lead to exciting discoveries!

# Quick and Friendly Service

Fast food is about speed, but friendly staff make it even better. A smile can make your meal more enjoyable.

# What to Expect from Staff

When you go to a fast food restaurant, you should expect staff to be polite and helpful. If you have questions about the menu or need help making a choice, they should be ready to assist you.

If you’re nervous, try something similar to what you already like. If you love cheeseburgers, maybe try a chicken sandwich next.

# Gradual Exploration

If you usually eat plain cheeseburgers, you might want to try one with extra toppings or a different type of cheese first. Gradually exploring new flavors helps build your confidence!

# Ask for Suggestions

Don’t be afraid to ask the staff or your friends what they recommend. They might suggest a tasty new item you haven’t tried yet!

# Get Recommendations

When you’re at a restaurant, asking, “What’s your favorite dish?” can lead to great suggestions. Staff members often have their own favorites that are worth trying!

# Look at Pictures

Menus often have pictures or descriptions that can help you decide what to try. A picture of a delicious burger might make you want to order it!

# Menus with Descriptions

When a menu includes detailed descriptions of dishes, it can help you decide. Look for words like “crispy,” “spicy,” or “tender” to find something that sounds delicious to you!

# Explore Different Types of Food

Fast food can be more than just burgers and fries. You can try tacos, sushi, or even Italian sandwiches at some places!

# Trying International Foods

Don’t be afraid to explore international fast food options! Many places have flavors from around the world, like sushi rolls or curry dishes. Trying different cuisines can make your meals more exciting!

# Making Fast Food Healthier

Fast food doesn’t always have to be unhealthy! Here are some tips for making better choices:

# Choose Smaller Portions

If you’re feeling full after a small meal, try ordering a smaller size. Many places offer kid-sized meals or smaller portions of sides.

# The Benefits of Smaller Meals

Ordering smaller portions allows you to enjoy your favorite foods without overeating. You can also save room to try something new!

# Opt for Healthier Sides

Instead of fries, consider healthier options like salads, fruit cups, or yogurt. Many fast food places are adding healthier choices to their menus.

# Choosing the Right Sides

When ordering, check if the restaurant offers side salads or baked potatoes. These can be tasty alternatives to fries and give you a balanced meal!

# Stay Hydrated

Instead of sugary sodas, consider water, lemonade, or iced tea. Staying hydrated is important for feeling good!

# Fun Drink Alternatives

You can also try sparkling water or flavored water for a refreshing twist. Many restaurants now offer these options!

# Conclusion

Exploring fast food is about more than just eating; it’s about finding new flavors and having fun with friends and family. Now you know how to find the best fast food spots in Dallas, what makes them special, and some tips for trying new things. The next time you’re hungry, you’ll know just where to go for a tasty meal! Happy eating, and may your fries always be crispy!

I made my way down 123a through the dense forest and curves that would make Charo proud. I filled my water jugs and kept on going and went to the South Acworth Village Store to slake my thirst for a cold brew. It’s a community owned store and a great idea, but that is another story. 
I’ve been along every road that you can take to get there and can say the scenery is stunning with the farms, forests, rivers hills and scattered mines no matter which direction you get there from.  So if you ever find yourself bored or watching tv, load up your crew and head there. Pick up a beer, coffee or local foods, whatever your poison, and just enjoy the whole experience.

Ps.
I’ve got to say I love driving on roads with a letter on the end (other than new) in NH!  123a is probably my favorite and I’m also partial to 116c (I think that’s what it is)…Any other good ones you can think of?

I don't usually post this sort of thing, I keep to myself, but I've been feeling more listless lately, and I figured typing out this Sad Boy post would be better than just spending another day laying in bed, feeling miserable. I watch Dr.K on and off, and I've found it, at the very least, informative. I figured, I may as well throw this out into the wild, and get it off my chest.

To preface, I have ADHD and Dyslexia, though I don't think their directly related with my current issues. I have a hard time articulating myself and can be pretty rambling, I have a hard time being concise, so I ask for your patience with my post. I'm a thirty year old male, never been in a romantic relationship, never tried to have a relationship, and never wanted to be in a relationship. I can't think of a single person in my entire life where I was attracted to them physically or emotionally. I don't have any real friends, either, never had and not trying to find any.

I don't want to be happy, anymore. I think I actually gave up a long time ago, but it was only in the last few weeks I realized I've completely given up. Video games have lost their appeal to me, doom scrolling does nothing for me, porn does nothing for me, work does nothing for me. I just wake up, lay in bed until I have to get out, go to work, come home, and sleep. I'm not really financially struggling, I wouldn't call myself secure, but I have a job where I can save a few hundred dollars per month. I just don't enjoy life in anyway, shape or form.

My issue is, I don't want to be happy. I don't feel like I want to fix my problems. I have a deep dissatisfaction with the world, and the older I get, the worse it is. I remember very vividly, when I was a child, like 8-9, riding in a car and a local pastor pointed out a tree that was often a meeting point for human trafficking (I was not born in America), and I said we should cut it down. He pointedly told me, that wouldn't solve anything, and that stuck with me. Despite everything, all I can offer are meaningless gestures. The act of existence being at the expense of others really bothers me. I do not eat chocolate, because of child slave labor, I developed an eating disorder for a while when I heard people were worked to death in some local farms harvesting vegetables crops, I can barely stand meat because of ranching conditions. I hate how all the food on my plate is a product of suffering, and while I don't have that eating disorder anymore, and I eat more than I should because the monkey brain demands the easy dopamine, I can't find any joy in it. I'll enjoy it in the moment, sort of, mask on long enough, but the guilt always comes back.

I find media more and more unpleasant. I don't like being reminded the world sucks, constantly, and media is not much of an escape. I can play farming sims, sure, and I do, but there's only so much I can play them before I get bored, and realize there's very little else to do. Scrolling on social media does nothing for me either, I've hyper curated my feed to be mostly art and memes, but sometimes Fresh New Tragedies still slip past, and ruins my entire day. Endless scrolling only to be slapped across the face with P-Diddy jokes because Rape is Funny.

I find no satisfaction in work, I've tried different things and have just accepted I'm not the kind of person who can enjoy working. It will always be something I do out of obligation for survival and nothing else. I don't enjoy sitting on my laurels, I just find no reason or desire to take satisfaction in making rich people richer. I did try once to train for social worker, or similiar roles, maybe find fufillment in helping people and making it better, but I realized I don't have the emotional capacity to deal with the absolute worst humanity has to offer on a regular basis. I don't find connection with my co-workers, and I don't want to either.

I hate the casual cruelty of the world. I find it utterly intolerable. I hate how violence is just accepted, I hate how I have to watch people put each other and myself at risk of injury or death so we can both catch the same stop light, and this is just accepted as “How people are.” I don't want to be happy in such a cruel world, where chocolate picked by slaves is sold for a dollar fifty, where woman have a 33% percent of being sexually abused, and all of this and more is dished out as casual entertainment to have on as background noise from news channels with morning coffee. I want nothing to do with any of it. I don't want to make it, when this is the building blocks.

And I know I'm the outsider. I'm a judgmental, pretentious prick, I know that. Everyone else is fine with it. Laugh at the P-Diddy jokes, giggle when a tiktok video smash cuts to hundreds of people dying for a 9/11 meme. This is normal. This is accepted. I understand I'm the strange one, I'm the broken one, everyone is better than me, and I am less than everyone else. Their right, I'm wrong, their good, I'm bad. There are days when I don't even really consider myself human, because I feel so disconnected from society and even other people as a whole. I have no friends, I have no one I want to be friends with and I don't like my family. Thing I used to find joy in, Video Games, Media in general, Nature, no longer give me anything anymore. It's all so empty.

And I've tried everything. Meditation doesn't work, distractions no longer distract me enough, even nature is ruined for me. It worked for a bit, I had this one hiking path I really enjoyed going down, it passed near a clear ice-water run off brook, and I remember how wonderful it was in the fall, the colors of the trees, and the many bluejays in the area, my favorite bird. When I ended my hike, and came back to reality, things slowly faded back in, but it was a nice break. When I mentioned I was planning on going camping and I told them where when they asked, they made sure to let me know a few years ago they found the body of a girl who was kidnapped from school in that same area and never found the killers. A cute little fun-fact, I suppose. A funny tidbit.

I never returned to that spot, and I stopped hiking soon afterwards, as that all I could think about on future hikes, even in different locations. It illustrates a huge reason why I don't even bother trying to interact with other people. If such awfulness is just a fun fact to drop in peoples laps at a drop of a hat is normal, and normal people think that's acceptable, than honestly, I'm good being alone for the rest of my life. I say that, but of course, the monkey brain demands socialization, so I just end up in this toxic loop of interacting with people when I know would rather not, and walking away just disappointed.

I have no passions, no drive, nothing. Just wake up, work, sleep, repeat. I barely even play video games, they don't motivate me enough to get out of bed, I just end up jerking all day instead, and I don't even look at porn, after that whole Pornhub scandal, I was so deeply disturbed and disgusted, I don't look at online sexual material anymore.

There's so much more I could whine about, but the crux of everything is, I live in a world I do not enjoy being in.

So what do I do? Where do I find my place in a world I don't want to be a part of? How do I find happiness when I don't even want happiness?",1,1729718667.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1gals27,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1gals27/how_do_you_make_friends/,How do you make friends ? ,"Hello everybody !

I'm don't know what i'm hoping but i still wanted to give reddit a shot... So basically I (F20) have a group of five friends from my hometown which I love very much but don't see often because I study elsewhere. I made these friends in elementary school but since then it's like I can't do it anymore. Middle school was very lonely and the friends I thought I made just made fun of me and didn't really consider me their friend, just the ""pet"" of the group because I guess I was gullible and I helped them with homework. When high school came I had pretty bad mental health and most people in my class were immature and I guess I didn't click with anyone.

I had my hopes up for college because I worked my asses off and got into my dream major which is famous for it's heavy partying and close knit students. The thing is the first month is all hazing and absolutely crazy parties. The 2nd years made a big show of it and put videos of them blackout drunk, vomiting, making out like crazy and even dancing practically naked on tables. Coming there I had barely drunk my first beer and never went to a club (yay social awkwardness and anxiety) so I got so so scared ! They started to announce the groups and I panicked and left. I didn't participate at all to anything because I was scared and didn't know anyone. Now I regret deeply my decision because I can't seem to make one friend and all the groups are formed...

I try being friendly and nice but it never seem to work beyond saying hello and exchanging basic small talk. I don't ask for a BFF just someone to go to the library with and drinking a coffee sometime...

I see my hometown friends on the weekend but I feel transparent 5 out of 7 days a week when in college and I would do anything for the situation to change but I don't know how.

I see the people in my class all together in the library and it makes me so sad to always go alone when none of them seem to ever do that.

I love being alone I really do but it is starting to feel very heavy when no one invites you to anything ever. It makes me wonder if I'm even worth it sometimes. 

Recently I thought I had made friends with these girls and I was ecstatic because they are so cool and chill. There was this Halloween party I really wanted to go to, so I asked them if they were coming because no one goes to a party alone (I don't know if this is common practice but here little groups gather at some houses before going to the club) and they both said that they didn't really felt like it despite me trying to hype them up (not too much of course, I was just exited to go to a party with my friends). So I went back to my home town kinda disappointed only to see on insta that they indeed went to the party...

I felt so sad... my heart kinda sunk when I saw this. They don't really engage much with me outside of class, it's mostly me that messages trying to set up some library session or hangout. I guess I overestimated their opinion of me but I was so happy that someone seemed to genuinely like me outside of me lifelong friends. It was so refreshing ! 

Now I feel like i'm ""bothering"" them, they never ask me to hang out or invite me to do anything... and I don't what to do because I just want some friends...

Basically I cannot for the life of me get beyond the small talk stage (with friends) without it feeling like i'm getting ahead of myself or bothering the person. Do you have advice on this ? Or on how to make some friends when all the groups are already formed. I would appreciate any advice <3

Today I got an email asking about ""REDDIT DEFAMATION"" concerning a CEO's company PLUTUS, which was written about in a [post on here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffeezilla_gg/comments/1g9cjrj/the_plutus_scam/) They heavily imply defamation and that a legal team is ""reviewing"" it. You can see my reply below.

I wanted to take the time to clarify publicly that while I enjoy this community, I do not moderate any posts, and instead leave that to our very capable volunteer MOD team. In the future I will link this post to similar requests for removal. Should anyone feel that they have a problem with this community, they can submit requests to the MOD team who will review it and make their own decision based on policies that were determined independently. I have no say in that process.

To show you what I mean, I might be submitting my own takedown request based on a [possibly defamatory post against me which you can see here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffeezilla_gg/comments/1g7yilf/damn_i_cant_take_my_eyes_off_them/) Hopefully the MODs can see through that obvious libel, because they're going to have final say on it.   

Hope that clears things up and have a nice day.

It illustrates a huge reason why I don't even bother trying to interact with other people. If such awfulness is just a fun fact to drop in peoples laps at a drop of a hat is normal, and normal people think that's acceptable, than honestly, I'm good being alone for the rest of my life. I say that, but of course, the monkey brain demands socialization, so I just end up in this toxic loop of interacting with people when I know would rather not, and walking away just disappointed. 



I have no passions, no drive, nothing. Just wake up, work, sleep, repeat. I barely even play video games, they don't motivate me enough to get out of bed, I just end up jerking all day instead, and I don't even look at porn, after that whole Pornhub scandal, I was so deeply disturbed and disgusted, I don't look at online sexual material anymore.

There's so much more I could whine about, but the crux of everything is, I live in a world I do not enjoy being in. 

So what do I do? Where do I find my place in a world I don't want to be a part of? How do I find happiness when I don't even want happiness?",1,1729718367.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

What to expect?","TL,DR; despite her being busy and my offer being kinda ridiculous my crush accepted my invitation and pushes for an early get together. May she want this to be a date?

So I recently pitched my crush (she knows since we talked about it) the idea to re-watch some movies (a trilogy) and to make dinner together.  She likes those movies okay, but she knows it's my favorite franchise. 

I presented this as a joke since that re-watch would take the entire day and because I wanted to give her an easy way to decline.

But despite that and her usually being very busy, she told me to hit her up in a few days, as soon as she's back in town so that we can do this early next week. 

I actually thought she'd decline since in my mind it sounded kinda ridiculous and even If not we're meeting end of next week already for some coffee so her pushing for meeting up so soon caught me off guard.

Is it possible she wants this to be a date?

She responds with “Is that you asking me out on a date? I prefer to do formal dinners for first dates.” I was a bit taken aback tbh. I told her that I’d much rather do something low pressure so we can have fun and get to know each other a bit more, and she immediately unmatched me. I understand that some people want to be ‘impressed’ and won’t do things that’s they deem ‘low effort’ like coffee or something, but I felt that was a decent first date idea that was low stakes and could’ve been fun for both of us.

The ice crunched beneath both Adam and Ian's feet as they delved deeper into the frosted corridor. Ian made sure he would take the lead, if there was to be any imminent danger he didn't want his son to suffer another accident. Granted there wasn't much in the way of life this far under the ice. But even with their headlamps, they still couldn't see everything. One wrong move could spell certain disaster if they happened upon an opening or thin patch of ice. If anyone was going to get injured going further then it would be Ian, he had made up his mind once he was reunited with his son. If there was another accident in the first place he wasn't sure what the survival rating would even be, they already had to use an emergency nano-robotic syringe to keep Adam in one piece. With the sounds of their footsteps crunching dryly and echoing back at them Adam began to wonder what was at the center of the reading on his dad's tracking device. With the colors bleeding around them both as they continued Adam broke the silence first.



""So Dad, what kinds of things normally make a sensor reading happen? this kind of thing happen a lot?""

 

He asked curious as to the answer.



""To tell you the truth son usually it's something like what we came across already. That big empty cavern you fell down is usually what would set this thing off in the first place""

 

Ian said as he gently tapped the screen of the beeping device.



""But I'm pretty surprised this tunnel is here, the position of it all doesn't make sense to me.""



Adam couldn't help but cock his head slightly at that.



""What do you mean? you said before that a lot of tunnels end up forming from the runoff gas from the volcano right? Doesn't it make sense for there to be a tunnel leading into a big cavern?""



Ian nodded his head making the light bob up and down the long stretches of the tunnel.



""Mhmm, normally that would be the case. But what doesn't make sense is where it resides. Like I mentioned up top we aren't going to or near Mt. Erebus, so for this kind of tunnel to be here is strange. Something else had to have caused this, I wouldn't think it to be water runoff or a new opening from far far below us here for gas to creep through. If that was the case we would have the seismograph readings to back that claim up.""



Ian said with a furrowed brow trying to figure out what possibly could have led to this tunnel's creation.

Adam had seen this look on his Dad's face before, it got stuck like that when he was stumped about something. He hoped that unique feature wasn't too hereditary. He asked again trying to satiate his curiosity.



""Has anything like this happened before then? I mean, here we are. Walking down a tunnel that you're saying doesn't make sense. So something had to make it be here right?""



Adam never saw his Dad's face change, whatever this was had genuinely caught him off guard.



""As far as I know this is an outlier. Sure, there are a ton of different ice caves and intersecting tunnels but there is usually an obvious answer as to their formation. So no, I wouldn't say this kind of thing happens all that often, if ever in the first place. We usually get readings from something like the cavern and go from there. We could move if it's too dangerous to remain above it, explore if there's an opening and see what kind of life exists there, or drill directly down and try to feed down a camera to see what the sensor is pinging back at us.""



Ian said as he continued thumping on his sensor with a slightly heavier hand.



""It doesn't make sense to be here, no, it shouldn't be here. But like you said yourself son, here we are walking along in a place that has no sense to be to begin with. Whatever it is that did this escapes me.""



Adam's eyes gleamed with excitement at his father's words, he quickly interjected and spoke with passion.



""Well, I for one think it's pretty exciting, My very first time out here and we're exploring something not even YOU know the answer to! That means I get to see how it's done right? you have to show me what to look for, what to gather for research, HOW to research. Whatever the answer is for it being here I'm stoked that I get to be here with you to get to the bottom of it!"" 



Ian chuckled and smirked at his son at that response.



""Whatever it is, I'm glad you're here with me and having a good time no less. I gotta tell you I still can't believe how you're up and walking around so soon after that nasty fall, your recovery mentally is remarkable Adam.""



As Ian brought back up the incident Adam remembered the searing pain in his hands, the shooting nerves screaming back at him when his legs hit the ground. It was not something someone could easily forget, let alone recover quickly from. He was thankful that his Dad had been so foresightful in making sure there were emergency supplies, without them, he didn't think he'd be able to get out of there alive. He looked at his open palms as he trailed behind Ian, the dried blood and burnt plastic bits still clinging on to where the rope had left its mark on him. It was fascinating to him that the nano-bots healed him in such a fashion they did, there was no scarification. It felt strange to him admittedly how he could see his new skin looking fresh and unscathed but the 

contrasting remains of what he called a glove looked so ravished. 



As they made their way further in the tunnel a sudden wave of air pushed against them firmly. It felt warm and had almost a metallic smell to it, it felt like it was almost alive to him. Adam thought it uncanny to have something like this happen in such a barren frigid place. His Dad was right, something about this wasn't quite right and he was beginning to put the pieces together that there might be more to this than either of them first believed. Adam felt his heart quicken ever so slightly, he wasn't sure if it was from 

excitement or fear rising up into him.



""Dad, what was that?""



He said with a quiver in his voice, trying to mask the uncertainty he was feeling.



""I don't rightly know Adam, the sensor isn't detecting any trace amounts of anything harmful so I think it's safe to say we can rule out the gas runoff theory. Am I crazy though or did that smell like pennies?""



Ian replied with a bout of curiosity that briefly trumped his locked-in facial features.



""It did, It felt weird to me. don't laugh at me for this but it felt like it was alive, like it was in search of something.""



Ian paused in front of Adam as the scanner pings quickened to a more rapid pace. There was something up ahead just out of sight for the both of them. Ian put his hand behind him keeping his son within arms reach and blocking anything that might come out of nowhere. Adam felt his heartbeat grow faster and louder, it was in his ears now. For a moment they stood frozen as the ice around them waiting in anticipation for something unexpected to come charging at them. It was as if time had gotten snagged on a second and stretched itself over a long refrain, refusing to move. Releasing a breath they hadn't realized they were holding, Ian took an inch forward. As Ian took his step another wave of air hit them again, but much stronger than the first. The metallic smell had gotten stronger, and there was an electric feeling in the air as if it carried a charge. Despite Ian taking the lead Adam felt 

something pulling him in, as if it were drawing him specifically to beckon him closer. 



Ian looked behind him and saw a look on Adams's face that Was equal parts confused and both fascinated. Having made sure his son was safe he pressed on, he too felt his heart quicken at whatever it was they were encroaching on. The air felt heavy as each crunch of their footsteps seemed to get louder the closer they got to the reading. At last, they reached another cavern, but this one was much smaller than what they first discovered. As they rounded the corner what awaited them baffled them both. A chunk of metal lay upon a rock nestled into the ice, with a faint glow emanating a changing blue-to-green coloration. It seemed to ungulate in place gently, its purpose unknown to either of them. Adam was in awe from what they were both seeing.



""D-Dad, is that some piece of equipment left here by another research team?""



Ian was in disbelief, he almost hadn't registered that Adam was talking to him. After a moment of silence, he realized that he was being asked a question and figured out the words to answer with. 



""Adam I have no idea what that is, I've never seen anything like it. We need to be careful right now"" 



He urged caution above all else, this strange thing didn't sit right with him one bit.

As Ian brought up his scanner, sure enough, this was the epicenter of the signal his sensor was detecting. And in that moment, the metallic fragment began to vibrate with intensity. The colors brightened and unleashed a wave of air with electricity fanning out originating from the strange object. Both Ian and Adam had been forcibly moved to the walls, the electricity danced around them as they were held in place by an unknown pressure being exerted against them. The electricity jumped all around them until suddenly, a stray bolt hit Adam squarely in his head. Adam screamed out of reflex, but no pain accompanied the electricity that assailed him. Ian cried out, terrified by the sight of his son being shocked and unable to help or stop it from hurting him.



""ADAM! JUST HOLD ON SON, I'M HERE!"" 



Ian managed to get out the only thing he could think to string together. In that moment when he was pinned to the wall, the words that escaped were that of a painfully scared parent. Adam fell unconscious in an instant as the electricity whipped more vigorously around him, he found himself in a blackened empty room. There were no doors, no windows, nor any shapes around him. Only darkness enveloped his senses, leaving him startled and alone again. He didn't understand what was going on, one moment he was in a cavern with his Dad and the next he was here unable to make sense of his location. He tried to cry out for Ian in a desperate attempt to find his father, but no words came out. Unable to speak he began to panic, but there was no heavy heartbeat in his ears or trembling in his body. It was then that he realized he couldn't find his body, he felt oddly disconnected from it. He thought to himself trying to get a grip on the situation.



""I-Is this a dream?! it has to be, this is crazy! DAD!""



The words he thought echoed around him, leaving him even more confused.



""Wait, is that me? I'm not talking, I'm thinking, this HAS to be a dream!""



As his thoughts manifested around his senses a light appeared distantly, it was that same hue of blue and green that he remembered seeing in the cavern. It was far away and seemed to be bouncing around with intent, he felt it calling out to him. He tried calling out to it but again no words came out, he had to think of them instead.



""Hello?""



his voice seemed to echo all around him, the light stopped in its tracks and began to approach him with blistering speed. whatever it was, it was headed straight for him. Something he could only call a voice boomed around him, he would have reached for his ears but there was no way to stop it from reaching him despite how badly he wanted it to end. It was a garbled mess, 

unrecognizable at first.



""PLEASE, I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND!""



he shouted in his mind as loud as he could think to, the ball of light hung in the space in front of him. Slowly twisting and contorting to different shades of vibrant blue and lush green. 



""Scan complete, higher life-form detected. Would you like to begin recorded emergency transmission?""



The voice filled the space as it had before, but in a monotone speech he could now recognize. It still proceeded to envelope what he could call his hearing.



""EMERGENC- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!? PLEASE, STOP SHOUTING!""



The sphere of light contorted once more before speaking again.



""Orders confirmed, Auditory sensory input augmented.""



It spoke again with the same monotone voice, but this time softer. It was as if it went from shouting at every perceivable octave to a pleasant conversation over coffee. He was relieved that he didn't need to be assaulted further by its booming voice. With a newfound sense of quiet, he was able to focus on the sphere before him. It originally appeared featureless, floating effortlessly just before him. But now he could see it more clearly, It seemed like a man made out of a tree. Its colors still changed hues, but the shape never altered after he made it out. This entity before him was unlike anything he had ever seen, he didn't understand what it was supposed to be. It seemed to breathe, and idle as if waiting for a new command.



""Are the new parameters acceptable?""



Still awestruck, Adam thought his reply nervously. Unable to run anywhere, unable to hide from this entity.



""Y-yes, that's b-better""



""Orders confirmed, the scan has been completed and results in you being a higher life form. Would you like to begin the recorded 

emergency transmission?""



The entity spoke more with more complexity than it had initially, Adam was still confused as to what it meant.



""I'm sorry, I. . I don't understand what you mean, where am I?""



The entity continued to float before him, and as it did more features of the black void surrounding them came into picture. He could almost make out that there were monitors, or screens of some sort with information faintly displayed upon them. He found himself sitting in a chair, with his body slowly fading into focus as well. The entity now stood before him, no longer a featureless sphere undulating different hues of color. Now it was more definitively a manlike tree, it had thin brown bark for skin and a myriad amount of minuscule leaves for what he knew as hair. It still wasn't entirely clear to him what this was or where he was, but as he began to 

think his next question the voice interjected in response to him.



""You are in the Null, a space created in the host by my creator's the Vexaleria.""



Baffled at this, Adam continued to think his next question. But again, as he had tried before the entity interjected and cut him off.



""We currently reside in your mind, the Null is created upon contact with the fragmented piece of my pilot's transceiver. You may recall what you would call electricity making contact with you, that is both a defensive measure as well as a means to scan you to test your DNA composition. The scan results indicated that you were a higher life-form with notable technological readings about you, as well as not being the aggressor species my pilot fled from. My pilot left me a recorded emergency transmission that is to be relayed to the next suitable species capable of higher life. Would you like me to relay the recorded emergency transmission to you?""



Astonished and overwhelmed by this newfound information, Adam took a moment to collect himself before answering. He found himself only having more questions to ask, but as he was thinking he noticed that he couldn't hear them as before. As more time went on he appeared to be in a cockpit of sorts, monitors lit up with information he couldn't comprehend. He tried to reach up for his mouth, and to his surprise this time he found it. He shook off the uncertainty that lay all around him and pushed forward like he knew his Dad would do. And in that fleeting moment where he was inspired by Ian, he panicked and tried to use his mouth once more.



""Where is my Dad!? Does this mean I'm dead!?""



""Negative, as I said before we are in the Null. We are still where you were first scanned, but this conversation is taking place entirely within your own mind. As for the other being scanned he was deemed a higher life-form but without trace amounts of notable technological readings. He is currently unharmed as the DNA scan did not result in him being the aggressor species my pilot fled from. The mission given to me by my pilot was not to kill unless necessary, I was to relay the emergency transmission and 

proceed forward beyond that scope when able.""



Adam was relieved that his Dad was unharmed, but now the curiosity bestowed upon him by his Father was making him feed into this entity. He wanted to know what it meant, who is he and what does he mean by his pilot? What aggressor species he even meant completely evaded him, and ultimately what was this message meant for the next suitable life form? He knew there one likely one simple way to find out, so he asked his next question with no real way of knowing what it could entail.



""I'm not sure what you mean by a lot of that, but if you relay that transmission will it explain more?""



""Affirmative, The information stored in the transmission is of vital importance and holds the last moments of my pilot before his death. Please confirm, would you like me to begin the recorded emergency transmission?""

Adam felt a smile form across his recently discovered mouth, where he was once frightened and unsure of what to make of this situation he now found himself excited to see just what this entity had in store for him. Letting the smile fade he gave the order with now reassured confidence.



""Yes, begin the emergency transmission.""



Lights began to flicker all around him and everything black became blindingly white, sounds he didn't recognize filled the room and a violent shaking encompassed the chair.



""Orders confirmed, recreating recorded emergency transmission. Connection to Neural pathways initiating. Beginning transmission.""



As everything shook around him, with a blink he found himself back in the pilots seat. But this time racing across the naked expanse of space. The monitors now clear to him and flashing numerous amounts of readings back at him. He couldn't believe what he was seeing, when suddenly a different voice spoke out.

1galifv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1galifv/im_afraid_my_best_friends_fiancée_is_going_to/,I'm afraid my best friends fiancée is going to kill her. ,"Warning: DV and SA

I know there is little I can do to help Phyllis, my friend, and that's only if she accepts it. 

She's afraid no one else will want her because she is a black trans woman. She wants to keep her standard of living and fears living in poverty if she leaves. 

Jake, her fiancée, is horrible. No one likes him. Not even his dogs. He's manipulative, childish, and takes advantage of her in every way. She's his only friend. 

Jake has issues. He's threatened her life and his with a gun. She's called the cops on him. He has driven recklessly with her in the car. He berates her. Anything she does is wrong to him. There is also SA. Jake will relentlessly provoke her - reactive abuse. He will smile after she reacts, and she will feel ashamed.  He threatened to call the cops on her, for nothing - he said they will believe whatever because he's white and she's black. 

She is the door mat for his family. Jake's father spied on his son and her having sex, and often acts inappropriatly. The dad and family will put any blame and responsibilities on her. 

When Jake comes home, she feels nothing but anxiety, and the dogs run upstairs. 

Phyllis has made good money, over $30/hr, she is very organized and efficient. She finds time to do the things she loves and goes to therapy. Conventionally, she is absolutely gorgeous, well dressed, and in shape. She is fun, engaging, and brilliant. She does suffer from body dismorphia and anxiety. 

She worked full-time, does his laundry, cooks his food, does all the chores and gardens, takes care of the dogs, funds and completes all house projects. She alone furnished and decorated their house - that apparently is only in his name even though he used her credit to help get a loan. Her car, that she pays for, has his name on it too. 

He finatully abuses her and lords the house over her. Takes all her money for ""bills"". She has no savings. He wants to make her a stay at home dog mom, but also complains when she was out of work. Then he gambled away over 40k in savings. 

She says things like ""he's dumb, he doesn't know what he is doing. Hes scared of me."" She recognizes that his abuse is abuse, but she uses that awareness as an excuse to stay with him - an illusion that she is in control. She claims the house is ""her sanctuary"" until he gets home. She is desperately trying to make this situation work. They went to couples counseling, and she said she can fix him and fall in love him. They also trauma bonded. 

One day, she came over in the morning crying. We sat on the floor and talked about what she wanted to do. She decided to move in with me and my boyfriend. So we drove to her place and moved her out in under two hrs before Jake got home from work. 

I did think carefully before offering a place to stay. Having a DV victim stay with you can be difficult or even end the friendship, but her safety is more important than our friendship. 

I moved out of my office, bought an air mattress, and lent her my laptop. She is someone who wants to know expectations, so we talked about living arrangements. We agreed she would not pay rent, there is no timeline for finding a job, just that she applies to them, and she can help with some house projects/chores. She can help herself to our coffee and food. I also offered to help, if she's comfortable, with a few bills so she doesn't fall behind - she doesn't have to pay me back. I'm in a position where I can help someone in this way. I understand that I offered a lot, and that can be overwhelming, so I was always open to more conversations. 

Emotionally, Phyllis was up and down. She was terrified that Jake would crawl through her window at night. Jake actually stalked me and found out where I live and would drive by. 

We spent a lot of time talking. She was happy not to be anxious all the time. She applied to jobs. She spoke with hope and excitement about the new things in her life. She joined a trans support group. She shared more about what he did to her. No one deserves to be treated the way she was.  

But. Jake sent hateful messages, then love bombed, then hate, repeat. Jake bought her things like expensive jewlery, trips, and lots of promises. 

Phillis decided to go on a trip with him two weeks after she left. She asked me what i thought about her going on the trip. I said, ""You are doing so many wonderful things; focusing on yourself and making great plans. I don't think going on that trip is a good priority."" She went on the trip. I sent her good morning texts so she knows that she is wanted here. However, later, she used what I said against me and twisted my words. Repeatedly, she said that I said, ""You don't have your priorities in order."" Like that, I chastized her. She would look very sad, and my heart would drop.

After that, everything I did was wrong to her. I felt like I was going insane. She would roll her eyes at me and click her tongue. Eventually, I told her how I felt about how she was treating me. I was emotional. She expressed concern for me but then wanted to forget all about it and ""just have a good day"". She called me straight, even though she knows I'm not. Later, I did the thing you're not supposed to do, I begged her not to go back to him. I'm ashamed about that, I won't do that again. 

She also alluded to Jake saying bad things about me. I suspect in an attempt to cut me off and isolate her. Jake barely knows me. 

Phillis lived with me for a couple months. She went on more trips with Jake and other men. I kinda felt like a vacation home but didn't say anything. One day I come back from the grocery store and she was moving out. We talked, but to be honest she was distant and condescending. I don't think that was intentional, but I think she was in survival mode. A lot of her behavior was self-preservation. 

She said she was going to stay on different people's couches and that it turns out she has this ""great support system that she didn't know she had."" (One of the support people she listed SA her.) I offered our garage if she wants to store things. She said that wasn't necessary. I expressed that I was happy for her. Then, my boyfriend and I went out and gave her space to finish moving. 

I haven't confirmed that she moved back in with Jake, but I suspect. We haven't talked. I don't regret having her stay with us. I just don't know what to do. I worry about her safety every day. 

I know I can't make her leave, but I dont want to give up. I also don't want to get hurt. But I don't want to give up just because I might get hurt. I wasn't perfect in this situation, I want to be better. If anyone has any insite, stories, or advice they would like to share? 

Thank you so much if you read all this. 

TLDR: My best friend is in a domestic violence situation. She came to live with me. Her fiancée loved bombed her, and she started lashing out towards me. Now she moved out and I haven't heard from her. I'm worried about her safety.

Just getting right into it, but changing some of the finer details because I'm broke and need this job: I work at one location of a corporate medical practice, there are 30+ other locations in my state. I am the only administrative staff on site at my office and am in charge of essentially all of the admin tasks at this location. The state is split into regions and each region has about 4 offices, each with 1 person in my position, and a manager over the region. I've been here for about a year and half. I'll also say that this is the type of medical practice where we have regular clients, that mostly come weekly or biweekly for appointments

My office is part of a region that didn't have a local manager for several years, our management was located about 2 hours north in a bigger city and always changing. My office is also one of the largest/busiest in the state. Previous management visited about twice a year. We got a ""local"" manager about 2 months ago, she's based 45 minutes away and is in-office here about once a week.

Despite being one of the busiest offices, our building is pretty run down while the offices up North are really nice and renovated. I spent a lot of time trying to get someone in management to care when I first started, but no one really has. Occasionally promises would be made but never followed through with so me and the clinicians in my office gave up. 

I will say that our new manager, we'll go with Sharon, has made several positive changes, like new coffee makers and water coolers and reworking our phone system so I wasn't answering phones for the offices up North. But she also came in real hot, hating on aspects of our office that have always been in place and are now what our clients and the clinicians are comfortable with, such as the recliners we had and the fact that we have multiple copiers (?). The clinicians and clients are veeeerryy set in their ways and don't like change. I've tried to have conversations with Sharon about how certain decisions she makes will be taken by clients or clinicians and she always takes it as a personal attack; the clinicians have tried to have the conversation as well, but she percieves it as an attack every time. 

We're all a little hesitant to trust that good change will happen from everything in the past, and I will say that we have definitely come on strong in the past. I firmly believe that she was set up to fail by upper management, as they just dropped her in here without setting up meetings with any of the clinicians or explaining the history to her. The problem that I'm having specifically with Sharon is that she pretty much always makes everything veeerry personal when she feels that we're criticizing her, such as referring to having to take pills to deal with us or accusing the clinicians of poor clientcare based on how they treat her. 

The specific incident that I want to know if I'm overreacting to occurred this morning. She wanted to get rid of a section of our waiting room, we have clients that specifically only sit there (and a lot of our clients are autistic or otherwise can come in disregulaged) so I told her that it would be an issue for those clients and she felt attacked by that. I told her that this has been an issue in the past and she stated that me and the clinicians are all too stuck in the past. I saw that she was getting upset so I tried to calm her down by joking that she's right but we were maybe a little traumatized by our treatment in the past. She yelled (changing this slightly to not air out her traumas) ""Yeah, I was traumatized too when I was attacked and robbed by grown men!"" I basically froze and eventually just said ""I'm not sure how this is related to our conversation, but I'm not trying to criticize you."" She then went over to a nearby desk and had a loud teams call with a manager of a different region where she cried and talked about how hard it was to deal with us. 

My question is: would I be overreacting to report her to HR? My fear is that she has a history of spinning things (she called us all immature to our faces once and then denied it ever happened) and HR has a history of believing her word over everyone elses'. Everything is also completely fine when she's not in office. It's just that once a week visit when things hit the fan. ",3,1729717139.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

1gal1bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1gal1bg/lessons_learned_from_owning_garmin_and_apple/,Lessons learned from owning Garmin and Apple Watch at the same time,"Hey! It's just a quick feedback post I decided to share. Maybe it will help somebody looking at what to buy as their first smart watch and battling whether it should be AW or GW.

I've owned the very first AW, 38mm years ago. It was a terrible watch — battery couldn't last more than 10 hours. I was frustrated and optimised it to fight for every 1% that I could afford. 
Yep, it was that bad — the battery anxiety was my friend.
So eventually I have to give it away and wore a Casio G-shock for years.

Around 2 years ago, I decided to check out on the smart watch market given I got tired of interacting with the iPhone once a notification arrives. I want to see what it is instantly and discard it if it's not relevant otherwise I'll take action.

My first choice was not messing with Apple, because of the bad experience years before.

I chose Garmin Venu 2 as a balanced urban smartwatch that enables non-pro fitness things when you need it. As soon as Venu 3 was announced, I flipped Venu 2 to get my hands on a newer version.
Wore it for around a year up until the moment, I understood I lack a lot of stuff specific to the Apple ecosystem. So I got myself an AW SE2, budget model given I was still hesitant to waste serious money on something that failed me miserably in the past.

Here it goes, a sort of ""detailed"" nitpicky testimonial from a guy that rocks two of the watches during the day.  I do trust, that GW and AW can coexist for the same person given they solve different set of problems but it's a budget matter. 

The models that I had experience with are normal not top of the line — Apple Watch SE 2 Cellular vs Garmin Venu 3. For both scenarios, both watches were tested to operate independently of the smartphone except for in-house scenarios.


* **All things HR(V)**

I tested it like a nerd — by wearing both watches on my wrist, doing walks around the house to see who is faster on the heart rate updates. I did squats, rapid running on the stairs, fast walking, jogging to elevate the HR to a point where it would spike.

**Winner**: GW. Significantly faster updates the HR on the watch face. Doesn't have the AW overhead of waiting for the sensor to spin for 1-3 seconds to start displaying data. I think GW is a glorified heart rate monitor on the wrist. For HRV, the Apple Health app doesn't give a bottom line of what is a good HRV for my age, so you have to self-educate if it's in the ballpark of a norm. GW outperforms in the category by providing something like overnight HRV in Connect app that explains what is what. Never cared for training HRV though.

* **Workouts**

**Winner**: GW. I don't understand what is the problem for a trillion dollar valued company like Apple to display the standard moving speed in kmph/mph because I'm not an athlete to care about pace. So with GW, I can tune the Data Screen to have a real world speed and adjust my effort right away. Also, having Data Screens display whatever I require compared to AW workout screen. Auto-pause on GW is amazing allowing it to pause the workout once you stop or the pace drops below a user defined value and auto-resuming once you start moving again. It is a little bit too sensitive but AW SE2 provides nothing even close for jogging and walking like it yet I the double button start/stop press is a nice shortcut. The hand gesture to resume a paused workout would be nice if it would be working on a sweaty hand as good as on the dry one. I know that GW Venu 2/3 are ANT+ ready meaning they can be connected to the bike and act as a tracker giving much more precise info about cycling workouts.

* **Sleep**

**Winner**: close tie with me personally favoring GW little bit more. Up until WatchOS 11, AW could not comprehend when a person stays awake for a prolonged period of time during sleep focus and breaks out of the predefined sleep schedule. That would lead to messed up statistics, calculation, trends et cetera. It got better a little bit: you would see the first chunk of your sleep, a gap when you're awake for an hour or two then another sleep chunk, but if you reschedule the alarm — the extra time would display like a smudge. It can also detect naps, but only those that are 60+ minutes long (generally it's considered a long nap). GW does sleep tracking way better and is much more flexible once you need to re-set your alarm. 
Is the Naps feature useful on the Garmin? Well, for those who can afford a 20 minute nap with an alarm — it does given in counts towards the overall statistics. Is the Sleep Coach a useful thing? Not for me, I didn't find it useful at all and I'll explain why little bit later. But what GW does better than the AW is breaking the sleep into phases, detailing how much time did each phase take. This may be important for someone attempting to improve their Deep sleep phase.

* **Multitasking**

**Winner**: Apple Watch. Do you want to jump on a FaceTime audio or cell call while you're working out — you can do that with AW (Cell model). Do you want to *stream* a podcast once you end the call and still working out — AW Cellular can do that. Do you want to find the nearest pharmacy or figure out where you are and how to backtrack home if you wandered somewhere exploring the city without the smartphone — Apple Watch Cellular can do that too. Same goes for making new calendar events, texting, writing emails, marking tasks as completed and spawning new ones on the go, setting multiple timers while you cook multiple dishes minding to pick out laundry timer as well while seeing a live activity ETA of the Uber Eats delivery and tossing a coin with a dedicated app — Apple Watch can do all that. But the price you pay is battery life. My absolute record is 100% to 15% in 110 minutes: 45 minutes of FT audio on cellular during active Workout and then streaming a podcast while Workout was still running, the phone was left at the house. GW can do some of these things but it has very limited multitasking features. The closes you will get is listening to predownloaded podcasts/music while you're performing some sort of Activity. Switching back and forth between those is nowhere near to what Apple provides with their controls or hand gestures. What takes me 1-3 seconds to accomplish with AW, takes me 10-15 with GW.

* **Battery Life**

**Winner**: obviously GW. But do mind, if you want to turn GW into your music or podcast listening device — it will last slightly longer than the AW. But in defence of AW, the charging speed got much faster over the years. AW SE2 Cellular can get 0 to  80% in 60 minutes or less. With all batt draining features on, I was capable to rock it from 100% to 10% in 40 hours. For the lowest tier model that's a pretty impressive result!

* **Ecosystem support/integration**

**Winner**: obviously AW. Cellular models are capable to act as independent devices with a lot of autonomy. But what a lot of people don't really know, is that for the cell models to work properly, the iPhone that may be left at home should still be connected to the internet to push things like Whatsapp notifications and send back quick replies if the owner decides to respond. Yet, Apple Watch misses a key feature I love in Garmin — phone pickup feedback that fires once the callee actually picks up the phone, so you don't have to hold the smartphone speaker close to your ear. Why the heck can't Apple support the same form of haptic feedback is a mystery to me. For obvious reasons, Garmin's possibility to interact with incoming messages for both iPhone and Android is severely capped. You cannot respond or react to any incoming texts when paired to the iPhone, and you still have a quite limited capabilities with Android. Do remember, that Apple Health is a data harvester that can consume info from almost any type of smartwatch and consolidate it. I had a funny experiment of having sleep schedule recorded by two watches in the same night and Apple Health consolidated it to display the correct timeline of sleep phases and time amounts.

* **Final conclusions**

**Get yourself a Garmin** watch if you intend to use it for sleep tracking, workouts and you're obsessed with your pulse. Remember, without the nearby smartphone connected to the internet, most of the watch face widgets like temperature, precipitation, humidity will stop working — you will see stale data. There are apps available for Gamin like hydration tracker and intermittent fasting tracking but they are miserable in quality. 
It may be important if you consume large amount of caffeine, so that AW liquid tracking apps can extract caffeine share from coffee, energy drinks, tea etc and push it to Apple Health app that will tell you what are you caffeine intake trends which directly impacts your sleep quality, same liquid tracking apps decrease hydration levels once you consume alcohol so that you replenish the water level. Same goes for intermittent fasting apps. At the Garmin level they are just timers with simplest graphs possible, not adapting to sliding windows or the type of food you consume. You can't ask Garmin of things it cannot provide.

**Get yourself an Apple Watch** if you're in a habit building and self-organizing business and : learning new stuff, fasting, hydrating properly, making shopping lists/calendar events on the fly with the watch, completing reminders / attending calendar events, setting lots of timers through the day and even managing your daily vitamins/medications intake (Apple Health has a section for that) and you enjoy workouts that would make you put your watch to a charger for an additional 30 minutes per day. Also, if you love the freedom from your smartphone — cellular models are for you. That's an incredible long forgotten feeling I rediscovered.

I just recently discovered Pulp Fragrances and I am intrigued to try this brand. I need guidance choosing from this list. Would you add or subtract anything? Anything too similar? 

Embrace, South Star, Toasted Marshmallow, The Delicate Vice, Love At First Bite, Harvest Cakes, Fortune Favors, And To All A Good Night, Bewitching Amber, Vaniglia Prestissimo, El Baile De Los Muertos

My likes: I’m a sweet gourmand lover through and through. I love sweet vanillas; inviting , dark mysterious but still sweet vanillas; all things sweet bakery but not bread-y, sweet coffee, flourmands, I love spicy: think chai spices; ambers, and sweet woody cozy, comforting scents, vanilla musk, and most recently discovered a love of violet and Iris. 

My dislikes: bitter sharp scents, dirt, wet or damp air/wood/soil, motor oil, gunpowder, pine/evergreen forward scents that smell like they should be a candle, but not worn on the body (not exhaustive list but first that come to mind).   
  
My favorite indie perfumer hands down is Sorce aka Sorcellerie Apothecary. I have an extremely high success rate from her. My top 3 fragrances from Sorce are: What Big Eyes You Have, Strings of Light In The Forest, Moon Magic. Runner ups to make a top 5 list: Cabanilla and This Is Not A Lovespell

We agreed to have a date, everything was marching good, I was so excited, maybe even illusioned since he told me that wanted to hang out and enjoyed talking to me on snap ( we're both in college and living fairly close to each other).

I felt like everything was going OK I guess. I was trying to ask question and talk and making him talk too, I was trying to avoid those kind of awkward silence, I paid for his coffee and then we started talking about college life and how much we are struggling, but something inside of was telling me that this date turned out to be kinda weird/ awkward, i dont know if it was just me or what but i felt like i know what was coming , tried and tried and tried to engage a good convo until we finished our coffees ( He wasn't being dry). We've planned to walk somewhere else more private and have our more deep conversations but I wanted to make sure he wanted it so I asked "" What you wanna do now"" and the he said "" I want to go home, I have stuff to do"" ( I knew I fucked it up) at the end I walked him to his house and farewelled him by giving him a hug and the i said "" It was good meeting you and I hope to see ya later"". I went to my room and started crying so much, I was so hurt, I dont think this date took more than 20 minutes, I was so devastated. I texted him, Hey, I have so much fun today and I am so happy that i finally got to see ya, I am sorry if it was kinda awkward. he left me on delivered for like at least 3 hours, I checked on his grindr profile and he was online 2 hours ago. I tried to not desperate and then He texted me "" Thank you too! I had a lot of fun.

We are currently undergoing construction and our menu has been limited. We used to make coffee and foods like nachos, hotdogs, chili, etc. But due to the construction, we are working out of a small temporary space with no running water and no permits to make food or coffee. My manager, Sally, has found a caterer that makes us salads and sandwiches which we sell. They aren't super great, nor hot and they're kind of pricey, but it's the best we can do with a bad situation. 

Our team consists of Sally, myself (a cashier), a bike attendant, a stocker and one main tour guide driver, though we have a few others that work a few days a month. This being the case, Sally is the one to do the inventory, the payroll, purchasing, and getting stock onto the island. Sally wakes up at 4am to shop and be at the boat at 8:30 and then works and gets home at 7pm. We have tried to have me take on some of her load, but there is too much for her to get out from under to begin training. 

I don't know what her title is, but above Sally is Diana. Diana oversees us and a property in another state, so we don't see her often. Diana isn't understanding why our cash flow is so low. Nor does she understand why would we have so much variety in snacks. If it were her way, we'd have water, coke, diet coke, snickers, m&Ms and plain lays. Diana never had ANYTHING good to say. It's always criticism and it really brings Sally down. I love Sally to death. I value and respect her as my boss and truly see her as a friend and equal. 

How can I express to Diana that she doesn't know what she's talking about, she's gonna lose Sally and won't find anyone better? ",3,1729715674.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

Note: I am very new to writing. This is my first completed story. Please rip it apart.

\*\*\*

He was always tired, but never too tired to go through those tiny rituals. Even at the end, when the illness drained the strength from his limbs, he still brought his fingers to his face, brushing at his eyebrows with the same delicate touch. I think he knew they were growing out of place, but what did it matter? It was habit, comfort, a routine so ingrained that it continued when everything else fell away.

His fatigue crept up on us slowly, like the shadows lengthening in the late afternoon. At first, it was little things—a forgotten cup of coffee left cold on the kitchen counter, a stack of unopened mail gathering dust on the side table. Then, the effort of going outside seemed too great, and our evenings out became nights spent huddled on the couch, listening to old jazz records with the dim glow of the lamps softening the lines of his face. He’d close his eyes, and I’d stroke his shoulders, feeling the tension ease just for a moment.

The doctors never had clear answers, and I found myself spending sleepless nights trawling through medical articles, trying to understand the slow unraveling of his body. He never wanted to talk about it. He would dismiss my questions with a tired smile, say that he was just “getting older,” or make a joke about the inevitability of entropy. I hated that. I wanted reasons, clarity, a plan. But his silence became another part of our routine, just as the morning shoulder rubs had become, and I learned to fall in line.

The last time I held him, his skin was already cool. He’d been lying there, unmoving, for hours before I realized what had happened. I should have known—I should have felt the change, should have sensed the empty space where his breath used to be. But that morning, in the early hours before the sun had fully risen, I reached out as if he were still there. I moved my hand in those three familiar circles across his shoulder blades, waiting for the barely audible sigh that always followed. Nothing.

In the days that followed, the house felt vast and hollow, filled with echoes of conversations that had ended too soon. I avoided our bedroom, preferring the clutter of the kitchen with its half-finished projects and sticky countertops, evidence that life, however messy, had once thrived here. Every corner bore traces of him—the scarf draped over the back of the chair, his reading glasses, always a little askew, left on the windowsill. Each object felt sacred, and I dreaded the day I would have to move them, to pack away the little remnants that made him real.

The mail still piled up, unopened. The jazz records stayed in their sleeves. I found myself standing in front of the mirror, the way he used to, fingers hovering over my own eyebrows, wondering if I, too, had begun to fall apart in his absence.

Some days, I hear his footsteps in the hall or feel the warmth of his breath on my neck. The moments are fleeting, dissolving when I turn to look, but they’re enough to keep me tethered to this place. Enough to make me stay, for now.",2,1729715593.0,KeepWriting,2,0.76,False

I am relocating with my wife and three kids (all under 5) to Roswell from Columbus OH. We have secured a single family home in Martins Landing area. I went down to get some things settled in the house before the movers bring the bulk of our things. My wife has not seen the house in person yet.

I mainly wanted to ask about activities, events,  things we must see etc. My wife is a social butterfly , the kids have been enjoying preschool so this feels like a bitter sweet move. However it is for a dream job (located in midtown 3x a week with permission to start and end my day as needed). My wife and I met in Portland OR and lived in Asheville NC prior to Columbus. 

My family loves the outdoors, trying new restaurants (love burgers, sushi, pizza), love coffee etc. also love doing kid friendly events (forest schools, meet-up, story times etc). Any moms groups, women groups that my wife may enjoy to meet new friends would be great to know about. Also if anyone knows of any nature based, co-op or non mainstream preschools I’d love to know about them. Not opposed to regular schools but the kids have loved their nature based one this past year.

Any guidance, suggestions or encouragement is appreciated. I’m struggling a little bit with this move and want to make it as great an experience as possible for my family.

1gakdi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1gakdi2/best_cities_for_queer_millennial_leftists/,Best Cities for Queer Millennial Leftists,"I'm a 34 Black gay man, born and raised from Baltimore, MD. I've lived in Bmore my whole life and love my city. We have highly underrated food, arts, and music scenes as well as a consistently affordable housing market. We're also very much a neighborhood, community-oriented, working-class city. To many newcomers, this can come off as standofish tribalism. But it's truly about building trust and real relationships with those we share space with, in a city that has been vastly exploited, segregated, and ignored by those in power.

But I am *considering* a move to another city within the next few years. Living in Baltimore my whole life, I believe I'm overdue for a change of scenery and am excited contemplating what living elsewhere could offer.

I've been a paralegal for almost 7 years and am looking to make a career transition as a full-time restorative justice practitioner (I've been doing part-time gigs in the field for the past 2-3 yrs). I'd hope to find a full-time resotrative justice job where I'm making at least $70K a year. I am also a writer, and have begun recently dabbling in poetry and sharing my work at open-mic nights. I'm also a tarot reader and co-founder of a tarot collective here in Baltimore focused on utilizing tarot as a reflective tool to analyze what's going in Baltimore and around the world through a radical political lens. If I moved, I'd hope to share and expand this network in a new city. I also recently graduated with my bachelor's degree in Politics, Policy & International Affairs.

What I'm Looking For:

* A more racially diverse city: Baltimore is an intensely segregated city. While there are pockets of diversity here, I'd love to explore a city that is more ethnically diverse by nature. The segregation is so entrenched in Baltimore that the neighborhood disparities have been termed, ""The While L"" and ""Black Butterfly.""
* A larger city: Baltimore's community charm is one of its defining characteristics. But it can also be one of its most frustrating flaws. The ""Smalltimore"" effect is very real, meaning, that due to the size of the city, running into people you know with regular frequency, whether you want to or not, is routine. This can also make the queer dating scene here, which is already a minority in any locale, tedious to navigate.
* A global city: As mentioned before, Baltimore certainly has its pockets of diversity, but it is by no means a global city. I think I'm also referring to a vibe or an energy, in addition to demographic and cultural diversity.
* Politically engaged and leftist: I've been involved in various social movements in Baltimore for the past decade. There are lots of robust organizations, networks, and community groups engaging in inspiring activism and building power in marginalized, forgotten neighborhoods. However, outside of these very specific organizations, I can't say that political action is part of the city's culture. I think its likely due to always comparing ourselves to the overtly political culture of DC (which has always been viewed here as stuffy and eliitist). I'm looking for a city that has a more active, mobilized network of leftist political collectives, organizations, nonprofits, and co-operatives devoted to social change, and that are engaged in political work extending beyond electoral politics. Also, plenty of leftist coffee shops would be a nice touch.
* Affordable: One of the hardest things to leave behind in Baltimore would be its affordability in comparison to any major city in the Northeast. Its easy to find a sizeable house in a nice neighborhood here under $400K. I'm still a renter, paying around $1,300 in the downtown area of the city. I'd ideally like to live in a city where renting a 1 bedroom apartment, in a safe, queer friendly, culturally accessible area would still be doable for $1,100 - $1,400. I still can't wrap my mind around paying over $2,000 for a 1 bedroom apartment!
* Robust & Expansive Queer Community: Baltimore is a fairly progressive city with a sizeable queer community. My own chosen queer family I've made here is one of the biggest things keeping me in Baltimore. Building, especially with other queer peeps, is one of my defining values. While there are many queer people in Baltimore, I'd say that we may not be as visible as in other cities. Even though we're a Northeastern City, Baltimore is very characterized by Southern, small-town vibe. We're also a very churchy, religious town. Sadly, overtly homophobic attitudes or expressions can be encountered more often than not. We also have a very small established queer community - at this point in time. Most of Baltimore's gay bars have closed within the past decade and there are very few explicitly queer venues to choose from in terms of nightlife or dancing. Ideally, I'd like to explore a city with a larger, vibrant queer scene, that extends beyond nightlife, to other cultural venues like art, music,, books, politics. It would also be nice to find a city where there are more explicitily queer leftist venues to explore for political organizing and dating. There are a few spaces I know of that offer this in Baltimore but they're few and far between. Finding other leftists to date, while not mandatory, would be a nice breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, growing up in Baltimore, I've found that my overtly political interests usually make it challenging to forge bonds for romance. At least with the men I'm attracted to. But maybe this is just connected to the spaces I frequent and where I meet men?! I can say, I'd like to be in a city where it would be easy to meet a leftist, spiritually conscious, community-oriented, globally-minded man. Basically artists, musicians, creatives, fellow writers, and wierdos of all stripes.
* Public Transit Accessible: Baltimore's public transit system is *trash*. End of story lol. Luckily I live in an area that is located in a very walkable part of the city. But it's extremely difficult going to neighborhoods that aren't accessible to bus lines (a consequence of segregation). I'd like to live in a city where public transit is a norm and I wouldn't have to think about purchasing a car (although this is an eventual goal) to live comfortably in the city.
* Down to Earth: Another thing I'd really miss about Baltimore is our chill, communal vibe. While I can see myself being really stimulated by a larger city, I couldn't see myself living in a city that was standoffish or isolating as an acceptable tradeoff. I'd love to live in a city where it would be fair easy to build community with other millennials, particularly Black millennials and BIPOC queer peeps. Essentially, a city that is both global while also being neighborly. Community is my bread and butter.
* Cultured: I'm a nerd, so I love museums, bookstores, lectures, Rennaisance festivals lol, as well as great food, music, poetry, and artistic vneues. I've also been recently getting into the theatre more.
* Witchy: As mentioned above, I've been practicing withcraft for a little over the past 2 years. I've definitely been able to connect with other amazing witches here in Baltimore. But it would be nice to live in a city where witchy events, settings, and even venues are more visible. While more have been popping up in recent years, I still think it's hard for people here to adjust to because we're such a churchy city. Being able to join a real life coven would be amazing!

Potential Candidates: These are cities that I have either visited, explored, or that peak my interest as potential viable homes for me. I'll list them from level of interst, ranging from top to bottom.

* NYC: I've always fantasized about living in NY, specifically Brooklyn. It has a global cosmopolitan vibe like no other city in the US. And, I think I'd see it as being most likely I could find most of the points I listed above, in some form, in NY. Two of my best friends also live there. The major caveat is that the astronomical rent prices, and the average apartment size, hasn't been something I've been able to overcome as a barrier to consider another city, despite NYC's unique offerings.
* Philadelphia, PA: Philly reminds me of a bigger, more diverse Baltimore. It's equally affordable and seems as proportinally down to earth. My only concern is that it's so similar to Baltimore (even architcturally), that I don't know if it would constitute a major enough change for me. But the music, food, art, and social scenes are all calling to me! It also has a much bigger queer community. Also have family and friends who live there.
* Washington, DC: I've grown up going on daytrips to DC my entire life and have always been a fan of the city. It certainly has a distinct vibe from Baltimore: very professional, politically motivated, transient, and now gentrified culture is becoming the homogenous moniker of the city. DC rent prices are essentially on par with DC now but it seems like you actually get a little more space for your money there. DC has also been listed as th queerest city in America. Not sure how leftist it is though.
* Chicago, IL: I've been to Chicago three times (all for work conferences) and have always been enticed to explore more of the city. What I look is that it's definitely bigger than Baltimore, or even Philly, and seems much more diverse. Something tells me it would probably be slightly more expensive than Philly but cheaper, by far, than NYC. And the cultural, food, and arts scene has always looked compelling.

I'll add two last agenda items.

* I don't think I could ever live in a city that was in a Southern state. Even if the city was fairly progressive, I couldn't abide living in a conservative state with the increasing onslught against queer folks (specifically trans peeps) underway throughout the nation.
* I also need to live in a city that has four seasons. Fall is my favorite season and summer is my least favorite. With that being side, I don't see myself being cut out for West Coast life. Also, due to the effects of climate change, Baltimore rarely gets snow winters anymore. So it would be nice to be in a city that experiences snow at least semi-regularly.

That's everything, I know its ALOT! I would greatly appreciate insight, knowledge, and suggestions, especially about other locations I may not have mentioned above.",0,1729715012.0,SameGrassButGreener,62,0.41,False
1gakd09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1gakd09/star_trek_day_after_day/,Star Trek - Day After Day,"Captain Picard awoke to a quiet sense of peace. For the first time in what seemed like ages, there was no mission briefing, no diplomatic crisis, no galactic anomaly threatening the ship. He had a rare day off, and he decided to spend it doing something simple: reading. After taking care of a few routine matters, he pulled out one of his many treasured books, *Confessions* by St. Augustine, ready to lose himself in the ancient wisdom.

His breakfast was unremarkable, the usual fare from the replicator. The only disturbance was when a steward, clumsily, knocked over his coffee. Picard, ever the stoic, merely smiled, brushing the incident aside as a minor inconvenience. Later that morning, he attended a small meeting in the ready room. Data was going on about some new scientific development that soared far above Picard's head, but Picard, as he always did, nodded and took it in stride.

The rest of the day flowed smoothly, without any major issues. A small mishap in the evening when he knocked over one of his reading lamps was the only hiccup. It had been a peaceful, slow day—one where time seemed to stretch in his favor.

Before going to bed, he thought to himself, “Even for me, sometimes time is on my side.”

Just as he felt the warmth of sleep creep in, a familiar shimmer lit up his quarters. Q. Of course, Picard thought, inwardly groaning.

“What do you know about time, Captain?” Q asked, his voice dripping with amusement, before disappearing without another word.

Picard stared at the empty spot where Q had been, mulling over the cryptic question. Was it one of Q's philosophical jabs? He shook his head, dismissing it for the moment, and went to sleep.

Picard awoke again the next day, ready for a relaxing day. As he went through his morning routine, something felt... familiar. Too familiar. Still, he brushed off the feeling. He returned to his book, *Confessions*, enjoying its reflective passages.

At breakfast, the steward knocked over his coffee once again. Odd, but no reason to raise alarm. Picard, after all, was used to strange occurrences. He attended the same meeting, listening to Data discuss some scientific discoveries well beyond his comprehension. The day unfolded in an identical rhythm: another minor mishap with his reading lamp before bed, and the same thought—*Time is on my side*—whispering in his mind as he drifted off.

On the third day, Picard awoke with a gnawing sense of déjà vu. Once again, he went about his day: *Confessions* in hand, coffee spilled by the steward, Data’s incomprehensible science report, and the falling lamp. Everything played out exactly as it had before. The same events, the same conversations. He paused, trying to rationalize the situation, but it was too subtle to pin down as more than coincidence.

But by the fourth day, the truth was inescapable.

Picard shot upright in bed, his heart pounding as the fog of sleep lifted. It was happening again. The same day was repeating itself. He dressed quickly, his mind racing. Was this another one of Q’s tricks? Or was it something else? Time anomalies were not unknown in Starfleet’s history, but this was different—this was personal.

The entire day, once more, unfolded exactly as before. The same routine, the same mishaps. But now, Picard was keenly aware of the patterns. He deliberately knocked over the lamp that night, testing the boundaries of the loop.

No matter what he did, everything reset. When he slept, the day restarted. Time had imprisoned him in its endless cycle.

On the sixth day, Picard confronted Data during the morning briefing. “Data,” he began, carefully choosing his words, “what if someone were to experience the same day over and over? How would one escape that?”

Data’s brow furrowed. “If such a phenomenon occurred, Captain, one would need to identify the anomaly responsible. Temporal distortions, subspace disruptions, or even spatial anomalies could trap someone in such a loop.”

“Hypothetically, could a being like Q be responsible?” Picard asked.

“Q’s powers are beyond conventional understanding,” Data replied. “However, it is possible.”

After what felt like weeks of repetition, Picard realized he needed help. There was only one entity capable of such a reality-warping trick. He had avoided calling on Q for as long as possible, but if he were ever going to escape this cycle, he would have to confront him.

That evening, after once again knocking over his reading lamp, Picard spoke aloud into the empty room.

“All right, Q. I know you can hear me. Enough of this. Show yourself.”

The familiar blinding flash filled the room, and there stood Q, lounging casually in a chair that hadn’t been there a second earlier.

“Ah, Jean-Luc. Figured it out, did you?” Q said, smirking. “I must admit, you lasted longer than I expected before calling me.”

Picard glared. “What is this? Why am I reliving the same day over and over?”

Q grinned wider. “Oh, Captain, I thought you’d appreciate a bit of peace. You always seem so burdened by the weight of command. I decided to give you a gift—a day with no crises, no emergencies. Just endless tranquility.”

“Endless tranquility is not life, Q. It’s a prison.”

Q pouted in mock sadness. “Prison? I thought you enjoyed the luxury of time. After all, isn’t time what humans cherish most? And here I’ve given you an eternity of it!”

Picard took a step forward, his voice low and controlled. “You’ve taught me something, Q. Time, without progression, without change, is meaningless. We need time to move forward, to learn, to grow. Without that, we stagnate.”

Q’s expression shifted ever so slightly, his playful demeanor dimming. “So, you want out of my little game?”

“I’ve had enough, Q,” Picard said firmly. “Whatever lesson you were trying to impart, I’ve learned it. Now let me return to the flow of time.”

Q sighed dramatically, standing up. “Very well, Captain. If you insist.” He snapped his fingers, and the room seemed to shimmer around Picard. The air shifted, and Q’s voice echoed in the captain’s ears, “Just remember, Jean-Luc—time is never really on anyone’s side.”

The next morning, Picard woke up, his heart racing. He glanced around his quarters, half expecting the loop to continue. But there was something different—the air, the subtle hum of the ship, the light streaming through the window.

It was a new day. Finally.

Picard exhaled a deep breath of relief. He smiled softly, grateful for the return of time’s natural flow, and reached for his book. But this time, instead of opening *Confessions*, he put it aside.

","Me and my gf live together in my apartment on 3rd floor for nearing an year now. I absolutely love living with her but.. My gf,  an early riser, has this habit of slamming hard the wardrobe doors, bathroom doors and our balcony doors while closing them with a loud bang. This started to disturb me in early mornings in my deep sleep and woke me up with a sudden shock and even damaged our sliding balcony doors. Even after asking her multiple times to avoid it, this went on for months.   

My apartment being a family packed and pet friendly environment has a dedicated play area for kids and other amenities for folks to sit and watch the kids and pets playing which my balcony overlooks.   

I know that my gf needs her Saturday afternoon nap very badly and with utmost silence due to her diet and workout routine.   

So que in petty revenge.   

For the last few weeks, every time she starts to take her noon nap on Saturdays, I quietly go down to the bench to watch the kids playing football.        

Every time, the ball comes to my bench, I ensure to kick it to near my block and more precisely to the area under my apartment balcony.   

Now trust me, if you have not experienced the magnitude of noise when the kids are playing. It is massive. The sound have varying of frequencies from screeching to highest bass sound.   

As expected, within mins, I could see my gf out in the balcony with the grinchest face due to her sleep being disturbed, and worst of all trying to close the balcony door which is not closing fully, since she broke it with her habit of slamming hard.     

I time it right and ensure to kick the ball to my block so that I would be giving my gf to catch some sleep and to wake her with my small agents. Buhahhaaaa.   

I usually return to my apartment after an hour to seeing her sitting in couch with bloodshot red eyes and greet her with Hi Honey, you are up, do you need some coffee.

* With a forward P/E ratio near 22, the S&P 500 is expected to deliver only a 3% annualized return over the next three years. Historically, higher P/E ratios correlate with lower future returns.
* The current forward P/E ratio of 21.8 implies a subsequent 3-year return of just 2.9%. This suggests that today's market valuations are high, leading to modest returns.
* Investors should remain cautious, as overvaluation typically signals reduced future gains. High P/E ratios have often led to underperformance in the years that follow.

* The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, the first cut since 2020, signaling more cuts may follow. This rate cut is expected to help ease debt costs and improve deal flow in commercial real estate.
* Multifamily real estate saw $40 billion in transactions in Q2 2024, a 13.9% increase quarter-over-quarter, though still 9.4% lower than the previous year. The sector's absorption rate hit its highest in nearly three years, even as over 518,000 new rental units are expected by the end of 2024.
* The office market continues to struggle with high vacancy rates, now at 16.7%, despite positive net absorption of 2 million square feet in Q2 2024. Office prices in central business districts remain nearly 49% lower than pre-pandemic levels.

* The U.S. convenience store sector generated $860 billion in sales in 2023, with over 500,000 square feet leased last year, marking steady leasing activity. The total number of convenience stores increased by 1.5%, reaching over 152,000 stores nationwide.
* 65% of convenience store shoppers make unplanned purchases, with popular impulse buys being bottled coffee (70%), energy drinks (67%), and pre-packaged snacks (65.6%). These stores are becoming key testing grounds for new product launches, tapping into the growing demand for quick, convenient options.
* Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is becoming a focus for C-stores, as industry leaders like Love’s Travel Stops invest $1 billion to update locations with open-air designs and EV stations. BP, Wawa, and Sheetz are also boosting EV infrastructure, while 7-Eleven plans to rebrand and close 444 underperforming stores in response to inflation-driven sales challenges.

* As of September 2024, the median US rental household spends about 30% of their income on rent, a threshold considered affordable. Wages have increased by 17.6% since 2021, helping keep rental affordability steady despite rising rent costs.
* Rental concessions are rising, with 35.8% of listings offering deals like free rent or waived fees — the highest since February 2021. Property managers are using these incentives to fill vacancies ahead of the slow fall and winter seasons.
* Rent growth has cooled to 3.3% nationally, with declines in 21 major metros. However, only eight cities, including Miami and New York, maintain rental affordability levels above 30%.

* Inventory of unsold single-family homes dropped to 732,000 this week, a decrease of 0.25%. This marks a 34% increase compared to last year, but with a recent narrowing gap as inventory was 40% higher just a few weeks ago.
* New listings increased to 63,000, about 8% higher than last year’s figures. However, pent-up seller supply remains largely restricted due to high mortgage rates and market uncertainties.
* The median home price for new contracts this week was $389,000, down 1.5%. Despite weak sales over the past two years, home prices have remained resilient, with recent gains fueled by slight dips in mortgage rates.

* As of August 2024, about 350,000 student-competitive beds sat vacant across the U.S., a significant jump from the low vacancy in 2021 and 2022. This shadow market gives student renters more choices for housing near campuses.
* By August 2023, the number of vacant student-competitive beds rose by 27% to 325,000 compared to the previous year. This increase reflects a slowdown in housing demand across campuses as the class of 2020 neared graduation.
* Competitive vacancy growth has leveled off in Fall 2024 with only 25,000 more vacant beds than at the start of the year. This results in about 8% more available beds over last year, spreading student demand across different housing options.

* Families are increasingly renting instead of buying due to high mortgage rates and housing shortages, especially in cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Miami. Renting can offer relief from homeownership headaches like maintenance, while still providing a high quality of life through upscale amenities.
* Developers are closing the gap between rental and condo buildings by offering comparable finishes and high-end amenities like pools, playgrounds, and designer interiors. This has made renting more attractive to families who seek luxury living without the financial commitment of buying.
* High-end rental buildings, such as One Bennett Park in Chicago and One Thousand One in Philadelphia, provide family-friendly amenities like children’s rooms, playgrounds, and event spaces. These features cater to the growing demand for larger, family-oriented apartments.

I (f, 24) was out drinking with my friend (f, 23). She's had a crush on this guy for months, but it didn't turn into anything. She tried to ask him out many times but either he was busy or wouldn't accept. 

The only times they talked in these last 6 months was a few times in university, maybe they had coffee or lunch with also other friends/acquantances. So still really not sure if he likes her or not. 

Finally this time when we are out drinking he accepted and joined with his friends. My friend was hyped but got really nervous and didn't make much conversation/effort towards him. He also seemed not to care too much. 

After the night, I followed him and his friend on instagram, for me it seemed normal, I do it when I meet or hang out with new people. My friend got mad at me. Then, I went to study in a library and by chance I ran into the crush. We studied together and that night he texted me asking to borrow a book that we previously talked about. I accepted, but also told my friend about it. 
She got mad at me again saying it was my fault I got into that situation.


My perspective is that I realized I might start to like him, but also I don't want to take any steps before I talk with friend or before he makes it clear if he has any interest on me or her (could be neither of us). But even now that I basically didn't make any ""move"", my friend is already not talking to me anymore. 

How can I be mature about it and talk with her if she's not replying anymore ? Am I the AH for even maybe liking this guy in the first place, when she didn't make any moves for 6 months? ",1,1729714409.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

I met Brenda for a coffee before we talked nuru. This was earlier in 2024 when I first started promoting the girls, and she wanted to play it safe with me as other promo pages don't have the cleanest records. As for the session, I can say Brenda is by far one of the flirtiest in the industry. She takes her time with her clients, she is very accommodating, and has always been incredibly professional. Although I do see more of her freaky and fun side, that's more due to the relationship we’ve developed. Brenda has a lot of fans, so don't waste her time, and go visit her.
