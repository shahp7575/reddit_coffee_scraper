1jb4ob6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jb4ob6/went_to_my_first_meeting_last_night_and_still/,Went to my first meeting last night and still drank after.,"As the title says, I went to my first meeting last night. I was terrified walking in but it went well. A man approached me during the halfway interval/smoke break. He introduced himself to me and said he had never seen me before and I told him it was my first ever meeting. He was overjoyed that I took the first step and gave me his number and took mine. He told me he goes to meetings every week and he would like to call me tomorrow to meet for a coffee. I took him up on his offer and said I would answer his call. 

The trouble is, I'm such a piece of shit alcoholic that after the meeting for whatever reason I went to the liquor store. I drank myself stupid last night. What the fuck is wrong with me. Why can I not shake this shit. Why am I so preoccupied and obsessed with getting buzzed. I literally have nothing else in my life but alcohol and I keep crawling back like an abused wife. I feel like my entire 20's have been lost to alcohol addiction. ",3,1741961097.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Seed starting season continues, so why not keep swapping seeds with fellow gardeners and meeting some like-minded folks? Whether you’re a seasoned (and weathered) Colorado gardener, a patio gardener, or someone  who wants to start your gardening adventure, ALL ARE WELCOME!  I have so many seeds left over from last time, too, that you should come whether you’re have anything to swap or not.

Here are the details:

**Where**: Sonder Coffee & Tea - 2000 S. Colorado Blvd., Denver, CO 80222 (in Junction Food Hall). This is adjacent to the Colorado Station public transit stop and there’s lots of parking, too.

**When**: Sunday, March 16 from 9a - 12p

**What**: A garden vegetable, herb, and flower seed swap. If you have seeds that you don’t plan to use or have excess of, bring them! Or, even if you don’t have seeds but want to be part of Community, feel free to join! (And everyone should feel free to give of their excess).

**Who**: You, the person reading this. And anyone else you think would be into this.

**How**: Bring little baggies (no judgement) or  envelopes or some other type of container to take away the seeds. 

**Why**: Because gardening is a form of resilience, resistance, and helps create community! (And that’s what I need right now ☺️)

I hope folks can join!",1,1741960876.0,Denver,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jb4507,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mr_Grim/comments/1jb4507/i_am_a_detective_investigating_a_murder_in_a/,"I am a Detective Investigating a Murder in a Rural Louisiana Town, The town has STRANGE RULES !","The girl was seventeen years old when they found her, laid out like a broken offering on the edge of the swamp. Her name was Abigail ""Abby"" Thorne, daughter of a single mother, last seen leaving her part-time job at Waylon’s Gas & Grocery two nights before.

The way she was found—stripped to the bone in some places, untouched in others, hands placed neatly over her chest like she had been posed—made it clear this was something different. Not just a murder. A message.

I arrived in St. Mercier, Louisiana, on a gray October morning, driving down a two-lane road flanked by bald cypress trees, the kind that loom like twisted sentinels over the waterlogged earth. The town sat near the edge of the Atchafalaya Basin, where the land felt more like forgotten swamp than civilization. I passed abandoned sugar mills, their rusted skeletons still standing against the sky, and trailer homes with Virgin Mary statues out front, half-sunk into the ground from years of flooding.

St. Mercier wasn’t much. A gas station, a church, a handful of businesses clinging to the edges of Main Street, and beyond that—a sprawl of farmland and dense, unnavigable marshes. The kind of place where people didn’t talk to strangers and the law was more of a suggestion than a rule.

Sheriff Earl Duvall, a man in his sixties with the kind of face carved by cigarettes and bad sleep, met me at the town's only diner. He pushed a black-and-white crime scene photo across the table—Abby Thorne, arms crossed over her bare chest, her eyes gone.

""The crows?"" I asked.

He shook his head. ""No crows touched her. No gators either. We found her like that."" He tapped the photo. ""The eyes weren’t taken by animals, Detective. They were scooped out. And whoever did it, they left her that way on purpose.""

I had seen plenty of dead bodies in my time, but something about this one felt different.

“Locals say she broke the rules,” Duvall muttered, stirring his coffee absently.

I frowned. “Rules?”

He exhaled heavily, leaning back in his chair. “Every town’s got superstitions. This one just takes ‘em a little more seriously.”

Before I could press him, the waitress—a gaunt woman with deep-set eyes who looked like she hadn't smiled in a decade—came by to refill our coffee. She didn’t look at me as she poured, but her hand trembled slightly.

“You’re investigating the girl, ain’t you?” she muttered, voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded.

She hesitated, then leaned in slightly.

“You should go back to Baton Rouge, detective. This town don’t like it when outsiders start asking questions.”

I glanced at Duvall, but the sheriff was suddenly real interested in his plate of eggs.

Something was wrong here.

The girl was dead. The town had rules. And whatever they were, I had the sinking feeling that Abby Thorne had broken one.

The road leading to Abigail Thorne’s crime scene was barely a road at all—just a stretch of packed dirt and gravel, winding through dense cypress trees, the branches so thick overhead they swallowed most of the daylight. Spanish moss hung like tattered curtains, swaying lazily in the humid breeze. The air smelled of wet earth and something else—something sour.

Sheriff Duvall drove in silence, his hands gripping the wheel like he was bracing for something. I watched the trees pass by, but I wasn’t just looking at them. I was feeling them.

Something about this place was off.

The deeper we drove, the heavier the air felt. The silence wasn’t just quiet—it was waiting.

We finally stopped near an overgrown clearing, just a few yards away from the edge of an abandoned sugarcane field. A single stretch of yellow crime scene tape fluttered uselessly in the breeze.

“She was found here?” I asked.

Duvall nodded but didn’t move to get out.

I stepped out of the car first. The heat was thick, suffocating, and the smell of stagnant water clung to my skin. The grass was flattened, the soil still dark where the girl’s body had been found.

No footprints. No drag marks.

Just like someone had placed her there.

Duvall climbed out, clearing his throat. “Something I oughta tell you, Detective,” he muttered.

I looked up.

“Folks in this town… they got ways of thinking. Ways that ain’t always modern.”

I studied his face. “Meaning?”

He exhaled, then reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, folded piece of paper. It was old, stained in places, like it had been passed through too many hands.

I took it. Unfolded it.

Inside were rules :

**The Laws of St. Mercier (To Be Followed Without Question) :**

1. **If you find a door in the woods, do not open it. No one builds doors without walls.**
2. **Never bring back anything taken from the water. Some things are meant to stay drowned.**
3. **If you hear your name whispered from the cane fields, do not answer. It is not calling you—it is remembering you.**
4. **On the first Sunday of every month, every house must leave an offering on the porch before midnight. It does not matter if you believe. It matters that it believes.**
5. **There is a house at the end of Red Creek Road. No one lives there. No one ever has. If a candle burns in the window, do not look at it. If the door is open, do not go inside.**
6. **If you wake up to the sound of someone moving in your home, do not search for them. They have already seen you.**
7. **The missing do not return. If you see them again, they are not yours anymore.**

A cold sensation crept over my skin.

I looked up at Duvall, half-expecting a smirk. Some kind of joke. But he just stood there, staring at me like he was waiting for me to understand.

“What does this have to do with Abby?” I asked.

He nodded toward the edge of the clearing.

Beyond the tall grass, past the trees, the sugarcane field stretched out like an ocean of green. I followed his gaze until I saw it—something small, half-hidden in the dirt.

I walked closer, crouched down.

It was a door.

Old. Wooden. Covered in faded carvings.

And half-buried in the ground.

A door without walls.

I turned back to Duvall. “Did she open it?”

His face was pale, his jaw tight. He didn’t answer.

But I already knew.

Abigail Thorne opened the door.

And something came through.

I took photos of the door, brushing away dirt to get a better look at the carvings. They weren’t just random scratches—they were symbols. Strange, looping marks that almost looked like letters, but not in any language I knew. The wood was warped, swollen with time, and there was no handle.

It didn’t belong here.

I turned back to Sheriff Duvall, who stood stiffly near the car, watching me like he didn’t want to get any closer.

“This was here before Abby died?” I asked.

Duvall hesitated, then gave a slight nod. “Far as I know.”

“You didn’t think to mention it before?”

Another pause. Then, quietly—“I didn’t want to.”

I didn’t push him. Not yet.

Instead, I took one last look at the door before we left.

The thought stayed with me as we drove back toward town, the road weaving through miles of flat, open land, past rotting barns and crumbling houses, places long abandoned but still standing like silent watchers.

I needed to know more about Abigail Thorne.

Waylon’s Gas & Grocery - Last Place She Was Seen Alive

Waylon’s sat at the edge of town, a small, dusty gas station with a general store attached, the kind of place where the shelves carried equal parts beer, motor oil, and hunting knives. The windows were clouded with age, the walls lined with old yellowing posters for church raffles and missing dogs.

Inside, a thin, red-eyed girl at the register barely looked up when I walked in. Name tag: Katie.

I set my badge on the counter. “You were friends with Abby?”

She swallowed. “I worked with her.”

I nodded. “She came through here the night she disappeared?”

Katie fidgeted, glancing toward the back of the store. Like she was checking to see if we were alone.

I leaned in. “Listen, I’m not from here. I don’t care what stories people tell. I care about who killed your friend.”

She hesitated, then leaned forward, voice barely a whisper.

“She was scared.”

A chill ran through me.

“Scared of what?”

Katie’s fingers trembled as she traced an invisible shape on the counter.

“A week before she died,” she said, “Abby started saying she found something out near the cane fields. Said it wasn’t right. She kept asking people about it, but no one would answer her.”

I could already guess what it was.

“The door.”

Katie flinched at the word. “She wanted to know what was behind it.”

I stared at her, waiting.

She swallowed hard. “Then she started talking about opening it.”

Something heavy settled in my gut.

“What happened next?”

Katie’s gaze darted toward the door, like she was afraid someone would walk in. “Three nights before she went missing, she told me she… she had a dream.”

I frowned. “What kind of dream?”

Katie licked her lips. Her voice dropped to barely a whisper.

“She saw something coming out of it.”

I felt a sharp prickle of unease at the back of my neck.

“And then?”

Katie’s breath was shaky. “She said when she woke up… there was dirt in her bed. Under her fingernails. In her mouth. Like she had already been there.”

She had opened it.

Whether she meant to or not.

I turned back toward the door. I needed to get out there again. Needed to see for myself.

Because whatever Abby had found…

It wasn’t done yet.

The drive back to the crime scene felt different this time.

Before, I had looked at it like a detective—examining evidence, measuring possibilities. Now, I was looking at it like Abby must have.

Like something was waiting there.

I parked at the edge of the clearing, stepping out into the heavy, humid air. The trees swayed lazily in the breeze, the smell of damp soil and stagnant water thick in my lungs. The cane fields loomed just beyond the clearing, their green stalks rustling like something breathing.

Duvall wasn’t with me this time.

I preferred it that way.

I walked to the spot where Abby’s body had been found. The ground was still disturbed from where forensics had worked, but something else caught my attention.

Footprints.

Not hers. Bare. Large. Deep.

Someone had been here after the crime scene was processed.

Or something.

I crouched, running my fingers through the indentations. They were spaced too far apart. Too long. Like whoever—or whatever—had walked here wasn’t moving like a person.

A noise clicked in the trees behind me.

I stood up fast, heart hammering.

The forest was still.

But the air had changed.

Something was wrong.

I turned slowly, scanning the trees. The door was still there, half-buried in the ground, its carvings seeming darker now, deeper. A thin layer of dust had settled over it, except for one part—the center.

Where it had been touched.

I stepped toward it cautiously, my boots crunching over dry leaves. The closer I got, the heavier the air became. It wasn’t just the humidity—it was pressure.

Like the whole damn forest was holding its breath.

I crouched beside the door, reaching out. My fingers brushed the carvings—deep grooves, too precise for age to have worn them away. And then I saw something else.

Something small, wedged in the dirt near the edge of the door.

A fingernail.

I swallowed hard. It was chipped, torn at the edge, the tip stained dark. Dried blood.

Abby’s?

No.

The blood was fresh.

A crackle in the trees behind me.

I spun, hand reaching for my gun. The cane fields stretched out before me, silent and swaying. But something had moved.

The sugarcane stalks on the edge were bent outward.

Like something had walked through.

And then I heard it.

A sound I didn’t want to believe.

A slow exhale. Wet. Ragged.

Something was in the field. Watching.

My grip on my gun tightened. I took a slow step back toward my car, keeping my eyes locked on the broken stalks.

A shadow shifted.

Tall. Thin. Not quite right.

And then, just as I took another step—

The cane moved.

Something stepped back into the field.

I stood there, heart hammering in my chest, my body screaming at me to move. But I didn’t. I just listened as the rustling faded.

And then the forest was still again.

Like nothing had ever been there.

But I knew better.

Something had stepped through.

And it hadn’t gone back.

I didn’t go straight back to the station.

Instead, I drove through town, past the empty streets and shuttered businesses, past the sagging porches where old men sat in silence, staring at nothing. The kind of town where people lived close together but still felt alone.

Waylon’s Gas & Grocery was open, but I didn’t stop. Katie had told me everything she could.

I needed someone who wasn’t afraid to lie to me.

So I went to the church.

St. Mercier Parish, a crumbling brick building with peeling white paint and stained-glass windows that had darkened with age, sat just beyond the center of town. The cemetery beside it stretched toward the bayou, half-flooded, tombstones leaning as if sinking into the marsh.

Father Etienne Rousseau had been the town’s priest for nearly forty years. A man who had watched generations come and go, burying more people than he baptized.

When I found him, he was sitting on a wooden bench beneath the massive oak tree behind the church, rolling a cigarette with steady, wrinkled hands.

He didn’t look at me as I approached. “Afternoon, Detective.”

I sat beside him. “You heard what happened to Abigail Thorne.”

A slow nod. “Tragedy.”

I studied his face. “You don’t seem surprised.”

Another pause. Then, in a voice dry as dust—“I am too old for surprises.”

I pulled the folded piece of paper from my pocket, the one with the town’s rules, and smoothed it out between us on the bench. His eyes flickered toward it, just once, before he looked away.

“Someone gave me this,” I said. “Abby broke one, didn’t she?”

Rousseau took a slow drag of his cigarette. “It does not matter what she did,” he said simply. “Only what was done to her.”

“What does the door lead to?” I asked.

Rousseau sighed, tapping ash onto the ground. “It does not lead anywhere,” he murmured. “It lets something out.”

I exhaled sharply. “What did she let out?”

The old priest turned to me then, and there was something deep and tired in his gaze.

“She did not let it out,” he said. “She just reminded it that it was here.”

A heavy silence settled between us.

Finally, I folded the paper again, slipping it back into my pocket.

“Who put the door there?” I asked.

Father Rousseau didn’t answer right away. Instead, he gestured toward the flooded graveyard beside the church.

“You see the water creeping up?” he asked. “Every year, it rises a little more. Bury the dead deep as you want—eventually, the swamp pulls them back.”

I frowned. “What does that have to do with anything?”

His eyes darkened.

“The door was put there to cover something up. But the ground shifts, the years pass, and things that were buried don’t always stay that way.”

The hair on the back of my neck stood up.

I stood, adjusting my belt, ready to leave, but before I could step away, Rousseau grabbed my wrist.

His grip was thin, but strong.

“Do not look for it at night,” he whispered. “If you hear it moving, you didn’t hear anything. If you feel it watching you, you are wrong.”

His fingers tightened.

“And if you wake up with dirt in your mouth—leave St. Mercier.”

I pulled away, heart pounding.

I left without another word.

The sun was starting to set, and as I got into my car, I realized something.

For the first time since I arrived in St. Mercier…

I did not want to be here after dark.

I didn’t go back to the station.

I didn’t go back to the crime scene.

I drove to the motel on the outskirts of town, the kind of place that smelled like mildew and bad decisions, where the neon “VACANCY” sign flickered weakly in the humid night.

Room 6A. It wasn’t much. A bed, a chipped wooden desk, and a bathroom with a mirror that had seen too many faces. I bolted the door behind me, tossed my keys on the table, and collapsed onto the mattress.

The day weighed on me like a second skin.

The crime scene. The footprints. The door in the woods.

Father Rousseau’s warning.

“If you wake up with dirt in your mouth—leave St. Mercier.”

I ran a hand over my face. I needed a drink. I needed to think.

Instead, I stared at the ceiling, listening to the motel hum with its own strange life. The buzzing of the overhead light. The distant chirp of cicadas outside. The hollow quiet of a town that didn’t want me here.

Somewhere around 2 AM, I must have dozed off.

I woke up with the taste of dirt on my tongue.

My eyes snapped open.

For a long second, I just lay there, heartbeat hammering in my ears. The motel room was dark, but something felt wrong.

My mouth was dry. Gritty.

I sat up slowly, swallowing hard. The taste was unmistakable.

Soil.

I reached up, touching my lips, then ran my fingers over my tongue. I spat onto my palm.

Dark flecks of earth.

The motel was locked. No windows open. No way I could have brought it in.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed, every muscle tense. The old wooden floor was cold under my feet. I scanned the room, pulse pounding.

Everything looked the same. The chair, the desk, the crumpled sheets.

Then I saw it.

Something was wrong with the door.

I stood slowly, moving toward it, hands clenched into fists. The doorknob was still bolted, but…

The wood was marked.

A black handprint, smeared across the center of the door.

Not a full hand. Just four long fingers.

Like someone had pressed against the wood from the outside.

But that wasn’t what made my breath catch in my throat.

The fingers were too long.

I took a slow step back, heart hammering. The air in the motel room felt thick, too still.

Something had been here.

Something had touched my door.

And as I stood there, staring at the mark, another realization crept over me, curling like a cold hand around my throat.

The dirt in my mouth.

The last thing Abby Thorne told her friend before she died.

“I woke up with dirt in my bed. Under my fingernails. In my mouth.”

She had opened the door.

And now it knew me, too.

By the time the sun rose, I had already packed my bag.

I hadn’t slept.

I sat on the edge of the motel bed, watching the light creep through the thin curtains, painting the room in muted gold. The black handprint was still on the door. The dirt in my mouth still clung to my teeth.

I needed answers.

So I drove.

Sheriff Duvall’s office was a small, sun-bleached building at the center of town, just a few doors down from a barber shop that had long since given up on customers and a post office that only opened three days a week.

I pushed through the door.

Duvall looked up from his desk, his eyes tired, bloodshot.

“You look like hell, Detective.”

I tossed a photo of my motel door onto his desk—the black handprint clear as day.

His face didn’t change.

“I want to know who did this.”

He leaned back in his chair, rubbing his jaw. “Who says it was done by someone?”

I exhaled sharply. “You trying to tell me it just appeared on its own?”

Duvall said nothing.

I sat down, voice low. “This isn’t just a murder, is it?”

He shifted, like he was fighting himself. Then, finally—“You think this is the first time something like this happened?”

My fingers curled into fists. “How many?”

Duvall’s jaw tightened. “More than I care to count.”

I leaned in. “Abby didn’t just break the rules, Sheriff. She uncovered something. Something you all know is real.”

His eyes darkened. “And what exactly do you think you’re gonna do with that information?”

I didn’t have an answer.

Because the truth was, I didn’t know what the hell I was chasing anymore.

I stood up. “I’m going back to the door.”

Duvall’s face hardened. “No, you’re not.”

Something cold passed between us.

Then I heard it.

A car pulling up outside. Then another.

I turned. Through the window, I saw two trucks parked in front of the station. Three men climbed out—locals.

They weren’t here for small talk.

I looked back at Duvall. He sighed, rubbing his temples.

“This ain’t personal, Detective,” he muttered. “But you don’t belong here.”

I knew that look.

I had seen it in other places, in other cases. The look of a man who wasn’t in charge of his own town anymore.

I glanced back at the men outside. They weren’t holding weapons, but they didn’t need to. This was a warning.

A final one.

I grabbed my badge off his desk and walked to the door.

As I passed Duvall, he spoke one last time.

“Go home.”

I stepped outside.

The men didn’t move, but their eyes followed me. Unblinking. Unfriendly.

I got in my car, turned the key.

And I drove.

Not out of town.

Not to the motel.

Back to the woods.

Back to the door.

Because whatever they were trying to hide…

I needed to see it for myself.

The drive back to the woods felt unending.

The road was the same—narrow, cracked, framed by sagging trees heavy with moss—but the air had changed, like it was pressing against the car, pushing me back.

I didn’t turn around.

The town had made their threat clear. They wanted me gone.

But I had to see.

I pulled off onto the dirt path, killing my headlights as I rolled to a stop. The forest stretched out before me, dark and endless. The cane fields rustled in the breeze, whispering against themselves.

The sun had almost set.

And I had made the mistake of coming alone.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped out, boots sinking into the soft, damp earth. Every step toward the clearing felt like pushing against a current, like the very ground was trying to drag me back.

I reached the tree line.

The door was still there.

Half-buried in the dirt, its carvings darker now in the fading light. The ground around it was disturbed.

Not just from me.

Something had been here again.

A thin trail of footprints, leading from the door back into the cane fields. Deep. Uneven. Like someone had crawled their way out.

The back of my neck prickled. I turned slowly, scanning the stalks. The light from my flashlight caught nothing but the endless rows of green.

But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it.

I swallowed hard and crouched by the door, running my fingers over the carvings. The wood was warm. Like it had been touched recently.

Or opened.

A noise clicked behind me.

I stood up fast, turning toward the field.

The stalks shifted.

Not the wind. Not an animal. Something tall. Moving.

I lifted the flashlight. “Who’s there?”

The wind picked up. The cane groaned.

Then I saw it.

Not a person.

Not an animal.

Something wrong.

It stood just beyond the first row of cane, tall and thin, its arms too long, its head tilted slightly—like it was listening.

I couldn’t see its face.

Or maybe it didn’t have one.

My breath hitched. My body screamed at me to run, to move—but I couldn’t.

Because it was already moving toward me.

Like it knew I wouldn’t leave.

Like it had been waiting for me.

My legs unlocked. I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the door. The thing stopped.

Then it did something worse.

It lowered itself.

Not like a person crouching. More like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Its limbs bent wrong, folding in on themselves.

And then—it reached out.

Its fingers—too many fingers—dragged through the dirt toward the door.

A sharp crack sounded in the distance. A gunshot.

The thing jerked upright.

Another shot. This time closer.

I turned, heart hammering—Duvall was standing at the tree line, shotgun raised.

“Move, goddammit!” he shouted.

I didn’t hesitate. I ran.

The thing in the cane didn’t follow.

It just stood there, watching.

Watching like it knew something I didn’t.

And as I ran back toward my car, the last thing I saw was its hand still resting on the door.

Like it was waiting for someone else to open it.

I left St. Mercier the next morning.

Duvall never said a word about what he saw. Neither did I. We just sat in his truck as the sun rose, drinking bad coffee and listening to the swamp breathe.

It was understood—I wasn’t staying.

They let me leave.

I drove past the abandoned sugar mills, past the houses sinking into the mud, past the town that had decided long ago that some things were better left buried.

But that night, at a cheap motel an hour outside Baton Rouge, I woke up with dirt in my mouth.

I sat up fast, heart hammering, spitting into my hands. Dark flecks of soil. Under my fingernails. In my teeth.

The sheets were clean. The floor untouched. But I knew.

I knew it hadn’t let me go.

For a long time, I just sat there, breathing.

Then I checked the door.

Locked. Bolted.

But that wasn’t what made me stop.

On the wood, just below the handle—

A black handprint.

The same mark from my motel door in St. Mercier.

Only this time, there was something different.

A smudge near the fingertips. Like whoever—or whatever—had left it had pressed harder.

Like it was getting closer.

I stood there, my body cold despite the thick Louisiana heat, staring at the mark.

And I realized something.

I never saw Abby’s body up close. I saw photos, reports, witness statements.

But not her.

Not what was left.

I thought about what Father Rousseau said.

“The missing do not return. If you see them again, they are not yours anymore.”

Abigail Thorne had been found in the clearing.

But had it really been her?

Or had something else crawled through that door wearing her name?

I swallowed hard.

Outside, the motel parking lot was quiet.

But I didn’t open the door.

Because I had the terrible, sinking feeling that if I did…

Something would be waiting for me.

Something that had been watching since I left.

Something that wasn’t finished yet.

And this time—

It might not let me go.",1,1741959593.0,Mr_Grim,0,1.0,False

**When**: Sunday, March 16 from 9a - 12p

**What**: A garden vegetable, herb, and flower seed swap. If you have seeds that you don’t plan to use or have excess of, bring them! Or, even if you don’t have seeds but want to be part of Community, feel free to join! (And everyone should feel free to give of their excess).

**Who**: You, the person reading this. And anyone else you think would be into this.

**How**: Bring little baggies (no judgement) or  envelopes or some other type of container to take away the seeds. 

**Why**: Because gardening is a form of resilience, resistance, and helps create community! (And that’s what I need right now ☺️)

1jb424i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1jb424i/what_is_going_one_with_me/,What is going one with me??,"Okay so. I (19f) have been struggling with these “sleep attacks” in the past few weeks but this requires some context. 

Growing up I was always super tired and fatigue and ended getting diagnosed with POTS when I was 12 which I thankfully grew out of. Also I was an insomniac as a little kid. But being tired was kind of my art form even after that. I remember spending most of my science classes in sophomore year FIGHTING for my life trying to stay awake as if I was trying not to puke. My science teacher was very boring though, so I never thought too much of it despite how horrible the feeling was. I don’t remember much of junior year because I was too busy being an emo drug addict that ultimately led me to have to go to a rehab centre where I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication for it. 

Because of the medication (vyvanse) I didn’t struggle so much with in senior year with trying to stay awake in classes, but I would always have to take naps after school but that doesn’t seem super out of the ordinary since a lot of my friends also did the same (I went to a boarding school). 

My vyvanse dosage was eventually upped to 40 mg when I started first year of university. I basically didn’t go to my lectures at all because whenever I did I would get attacked with sleepiness and couldn’t ever pay attention so I thought ‘what’s the point?’ Even when I would go to class every once in awhile, I remember that I had to take a nap as soon as I got back to my room around 1:30 pm as if it was clockwork. I never really thought much of it but looking back now, this shouldn’t be the case for someone who’s on a relatively high dose of stimulants.   

But now, IM PISSED OFF. I’m in second year of university and I decided recently for some reason that I’m going to start behaving like a functioning member of society. I’ve been getting a consistent amount of sleep every night, waking up at 7 am and going to the gym every morning, and going to all of my classes. AND YET despite all of this I get the same feeling when I am in lectures (even though I am interested and engaged in the content) where it just becomes a constant, painful battle of fighting against the gates of sleep opening. It happened again twice this week and now I feel like I can’t brush it off anymore. The nature of these “sleepy attacks” is so bizarre and mentally painful. It feels like I’m about to go into a dream state but I’m fully conscious of what’s happening to me and I have to try and move all my limbs to try and keep my body awake. I’m really frustrated because I feel as though this should not be happening. I thought maybe it was a caffeine crash because I do like to drink a cup of coffee sometimes, but as I’m writing this I’ve just woken up from 30 minute nap I HAD to take after not having coffee this morning. 

I just want to go to my classes without having to worry about this. I feel like there is something wrong with my brain. For those of you with type 2 narcolepsy, does this sound familiar to you at all? I’m not so sure about my rem cycle and that type of shit because I don’t track it but I do have extremely vivid dreams every night. 

I’m going to the doctor to talk to her about this on Monday but I’m not sure if I’m wasting both of our time and just being a sleepy teenager.

His training team consists of all women and he is the only male. The first 3 weeks he left, he was in a rural area, kept great communication. Calls & text throughout the day. His day consisted of training all day going out to dinner with him team & coming back to his hotel and facetiming me for hours. This current work trip he is in a more up beat kind of area. The training seems to be lighter on this trip. He would train for a few hours and then would have the rest of the day to explore the city. Here’s where I am having an issue.
- he’s hardly texting me, promised to call back and keeps me waiting for hours to call.
- I have his location and he is always at some activity, restaurant or bar.
- I have his ipad so i can see his text’s and would individually message the girls in his training group to go have dinner or grab coffee.
- Saw another text asking if this one girl changed her flight. 
I obviously do not expect him to be in a hotel room the entire time but it does make me uncomfortable him going to bars with 1 individual girl in his group vs. doing a group outing. & the fact that he is so busy doing things with his all girl training team to call me or ask about our children. I called him and he answered all out of breath saying he was hiking with the girls and didn’t want them to hear our convo.

I am very upset and told him how i felt. His response was that “its not his fault his training team is all girls” and did I expect him to sit in solitude? He later texted me again he finds this situation unserious. I have blocked him from my phone for the last 2 days. I am postpartum and upset and can’t focus on my priority here (our kids) while dealing with him. He comes home today and I honestly don’t want to be here when he comes home. We have been together 10+ and he has never given me a reason to believe he is unfaithful. AIO?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Today I woke up again with that pain, it's 2:20PM, and I still have it, but it's not because I'm craving cigarettes, but because yesterday I jugged like 3 coffee cups at the office, which is unusual for me, woke up at 5 yesterday and slept at 2am. Am I self-destructing? Maybe, but am I craving cigarettes? Absolutely not. 

But now sometimes I focus on how free and how smooth it is to draw a breath, how I don't feel a tightness in my chest, and how the air and my lungs feel clean, how I don't hyperventilate like crazy just going up the stairs...etc, and I just remember how addicted I was while smoking. 

True, today sucks because of yesterday, I probably need to take a very long ass nap to compensate, but this is nothing like when I was smoking. The constant daily dizziness from smoking, craving the next hit, going through 1 minute of feeling high then back to the same miserable existence, it's a feeling I'm way too familiar with it, and I just feel sad for my past self, I genuinely feel this type of sadness about what I used to do to my body, and I still can't believe that I was that deep in it and that I broke free from it.

by c.w. cobblestone

I cleaned up after dinner Thursday and did the dishes before limping to the laundry room, where I ironed the outfits that the family had picked out for the next day. Once everything was neatly pressed, I put the clothes on hangers and carried them upstairs.

Liz and Cody were watching TV in the living room, so I let myself into their bedroom — it still killed me to think of it as “their bedroom” — and hung their outfits in the closet.

Next, I knocked on Brooke’s door. She was sitting at her desk doing homework and waved me in.

As I hung up her clothes, Brooke crinkled her nose. “You know what? I don’t wanna wear that tomorrow — go iron my yellow striped outfit, and make sure my yellow pumps are shined and ready to go.”

“Yes, Miss,” I said with a curtsey, hiding my annoyance that I’d just wasted a half-hour ironing her difficult taffeta blouse and silk skirt, only to have the little princess change her mind.

“And do it quick, maid,” Brooke snapped. “You move too damned slow. Act like you want to do this job — I’m sick of you moping around.”

“Y-yes, Miss.”

After Brooke summarily dismissed me by saying, “Okay, maid, you can go,” I delivered Mia’s outfit to her room.

As I hung the blouse and slacks in the younger sister’s closet, she jeered.

“So, loser, you ready for your punishment tomorrow night?”

“Um, I … I don’t know, Miss. I guess so.”

“You guess so?”

“Uh, I … I’m ready, Miss.”

“Pfft. It must suck being a maid, huh?”

I didn’t respond.

Mia pressed me: “Seriously, don’t it suck having to be everyone’s little bitch all the time?”

“I … I … I just want to be a good maid, Miss.”

My precocious boss wasn’t about to let me off that easy.

“But don’t it suck knowing you’re gonna get punished tomorrow night, and for a bunch of weeks after that, no matter what you do?”

“Um, kind of, Miss — but I know it’ll help me become a better maid, so I know it’s good for me.”

“Which punishment you gonna pick tomorrow?”

“I … um, if your dad lets me choose, I’ll probably go with writing the lines, Miss. And, uh, being in the corner.”

“You mean STANDING in the corner?!!” Mia scoffed. “Don’t it suck having to write out a bunch of lines and stand in the corner like a little seven-year-old?”

“I … please, Miss, I just want to be a good maid.”

“Yeah, right. Like Brooke said, you’re a loser. Now, get the hell out of my room before I have my dad give you another ten check marks.”

I curtseyed, scurried away as fast as my heels and sore lower extremities allowed, and took Aunt Sheila’s outfit to her room — yet another space that had been mine until someone more important displaced me. As I was hanging her clothes in the closet, the autocratic old woman strode in and closed the door behind her.

“Your master told me I could use you any way I want, sissy,” she said as she started unbuttoning her blouse. “Now, go back in that closet and get the black leather duffel bag, and put it on the bed.”

Following a perfect curtsey, I retrieved the satchel and set it on the mattress. Aunt Sheila told me to open it, and when I slid the zipper and peeled back the flap, I flinched upon seeing an array of wicked-looking S&M devices inside.

“Ready for some fun, sissy?” Aunt Shelia asked with lust clouding her eyes as she removed her blouse. She then unhooked her bra and stepped out of her slacks and panties. The woman was obese, with huge boobs that sagged nearly to her belly button, and I found nothing attractive about her whatsoever.

She reached in the bag and pulled out a huge strap-on dildo that made my eyes bulge out.

“You ever been fucked in the ass, sissy?”

“Yes, Ma’am.”

“By who? My nephew?”

“I … Ma’am, please, I mean no disrespect but I’d rather not say.”

“That’s what your answer had BETTER be, sissy — don’t you EVER talk about your betters’ private lives behind their backs. Especially MY private life.”

“Yes, Ma’am.”

“Do you know what turns me on, Mirabella?”

“Um, no, Ma’am.” I didn’t want to know.

“Seeing little sissies scared like you are right now, with that deer-in-the-headlights look, wondering what’s going to happen to you,” she replied with an evil grin. “It’s such a power rush!”

She retrieved a vial from the bag, unscrewed the top and, with the attached medicine dropper, coated the dildo with brown liquid. I was dying to know what the substance was, but I knew better than to ask.

“Take off your dress, maid.”

I hastily obeyed, feeling self-conscious standing in front of the critical old spinster wearing nothing but my cock cage.

She sneered. “Aren’t you a pathetic specimen? A skinny little runt. Now, come on — bend over and spread your cheeks.”

Immediately after I complied, I felt a sharp pain in my rectum as the old woman shoved in the dildo and started pumping.

Within seconds, though, a feeling of tranquility washed over me, and my senses became overloaded with euphoric images, beautiful music and love, love, love.

“What are you feeling right now, Mirabella?”

“Just … colors.” My head was swimming.

“This dildo is coated with Ayahuasca,” Aunt Sheila explained as she rammed into me again and again. “It’s a South American psychedelic that’ll help you accept being the sissy maid you are.”

As I was being pegged, I completely lost control. I wasn’t unconscious, but I was stuck inside a kaleidoscope. Through the psychedelic haze, I felt the dildo sliding out of me, and the universe seemed perfectly aligned. I knew at that moment that I was born to serve because I was in a lower caste. My submissive fantasies, which I’d had since childhood, were there for a reason. It’s who I was.

After what felt like ten thousand years of being pegged into submission, Aunt Sheila grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to the bed. She got comfortable on the pillows and spread her legs, exposing her flabby pussy.

“Get your sissy little nose down here and start licking.”

Stoned out of my mind, I drifted toward the old woman’s vagina, possessed by one thought: I must please her at all costs. The very universe depended on it.

I started licking with a fervor, which caused Aunt Sheila to cuff me on the ear.

“Slow down, sissy, you don’t have a damn train to catch. I want to make this last.”

Last, it did; I must’ve spent three hours between Aunt Sheila’s legs. She farted in my face several times and laughed about it. Then, she took a nap while I just kept on dutifully licking. Finally, when my neck and jaws felt like they were about to fall off, she had a long orgasm, yanking my hair back and forth with each spasm.

When she was satisfied, she shoved me off the bed with her foot, just like her nephew was prone to do, and I tumbled onto the floor.

“I’m done with you, for now,” she said. “Now, check and make sure everyone’s in bed, and then go ahead and start your curtsey practice. Just because I’m feeling generous, we’re going to do five hours tonight instead of four. What do you say?”

“Um, t-thank you, Ma’am, for trying to make me a better maid,” I said.

The effects of the drug had started to wear off, although I still felt fuzzy as I limped into the hallway, my face wet with Aunt Sheila’s juices, and my ass on fire. The lights were out in the bedrooms, so with a weary sigh, I hobbled to the basement to start my nightly curtsey practice, with an extra hour tacked on just because.

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

I felt miserable from head to toe when I woke up Friday morning. I had a hangover from the drug Aunt Sheila had administered to me anally the night before. Over the past few days, I’d gotten only a few hours of sleep. My poor feet had blisters all over from those infernal heels. My calves throbbed. I had developed a rash on and around my penis from the chafing caused by the chastity cage. And sleeping on the hard basement floor was absolutely destroying my back.

My emotions weren’t exactly in great shape either. I knew I was going to be punished later that day no matter what, and had already decided I would write lines and do corner time rather than endure a starvation diet, if given another opportunity to choose my poison.

After my freezing cold shower, I got dressed and hobbled upstairs to start the coffee. While the pot brewed, I did a walk-through of the downstairs, ensuring everything was ship-shape.

When it was time to bring coffee to my mistress and master, I had to draw a few deep breaths to calm myself before venturing to their room. Seeing my beloved Liz cuddling with the only man she’d ever loved first thing in the morning really had a demoralizing effect, like a slap in the face to start the day.

I prayed my master would let me just serve the coffee and move on, but those hopes were shattered when I set his cup on his nightstand, and he smirked and asked, “Are you thirsty Mirabella?”

The only permitted answer was yes, and Cody responded by ordering me to kneel in the bathroom. I waited there for a good twenty minutes before my master got up and strolled toward me. This time, Liz didn’t bother to follow, and I assumed she was getting bored watching me serve as her boyfriend’s urinal.

Wordlessly, my master whipped out his dick, stuck it down my throat and let loose with a pungent stream of morning pee. I managed to swallow most of it, but a trickle escaped from the corner of my lip and ran down my apron. That earned me a bitch-slap and three check marks, bringing the total to twenty-four.

That meant I was on the hook for six months of punishment unless I could figure out a way to get a few demerits erased — and with Brooke no longer on my side, the prospect of that happening didn’t look so good.

During breakfast, Aunt Sheila made a suggestion that caused my heart to stop.

“You know, now that Mirabella doesn’t have to hide, you should really look into having surgery done,” the family matriarch said after taking a sip of orange juice.

“Yeah, I thought about that,” Cody replied glancing at me. “For sure, breast implants.”

“Oh, he’ll need a lot more than that if he’s going to truly become a proper maid,” Aunt Sheila said. “I’m thinking we should get his nose thinned out, and we can Botox those lips, too. I have a friend, a plastic surgeon, who’ll do it for cheap. He owes me a few favors.”

“Get him butt implants like Kim Kardashian,” Brooke chimed in.

“Yeah, his rear end is pretty bony,” Aunt Sheila answered with a laugh. “I’ll see if Dr. Zachary can fatten those cheeks up a little, too.”

“That might get a little expensive,” Liz said. “I make good money at the firm, but we’ve still got to put these two in college, and I—”

Aunt Sheila sat up in her chair. “I’ll tell you what: I’ll take care of it. Consider it a gift.”

“Oh, come on, Aunt Sheila.” Liz waved her hand. “We can’t accept that.”

“Sure, you can. Dr. Zachary owes me a few favors; he’ll do it for a fair price,” the old woman said with a smile. “And I’ve got plenty of money saved up. Please let me do this for you.”

Liz shrugged. “Sure. Wow, I don’t know what to say. Thank you so much.”

Having to stand there listening to the family discuss my future like that, as if I had no say whatsoever in the reshaping of my body, was extremely mortifying and terrifying. Making matters worse, I kept thinking about how my master had told me he might have me castrated to “fatten me up” after he first saw me naked, and I wondered if that procedure might also get tacked on when the girls weren’t around to hear.

After the conversation about my possible surgeries, it was decided that there was no longer a reason for me to wash off my makeup and change clothes each time I drove the girls to school.

“Does that mean I can tell my friends I have a trans maid?” Brooke asked her mom.

Liz shrugged. “I don’t see why not.”

“It’s a wonder Jenna Tomzak hasn’t blabbed it everywhere already,” Mia said.

“Well, if you’d have kept your mouth shut, that wouldn’t have been a problem, now, would it?” Liz frowned at her youngest daughter.

Brooke sniffed. “Screw Jenna Tomzak. Her mom beat the crap out of her at the stable, so she probably didn’t say anything — and who cares, anyway? Now that we don’t have to hide, we can tell everyone about Mirabella, and they’ll all think we’re cool.”

I felt a wave of pride that Brooke might want to brag about me to her friends — but that was quickly replaced by humiliation and apprehension when I realized my private business would become public.

The girls piled in the back of the minivan and, for the first time, I got behind the wheel still dressed in drag. I felt incredibly vulnerable on the ride to Central High School, and was afraid other motorists might look at me and see that I wasn’t a woman. I was also scared Brooke or Mia might spot one of their friends when I dropped them off at school and want to introduce me to them. Luckily, though, nobody was nearby when I pulled to the curb, and they exited the minivan and walked into the main entrance, allowing me to escape with my dignity intact.

That didn’t last long. As soon as I got home, Cody called me:

“Sissy! Get up here!”

I glanced around and didn’t see Aunt Sheila, and when I hurried up the stairs, I noticed that her room was empty. When I knocked on the open master bedroom door and saw Cody lying naked in bed playing with his big dick, I was overcome with sadness and excitement at the same time.

He smirked. “It’s been a few days, sissy; did you miss me?”

“Um, yes, Master.”

“Aunt Sheila’s gone shopping, so we have some time alone. Go pick out something sexy to wear for Daddy — and don’t forget to wear your bells.”

“Y-yes, Master,” I whispered.

With a snappy curtsey, I exited the bedroom and plodded to the basement to prepare myself for my master. I was scared to death as usual — and, as usual, I felt a stirring inside my cage.

I looked at myself in the mirror. What a ridiculous figure I cut in my pink polka-dotted camisole with the words “QUEER BAIT” etched across the front. The bells on my collar tinkled with each slight movement. My eyes were sunken from lack of sleep. My complexion was wan.

“Brooke was right,” I muttered to my reflection. “You really ARE a loser. A sad, pathetic loser. And a fag, too.”

With that cheery thought, I slogged back upstairs to face the music.",4,1741958735.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

And then noticed that when I spend about an hour in the sun for vitamin D, say, reading in a park during the midday, the next morning my anxiety is even worse, I even feel some agitation and melancholia when I'm in the sun. I read that sunlight exposure increases cortisol, so is this (early) morning anxiety due to sun exposure?

I have some female friends but I get along with my wife’s cousin(married) a lot. She is the same age as me and we got along from the start even before she got married. For the past 10 years(how long I’ve known my wife) I think we have either texted at least once a month or 2. She did most of the initiating like asking how I am, vacation plans, asking me for dating advice, school advice, she asked me out for coffee a few times, and she is a bit nosy so she likes to ask me how me and wifes sex(for conceiving) is going. She used to study fertility a little and we are having trouble conceiving so she offered to give me advice. She asks me how my ‘tests’ went and stuff. At first I didn’t want to talk about things like that with her but she really wanted to know. So I share her some of my stresses I had with my wife and I not being able to conceive and she gave me some advice on that like how I shouldnt be stressed during sex and just enjoy it without thinking of ‘baby’. Sometimes she tries to be nice and relate to our situation and describes her period on how irregular it is(wife also has irregular) but she had a baby so clearly she didn’t go through trouble. I think she was a little too excited for us. Weirdly she texts me more than she does to my wife. Is this wrong as friends and texting once a month or 2 appropriate?

I really think it would be beneficial to have a bot reply with suggestions like calling your councilperson, links to Vision Zero project resources and who to call, local precinct captain contact, suggestions to ask for enforcement at public 'coffee with a cop', links to town council meetings with open session rules, ect. If such a thing existed, what would be the information or links to include?

No matter what I accomplished, it was never enough for her. I could be captain of the school team, but I wasn’t kind enough to my friends. I topped my class, but I needed to work harder. College, a PhD, a job, a house, nothing brought affection or approval from her. While I saw my friends being dotted on by their mothers as if they found the solution for world peace. 

It got worse over the years. I remember once, in front of everyone, she slapped me hard just because I said something that didn’t sit right with her. That moment stayed with me, it felt like all my worth was crushed in an instant. I used to joke, knocking on her chest saying I found the stone (in place of her heart) but she’d just push me away, never understanding that all I wanted was for her to see me, to love me, to even just hug me.

I’ve carried this pain into adulthood, self-hate, bitterness, and a bottomless pit that never seems to find it's fill of emotional vulnerability. Even now, when I see a woman being kind, like pouring coffee gently, my heart breaks, because it reminds me of everything I never had. It’s reflected in my relationships too, the need for safe space , the bdsm intensities, but nothing has ever been able to fill that space.

Does anyone else still long for a mother’s love, even as an adult? I sometimes wish I could find someone to replace her entirely, but I know it’s just a fantasy. How do you process this need for nurturing and care that you didn’t get? I’m really struggling with this.

The store by us is in a weirdly shaped shopping center and I've noticed the employees routinely prefer to keep cars at the order screen 5-10 minutes (sometimes as bad as 10-15 minutes) at the order kiosk instead of simply letting you drive up or wait for window.


Cars are therefore blocks into the street waiting even though Starbucks has about 800 ft of space from the order kiosk to the window itself. It loops around building for reference. 


Today the wait time was horrendous and despite ordering 15 min before they told me to get out of drive thru line and go back to end of drive thru line where I'd likely wait another 25 minutes to get to kiosk. I asked employee how they'd manage my order I ordered at the window for comparison.... Shocked Pikachu face and silence.

Regardless after our chat I still sent a follow up and thanked him even though I knew things ended up not going well but I am now desperately trying to find something I can do as a last ditch effort to get an internship for this summer.

* $1,251. I try to keep a buffer of $1000 month-to-month and between paychecks once all my deductions go out. 

**Credit card debt (and how you accumulated it):** 

* $0 (pay it off in full every month)

**Student loan debt (for what degree):** 

* I currently have $15k left to pay, down from a beginning balance of $50k. $5,500 was from an undergrad loan my parents asked me to take out to help cover my first year of college. I had a full-tuition scholarship for undergrad and my parents graciously covered the majority of my living expenses. The remaining balance was from my master’s degree. I received a partial scholarship for my master’s and covered the rest of tuition with loans, but paid my living expenses from various jobs and savings. I chipped away at my loans during my PhD, and am planning to aggressively pay down my highest interest rate loan by November this year. The undergrad loan has such a low interest rate, and a small enough balance, that I will probably pay it off more slowly. I hope to be student loan debt free before my 31st birthday! 

**Section Two: Income**

**Income/job Progression:** 

I was in school from age 5 straight through to age 28, and only recently started earning a solid income. During undergrad I worked odd jobs on and off campus for grocery and fun money. I worked on-campus jobs during my master’s program. In my second year, I was a teaching assistant and made $16k, and I honestly felt rich! My PhD program in the social sciences–at a different school than my master’s–paid me fairly well. With my stipend, fellowship, and summer internships, I had a very livable wage for my area at around $60k per year. 

I am currently in my first job post-PhD making $89k as a social science researcher in the public sector. It’s more than I ever thought I would make in my first year (first 5 years, even) out of my PhD. I feel incredibly lucky to have this salary and amazing benefits, and I really don’t take it for granted. In some ways I feel like I’m in golden handcuffs, because the pay, benefits, and flexibility are fantastic, but I don’t \*love\* the work and the career growth opportunities are not fantastic at my organization. I will get annual COL raises, but I won’t be eligible for a promotion for at least 5 years. There is also no paid parental leave, which makes me sad even though I don’t even know if I will ever have a baby. For now, it’s a great opportunity and I’m trying to stay as long as possible (assuming our team doesn’t lose funding under this administration…).

Generally, I worry that I am behind my peers who have been working since day 1 after undergrad. But I have to commend myself for the small steps I have taken over the years, like contributing to a Roth IRA in grad school, chipping away at my student loans, and building an emergency fund. Sometimes I wonder if it was a mistake to do a PhD, but I know my degree will open doors in the research space that would not be open had I tapped out at a master’s. 

  
**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

$4460 per month (in a 2 paycheck month) after all deductions:

Deductions per paycheck:

* $222.50 to my state retirement plan
* $50 to my 457(b)
* $724 in state, federal, and FICA taxes
* $59 for health insurance
* $31 to my union
* $102.50 to a state retirement health fund 

**Side Gig Monthly Take Home**

I very occasionally babysit and sell clothes on Poshmark. Under $500 per year total. 

**Any Other Monthly Income Here**

My parents pay for my phone bill. I withdraw money from my savings several times a year for pre-saved travel and car expenses.

**Section Three: Expenses**

Rent: $625 per month for my share of the rent, which I split equally with my girlfriend, B (so $1250 total). We have a gorgeous 2 bedroom unit in a multi-family home. We live in a MCOL pocket of a generally HCOL state. We are so lucky to have this unit at this rate and are going to try to stay here a long as possible, but are also trying to buy a house in a couple of years. Trade-offs!

Renters / home insurance: $200 a year, split in half with B.

Retirement contribution: In addition to the retirement contributions from my paycheck, I also max out my Roth IRA every year. This year I contributed $1500 in January, and now I’m contributing $500 a month for the rest of the year.

Savings contribution: Varies, but I usually move \~$1000 +/- $100 into my HYSA every month based on what other expenses I have. I plan to double my monthly contribution once my higher interest student loan is paid off. B and I are working towards a home downpayment!

Debt payments (please break this down individually and specify if you're paying above the minimum): My loans kick into repayment next month. My required monthly payment will be $197, but I am going to pay $1000 a month until my highest interest loan is paid off later this year. 

Donations: $0. At my income, I know I should be donating to causes I care about (especially in this political climate.). I can suffer from analysis paralysis (what are the best places to donate to? Mutual aid vs. non profits? etc.). I do volunteer my time with a local youth conference. 

Electric: Varies, usually $40 total split equally with B.

Gas: Varies, but our bill has been over $250 a month this winter. Yikes. Split in half with B.

Wifi/Cable/Landline: We share our Wifi with our downstairs neighbor, who is our good friend! $60 split 3 ways.

Laundromat: $20

Cellphone: $0, my parents still pay.

Subscriptions: $13 a month for Spotify; $8 every 3 months for a new electric toothbrush head. $8 a month for my favorite Substack/podcast. We use our families’ logins for streaming. 

Gym membership: $13 a month for the Peloton app, $10 a month for my local rec center, and $127 every few months for a 10 class pass to a local fitness studio.

Food and household items: $250 a month on groceries/household items (around $500 total, B and I split pretty 50/50). I spend maybe $100 a month on dining out.

Car: $1,132 a year for car insurance, paid upfront. Typically under $45 a month on gas. 

Pet: $44 a month for pet insurance, for my dog who currently lives with my parents in another state. It’s kind of a bittersweet situation, but she is SO happy with them and they (and their dogs!) love her to pieces. 

Paid hobbies: I spend $20 every few months on embroidery supplies. I make sourdough bread a couple times a week (I consider it a hobby because I genuinely LOVE to do it!), and so we spend $8 on good bread flour every few weeks. 

“Fun”/Misc. expenses, like clothing, home decor, concerts, gifts for B and family, travel, etc.: I try to keep this to under $5,000 a year and it obviously varies from month to month. Big travel expenses come out of my travel sinking fund.   


My girlfriend, B, makes around $75k per year. We split things 50/50 the majority of the time, but we will individually cover dinners, ice creams/coffees, smaller grocery runs, etc. from time to time without the expectation that the other repays. Even though I make more, this split feels appropriate for us because B has fewer paycheck deductions, and she also wants me to have the wiggle room to pay down my loans aggressively. I am very grateful! I have slightly higher earning potential, so we will re-negotiate our split of things in the future as our careers progress. We also plan to open a joint credit card and checking account soon. I look forward to the day when we aren’t constantly Venmoing back and forth, but for now it works for us and doesn’t feel too burdensome.

  
**Money Diary**

Day 1

5:45 It’s Friday! Woo! B leaves for work by 6:30 and I try my very hardest to wake up with her most mornings. Usually I fail, and B ends up waking me up on her way out the door. She loves being my alarm clock, and I love the extra 45 minutes of sleep. Win win! I have a chill morning and work on my current embroidery project, a year-long embroidery journal where I stitch a unique icon every day! I’ve been searching for a pair of white/off-white Everlane jeans on Poshmark, and two separate sellers offer me amazing deals on a pair of wide leg pants and a pair of cropped straight leg jeans (NWT!). I snag both (**$63.75**).

8:30 My job is 100% remote and pretty flexible and I usually work 8:30-4:30. I start my workday with some emails. 

12:30 I take my 1 hour lunch break and cook up a veggie patty served over a bed of arugula with a drizzle of oil, lemon juice, and some shaved parm. Yum! I am on the hunt for some new Birkenstocks, so I spend my lunch hour browsing the web. 

4:30 I’m off for the weekend! B and I head to Costco for a little stock up. We head to the gas area first and B pumps it because I am a passenger princess even in my own car (**$17.87**). We don’t usually buy fresh produce at Costco because we can’t eat it all before it goes bad, so our cart ends up being an assortment of random items: pecans, peanut butter, maple syrup, King Arthur bread flour ($8 for 10lbs, the BEST deal!), chicken stock, deodorant, and shampoo and conditioner. Every Costco trip we treat ourselves to a “fun” food; this time around it’s a 5lb bag of chicken nuggets. Heck yes! It takes every fiber of our being not to buy a giant bag of Cadbury mini eggs. **$98/$49 for my share at Costco**

6:30 We get home from Costco, put away our goodies, and head out for a double date night with our friends at our favorite pizza spot. They’re about to leave for a vacation in Central America and we are so jealous. I put the bill on my new CC to build up toward my welcome bonus spend requirement (**$27.50 for my share).**

  
9:00 I had one too many beers at dinner (as in, 1 beer), and the spirit calls me to the local dive bar for a night cap with our friends. We all order vodka sodas with lime and our friends pay. I’m feeling a little silly and life is good! It’s the weekend!

10:30 B and I walk home and are very tempted to make tipsy chicken nuggets. We are sensible and eat clementines instead! After getting read for bed, we manage to do our nightly routine of Wordle, Connections, and Strands before we fall asleep! 

**Embroidery icon**: A lime wedge for my vodka soda! 

**Day 1 total:** $158.12

Day 2

6:30 I wake up way too early for a Saturday, but I never usually sleep well after drinking (seriously, one drink is enough to affect my sleep. Ugh.). I make an Americano and work on some embroidery while listening to Gabby Windey’s podcast. I learned about her through this season of the Traitors and find her to be quite funny. She’s a bit of a departure from my typical personal finance/news/society type podcasts, but it’s nice to listen to something more fluffy!

9:30 B and I make a grocery list and head to the store. We usually try to get at least one of our weekend chores done first thing Saturday morning! This week we are planning to make ramen to last us a couple of nights, and we have enough at home already to get creative for dinners the rest of the week. We also stock up on our other daily essentials like milk, yogurts, fruit, etc. **$54 total/$27 for my share**

10:30 Our friends (the same ones from last night!) come over for lattes so we can see them again before they head off on their big adventure! We got an espresso maker as a joint Christmas/birthday gift from my parents, and have loved being able to treat our friends to homemade lattes. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about the science of espresso and milk steaming!

11:30 We head to B’s parents’ house to do our laundry and catch up. Unfortunately our building doesn’t have in-unit laundry, and we are lucky that B’s family members always let us bring our laundry over! B’s mom feeds us lunch and we go for a big walk around the neighborhood. She gives us a dozen eggs from her chickens!!

4:30 We’re home! We make a batch of our favorite granola for the week ahead, then settle in to watch the Traitors finale! We have a giant bag of potatoes to use up, so dinner is mashed potato, chicken nuggets, and an arugula, carrot, and cucumber salad. We realize this is our first time eating chicken nuggets together… there’s a first time for everything! 

9:30 We head to bed early since neither of us slept very well the night before. Wordle, Connections, Strands, of course! 

**Embroidery icon**: A gold puck for the Traitors finale! 

**Day 2 total**: $27

Day 3

8:00 I wake up later than normal due to the time change. I get up and start working on a book chapter that I started working on during an internship over 5 years ago. The team I worked with is turning their research into a book, and they asked me to include my work as a chapter. I’m flattered, but it’s tough finding the time and motivation to work on it around my day job!

11:00 B is visiting her grandma and I’m still writing. I finish up, and then do an at-home Peloton strength workout. I have the spring cleaning bug so I pull out a ton of old clothes and shoes to prepare to sell them on Poshmark. My Poshmark usage (as a seller and a buyer) ebbs and flows, but I feel motivated to get some items sold this season!

3:00 I am off to my first ceramics class! It was a birthday gift from B. I took a hand building class years ago and loved it, and this time I am trying wheel throwing. As a recovering perfectionist and someone who gets discouraged and wants to run away when I’m not good at something right away, this first class was so, so tough for me mentally! But I managed to throw a cylinder and am really excited for class next week! I pay for my clay at the studio (**$25**).

6:00 We make salmon for dinner and eat up the leftover salad, mashed potato, and some broccoli we need to use up! We catch up on Love Is Blind (these men….).

9:30 I start a new book before bed (I Who Have Never Known Men). Wordle, Connections, Strands and then sleep! 

**Embroidery icon**: A pottery wheel for my first ceramics class!

**Day 3 total:** $25

Day 4

5:45 B’s alarm goes off. I was going to go to the gym first thing this morning, but I slept horribly and decide to sleep in until 7. I have a very slow morning before I sit down at my desk to work with a bowl of yogurt and fruit for breakfast. 

12:00 I sign off for my lunch break. It’s a chill work day! The past few weeks have been absolutely hectic as we gear up for a data collection effort, so I am grateful for a quieter day and hopefully week. I have a quick piece of toast, a handful of pretzels, and a clementine for lunch before I head off on a big walk because it’s a glorious 60 degrees out today! 

1:30: One of my two Poshmark pants arrive! They are so cute, in great condition, and were SUCH a steal. I can’t wait to wear them all spring and summer. 

4:30 It’s so nice out that I crack open a few windows to air out the apartment after the long winter. I wrap up my work day and head outside to clean may car. I promised myself that on the first warm, sunny day I would vacuum and wipe down my car’s interior, so here I am….

6:00 B and I make our ramen for dinner. It’s one of our favorite recipes and it’s been a while since we made it! The broth has miso and turmeric, and we love to load it up with tons of veggies - today it’s carrot, bok choy, and broccoli! We love a TV dinner (if you can’t tell already) and continue to make our way through Love is Blind. 

9:30 Off to bed! I make the mistake of viewing LinkedIn before bed and see that a ton of the non-profits in my field have had to lay off staff due to federal research funding cuts. It’s so demoralizing. Wordle, Connections, and Strands and lights out!

**Embroidery icon:** An open window for the first warm day of the year!

**Day 4 total**: $0

Day 5

5:45 I slept way better last night and make it to the gym by 6:15. The “gym” is our local community center that I pay $10 a month for to access a small (but well-stocked!) fitness center and a pool, where I occasionally take water aerobics classes with a bunch of older women. Honestly, a great deal. I walk for 20 minutes and then do a Peloton arm workout. 

8:30 Home and showered, I sit down at my desk with some peanut butter toast and coffee. It’s another slow-ish work day with only a couple of meetings.

1:00 I use my lunch break to prep some more items to sell on Poshmark. Now that it’s warming up I make a big blueberry banana smoothie for lunch.

4:30 I head off for a walk to enjoy the 60 degree day! 

5:30 Home from my walk, I remember I have an in-person meeting for a youth conference I am volunteering with. The conference is coming up really soon and it’s crunch time. I get read to leave for the meeting and realize I won’t be able to eat dinner until very late, so I have a small bowl of mashed potatoes to hold me over until later. I swing by the library on my way to the meeting to pick up The Privatization of Everything (thanks to the Money with Katie Show for the rec!) 

8:00 Meeting over! I text B to ask if she can make me an egg on avocado toast and some side salad for when I get home. The egg is SO delicious with a perfectly jammy yolk. 

9:00 I notice I have the start of a stye on my water line, and my eyelid eczema is also flaring up. Fun! I FaceTime my friend whose husband is an ophthalmologist, and she passes the phone to him to inspect my eye. He gives me some advice to treat the stye and mentions that stress and inflammation probably caused the stye-eczema double whammy. I don’t feel particularly stressed lately, but then I remember B and I had some (now resolved) conflict over the weekend and that probably led to the flare up. I do a warm compress before we hop into bed and W, C, S! We always start Wordle with the same word, and tonight I guess our second word. It’s green all across, baby! Whenever this happens, B always jokingly asks me if I’ve cheated by playing Wordle on my own earlier in the day. But I promise I never do!!!

**Embroidery icon:** An eye to commemorate my stye. Lovely. 

**Day 5 total:** **$0** 

  
Day 6

6:15 B wakes me up from my not-so-peaceful slumber. The upstairs neighbor has a heavy foot and she was stomping around at all hours of the night. I also had some wild dreams. In one, I was in high school and had a baby?! But everyone was so nice to me and left kind notes in my locker to congratulate me.

6:30 I’m settled into my favorite reading chair. B brings me a cup of coffee and I read for a little while. I get a scary message from my mom, who is currently overseas visiting family and friends, that she is having some concerning health issues and is cancelling some of her plans. I give her a ring and we chat for a bit. She’s totally fine, but it’s scary nonetheless. I hate that my parents are getting older and live halfway across the country.

8:30 I get my workday started. First up is some budget management. B Venmo requests me for my share of this month’s gas and electricity (**$130 for my share**). 

12:00 Lunch time! I make another blueberry banana smoothie and feed my sourdough starter to make a double batch of dough tonight. I’ve been browsing for a standing desk for months and haven’t bit the bullet (in part because I didn’t want to spend the money, in part because I wasn’t sure I would use the stand up feature). However, it’s my lucky day because I find the exact desk I’ve been looking at but it’s new-in-box on FB Marketplace! I take it as a sign to try it out, and even if I don’t use the stand up function much, it’s generally an upgrade from my current desk. 

4:30 Because it’s a lighter week, I use the last hour of my work day to finish up the last few formatting things for the book chapter I’m working on and finally send it off to the lead author! Phew, that’s a weight off my shoulder, for now. I wrap up work a little early to go pick up the desk. (**$125**) On the way there and back I listen to LADY GAGA on this week’s Las Culturistas and I feel like I’m parasocially beaming with pride the whole time for Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang <3 <3 <3 

6:00 I’m home! I was going to do a pilates workout tonight but my eye is really bothering me so I decide to chill. B has a work event tonight so I heat up the last of our ramen for dinner and read while eating.

8:00: B’s home! I completely forgot to mix up my dough, so I do that quickly. We carry my new desk up the stairs and it’s a bit of a doozy. B gets to go into work late tomorrow, so we stay up and assemble the desk while watching the LIB weddings. I’m so happy with how the desk turned out! Now to sell my old one…

11:00: It’s a VERY late school/work night for us! Oops. We get ready for bed and only get to Wordle and Connections before it’s time to crash.

**Embroidery icon:** A desk for my new standing desk! 

**Day 6 total:** $255

  
Day 7

7:30 We slept in this morning thanks to our late night and B getting to go into work late today! I make B a latte and check on my dough. It still needs a few more hours for its bulk ferment. I love making sourdough bread because it’s both a science and an art. The proofing process changes throughout the year as the temperature and humidity fluctuates, and with every new season I have to make little tweaks to my process. 

8:30 I start my work day by standing at my new desk! I’m loving it. I work on some policy-related tasks for the morning. 

3:00 The work day has zoomed by and I haven’t taken a lunch break yet! I make a veggie patty and put it on top of some avocado toast. My second pair of Poshmark pants arrived and they truly just what I’ve been looking for in terms of color and style, but the waist is huge! This is a perpetual problem with Everlane. I have 4 pairs of pants/jeans from them in the same size and they all fit slightly differently at the waist. Ugh. I’m going to give them to B if they fit her, and if not I’ll try to resell them. 

4:45 It’s time to head out to my fitness class! I found this little studio back in the fall and have really enjoyed the classes. The strength classes are not that much different than what I can find on the Peloton app, but it’s so nice to get out of the house and to be in a group fitness setting around women of all different ages. I try to go once or twice a week. Plus, the Thursday instructor plays the BEST indie rock/alt playlists. Today’s class is HARD and I know I’m going to feel it for a few days! Once I pay off my higher interest student loan, I am going to pay for the monthly unlimited membership so I can come to more classes. 

6:30: I stop at the grocery store on my way home to buy some cookie supplies. My team is having an in-person work day tomorrow and we’re all bringing treats! We have vegan and gluten free team members so I grab supplies to make v/gf cookies. I already have some of the necessities at home. My store is doing a full rearrange and it is absolutely chaotic. There is camaraderie among the shoppers because we’re all so confused. There is one whole aisle of the store brand paper towel, and an aisle that has nothing but salad dressing. So bizarre! $**25.75**

7:00 When I get home, B is working a volunteer shift. I make us some dinner: arugula salad with chickpeas, carrots, and cucumber, and (still!) some leftover mashed potato. It’s all gone now, thankfully! We chat about our days while we eat. A regular topic of conversation for us lately has been about the possibility of marriage equality being overturned. We’ve been watching the news closely and with several states calling for SCOTUS to overturn its marriage equality ruling, we want to have a plan in place if a case ever makes its way to SCOTUS. While we live in a very affirming state that will always protect our right to get and stay married, for both symbolic and legal reasons we would want to get married while marriage equality is the law of the land.

8:00 I get to baking after dinner! The cookie recipe is made with coconut oil and coconut milk, and the dough is divine (I know you’re not supposed to eat raw dough even if it’s vegan, because of the flour, but I like to flout the rules sometimes lol). They come out of the oven flat as a pancake, sad! But they taste amazing and I’m hopeful my team will like them. 

10:00 B and I get ready for bed (another late one for us!) and Wordle and Connections.

**Embroidery icon**: An alarm clock with “7:30” on it, because we got to sleep in today! 

**Day 7 total**: $25.75

**Weekly total: $490.87**

* Food + Drink: $129.25
* Fun / Entertainment: $25
* Home + Health: $255
* Clothes + Beauty: $63.75
* Transport: $17.87

**Lastly, reflect on your diary!** 

This was a spendy week for me with the desk and clothing purchase. My food spending was also a little higher than in a typical week. I am working hard to become more financially flexible. For example, a past version of myself would have found it frivolous to have 3 different gym/workout expenses, but they all give me something a little different. I have worked hard to get to my current salary, and I feel good about my saving rate, so I want to enjoy my money to an extent! B and I have some fun trips planned this year, which aren’t reflected in this diary, but are another example of me/us using our money for fun. 

Money aside, I feel proud of the amount of time I spent out of the house this week. 100% WFH has been super hard for me emotionally, and it was especially challenging in the depths of the winter. Although I am a natural homebody, and genuinely love being cozy at home, getting out of the house more often has been great for my mental health. I am also quite prone to a grass is greener mentality, and can feel like my life is so boring compared to peers who live in big cities. Filling my life up with hobbies and activities out of the house has mitigated that feeling somewhat.

1jb3k7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/drivingsg/comments/1jb3k7h/avoid_this_private_instructor_at_all_cost/,Avoid this Private instructor at all cost.,"The driving instructor name is James Lim Thiam Eng, his car plate number is SMY. 4377-B and his phone number is 96196642. Usually waits at admiralty opposite MRT.

Avoid that old geezer at all cost. I was his student and had an extremely bad experience with him on the day of the examination. I did not have any proper preparation in the circuit before the TP as he made up some stupid story that there was another student taking exam before my slot hence not enough time to bring me go circuit.  Lo and behold, of course I failed my first TP. On normal learning days, not only were his instructions super unclear, he also liked to make use of the driving time to go coffee shop and drink for at least 20mins. 

Extremely agitated as I am typing this. Just want to raise awareness to everyone who wants to find a private instructor near SSDC here to avoid this guy at all cost. Do not let him leech and scam you.

FYI - **He has the lowest first timer passing rate at 16% among his peers at SSDC.** (I am so pissed at myself for not doing enough research to know that there's even public website showing the TP pass rate for each private instructor).

1jb3fza,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1jb3fza/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1jb3d4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jb3d4m/10_common_mistakes_new_entrepreneurs_make/,10 Common Mistakes New Entrepreneurs Make,"When diving into the whirlwind world of entrepreneurship, it's easy to get swept off your feet. I mean, who wouldn’t want to trade in their stuffy office cubicle for the thrill of running their own show? But before you say “yes” to the entrepreneurial dream, there are some common pitfalls lurking around that you’ll want to sidestep like a pro. So let’s unpack this with some humor and a touch of vulnerability.

1. **Underestimating the Importance of a Business Plan**: Picture this. You’re heading out on a road trip without a map. Exciting, right? Yeah, until you end up in a cornfield wondering how you got there. A solid business plan is your GPS—it charts your course, helps you stay focused, and prevents those detours that eat your time and money. Take the time to outline your goals, your target audience, and your financial projections. Trust me, this isn’t just busy work; it’s foundational.

2. **Ignoring the Power of Community**: Here’s a little secret: you don’t have to do it alone. It’s easy to think that you need to have all the answers, but guess what? You don’t! Surround yourself with mentors, fellow entrepreneurs, and even family. Whether it’s a coffee chat or a formal networking event, tap into the collective wisdom of your community. You’ll find more support than you ever thought possible. Don’t be shy—reach out! 

3. **Overextending Financially**: Ah, the allure of investing in all the shiny tools and gadgets that promise to elevate your business. I’ve been there, folks. But let’s not pretend we have unlimited resources! Resist the temptation to blow your budget all at once. Start small, focus on what you truly need, and gradually scale up. Lean on those funds as your business grows, not before it’s ready.

4. **Neglecting Self-Care**: Let’s get real for a moment. The grind can be exhilarating, but it can also be exhausting. Parks and rec are great, but you’ve got to carve out time for yourself, too. Set boundaries! Schedule those breaks, have a good laugh with friends, and don’t forget to sleep (seriously, trust me on this one). A well-rested mind is your most creative asset.

5. **Resisting Change**: The world of business is about as stable as a two-legged stool. What works today might not work in six months. Be open to feedback and willing to pivot when necessary. Just because you’ve poured your heart into one idea doesn’t mean it’s the only path you should follow. Often, God’s nudging you toward something even better.

The overarching theme here? Embrace transformation, lean into your community, and keep your spirit open to God’s plan for your business—and your life. You may stumble along the way, and that’s okay; just keep moving forward. After all, every misstep is a lesson wrapped in a story, waiting to be told. So take a deep breath and remember, you’ve got this!",1,1741957300.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

When we added solids she naturally tapered and she had basically self-weaned by this age. 

With my son, I actually feel like after we hit one year he INCREASED his feeding. I wasn't trying to wean him but I also wasn't expecting to nurse him more. He does eat solids but not as much as her. And I've tried everything. And I keep at it. And he eats way more solids than he used to but I feel like he relies on me much more than my first did. 

I'm trying to trust that this is normal and healthy but if I'm honest it's much harder than breastfeeding the first year. For instance every morning if he is with my husband they have breakfast after dropping my older child off at preschool. But for me, I can't feed myself or have coffee- I get cried and tantrummed at until I give him booba...for at least thirty minutes, sometimes an hour. Then he is happy. I don't mind breastfeeding him but I'm not sure how to feel about the demands of it. Breastfeeding way longer than he did the first year. 

And we do this a lot each day. More times than I can count. And all night long. First year he slept through the night and did not nurse much. Now it's constantly throughout the night sometimes. Not gonna lie I feel like my boobs are going through a lot. 

I don't mind breastfeeding him till 2 or 3 but I do mind that maybe it's effecting eating solids and that we do it so much at night. I have tried to night wean, not day wean, and it's a HOT mess. I can't deny booba at night without it descending into crying with desperate gasps. Has never taken a bottle. We had to supplement in the first year and I had to spoon feed it because after trying 13 different bottle brands I gave up. 

He isn't like this with my husband. If I'm not around, like when I am at nursing school he is totally fine. Eats solids and drinks out of a sippy cup. When I am around he needs me to breastfeed. 

I just want to hear if this is anyone else's experience. If I should be concerned about balance with solids. I don't need or want to wean him yet but I am concerned that at some point this won't be mutual and that it's going to be a war to wean. I would so much love some support and advice and words of encouragement. I love this baby so much, and I didn't want to wean him as early as my first did but I do have concerns about how this is going. Thanks! ",2,1741957153.0,breastfeeding,1,1.0,False

Once she had me (she told me once that if she ""believed"" in abortion she would have aborted me in an attempt to shame me out of one) she had to make my sister cuz siblings are important to her. We we're both very traumatic births, pre-mes, Batley alive ect. We were then raised by both lunatics who had no business being together, who inevitably got divorced. Guy placed out, refused to pay child support and I being the eldest daughter had to step in. We got ready for school on our own so my mother could sleep in, I lead us to school so she wouldn't have to get up and give us a ride, we walked back home from school cuz she was working 24/7 as a single mother. All at the ripe age of 9. When we got home we cleaned the entire house with a list of shit to do everyday. I cooked our meals and got us to bed to do it all over again the next day. This went on for abt 18 years. We're 19 and 20 now, still living with her. Still cleaning up after her messes, barely empty mugs, plates of half eaten food and take-out boxes, clutter, shoes socks ect. I can't even leave the house without acquiring a fucking side quest from her. ""OH can u pick up this"" EVERY SINGLE TIME I LEAVE THE HOUSE. She's talking abt moving out and leaving us here to pick up the lease and I WANT HER TO MOVE OUT ALREADY. She's the worst roommate ever! She leaves messes everywhere, there was a period of time she would have friends over and get drunk and loud keeping me up all night on a school night then treated ME like I was the asshole for being upset abt it, she hogs the bathroom for hours at a time in the morning to get ready, it's just. It's been my entire life like this, it was different when we we're kids cuz we had no choice. ""Yes mom, right away."" We were and still are expected to drop whatever it is we're doing and ""do her a favor"" God forbid we say no to her, we get a whole guilt trippy speech. God forbid we miss a single phone call, or don't get a text immediately. She'll spam us all freaked our and mad that we're ""ignoring"" her. Which we never have and literally never would do cuz we know how she is. When confronted she just throws a tantrum at the age of nearly 50yo. Idk, I can't live like this anymore. I'm so fucking tired of being my mothers servant. ""I say I'm proud of you all the time"" like that actually fixes anything. What triggered this rant is...I woke up this morning and my partner had spent all day making a pie which he left out (stupidly) and bunch of huge ass rats destroyed it during the night. So now, even tho I absolutely despise baking  I love them more) I'm gonna spend the day making them a new one. So the point is...I'm fucking busy. And my gd mother wakes up and orders me to make her a tea.(which she's not gonna drink, she makes coffee every single day, takes 2 sips of it and leaves it on the bathroom sink. 2,3 or 4 would even collect over time.) I finish up making my coffee (DON'T even get me started on the bs with sharing a coffee machine with her) and I pour some new water in and dump the coffee grounds. I even put a fucking mug there and walk away. ""You couldn't even press start? Jesus"" BRO YOU CANT EVEN PRESS A FUCKING BUTTON!!! And not even 60 seconds later She's asking my sibling. ""Can u scramble me some eggs, with this specific salt and this specific oil"" BRUHH. Now She's in the bathroom in ""such a hurry, gonna be late for work"" talking to some shithead boyfriend on the phone. I'm so fucking sick of being my mothers door at. I want her to move out, I want to move out but yk how the job and housing market is in the US these days its nearly impossible especially for a young person like me. I can't keep cleaning her messes, getting yelled at cuz I moved something to the wrong spot and watching get dirty all over again within like 2 minutes of her being back home. I can't live in her filth any more, I can't run her fucking errands anymore, pay her bills and walk on egg shells around her explosive emotions. It really is like living with a horrible roommate who could give less of a fuck. I'm so done. I never wanna live with her again. ",2,1741957132.0,Vent,1,0.75,False

Anxiety was also listed on the paperwork of course, but I went and looked at the ECG they took and that looked pretty concerning.

1jb37f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jb37f4/tried_laughland_teeth_whitening_for_a_week_heres/,Tried Laughland Teeth Whitening for a Week – Here’s What I Wish I Knew Before Starting,"I’ve always wanted whiter teeth but never wanted to pay hundreds for a professional whitening session. Over the years, I’ve tried whitening strips, special toothpastes, and even DIY baking soda tricks. Some worked a little, but the results were barely noticeable, and most left my teeth feeling sensitive.

When I heard about **Laughland teeth whitening**, I was intrigued. Unlike strips or toothpaste, it uses **a dentist-formulated gel combined with an LED mouthpiece** to activate the whitening process. The science made sense, so I decided to give it a shot.

Here’s what happened when I used it for six days straight.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When I opened the box, I appreciated how simple the kit was. No unnecessary extras, just what you need:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – Mess-free and easy to apply.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – Supposedly speeds up the whitening process.
* **Instructions** – Clear, simple steps without overcomplicating things.

I liked that it wasn’t overwhelming or messy like some whitening trays I’ve tried before.

# How It Works

The whole process takes just **10 minutes a day**, so it didn’t feel like a big commitment.

1. **Brush and Dry Teeth** – This helps the gel adhere better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – The pen makes it easy to coat each tooth evenly.
3. **Use the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn it on and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean** – Rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

I was relieved that the gel **didn’t have a harsh chemical taste**—just a mild, neutral flavor.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No immediate change, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** Noticed a difference—less yellowing, especially near the edges.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, looking noticeably brighter but still natural.

The best part? **No pain or sensitivity.** Every other whitening product I’ve used made my teeth sensitive to hot and cold, but I had zero discomfort with Laughland.

# Why Laughland Stood Out Compared to Other Whitening Methods

* **Whitening strips** left my teeth sensitive, and the results were uneven.
* **Whitening toothpaste** was good for maintenance but didn’t remove deeper stains.
* **Professional whitening** works well but is expensive and can leave teeth feeling sore.

Laughland felt like a **solid middle ground**—more effective than strips, but without the cost of professional treatments.

# Frequently Asked Questions About Laughland Teeth Whitening

**1. Does it damage enamel?** – No, the formula is designed to be gentle but effective.  
**2. Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, I noticed a significant improvement in coffee stains.  
**3. How long do results last?** – Avoiding staining foods helps maintain results for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

* **Use it daily** – Consistency makes a huge difference.
* **Avoid staining foods** – Coffee, tea, and wine can slow down results.
* **Brush & floss regularly** – Helps keep your teeth looking brighter for longer.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening worked better than any strips or toothpaste I’ve tried**. It was easy to use, painless, and actually delivered visible results without making my teeth sensitive.

Would it replace professional whitening? Probably not for extreme cases, but for an **affordable, at-home option that noticeably brightens teeth**, it’s worth considering.

I’ll definitely be using it again for maintenance, and I’m glad I didn’t waste more money on whitening strips.

1jb36p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoHeidiLita/comments/1jb36p6/march_14/,March 14,"8:45am, Lolita, after Track Team practice, showering, fixing my hair, and putting on makeup. I’m enjoying my NY Breakfast Sandwich and black coffee at the Lincoln Center fountain. As soon as I finish I will be heading to Maximo and Luisa’s photo shoot. Then I will work at the college library and take a dance class.

What a great surprise last night. The entire family met me at the ferry terminal and we walked home together. They had saved a plate for me. Then we all watched Episode 1, Season 2 of *A Discovery of Witches.* I had missed a couple of episodes so there are some gaps but I’m filling the holes.

I came home late because I had an evening meeting with Professor Green, my ESU mentor. He would like to entitle my course “Introduction to Ethnography.” He explained to me that there are two broad rivers of research: quantitative (primarily centered on numbers) and qualitative (with data coming from lived observations). Ethnographic research is derived from the notes of anthropologists as they documented the lives of communities they observed.

My task is to be an unofficial ethnographer of Guy’s efforts to establish the Longhouse Elementary School (LES). I am what Professor called a “participant observer.” I am now in the “data collection” phase of research and I also need to build out a literature review. Later on I will move to “data analysis.”

Of course, Guy and I will be separated from each other by distance. But there is now a discipline called “digital ethnography.” Professor and I worked out that data will consist of Guy’s posts about NHR-1 as a background to his development as a school director, AI-transcribed minutes of our consultant meetings, my journal notes, and interviews and private conversations/texts/social media posts, etc. 

We talked about data privacy and “informed consent.” He also mentioned that the school library has a license for a platform called [QuestionPro](https://www.questionpro.com/research-suite/) which I should start to familiarize myself with. 

But right now I am in the earliest stages. Until I  get familiar with QuestionPro, he introduced me to something called “Personal Knowledge System” apps which can help me collect and organize my notes. Some of them let me handwrite and voicenotes in addition to typing. At this stage of research it is very important to jot down “hunches” which will later guide my research questions. 

From my work I can receive anything from 4 to 16 college credits, or even more! Not only am I studying Guy’s development, but I am probing my own. So I should also document what I am learning about education on the final leg of our 2024-2025 MFL tour. I am so excited!

I became even more excited when we spoke about my literature review. I can include my prior work on Sarah Schenirer and Vasily Sukhominsky. He also had for me a shopping bag of many out-of-print books from his own library. These are publications from school reformers in the 1960s and 1970s which he regards as ethnographies although the authors were not aware that that was what they were doing. They were all cut from the same mold as Uncle Vasily and Sarah.

Specifically a fluffy orange cat - it was listed on my vision board in 2023 and then only reason I didn't put a picture this year is because I didn't think it was possible.

Then comes last Saturday, March 8th!

My roommate and I were about to leave the house to run errands and get coffee when I noticed a fluffy orange cat sitting by a tree and the sun was hitting it perfectly. Like one of those movie moments. I was ready to cry because I had already decided in my head I couldn't have it - but then we made eye contact and I called for the cat....it meowed and instantly ran over.

She is soft and sweet and so beautiful. We sat on the ground outside for thirty minutes as she let us pet her and feed her and pick her up. I didn't want to leave her as she was following us into our house, so my roommate suggested we keep her.

She was so tiny as it looks as though she hadn't eaten in a long time and I checked all our local Facebook groups but no one had reported her missing. We are setting a Vet appointment for next week (their soonest availability) to check for a microchip as well, but I'm hoping there isn't one as she is most definitely still a kitten.

But she has quickly warmed up and after the first few days, no longer scarfs down the food in her bowl as I think she knows that the food will still be waiting for her. She is also definitely much rounder than before! We have two other cats, but we're keeping them separated until the Vet visit (if we can hold out that long) and/or until we get a baby gate or a screen to keep them separated for meeting.

Thank you Cat Distribution System for giving me a darling that I have always wanted that I didn't know I needed until now...especially when I realized my Spring Depression hits around this time so she was perfect. I think she needed me as much as I needed her.

In Mrs Beeton's *Book of Household Management*, she says that:

>1806. With respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the decoction, much depends upon the taste of the consumer. The greatest and most common fault in English coffee is the too small quantity of the ingredient. Count Rumford says that to make good coffee for drinking after dinner, a pound of good Mocha coffee, which, when roasted and ground, weighs only thirteen ounces, serves to make fifty-six full cups, or a little less than a quarter of an ounce to a coffee-cup of moderate size.

and provides this recipe,

>*Mode*.—Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee-pot inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the pot, pour some boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well warmed, put the ground coffee into the bag; pour over as much boiling water as is required, close the lid, and, when all the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the coffee to table. Making it in this manner **prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which cools and spoils it**. The water should be poured on the coffee gradually, so that the infusion may be stronger; and the bag must be well made, that none of the grounds may escape through the seams, and so make the coffee thick and muddy.

I've put the relevant bit in bold - was this method really ubiquitous given the intent not to transfer the coffee from one pot to another? I can't imagine restaurants doing this, and I seriously question how ubiquitous this practise would have been since Mrs Beeton often recommends methods that weren't actually common. She does also provide a method with a coffee urn, but of course these would only be found in select households.

Basically, does anyone know or have any suggestions for texts explaining how coffee may have been prepared without urns and without the above muslin bag method (which I can't imagine was ever ubiquitous)? Given that the moka pot wasn't invented until 1933, and there doesn't seem to be an indication in literature that people used pre-moka boiler coffee makers, how was coffee prepared by most people?",3,1741955871.0,AskHistorians,1,1.0,False

When I was 16 in 2023, my family and I moved to a new state in Australia because of personal reasons I won't get into. This meant going to a new school with no one familiar in my last 2 crucial years of high school. I thought I made new friends when this girl was kind enough to show me where my next class was on my first day of school. She invited me to sit with her friends and I thought they would be nice. Although, they didn't really bother to get to know me. One day, I pulled out a book I was reading, specifically ""Hooked"" by Emily McIntire, and I wanted to read while the others chatted amongst themselves because I read the room and they're talking about things I can't really contribute to. One of the girls asked what I was reading because they were a book lover too and I guess it made me happy that I was noticed. I explained what it was about and I thought she was interested in it. I guess where it went down is when I said there's spice and I told her if it's not her cup of tea, she doesn't have to read it. I thought that was the end of that.

A month later, I eventually distanced myself from that group because I was seriously not being involved and they would ignore me most of the time anyway so I just pulled myself out of there before they could tell me they didn't want me there. I began dating the guy who I mentioned is my boyfriend now. We were on a coffee date after school and he said that one of his friends told him about how I mentioned a guy caught my eye when I was new to the school and he turned out to be a sexual assaulter. That same friend is with one of the girls in the group romantically and I knew that info at the time. I asked what else have they said about me. They called me ""the girl who reads porn in school"". I remember brushing it off back then but now I've graduated and I've started uni, I couldn't help but remember how awful my experience was when I was new to the school.

Reason why I'm bringing this up now is because my boyfriend doesn't like the way I ramble about the male characters in the books and it's mostly how they set the standard so high because of how they treat the female character. In no way did I compare him to them, I was rambling about both the plot and the characters to him because he was my only friend at the time. He brought it up again today when he sent a tiktok relevant to that and he said it's gross.

Idk I just wanted to vent here because my boyfriend is bad when I'm emotional and he sees things logically. He's the kind of boyfriend that gives solutions when I just want someone to listen to me. Sorry if all doesn't make sense. I just needed to let it out somewhere.

Side note: I do have a great group of friends now and I am very grateful for them. Althought, they wouldn't understand because we all only got to know each other a 2 months before high school ended and they didn't really know I existed when I was new.",1,1741955718.0,venting,1,1.0,False

Not typing, not building spreadsheets. Just asking questions — and getting answers.

Because here’s the brutal truth:

**You don’t want to track your money.**  
**You want to understand where it’s going.**

But you’ve been convinced that in order to “understand,” you have to:  
📌 Log every transaction manually  
📌 Categorize every coffee  
📌 Analyze charts like a Wall Street analyst

All that… just to ask *one damn question* in the end:

“Where the hell did my money go?”

 That’s not control. That’s a spreadsheet-shaped prison.  


# 🎙️ Enter FIN AI — The app that skips the bullshit.

You don’t enter data.  
You don’t stare at charts.  
You don’t need to “manage” anything.

You just ask:

“How much did I spend on food this month?”  
“What category is bleeding me dry?”  
“Will I make it to the next paycheck?”

📲 You say it — FIN AI answers. Right in Telegram. In seconds.  
  
No prep. No setup. Just the truth. On demand.  


# 💡 Think about it.

You’re not budgeting because you love it.  
You’re doing it because you don’t trust yourself.

You’re scared of losing control.  
Scared of seeing that balance hit zero.  
Scared of what the numbers might say.

But instead of facing that?  
You hide behind spreadsheets.

# ⚡ Here’s the better way — FIN AI

🧠 Hate data entry? → Just speak.  
📊 Hate categorizing? → FIN sorts it for you.  
❓ Have a money question? → Ask. Get the answer.

This isn’t about discipline.  
It’s about honesty.  


**You either control your money.**

**Or it controls you.**

Stop blaming “bad timing” or “low income.”  
If your card is empty by the 20th every month — that’s not bad luck. That’s bad habits.

You’ve got a phone. A voice. And now — FIN AI.  


# 🔥 Bottom line:

💳 “It was on sale” — that’s not a deal. That’s a trick.  
🧾 “I’ll start tracking next month” — that’s self-sabotage.  
📉 “I don’t need a budget” — you’re lying to yourself.  


🎯 Don’t start with a spreadsheet. Start with a question.  
FIN AI is your first honest conversation with money.  
No fluff. No friction. Just real answers, instantly.

When he travels intermittently, I get the kids and pets and chores set, sans coffee- I don't need a pot, even a small one, just for me, and never seem to get the measurements right. Whatever, this isn't about my incompetence. A few weeks ago a friend, who's hubby, also is in charge of coffee, was laughing how she was ""still drinking yesterday's when today's showed up.""

Huh? See, her husband, when he's traveling, DoorDashes coffee to her. He knows she won't make any, is managing everything and more in his absence, and wants to make sure she has something to get her day started. Not every day, but frequently. Or sends lunch. You get the idea. 

My heart melted for her. Never not once have I experienced this.  Yes, we have DoorDash/similar, yes we have the means, but he'd have to actually think of me to do this. I doubt he'd know my order after 25 years.  I mentioned how friend's hubby did that, hint hint, and the responses were predictable - why would we spend extra money delivering that, you can just go down the street and get it.

First, he would lie about small stuff like that he didn't watch porn (neither do I) -- I wouldn't judge him if he did, I just thought it was a nice compatibility. Recently I started getting a weird feeling in my gut during the nights we spent apart, and I told him I thought he was watching porn. He denied it at first, but eventually admitted it.   
This sparked a larger conversation where I brought up other things I've been feeling weird about. For example, he once mentioned wanting to meet up with a friend from college since she was in town. I asked if they'd had a romantic relationship in college, and he said no. Again, eventually, he admitted that they had. I thanked him for being honest and I said that that's in the past and though I might feel a bit jealous there's nothing wrong with seeing her. He became very defensive and said he didn't care about seeing her. This was last month.  
A few days ago, he admits that he did go and get coffee with her behind my back. I believe him that nothing romantic or sexual happened -- he was just afraid that I would get mad if he told me. I still felt very betrayed.  
I brought up all these different women who he follows on Instagram who he claimed he'd never spoken to, he claims he just happens to like/reply to their comments. He admitted that yes, he does reply to their stories etc.  
All of this up to this point seems pretty ""normal"" and like white lies to me. But then he admitted that he replies to the stories of/is attracted to this one woman who he knows has been extremely cruel to me, has gone around spreading horrific rumors about me. This felt like a knife in my chest.

Him admitting to all of this and swearing he is going to change and explaining it came from a place of fear, of not internally being ready to commit, makes me feel some hope that things will be different. But at the same time, I fear that I will always be suspicious of him. Then again, everyone has their flaws -- is this one I can learn to deal with?

Has anyone dealt with a partner with this pattern of behavior? Has it changed upon being excavated and talked about? To be clear, I showed him my phone, proved that I have never engaged in any type of this behavior. I was (am?) so, so in love with him and so devoted to him. It wouldn't have ever crossed my mind to do such a thing or not to have faith in the relationship. I feel stupid, confused, and scared that these small lies will eventually turn into big ones.

Decidedly non-tech guy here. The complaints are not complaints (mostly), they’re observations. Some of the things good and bad are really not universal because of my personal circumstances. Anyway…

Lifting it out the box: I’m not sure about the curved edge on the underside…

I’ve had the rainbow wheel a couple of times in iMovie , which was unexpected. Maybe it’s settling in?

In iMovie, the clip at the bottom that you stretch out and edit? Half the clip (the part I haven’t scrubbed through) is often just blue and has to be nudged to populate with the images. Did not expect that, not happy at all. These are 1-5GB GoPro clips. This is weird with the specs, right?

The screen on my old one was dying for the past two years. Colours were muted and the screen was dark. Burn in too. Obviously no more burn in but the colours look fucking weird. To the point where I checked it was on colour LCD. I KNOW it’s my eyes adjusting but I no longer like my wallpaper as it’s too harsh. It didn’t look too harsh on day 1 of my Intel. I’m halfway through watching Scarface (1983) on it which coincidentally is a very colourful film and yeesh! Am I complaining about seeing colours properly? Yes. Do I know that’s ridiculous? Yes, but it doesn’t help how gaudy it looks right now.

Do my new specs improve the speed at which I download things from the internet? That’s a genuine question but my guess is it’s just down to my connection speed. I’ve had a few failed attempts from my GoPro cloud.

I don’t prefer this curved underside. There’s something reassuringly sharp about the old one that tells me I’m really holding the fucker. This feels more slippery.

The notch hasn’t bothered me yet (the top of my current wallpaper is black), but I know my iPhone crops videos to fill the screen (notch and curved edges) and I’m hoping this doesn’t do the same. We’ll see! 

Biggest WTF moment was not having keys for the keyboard brightness. I use the Mac all the time switching from watching videos with it off to typing in low-ish light where I need it on. I used those keys literally hundreds of times a day. It was like pushing my glasses back up my nose; I didn’t think about it. I’ve added it to the menu but it’s going to take a lot of getting used to.

Aside from the blue screen sometimes, using iMovie to edit and export GoPro footage is now so dreamlike I want to fucking cry. Can’t wait until I get the workflow tuned and can do it even faster. I have hundreds of barely organised/labelled iPhone and GoPro footage of a once-in-a-lifetime trip in 2023 that my old Mac could barely process, and if it did it took hours and hours. I couldn’t even play most of it smoothly let alone edit and export and it’s the main reason for the spec bump. Did I overshoot? Maybe, but if it keeps working like this I’ll never have to wonder if I didn’t get enough, and I’m very fortunate to be in a position where the extra cost is worth the peace of mind to me. 

Yesterday I edited three GP files into one and made a 7-minute video of me on a guided tour of the Teatro Amazonas in 2023. 1.9GB thank you very much.

Does that microphone button turn on talk to Siri? I can investigate when I get home. I turned Siri off on my old one because I always have my phone with me and ended up talking to two devices. With Chatty G available I want to use Siri on my Mac. I set it to only respond to “Hey Siri” which will go some small way to stopping the confusion. I think Apple is missing a trick by not allowing just “Siri” to be an option so I can essentially have different names for each device. If I say “Siri” I know only my phone will reply, but “Hey Siri” will wake them both up.

Way too much coffee, sorry. I love my new Mac but some things are a struggle to adjust to.

1jb2go3,https://www.reddit.com/r/arbeitsleben/comments/1jb2go3/verzweiflung_in_der_bewerbungsphase_brauche/,Verzweiflung in der Bewerbungsphase – brauche Feedback zu meinem Lebenslauf,"**Hi zusammen,**

ich stecke gerade in der Bewerbungsphase fest und bekomme ausschließlich Absagen – keine einzige positive Rückmeldung bei rund 25 Bewerbungen. Langsam frustriert mich das, denn selbst eine Einladung zu einem Gespräch wäre schon ein kleiner Lichtblick, auch wenn es am Ende nicht klappen sollte.



**Zu mir:**

• Ich habe ein Praktikum bei einem internationalen Sportartikelhersteller gemacht und ein sehr gutes Arbeitszeugnis erhalten.

• Meine Ausbildung habe ich in einem mittelständischen Unternehmen mit Fokus auf Radsport absolviert – ein Online-Shop mit mehreren hochpreisigen Offline-Stores.

• Mein Studium geht in Richtung Sportmarketing & Journalismus, und ich bewerbe mich auf Einstiegsstellen im Bereich Marketing.



Ich fokussiere mich hauptsächlich auf **Brand Marketing und Event Marketing**, was mein absoluter Favorit wäre, aber auch **Sales und andere marketingnahe Bereiche** – und das branchenübergreifend, nicht nur im Sport. Trotzdem: Keine Chance bisher. Auch bei Jobs, bei denen ich mich für überqualifiziert gehalten hätte.



Natürlich weiß ich, dass ich mich auf stark umkämpfte Stellen bewerbe, aber so langsam frage ich mich, ob mit meinem Lebenslauf oder meiner Bewerbung etwas nicht stimmt. **Was meint ihr?** Ich würde mich über ehrliches Feedback freuen.



Mir ist nur wichtig, im inhouse-Team eines Unternehmens zu landen – Agenturen kommen für mich nicht infrage.



Danke für eure Hilfe!

1jb2gfe,https://i.redd.it/301y0fyocnoe1.jpeg,Follow-up on coffee table base.,"That was an overwhelming win for #2. So i did a mockup in poplar. I like it quite a bit, ill taper the legs to be narrower at the base. Wouldve loved to try #3 just for skills as my first furniture built, but there will be other battles to be conquered, im looking at you patterned drawer faces coming up next. 
PS: I did all the tapering angles on a microjig marchfit sled i made earlier this week, and i dont think ive ever had more fun working with wood since starting this hobby. 
Quick question on how to attach the base, from what im understanding, either z clips in slots or figure 8 things, to allow for movement, right?",163,1741954371.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,18,0.99,False

1jb2f9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jb2f9m/31m_going_on_a_dinner_date_with_a_60f/,31M going on a dinner date with a 60+F,"Ive been going to the same Cafe for the last couple of months. One day I took notice of a lady that was clearly significantly older than myself. I was ordering a second coffee to go and she was behind me, about to order herself another coffee before getting back to her laptop. I asked her to order at the same time as me because they're relatively inexpensive at this cafe, especially an expresso. 

A couple days later I saw her again, working away on her laptop. I got her another coffee on my way out with my take away. That's the first time we had a good chat but we didnt exchanged names or details, we both remained mysterious to one another but i think we were both confident that our paths would cross again. 

I went away on holiday for a few weeks and saw her again at the Cafe and we exchanged a quick smile and wave. A couple more days passed and today I saw her again and went over to see what she was working on. Finally, I introduced myself and she gave me her name. 

Little more context: I'm probably on the spectrum a little but I'm handsome as fuck so talking to girls isn't a big issue, eye contact sometimes is, but not with this lady. She's absolutely stunning.. I'd say better than 90% of the girls i meet between 21-35. She works in government and is starting a not for profit animal rescue and sanctuary. I'm a creative/founder/entrepreneur which is why we're both floating around a coffee shop mid week taking life easy.

I asked if she had any children, she replied no. I asked if she had a partner, she said no, followed by 'atm'. I asked her if she wanted to take me out to dinner one day. She asked why she would be taking me. I told her she's clearly older than me and also the rules of reciprocity states that those two coffees I had bought her in the past were investments and need to pay dividends. She was a touch hesitant at first but was quick to pull up her calander as soon as I was on the booking page for the restaurant I wanted to take her. We found a day and i asked her if she preferred the 6.15pm or 8pm table, she replied 8pm, I asked if it would be getting close to her bedtime. 

So we have a date, an actual date date, to finally get to know each other a little more. Am i  nervous? Yes. Intimidated? No fucking way.

Im fairly mature, have my shit sorted, it's hard dating people my age. Their brains are rotten from all the dating apps. I haven't been on one for 8 years where I met my wife. We've been seperated for many months and almost legally allowed to file for divorce. I've been with a bunch of girls since that relationship died and can really differentiate the difference between a girl and a woman, and a woman is what I would like in my life. I don't think I've met a woman under 30.

I guess the possible narrative in my head is that I could be with this lady till she dies and by that stage I'll be 50+ and then the girls of today will hopefully be woman in there late 30s, early 40s. 

Anyways, wish me luck. ",0,1741954262.0,AskMenAdvice,76,0.46,False
