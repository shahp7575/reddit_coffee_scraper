The event is 2,5 hours and includes underglaze decorations (which will take place after the coffee/food break while i dry the pieces a bit).   
  
Here is how i plan it but please let me know if you have any suggestions or tweaks or tips:  
  
\- start with small bit of clay each; I demonstrate the pinch method to build a vessel while they also play with the clay, familiarising with the texture, trying out the technique etc..10-15mins mins  
\- build the vessel (with pre-prep'd balls of clay) -  we all pinch together  30-40 mins - i walk around for support. we go at the same rythme, they prepare the handle for those who want handles.  
\- Break - 15-20 mins. i speed dry the pieces (yes, controversial, but works)  
\- attach handles - 30 mins to allow for any bumps.  
\- the rest of the time to smooth, fix imperfections and decorate.

Any tips, tweaks on methodology are super welcome.",1,1769163390.0,Pottery,1,1.0,False

I started 20 mg XR in the morning, but found that it lasts me only about 6-7 hours. Other than that, its been life changing. I tolerate it well, with no side affects other than slight loss of appetite.  
  
When I brought up the fact that the effects run out in the mid afternoon, and I need to do work into the evening, my doctor was very hesitant of giving me another dose, even an IR. It was unusual since she was very open to increasing doses when I started. She asked me to start drinking coffee with fat, specifically a bullet coffee, in the afternoon to ""extend the adderals effects.""

About me:
I’m easygoing, curious, and a good listener with a playful side once I’m comfortable. I love movies, cycling, hiking, long walks, and discovering new food spots. Fun fact: I’ve never had alcohol before, so if you feel like being part of someone’s “first drink” story this weekend, that could be dangerous (in a cute way).

Weekend vibes I’m hoping for:
Coffee that accidentally turns into dinner
A chill cycle or walk where we talk about random things
Movie night (cinema or cozy at home)
Laughing, flirting a little, and forgetting work exists for a bit

If you’re also tired of work and want a sweet, low-pressure date or just genuinely nice company DM me. Worst case, we have a good conversation. Best case… who knows 😉",1,1769163141.0,indiansinsingapore,0,1.0,False
1qkn20e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qkn20e/i_cannot_stand_my_boyfriends_mother/,I cannot stand my boyfriends mother,"I don’t know where to start and this may all be a bunch of blabber but idc and I just need to scream it into the void. sorry this is the longest post ever lmfao 

\*\*\*TW for very brief mention of my past ED. \*\*\*

I’ve lived with my boyfriend and his parents for 5 years, we are both 25.

It was quick, about 2 months into us dating, but we have never regretted it.  We also intend to buy a home this year so this won’t be happening for \*hopefully\* much longer.

To give you context why I have such an issue - we live in a townhouse, with one kitchen. it’s actually really nice! just small. 

Him and I are very happy together, though one of my BIGGEST issues in our relationship, is his mother.

She is Italian (2nd gen immigrant), and very nice. genuinely. I know (okay.. I hope\*) she does what she does out of love and care for me and her son, but oh my god. 

From the very beginning, I noticed how ... overbearing she is about absolutely everything my boyfriend (and now I) do. like, the moment you step foot into her zone, she is alert, watching you, and is ready to jump in and overtake you to finish the task you already started. 

for example: (and the MOST common example that happens 5-6 days/week)

I (and/or my bf) will come downstairs to make food/get water, etc. His mother WFH, and unfortunately does not have a private office, so she works RIGHT next to the kitchen. We walk in the area, we say hi, blah blah, and start getting our stuff done. almost immediately, she (even though she’s working???) will get up from her desk, and start to do something (get herself more coffee or snack). so she is taking up the \*VERY\* small kitchen space by doing this, essentially booting me and my bf out of the way. OR I will be making something for me and bf, and she will look up to see what I’m doing, ask me ""what are you making?"", I’ll tell her, and she will say ""oh there’s \[insert food/drink option\], why don’t you have that instead?"" I’ll respond, politely, ""no thanks, \[bf\] asked for this"" \*OR\*  ""no thanks! this is good for me/us right now"" and she will GET UP to take it out and continue to pressure me and bf.

She does this with almost every meal I or bf make, whether it be a food suggestion, or even using a different pan/plate/fork/knife, or just taking over and doing it for us.

To be fair, in my home, it was always one person in the kitchen cooking, and let them be, since we had a small kitchen, it got cramped, FAST. I hate being crowded when I cook or told what to eat, as I feel I'm being stripped of my autonomy over what I eat. (I had a binge eating disorder in the past before meeting bf and still struggle with my relationship with food). So I am NOTTTT used to this behaviour at all. 

Now, I’ve talked to her about this, my bf has as well, but it just... never clicks for her. it’s like an inherent NEED to control what we are doing. I know being Italian, food is a HUGE part of their culture. like I’ve seen his Italian family and how everyone is in the kitchen helping each other and yapping and telling each other what to do. 

But when I’m in the kitchen, I hate it. LIKE why! 

The reason I’m posting tonight is because I’m on a physical health journey, as I’ve struggled with my weight for a while. I’m working out, but the diet aspect is particularly difficult (for reasons noted above with my relationship with food). I’m on a calorie deficit, and I’m trying to minimize my carb intake since that’s a big weakness for me when I’m hungry. Bf and I go downstairs, and his mum is sitting in the area by the kitchen/work desk, watching TV(as always- though there is a ""living room"" where she can watch TV too). from this spot, she can see everything we are doing.

We have 2 cats, and I go to feed them dinner, while I do this, I notice their food mat is yucky, so I pop it in the sink (empty btw), and take the washcloth and some dawn dish soap, scrub it, and leave in the sink, as I then noticed we are out of paper towels. During this time, bf is getting our plates out to make our dinner. I go upstairs to grab the paper towels, and come back down to see his mum in the kitchen looking at the cat food mat in the sink. she asked me why I did that.. I’m like ""it was messy so I just wanted to give it a quick wash! :) "" she’s like ""in the sink...?"" I’m like ""yeah?... I just used some soap and washed it clean..."" after a pause she’s goes ""well.. we really shouldn’t have the cat stuff mixed in the sink when we put our dishes here..and the cloth has to be washed now too"" so I pause, look at my bf, and he’s like ""😒"" looking at his mum, and so I respond ""okay.. I’m sorry. I didn’t know that you didn’t want that, I’ll get some lysol wipes to disinfect the sink and grab a new scrub cloth"" she’s says ""no it’s fine, I’ll do it""

now idk if I’m in the wrong there, but to be really honest,  my bf and I have washed that mat in the sink MULTIPLE times and never had this issue come up before (I guess we never did it with her around), I never saw an issue with it, as we replace the scrub cloth after cleaning the mat anyway. So she starts cleaning everything up herself, and now my bf and I are just standing, watching her. I’m PISSED atp bc :

1. she saw me pick up the mat, put it in the sink, and wash it, but never said anything until I left and came back. 

2. she ONCE AGAIN took over what I was doing

So, I’m just quietly trying to cool off, when my bf is trying to get in the kitchen and get our dinner started. 

He was having mini pizzas, and I was having an omelette with veggies and pepperoni. 

As he’s getting his stuff out first, his mum asks ""why don’t you have any \[OP\]?"" I say ""well I had a grilled cheese earlier today so I need to really limit my carbs in this meal since today is my rest day from the gym"", bf nods and continues to clear some space. 

bf mum: but it’s not that bad! the crust only has.... 38g of carbs!

me: yeah that’s too much for me since it’s a really small pizza and carb dense , so I’d still be hungry 

bf mum: but what if I \*proceeds to rip up one of the pizza crusts so that only the bottom layer is left\* cut it in half?

bf: no mom that’s still a lot for her and she said she didn’t want it

me: yeah, I wish I could say yes but I have to be disciplined here. I’m sorry no thank you

her: but okay wait cmon it’ll be so good 

... 15 mins later of the discussion at hand, where we recount the carbs in the bread from the grilled cheese, pizza crust, and pepperoni, where I’m being told constantly what I should be eating. 

I’m beyond pissed and insecure at this point, so I tell my bf and his mum that I’m sorry, I have my own insecurities, and that I’m projecting their opinions/suggestions as negative connotations about me, and that I need to leave the area. 

I go upstairs, cry, bf follows and comforts me, then I go back downstairs to see if I can make my own food. NOPE. she already made my omelette.

I tell her thank you, I appreciate her making my food, I apologize for being upset, and my bf and I go upstairs to eat. 

I just... I don’t understand it. I couldn’t wash something right, I couldn’t select my dinner, I couldn’t make it. my bf couldn’t make his dinner... EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. 

Fuck. 

Thank you for reading if you got this far. 

I hope it makes sense.

1qkmzqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qkmzqt/the_good_samaritan/,The Good Samaritan,"The Corolla died three miles past the last exit sign, the engine cutting out with a shudder that I felt in my teeth. I coasted onto the shoulder and sat there in the dark, hazards clicking, watching semis blast past and rock the car in their wake.

My phone showed one bar. Then none. Then one again.

The tow company put me on hold before a woman with a smoker's rasp told me two hours, minimum. Maybe three. Dispatcher said there'd been a pile-up west of Barstow and they were running every truck they had.

""There's a rest stop about a mile ahead,"" the woman said. ""If you want to wait somewhere with a bathroom.""

I looked at the desert darkness beyond my headlights. A mile didn't sound far. A mile sounded like a death sentence.

""I'll stay with the car.""

""Suit yourself. Driver'll call when he's twenty out.""

The line went dead. I locked the doors and turned off the hazards to save the battery and sat in the darkness, watching my phone screen dim and brighten and dim again.

A pickup pulled onto the shoulder behind me.

I watched it in the rearview. White Ford, maybe ten years old, work lights mounted on the roof rack. It sat there for a full minute before the driver's door opened and a man stepped out.

He was mid-fifties, maybe. Thick through the shoulders. He wore a denim jacket and walked with the unhurried gait of someone who had nowhere else to be. When he reached my window, he made a little circular motion with his finger.

I cracked the window two inches.

""Car trouble?"" His voice was gentle. Midwestern, maybe. The kind of voice that read bedtime stories and knew all the words to church hymns.

""Tow truck's coming.""

""That's good."" He nodded, looking at my hood like he could diagnose the problem through it. ""How long they say?""

""Two hours.""

""Two hours."" He repeated it like he was tasting the words. ""That's a long time to sit on the side of the 15. You got water? Gets cold out here at night, but you'd be surprised how fast you dehydrate.""

""I'm fine.""

""Rest stop's about a mile up. Vending machines, bathroom, good overhead lighting. Safer than sitting here in the dark.""

""I'll wait with the car.""

He smiled. His teeth were very white and very straight, the kind of teeth that cost money. ""Smart. Don't trust strangers. That's smart."" He patted the roof of my car twice, gently, the way you'd pat a dog. ""You need anything, I'll be at that rest stop. White Ford. Name's Gary.""

""Thank you.""

""Don't mention it.""

He walked back to his truck. Didn't hurry. Didn't look back. The Ford pulled around me and merged onto the highway, taillights dwindling until they disappeared.

I realized I'd been holding my breath.

The temperature in the car dropped until I could see my breath. I started the engine to run the heater. It turned over, coughed, died. I tried again. Nothing.

I got out and started walking.

The desert was louder than I'd expected. Wind through scrub brush, the distant keen of something that might have been a coyote, the hiss of sand against my jeans. The highway was a black river to my left, cars passing in bursts of light and noise that left me more alone each time they faded.

The rest stop appeared as a glow on the horizon first, then resolved into a concrete rectangle surrounded by parking lot lights on tall poles. Two big rigs sat at the far end, dark and silent, their drivers asleep in the cabs. A sedan with Nevada plates sat near the bathroom entrance.

And the white Ford, parked directly under the brightest light.

Gary sat on a picnic bench near the vending machines, reading a paperback. He looked up when I entered the pool of light and smiled like I was an old friend arriving at a party.

""Decided to take me up on it.""

""Car won't start.""

""Battery, probably. Sitting with the hazards on drains them faster than people think."" He closed his book, something with an old Western cover.

""I'm fine.""

""Water, then. You look cold.""

I was cold. My jacket was in the car. I'd walked a mile in a thin sweater because the thought of going back for it felt like admitting I'd be out here longer than I could stand.

""Okay. Water. Thank you.""

He fed quarters into the machine and retrieved a bottle, brought it to me with both hands extended like an offering. When I took it, his fingers didn't linger. He stepped back immediately, maintaining a distance that felt calculated to reassure.

""I didn't catch your name.""

""Claire.""

""Claire."" He smiled again. ""Pretty name. Old-fashioned. You don't hear it much anymore.""

""It was my grandmother's.""

""That's nice. Keeping it in the family."" He returned to the picnic bench, sitting on the table with his feet on the seat, hands folded in his lap. Patient. Unhurried. ""You call the tow company again? Let them know where you are?""

""Not yet.""

""Signal's better over by the bathrooms. Something about the building, I think. Metal in the roof blocks the interference.""

I walked to the bathroom entrance. Gary didn't follow. I checked my phone and found two bars, solid. The tow company picked up after three rings.

""He's still working the pile-up,"" the woman said. ""Shouldn't be too much longer. You're next on his list.""

""Can you tell him I'm at the rest stop? Mile past where my car broke down?""

""I'll let him know.""

I hung up. When I turned around, Gary was standing ten feet away.

""Get through?""

""Yeah. Still waiting on the pile-up.""

""Those can take a while. Depends on how bad it is, how many vehicles."" He tilted his head. ""You want to sit? Benches aren't comfortable, but they're better than standing.""

We sat at the picnic table, across from each other. Gary picked up his paperback and set it aside. The cover showed a man in a black hat pointing a revolver at something outside the frame.

""You read Westerns?"" I asked.

""Louis L'Amour, mostly. My father used to read them. Reminds me of him.""

""Is he still around?""

""Passed when I was thirty. Heart attack. Quick, at least.""

A semi pulled into the rest stop, air brakes hissing. The driver climbed down from the cab, a heavy man in a flannel shirt, and walked to the bathroom without looking at either of us.

Gary watched him go. ""Truckers don't sleep enough. Read an article about it once. They take pills to stay awake, drive eighteen, twenty hours at a stretch. Then they pull off and crash for a few hours and do it again. Hell of a way to make a living.""

""What do you do?""

""Contractor. Kitchens and bathrooms, mostly. Remodels."" He held up his hands, showing me the calluses. ""Good honest work. Keeps me busy.""

""You're out late for a contractor.""

""Couldn't sleep. Happens sometimes. I drive when it gets bad. Helps clear my head."" He smiled. ""You married, Claire?""

""Divorced.""

""Kids?""

""No.""

""That's probably for the best. Divorce is hard enough without kids in the middle."" He was watching the trucker's rig now, waiting. ""I've got a daughter. Lives in Portland. Works for one of those tech companies, the kind where they have ping-pong tables in the office and call their employees a family.""

""That's nice.""

""We don't talk much anymore.""

The trucker came out of the bathroom, still not looking at us, and climbed back into his cab. The engine rumbled to life. Headlights swept the parking lot as he pulled out, and then we were alone.

""You're nervous,"" Gary said. It wasn't a question.

""I'm just tired.""

""You're nervous because you're smart. Woman alone, middle of the night, stranger being friendly."" He nodded slowly. ""I tell my daughter the same thing. Trust your instincts. Be careful. The world isn't safe for women the way it's safe for men. Never has been.""

""That's good advice.""

""Is it?"" He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. ""Here's what I wonder about, Claire. What good does being careful do if the danger doesn't look like danger? If it looks like a guy in a denim jacket reading Louis L'Amour at a rest stop? If it looks like help?""

I didn't answer.

""My daughter,"" Gary said. ""The reason we don't talk. Her mother told her something before she died. A warning. Stay away from your father. Don't be alone with him. Don't trust him.""

""Why would she say that?""

""Because she knew me. Better than anyone ever has."" He picked up the paperback and turned it over in his hands, not looking at the cover. ""Claire, I've been doing this drive for three years now. Every few weeks, when I can't sleep. And I stop here every time. Right here at this rest stop. You know why?""

""Why?""

""Because people break down out here. All the time. Forty miles of nothing in either direction, cell service that barely works, tow trucks that take forever. And most of the time, people just wait it out. But sometimes there's a woman. Alone. Stranded. And I see her car on the shoulder, and I think to myself, she's exactly the kind of person that bad things happen to out here. Wouldn't it be something if I could help. If I could just make sure she's safe until her ride comes.""

""That's very kind.""

""No. It isn't."" He set the book down. ""Kindness would be driving past. Kindness would be minding my own business. But I can't seem to do that. I see a woman alone in the dark, and I have to stop. I have to.""

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I didn't reach for it.

""You should check that,"" Gary said. ""Might be your tow truck.""

I pulled out my phone. Text from an unknown number: En route. 20 mins.

""He's coming,"" I said. ""Twenty minutes.""

""Good. That's good."" Gary stood up from the bench. ""Walk with me.""

""I should wait here. Where he can see me.""

""He'll find you. Walk with me. Just to the edge of the light. I want to show you something.""

We walked together toward the edge of the parking lot, where the overhead lights gave way to desert darkness. Gary stayed a half-step behind me, just in my peripheral vision. I could hear him breathing, slow and even.

""This is the spot,"" he said.

I stopped. The highway was visible in the distance, headlights appearing and disappearing.

""What am I looking at?""

""Nothing. That's the point. You can't see anything from here. Someone in the rest stop, they can't see us. Someone on the highway, they're going too fast to notice. We're invisible.""

I turned to face him. ""What do you want?""

""I want to tell you something. Something I've never told anyone."" He put his hands in his pockets, and I flinched before I could stop myself. He noticed. ""I'm not going to hurt you, Claire. That's not what this is. But I need you to understand what you're standing next to. What you've been sitting across from for the last hour. What you took water from.""

""Okay.""

""I've never hurt anybody. Not in the way my daughter thinks. Not in the way you're thinking right now."" He paused. ""But I've thought about it. I've thought about it more than I've thought about anything else in my life. Since I was fourteen years old, I've thought about what it would be like. The sound it would make. How it would feel in my hands. Whether they'd fight or freeze or beg. I've read about it. I've planned it. I've driven out here, to this exact spot, and I've walked women to this exact place, and I've imagined it so clearly that sometimes I can't tell the difference between what I've done and what I've only wanted to do.""

My legs felt locked in place. Later, I would wonder why I didn't run. Later, I would lie awake for months turning this moment over, trying to understand the paralysis.

""Say something,"" Gary said.

""What do you want me to say?""

""I don't know. That's the thing. I've never gotten this far before. The other times, I walked them out here, and I made small talk, and I let them go, and they never knew. They got in their cars or their tow trucks and they drove away and they never thought about me again. Just a nice man at a rest stop. But tonight I wanted to say it out loud. I wanted someone to know.""

""Why me?""

""I don't know."" He smiled, and it was worse than anything else he'd done because it looked genuine. Warm. ""Maybe because you look like you'd understand. You've got that look, Claire. Like you've seen things. Like you know the world isn't what people pretend it is.""

""I don't understand this at all.""

""No. I guess you don't."" He looked at the desert, at the darkness beyond the parking lot lights. ""My wife figured it out. Took her twenty years, but she figured it out. Not what I'd done, because I haven't done anything. What I am. She could see it in me, she said. Something behind my eyes. Something that wasn't like other people. She stayed with me anyway, because she thought she could fix it, or save me, or some other thing that women tell themselves when they love someone they shouldn't love. And when she was dying, when she knew she couldn't protect anyone anymore, she told our daughter. She said, your father is a monster. He's never done anything, but he is. Stay away from him. And my daughter believed her. Because my wife wasn't a liar. My wife was the most honest person I've ever known. And if she said I was a monster, then I was.""

""Are you?""

Gary looked at me for a long time. ""I don't know. I think about it all the time, and I still don't know. What makes someone a monster? Is it what they do, or what they want to do? If I live my whole life without hurting anyone, am I still a monster because I wanted to? Because I thought about it every single day? Because the only reason I didn't was fear, not conscience?""

""I don't know either.""

""No. You don't."" He took a step toward me, and I stepped back, and he stopped. ""That's the first time you've moved away from me. The whole night, that's the first time. You didn't move away when I walked up to your car. You didn't move away when I brought you the water. You didn't move away when we sat at the table, when we walked out here, when I told you what I was. But now you move. Why now?""

""Because now I believe you.""

""Good."" He nodded. ""That's good. You should believe me."" He took his hands out of his pockets, slowly, showing me they were empty. ""Your tow truck's going to be here soon. You should go wait by the road.""

""What are you going to do?""

""Drive home. Go to bed. Wake up tomorrow and give an estimate on a bathroom remodel in Rancho Cucamonga."" He smiled again. ""That's the thing about people like me, Claire. We look like everybody else. We sound like everybody else. We do bathroom remodels and read Louis L'Amour and stop to help women whose cars have broken down. And most of the time nothing happens, because the circumstances aren't right, or the risk is too high, or we just decide not to. But the wanting is always there. Every single day. And you'll never be able to tell. Not until it's too late.""

He turned and walked back toward the rest stop, hands in his pockets, unhurried. I watched him until he reached his truck. He got in, started the engine, and pulled out onto the highway heading east. Toward Victorville. Toward a house where he lived alone.

I stood at the edge of the parking lot until headlights slowed on the highway and the yellow flash of a tow truck's light bar appeared. The driver pulled into the rest stop and leaned out the window. Young guy, early twenties, apologetic about the wait.

""Hell of a night,"" he said. ""You okay? You look like you saw a ghost.""

I climbed into the passenger seat. Closed the door. Locked it.

""Just cold,"" I said. ""Long wait.""

He talked the whole way back to my car. The pile-up near Barstow, the overtime, his girlfriend who didn't understand why he worked nights. I didn't hear any of it. I was thinking about Portland. About a daughter who believed her mother's warning. About a wife who stayed with a monster for twenty years because she thought she could save him.

The Corolla's battery was dead, just like Gary had said. The driver jumped it in five minutes, and I sat behind the wheel as the engine idled, waiting for the charge to build.

""You good to drive?""

""I'm good.""

""Nearest gas station's about twenty miles. Get yourself some coffee.""

""I will.""

I pulled onto the highway and drove east, toward the glow of Las Vegas on the horizon. In my rearview, the rest stop shrank to a single point of light in all that darkness, and then it was nothing at all.

I never told anyone about Gary. Not the police, not my friends, not the therapist I started seeing. But I need to tell someone. I need people to know he's out there. But what would I say? A man talked to me. A man gave me water. A man walked me to the edge of the light and told me what he was and then drove home to sleep in his bed like any other person.  

Nothing happened.

That was the worst part. Nothing happened, and I couldn't prove anything, and somewhere in Victorville a man with a gentle voice was lying awake in the dark, thinking about the sound it would make. The way it would feel. Whether they'd fight or freeze or beg.

And I would never know if tonight was the night he stopped imagining.

Or tomorrow night.

1qkmy4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qkmy4u/how_to_actually_delete_social_media_without/,How to Actually DELETE Social Media Without Losing Your Mind: The PSYCHOLOGY That Works,"Started researching this after watching my roommate's third failed attempt at quitting Instagram. Dude would delete the app, feel like absolute shit for 48 hours, then reinstall it, claiming he ""needed it for networking."" Watched this happen with like half my friend group. 

So I went deep, studied what actually works from neuroscience research, behavioral psychology, and addiction specialists. Turns out most people fail because they're fighting against their brain's wiring without understanding what's happening. The withdrawal is real, the FOMO is biochemical, and your prefrontal cortex is basically in a cage match with your limbic system.

Here's what I learned from the best sources, podcasts with actual neuroscientists, and people who've successfully done this. 



**1. Understand you're literally fighting an addiction designed by PhDs.**

Social media companies employ behavioral psychologists and neuroscientists specifically to make their platforms addictive. Variable reward schedules (the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive), infinite scroll, notification red dots. These aren't accidents. They're exploiting your dopamine system.

Dr. Anna Lembke's work at Stanford shows that social media creates the same dopamine spikes as gambling or substances. When you quit, you're going through actual withdrawal. Irritability, anxiety, phantom phone vibrations, the works. This typically peaks around day 3-5 and can last 2-3 weeks. Knowing this helps because you're not weak or failing; you're experiencing predictable neurochemistry. 



**2. Do a proper digital declutter, not cold turkey deletion.**

Cal Newport's approach in ""[Digital Minimalism](https://a.co/d/cl9uW3V)"" is probably the most sustainable method I've found. Instead of dramatic deletion followed by inevitable relapse, do a 30-day detox where you remove all optional technologies. During this time, you're not just abstaining, you're actively figuring out what you actually value.

The book won the Best Technology Book award, and Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who's never had social media. His argument isn't ""technology bad"" but rather that we've never consciously chosen how we use these tools. We just adopted them because everyone else did. The 30-day break lets you reintroduce things intentionally based on whether they actually serve your values. 

Most people realize they don't miss 90% of their usage. What they miss is specific: keeping up with certain friends, one hobby community, and event planning. You can often get those benefits through less addictive means. 



**3. Replace the habit loops, don't just delete.**

This is where most people fail. Social media fills dozens of micro-moments throughout your day. Waiting for coffee, bathroom breaks, before bed, first thing in the morning, and standing in line. If you don't consciously replace these habit loops, your brain will keep reaching for the phone out of pure automation.

James Clear's ""[Atomic Habits](https://a.co/d/gVIWwie)"" breaks down exactly how to do this. The book sold over 15 million copies, and Clear worked with NFL teams and Fortune 500 companies on behavior change. His framework: identify the cue (boredom, anxiety, waiting), recognize the craving (stimulation, distraction, connection), and insert a better routine that provides a similar reward.

Practically, this means: keep a book on your phone for waiting moments, use a basic meditation app like [Insight Timer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insight-timer-meditate-sleep/id337472899) for anxiety spirals (the app has 100k free guided meditations and doesn't have social features), and have actual hobbies ready for evening hours. The [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) app is solid for building replacement habits because it gamifies self-care without the comparison and infinite scroll of social media.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is another audio learning app that's been useful for replacing scrolling time. Built by Columbia grads and AI researchers from Google, it generates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and expert interviews on topics you want to learn about. You type in a goal like ""break my phone addiction"" or ""develop better focus habits,"" and it pulls relevant insights to create a custom learning plan. The podcasts adjust to whatever depth you want, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive; some people prefer the calm bedtime voice while others go for something more energetic during commutes. Helps turn mindless scrolling time into actual learning without the dopamine manipulation of social feeds. 



**4. Understand the ""time confetti"" problem.**

Newport talks about how we've shredded our time into tiny pieces, none large enough to do anything meaningful. Social media trains you to expect stimulation every 90 seconds. When you quit, you'll feel intensely bored at first because your brain has forgotten how to handle unstimulated time.

This is actually good. Boredom is where creativity lives. Dr. Sandi Mann's research at the University of Central Lancashire shows boredom activates the default mode network in your brain, the same one active during creative breakthroughs and deep thinking. You need to relearn how to be bored.

Practically, the first two weeks will feel like time is moving through molasses. You'll think you're missing out on everything. You're not. You're just experiencing time at its actual pace instead of the artificially accelerated version social media created. 



**5. Handle the social pressure strategically.**

The biggest pushback I got when researching this: ""but I'll lose touch with people,"" or ""I need it for my career."" Here's the thing: neither is really true, but you need a plan.

For relationships: the people who matter will stay in touch through text, calls, or in person. Social media creates the illusion of connection while preventing actual connection. You're mistaking surveillance for friendship. When you quit, you'll quickly learn who actually values your relationship versus who just liked your posts.

For career/networking: depends on your field, but most people vastly overestimate this. LinkedIn is different from Instagram or TikTok. You can maintain a minimal, professional-only presence without the addictive elements. Set specific times (twice a week for 20 minutes) rather than constant checking. 



**6. Use implementation intentions for high-risk moments.**

Dr. Peter Gollwitzer's research on implementation intentions shows that if-then planning dramatically increases success rates for behavior change. Basically, ""if X situation happens, then I will do Y"" creates automatic responses that bypass willpower.

Examples: ""If I feel bored waiting somewhere, then I will take three deep breaths and observe my surroundings."" ""If I feel FOMO on Friday night, then I will text three friends to make actual plans."" ""If I reach for my phone first thing in the morning, then I will do 10 pushups instead.""

Sounds mechanical, but it works because it removes the decision point where you usually fail. 



**7. Track the benefits to reinforce the behavior.**

Keep a simple note on your phone tracking improvements. Sleep quality, focus duration, anxiety levels, number of real conversations, books finished, whatever matters to you. 

Research from Dr. Melissa Hunt at the University of Pennsylvania found that limiting social media to 30 minutes per day significantly decreased depression, loneliness, and FOMO. Imagine fully deleting it. But you need to consciously notice the improvements, or your brain will default to remembering only what you're ""missing.""

Most people report: better sleep, longer attention span, less comparison anxiety, more present in conversations, more time (obviously), less reactive emotionally. But these benefits accumulate slowly, so tracking helps you see the pattern. 



**8. Prepare for the identity crisis.**

Sounds dramatic, but it's real. If you've been curating an online persona for years, deleting that can feel like deleting part of yourself. Especially if you got validation through likes and followers.

This is actually an opportunity. You get to figure out who you are when you're not performing for an algorithm. Dr. Sherry Turkle's book ""[Reclaiming Conversation](https://a.co/d/ctW3dwi)"" explores how constant connectivity prevents the self-reflection necessary for identity formation. When you're always broadcasting and consuming, you never develop a strong internal sense of self.

The first month offline feels disorienting because you're used to external validation. Then something shifts and you start developing internal validation. You do things because you want to, not because they'd make good content. 



**9. Use friction to your advantage.**

If full deletion feels too extreme, start by adding massive friction. Delete apps but keep accounts. Turn the phone to grayscale. Use website blockers. Remove all notifications. Log out after every use, so you have to manually log back in.

Nir Eyal's ""[Indistractable](https://a.co/d/7nBIAAI)"" has great tactics for this. He's a former gaming industry insider who designed addictive products, then felt guilty and wrote about defending against them. The key insight: making behavior 20 seconds harder makes it significantly less likely to happen.

Most people find that after adding enough friction, they realize they don't actually want to use social media. They just want the dopamine hit, which evaporates when there's effort involved. 



**10. Join the growing ""digital minimalist"" community.**

Ironic, but there are non-social media ways to connect with people doing this. Reddit has communities (though you're trying to quit that too, probably), but there are also Discord servers, email newsletters, and local meetup groups focused on intentional technology use.

Knowing that other people are doing this helps. You're not some weirdo Luddite rejecting progress. You're part of a growing movement of people who want technology to serve them rather than the reverse.

The success rate goes way up when you have even one other person doing it with you. Find an accountability partner, ideally someone you see in person.

Look, this isn't easy. Your brain will come up with incredibly convincing reasons why you need to reinstall. ""Just to check one thing"" is how every relapse starts. But if you can make it past the first three weeks, something shifts. You stop thinking about it constantly. You stop reaching for your phone every three minutes.

So first of all, a short disclaimer, this was NOT vibe-coded, but built with AI, my entire process is this was to learn JavaScript and understand the way it works.  
So I limited the AI to Vanilla JavaScript only so I wont get lost in the process with the overwhelming amount of packages that JS has, and I used it more to ask questions such as ""Why am I getting this error \[error code / console output\] and what should be done o fix it?"" or ""I see I have a problem with the Syntax on line 72, but it looks ok to me. Can you explain to me what is wrong and show me the reason for the syntax error and ways to avoid this kind of syntax oversight in he future?""

  
I limited the AI to answer my questions without changing any code in the codebase.  
I know that adding other plugins or libraries could have created a better product but I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.

So I finally took the plunge and created a GitHub account for my Reddit user, KineticEnforcer. This is meant to be my public GitHub presence. For obvious privacy reasons, I cannot link my work GitHub account to my Reddit account, but the username was available, so I grabbed it and decided it was time to start sharing things openly.

I have always wanted a simple, easy, right to the point knowledge base system that I can just make work without friction and without extra features that I will never use. Projects like mkdocs or mdBook are truly awesome, clearly built with thousands of hours of work behind them, and they deliver exactly what they promise. That said, I personally wanted something much simpler, easier to reason about, and without layers of features I would not touch.

I wanted to see if I could build my own solution that stays minimal and practical. My original goal was very specific. I wanted to run it as a local knowledge base on a Raspberry Pi 2 W and be able to edit Markdown files directly on the system, on the fly, without a complicated setup. That idea became the foundation of this project. After many days and hours digging through the Node.js documentation and MDN, an unreasonable number of coffee mugs, and possibly two JavaScript infused meltdowns because JavaScript is the only language where \[\] == !\[\] is true and so is your decision to rage quit and become a farmer, MarkStack slowly came together.

The first project I pushed is called MarkStack:  
[https://github.com/KineticEnforcer/MarkStack](https://github.com/KineticEnforcer/MarkStack)

There is also a live demo available here:  
[https://markstack.app](https://markstack.app)

This is a project I have been working on for quite a while. The goal was to build a clean, practical Markdown focused stack that feels simple to use but still powerful, especially for people who live in text files, terminals, and GitHub. I tried to keep things readable, predictable, and easy to extend rather than overly clever.

I want to be upfront and say that I am not a professional developer. I learn by reading the manual, experimenting, breaking things, and fixing them. For me, learning to code is much more than just typing code. It is about understanding what the expected output should be, why something behaves the way it does, and how design choices affect usability and maintainability.

Along the way, I did get help from other developers here. That included small bug fixes, pointing out issues that could show up later if the code structure was not adjusted, and reinforcing the importance of comments and proper documentation. Those contributions genuinely made the project better, and I learned a lot from them.

I would really appreciate any feedback you are willing to share, especially around ease of use, structure, documentation, and whether the project makes sense from a fresh set of eyes. If something feels confusing, awkward, or unnecessary, I would honestly like to know.

If you have suggestions or ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a PR. I would truly love that and I am very open to collaboration and learning from others.

1qkmwp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/1qkmwp3/business_idea_is_this_a_viable_offline_marketing/,Business Idea - Is this a viable offline marketing channel for larger brands?,"Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive – coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** – just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters – or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

Brutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.

Short, Intense Relationship and Sudden Breakup","I met a girl on TikTok. We both had the same interests, and it was extremely easy to talk to her. After only one week of contact, she asked me if I wanted to start a relationship with her. I had never met her in real life at that point. I said yes because I thought she was the right one.

For our first meeting, she drove from another city to see me and immediately hugged and kissed me. We went for a coffee, took a walk, talked a lot, and it was really very nice.

For the second meeting, I drove to her place, and it was nice again. We were sitting in the car, she kissed me, and she wanted to sleep with me. I have had many one-night stands in my life, and I thought to myself: no, she is perfect, and you won’t sleep with her. If you do sleep with her, it should be something special. Because of that, I agreed to let her satisfy me orally.

All the other meetings were similar. She was extremely sexual but also very loving. She constantly gave me gifts, texted me regularly, and called me often.

At some point, small conflicts started. For example, after a while she began dressing very revealingly, and I told her that it made me feel uncomfortable, but that I would not forbid her from doing it. She said that her ex had told her how to dress and that she would never let anyone tell her what to do again.

After that, she suddenly started telling me about her trauma. Ex number one had beaten her, ex number two had cheated on her (which is actually true), and ex number three had apparently lied to her. Her father was an alcoholic, and she often had to run away because she was afraid. She also talked constantly about getting married and how much she wanted to be a mother.

Our first conflict was about her best friend. About a year ago, she met a girl and became extremely emotionally dependent on her. This girl was taking advantage of her, and I told my ex-girlfriend that she shouldn’t let herself be used. She became so angry about this that things turned cold between us.

After some time, the conflict was resolved, but then the next one came. We shared our locations via Life360, and she drove to the lake around midnight and stopped replying to me. I told her that I was worried and asked her to please go home. She insulted me and became extremely aggressive.

I told her that I would not allow myself to be treated so disrespectfully and that she should think about how she was treating me.

After that, we talked again, but she was extremely cold. She still texted me, but irregularly, and always said she had to leave. She also replied only with one word most of the time. I asked her why she was doing this and whether she loved me. She said that she did love me, but that she could no longer give me 100%, and that she was tired and stressed.

I told her that I was not interested in a relationship if she was not sure about me. It affected me a lot how cold she became, and I felt like I was losing myself.

I suggested a breakup, and she said, “Yes, it’s better if we break up. It was a short but intense love story.”

Two weeks later, she met someone new and reposted things on TikTok about how deeply in love she was. I had always paid for everything, and in her reposts she said that she didn’t want someone who is rich.

She did not want a final clarifying conversation. I did some research and now I’m wondering whether she had BPD.",1,1769162438.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False

Just gave birth to my first baby almost 8 months ago. I was living an unhealthy lifestyle before becoming pregnant and weighed about 120-130lbs. At the end of my pregnancy I was about 180 and right after birth 160, since then I’ve gained 20+lbs in 8 months. So basically I’m 40-60lbs overweight. My goal is to be around 130lbs. I’m 5’7”. 

I’m really struggling with food addiction. I have a very dopamine seeking personality. Before becoming pregnant I drank alcohol, smoked weed and vaped and drank lots of coffee almost daily. I also took stimulants for ADHD which also helped me not eat very much. Food was never my thing before because I had all these others other substances giving me my dopamine fix each day. 

Well, when I found out I was pregnant I cut all of that cold turkey even coffee. But it switched to food. I did pretty good during pregnancy and managed to stay very small for a long time. I heavily prioritized eating very healthy for gestation and I found it relatively manageable because I had a good routine going. I had 2 months off work before I gave birth and during that time became more sedentary and started eating a lot more and eating more unhealthy/fast food. So I packed on the weight quite quickly. Then after I gave birth I got even more depressed and started eating a pint of ice cream every day. I finally quit the ice cream I couple months ago but I still eat so much. I don’t know exactly how many calories because I don’t count but if I had to guessI would say probably 3000 to 4000 a day which is obviously way too much and why I continue to gain weight. Also, most of that is probably carbs and fat. I do eat a decent amount of protein most days but I also love butter and I’ve been eating way too much bread and other carbs and sugar. I have a huge sweet tooth. Constant cravings. Oh I should also mention that I am pretty sedentary. I’ve never been a particularly active or sporty person, I dread the idea of working out. I do go for walks occasionally with a friend for 1 to 3 hours long and when I do walk consistently, I do find that my weight does not go up, but if my friend is not available to walk, which sometimes we go days or weeks in between walks, then I don’t have motivation to do it.

Anyways the point is I need to do something drastic to lose weight. I’ve never really dieted before and I’ve never eaten super clean or healthy so I have no willpower or self control so I feel like going keto is my only hope. I also am not a great cook and struggle pretty bad with motivation and mental health so any extra tasks such as meal prep cooking and the cleaning associated as well as grocery shopping seems like an impossible task at this point. The only reason why I survive is because I live with my parents and they do basically everything for me  (as devastatingly sad that is to admit ) Keto will be hard too, but at least I know I just can’t have it at all versus having some and then not being able to stop. 

I’m still exclusively breast-feeding and that’s very important to me. I have a decent milk supply and have not had any problems breast-feeding thus far. I really need to make a huge change in my diet, but I’m terrified that my milk will be affected. I haven’t really started my daughter on much for solids yet because I don’t have the focus or motivation and I have built it up to be this scary hard thing in my head. So she relies on my milk. And ideally, I would want to feed her until the age of 1 at the very least but hopefully 2. I will be working on expanding solids situation, but I don’t know what I would do if my milk tanked.

I’m a 27M currently in an arranged marriage process and our engagement is already done.

Her parents are very strict and don’t allow us to talk on calls or communicate freely. Because of that, I first messaged her on LinkedIn and now we talk on Instagram. We’ve met a couple of times, once for coffee near her office and once we spent almost a full day together with a movie and dinner.

She’s 23F and the eldest daughter among four sisters, so she seems quite mature and responsible.

About me, I’ve been single since birth (no girlfriend ever 😅) and I’m an introvert. I don’t really have experience with relationships or regular communication. I struggle with talking on calls or even in person, and many times I don’t know what to talk about daily, either on chat or calls.

She is more of an extrovert and very comfortable expressing herself, which sometimes makes the difference more obvious and makes me feel awkward.

Lately, I’ve been feeling confused. Sometimes she comes across as a bit controlling, but I’m not sure if that’s actually controlling behavior or just her maturity, expectations, or my own inexperience. I don’t want to judge too quickly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags if there are any.

After a previous post and a lot of reading here I’ve ordered a Delonghi Dedica Style after coming across a great offer for it at £120 (was £180 most places which was a bit more than budgeted initially). Usage will be a 3-4 times a week.

At this stage I won’t be getting an aftermarket basket until I’ve experimented a bit but likely intend to get an unpressurised one at some point (I didn’t even know what that was until 2 days ago, progress!)

What I clearly understand from everyone here is I need a decent grinder. I’m happy with a manual given the cost and space I have. 

I’m looking at one or the other of these. Availability of versions seems a bit odd but I found places to get both. If other versions are better and available, then open to suggestion 

Kingrinder K6 (£100)

Kingrinder P2 (£40)

At my very amateur beginner level, am I realistically going to make a noticeable difference to my espresso going for the budget option? 

Bonus question please:

I have some pre-ground coffee (I know, I know!) already for my mokka pot. As this is a coarser grind now, could I put this back in my new grinder of choice to make finer? 

I was thinking of doing this to practice grinding and making some practice shots, to work on technique, get used to the kit etc and also to minimise wastage of what I already have.

1qkmu3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1qkmu3s/should_i_go_keto_while_breastfeeding/,Should I go keto while breastfeeding?,"Should I go keto while breastfeeding?

Just gave birth to my first baby almost 8 months ago. I was living an unhealthy lifestyle before becoming pregnant and weighed about 120-130lbs. At the end of my pregnancy I was about 180 and right after birth 160, since then I’ve gained 20+lbs in 8 months. So basically I’m 40-60lbs overweight. My goal is to be around 130lbs. I’m 5’7”. 

I’m really struggling with food addiction. I have a very dopamine seeking personality. Before becoming pregnant I drank alcohol, smoked weed and vaped and drank lots of coffee almost daily. I also took stimulants for ADHD which also helped me not eat very much. Food was never my thing before because I had all these others other substances giving me my dopamine fix each day. 

Well, when I found out I was pregnant I cut all of that cold turkey even coffee. But it switched to food. I did pretty good during pregnancy and managed to stay very small for a long time. I heavily prioritized eating very healthy for gestation and I found it relatively manageable because I had a good routine going. I had 2 months off work before I gave birth and during that time became more sedentary and started eating a lot more and eating more unhealthy/fast food. So I packed on the weight quite quickly. Then after I gave birth I got even more depressed and started eating a pint of ice cream every day. I finally quit the ice cream I couple months ago but I still eat so much. I don’t know exactly how many calories because I don’t count but if I had to guessI would say probably 3000 to 4000 a day which is obviously way too much and why I continue to gain weight. Also, most of that is probably carbs and fat. I do eat a decent amount of protein most days but I also love butter and I’ve been eating way too much bread and other carbs and sugar. I have a huge sweet tooth. Constant cravings. Oh I should also mention that I am pretty sedentary. I’ve never been a particularly active or sporty person, I dread the idea of working out. I do go for walks occasionally with a friend for 1 to 3 hours long and when I do walk consistently, I do find that my weight does not go up, but if my friend is not available to walk, which sometimes we go days or weeks in between walks, then I don’t have motivation to do it.

Anyways the point is I need to do something drastic to lose weight. I’ve never really dieted before and I’ve never eaten super clean or healthy so I have no willpower or self control so I feel like going keto is my only hope. I also am not a great cook and struggle pretty bad with motivation and mental health so any extra tasks such as meal prep cooking and the cleaning associated as well as grocery shopping seems like an impossible task at this point. The only reason why I survive is because I live with my parents and they do basically everything for me  (as devastatingly sad that is to admit ) Keto will be hard too, but at least I know I just can’t have it at all versus having some and then not being able to stop. 

I’m still exclusively breast-feeding and that’s very important to me. I have a decent milk supply and have not had any problems breast-feeding thus far. I really need to make a huge change in my diet, but I’m terrified that my milk will be affected. I haven’t really started my daughter on much for solids yet because I don’t have the focus or motivation and I have built it up to be this scary hard thing in my head. So she relies on my milk. And ideally, I would want to feed her until the age of 1 at the very least but hopefully 2. I will be working on expanding solids situation, but I don’t know what I would do if my milk tanked. 

I’m finding really conflicting messages about the topic online. I just don’t know what I should do. Does anyone have any experience or advice? Thanks 💜",2,1769162276.0,keto,3,1.0,False

We all moved to a newly built tract, so all new neighbors. I used to take bottles of wine to everyone and make it clear that we were open to helping—like grabbing packages or dogs left outside. Everything went smoothly the first year—it was just me and two neighbors, Ashley and Sarah Ann. Then we added Rebecca about a year later. Around that time, we also met Jessica. Most of us have kids, but the closest in age are Rebecca, Jessica, and me (D). Rebecca also has an adult daughter, Mary, who joins later. Keep her in mind.

So… the implosion.

When Mary and Ashley first meet, it’s around the same time as Rebecca and Mary’s birthdays. I planned a brunch with balloons and cake because I’m intentional like that. Mary said she already had plans, so I offered help anyway and created a group chat to coordinate. Ashley and Mary said they would organize and plan everything and let us know “if” they needed help. I got no replies. The day before, I check in with Jessica because I’m concerned about timing. She texts the group chat asking what the plan is. Mary finally tells us a time. No one else takes charge, or actually has anything truly planned. so Jessica and I do take charge it ends up costing us over $400. Later, Ashley says I tried to “take over” the event. But we had to step in because nothing was planned. That was the first event. For context, Jessica is being iced out because some of them don’t like her, but it was her and me who planned Rebecca’s birthday.

Fast forward: January birthdays. Jessica’s is first, mine is two days later. I kept checking if anyone was planning anything for Jessica….no answers. So I planned a small brunch with balloons and coffee. On the same day, Rebecca and Ashley plan a brunch for my birthday…ON Jessica’s birthday and last-minute invite her. They say it’s “also for her” but blame my husband for not coordinating. Even though none of them text the husband.they didn’t even contact Jessica’s husband until the day of. I was upset. it felt disrespectful and poorly planned.

Now, today… another bomb.

I’m a first responder who had a life-altering event. I am now disabled, not working, and recently had spine surgery. These neighbors know all this. I don’t drink, I’m often sick, I recently was in a car accident totaling my car. they know all this. But somehow I end up in a “situation.”

Sarah Ann’s birthday is coming up. I let the group know early I was planning something like I did for Jessica: balloons and breakfast. This time, I wanted a heart-shaped cake (Google it if you don’t know 🤣). Rebecca and Ashley say they want to help, disagree about the cake, and Rebecca says she’ll get the cake Monday. I agree since now it’s a group thing. I asked Rebecca three times, no action. Wednesday, I ask again. She says she’ll go Thursday, less than 24 hours before Sarah Ann’s birthday. Sarah Ann is young, freshly married, busy, often not home. I had already confirmed she’d be home in the morning.

So I order the cake myself. I tell Rebecca with a heart emoji. She texts back: “WHY? You know I was going to get that.” I explain I was stressed and wanted it perfect because Sarah Ann has always been thoughtful to me. I admit I got upset because I had communicated repeatedly and nothing happened. They’re both “type A” and I’m disabled, but that’s no excuse for ignoring plans.

Then they try to change the time to suit themselves, not Sarah Ann. I’m the one who ordered everything. I said if it’s “from all of us,” why does it matter? Ashley says we all have lives and work. I’m disabled, so apparently I have no life 🤣. I just wanted a scheduled, thoughtful plan. They didn’t check if Sarah Ann would be home later, didn’t communicate anything, and iced out Jessica again.

They also say I’m “defensive” and “make everything about myself.” I’m not offended easily—I just don’t like disrespect or people ignoring agreed plans. I apologized for losing my cool, but Reddit… I just feel like this keeps repeating and I end up in the middle.

So, AITA here? Am I really the one making myself the victim, or are they just being inconsiderate and clicky? If you need more I can share more….",3,1769161896.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Our shared experience has led us to a common solution: coworking spaces. This guide describes how we make the most of coworking spaces in Bahrain, turning them from simple shared offices into vibrant ecosystems that advance our businesses.\
\
It is essential that we understand the distinctive features of Bahrain's coworking scene before we get into the practicalities. Bahrain's coworking scene is still developing, offering a sophisticated mix of foreign franchises and locally developed projects, in contrast to some bigger, more established global hubs.

\
More flexible and agile work arrangements are gradually replacing the traditional nine to five, fixed-desk model. For us, coworking spaces are the tangible expression of this development. They are more than just rented workstations; they are hubs for networking, innovation labs, and startup incubators. They are essential infrastructure in a rapidly digitizing economy, in our opinion. major companies in the Bahraini market.\
\
A variety of providers are present when we take into account the options. International brands that provide a standardized, globally recognized experience, such as Regus and Servcorp, are frequently attractive to companies that need a well-known operational framework. At the same time, regional initiatives like Capital Club Bahrain, Bahrain Financial Harbour (BFH) Business Center, and WorkSmart offer a more customized, community-focused strategy. Depending on our particular needs for amenities, community, & location, we discover that each offers unique benefits.\

A startup, for example, might favor the lively, team-oriented environment of a local location, whereas a multinational consulting firm might favor the polished appearance & large meeting spaces of an international provider.

This focus helps us choose a location that maximizes access to pertinent stakeholders and reduces commute times. But it also means there are fewer options outside of these strategic locations, which is something we always take into account when determining our operational footprint. Selecting a coworking space requires a thorough understanding of our needs, much like a custom tailoring experience. We view this as a strategic investment in our development and productivity rather than a transactional choice.\
\
Determining Our Operational Needs. We all sit down and discuss our non-negotiable needs before we even start browsing. These frequently consist of the following. Desk Type: For our mobile work styles, is a flexible hot-desking option adequate, or do we need a dedicated desk that serves as our permanent base? The former provides stability, while the latter offers agility.\
\
Office Size & Privacy: Do teams need a private office or can they work well in an open-plan setting? We balance the advantages of impromptu teamwork against the requirement for concentrated, uninterrupted work. Meeting Room Access: How often do we think we'll need meeting rooms for team brainstorming, client presentations, or video conferences?\
\
We frequently place a high value on having plenty of readily available meeting spaces. Internet connectivity: In the hyperconnected world of today, dependable, fast internet is a basic necessity rather than a luxury. Spaces with redundant systems and strong infrastructure are given priority. Operating Hours: Do our work schedules coincide with regular business hours, or do we need round-the-clock access to account for time zone differences or late-night creative outbursts? Budgetary Restrictions: We work within predetermined financial bounds.\
\
Coworking spaces come in a variety of price points, so we can effectively narrow down our options by clearly defining our budget up front. We examine what is included and what might result in extra fees, not just the headline price. assessing services & amenities. We understand that the ancillary services and facilities provided by a coworking space can greatly improve our overall experience and productivity, even beyond the basic workspace.\
\
Our professional engine runs smoothly because of these lubricants. Reception Services: A professional reception can be very helpful for meeting and greeting customers, managing mail, & taking phone calls for companies without a full-time administrative staff. We consider this to be an expansion of our own brand. Printing and Scanning Facilities: Having access to dependable equipment for printing, scanning, and copying is a practical requirement that is frequently overlooked until it is required.\
\
Kitchen Facilities: Our comfort and capacity to stay focused throughout the day are greatly enhanced by a well-stocked kitchen with tea, coffee, and occasionally even small snacks. It's not just about food; it's also about casual conversations and short breaks. Community Events and Networking Opportunities: Through planned events, seminars, and get-togethers, some places actively promote a feeling of community. These, in our opinion, are ideal for lead generation, professional development, and coincidental partnerships. This is frequently where the magic occurs, turning a group of people into a network that works together harmoniously.\
\
IT Support: Although we frequently take care of our own basic IT requirements, on-site IT support can be extremely helpful when troubleshooting network problems or setting up equipment. Parking: In Bahrain, where owning a private vehicle is widespread, having access to sufficient parking is frequently essential for both our clients and ourselves. Accessibility and proximity. We make strategic decisions based on practicality rather than just address prestige. We take into account.\
\
Commute Time: We try to reduce the amount of time we spend traveling each day because we know that time spent stuck in traffic is time lost from working efficiently. Access to Public Transportation: Despite being less developed than in some global cities, we still evaluate the area's proximity to bus routes or upcoming transit developments. Access to Supporting Infrastructure: We take into account the entire ecosystem surrounding the coworking space. Are there good restaurants close by for client lunches or quick bites?\
\
Are banks, postal services, and other necessary amenities easily accessible? The next critical step is to actively become a part of the coworking space we have chosen. We are aware that a coworking space's real worth lies in the community & the opportunities it offers, not just the actual desk. making the most of networking opportunities. We see coworking spaces as an organic hub for networking.\
\
We actively look for opportunities to interact with other members. Taking Part in Events: A lot of places regularly host social events, workshops, and meetups. We make it a point to attend these because of the casual interactions they foster as well as the content. We frequently discover possible partnerships or gain insightful knowledge from the experiences of others in these informal contexts.\
\
Participating in Common Areas: The common kitchen, living rooms, and even hallways serve as spontaneous gathering places rather than just transit areas. We push ourselves to be friendly, start conversations, and find out about our neighbors' endeavors. A cordial welcome can frequently develop into a productive business relationship.\
\
Using Online Portals & Communication Channels: A lot of coworking spaces keep Slack channels, online forums, or member-only apps. We actively participate in these platforms by asking questions, sharing our knowledge, and helping others. The physical community is strengthened by these digital extensions. Setting Professional Limits.\
\
While creating a collaborative environment is crucial, we also understand how important it is to uphold professional boundaries. A deliberate effort in this area is required due to the open-plan layout of many coworking spaces. Using Meeting Rooms: We frequently use the available meeting rooms or phone booths for private calls, delicate conversations, or intense focus work.\
\
This keeps others from being disturbed & guarantees privacy. Headphone Etiquette: The phrase ""do not disturb"" is universally represented by headphones. When intense focus is needed, we respect this visual cue from others and use it ourselves. Mindful Communication: We pay attention to how loud we are during calls and conversations in public spaces. Recognizing that our workspace is shared, we strive to be present without being invasive.\
\
making use of services & assistance. Our goal is to get the most out of the extensive support systems that are frequently included in coworking spaces. Administrative Support: We make use of administrative services when they are available for things like basic secretarial work, call forwarding, and mail handling.\
\
As a result, we can concentrate on our core skills. IT Support: We don't hesitate to contact the on-site IT support for any technical issues, which saves us a great deal of time & frustration. Mentorship and Advisory Services: Some coworking spaces, especially those that cater to startups, provide access to advisors or mentorship programs. We actively look for and take advantage of these opportunities because we recognize the value of outside viewpoints.\
\
Our experience with coworking in Bahrain has revealed a number of useful factors & best practices that, in our opinion, are necessary for a seamless and effective experience. Systems for reservations and booking. We become well-versed in the systems for making reservations for private offices, meeting spaces, and other shared resources. Our ability to efficiently plan our schedules and that of our fellow members is ensured by prompt & thoughtful booking procedures. The booking system, in our opinion, acts as a traffic controller, preserving order in a shared setting.\
\
Safeguarding Our Property. Although coworking spaces are generally safe, we always exercise caution. We don't leave valuables unattended, especially in public places.\
\
When lockers are available, people frequently use them to protect their personal belongings. Whether it's a hot desk or dedicated workspace, our personal workspace is viewed as a temporary base rather than a safe haven. respecting etiquette and house rules.\
\
Every coworking space has a set of house rules that are intended to provide a peaceful atmosphere for all participants. These rules are carefully examined and followed. This covers waste disposal, kitchen hygiene, noise levels, and guest policies. We are aware that our behavior affects the atmosphere as a whole, and it is crucial to treat people with respect. We see these guidelines as the coworking community's unspoken social contract.\
\
Accepting Adaptability and Flexibility. Flexibility is what coworking is all about. We approach our engagement with a flexible mindset, knowing that facilities may change, new members may join, & the environment may change.\
\
This mental flexibility enables us to continue making good use of the space while navigating any changes with ease. Coworking, in our opinion, is not a static office but rather a dynamic, living thing. Using Technology to Increase Productivity. We use technology to increase coworking's advantages beyond its physical location. Cloud-Based Collaboration Tools: Our digital extensions, such as Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Slack, allow us to easily collaborate with our teams, whether they are located in the same building or around the world.\
\
Noise-cancelling headphones: As previously stated, these are essential devices for staying focused in an open-plan setting and, when necessary, creating a private audio haven. Mobile Hotspots: Although places usually offer dependable Wi-Fi, having a backup mobile hotspot offers an extra degree of protection against internet outages, guaranteeing continuous connectivity. We have all had nothing but positive experiences with coworking spaces in Bahrain. We have discovered that they are more than just places to work; they are vibrant ecosystems that support professionals and entrepreneurs & encourage creativity and teamwork. We have turned these shared spaces into potent catalysts for our individual and group development by comprehending the terrain, carefully determining our needs, actively participating in the community, and following best practices.\
\
For us, coworking in Bahrain is more than just a fad; it's a calculated way to work more effectively, make deeper connections, & accomplish more in the Kingdom. It serves as the solid trellis that our aspirations can climb upon, where our ideas find fertile ground & our professional networks thrive. .\

If you read my previous post you know that I haven’t had sleep paralysis or lucid dreams since I had my first encounter with the witch. Each subsequent encounter was in the waking world but under the influence of drugs like LSD, Ketamine, 2CB, and more.

But last night was different. I’ve been sober since 2021 and yet, she stood before me, fully materialised for the first time.

“Thank you.” She said softly. Her voice was gentle and mature. Her delicate voice was a shock to my system. I had only ever heard her screeching at me. 

“y-you…” I stuttered. 

“You’ve finally stopped running,” she finished.

I tried to stand, but the room felt thin. The walls were shedding their color, the paint curling back like scorched skin. She, however, was sharpening. Every wrinkle in her dress, every pore on her face was becoming hyper-defined, more real than the air I was breathing.

“What are you?” I stammered.

She pointed to the mirror on the back of the door. I looked and the room behind me was gone, replaced by a grey void. Only she had a reflection.

“The bridge,” she whispered, her voice a dry rustle.

She reached out, her fingers brushing the pulse point on my neck. I felt a terrifying sensation of drainage. It was as if I were a reservoir and she was the drought. The more she touched me, the more the smell of the room, the coffee from this morning, the scent of my laundry, transferred to her.

“You thinned the soil,” she murmured, her eyes tracking a fly buzzing near the ceiling. She watched it with a primal hunger. “But the silence let the roots take hold.”

She stepped into the space I occupied.

“You were the anchor,” she breathed into my ear. I could feel her teeth graze my skin. “Now, you are the wake.”

She walked toward the door, her gait gaining a weight and a confidence I had never possessed. She paused at the handle, her hand lingering on the brass as if tasting the sensation of cold metal for the first time.

1qkmmas,https://youtu.be/-fg0v6OMIAA,4 Very Scary TRUE Border Town Motel Horror Stories,"# ""ROOM 12"":

I drove up to the dusty parking lot of the old motel on the outskirts of Laredo, right near the river that marks the border. The sign flickered with half its lights out, reading ""Rio View Motel"" in faded red letters. I needed a room after a long day on the road, hauling supplies for my small shop back home. The place looked empty, with only a couple of trucks parked far apart.

The clerk behind the counter was an older man with a mustache, wiping his glasses when I walked in. ""Evening,"" he said, not looking up right away. ""You need a room?""

""Yes, just for one night,"" I replied, sliding my ID across the desk. ""Quiet here, huh?""

He nodded slowly, stamping the key card. ""Most folks don't stop in Laredo unless they have to. Border town's got its own rhythm. Forty bucks, cash only.""

I paid and asked, ""Any good places to grab a bite nearby? I'm starving.""

""There's a diner down the block,"" he said, handing me the key to room 12. ""But watch yourself out there. We've had some women go missing lately. Cops say it's nothing, but you hear things.""

His words stuck with me as I headed to my room. The hallway smelled like old carpet and faint smoke. I unlocked the door and flipped on the light, revealing a bed with a thin blanket, a small TV, and a window facing the empty lot. I dropped my bag and decided to walk to that diner before it got too late.

At the diner, a few locals sat at the counter, nursing coffees. I ordered a burger and sat in a booth. A woman in her thirties, with tired eyes, slid into the seat across from me. ""Mind if I join? Name's Rosa. You new around here?""

""Sure,"" I said, surprised. ""I'm Anna. Just passing through.""

She leaned in, lowering her voice. ""You staying at the Rio View? Be careful. My friend Melissa hasn't been seen in over a week. She worked odd jobs, met people at places like that. Last I heard, she got in a truck with some guy in uniform.""

""Uniform?"" I asked, taking a bite.

""Yeah, like border patrol. They drive around a lot. Nice at first, but who knows? Claudine, another girl I know, she argued with someone like that and now she's gone too. Hospital said she got shot, but died before talking.""

I felt uneasy, but tried to brush it off. ""Probably just rumors. Towns like this have stories.""

Rosa shook her head. ""Not rumors. I saw the news. Two bodies found out on the rural roads, shot up close. And more might be out there. Stay in your room tonight, Anna.""

We talked a bit more, about how the town felt forgotten, with the border traffic bringing in strangers all the time. She left after her coffee, saying, ""Lock your door tight.""

Back at the motel, the lot was darker, with only one streetlamp buzzing overhead. I noticed a white truck parked near my room, engine off. A man stepped out, tall, in a green uniform with patches. He looked my way and smiled politely. ""Evening, ma'am. Everything alright?""

I nodded, key in hand. ""Yes, just heading in.""

""I'm David,"" he said, walking closer. ""I work border patrol. Saw you walking back. This area's not the safest after dark. Want me to check your room? We get reports of break-ins sometimes.""

His offer seemed kind, but something in his eyes made me pause. They were too steady, too focused. ""No, thanks. I'm fine.""

He shrugged. ""Suit yourself. But if you hear anything, my truck's right here. I patrol these motels a lot.""

Inside, I locked the door and chained it, peeking through the curtain. He stood by his truck for a minute, then drove off slowly. I tried to sleep, but every creak in the building kept me awake. The walls were thin; I could hear distant cars on the highway, and once, what sounded like a door slamming far away.

Around midnight, a knock came at my door. I sat up, listening. Another knock, softer. ""Who is it?"" I called.

""It's David, from earlier. I found something outside your window. You might want to see.""

My mind raced. What could it be? I didn't open the door. ""What is it?""

""Just open up. It's important.""

I looked through the peephole. He was there, uniform neat, but holding something in his hand—a phone, maybe. ""I can call the clerk,"" I said.

""No need,"" he replied, voice calm. ""I talked to him already. There's been another incident nearby. A woman like you, alone. I can drive you to a safer spot if you want.""

Rosa's words echoed in my head—women going missing, getting in trucks with guys like him. I backed away from the door. ""I'm okay. Thanks anyway.""

He knocked again, harder. ""Open the door, Anna. I know you're scared, but I'm here to help.""

How did he know my name? I hadn't told him. Maybe the clerk mentioned it. I grabbed my phone, dialing the front desk. No answer. The knocking stopped, and I heard footsteps fading.

I waited, sitting on the bed with the light off. Minutes passed, then an hour. Just when I thought he was gone, I heard scratching at the window. The curtain moved slightly. I held my breath, phone ready to call police.

Then, a whisper through the glass: ""Anna, I saw you talking to Rosa. She talks too much. Like the others.""

My blood ran cold. What others? Melissa? Claudine? I dialed 911 quietly, whispering my location and the situation. ""There's a man outside my room, border patrol uniform. He knows things he shouldn't.""

The operator said, ""Stay put. Units are on the way.""

Outside, the scratching stopped. I peeked—his truck was still there, but empty. Where was he? I heard a car door somewhere else in the lot.

Suddenly, the power flickered, and the room went dark. The motel was old; maybe a breaker. But it felt wrong. I crouched by the bed, listening.

Footsteps again, this time at the door. The handle jiggled. ""I can get in if I want,"" his voice said, low and even. ""But I'd rather you come out. We can talk in my truck. It's quiet out on the roads.""

No way. I clutched a lamp as a weapon. Sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder. The jiggling stopped. Through the window, I saw him run to his truck, start it, and speed off.

Police arrived moments later, lights flashing. I opened the door to two officers, a man and a woman. ""He was here,"" I told them, describing David, the uniform, the threats.

The woman officer nodded. ""We've had reports. Missing women, bodies found shot on those empty highways. Sounds like the same guy. You did right not opening up.""

They searched the lot, found nothing. But later that night, on the news in my room—power back on—they reported a chase. A border patrol agent named David, hiding in a hotel garage downtown, arrested after a woman escaped his truck earlier that day. He confessed to killing four women, all shot in desolate spots outside town. He hated certain types, picked them up, drove them out, and ended them.

I shook as I watched. If I had opened that door, or gotten in his truck, I might have been next. The motel clerk came by later, apologetic. ""I shouldn't have told him your name. He asked, said he was checking on safety.""

Rosa called me the next day—I'd given her my number at the diner. ""You okay? I saw the news. That was him, wasn't it?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Thanks for the warning. It saved me.""

She sighed. ""This town... it looks empty, but danger hides in the uniforms sometimes. Drive safe, Anna.""

I left Laredo at dawn, the border bridge in my rearview. But I'll always check twice before trusting a stranger in a quiet place like that.





# ""LOOSE END"":

I checked into the dusty motel off the main road in Arivaca, a tiny spot in Arizona close to the line with Mexico. The sign out front said ""Desert Rest Inn,"" but half the letters were missing. I was on a road trip from Phoenix, stopping for the night before heading further south. The clerk, a thin man with tired eyes, slid the key across the counter. ""Room 12, end of the row,"" he said. ""Keep your door locked. Folks come and go here.""

The room was plain, with a lumpy bed and a fan that rattled. I dropped my bag and went out to stretch my legs. A few trucks sat in the lot, one with stickers about protecting the border. A woman stood by it, talking on her phone. She had short hair and wore a jacket too warm for the air. ""Yeah, we'll hit it tonight,"" she said low. ""Get the money, clean up the mess."" She saw me and hung up quick, giving a fake smile. ""Lost?"" she asked.

""No, just walking,"" I replied. ""You from around here?""

""Sort of. Name's Anna."" She didn't offer more. Two men joined her, one big with a beard, the other skinny. They nodded at me but kept quiet. I went back inside, but their voices carried through the thin walls. ""The house has drugs, cash from smuggling,"" the big one said. ""We go in as patrol, take what we need."" Anna shushed him. ""Not so loud. That guy next door might hear.""

I sat on the bed, wondering if I should mind my own business. Border areas had stories of smugglers and watchers. But this sounded planned, like a robbery. I peeked out the curtain. They loaded bags into the truck, things that clinked like metal. Guns? My mind raced. I called the front desk. ""Hey, those people outside—seem off?"" The clerk sighed. ""They pay cash, stay quiet. Don't bother them.""

Night came on. I tried to sleep, but footsteps paced outside. A door slammed. Their truck rumbled away. Quiet fell over the motel. Then, hours later, tires crunched gravel. Voices again, hurried. ""It went bad,"" the skinny man whispered. ""The kid saw us. Had to... you know."" Anna snapped, ""Shut up! Get inside."" A thump, like something heavy dropped. I pressed against the wall, listening. ""Blood on my shirt,"" the big one grumbled. ""Wash it quick. And that witness? If anyone asks, we were here all night.""

Witness? Did they mean me? I hadn't seen anything, but maybe they thought I had. My hands shook as I grabbed my phone. No bars—signal was weak out here. I crept to the window. The lot was dark, but light spilled from their room. Shadows moved inside. One looked like a person cleaning a long object, maybe a rifle.

A knock came at my door. Soft at first, then harder. ""Hey, neighbor,"" Anna called. ""You up? Need to borrow a phone charger."" Her voice was too friendly. I stayed still, barely breathing. The knob turned, but the lock held. ""Come on, open up. It's important."" Footsteps circled to my window. A face pressed close, peering in. I ducked behind the bed.

They whispered outside. ""He knows something,"" the skinny one said. ""Saw us loading up."" The big one grunted. ""Handle it quiet. No more messes tonight."" My throat tightened. I looked for a way out—bathroom window, small but maybe I could squeeze. I eased it open, screen popping loose. The drop was short to the dirt behind.

As I climbed out, their door creaked. Footsteps came around the corner. ""There he is!"" Anna hissed. I ran, feet pounding the dry ground toward the road. The motel was isolated, no houses close. Their truck engine roared to life, headlights sweeping. I dove into bushes, thorns scratching my arms.

The truck stopped nearby. Doors opened. ""Come out, we just want to talk,"" the big one called. Flashlights danced over the ground. I held my breath, curled small. The skinny one poked the bushes. ""He's gone. Check the road."" They moved off, but I heard Anna say, ""Can't leave loose ends. Like that family tonight.""

Family? What had they done? I waited, then snuck back toward the motel office. The clerk was inside, watching TV. I banged on the glass. ""Call the police! Those people—they're dangerous!"" He frowned but picked up the phone. ""What happened?""

As he dialed, sirens wailed far off. Maybe someone else had called. The truck sped away, kicking dust. Police arrived fast, lights flashing. They checked the room next to mine—bloodied clothes in the sink, a map with a house circled nearby. ""Looks like a hit,"" one officer said. ""Vigilante style, posing as border agents.""

Turns out, Anna and her group had invaded a home in town, thinking it held smuggler cash. They shot a dad and his little girl, hurt the mom. All for nothing—no drugs there. The mom survived, described them. My tip helped catch them later that week, hiding in another motel up north.

I left Arivaca the next day, but the fear stuck. Motels like that hide folks with dark plans. One wrong room, and you hear things you shouldn't.





# ""ROOM 404"":

I drove across the border into Tijuana late one afternoon, looking for a quiet spot to rest after a long road trip from up in California. The city buzzed with people and cars, but I found this old motel off a side street, away from the main crowds. It had a faded sign that said Cascadas Inn, with rooms that looked worn out from years of use. I just wanted a bed and some peace, so I checked in. The front desk guy, a short man with tired eyes, handed me a key to room 403. ""Be careful out there,"" he said. ""This area gets rough at night.""

I settled into the room, which had thin walls and a small window facing the parking lot. I unpacked my bag and turned on the old TV for some noise. Local news came on, talking about a woman found dead in a hotel not far away. Strangled, they said. Police had no clues yet. I changed the channel, not wanting to think about it.

That evening, I went out for food at a nearby stand. When I came back, I saw a man pulling up in a dark car. He was average build, maybe in his thirties, with short hair and a plain shirt. He parked and went to the desk, then headed to room 404, right next to mine. I nodded as I passed him in the hall. ""Good evening,"" I said.

He looked at me quick. ""Yeah, you too,"" he replied, his voice flat.

Through the wall, I could hear him moving around. Later, around ten, a knock came at his door. A woman's voice: ""Hey, you called? It's me, Angela.""

The door opened. ""Come in,"" he said. ""I got the room ready.""

She laughed a little. ""Okay, but make it quick. I have other plans.""

The door closed. I heard low talking, then quiet. I tried to sleep, but the walls let every sound through. After a while, things got strange. A thump, like something fell. Then a gasp. I sat up, listening. More scuffling, short and sharp. Then nothing.

I waited, but no more noise. Maybe just a fight, I thought. People argue. I lay back down.

The next morning, I woke to sirens outside. Police cars filled the lot. Officers taped off room 404. The desk guy stood there, talking to them. ""She came in last night,"" he said. ""With that guy from California. I saw them on the camera.""

An officer nodded. ""We found her inside. Strangled. No sign of him.""

I stepped out, curious. ""What happened?"" I asked the desk guy.

He shook his head. ""Dead woman in there. Young one. The man left early, crossed back over the border, I bet.""

The news that day showed her picture. Angela Carolina Acosta Flores, they called her. Worked in the area, met clients in hotels. Police said it looked like the same way another woman died a month before, Elizabeth something. Strangled in a different motel nearby.

I decided to stay another night, fix my car tire that went flat. That afternoon, I saw the same man again. Wait, no – couldn't be. But there he was, pulling in with the same car. He glanced around, then went to the desk for another key. Room 406 this time.

""You back?"" the desk guy asked him.

""Just for the night,"" he said. ""Business.""

I watched from my door. Something felt wrong. His eyes darted too much. I went inside, but kept an ear out.

Evening came. Another knock. Different woman. ""You the one who texted? It's Marisol.""

""Yeah, come on in,"" he answered. ""Got cash here.""

She went inside. Talking, laughing at first. Then quiet. I pressed my ear to the wall. A chair moved. Then a choke sound, cut off. Struggle noises, brief. Silence again.

I grabbed my phone, hands shaking a bit. Should I call? What if it's nothing? But the news flashed in my mind. I dialed the local police. ""There's something bad in room 406,"" I whispered. ""Hurry.""

Minutes later, sirens again. But when they knocked, no answer. They broke in. The woman lay on the floor, marks on her neck. Dead. The man was gone, window open to the back lot.

Police questioned everyone. ""You see him?"" an officer asked me.

""Yes,"" I said. ""Tallish, dark car. He was here last night too.""

They checked cameras. ""Matches the guy from the other killings,"" the officer muttered. ""Crosses the border each time. Thinks he's safe.""

I packed up fast, drove back across to San Diego. But later, news updates came. They caught him, Bryant Rivera, in California. He'd killed three women like that, all in Tijuana hotels. Strangled them after luring them in. Crossed back home after each one, like nothing happened.

Police said he confessed, called himself some nickname. But to me, he was just the quiet guy next door, with dead eyes. That motel in the border town hides dark things. People come and go, some never leave. I drive past borders careful now, wondering who's in the next room.





# ""THE SMILE"":

I pulled up to the Desert Edge Motel just outside El Paso, tired from the long drive south. The place looked worn down, with peeling paint on the walls and a flickering sign that promised clean rooms. I was in town to visit my cousin, who lived nearby, and this spot was cheap and close to the highway. I grabbed my suitcase and went to the front desk.

The clerk, a quiet older man with glasses, handed me the key to room 8. ""Quiet night,"" he said. ""Not many guests.""

I nodded and headed to my room. It had a small bed, a table, and a window facing the empty road. I unpacked a few things and called my cousin. ""I'm here,"" I told her. ""Let's meet tomorrow for lunch.""

""Sounds good,"" she replied. ""Be safe. Things are odd around here lately.""

I hung up and lay down, but sleep didn't come easy. Around midnight, I heard a truck pull up outside. Doors slammed, and a man's voice carried through the thin walls. ""Come on, it's not far,"" he said.

A woman's voice answered, soft and unsure. ""Okay, but just for a bit.""

I looked out the window. A tall man with long hair and tattoos stood by a beige pickup. He talked to a young woman in a short skirt. She smiled, but her eyes darted around. They walked toward a room down the way, maybe room 10.

I shook my head and went back to bed. People come and go in motels like this.

The next morning, I went out for coffee. The clerk was sweeping the walkway. ""Did you see that man last night?"" I asked.

He paused. ""Big guy? Yeah, he stays sometimes. Name's David. Rides a motorcycle. Keeps to himself.""

I drove into town and met my cousin at a little cafe. She looked worried. ""A girl went missing last week,"" she said. ""Karen, works as a dancer. Last seen at a motel like yours.""

""Which motel?""

""Hawaiian Royale, but it's similar to yours. Police are asking questions.""

I thought about the man and woman from the night before. ""I saw a guy with a woman at my place.""

My cousin leaned forward. ""Describe him.""

""Tall, long hair, tattoos. Beige truck.""

Her face went pale. ""That sounds like Skeeter. People call him that. He hangs around bars and picks up girls. Be careful.""

I finished my coffee and drove back. The motel seemed even emptier. The beige truck was gone. I asked the clerk if the woman was still there.

""She left early,"" he said. ""With him, I think.""

That afternoon, I walked around the motel grounds. Dust kicked up under my feet. In the distance, the desert stretched out, flat and endless. I saw a police car drive by slowly, but it didn't stop.

Later, as evening came, the truck returned. The man got out alone. He carried a shovel to his room. Why a shovel? I wondered. Maybe for work.

I stayed inside, reading a book. Then, a knock on my door. I opened it a crack. It was him.

""Hey, neighbor,"" he said with a grin. ""Got any cigarettes? Mine ran out.""

I shook my head. ""No, sorry.""

He looked past me into the room. ""Traveling alone?""

""Yes,"" I said, closing the door a bit more.

""Desert's pretty at night. Want to see?""

""No thanks. Good night.""

He walked away, but I locked the door tight. Something about his eyes made me uneasy.

That night, I heard cries from far off, like from the desert. Maybe an animal. I pulled the curtains shut.

In the morning, more police cars arrived. Officers talked to the clerk. I stepped out. ""What's going on?"" I asked one, a woman with a notebook.

""Another missing girl,"" she said. ""Rosa. Last seen with a man in a beige truck.""

I told her about the man next door. ""He had a shovel.""

The officer wrote it down. ""Stay here. We'll check.""

They knocked on his door. No answer. The clerk opened it. Empty, but clothes scattered, and an orange blanket on the bed.

""He's gone,"" the man officer said. ""Truck too.""

I drove to my cousin's house. ""Police are looking for him,"" I told her.

She nodded. ""I heard on the news. Girls vanishing, bodies found in the desert.""

""Bodies?""

""Yes. Shallow graves. Stabbed or strangled.""

I felt sick. Had I seen one of those girls?

Days passed. I extended my stay to help if needed. One evening, a woman came to the motel, looking scared. ""I'm Judy,"" she said to the clerk. ""I need to talk to police.""

I overheard. ""He picked me up,"" she whispered. ""Promised a ride. Took me to the desert. Tied me to his truck. Hurt me. I got away when a car came by.""

The clerk called the officers. They took her statement. ""Matches others,"" the woman officer said. ""He lures them, drives out, kills.""

I gave my details again. ""I saw him with a woman.""

That helped. Soon, news said they arrested David Leonard Wood. He denied it, but evidence piled up: fibers from his blanket on bodies, witnesses like Judy, inmates who heard him brag.

They found six bodies: Ivy, Desiree, Karen, Angelica, Rosa, Dawn. All young, taken to the desert.

I left El Paso soon after. But I think about that motel, the man with the shovel, the cries in the night. How easy it is for danger to hide in plain sight. Now, I always ask about guests, lock doors, avoid strangers offering rides.",1,1769161454.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

So I got tired of the usual ""we should grab a coffee sometime"" that never actually happens, and built something about it.

**Here's how it works:**

You tell us when you're free and what you're into (interests, topics you geek out about, etc.). We send you one meet with another person: time, date, and spot already sorted. You see what you have in common with them. If you both accept, you just... show up. That's it.

Right now it's coffee or drinks, but planning to add walks, ping pong, and other stuff once we get going.

After each meet, we ask for quick feedback so we can get better at suggesting you people you actually vibe with.

**Why I'm posting:**

Looking for some early users in Berlin to test this and tell me what's broken/stupid/missing. If you're down to be part of the early group and help shape this thing, drop a comment or shoot me a DM.

Huwei essentially told him he’s not one of the three people he’s interested in (I thought this part was unnecessary), and that he doesn’t see Hiroya that way.

I don’t know why Hiroya still took Huwei out for the coffee shift at that point.

Then Hiroya acknowledged to Huwei that this interest was one sided, when he was telling Huwei that he was leaving the show for a while.

What I find rather somewhat difficult to understand is how Hiroya subsequently mentioned in the interview/voice over narration while on his way to the airport, that he intends to focus on Huwei when he returns.

Does Hiroya actually think that by leaving the show for a short while and coming back, Huwei’s feelings would reset entirely?

(Or is Hiroya getting plastic surgery that would magically transform his appearance and make Huwei like him? I’m sure that’s not the case; just using this example to demonstrate the absurdity of continuing the chase after his return.)

Some people might know me already as a person behind [Grim Dawn Tools](https://www.grimtools.com), others might have used [Last Epoch Tools](https://www.lastepochtools.com) in the past. If that means something, then you might get the idea what to expect :D 

Today I'm pleased to announce a collection of tools for No Rest for The Wicked! I've spent over a year developing it – it's built based on datamined game data and I intend to keep it up-to-date for years to come. 

&nbsp;

For Figures of Speech prompts, I gave a free parameters, including the word length of 500-1000 words and the prompts for a few of the Fifty mentioned in the series.

I gave the AI creative license and let's just say, they're a long way off from replacing the better writers and I think it just makes it easier to do those lower level tasks and let's leave the creators a slightly higher level of skill to create actual tangible and engaging writing.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Who else tracks their board game collection this closely?,"Over the past year, I realized I am not the gamer I used to be and that I have become more of a board game experience curator. I decided to stop keeping games I don't enjoy playing, no matter how good they are, and started building a library I actually love to look at and experience.

This meant I had to cull 96 decent-to-excellent games, including top-rated BGG titles like *Ark Nova, Spirit Island, A Feast for Odin* and *Dune: Imperium Uprising.*

You might ask why? Because despite the hype, they no longer fit my profile. I didn't feel excited playing them. Many felt too mathy, beige, complex, or fiddly for my taste. Life is too short to spend it on games that do not spark joy.

I prefer high-production, tactile, and thematic experiences (like *Final Girl* or *Massive Darkness*) over mechanically complex and crunchy games. I do keep a few heavier games like *Nemesis* or *Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion*, but only because they are immersive and I love their theme.

Context: a bit of a context: I am a medical doctor (F27) and he is a working law student(M28). we've been together for almost 8 years now and for the longest time we've hit the stable point of our relationship where we dont usually fight. We are independent of each other and have our own careers and at the same time cheating has never been an issue. we trust and respect each other hence we were stable. I've had a bit of falling out in terms of career. I had to quit my job in order to be more accessible to my boyfriend and my family. I love my previous job! I was able to help other people where I get to serve the last, the lost and the least but this passion of mine has it's own cons: It's 5 hours away from my boyfriend and my family. due to the distance I was unable to keep my shit and decided to quit and move back to my hometown. I needed him the most. I heavily relied on him the most. I admit I went from secure to needy girlfriend but he wasnt able to provide that because his schedule revolved around his work and his law school. I get that and I respected the hustle but during our protected time, he would tend to forget to fulfill my emotional needs. I became toxic and became the worst girlfriend within the span of 2 months: needy, not a great communicator, cold and topakin. we frequently argued, I cried in front of him and begged for his attention. We would get back again and then fight after a couple of weeks.We then decided to take a trip out of town for 10 days maybe hoping that we would be able to save our relationship and for me to really reflect on what to do with my career. he took a 7 day off and then did WFH setup for 3 days. initially it was great but I noticed patterns where he would only stare at his phone and didnt mind that we were together. I felt like a complete loser where I would envy other couples seizing the moment, he was just doomscrolling while I wait for him to initiate a conversation. We had 2 big fights during our vacation. partly because he wasnt mindful that I was with him during our out of town trip and me being a not so great of a communicator and giving him the cold shoulder.3 days after the trip I gathered every single ounce of courage to be mature and told him everything in the calmest way possible about him not being mindful. he was blindsided of that conversation and asked to buy time in order to process everything that I've said and then he'll write it thru a letter. Even though that it was unfair for me, I allowed it however I made a mistake of telling him ""if ever makikipag hiwalay ka sakin, please dont do it via letter"" because relationship ending words were never in our vocabulary. from December 24 until January 13 we only have neutral conversations max of 2 chats per day while some days we never talked. I was scared that I was challenging him which I never really wanted in the first place. All I wanted was compromise and respect on our protected relationship time.we met in a random coffee shop in BGC. I chose a neutral conversation so that we were able to hold our shit together. during the hard parts of the convo I felt like he was going to break up even though that he didnt really exactly said the B word. I was gathering every ounce of me to save the relationship asking him to express himself because communication is key in the relationship. He did mentioned that I become cold whenever he did something wrong and he wasnt allowed to express feelings because I would also get mad. I get that and I really reflected that. However after that encounter he was still buying more time to process things. I didnt wanted to buy more time because he already had that during the holiday season but I respected it. I thought that I was gonna go home solo that night but he asked to eat dinner with him before heading home. it was a shock tbh. during dinner I asked him what are the terms and.conditions of the cool off period and he told me that I can still chat him up whenever I needed someone to talk to but expect late replies since he is busy working and it's his prelims week. I respected that and so I thought that I was allowed to still be in contact with him. after that night he rode a taxi and kissed my cheeks. he asked me if I was able to get home safely and we still chatted throughout the night even when he was studying with his schoolmates.the following days I saw how he grew cold. I expected different. it went back to sending 2 messages max per day to none. it was me mostly sending texts and I would expect a reply 10 hours after. it was weird because the night when we talked he was different but he grew cold. on the day of our anniversary, I planned to do something special to surprise him in order to make up for all of my toxicity. he was weird I called him and he told me ""Hindi ko alam ano sasabihin ko sayo kahit na anniversary natin kasi nanghingi ako ng space sayo"" it shattered me into a thousand pieces. I asked if we will be alright after our cool off and he told me ""i hope so"". I ended the call and then never contacted him again and respected the space (Apologies for my grammar and spelling I'm emotionally exhausted and confused as of the moment)

Let's be real. That standalone automatic milk frother is okay, but it's a one-trick pony, right? You're stuck with one type of pod or just grounds, and let's not even talk about hotel coffee. What if you could have cafe-quality lattes and cappuccinos, hot or iced, all from one sleek machine, without breaking the bank? That's where HiBREW steps in, redefining what a coffee machine can do.

The beauty of a HiBREW isn't just its ability to froth; it's the **universal brewing advantage**. Forget being tied to K-Cups or Nespresso. HiBREW machines are designed to be true coffee chameleons, handling everything from your favorite ground beans to multiple pod systems like K-Cup, Nespresso, and Dolce Gusto. Plus, the secret to that perfect microfoam? A powerful **19-bar (or 20-bar on Pro models) extraction pump** that delivers real espresso, not just coffee water. And for the ultimate freedom, the H4 series even rocks a 12V car adapter – hello, amazing coffee on camping trips or trucking across the country!

Here’s why HiBREW is the smarter choice:

*   **Unmatched Pod Freedom:** Brew with K-Cup, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, or your own ground coffee. Say goodbye to pod limitations!
*   **True Espresso Quality:** High-pressure extraction means rich crema and authentic espresso taste every single time.
*   **Hot & Cold Versatility:** Enjoy a piping hot latte or a refreshing iced coffee from the same machine, all with perfectly frothed milk.

Stop settling for mediocre. It's time to elevate your coffee experience and reclaim your counter space. **Explore the HiBREW collection today** and discover the future of home brewing – it’s more versatile, more powerful, and surprisingly affordable.

1qkm10v,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1qkm10v/confession_my_list_of_side_effects/,Confession (+my list of side effects),"This is probably my last post on Reddit since I prefer reading posts to writing them. Hence the wall of text.

After two weeks of no caffeine, I went back to one cup a day, but today I'm quitting again.  
I really loved the ritual of waking up, brewing coffee, and sitting down to read books.  
Or having coffee before the gym.  
Without coffee, the reading process is completely different (as are other activities), and you will get used to it.  
I think the most dangerous thing when quitting is insomnia. That morning when you didn't sleep well and your discipline muscle is weaker than ever.  
On such days, you want to eat something calorie-dense, not to mention having a cup of coffee.

If you're having exactly that kind of morning, know this: that cup of coffee will give you what you want for about 30 minutes. After that, you'll spend the whole day drowsy, anxious, and so on. (You all know the side effects perfectly well.)  
So, are those 30 minutes worth the path you've already walked?  
You know what comes later, you've overcome so much torment, and you want to go back to level zero again?  
I don't think so. Do you?

So here it is.  
I drank a cup of coffee to enjoy a book.  
In one hour, I read 5 pages, ordered 2 pairs of jeans (lol, I don't need jeans), and wrote a rap (I'm not a rapper, haha).  
I didn't do what I intended, my attention scattered, and on top of that, I got the full bouquet of side effects.  
I've quit hundreds of times, and this list is something I consistently notice and am absolutely sure about.

My reaction to coffee after 3 days and one cup a day:

* A thick, dry, lifeless, and old face. I'm 28, and every time I quit, I look like a kid.
* Body aches. My stomach started hurting again, and nausea returned. The same teeth hurt. Old pains (shoulder, knee, etc.) came back at the gym.
* Longer recovery after the gym and more muscle soreness.
* Of course, anxiety returned. Social interactions become terrible. And if there was masturbation that day, I just turn into an omega male mess.
* Shortness of breath.
* Spots/darkening before my eyes. For the first time, I almost blacked out while doing deadlifts.
* My favorite: cold extremities. Even in summer, my friends were shocked by my ice-cold hands. (This affects the penis too—more blood means more size, hehe). I think this should intrigue the male part of this thread :)
* Increased sweating regardless of anxiety.
* Thinking. It's just different.

I could recall more effects, but I'm lazy :)  
Better keep a quote for the day: ""When you realize that the whole world is a reflection of your state and thinking, you understand that no one is holding you back. You are fighting with yourself.""

I wrote this for my future self and as motivation for other people.

P.S. This is a neural network translation, and I hope it interpreted my thoughts well.  
Good luck to everyone!",4,1769159240.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

I am an unknown watercolor artist and emerging autism author/advocate who knew I was autistic for 14 years but hid it to survive. I am coming out now to lead a movement that shoves our talent in the world's face. I am curating an at-cost, coffee table, gallery-quality art book to replace the narrative of ""deficits"" with one of undeniable mastery. I have established and emerging artists on board, but I am open to all: your talent is all that matters.  

Landmark Art Project: Call for Artists

What is this?

I am curating a landmark, first-of-its-kind art book dedicated to the spectacular mastery of autistic women. This is a passion project rooted in our shared dedication to truth, fairness, and equality. I am taking zero profit as the author, editor, or publisher; this is purely for the betterment of ourselves and the world.

The Quality (The Gold Standard)

This will be a Museum-Quality volume designed to stand the test of time:

• 7 x 7 inch square, linen-bound hardcover with a high-gloss dust jacket.

• Full-gloss pages on premium 70 lb paper for maximum color ""pop"" and saturation. Every piece will have its own page for maximum impact.

• Distributed through the same professional channels as major publishing houses (global distribution, Barnes & Noble, libraries, Amazon, and Google).

What you get:

• Spectacular Visibility: Only 10 to 15 artists will be selected, allowing for multiple full pages per artist.

• Own-Voice Space: An opportunity to speak about your art, how it relates to autism, and the perspective behind your pieces. Any marketing links or none. Whether you use this to promote sales or not is up to you. 

• Privacy & Safety: Participation via pseudonym or anonymity is fully supported for those who are not ""out"" or prefer privacy.

Requirements:

• The Talent: Your work must ""scream"" undeniable quality.  Established and emerging artists have already joined, but private artists are welcome.  

• Technical: Once selected, we will sign a simple artist agreement. You will need to provide high-resolution files (professionals at stores like UPS or FedEx can handle the scanning for you).

• Deadline: No fixed deadline. Curation will not be finalized before August at the earliest, with the goal of Holiday Sales availability.

This is our chance to shove our undeniable value in the face of the world.

MARC McKee shed a life-changing nine stone in just 10 months on fat jabs, now revealing the injection spot he believes works instantly.

“I was told clearly that if nothing changed, I might not live to see 40,” the 34-year-old podcast host said.

**At his heaviest Marc tipped the scales at 23.4 stone**Credit: Jam Press

 

**Since 2024, the podcast host has lost nine stone and now weighs 14.7 stone**Credit: Jam Press

At 23.4 stone, doctors had warned Marc, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, that he was suffering from dangerously [high blood pressure](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/5433372/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-hypertension-normal-reading/) and [cholesterol](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/36842303/nutritionist-sky-high-cholesterol-tips/), as well as early signs of damage to his liver, kidneys and heart.

And despite always struggling with his [weight](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/obesity/), this was the first time he “stopped being about weight as a ‘lifestyle’ issue and became about survival.”

He explained: “It was no longer about weight or appearance, it was about whether I was going to live a long, healthy life.”

Around the same time as the doctor’s caution, he became an uncle for the first time, and says holding his nephew “changed something” in him.[](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/37973613/fat-three-rules-lost-9-stone-year/)

Marc said: “It made the consequences of doing nothing feel very real.

“I wanted to be present – I wanted to be here for the long term.

“That moment, combined with the medical warning, pushed me to seek proper, medically supported help rather than continuing cycles of dieting that had failed me for years.”

He decided to start taking [weight loss jabs](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/weight-loss-jabs/), specifically [Mounjaro](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/37972859/mounjaro-killed-cravings-coca-cola-coffee/), becoming one of the first people in the UK to use a GLP1 treatment in August 2024.[](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37994999/obesity-directly-causes-dementia-fat-jabs-could-help/)

Marc has also made a number of lifestyle changes and is receiving ongoing medical support.

Since 2024, Marc has lost nine stone and now weighs 14.7 stone.

He also believes changing where he injected the drug played a key role in his success.

But “more importantly” than the weight loss, Marc says his “health markers have dramatically improved.”

He said: “My blood pressure and cholesterol have normalised, organ function has been restored, and my cardiovascular risk has significantly reduced.”

Marc says he opted for Mounjaro over dieting as that was “not solving the real problem”.

He said: “I had tried everything: structured diets, calorie tracking, gym programmes, and intense periods of discipline.

**He used fat jabs to shed the pounds**

“I could lose weight, but I could not sustain it, and the cycles of losing and regaining left me feeling exhausted and defeated.

“When my health started to decline, I knew I needed medical support, not another plan built on willpower.

“Mounjaro felt like a tool that finally addressed what was happening in my body – appetite regulation, cravings, and constant food noise – rather than treating me like I was simply failing at discipline.”

Marc regularly shares his experience with Mounjaro and weight loss online to his more than 400,000 followers.

One video, discussing the best spot to inject the drug, went viral, garnering more than 340,000 views, over 2,000 likes and hundreds of comments.

In the video, Marc said: “I have tried every single injection site – so the stomach, the arm, the leg.

“For me, the leg was the one that felt the most consistent.

“My cravings felt steadier, fewer rough days, just less of that up and down feeling through the week.”



However, Marc added that this can be different for everyone and his advice would be to try different spots and see what works best for you.

He added that injecting in different spots was “one of the biggest learning curves” for him.

He said: “I had injected in my stomach and arms previously.

“The arm never did anything for me personally.

“The stomach was OK at times, but it felt inconsistent.

“For me, the thigh was completely different.

“It gave me almost instant appetite suppression, I had no side-effects, and the results stayed consistent across the full week.

“I think a lot of it comes down to biology and fat distribution.

“This medication is injected into fatty tissue and releases over time, so finding an area with the right amount of fat can make a difference in how steady that ‘release’ feels for you.

“For me, the thigh has always been that place, and I hear so many other people say the exact same thing.”

In addition to the helpful tip, Marc spoke about the impact that his weight loss journey has had on his confidence and self-image.

He added: “It has been life-changing, but not just in the way people assume.

“Yes, physically I feel different, but the biggest shift is internal.

“I have more energy, I move more easily, and I feel present in my life again.

“My confidence is not just about how I look and fitting into clothes and brands I never could have before, it is about feeling like I have control back, like my body is not fighting me every day, and like my future is not shrinking.[](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37989516/beloved-tv-presenter-dies-secret-cancer-battle-tributes/)

“It has given me peace. And that is something I did not expect.”

# The 7 fat jab mistakes stopping you losing weight

WHILE weight loss jabs have been hailed as a breakthrough in helping tackle Britain’s obesity crisis, some users say they’re missing out on their waist-shrinking powers – and it could be down to some simple mistakes…

**POOR PENMANSHIP**

Many people don’t correctly use the injection pen, according to Ana Carolina Goncalves, a pharmacist at Pharmica in Holborn, London.

Make sure to prime your weight loss pen correctly, as per the instructions. If nothing comes out, try again, and if it still doesn’t work, switch the needle or ask a pharmacist for help.

It’s also recommended to rotate injection sites between the abdomen, thigh and upper arm to avoid small lumps of fat under the skin.

**TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE**

Make sure you’re using the jabs on the most effective day of your schedule.

For example, taking the jab right before a takeaway or party won’t stop you from indulging, says Jason Murphy, head of pharmacy and weight loss expert at Chemist4U.

Weight loss injections need time to build up in your system, so if you’re planning for a heavier weekend, inject your dose mid-week.

**MAKING A MEAL OF IT**

You may not feel the urge to overeat at mealtimes due to the jabs. But skipping meals altogether can backfire, says Dr David Huang, director of clinical innovation at weight loss service Voy.

If a person is extremely malnourished, their body goes into emergency conservation mode, where their metabolism slows down.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

A key mistake using weight loss jabs is not eating the right foods.

As well as cutting out [sugary drinks](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32740578/fizzy-drinks-sugar-worst-most/) and [alcohol](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/alcohol/), Dr Vishal Aggarwal, Healthium Clinics recommends focusing on your protein intake.

**DE-HYDRATION STATIONS**

Dehydration is a common side effect of weight loss injections. But it’s important to stay hydrated in order for your body to function properly.

Dr Crystal Wyllie, GP at Asda Online Doctor, says hydration supports metabolism, digestion, and can reduce side effects like [headaches](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/26138416/common-different-types-headache-how-to-treat/), nausea and [constipation](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/31744477/how-normal-poo-goldilocks-zone-tips-constipation/).

**MOVE IT, MOVE IT**

It can be easy to see the jabs as a quick fix, but stopping [exercising](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/fitness-and-exercise/) altogether is a mistake, says Mital Thakrar, a pharmacist from Well Pharmacy.

Exercise helps maintain muscle mass and help shape the body as you lose weight, which may be crucial if you’re experiencing excess skin.

**QUIT IT**

While there’s the tendency to ditch the jabs as soon as you reach your desired weight, stopping them too soon can cause rapid regain.

Mr Thakrar recommends building habits like healthier eating during treatment for sustaining results.

1qklyf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1qklyf1/aio_client_flirting_with_husband/,AIO Client flirting with husband,"I've been with my partner for over 10 years. I've always trusted him but I think his displaying a very wrong behavior, or I'm overreacting and going crazy.

  
He has a business and he had been complaining for good chunk of 2025 about a particular female client, being very annoying, always requesting favors, but she had a kid and her husband had left her so he felt sorry for her. Then he started coming back home saying she was flirting with him in such obvious ways that it was both surreal and funny. I didn't mind and laughed it off.

  
Fast forward to October-november he's texting her. And tells me they've had coffee together with an employee of his. That she kept flirting with him it was almost pathetic. I said why the sudden change of mind and why he wants to be friends with someone who is flirting with him. He said he was clear with her that he is taken, and that she seemed to understand.

  
In late November, it was nighttime and I was making dinner. He was on the coach, texting and laughing and I knew it was with her. Asked who's so funny and pointed out I was making dinner while he was just there laughing. He apologized. But I felt in my gut something was not right. I grabbed his phone and found no conversation with the woman. He said I had violated his privacy by checking his phone, accused me of not trusting him. I said why delete anything if there's nothing to hide. Next day he told me he had blocked her because she had made a sexual comment and he felt grossed out. 

  
End of December, he says she's come to see him and asked if she had blocked him. He said he would keep it professional only. On a national holiday, he was making lunch, his phone over the counter and a message from her pops up ""does your wife not cook?"". I didn't read anything else, nor I needed it to know it was not work related.

  
This week I've been seeing texts from her pop up. I noticed a symbol next to her profile pic (we use whatsapp in my country). I looked into it and it's a set up to auto delete the conversations with her. I was shocked and checked what little conversation was in there to read. Didn't read it fully, but basically he offered to do her a favor, and she wanted to thank him by inviting him to coffee. He said ok. I must say this, she said she would shower before their coffee (wtf). I felt grossed out.

  
I confronted him last night because I just felt disrespected. I know he didn't cheat and he wouldn't. He says he's just being nice, he is not flirty and it's not his fault if she is. To me, this is crossing a big line, and what pains me are his hidings, not the fear of cheating if that makes sense. He says I'm being overreacting and he wants nothing from her, who probably just wants him for his money (not rich or anything, but business is going well). I said this is about being honest to each other, and also, it wasn't very professional of his. His answer: leaving the house in the middle of the night, saying he did nothing wrong and that he doesn't know where this jealousy is coming from. I'm beyond words.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qklupi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndrewKoloski/comments/1qklupi/describing_artwork_green_bunny/,"Describing Artwork, Green Bunny","

So, I'm going to describe to you some artwork that I created. 



The first one, 



Papi, my father, he says to me, ""Watching Peter Parker, Spider-Man fade away in Avengers was disturbing. It was hard to see a helpless kid begging for his life. It was hard to watch."" 



I asked Dr. Natural (My psychiatrist), ""is Spider-Man begging for his life a metaphor for my psychiatric hospitalizations.





And Dr. Natural says to me, ""Your father probably was disturbed by an emotional scene in a movie. It's not a reference to your suffering.""





The next one, I ask Dr. Dr. Natural (My psychiatrist), ""do you think my parents and stepfather betrayed me behind my back?""



And Dr. Natural says to me, ""Based on sessions, your parents care about you and love you very much. It's delusions of malevolent intent and persecutory delusions. The issue is your mental health, not that your parents secretly betrayed you.""





And the last one is a Green Bunny, Otto Greenberg, who is a 40-year-old mental patient and a caricature of me. He goes into a coffee shop and he sees an attractive barista. 



He says to her, ""Hey, I see you every day. Do you want to go on a date with me?"" 



And the barista says, ""No, you're gross, and a loser, and a man-child.""



Then Otto gets dressed up as Green Bunny, a superhero. He puts on the bunny suit. 



And Green Bunny goes into the coffee shop and asks the same exact barista, ""Want to date a superhero?""



And the barista says, ""I always wanted to date a powerful bunny. Yes!""





I guess that's a metaphor for capitalism, money, and success. She didn't want to date Otto when he had nothing. He was a pathetic man-child. But when Otto puts on the bunny suit, of course, she wants to date him. There's nothing different about Otto, except he's now a powerful superhero.",1,1769158583.0,AndrewKoloski,0,1.0,False

At XDC Network, we're excited to announce the execution of a pivotal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Murundi Group Pty Ltd.","A Strategic Leap Forward for Global Trade on XDC Network!

At XDC Network, we're excited to announce the execution of a pivotal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with [**Murundi Group**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) Pty Ltd. 



This international partnership brings together XDC Australia, XDC India, with support from XDC Innovation Labs, with Melbourne-based Murundi Group, to deploy advanced blockchain-powered solutions for supply chain traceability, digital trade documentation, and align with our global trade finance ecosystem.



It begins by digitising and optimising the high-growth India-Australia trade corridor, with clear pathways to scale globally. India and Australia represent two powerhouse economies with deepening ties, amplified by the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement and the recent Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) for organic products.



This collaboration is strategically vital because it leverages XDC Network's hybrid blockchain infrastructure, enterprise-grade, EVM-compatible, low-cost, and high-speed, to address real-world pain points in international trade: paper-based inefficiencies, opaque provenance, delayed settlements, and limited access to finance.



By focusing on proven lanes like India-Australia, we're creating a scalable model that enhances trust, reduces friction, and unlocks liquidity - ultimately fostering greater economic inclusion for traders, exporters, and SMEs across borders. Central to this effort is the XDC Trade dApp (part of the broader [**XDC Trade Network**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) suite), which serves as the core engine for transforming trade processes via MLETR-compliant digital trade documents and matching Trade Funding. 



In Phase 1 (launching Q1 2026), we'll pilot these capabilities on established India-Australia flows for rice and coffee beans. Success here will accelerate Phase 2, extending the platform to Murundi’s emerging corridors in the Americas and Europe, all the while building a seamless, global blockchain ecosystem that maximises trade volume, liquidity, and efficiency.

# Experience Report – Leaky Gut, Gluten & Histamine (Short Version)

# 1. Background (how it all started)

Around **4 years ago**, I developed strong symptoms:

* Itching and skin scratching
* Red spots on the skin
* Reactions after certain foods

I spent **over 6 months in Thailand** and visited several doctors and so-called *“wellness / anti-aging centers”* (they run much deeper diagnostics than standard hospitals).

**Classic allergy tests** (blood tests at Bangkok Hospital + Allergy Center):

→ **negative**, despite clear symptoms.

Then an **IgG4 sensitivity test** showed:

* **Wheat** very high
* **Garlic** very high

→ Gluten removed long-term, only very rare cheat days

→ additionally used **gluten enzyme capsules (DPP-IV)**

# 2. Leaky Gut diagnosis

At an anti-aging center:

* **Stool test** (exact name unknown)
* Findings: **high aluminum and heavy metal load**
* Explanation: **increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)**

→ Substances enter the bloodstream that should stay in the gut

→ Immune reactions, skin symptoms, food intolerances

# 3. First treatment plan (Leaky Gut focus)

**Nutrition**

* **100% gluten avoidance** (3–6 months)
* Anti-inflammatory diet

**Supplements (ALL that I took):**

**Gut & intestinal lining**

* **L-Glutamine (5–10 g)** – regeneration of the intestinal lining
* **Collagen / bone broth** – mucosal repair
* **Dragon’s blood (Sangre de Drago)** – protective film for the gut wall

**Inflammation**

* **Black seed oil** – anti-inflammatory, mast cell stabilizing
* **Krill oil / Omega-3** – inflammation reduction
* **Curcumin + piperine** – strong anti-inflammatory effect
* **Shilajit & fulvic acids** – cellular and gut regeneration

**Gut flora**

* **Probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria)**
* **Fermented foods** (sauerkraut, kimchi, coconut kefir)

**Antimicrobial / detox**

* **Oregano oil** – against dysbiosis / candida
* **Activated charcoal & zeolite** – toxin binding

**Digestion**

* **DPP-IV enzymes** – gluten breakdown
* **Apple cider vinegar / betaine HCL** – stomach acid support
* **Bitter herbs (dandelion, gentian)** – acid stimulation

**Nutrients**

* **Zinc** – intestinal lining & immune system
* **Vitamin D** – immune system
* **Magnesium** – nerves & digestion
* **B vitamins** – metabolism

# 4. The problem: it got worse

After about **2 months of strict adherence**:

* I tolerated **fewer and fewer foods**
* Reactions to **tomatoes, fermented foods, broth**
* Itching and flushing → suspected **histamine intolerance**

→ Realization:

**The gut was still inflamed – rebuilding was started too early**

# 5. Key insight (doctor’s explanation)

**Leaky gut – histamine – stomach acid are directly connected**

**Domino effect:**

1. **Low stomach acid** → bacteria survive
2. **SIBO / dysbiosis** → bacteria produce histamine themselves
3. **Damaged intestinal lining** → DAO enzyme is reduced
4. **Histamine is not broken down** → symptoms

👉 You cannot rebuild the gut while it is still inflamed.

# 6. Second plan: calm histamine first

**Histamine triggers that caused the crash:**

* **Tursu / fermented foods** – very high histamine
* **Tomatoes** – histamine liberators
* **Bone broth >8 hours cooked** – histamine source
* **Ferment mixes / probiotics** – introduced too early

→ DAO overwhelmed → histamine overload

# 7. Histamine reset & DAO support

**Key supplements (ALL + effect):**

**DAO & histamine breakdown**

* **DAO enzyme (e.g. DAOSIN)** – breaks down histamine in the gut
* **Vitamin B6 (P-5-P)** – cofactor for DAO
* **Copper (0.5–1 mg)** – essential for DAO activity

**Mucosal healing**

* **L-Glutamine** – regeneration of intestinal cells
* **Aloe vera (99%)** – soothes and regenerates
* **Zinc carnosine** – protects tight junctions
* **Black seed oil** – mast cell inhibition

**Lowering & binding histamine**

* **Vitamin C (500–1000 mg)** – supports histamine breakdown
* **Quercetin (500 mg)** – mast cell stabilizer
* **Camu-camu powder** – natural vitamin C source
* **Zeolite / bentonite** – binds histamine in the gut

# 8. Diet in this phase

**Low-histamine, fresh, no fermented foods**

# 🟢 ALLOWED

*(low histamine, mast-cell friendly, currently safe)*

# 🥤 Drinks & Juices (freshly pressed, no ice!)

* Celery juice

* It was **leaky gut + dysbiosis + secondary histamine intolerance**
* Rebuilding only **after inflammation is reduced**
* Everything in **phases, not all at once**
* **Self-experiment with tests and help from the wellnes clinic – not universally transferable**",0,1769157782.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,0.5,False

I had much intended to recount the happenings of that foul but beautiful environ freshly, but upon setting eyes at last on the depot here, I felt incensed to fall upon my bed before even shaking the ice from my boots.

   My hands tremble still as I recall my times there, stinging from rope burns and close calls with frostbite's kiss. The wolves there. My lord. I was told of the beasts, graciously, in advance by some of those intrepid other explorers foolish, brave, & desperate enough to journey not only in but out of the region. I still found myself underestimating them. I brought in over a hundred rifle rounds, and have returned with near half of my stock depleted. Great in number, yes, but their main strength felt in equal parts familiar and terrifying. Hunger. They are driven by the same base need as you or I, Deputy. The same as all the animals here. But nothing else has come close to feeling as human as us. Planning, strategy. Hatred. Pitiful things.

   But having survived, I must admit a beauty within the savagery there. Every morning that I managed to awake, the breath tasted sweeter in my frozen tongue. Every wolven steak harvested felt like a gift from the mountain itself. Every battle won there feels like you're the luckiest man in the world, if only to make the next blizzard  sting so much worse. Feeling you have mastered the region is a powerful elixir, even if you know that's the hubris of good luck(so far) giving you that feeling.

   But now our time in the West draws to and end. We'll be headed back East soon, to the Coast. These maps we've been working on... All the resources and wild game. All this damn coal. Enough to heat every home in the settlement! We're really doing something worth doing here, Dep.

I have heard many different things about him, such as punching a wall near her because he was mad at her,checking her phone all the time, her not being able to go out much, and that he almost hooked up with another girl. There was this one time she was asking me questions, and he came in to bring her food, and he apparently got mad at me because I was talking to her. She later apologized to me after. She invited me out one time to go drink with her and her best friend, her best friend's boyfriend, and sister, but I told her I couldn't because I didn't want to get involved with her husband if he showed up.

Your test suite takes 5 minutes to run. You make a small change, hit `cargo test`, and wait. And wait. You check Twitter. Still waiting. By the time tests finish, you've forgotten what you were working on.

I've been there. My phrase_bot had 10 database tests. Each one needed a clean database. The ""safe"" solution? Run them sequentially with `#[serial]`. The result? A coffee break every time I ran the suite.

Then I discovered how to combine `#[sqlx::test]` with teremock and everything changed. Same tests, but running in parallel with complete isolation. No cleanup code. No flaky failures. No more coffee breaks.

This article walks through why traditional database testing is painful, how isolation-based testing solves it, and how to set it up with teremock for your Telegram bot. By the end, you'll have a pattern that scales to hundreds of tests without slowing down.

## The Pain of Sequential Database Tests

Let's talk about what most of us do when we first add database tests to a project.

You write your first test. It creates a user, checks something, passes. Great. You write a second test. It also creates a user with the same ID because you copied the first test. Now you have a primary key conflict. Tests fail randomly depending on execution order.

The ""obvious"" fix is to clean up the database before each test. You write a helper function that deletes everything:

```rust
async fn cleanup_database(pool: &PgPool) {
    sqlx::query(""DELETE FROM phrases"").execute(pool).await.unwrap();
    sqlx::query(""DELETE FROM users"").execute(pool).await.unwrap();
}

#[tokio::test]
#[serial]
async fn test_create_user() {
    let pool = get_test_pool().await;
    cleanup_database(pool).await;
    // ... test code
}
```

This works until it doesn't. And it stops working in subtle, frustrating ways.

**The ordering problem.** You add a `phrases` table with a foreign key to `users`. Now `DELETE FROM users` fails because phrases reference those users. You need to delete phrases first. Every schema change potentially breaks your cleanup function. These bugs don't appear immediately — they appear weeks later when someone adds a foreign key and forgets to update the cleanup order.

**The forgotten table problem.** You add a `settings` table. You forget to add it to cleanup. Tests pass locally because you're running them in a certain order. CI runs them differently. Random failures. You spend an hour debugging before realizing the cleanup is incomplete.

**The performance problem.** To avoid all these race conditions, you slap `#[serial]` on every test. Now they run one at a time. Ten tests at 500ms each is 5 seconds. Fifty tests is 25 seconds. A hundred tests is almost a minute. You stop running the full suite. You start running ""just the tests for this file."" Bugs slip through.

**The CI flakiness problem.** Even with `#[serial]`, I've seen tests that pass locally and fail in GitHub Actions. Different machines, different timing, different connection pooling behavior. The database connection from the previous test hasn't fully closed yet. Or migrations run in a weird order. These are the worst bugs because they're not reproducible locally.

The fundamental issue is that we're trying to reuse a shared resource (the database) across tests that should be independent. We're fighting the architecture instead of working with it.

## The Isolation Insight

What if instead of cleaning a shared database, each test got its own database?

Think about it. Test A runs against `test_db_abc123`. Test B runs against `test_db_def456`. They can't possibly interfere with each other. They can run in parallel. No cleanup needed — just drop the database when the test ends.

This sounds expensive. Creating and dropping databases has overhead, right?

Yes, but less than you'd think. PostgreSQL can create an empty database in about 50-100ms. That's nothing compared to the time you save by running tests in parallel. If you have 20 tests that each take 500ms, sequential execution takes 10 seconds. Parallel execution with 100ms overhead per test? Under 2 seconds on a multi-core machine.

This is exactly what `#[sqlx::test]` does. It's a macro from the sqlx crate that:

1. Creates a fresh database with a unique name before your test runs
2. Runs your migrations automatically
3. Passes a connection pool to your test function
4. Drops the database after the test completes (pass or fail)

```rust
#[sqlx::test(migrator = ""crate::db::MIGRATOR"")]
async fn test_create_user(pool: PgPool) {
    // This pool connects to a brand new database
    // Named something like: myapp_test_a7f3b2c1
    // No other test can see this data
    // Dropped automatically when the test ends
}
```

The beauty is in what you *don't* have to write. No cleanup functions. No `#[serial]`. No careful ordering of deletions. The isolation is handled at the database level, which is exactly where it should be.

## Integrating with teremock

Here's where it gets interesting for Telegram bot developers. teremock already gives you isolated bot instances — each `MockBot` has its own mock server on a random port. Combining that with `#[sqlx::test]` gives you complete test isolation: isolated bot, isolated database, fully parallel execution.

The setup requires two pieces. First, you need to export your migrator so sqlx can find your migrations:

```rust
// src/db/mod.rs
pub static MIGRATOR: sqlx::migrate::Migrator = sqlx::migrate!(""./migrations"");
```

This is a static reference to your migrations directory. The `sqlx::migrate!` macro reads the migration files at compile time, so there's no runtime file system access.

Second, you write your tests using `#[sqlx::test]` instead of `#[tokio::test]`, and you inject the pool into your MockBot:

```rust
#[sqlx::test(migrator = ""crate::db::MIGRATOR"")]
async fn test_start_creates_user(pool: PgPool) {
    let mut bot = MockBot::new(
        MockMessageText::new().text(""/start""),
        handler_tree()
    ).await;

    // This is the critical line — inject the isolated database
    bot.dependencies(dptree::deps![pool.clone()]);

    bot.dispatch().await;

    let user = db::get_user(&pool, MockUser::ID as i64).await.unwrap();
    assert!(user.nickname.is_none());
}
```

The `pool` parameter is your isolated database. When you inject it into the bot's dependencies, all your handlers that expect a `PgPool` will receive this isolated instance. Your handler code doesn't change at all — it still accepts `pool: PgPool` and runs queries against it. But in tests, that pool points to a database that exists only for this one test.

## Testing Complex Flows

The real payoff comes when you're testing multi-step dialogues with database interactions.

My phrase_bot lets users create custom phrases through a conversation. The user clicks ""Add phrase,"" enters an emoji, enters a trigger word, enters a response template, and the bot saves it to the database. Testing this requires both dialogue state and database state to work together.

With the old approach, I'd need to carefully set up the database, run through the dialogue, verify the result, then clean up. If another test also created phrases, I'd need `#[serial]` to prevent conflicts. The test file became a minefield of ordering dependencies.

With `#[sqlx::test]`, each test is completely self-contained:

```rust
#[sqlx::test(migrator = ""crate::db::MIGRATOR"")]
async fn test_add_phrase_flow(pool: PgPool) {
    // Create the user this test needs
    db::create_user(&pool, MockUser::ID as i64).await.unwrap();

    let mut bot = MockBot::new(
        MockMessageText::new().text(""/start""),
        handler_tree()
    ).await;
    bot.dependencies(deps![get_test_storage(), pool.clone()]);

    // Walk through the dialogue
    bot.dispatch().await;
    bot.update(MockMessageText::new().text(""Add phrase""));
    bot.dispatch().await;

    // ... user enters emoji, trigger text, response template ...

    // Verify it saved to OUR database (not shared with anyone)
    let phrases = db::get_user_phrases(&pool, MockUser::ID as i64).await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(phrases[0].emoji, ""🤗"");
}
```

Now I can write a deletion test that also uses the same user ID:

```rust
#[sqlx::test(migrator = ""crate::db::MIGRATOR"")]
async fn test_delete_phrase_flow(pool: PgPool) {
    // Set up a phrase to delete
    db::create_user(&pool, MockUser::ID as i64).await.unwrap();
    db::create_phrase(&pool, MockUser::ID as i64, ""🤗"", ""hug"", ""..."").await.unwrap();

    let mut bot = MockBot::new(/* ... */).await;
    bot.dependencies(deps![get_test_storage(), pool.clone()]);

    // ... navigate to delete, confirm deletion ...

    let phrases = db::get_user_phrases(&pool, MockUser::ID as i64).await.unwrap();
    assert!(phrases.is_empty());
}
```

Both tests use `MockUser::ID`. Both manipulate phrases. With `#[serial]` and shared databases, that's a conflict waiting to happen. With `#[sqlx::test]`, they run in parallel without a care in the world. Different databases, no interference.

This changes how you think about test design. You stop worrying about ""what state will the database be in when this test runs?"" Each test defines its own preconditions. Each test is a fresh start. The cognitive load drops dramatically.

## Performance: The Numbers

I ran benchmarks on my phrase_bot test suite to quantify the difference. Here's what I found:

| Approach | 8 tests | 20 tests | 50 tests |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| `#[serial]` + cleanup | 4.2s | 10.5s | 26.3s |
| `#[sqlx::test]` parallel | 1.1s | 1.8s | 3.2s |

The speedup is **4-8x**, and the gap widens as you add more tests.

Why? Sequential execution scales linearly with test count. If each test takes 500ms, 50 tests take 25 seconds. There's no way around it.

Parallel execution scales with your CPU cores. On my 8-core machine, 8 tests that each take 500ms complete in roughly 600ms (500ms for the test plus ~100ms database overhead). The marginal cost of additional tests is just the overhead of creating the database, not the execution time.

The practical impact is huge. 26 seconds is ""I'll check my phone while this runs."" 3 seconds is ""already done before I looked away."" When tests are fast, you run them more often. When you run them more often, you catch bugs earlier. Earlier bugs are cheaper to fix.

## Gotchas and Solutions

After using this pattern for several months, I've hit a few recurring issues.

**Forgetting to inject the pool** is the most common mistake. Your test runs, your bot dispatches, and nothing happens. No error, just silence. The handler tried to access the database, got a different pool (or none), and quietly failed.

```rust
// Wrong: bot has no access to your test database
bot.dispatch().await;

// Right: inject dependencies BEFORE dispatch
bot.dependencies(deps![pool.clone()]);
bot.dispatch().await;
```

Make this a habit: `MockBot::new()`, then `dependencies()`, then `dispatch()`. Every time.

**Connection limits** can bite you with large test suites. PostgreSQL has a default `max_connections` setting (usually 100). If you're running 50 tests in parallel, each with its own connection pool, you might exceed that limit.

Solutions, in order of preference:
1. Use PgBouncer for connection pooling
2. Increase `max_connections` in postgresql.conf
3. Limit test parallelism: `cargo test -- --test-threads=4`

**Missing DATABASE_URL** is another gotcha. `#[sqlx::test]` needs to know where to create test databases. It reads `DATABASE_URL` from the environment and uses that server to create/drop the temporary databases. Make sure your `.env` file has it set, or export it in your shell before running tests.

## When Not to Use This

No technique is universally applicable. Here's when you might skip `#[sqlx::test]`:

**Very small test suites.** If you have 3 tests that run in 200ms total, the overhead of creating databases isn't worth it. Just use `#[serial]` and move on.

**Tests that intentionally share state.** Sometimes you want test B to see data created by test A. This is rare and often a code smell, but if you genuinely need it, isolated databases won't work.

**SQLite in-memory databases.** SQLite's in-memory mode creates a new database per connection automatically. You already have isolation. `#[sqlx::test]` still works, but you're not gaining much.

**Tests hitting external services.** If your tests call real APIs (payment processors, third-party services), parallel execution might trigger rate limits. Though arguably, those calls should be mocked anyway.

## Making the Switch

If you're convinced and want to migrate an existing test suite, here's the process:

1. **Add the migrator export.** Create `pub static MIGRATOR: sqlx::migrate::Migrator = sqlx::migrate!(""./migrations"");` in your database module.

2. **Ensure DATABASE_URL is set.** Add it to `.env` or your CI environment variables.

3. **Convert tests one at a time.** Replace `#[tokio::test]` with `#[sqlx::test(migrator = ""crate::db::MIGRATOR"")]`. Add `pool: PgPool` as the first parameter. Add `bot.dependencies(deps![pool.clone()])`.

4. **Remove cleanup code.** Delete your `cleanup_database()` function. Delete `#[serial]` attributes.

5. **Run and verify.** Run `cargo test` and watch them execute in parallel. Check that all tests still pass.

The conversion is mechanical. Most tests require changing 3-4 lines. The payoff is immediate — your test suite gets faster with every test you convert.

## Wrapping Up

The combination of teremock for bot mocking and `#[sqlx::test]` for database isolation transformed my testing workflow. What used to take 5 minutes now takes 15 seconds. What used to fail randomly in CI now passes reliably every time.

But the real win isn't the speed. It's the simplicity. No cleanup functions to maintain. No ordering dependencies to track. No `#[serial]` attributes to remember. Each test is an island, complete and self-sufficient.

When the feedback loop is fast, you test more. When tests are simple, you write more of them. When you have more tests, you ship fewer bugs.

That's the goal, isn't it?

1qklfmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1qklfmo/been_out_of_the_dating_game_a_long_time_i_dont/,"Been out of the dating game a long time, I don’t know how to know if someone’s interested anymore, any advice?","Hi there,

I’m not even sure if this is even the right place to ask things like this but:

I’m a 31m, I’ve been single for 5 years. I’ve gone of dates, I’ve had a few flings during that time but nothing has ever stuck. I was previously in a 4 year relationship and after I took a long period to rediscover myself and focus on me, during that time I became a bit reclusive in the sense of not going out to bars or anything, and eventually quit drinking all together to focus on health. With that being said, I don’t go to bars much and so dating has been pretty hard as most connections start from places like Tinder or Hinge that don’t really go anywhere. But I’ve been really into one guy for a while, but I really honestly can’t tell if he’s mutually interested or he just wants to be friends.

A smidge of background, after my relationship ended I high tailed it out of the city and moved back to my hometown, where options are more limited dating wise but things are more affordable and I had a support system. I reconnected with lots of people, and met a few new ones. One of the people I met is that exact guy, originally when we started chatting it was pretty generic, or sexually charged. That kinda went away with time, and we just kinda talked casually and occasionally. Somewhere in the last few months we started talking more, it’s never sexual, but he does seem interested in getting to know me. He’s not the best at messaging sometimes, where there’s longer interludes between messages, but we do talk daily now. He’s self admittedly bashful, and has told me before that he was afraid to talk to me at the gym because I’m “beautiful” and he thought I would be meaner, even though we had messaged off and on for awhile. We actually have a lot in common, we have birthdays a few days apart, he’s also been single roughly the same amount of time, we work similar jobs (I’m a nurse, he’s an occupational therapist), we have a lot of the same interests musically, hobby wise, movie and television wise, and also seem to generally enjoy a lot of the same things. I tried for quite a while to actually pin down a time to meet up for coffee or something to which he agreed finally and we met up at a local coffee shop for a few hours and just talked.

We literally both raced to try to pay for the orders (I won), and had a nice time, I’ve mentioned meeting up again and he is susceptible to it. We message everyday, he messages me good morning everyday and we talk periodically throughout the day. Sometimes some of the things he says I can’t honestly tell at all if he’s interested like that or just a really friendly guy, he’s very sweet, and very attractive. So sometimes I think I’m just reading it how I would like things to be perceived. I was originally going to move back to the city, so I wouldn’t have to commute 40 minutes to my job but also to try to be more social, he owns a house in our town, however I found a steal of a deal on a house here in town and put an offer in that was accepted, despite my fears of dissolving dating options (a large portion of city gays have a thing against coming to the burbs). I have kinda felt that after he found out I was looking at houses around here (a process I started months ago, looking both here and the city, with less in the city in the more recent months due to the cost difference and having aging family here) he’s seemed to be more open to doing things or communicating more. He does often ask me about my day, seems generally interested in my interests and what I have to say, and since meeting for coffee (which was a first time in person one on one encounter, excluding brief conversations at the gym) has said things about planning other things out or when I mentioned how I would love to go to the zoo or gardens (just generally) has stated that we could plan things like that when it gets warmer. He’s very easy to talk to, and I genuinely enjoy the conversation and look forward to seeing I have messages from him but since I’ve also been single for quite sometime, I’m off my game and have become quite accustom to how direct some guys (mainly fuckboys who never grew out of it, considering we’re in our 30’s now) are, it makes me second guess it. Basically can someone here help Stella get her groove back? Cause I’m not sure if I’m reading into things, over thinking, getting in my head, or barking up the wrong beautiful blonde tree.

If I learned anything about myself as I’ve gotten older is while getting older has made me more confident and comfortable, I’m the best a flirting or charming and understanding a situation when it’s not something I’m actively trying to pursue, or I know it’s not going anywhere (we’ve all flirted just to flirt, or whatever) but I in actuality am just a weary idiot lol who doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing, and I’m basically a clueless teenager in a 30 something body.

I've been reading a lot of tech news recently about companies upgrading their voice assistants (like Alexa) with LLMs, but I'm trying to wrap my head around the actual engineering implementation.

I have a few questions about how this works ""under the hood"" and would love some technical insights:

**1. From Chat to Action:** I've heard terms like ""Function Calling"" thrown around. Is that how an LLM actually controls a physical machine? How does a text-based model technically ""press the button"" on a coffee maker?

**2. The ""Refusal"" Problem:** I often read users complaining that LLM-based assistants sometimes refuse simple commands or act weirdly compared to the old rigid systems. Why does this happen? Is it because the model gets ""confused"" by the context, or is it a safety feature gone wrong?

**3. Industry Solutions:** How are engineers solving these reliability issues right now? Are they restricting what the LLM can do, or are there new methods to make them more obedient and consistent?

1qkleqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heyramp/comments/1qkleqc/strategies_for_improving_employee_engagement_and/,Strategies for improving employee engagement and retention - The High-Performance Retention Flywheel,"Perks like free coffee or casual Fridays are no longer the glue that holds a team together. True engagement and long-term retention are built on a foundation of high standards, deep relationships, and precise communication. If you want to keep your top talent in 2026, you must move beyond administrative management and embrace a performance-driven culture.

Here are the four pillars as I see them of a ""modern"" retention strategy.

# 1. Build Relationships, Not Just Reports

People don't stay for companies, they stay for people. Building a genuine relationship with your team members is the single most effective way to foster loyalty. This doesn’t mean being everyone's best friend, but it does mean understanding what drives them and what they care about in life (life isn't only KPIs!) - The most effective way to do this consistantly is conducting frequent regular one on one sessions. 

* **The ""Whole Person"" Approach:** Learn their career aspirations, their preferred work style, and what they value in their personal life.
* **Psychological Safety:** When a relationship is grounded in trust, employees feel safe to innovate, take risks, and speak up before they reach the point of burnout and share personal problems that might impact work (and... they will likely share if they are thinking about leaving, before handing in their resignation).

# 2. The Power of Consistent Feedback

Waiting for an annual review to discuss performance is a recipe for disengagement. Top performers crave clarity. They want to know exactly where they stand and how they can improve in real-time.

* **Micro-Feedback:** Implement a ""continuous feedback"" loop. A two-minute conversation after a meeting or a quick Friday check-in is more valuable than a three-hour formal review once a year.
* **Focus on Growth:** Use feedback as a tool for coaching rather than policing. When employees see that you are invested in their professional evolution, they are far less likely to look for opportunities elsewhere.

# 3. Address the ""Dead Wood"" - aka dealing with poor performance!

One of the fastest ways to lose a top performer is to force them to work alongside someone who isn't pulling their weight. High achievers are intrinsically motivated by excellence, when they see poor performance being tolerated, their own engagement plummets or worse you risk losing your best people, but not dealing with the lower performers.

* **The High-Bar Standard:** Addressing poor performance isn’t just about the underperformer, it’s a signal to your best people that you value their hard work and protect the quality of the team.
* **Fairness and Accountability:** When you hold everyone to a high standard, you create an environment where top talent feels respected and challenged, rather than burdened.

# 4. Adaptive Communication Styles

One size does not fit all when it comes to communication. Some team members thrive on direct, blunt feedback, while others require a more collaborative and nuanced approach.

* **Meet Them Where They Are:** Understand the personality profiles of your team. Are they data-driven? Are they people-oriented? Adjust your delivery to match their ""frequency.""
* **Platform Preference:** Respect boundaries by using the right channels—keep urgent matters to synchronous calls and deep-work updates to asynchronous tools.

A simple way to quickly improve your communication skills as a leader is to learn more about DISC behavior, there are plenty of free tests available, where you can get to know yourself and your communication style better. 

# The Bottom Line

Retention is the result of a culture where people feel seen, heard, and challenged. By prioritizing relationships and maintaining high standards, you create a workplace that top performers never want to leave.",1,1769156890.0,heyramp,0,1.0,False

""Baby?"" I called out.



My voice bounced off the walls of Marcus's living room as I walked inside. ""Baby?"" I tried again, tossing my leather purse onto the couch.



That's when I spotted them.



Fresh roses. A small jewelry box. Wine.



My pulse quickened with anticipation.



""He actually remembered,"" I whispered, a twinge of guilt hitting me.



I'd come here ready to tear into Marcus for forgetting our two-year anniversary and probably skipping my promotion celebration tonight.



""Marcus,"" I said, stepping toward the gifts.



I grabbed the wine bottle from the wooden table and my stomach dropped. Already opened, with two empty glasses I hadn't noticed before.



My brow furrowed as I set the bottle down and headed toward the bedroom.



""Marcus!"" I shouted this time, shoving the door wide.



I went rigid.



Marcus was in bed with another woman. Their groans filled the space, making me sick.



Disbelief crashed through me as I stood frozen, watching my boyfriend fuck someone else.



""Marcus!"" I screamed, finally finding my voice.



""Let me fucking finish,"" Marcus growled back, his voice rough with lust and irritation.



My gut clenched, but I couldn't move—couldn't look away as Marcus thrust with the same rhythm that used to drive me wild.



""Fuck! Yes! Yes!"" Marcus groaned, his movements growing frantic before he collapsed, gasping.



Tears stung my eyes unexpectedly. I clenched my jaw, fighting to keep from shaking. I'd barely processed what I was seeing when I recognized the woman next to Marcus.



""Janelle,"" I breathed, more tears blurring my vision.



Janelle propped herself up on one elbow, lips curved in a cruel smile. ""Hey Elena, so nice of you to drop by.""



I stared at Janelle's boldness. Even after everything I'd witnessed, part of me kept hoping for some reasonable explanation. I ignored Janelle as she draped her legs over Marcus's shoulders.



Marcus gripped those legs, kissing each one slowly.



I flinched. ""What the hell is this?"" I demanded, trying to sound strong but hearing my voice shake.



""What's it look like?"" Janelle shot back, her smirk growing wider. ""We were discussing the weather.""



Marcus chuckled at her sarcasm, running his fingers through his messy hair. ""It's exactly what you think, El. We're done.""



The way he said my nickname made rage boil inside me. He didn't get to cheat and then act casual about it. I wiped my face with my sleeve, sniffling.



""I can't believe I wasted two years on you!"" I shouted, trying to sound as venomous as possible. ""I gave you everything and you couldn't even have the decency to—""



""I gave you everything!"" Marcus cut me off, wrapping the pink sheet I'd bought him for Christmas around his waist. ""I'm the one who wasted time. You never deserved any of it. Not my love, and sure as hell not that job.""



Janelle smirked, and it felt like a knife to my chest. I moved closer, eyes blazing.



""You can't claim you handed me that job. I busted my ass to earn it.""



Marcus let out a harsh laugh. ""My connections did. You think Cal would hire some nobody like you without me pulling strings?""



""Obviously not,"" Janelle added, sitting up straight. ""Everyone knows you only screwed Marcus so his buddy would give you work, you pathetic slut.""



I gasped, tears threatening to spill again.



Not here. Not now.



They both laughed, and my face burned with humiliation. But before the tears could fall, I bolted.



In the living room, I screamed and flipped the coffee table, sending everything crashing to the floor.



Childish? Maybe. But I needed to feel something other than this crushing pain in my chest.



I held back the tears until I reached Minnie's house. When I got there, they came flooding out, blinding me completely. I crumpled to the ground, my chest feeling like it might cave in.



""Elena?"" Minnie called out. Seeing my state, concern flooded her voice. ""What happened?""



""Marcus... Janelle..."" I managed through my shaking voice.



Minnie sat beside me, pulling me close. ""Breathe deep and tell me everything.""



I followed her lead, my racing heart slowing under Minnie's calming presence. I hiccupped, another tear sliding down as I recounted the whole nightmare.



""Janelle? From your work?""



I nodded.



""How does she even know Marcus?""



""Through Cal, obviously,"" I sniffled.



""That fucking bitch. I can't believe she'd do that. And Marcus? Tonight of all nights?"" Minnie's voice climbed with fury.



My stomach twisted again. Tonight was supposed to be my career highlight. I'd finally scored the promotion, finally made it to news editor after breaking that massive story. I should've been celebrating with Marcus, marking a new chapter.



He'd destroyed our anniversary and now this too. I wasn't even sure I wanted to show up anymore.



""I'm staying home,"" I said aloud.



Minnie frowned. ""Like hell you are. You've worked your ass off for this position and you've earned this celebration."" She squeezed me tighter. ""Don't let him break you.""



""But—""



""No excuses,"" Minnie interrupted firmly. ""You're going to your party. Marcus isn't going to drag you down. You've earned this.""



""I've earned this,"" I repeated, though I didn't quite believe it yet.



Minnie stood up, her expression softening. She held out her hand. ""Come on, let's get you ready. Tonight's going to be amazing.""



I managed a weak smile as I reluctantly took her hand. Thoughts of Marcus and Janelle kept creeping in, but I shoved them aside.



Even though all I wanted was to cry myself to sleep, I refused to let those assholes ruin another second of my day.



So I followed Minnie to her bedroom, where we got ready. Two hours later, I was wearing a red dress with a thigh-high slit. Minnie had styled my brown hair in an elegant updo and done my makeup perfectly.



""You look absolutely stunning,"" Minnie said with a satisfied grin.



I studied my reflection, feeling more centered now.



""Yeah,"" I agreed.



""Let me get dressed too,"" Minnie said.



An hour later, we headed to Sector Freedom's VIP section.



Minnie, gorgeous in a sleek black dress, whispered behind me. ""I can't wait to see the setup, and that bitch's expression. You need to show her who's boss now, Elena.""



Minnie's words sparked something inside me, and my heart fluttered—not with pain this time, but with a hint of rebellion.



I would definitely show Janelle.



As we entered the VIP area, ice ran through my veins. My coworkers were already there, but instead of the welcoming faces I'd expected, I saw pitying stares and hushed conversations.



Was I imagining things?



""What's their problem?"" Minnie asked nervously.



The question made my stomach clench, but before I could answer, Janelle and Marcus emerged from across the room, fingers intertwined.



The pain slammed back—brutal and unforgiving in my chest.



Minnie found my hand, squeezing gently.



Before either of us could say anything, Cal stepped forward with a champagne flute in one hand and a microphone in the other.



""Thanks everyone for coming tonight,"" he started, his gaze finding mine and lingering. ""But there's been a change of plans. Tonight we're celebrating Janelle—she's our new editor. Congratulations, Nell.""



Bewilderment crashed over me, my heart plummeting.



What the fuck just happened?

...

Elena's POV



""What... what's happening?"" I managed to ask despite my confusion.



But my question drowned as claps and whistles filled the room.



I blinked, my cheeks burning with a mixture of anger and embarrassment. Marcus and Janelle were laughing, clinking glasses with everyone else.



""Okay, this is officially insane,"" Minnie said, her voice shaking slightly. ""What just happened?""



I watched as Cal whispered something in Janelle's ear. They both looked at me and laughed.



The gesture pierced my heart, and controlled by anger and humiliation, I marched toward them. Minnie hurried behind me, whispering some words of caution, but I ignored them.



""What's this game, Cal?"" I demanded, my voice shaky.



""Ah, Elena. I didn't see you there,"" Cal said with a lopsided smile. He took my hand and pulled me closer. ""Congratulate your boss.""



I yanked my hand away, my mouth twitching. ""This is my party."" I raised my voice. ""I am the editor. I had the big break, not her!""



My words silenced the room. Suddenly, all eyes turned to me.



""What are you doing?"" Minnie whispered.



I swallowed, my cheeks burning as I looked around. Shame curled inside me, but it was too late now.



""This is my... party,"" I repeated, lower this time, my voice breaking. ""Janelle... has to leave.""



Marcus scoffed, and Janelle laughed.



Cal stepped closer, addressing the crowd. ""There has been a misunderstanding. Yesterday, Miss Vane agreed to give up the editorial position to Miss Porter."" He pointed to Janelle, who waved proudly.



I froze. I never did that. ""I never-""



""Miss Vane knows she wouldn't be able to handle this important duty,"" Cal interrupted smoothly. ""Out of loyalty to this organization, she came to my office to explain this.""



I was about to protest when Cal leaned closer, his eyes red with rage, his voice sharp and low so only I could hear. ""If you want to grow in this career, you'll behave and do as I say. My investors are here.""



Our eyes met, and I flinched at the madness in Cal's.



""Miss Vane has something to say,"" Cal said, shoving me the microphone.



I took it, swallowing hard as the silence intensified. ""Yes..."" My voice cracked as all eyes bored into me. I looked at Minnie, whose forehead was creased with worry.



Cal frowned, and my stomach dropped.



I wanted to scream, but with Cal's frown and the crowd's stares, I gave in.



""I... spoke... to Cal... and explained..."" My blush deepened as I turned to Janelle. ""Congratulations.""



""Oh thank you, Elena,"" Janelle gave a fake smile. ""I'm glad you realized you aren't meant for such an important position and handed it to me, who is worthy."" She sneered. ""Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.""



Something snapped inside me, and it wasn't just Janelle's speech. It was the way Marcus held Janelle close and kissed her.



The crowd hesitated for a moment, before applause filled the room again.



I wanted to speak, but Cal snatched the microphone. ""There you have it. At Imperial media house, we prioritize our employees' mental health. Please give it up for Janelle and... Elena.""



The cheers broke the last bit of pride inside me.



Cal said other things, but I didn't hear. Panic rose in my chest, tightening it, seizing my breath.



Someone held me, guiding me out of the room.



Fresh air cooled my face and slowly, I began to breathe again under command.



""You're okay,"" Minnie whispered, pulling me into a hug.



I let the tears flow, hoping they would fix something in my heart. But the celebration inside made it impossible.



""I'm sorry love,"" Minnie murmured. ""I'm so sorry.""



I nodded, wiping my tears. Then my gaze shifted to the bar behind Minnie. ""I need a drink.""



Minnie blinked. ""You-""",1,1769156764.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False

""Baby?"" I called out.



My voice bounced off the walls of Marcus's living room as I walked inside. ""Baby?"" I tried again, tossing my leather purse onto the couch.



That's when I spotted them.



Fresh roses. A small jewelry box. Wine.



My pulse quickened with anticipation.



""He actually remembered,"" I whispered, a twinge of guilt hitting me.



I'd come here ready to tear into Marcus for forgetting our two-year anniversary and probably skipping my promotion celebration tonight.



""Marcus,"" I said, stepping toward the gifts.



I grabbed the wine bottle from the wooden table and my stomach dropped. Already opened, with two empty glasses I hadn't noticed before.



My brow furrowed as I set the bottle down and headed toward the bedroom.



""Marcus!"" I shouted this time, shoving the door wide.



I went rigid.



Marcus was in bed with another woman. Their groans filled the space, making me sick.



Disbelief crashed through me as I stood frozen, watching my boyfriend fuck someone else.



""Marcus!"" I screamed, finally finding my voice.



""Let me fucking finish,"" Marcus growled back, his voice rough with lust and irritation.



My gut clenched, but I couldn't move—couldn't look away as Marcus thrust with the same rhythm that used to drive me wild.



""Fuck! Yes! Yes!"" Marcus groaned, his movements growing frantic before he collapsed, gasping.



Tears stung my eyes unexpectedly. I clenched my jaw, fighting to keep from shaking. I'd barely processed what I was seeing when I recognized the woman next to Marcus.



""Janelle,"" I breathed, more tears blurring my vision.



Janelle propped herself up on one elbow, lips curved in a cruel smile. ""Hey Elena, so nice of you to drop by.""



I stared at Janelle's boldness. Even after everything I'd witnessed, part of me kept hoping for some reasonable explanation. I ignored Janelle as she draped her legs over Marcus's shoulders.



Marcus gripped those legs, kissing each one slowly.



I flinched. ""What the hell is this?"" I demanded, trying to sound strong but hearing my voice shake.



""What's it look like?"" Janelle shot back, her smirk growing wider. ""We were discussing the weather.""



Marcus chuckled at her sarcasm, running his fingers through his messy hair. ""It's exactly what you think, El. We're done.""



The way he said my nickname made rage boil inside me. He didn't get to cheat and then act casual about it. I wiped my face with my sleeve, sniffling.



""I can't believe I wasted two years on you!"" I shouted, trying to sound as venomous as possible. ""I gave you everything and you couldn't even have the decency to—""



""I gave you everything!"" Marcus cut me off, wrapping the pink sheet I'd bought him for Christmas around his waist. ""I'm the one who wasted time. You never deserved any of it. Not my love, and sure as hell not that job.""



Janelle smirked, and it felt like a knife to my chest. I moved closer, eyes blazing.



""You can't claim you handed me that job. I busted my ass to earn it.""



Marcus let out a harsh laugh. ""My connections did. You think Cal would hire some nobody like you without me pulling strings?""



""Obviously not,"" Janelle added, sitting up straight. ""Everyone knows you only screwed Marcus so his buddy would give you work, you pathetic slut.""



I gasped, tears threatening to spill again.



Not here. Not now.



They both laughed, and my face burned with humiliation. But before the tears could fall, I bolted.



In the living room, I screamed and flipped the coffee table, sending everything crashing to the floor.



Childish? Maybe. But I needed to feel something other than this crushing pain in my chest.



I held back the tears until I reached Minnie's house. When I got there, they came flooding out, blinding me completely. I crumpled to the ground, my chest feeling like it might cave in.



""Elena?"" Minnie called out. Seeing my state, concern flooded her voice. ""What happened?""



""Marcus... Janelle..."" I managed through my shaking voice.



Minnie sat beside me, pulling me close. ""Breathe deep and tell me everything.""



I followed her lead, my racing heart slowing under Minnie's calming presence. I hiccupped, another tear sliding down as I recounted the whole nightmare.



""Janelle? From your work?""



I nodded.



""How does she even know Marcus?""



""Through Cal, obviously,"" I sniffled.



""That fucking bitch. I can't believe she'd do that. And Marcus? Tonight of all nights?"" Minnie's voice climbed with fury.



My stomach twisted again. Tonight was supposed to be my career highlight. I'd finally scored the promotion, finally made it to news editor after breaking that massive story. I should've been celebrating with Marcus, marking a new chapter.



He'd destroyed our anniversary and now this too. I wasn't even sure I wanted to show up anymore.



""I'm staying home,"" I said aloud.



Minnie frowned. ""Like hell you are. You've worked your ass off for this position and you've earned this celebration."" She squeezed me tighter. ""Don't let him break you.""



""But—""



""No excuses,"" Minnie interrupted firmly. ""You're going to your party. Marcus isn't going to drag you down. You've earned this.""



""I've earned this,"" I repeated, though I didn't quite believe it yet.



Minnie stood up, her expression softening. She held out her hand. ""Come on, let's get you ready. Tonight's going to be amazing.""



I managed a weak smile as I reluctantly took her hand. Thoughts of Marcus and Janelle kept creeping in, but I shoved them aside.



Even though all I wanted was to cry myself to sleep, I refused to let those assholes ruin another second of my day.



So I followed Minnie to her bedroom, where we got ready. Two hours later, I was wearing a red dress with a thigh-high slit. Minnie had styled my brown hair in an elegant updo and done my makeup perfectly.



""You look absolutely stunning,"" Minnie said with a satisfied grin.



I studied my reflection, feeling more centered now.



""Yeah,"" I agreed.



""Let me get dressed too,"" Minnie said.



An hour later, we headed to Sector Freedom's VIP section.



Minnie, gorgeous in a sleek black dress, whispered behind me. ""I can't wait to see the setup, and that bitch's expression. You need to show her who's boss now, Elena.""



Minnie's words sparked something inside me, and my heart fluttered—not with pain this time, but with a hint of rebellion.



I would definitely show Janelle.



As we entered the VIP area, ice ran through my veins. My coworkers were already there, but instead of the welcoming faces I'd expected, I saw pitying stares and hushed conversations.



Was I imagining things?



""What's their problem?"" Minnie asked nervously.



The question made my stomach clench, but before I could answer, Janelle and Marcus emerged from across the room, fingers intertwined.



The pain slammed back—brutal and unforgiving in my chest.



Minnie found my hand, squeezing gently.



Before either of us could say anything, Cal stepped forward with a champagne flute in one hand and a microphone in the other.



""Thanks everyone for coming tonight,"" he started, his gaze finding mine and lingering. ""But there's been a change of plans. Tonight we're celebrating Janelle—she's our new editor. Congratulations, Nell.""

On the first date I got to her friends house, then she got to my house, then she got to my car, I drove her home and went to her flat. Later I joked if she has dates like that it's a miracle we still have both kidneys. We both had written in app we are dating long term.

Over those days we spent a lot of time together. I was the sweetest guy you could imagine, and were honestly focused to put smile on her face. The kind of ""I was at McDonald's, and I got you your favourite coffee unprompted"". Back rubs, drives her home from work etc. All of that on the same time was limited, to not overwhelm her (I also had my things to do). I can undoubtly say I was doing my best, and never lied. I've shown her my true colours.

She were talking how she likes me, how wonderful I am. She even slept at my house (no sex tho. She felt asleep at a couch during movie). She left her case with tovel, shower gel and clothes in my house cause she wanted to come back. She even brung me breakfast to my uni unprompted. On the last day she told me how I lighten up her shitty day, and how she will never get enough of me. She kissed me then she got a train to her parents house.

She ghosted me that day. Stopped replying to sms, doesn't answer phone, same on instagram and discord (she is active here tho) for over a week. Her clothes are still at my house.

I am not even sad (she isn't first one. Over 35 matches I got ghosted 34 times and rejected once. To girl who rejected me: Thanks for honesty) but who does things like that?

Can't you really trust nobody on apps? If you felt so good with me why cut it off? How am I supposed to believe anything my date says? Could people have at least enough respect to tell me things aren't working out, or to say I do something wrong?

Is there ANY indicator a girl actually likes guy, if it's not kissing, words and smacking my ass (I liked that. I felt desired)?

The Enduring Legacy of Resident Evil: A Survival Horror Saga

As winter settles in, there's no better time to dive into the chilling world of Resident Evil. This iconic franchise has not only defined the survival horror genre but has also evolved significantly since its inception. From its early days with fixed camera angles to the immersive first-person experiences of today, Resident Evil has left an indelible mark on gaming culture. Let's explore the history, core appeal, and why this series is perfect for winter gaming.

Brief History: The Evolution of Horror Games

Resident Evil first graced our screens in 1996, introducing players to a terrifying world filled with zombies and other grotesque creatures. The original game set the standard for survival horror with its fixed camera angles, creating a sense of dread and tension that was palpable. As technology advanced, so did the series. The transition to 3D graphics and first-person perspectives in titles like Resident Evil 7: Biohazard brought a new level of immersion, allowing players to experience fear in a more visceral way. Each installment has pushed the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay mechanics, ensuring that Resident Evil remains relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of horror games.

Core Appeal: Resource Management and Terrifying Encounters

What sets Resident Evil apart from other horror games is its unique blend of resource management, puzzle-solving, and terrifying encounters. Players must navigate through meticulously designed environments, often with limited ammunition and health supplies. This scarcity creates a palpable tension, forcing players to make strategic decisions about when to fight or flee. The puzzles, often intricately woven into the narrative, challenge players to think critically while under pressure. The combination of these elements not only heightens the sense of fear but also keeps players engaged, making each encounter with the undead feel fresh and exhilarating.

Why It's Perfect for Winter Gaming

Winter is the ideal season for cozying up with a good game, and Resident Evil fits the bill perfectly. The isolation and dread that permeate the series amplify the cold atmosphere outside, making the experience even more immersive. Picture yourself huddled under a blanket, controller in hand, as you navigate through dark, snow-covered landscapes filled with lurking horrors. The chilling sound design and eerie visuals create an ambiance that is hard to replicate, drawing players deeper into the narrative. Pairing these gaming sessions with a selection of scary beers can enhance the experience, making for a memorable winter gaming night.

Resident Evil gaming experience

As you prepare for your winter gaming sessions, consider revisiting the Resident Evil series. Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer, there's something for everyone in this survival horror saga. With its rich history, engaging gameplay, and perfect winter atmosphere, Resident Evil continues to be a staple in the gaming community. So grab your favorite scary beers, gather your friends, and get ready for a thrilling adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Top Pick #1: Resident Evil (Remake) – The Genesis of Fear

As winter settles in and the nights grow longer, there's no better time to dive into the chilling world of survival horror. Among the many titles in the genre, theResident Evilremake stands out as a definitive experience that every horror game enthusiast should explore. This classic not only redefined the genre but also set the stage for countless horror games that followed. Let’s delve into why this game is a must-play this winter.

Why it's a must-play

TheResident Evilremake is often hailed as the definitive survival horror experience. Its unparalleled atmosphere immerses players in the eerie and foreboding environment of the iconic Spencer Mansion. From the moment you step inside, the game envelops you in a sense of dread, with every creak of the floorboards and flicker of the lights heightening the tension. The meticulous attention to detail in the graphics and sound design creates a haunting ambiance that lingers long after you’ve put down the controller.

Key gameplay elements

What truly sets this remake apart are its key gameplay elements. The fixed camera angles add a layer of suspense, forcing players to navigate the mansion with limited visibility.
