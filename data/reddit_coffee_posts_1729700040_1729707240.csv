1gahba1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gahba1/why_is_it_that_id_consider_myself_pretty/,Why is it that id consider myself pretty confident until I just get random forms of anxiety? ,"I'll just be sat watching YouTube and then my brain is like ""you're doing your chosen subject for the rest of your life, what if this isnt the path you want"". Like wtf I feel like it is at least...

Another example is today, I was going to a new coffee shop to see if it was speciality and what its like, seeing as I'm in a new city. And as I approach it everything comes in. What if this isnt take away (even though it says it is) and I suddenly just freeze outside and I hav3 absolutely no idea why. I go from pretty confident about going to immediately getting these weird sudden breakouts. I walked to the counter and by the time I walked the 5 seconds there I was already covered in sweat. 

Why am I fucking like this? Im so happy and confident about something until my brain just decides to give me paranoia and fear about everything. And its always over the most pathetic things. Im so carefree all the time until I just randomly am not. Wtf is wrong with me. Ive always been quite anxious and lacking self conscious but in recent years I've been a lot more confident. I dont have an official diagnosis but even though I'm not depressed anymore, i still get anxiety attacks and flares just... whenever my brain says so. Is this anxiety or something else orr

Sorry, this post is more like a vent and a form of reassurance; I hope thats allowed. ",1,1729707045.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sick of : 1) being in that position, and 2). Hearing myself talking about it . Also, being in my head all the time ‚Ä¶. What are you going to do ? Where are you going to get more money ? Shit broke again you stupid fuck I‚Äôm not stupid yes you are or you wouldn‚Äôt be in this position of fuck off ‚Ä¶ yeah that‚Äôs the voices in my head 

I‚Äôm sick of it and just want to go on a long drive away from it all 

Sell it - no equity 

Let it go into foreclosure- I need a place to live 

Downsize - if I sell it I won‚Äôt have any money left to rent another place much less buy another house - I could rent out my house to cover the costs but then I would still need a place to live 

Can‚Äôt refinance I‚Äôm already at a low interest rate 

Side hustles - I think most of them in instagram or TikTok are overly exaggerated on how much money they really make 

So if I had a million in the bank what would I do : 

1) buy a small apartment or house outside of the US 

2) travel for a year across Europe 

3) rent of the whole house to cover the expenses and sell it when the market price will net me some equity money 

I need more coffee

Only eat beef chicken pork eggs butter ghee and beef tallow. I don't drink coffee and never drank coffee and I don't smoke drink at all and didn't even before the diet. I must be doing the diet wrong because for the last 4-5 months I've felt so tired every day. I feel like I can sleep the whole day if I wanted to and it's hard to stay awake. I also have diarrhea after every meal. I tried adding lots of fat to my meals too and it didn't change anything for me.  Before this diet I used to have tons of energy but now I feel like a zombie. The tiredness doesnt go away through the day eithe. I just am extremely fatigued the whole day. I really want my energy back and I'm so lost. Can't find any answers online or on YouTube. If anyone can help me I would be so thankful.  ,1,1729706808.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

I just recently bought a little container of shilajit and I have a couple questions I‚Äôd like to figure out before trying it. 

1. I take the following medications and am wondering if there are any known cross interactions, specifically I‚Äôm worried about the Adderall. In addition to what I listed below, I usually drink one cup of coffee a day. 
    - Adderall XR 30mg
    - Wellbutrin XR 150mg
    - Lexapro 5mg

2. How much should I scoop out, and how do you folks usually ingest it?

1gah57r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gah57r/aitah_for_rejecting_a_guy_after_he_cancelled_our/,AITAH for rejecting a guy after he cancelled our first date for 5 times?,"I met this really nice guy in an online literature club a few months ago, and the spark was instantly there. We started texting, and I was really optimistic when he suggested we should meet in person. We arranged everything (date, time, place and activity) over text and on the day he texted he was not feeling very well, so we rescheduled. The second time he said his dog died, and the third time he ghosted me when I asked if we were still in for Saturday. 

A few weeks later, he texted me again, apologizing and saying that the issue was him thinking that I was too good for him, and he was afraid that if we met in person, I would instantly hate him. He said he really liked me and begged for a second chance. Because I really enjoyed our conversations and we had similar taste in music, books and movies, as well as a similar lifestyle and attitude, I decided to give it another try.  He said he was insecure because of his speech impediment and also stated the fact that his family is a mess which is the main reason for his severe emotional baggage and unresolved intimacy issues. I encouraged him, and he promised he would make it up to me. We decided to meet for a coffee in a city park near his office, and 3 days before, I had some relatives visiting who stayed overnight, so I politely asked if we could reschedule. I cancelled all my other plans for that weekend so we could get together, and the day before the date, he told me he must go on a hiking trip with his sister. I was really pissed off  and this whole situation began to seem like a really cruel joke, but he apologized again, told me details about his relationship with his sister, and persuaded me to agree on another potential after-work drink. Finally, 30 minutes before he was supposed to pick me up from work, he called in sick AGAIN. At that point, I lost it and wrote that all of this was pointless and that I give up. He replied that he really liked me and wanted to do something special for our first date but got a fever the night before. Oh, and also that he is very disappointed in me for not believing him and that I broke his heart like no one else. 

The irony is that I think we could really make a great couple, but I had to draw a line at some point.

1gah4o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1gah4o4/are_successful_longterm_poly_relationships/,Are successful long-term poly relationships possible?,"I've been in some kind of relationship with a polyamorous person for the past two years, but it's been a rocky road for real! Unlike what I thought polyamory could be, it just feels restricting. There's so many rules and things I cannot do or that either he or his primary partner feel uncomfortable with (e.g. calling him, doing activities together other than drinking coffee and being intimate, meeting friends, him staying over, PDA, saying ""I love you"", going on trips, celebrating bdays/holidays together, talking to his partner etc.)

I like him a lot but it's also kinda exhausting... I see him, if I'm lucky, every month or maybe twice a month, but it's lonely and I wish I could share more experiences and moments with him. You know, the stuff I see my friends in couples doing...

So am I just not understanding enough of his boundaries? Do I have unrealistic expectations of poly relationships? Can poly relationships actually work (besides the people I see on social media?) especially long term? ",1,1729706592.0,NoStupidQuestions,8,0.99,False
1gah4kf,https://i.redd.it/f7xhc5oqpjwd1.jpeg,I think I might have a mental problem.,"Hey guys! 22 M here. 

I'd like to hear if someone has been dealing with some sort of eating disorder.

You know, I live alone by myself and I know how to cook, but the problem is that I've not been able to keep it up at a normal pace for over 3 years since I moved out from my mother's house, so, I I usually take 1 irregular meal per day, a few cups of coffee and some bread.

Everyday I gotta wake up early to sit on my desk but prior to that I am not even eager to grab some breakfast; I use my breaks to take naps whenever I can and when I end my shift I also take a nap, but even with naps I feel restless. I'd like to hire a cook but unfortunately my situation went worst when I lost my dream job 4 months ago.

I am trying to get a better job but I think this sort of problem or disorder is making me dumb, I can't even communicate properly with people anymore. Honestly I am so embarrassed because I don't even want to wash an apple, or to slice other fruits.... I don't understand why I just don't want to do it and I don't feel the need tho.

Last year, and earlier this year everything was fine with me, I used to slice some fruits everyday in the morning, have a couple of sandwiches, around 1 - 2 PM I used to cook soups and stews. Now I'm useless..... 

I wanted to include a picture of my last decent breakfast, it's a picture I shared with my mom because she always ask me if I had something to eat, my ex-girlfriend used to love my chilaquiles. I am feeling really down with all those memories, I feel miserable and sad of not having food in my stomach anymore.

My babywon‚Äôt nap I tried for 45 min and finally just let him nap on my shoulder just now. Sucks I have no one to relieve me so I can use bathroom or get a sip of coffee. Irritated cuz last night I told my husband we need to confirm his mom will watch the baby the day I go back to work since he plans on working that day and he blew up at me and said I could text her myself. she hardly responds to my texts and I reminded him it‚Äôs also his responsibility to secure childcare that day not just mine. And he kept saying I was pathetic and sad that I didn‚Äôt text her. I brought up that she had cancelled in the past when I needed her to babysit for an appointment so it‚Äôs important to make sure we have solutions to this and he stormed out of the room and kept acting angry. So feeling alone today trying to help my baby who is teething and in the regression and then feeling like I didn‚Äôt deserve that last night when I just wanted to be prepared for my first day back. üòû,1,1729706413.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

","AYEEE welcome to .. my post? To my life story? Idk welcome to‚Ä¶ ME! i know i know, so far it doesn't sound that exciting and more like that one strange uncle you see once a year during family events, that just keeps rambeling about aliens, the goverment, and how pigeons are goverment drones, but keep reading and you might just discover I'm actually your great uncle which went missing 10 years ago. (Or i can play him for 50‚Ç¨ only cash or bitcoin accepted.)

Either way I have heard from some very trustable sources on this subreddit that I should write down some of my hobbies as that's apparently what people do which are considered ""normal"", now im not the biggest fan of just writing everything about me down cause well THIS POST WOULD BECOME A BOOK,(best seller Material? Perhaps, bin Material... Perhaps)

But ill throw some of the basics in there: I love photography, i love filmmaking, nature(taking walks in it and just exploring and propably tripping and breaking my ankle because i have the stability of that one grandparent you thought would really be done after that last stair fall) watching youtube and netflix ,playing games, talking to new people aaand traveling, not because i'm wanted by multiple countries their secret services for a variety of crimes, including but not limited to the ilegal smuggeling of koalas, becvause thats not something id do, which is why im not wanted, really, trust me:)

I don't care about your gender or country but because of timezones i preffer it if your european (Not a must at all though BECAUSE I DO WORK THE NIGHTSHIFT WHICH MEANS MY SCHEDULE IS ALL OVER THE FLOOR) Overall I'm just a social fucking weirdo who always is looking for more people to talk to (NO I AM NOT ADDICTED...SORT OF) oh and German people especially RISE UP, I NEED Y'ALL TO PRACTICE MY GERMAN.

You don‚Äôt have to be a social expert at all, its more then okay if your a bit shy as long as your just actually interested in talking and not as dry as the ground in most of the world will be in a few more years (GOD DONT WE LOVE CLIMATE CHANGE ? I MISS SNOW DURING CHRISTMAS, I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE??) and even tho i love to fuck around and just have fun im also Always here for you if there is heavier stuff on your mind (i‚Äôm quite a good listner and Always try to help) .

I love bringing laughter into people their lives but ill also be your totally not certified in any way therapist(I WILL EVEN GIVE YOU SKITTLES AND CALL THEM SPECIAL ANTI DEPRESSANTS, LIKE EXCLUSIVE SHIT, HELL ILL EVEN TAKE YOUR HEALTHINSURANCE)

If id describe myself i‚Äôd say i‚Äôm.. Quite energetic, Always up for fun stuff and exploring, kind of shy at the start, caring, and hmmm. Fuck I CAN‚ÄôT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO ALWAYS STRUGGLES TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES RIGHT? Like I honestly find it diffecult xd. Like I'm the fucker that googles""personality traits"" and see what i relate with like some fucking quirky hippy in a coffee shop at 11am after taking too many shrooms the night beefore.

I am kind of feeling icky about it but at the same time 20 is a legal adult age. I think I mostly feel grossed out though. Guy that I do kind of like a bit wants to hangout a lot, and he is very friendly and chill but I feel some vibes of flirting. Yeah, I like his attention but at the same time I feel like he‚Äôs too old for me. I guess it‚Äôs a personal decision no matter what, but what would you think of it? Is it a red flag? I kind of feel like 24 should be my limit. I‚Äôve known him a couple of weeks now, I met him at a coffee shop that he works at. I started going there a lot before work to chill and we‚Äôd always make small talk, until one day he asked for my Instagram. I gave it to him because I do actually like talking to him and being around him. He looks around like 23-24 in my opinion, I was pretty shocked that he was 26. He also actually is friends with some of my coworkers, which is a crazy coincidence. Maybe this is all totally normally and I‚Äôm just being overly cautious, but I feel kind of afraid when I think about it",0,1729706372.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,0.5,False

‚Ä¢ never pays me for her Coffee/Food order when I pickup for the team

‚Ä¢ never asks if I want a Coffee/Food if she goes (only gets for herself)

‚Ä¢ wanted me to do her schoolwork/papers for online college

‚Ä¢ befriended me, called me all of the time, complimented, when I agreed to help her with schoolwork/papers 

‚Ä¢ stopped calling me when I said I can‚Äôt help her with college work because I have my own stress, and suggested her to pay somebody 

‚Ä¢ bought a mini cake for her birthday to be amicable. She left it in the work refrigerator for two days. Never touched it or offered it to anyone. I discarded it because it was expired and thought she didn‚Äôt want it since it sat there for two days. I bought an orchard as well, which she took home. 

She made a big uproar this morning, told everyone at work that I discarded the cake and said she was planning to have it today with everyone. Started dropping 10 names in leadership. I asked how could 10 people have eaten the small expired cake anyway (made for tiny slices to accommodate 6 people), she had all answers. She played the victim card and manipulated me to buy her two big cakes today to replace it. Two people show up for it. She complained about the selection. I asked her what kind (she said coconut and tiramisu) and I asked if she wanted chocolate as a substitute if they didn‚Äôt have (Door Dash says to do that). She said yes, but they ended up having the first selection. She complained in front of me because it was not chocolate. 

I grew up in an environment where I was gaslit a lot, and still learning through it. I recognize my responsibility for being a people pleaser. I really was just being a kind person.

I am being used right now, correct? Because I feel she is, and that she is a very selfish, ungrateful, fake mean girl type of person. Thanks everyone. ",1,1729706321.0,Life,3,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs My Take,"Alright, so clean water‚Äôs a must, and after trying a bunch of filters, I decided to test out the **Frizzlife Under Sink Water Filter** (spoiler: it's pretty solid). Here's what stood out and what you should know before grabbing one yourself.

# The Good Stuff:

**Easy Setup:** Look, I‚Äôm not exactly Bob the Builder, but this was a breeze to install‚Äîtook me less than an hour. No fancy tools, no calling in a plumber. Just twist a few things, and you‚Äôre done.

**Tastes Legit:** The water actually *tastes* clean, like, mountain-spring good. This thing filters out chlorine, lead, and all the other gross stuff but keeps the good minerals. Perfect for drinking, cooking, or making coffee that doesn‚Äôt taste like chemicals.

**Filter Lifespan:** One filter lasts *a whole year*‚Äîthat's 10,000 gallons of water. So you won‚Äôt be swapping out filters every month. When it‚Äôs time, just twist the old one off and twist the new one on. Super simple.

**Space Saver:** If you‚Äôre like me and your under-sink space is precious, this filter doesn‚Äôt hog it. You can still fit your cleaning supplies or whatever else under there without rearranging your life.

# A Few Cons:

**Waste Water:** The system does waste some water, which might be a downside if you‚Äôre super eco-conscious. Not a dealbreaker, but something to know.

**No Big-Name Certifications:** If you're the kind of person who *needs* to see official seals of approval from WQA or NSF, this might not be your jam. It claims it‚Äôs certified, but finding that info is a bit tricky.

**Potential for Leaks:** Some people have mentioned minor leaks if the fittings aren‚Äôt tightened properly. Just use plumber‚Äôs tape to be safe.

# Final Verdict:

The Frizzlife is affordable, easy to install, and does a killer job making your tap water taste great. If you're not fussed about official certifications and want something that works without breaking the bank, this one‚Äôs a solid option. Just make sure to tighten those fittings, and you're golden.

It's so embarrassing, my friend had to stop hard on the freeway, her boxes flew forward and sent my friends coffee everywhere. For seconds after I kept my hands up frozen where I had them when we stopped and absentmindedly sipping my frappuccino. Two separate times I opened the door to family coming home from their day at work, one time I paused and then screamed (SO EMBARRASSING), it felt completely involuntary. Today I opened the door to family coming home, paused and flinched so hard I inhaled a deep breath through my nose and mouth (like my face recoiled in the most dramatic way), again felt involuntary and was super embarrassed. I'm pretty sure this is a PTSD thing, I am also extremely hypervigilante and anxious at baseline and am in CBT therapy. Would that eventually help with this or something like EDMR? It sounds funny and I understand it's probably a natural reaction in the context of what my brain and nervous system have been through and how much trauma work I need to do but I feel so much shame after these instances happen. Like I try to prepare socially as best I can but this just feels compulsive and I don't want to do it at work accidentally. I live with my partners family, all very nice people but I just care too much about what they think so that amplifies the shame too",2,1729706191.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1gagxpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gagxpf/6_years_later_im_still_not_over_what_one_teacher/,"6 years later, I'm still not over what one teacher told me, and I hate that it still gets to me even today.","Not the spiciest of things, but I wanted to write it down still, if this is the right place to post it. Sorry for the length of this post, but I wanted to spill my guts out here. I (29M) am living what I think is my best life so far. I have an amazing fianc√©, we live in a cute appartment with our dog and don't worry about the housing crisis mortgage most people are dealing with, I have a wonderful family and friends, I've been working on my mental health after I learned I have ADHD and finally started to take control of it with pills, but more importantly are 2 things that I love about my life: I have an amazing job and work environment, and I'm working on loving myself more. 

I'm a teacher (in my 6th year) and I used to teach at the elementary level, but had doubts about the school I was in. Left a school 2 years ago with a somewhat toxic work place, the ""we're all one big family here"" type of environment, and I ended up taking a high school gig, which is where I realize I belong much more in. The team is amazing, people help me a lot, the students are generally well-behaved (the dream), and my principal last year even told me ""when I see you teach, you look like you're exactly where you're supposed to be"", which was the validation I never knew I needed, as you'll soon understand why. I even have a work wife bestie who I made at the previously mentionned toxic school, who coincidentally ended up at the same new school as me, which makes the job that much more fun. 

As for loving myself more, it's been my biggest thing I needed to work on in the last few years, and while I'm not there 100% yet, I'm at the best I've ever been. I have huge weight issues (I weighed 280 but lost 40 pounds in the last 6 months and I'm 5'6'') that I try to work on, not only by losing it but also trying to love my body and myself and trying not to view myself more beautiful the skinnier I get. It's very hard to do, but I'm getting there. Even my competencies as a teacher have improved, and I see myself so much better than before. I can acknowledge my flaws while working on them (classroom managment and being organized) while also not forgetting to praise myself for the things I'm good at and acknowledging them every so often also. In both physical health and especially mental health, I'm at a great spot.

Yet...for some reason, something pops up in my head from time to time, and I hate that it still affects me.

6 years ago, before I got my teaching degree, I had to do a final practicum (internship for teachers) for 3 months in a high school of my choice. You're usually associated with another teacher, take charge of half her groups, and try out teaching to them full time. In the meantime, the other teacher is supposed to watch you from time to time and evaluate you at the end of the 3 months. Let's call her Mrs.M. The grade Mrs.M would give me is the final grade I'd get for the practicum, and the University evaluator only intervenes with the final grade in very rare cases. That practicum was the most important one for me: it was the one future employers would look at if they needed to decide to hire me.

Mrs.M... was an absolute nightmare. 

And because I was very insecure about myself (and still am from time to time) and needed a good grade for the practicum, I always tried to be on her good side. As you can guess, it failed miserably. I won't detail everything she did, but here's a small checklist to give you an idea:

- Non-constructive criticism and very rare praises? Check

- Refused for me to observe HER in class because of vague reasons? Check

- Would tell me to improve my classroom managment by acting more often but would never give me details on what I should specifically do? Check

- Constant coffee breath? Check (not important, but it annoyed me so much)

- Often reveled about her previous intern while belitelling me the whole time? Check

- Made me completely scrap and have me redo an entire lesson plan an hour before a big project I was supposed to start with the students because according to her: ""the students had already done enough grammar"", therefore causing me to have my first real panic attack that subsequently triggered all the ones I would have in the future? Check

- Got angry at me for ""poorly explaining"" an evaluation, left the classroom angry in front of the students, left me to evaluate them on my own after promising she'd help out, didn't see her for the rest of the day and meeting up with her at the end of the day only for me to openly weep in front of her by apologizing for whatever I did that made her angry and her not apologizing for leaving me alone out of nowhere? 

Big fat check.

I'd keep going, but you get the idea. 3 months of intense anxiety, stress and torture.

At the end of it all, I was given the final grade of 67%. Yes, it is a passing grade, but for a practicum, it was devestating. I became one of the rare cases where the University supervisor had to actually boost the grade to a 72%, because even she couldn't understand how I could get such a grade after having observed me in 3 previous practicums.

Funny enough, that became the least of my problems.

Because when the time comes to be given your grade, your associated teacher sits down with you and goes over each competency she evaluated, explaining why she gave you the grade she did and giving details. We had 12 competencies to go over. You can imagine how dragged out it was with Mrs.M.

I honestly thought I couldn't feel worse for myself, but if Mrs.M was good at something, it was achieving exactly that. While I don't remember everything she said, there are two things she told me at the very end that gutted me so deeply, I'm almost certain I would've rather been stabbed irl. It's the words that still rings in my ears 6 years later. The first thing she told me was: ""I gave you the grade of 67% to be generous, but if it were up to me, I'd have failed you and have you redo the entire practicum from scratch. Even with this in mind, I'm not sure you'd actually be better by the end of your 2nd try."" The last thing she told me was the Mortal Kombat finisher she was keeping for the very end: ""You know, the first time we met before you started here, you told me that it was your #1 dream to become a teacher ever since you were 15 years old, that is was your purpose in life. I believe you have poor judgement skills, and you should re-evaluate your dreams and career choices.""

To say this was hurtful would be an understatement. It pretty much attacked my core values and my identity as a person. It took a while for me to get over this and not let it affect me, but it did make me seriously consider not becoming a teacher for a bit. And boy, am I glad I didn't go through with it and went on to teach.

I know I'm not perfect, but I can at least say that as teachers go, I'm not the worst one out there. I still have years to perfect my craft, but I consider myself a good teacher who's extremely passionate about what they do. now with more confidence under my belt and ADHD medication to help my organization skills, I'm the best version of myself so far, and happy to actually believe the words I say. I've had multiple positive validations since I've arrived at my new school, and the team here really appreciates me a lot. But every now and then, Mrs.M's words still ring in my head. She lives there rent free, and I'm so angry that I allow her to do so. It clearly shouldn't affect me as I'm doing a good job, but I hate that it still affects me from time to time, and it makes me feel worse about myself. I'm scared of ever seeing her again, even if I could prove her wrong about where I'm at today. If you've ever watched ""How I met your mother"", it's pretty much the exact same thing as the episode where Ted sees his old College professor who told him he'd never become an architect. My only hope is that one day, I don't let what she told me get to me, but it makes me scared that if after 6 years I still think about it, I'll never truly be over it. It makes me scared and angry and sad all at once.

TL:DR: My old teacher told me I wasn't cut out to be a teacher (my dream job), and 6 years later it still gets to me, even if my life is going well and I have my dream job as a high school teacher.",1,1729706128.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

# Top Categories to Focus on During Black Friday 2024

   * **Apple**: Historically, Apple products are discounted, though Apple‚Äôs own store offers minimal savings (rather, [Apple Store offers free gift cards on select products](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayRumors/comments/1deuh1t/apple_store_black_friday_2024_sale_ad_heres_what/)).

   * **Televisions**: Black Friday always brings massive price drops on TVs. Samsung‚Äôs 65-inch QLED 4K TV was discounted by $500 at Amazon and Best Buy, and LG‚Äôs 55-inch OLED TV was cut to just $999 at Walmart (down from $1,499).

1gagujv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1gagujv/34f_for_your_new_nerdy_best_friend_inquire_within/,34F üá∫üá∏ For your new nerdy best friend inquire within! üëΩ ,"I'm rather nerdy. I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I'm 28F who can easily spot handsome guys and quick to have crushes with potential husbands and future father to my kids. I've always been that kind of person who would imagine herself walking down the aisle in a simple yet sophisticated wedding gown. Imagining a life of abundance with future family.

And this is where it gets confusing.

I'm not generally attracted to women. I do have girl crushes, but don't all women do? Women who have somehow made a name for themselves in their own little ways in their little worlds. Women who I look up to, hoping that one day, I can also be that kind of person.

I don't easily get attracted with women. Matter of fact, I sometimes hate women cause there are some who are just too sensitive. Not being judgemental about it, but I refuse to deal with drama and intense levels of sensitivity. I also like keeping my personal space, so I feel annoyed when women I'm not close with sort of get too close physically. I have really close friends who can be clingy and I wouldn't mind. But that's also because I don't feel anything about it in particular.

But then there's this girl. I look at her. I like talking to her. I like having her around. I like laughing with her. I like getting coffee with her. I like going on walks with her. I generally like spending time with her, online or offline. I would sometimes imagine us together. The what ifs. What if I tell her how I really feel about her. What if we're more than just friends. What if we create a life together. What if we end uo becomeing lifetime partners. What if it all works out? I find myself thinking about all these what ifs a lot. I feel like a different person when I'm with her. I know for a fact that I treat her differently. 

Does it make sense? What do I do? I don't tell her how I feel because I don't think I'll be ready with either of the possible answers.

What if she doesn't feel the same way? We'll get awkward and we'll probably stop being friends. But what if she feels the same way? I'm not sure if I'd be able to stand my ground until the end. It's not that my side of the family would oppose, I don't think it would be a problem at all. I'm just scared that one day, I'd think that I no longer want this kind of relationship, and end up hurting her. ",1,1729705681.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

Tongue disorders can affect speech, feeding, and overall oral health. From infants to adults, tongue-related issues often require professional diagnosis and treatment. This article provides a comprehensive overview of common tongue disorders, their symptoms, causes, and how specialists‚Äîsuch as [**Tongue Tie Specialists Arizona**](https://www.agavepediatrics.com/tongue-tie) ‚Äîaddress these conditions to improve patients‚Äô quality of life.

# 1. Geographic Tongue

# What is Geographic Tongue?

Geographic tongue, also known as benign migratory glossitis, is a harmless condition where the tongue‚Äôs surface develops smooth, red patches with a white border. These patches resemble a map, giving the condition its name.

# Symptoms

* Irregular, smooth red patches on the tongue
* Mild discomfort or burning sensation, especially after eating spicy or acidic foods
* Patches that change location over time

# Causes

While the exact cause is unclear, contributing factors may include genetics, stress, hormonal changes, and irritation from certain foods. Some studies suggest a possible link between geographic tongue and autoimmune conditions.

# Treatment

Geographic tongue is generally harmless and often does not require treatment. However, specialists may recommend:

* Avoiding foods that trigger discomfort (e.g., spicy or acidic foods)
* Topical corticosteroids or antihistamine mouthwashes to ease inflammation and discomfort

# 2. Tongue-Tie (Ankyloglossia)

# What is Tongue-Tie?

Tongue-tie, or ankyloglossia, is a congenital condition where the tissue (lingual frenulum) connecting the underside of the tongue to the floor of the mouth is shorter or tighter than usual. This can restrict tongue movement, affecting breastfeeding, speech, and oral hygiene.

# Symptoms in Infants:

* Difficulty latching during breastfeeding
* Poor weight gain
* Frustration while nursing

# Symptoms in Older Children and Adults:

* Difficulty pronouncing certain sounds
* Oral hygiene problems due to restricted tongue mobility
* Inability to stick the tongue out past the lower front teeth

# Causes

Tongue-tie is typically a congenital condition that runs in families. It is present at birth and affects males more frequently than females.

# Diagnosis

[**Tongue Tie Phoenix**](https://www.agavepediatrics.com/tongue-tie) often diagnoses tongue-tie based on physical examination and a review of symptoms, particularly in newborns who experience difficulty breastfeeding.

# Treatment Options

The primary treatment for tongue-tie is a frenectomy‚Äîa simple surgical procedure that cuts the lingual frenulum to release the tongue. In infants, this is typically performed using scissors or a laser, with minimal discomfort and a quick recovery. For older children and adults, a more comprehensive surgical approach may be needed, especially if speech therapy is also required to retrain tongue movement.

# 3. Glossitis

# What is Glossitis?

Glossitis refers to inflammation of the tongue, which can result in swelling, redness, and changes in texture. It may be caused by infections, allergic reactions, or nutritional deficiencies.

# Symptoms

* Swollen tongue
* Pain or tenderness
* Changes in tongue color (red or pale)
* Difficulty chewing, swallowing, or speaking

# Causes

* Bacterial or viral infections (e.g., oral thrush)
* Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12 or iron)
* Allergic reactions to oral products, such as toothpaste or mouthwash

# Treatment

Treatment for glossitis depends on the underlying cause:

* Antibiotics or antifungal medications for infections
* Vitamin supplements for nutritional deficiencies
* Avoiding irritants (e.g., certain foods or oral products)

In more severe cases, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out underlying health issues, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders.

# 4. Fissured Tongue

# What is Fissured Tongue?

Fissured tongue is a benign condition characterized by deep grooves or fissures on the tongue's surface. These grooves can become irritated by trapped food and debris, causing discomfort or bad breath.

# Symptoms

* Deep grooves or cracks on the surface of the tongue
* Sensitivity to certain foods
* Bad breath due to trapped food particles

# Causes

Fissured tongue may be genetic or associated with certain conditions, such as Down syndrome, psoriasis, or Sj√∂gren‚Äôs syndrome. In some cases, it develops as part of the aging process.

# Treatment

While there is no cure for fissured tongue, proper oral hygiene is crucial to prevent food and bacteria from accumulating in the fissures. Specialists may recommend:

* Brushing the tongue gently
* Using an antiseptic mouthwash
* Regular dental check-ups

# 5. Burning Mouth Syndrome

# What is Burning Mouth Syndrome?

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic condition that causes a burning sensation on the tongue and other areas of the mouth. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be related to nerve damage, hormonal changes, or nutritional deficiencies.

# Symptoms

* A burning or scalding sensation on the tongue, lips, or entire mouth
* Dry mouth
* Altered taste (bitter or metallic)

# Causes

The causes of BMS are varied and can include:

* Hormonal changes (e.g., menopause)
* Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B or zinc)
* Nerve damage
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

# Treatment

Treating BMS is challenging, as it depends on addressing the underlying cause. Potential treatments include:

* Medications to relieve pain and discomfort (e.g., anticonvulsants, antidepressants)
* Nutritional supplements to correct deficiencies
* Saliva substitutes or medications to stimulate saliva production in cases of dry mouth

# 6. Black Hairy Tongue

# What is Black Hairy Tongue?

Black hairy tongue is a harmless condition caused by the buildup of dead skin cells on the tongue's surface, which can trap bacteria, food, and tobacco. These trapped particles give the tongue a dark, hairy appearance.

# Symptoms

* Dark, furry appearance on the tongue (ranging from black to brown or green)
* Bad breath
* Altered taste

# Causes

The condition is often linked to poor oral hygiene, tobacco use, excessive coffee or tea drinking, and the use of certain medications (e.g., antibiotics).

# Treatment

Improving oral hygiene is the most effective treatment. This includes:

* Regular brushing of the tongue
* Avoiding tobacco and staining beverages
* Increasing water intake

For more persistent cases, a healthcare professional may recommend using a tongue scraper or a prescription antimicrobial rinse.

I am a dentist who is remodeling a new clinic. In the waiting room I want to have a coffee bar, and my thought is to have a super automatic, so people could make coffee or milk drinks, and for it to be pretty point and click to use, but something a bit more upscale than just a Keurig. My research has drawn me to the Terra Kaffe TK-02, which looks very cool but I have a hard time finding good reviews on it. The other two that have drawn my eye are the Jura Ena 8 and the Miele 5310 Silence. 

I think my main desires are:
1. Ease of use and ease of maintenance
2. Variety of drinks including milk drinks 
3. As quiet as operation as possible
4. Nice looks

Some basic details below.

* Incomes: I make $56k/yr, she makes $52k/yr
* Debts: Her car, we owe $15k, $363 per month
* Cash & Assets: We have $28k in an HYSA, $25k in my Roth IRA.
* Mortgage Info:
   * Purchase Price = $290k, 5% down
   * Cash to Close = $11,500
   * Interest Rate = 6.75%
   * P & I = $1,800/mo
   * Property Taxes = $423/mo

Question at hand: Should we pay off J's car with money in our HYSA to drop our monthly bills, or dip into my Roth to help out with that to keep up our security blanket? In terms of the rate, it's not the best, we plan to eat the high rate until rates go down and refinance, but not sure if that is the answer or if we should just buy a bunch of points and not pay of J's car.

We appreciate any thoughts you may have, thank you in advance. I'll be happy to answer any questions for clarification.

Quitting caffeine was a mixed blessing. Here is a short list.
The good 
* no more diarrhea 
* Less sweating
* no more night terrors
* anxiety has lessened

The bad
* awfully vivid dreams every night. I wake up several times per night, but I fall asleep swiftly. Unfortunately the stupid dreams continue where I left off
* twitching in the lower right eyelid
* feeling low grade unease and fear (I guess this was present before and I was soothing it with caffeine)

The ugly
* I feel tired and depressed but it is more stable and bearable than the ups and downs of caffeine addiction. 
* I slipped up three times with coffee, cola and green tea and I hated it. I hope this negative reinforcement will keep me off the stuff.

https://reddit.com/link/1gagf68/video/h9eonc6lkjwd1/player

üéâ Drumroll please! Ikigai just hit another huge milestone today by getting listed on AscendEx! That‚Äôs right, folks‚Äîwe‚Äôve officially levelled up and joined the cool kids' table. This is our first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, and let me tell you, nothing says ‚Äúwe‚Äôve made it‚Äù like getting the CEXy stamp of approval! üöÄ

But wait, there‚Äôs more‚Äîoh yes, a lot more. Hold onto your sats because the Ikigai train is speeding ahead, and we‚Äôre taking the whole community with us (Lambo optional). Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cooking in the Ikigai ecosystem:

**Fiat Buy Option Added**

I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Äî‚ÄúBut, how do I get into this whole ‚Äòpurpose-driven meme coin‚Äô thing without a PhD in crypto?‚Äù Well, great news! We‚Äôve made it easier than explaining crypto to your grandma. You can now buy Ikigai directly with fiat on our website. No more jumping through crypto hoops like you‚Äôre auditioning for Cirque du Soleil‚Äîjust a few clicks, and boom! You‚Äôre in. It‚Äôs like buying pizza, but instead of pizza, you get purpose (and maybe a Lambo, fingers crossed).

**Transparency? We‚Äôve Got That in Spades!**

You know how most meme coins are like that mysterious neighbour you only see through the curtains? Not us! The entire Ikigai team is fully doxed. That‚Äôs right, no faceless avatars, no mysterious figures‚Äîjust real humans with real names and way too much caffeine. We‚Äôre working around the clock (seriously, do crypto people even sleep?) to bring you the goods. So if you‚Äôve ever wondered, ‚ÄúIs there a meme coin out there that isn‚Äôt just a dog in sunglasses?‚Äù Ikigai is the answer. Real team, real purpose, real passion‚Ä¶ and probably real coffee addictions.

**Ikigai: The Meme Coin with a Purpose (Yes, You Read That Right)**

We get it. Most meme coins are like sugar rushes‚Äîfun for a minute, then crash, burn, and leave you wondering what just happened. But not Ikigai. We‚Äôre here to introduce the world to purpose. We‚Äôre bringing Ikigai‚Äîthe Japanese philosophy of finding one‚Äôs reason for being‚Äîstraight to the blockchain. So, when people ask, ‚ÄúIs it a meme coin or a self-help guide?‚Äù You can proudly say, ‚ÄúBoth, baby!‚Äù We‚Äôre changing the game, one feature at a time, by proving you can have fun and meaning in one shiny crypto package. üöÄ

üî• **Upcoming Features: Because We‚Äôre Just Getting Started**

Staking? Check. Lottery? Check. That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre rolling out staking and lottery options because let‚Äôs face it‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt like earning passive income while dreaming about winning big? It‚Äôs like putting your money to work, but with a side of adrenaline. Soon, you‚Äôll have more reasons to cuddle‚ÄîI mean, hodl‚ÄîIkigai than ever before!

And don‚Äôt even get me started on our upcoming SPL 404 NFTs! These bad boys are going to combine NFT fun with the deep meaning Ikigai stands for. It‚Äôs like art that looks cool and makes you feel like you‚Äôve achieved enlightenment at the same time. Who knew you could be a crypto investor and an art connoisseur in one go?

**The Ikigai Community: Where Memes Meet Mission**

Here‚Äôs where things get really special. What sets Ikigai apart isn‚Äôt just our features‚Äîit‚Äôs you. That‚Äôs right, our community is like a superhero squad, but instead of capes, you‚Äôve got memes, and instead of fighting crime, we‚Äôre fighting aimlessness. Every day we‚Äôre growing, laughing, and making this movement stronger. Plus, we‚Äôre dropping regular content on X (formerly Twitter, but you know the drill) that‚Äôll keep you entertained, from hilarious videos to weekly comics that remind you that crypto can actually be fun.

**Get Involved: It‚Äôs Like Joining a Cult, but With More Purpose**

Whether you‚Äôre a crypto veteran or just stumbled in here because of the meme coin hype, Ikigai is the project for you. We‚Äôve got transparency, a killer roadmap, and we‚Äôre constantly cooking up new features. Plus, you can actually say we‚Äôre a meme coin with a straight face because, you know‚Ä¶ we have a purpose.

Check out the latest updates, laugh with us, cry when the market dips (but in a healthy, purposeful way), and join the movement that‚Äôs taking crypto from Lambo memes to life goals:

I (23F) struggled w friendships till the past year or 2 when I started to really come out of my shell. In Tampa, where I am from, I was able to build myself a nice community of friends through Kava bars and pole dancing classes but after I moved I haven‚Äôt been able to do the same. 

Right now, my friends include my boyfriends co-workers.  He is a medical resident, his class size is huge and they mingle w other specialties/yrs so the pool of people is expansive and not always directly friends w my bf. I adore almost if not all of his co-residents/friends and have so much fun with when we go out and am invited to things like bookclub, workout classes, birthdays etc but I don‚Äôt want to just be a part of what my partner has already established, I want my own.

I‚Äôve been going to coffee shops around downtown, where I am located, and pole classes throughout the city but nothing has been fruitful as far as friendships. I went to Kavahana a few weeks ago and met someone that owns a Muay Thai gym in Santa Monica and have been going there a few times a week, which I love. But as a woman that has been in fighting sports all my life, I know this doesn‚Äôt help me on this front. There are 4 women that attend my gym. They are very nice but usually older than me by at least 10 yrs and have families. 

Any suggestions on places/activities? I love such a wide array of things but I think I do need some aspect of ruggedness but still soft. 

Some other things about me in case it helps to make suggestions. I‚Äôm in school to be a mental health counselor, I like the arts and crafting, cooking/baking. The shows I‚Äôm watching right now are Hacks, the Penguin, and catching up on FTWD out of childhood nostalgia. My favorite musical artists are Mitski, Fiona Apple, The Neighbourhood, and Lana.

I was the victim of a hit and run on my way to work almost a month ago. I was transported to the ER because my head was numb and I have some back issues. The police were no help and no one has any footage. The car is over 10 years old and I knew it was totaled. Took it to the most reputable shop in the area and got an estimate for $10.2k. Insurance had me send photos of the car and said that there was only $2700 in damage, refusing me a rental. They sent a check for $2200 and we obviously fought it. I had to take it to another shop and got an estimate  for $10.6k. Insurance said they would pay $10.2 to total it. I got a rental 2 weeks later. THEN they turn around and tell my mom that they have until my birthday (a month from now) to get me off of their insurance or they would be dropping them. They claim that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt live in PA‚Äù. I‚Äôm 24 and grew up in WV. My mom moved to PA when I was 18 but I didn‚Äôt change my address because I was going to college in WV and knew I would have to change my ID soon enough. After graduation (2023), I moved to PA full-time and changed the ID. I‚Äôm taking graduate classes in PA, I have a job in PA, all medical bills go to PA, and I‚Äôm registered to vote in PA. However, my fianc√© and I are slowly renovating a house near our alma mater so I have been staying in WV to help. I picked up a job at a local coffee shop to kill time while my fianc√© is at work. The house we are working on is still uninhabitable and he lives down the street at his mom‚Äôs. As for injuries, I have a sprained neck and the pain has spread down my back from trying to compensate. I‚Äôm in treatment 2x a week (should be 3 but it‚Äôs a 45 minute drive). They wont return any calls and the totaled car is still sitting in his mom‚Äôs yard. They also insisted that we had to get the car to PA (1.5 hr drive) in order to be picked up. The car is unsafe to drive and shakes over 55mph. I only have the rental for 2 more weeks. Advice?

We‚Äôre RVA Pieces, The Richmond Chess Club! We meet every Monday at Gwar (6:00-late) and Thursday at Home Sweet Home in Carytown (7:00-late). 
We‚Äôll be in Monroe park on Saturdays at 1:00-4:00 but only for a couple more weeks, as it‚Äôs getting cold. 

Starting Saturday Nov 9th, and every Saturday moving forward until April, we will be holding a Free Library Chess Class for beginners and intermediate players of ALL AGES at the Main Library on Franklin downstairs in the Annex Room from 1:00-3:30. Students can expect around an hour of classroom style chess instruction from one of our several coaches, followed by free casual play. (The library is closed Saturday Nov 16!)

For the seasoned chess nerds looking for officially rated USCF events, starting Wednesday Nov 6, and every other Wednesday (so just check our calendar) we will be hosting a rated ladder event at the Publix at White Oak from 6:00pm-10:00pm, where players will play one slow USCF rated game (60 mins per side, 10 second delay per move). $5 entry, USCF registration required (you can do this when you show up if you aren‚Äôt already registered, it‚Äôs $20 a year for kids 19 and under, $27 a year for young adults 24 and under, and $45 a year for adults.)
Come get some serious tournament practice!

Last thing-

This October marks the TEN YEAR anniversary of our club. We‚Äôve come from meeting just once a week to 3 times a week + Backyard Tournaments, First Fridays, free beginner classes, and now a biweekly rated ladder on top of our monthly Gallery 5 game night. Along the way, we‚Äôve gained a thousand followers on Instagram and 500 hooligans on Discord. Biggest of all, we‚Äôve secured our 501c3 non profit status, a goal we‚Äôve had for many years. Huge thank you to the law firm of Troutman Pepper for guiding us very gracefully through the whole process. With our non profit status, our ultimate dream of opening a store front chess/coffee shop is actually starting to become something we can start to work towards. 

Through the month of October, we will be fundraising in efforts to actually pay our coaches, tournament directors, photographers, and now grant writers. This will also fund us buying boards and clocks, stickers and tshirts as well. We‚Äôll be hosting a raffle on Monday October 28th at GWAR Bar, woo!

All our coaching and tournament directing has been done out of pure love up to this point, so if you can afford to throw us a bone we‚Äôll be forever grateful. In the future, with your support and hopefully a healthy amount of grants, we could be on our way to having a real brick and mortar chess space here in Richmond! Thank you to everyone who has been a part of the Richmond chess experience these past ten years, here‚Äôs to fifty more! ü•≥

We are above a very popular cafe too so there's lots of traffic in the morning and only about 20 parking spots. Our city is poorly designed. 


I ran out for a 40min errand this morning and saw 2 SUVs waiting to enter the parking lot as I left. When I came back, the 2 SUVs were parked wayyy over the lines and taking up two parking spots each- 4 total. This left me with no parking which I admit was irritating. Also, they were there for at least 30 minutes! If they pulled up like that to pick up a coffee and leave I wouldn't have been as bothered, but no they sat down to eat.


My bf complains about someone who frequently parks on top of the line like that, so I took a picture of the vehicles to text him and ask if he recognized either as the serial asshole (lol). Right after I snapped the picture, 2 people leaving the cafe came up to me and angrily asked what I was doing. 


I said I was ""taking a picture of their shitty parking"" and started walking away to my apartment. One yelled at me that I can't do that because it's stalking and an invasion of their privacy. I said ""No it's not, don't be an asshole next time"" and went inside. As I closed the door behind me I heard them yell ""YOU'RE THE FUCKING ASSHOLE, CREEP"".


 I showed the picture to my friend and relayed the story because honestly, I think it's funny. My friend told me that they were dicks but I also shouldn't have taken a picture. I've already deleted it and I don't plan on sharing it with anyone else or putting it on social media, so I don't see a problem with it. My friend said that those people are probably scared I'll try to start a witch hunt on social media and that I made them feel unsafe because they're female.

1gafvp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KayaTax1/comments/1gafvp9/bookkeepers_know_where_you_stand_financially/,Bookkeepers - Know Where You Stand Financially!,"In the world of business, keeping track of financial transactions is essential. Whether you run a small business or a large enterprise, the one thing that remains critical is knowing where you stand financially. This is where **bookkeeping services in California** come into play ‚Äì a process of meticulously recording every financial activity to ensure your business remains on solid ground.

**What Is Bookkeeping?**

Bookkeeping refers to the systematic process of recording all the financial transactions in your business. From sales, purchases, and receipts to payments, bookkeeping ensures that every monetary movement is captured. Whether it‚Äôs a coffee purchase for a team meeting or a large client invoice, every transaction is essential in understanding your financial position. The data captured through bookkeeping serves as the foundation for producing crucial financial reports such as profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.

**Why Is Bookkeeping Important?**

Effective bookkeeping provides clarity on your business's financial health. By maintaining accurate and up-to-date records, you can easily identify where your money is coming from and where it‚Äôs going. This clarity is essential for managing cash flow, ensuring you have enough funds to cover expenses and identifying growth opportunities.

Moreover, **bookkeeping aids** in tax preparation. When tax season arrives, organized financial records will save you from the stress of scrambling for receipts and invoices. It ensures compliance with legal obligations, keeping your business safe from potential penalties.

**Financial Insights**

One of the most significant advantages of consistent bookkeeping is the financial insights it provides. By having an accurate picture of your finances, you can make informed decisions about your business. For example, if you notice an increase in expenses, you can identify which areas need adjustment. If your revenue is higher than expected, you may decide to reinvest in marketing or hire new staff.

Bookkeeping also enables you to spot trends over time. Are sales increasing or decreasing during certain months? Is a particular product or service performing better than others? These insights can help shape future business strategies and ensure that you stay on track with your financial goals.

**Simplifying the Process**

While bookkeeping might seem like a daunting task, especially for small business owners with many other responsibilities, various tools can make the process easier. From traditional methods like spreadsheets to advanced accounting software, keeping records has never been more manageable. 

Finally, [bookkeeping services in California](https://www.kayatax.com) are not just about recording numbers; it's about understanding your business's financial position. In the long run, diligent bookkeeping can lead to a healthier, more profitable business, giving you the confidence to grow and succeed.

For some time they had predicted that the heat of the eruption could detach the eternal ice from the slopes of the volcano, but no one heeded their warnings; they sounded like the tales of frightened old women. The towns in the valley went about their daily life, deaf to the moaning of the earth, until that fateful Wednesday night in November when a prolonged roar announced the end of the world, and walls of snow broke loose, rolling in an avalanche of clay, stones, and water that descended on the villages and buried them beneath unfathomable meters of telluric vomit. As soon as the survivors emerged from the paralysis of that first awful terror, they could see that houses, plazas, churches, white cotton plantations, dark coffee forests, cattle pastures‚Äîall had disappeared. Much later, after soldiers and volunteers had arrived to rescue the living and try to assess the magnitude of the cataclysm, it was calculated that beneath the mud lay more than twenty thousand human beings and an indefinite number of animals putrefying in a viscous soup. Forests and rivers had also been swept away, and there was nothing to be seen but an immense desert of mire.

When the station called before dawn, Rolf Carl√© and I were together. I crawled out of bed, dazed with sleep, and went to prepare coffee while he hurriedly dressed. He stuffed his gear in the green canvas backpack he always carried, and we said goodbye, as we had so many times before. I had no presentiments. I sat in the kitchen, sipping my coffee and planning the long hours without him, sure that he would be back the next day.  

He was one of the first to reach the scene, because while other reporters were fighting their way to the edges of that morass in jeeps, bicycles, or on foot, each getting there however he could, Rolf Carl√© had the advantage of the television helicopter, which flew him over the avalanche. We watched on our screens the footage captured by his assistant‚Äôs camera, in which he was up to his knees in muck, a microphone in his hand, in the midst of a bedlam of lost children, wounded survivors, corpses, and devastation. The story came to us in his calm voice. For years he had been a familiar figure in newscasts, reporting live at the scene of battles and catastrophes with awesome tenacity. Nothing could stop him, and I was always amazed at his equanimity in the face of danger and suffering; it seemed as if nothing could shake his fortitude or deter his curiosity. 

Fear seemed never to touch him, although he had confessed to me that he was not a courageous man, far from it. I believe that the lens of the camera had a strange effect on him; it was as if it transported him to a different time from which he could watch events without actually participating in them. When I knew him better, I came to realize that this fictive distance seemed to protect him from his own emotions. 

Rolf Carl√© was in on the story of Azucena from the beginning. He filmed the volunteers who discovered her, and the first persons who tried to reach her; his camera zoomed in on the girl, her dark face, her large desolate eyes, the plastered-down tangle of her hair. The mud was like quicksand around her, and anyone attempting to reach her was in danger of sinking. They threw a rope to her that she made no effort to grasp until they shouted to her to catch it; then she pulled a hand from the mire and tried to move, but immediately sank a little deeper. Rolf threw down his knapsack and the rest of his equipment and waded into the quagmire, commenting for his assistant‚Äôs microphone that it was cold and that one could begin to smell the stench of corpses.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù he asked the girl, and she told him her flower name. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move, Azucena,‚Äù Rolf Carl√© directed, and kept talking to her, without a thought for what he was saying, just to distract her, while slowly he worked his way forward in mud up to his waist. The air around him seemed as murky as the mud. 

It was impossible to reach her from the approach he was attempting, so he retreated and circled around where there seemed to be firmer footing. When finally he was close enough, he took the rope and tied it beneath her arms, so they could pull her out. He smiled at her with that smile that crinkles his eyes and makes him look like a little boy; he told her that everything was fine, that he was here with her now, that soon they would have her out. He signaled the others to pull, but as soon as the cord tensed, the girl screamed. They tried again, and her shoulders and arms appeared, but they could move her no farther; she was trapped. Someone suggested that her legs might be caught in the collapsed walls of her house, but she said it was not just rubble, that she was also held by the bodies of her brothers and sisters clinging to her legs.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll get you out of here,‚Äù Rolf promised. Despite the quality of the transmission, I could hear his voice break, and I loved him more than ever. Azucena looked at him, but said nothing.

During those first hours Rolf Carl√© exhausted all the resources of his ingenuity to rescue her. He struggled with poles and ropes, but every tug was an intolerable torture for the imprisoned girl. It occurred to him to use one of the poles as a lever but got no result and had to abandon the idea. He talked a couple of soldiers into working with him for a while, but they had to leave because so many other victims were calling for help. The girl could not move, she barely could breathe, but she did not seem desperate, as if an ancestral resignation allowed her to accept her fate. The reporter, on the other hand, was determined to snatch her from death. Someone brought him a tire, which he placed beneath her arms like a life buoy, and then laid a plank near the hole to hold his weight and allow him to stay closer to her. As it was impossible to remove the rubble blindly, he tried once or twice to dive toward her feet, but emerged frustrated, covered with mud, and spitting gravel. He concluded that he would have to have a pump to drain the water, and radioed a request for one, but received in return a message that there was no available transport and it could not be sent until the next morning. 

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait that long!‚Äù Rolf Carl√© shouted, but in the pandemonium no one stopped to commiserate. Many more hours would go by before he accepted that time had stagnated and reality had been irreparably distorted. 

A military doctor came to examine the girl, and observed that her heart was functioning well and that if she did not get too cold she could survive the night.

‚ÄúHang on, Azucena, we‚Äôll have the pump tomorrow,‚Äù Rolf Carl√© tried to console her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me alone,‚Äù she begged.

‚ÄúNo, of course I won‚Äôt leave you.‚Äù

Someone brought him coffee, and he helped the girl drink it, sip by sip. The warm liquid revived her and she began telling him about her small life, about her family and her school, about how things were in that little bit of world before the volcano had erupted. She was thirteen, and she had never been outside her village. Rolf Carl√©, buoyed by a premature optimism, was convinced that everything would end well: the pump would arrive, they would drain the water, move the rubble, and Azucena would be transported by helicopter to a hospital where she would recover rapidly and where he could visit her and bring her gifts. He thought, She‚Äôs already too old for dolls, and I don‚Äôt know what would please her; maybe a dress. I don‚Äôt know much about women, he concluded, amused, reflecting that although he had known many women in his lifetime, none had taught him these details. To pass the hours he began to tell Azucena about his travels and adventures as a newshound, and when he exhausted his memory, he called upon imagination, inventing things he thought might entertain her. From time to time she dozed, but he kept talking in the darkness, to assure her that he was still there and to overcome the menace of uncertainty.

That was a long night.

Many miles away, I watched Rolf Carl√© and the girl on a television screen. I could not bear the wait at home, so I went to National Television, where I often spent entire nights with Rolf editing programs. 

There, I was near his world, and I could at least get a feeling of what he lived through during those three decisive days. I called all the important people in the city, senators, commanders of the armed forces, the North American ambassador, and the president of National Petroleum, begging them for a pump to remove the silt, but obtained only vague
promises. I began to ask for urgent help on radio and television, to see if there wasn‚Äôt someone who could help us. Between calls I would run to the newsroom to monitor the satellite transmissions that periodically brought new details of the catastrophe. While reporters selected scenes with most impact for the news report, I searched for footage that featured Azucena‚Äôs mudpit. 

The screen reduced the disaster to a single plane and accentuated the tremendous distance that separated me from Rolf Carl√©; nonetheless, I was there with him. 

The child‚Äôs every suffering hurt me as it did him; I felt his frustration, his impotence. Faced with the impossibility of communicating with him, the fantastic idea came to me that if I tried, I could reach him by force of mind and in that way give him encouragement. I concentrated until I was dizzy‚Äîa frenzied and futile activity. At times I would be overcome with compassion and burst out crying; at other times, I was so drained I felt as if I were staring through a telescope at the light of a star dead for a million years.

I watched that hell on the first morning broadcast, cadavers of people and animals awash in the current of new  rivers formed overnight from the melted snow. Above the mud rose the tops of trees and the bell towers of a church where several people had taken refuge and were patiently awaiting rescue teams. Hundreds of soldiers and volunteers from the Civil Defense were clawing through rubble searching for survivors, while long rows of ragged specters awaited their turn for a cup of hot broth. Radio networks announced that their phones were jammed with calls from families offering shelter to orphaned children. Drinking water was in scarce supply, along with gasoline and food. Doctors, resigned to amputating arms and legs without anesthesia, pled that at least they be sent serum and painkillers and antibiotics; most of the roads, however, were impassable, and worse were the bureaucratic obstacles that stood in the way. To top it all, the clay contaminated by decomposing bodies threatened the living with an outbreak of epidemics.

Azucena was shivering inside the tire that held her above the surface. Immobility and tension had greatly weakened her, but she was conscious and could still be heard when a microphone was held out to her. Her tone was humble, as if apologizing for all the fuss. Rolf Carl√© had a growth of beard, and dark circles beneath his eyes; he looked near exhaustion. Even from that enormous distance I could sense the quality of his weariness, so different from the fatigue of other adventures. He had completely forgotten the camera; he could not look at the girl through a lens any longer. The pictures we were receiving were not his assistant‚Äôs but those of other reporters who had appropriated Azucena, bestowing on her the pathetic responsibility of embodying the horror of what had happened in that place. 

With the first light Rolf tried again to dislodge the obstacles that held the girl in her tomb, but he had only his hands to work with; he did not dare use a tool for fear of injuring her. He fed Azucena a cup of the cornmeal mush and bananas the Army was distributing, but she immediately vomited it up. A doctor stated that she had a fever, but added that there was little he could do: Antibiotics were being reserved for cases of gangrene. A priest also passed by and blessed her, hanging a medal of the Virgin around her neck. By evening a gentle, persistent drizzle began to fall.

‚ÄúThe sky is weeping,‚Äù Azucena murmured, and she, too, began to cry.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid,‚Äù Rolf begged. ‚ÄúYou have to keep your strength up and be calm. Everything will be fine. I‚Äôm with you, and I‚Äôll get you out somehow.‚Äù

Reporters returned to photograph Azucena and ask her the same questions, which she no longer tried to answer. In the meanwhile, more television and movie teams arrived with spools of cable, tapes, film, videos, precision lenses, recorders, sound consoles, lights, reflecting screens, auxiliary motors, cartons of supplies, electricians, sound technicians, and cameramen: Azucena‚Äôs face was beamed to millions of screens around the world. And all the while Rolf Carl√© kept pleading for a pump. The improved technical facilities bore results, and National Television began receiving sharper pictures and clearer sound; the distance seemed suddenly compressed, and I had the horrible sensation that Azucena and Rolf were by my side, separated from me by impenetrable glass. I was able to follow events hour by hour; I knew everything my love did to wrest the girl from her prison and help her endure her suffering; I overheard fragments of what they said to one another and could guess the rest; I was present when she taught Rolf to pray, and when he distracted her with the stories I had told him in a thousand and one nights beneath the white mosquito netting of our bed. 

When darkness came on the second day, Rolf tried to sing Azucena to sleep with old Austrian folk songs he had learned from his mother, but she was far beyond sleep. They spent most of the night talking, each in a stupor of exhaustion and hunger, and shaking with cold. That night, imperceptibly, the unyielding floodgates that had contained Rolf Carl√©‚Äôs past for so many years began to open, and the torrent of all that had lain hidden in the deepest and most secret layers of memory poured out, leveling before it the obstacles that had blocked his consciousness for so long. He could not tell it all to Azucena; she perhaps did not know there was a world beyond the sea or time previous to her own; she was not capable of imagining Europe in the years of the war. So he could not tell her of defeat, nor of the afternoon the Russians had led them to the concentration camp to bury prisoners dead from starvation. Why should he describe to her how the naked bodies piled like a mountain of firewood resembled fragile china? How could he tell this dying child about ovens and gallows? Nor did he mention the night that he had seen his mother naked, shod in stiletto-heeled red boots, sobbing with humiliation.

There was much he did not tell, but in those hours he relived for the first time all the things his mind had tried to erase. Azucena had surrendered her fear to him and so, without wishing it, had obliged Rolf to confront his own.

There, beside that hellhole of mud, it was impossible for Rolf to flee from himself any longer, and the visceral terror he had lived as a boy suddenly invaded him.

He reverted to the years when he was the age of Azucena, and younger, and, like her, found himself trapped in a pit without escape, buried in life, his head barely above ground; he saw before his eyes the boots and legs of his father, who had removed his belt and was whipping it in the air with the never-forgotten hiss of a viper coiled to strike. Sorrow flooded through him, intact and precise, as if it had lain always in his mind, waiting. He was once again in the armoire where his father locked him to punish him for imagined misbehavior, there where for eternal hours he had crouched with his eyes closed, not to see the darkness, with his hands over his ears, to shut out the beating of his heart, trembling, huddled like a cornered animal. Wandering in the mist of his memories he found his sister Katharina, a sweet, retarded child who spent her life hiding, with the hope that her father would forget the disgrace of her having been born. With Katharina, Rolf crawled beneath the dining room table, and with her hid there under the long white tablecloth, two children forever embraced, alert to footsteps and voices. Katharina‚Äôs scent melded with his own sweat, with aromas of cooking, garlic, soup, freshly baked bread, and the unexpected odor of putrescent clay. 

His sister‚Äôs hand in his, her frightened breathing, her silk hair against his cheek, the candid gaze of her eyes. Katharina . . . Katharina materialized before him, floating on the air like a flag, clothed in the white tablecloth, now a winding sheet, and at last he could weep for her death and for the guilt of having abandoned her. He understood then that all his exploits as a reporter, the feats that had won him such recognition and fame, were merely an attempt to keep his most ancient fears at bay, a stratagem for taking refuge behind a lens to test whether reality was more tolerable from that perspective. 

He took excessive risks as an exercise of courage, training by day to conquer the monsters that tormented him by night. But he had come face to face with the moment of truth; he could not continue to escape his past. He was Azucena; he was buried in the clayey mud; his terror was not the distant emotion of an almost forgotten childhood, it was a claw sunk in his throat. In the flush of his tears he saw his mother, dressed in black and clutching her imitation-crocodile pocketbook to her bosom, just as he had last seen her on the dock when she had come to put him on the boat to South America. She had not come to dry his tears, but to tell him to pick up a shovel: the war was over and now they must bury the dead.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry. I don‚Äôt hurt anymore. I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Azucena said when dawn came.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crying for you,‚Äù Rolf Carl√© smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm crying for myself. I hurt all over.‚Äù

The third day in the valley of the cataclysm began with a pale light filtering through storm clouds. The President of the Republic visited the area in his tailored safari jacket to confirm this was the worst catastrophe of the century; the country was in mourning; sister nations had offered aid; he had ordered a state of siege; the Armed Forces would be merciless, anyone caught stealing or committing other offenses would be shot on sight. 

He added that it was impossible in response to the disaster to remove all the corpses or count the thousands who had disappeared; the entire valley would be declared holy ground, and bishops would come to celebrate a solemn mass for the souls of the victims. He went to the Army field tents to offer relief in the form of vague promises to crowds of the rescued, then to the improvised hospital to offer a word of encouragement to doctors and nurses worn down from so many hours of tribulations.

Then he asked to be taken to see Azucena, the little girl the whole world had seen. He waved to her with a limp statesman‚Äôs hand, and microphones recorded his emotional voice and paternal tone as he told her that her courage had served as an example to the nation. Rolf Carl√© interrupted to ask for a pump, and the President assured him that he personally would attend to the matter. I caught a glimpse of Rolf for a few seconds kneeling beside the mudpit. On the evening news broadcast, he was still in the same position; and I, glued to the screen like a fortuneteller to her crystal ball, could tell that something fundamental had changed in him. I knew somehow that during the night his defenses had crumbled and he had given in to grief; finally he was vulnerable. The girl had touched a part of him that he himself had no access to, a part he had never shared with me. Rolf had wanted to console her, but it was Azucena who had given him consolation.

I recognized the precise moment at which Rolf gave up the fight and surrendered to the torture of watching the girl die.

I was with them, three days and two nights, spying on them from the other side of life. I was there when she told him that in all her thirteen years no boy had ever loved her and that it was a pity to leave this world without knowing love. Rolf assured her that he loved her more than he could ever love anyone, more than he loved his mother, more than his sister, more than all the women who had slept in his arms, more than he loved me, his life companion, who would have given anything to be trapped in that well in her place, who would have exchanged her life for Azucena‚Äôs, and I watched as he leaned down to kiss her poor forehead, consumed by a sweet, sad emotion he could not name. I felt how in that instant both were saved from despair, how they were freed from the clay, how they rose above the vultures and helicopters, how together they flew above the vast swamp of corruption and laments. How, finally, they were able to accept death. Rolf Carl√© prayed in silence that she would die quickly, because such pain cannot be borne.

By then I had obtained a pump and was in touch with a general who had agreed to ship it the next morning on a military cargo plane. But on the night of that third day, beneath the unblinking focus of quartz lamps and the lens of a hundred cameras, Azucena gave up, her eyes locked with those of the friend who had sustained her to the end. Rolf Carl√© removed the life buoy, closed her eyelids, held her to his chest for a few moments, and then let her go. She sank slowly, a flower in the mud.

You are back with me, but you are not the same man. I often accompany you to the station and we watch the videos of Azucena again; you study them intently, looking for something you could have done to save her, something you did not think of in time. 

Or maybe you study them to see yourself as if in a mirror, naked. Your cameras lie forgotten in a closet; you do not write or sing; you sit long hours before the window, staring at the mountains. Beside you, I wait for you to complete the voyage into yourself, for the old wounds to heal. I know that when you return from your nightmares, we shall again walk hand in hand, as before.

1gafsqp,https://i.redd.it/s6m4jio1gjwd1.png,üéÉ Happy Halloween! The spooky season is already here!üéÉ ,"üëπ Tributress is the embodiment of taxes. The giant eye on top of her head is always watching, never missing a thing. Her hair is made of endless receipts, wrapping around her like a constant reminder that your debt to her never ends. And what about the wires on her arms? Yeah, they're here to squeeze every last bit of freedom out of you.

üòà Work Warden is the nightmare of non-stop work. He's got antennae, like some creepy insect, always sensing whenever you try to take a break, pulling you right back to the grind. Even his iced coffee doesn't make him any less relentless ‚Äî you just can't escape him.

Honestly, these two scare me way more than any ghost or monster out there!

Who‚Äôs your personal monster this Halloween?

If you choose to be vegan for health reasons, be a vegan.  But I don't understand how people can be vegan solely because of climate change, but then they own a pet.  Owning a pet requires resources and doesn't benefit the environment.

It just seems like these people are projecting. selfish, conceded, and delusional.

For example they destroy paintings and statues in the name of climate change, but then look the other way when celebs like Taylor swift take 7 flights to pick up a coffee...

Making thousands of mistakes has led me to breathe slowly and practice awareness and still practicing maturity . 

Maturity is a fun game to play even more when you're bi polar. All the helpful aids and tips and support is the true superpower of our condition. Not the disease itself but all the things that help us along the way . 

So as I eat these 3 piece French toast sticks from burger king  and wait patiently for Thursday so I can earn 40 bucks I sit and enjoy the crispy goodness from these French toast sticks",2,1729702673.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

1gafheo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1gafheo/the_odd_fiasco_of_the_lawn_jockey_and_the/,The Odd Fiasco of the Lawn Jockey and the Butterfly's Wrist,"Lately, I‚Äôve spent all my spare time digging for information about the San Gabriel Racetrack.¬† It‚Äôs a century-old horse track out in the LA suburbs, where I grew up.¬† It‚Äôs not exactly the money-maker it was back during the good old days of horse racing.¬† But it‚Äôs our history.¬† So the county‚Äôs kept it safe from the dozens of development companies who‚Äôve been circling like vultures for decades, eager to get their talons on the valuable land the San Gabriel Racetrack sits on top of. ¬†

For now.

But that protectiveness for the racetrack has waned in recent years.¬† Everyone I ask thinks horse racing is mildly morally gross at best, grotesquely abusive at worst.¬† And I believe it wouldn‚Äôt take much to convince the powers-that-be to give up and close the track for good.¬† One disaster would do it.¬† A cheating scandal, or collapsed bleachers, or a drunken brawl, or really any incident that harms fans or horses.¬† The racetrack would be inundated with hostile press coverage, public goodwill would fester, and in the end, the track would be sold to the highest bidder to be razed and turned into luxury condos. ¬†

Don‚Äôt take your family to the San Gabriel Racetrack.¬† It‚Äôs about to go up in flames.

\*\*\*\*\*

All bartenders like to talk.¬† Bartenders who work at the theme bars and small clubs of Hollywood Boulevard like to talk, specifically, about all the weird crap they‚Äôve seen.¬† And if you‚Äôve ever been to Hollywood Boulevard on a Saturday night, you‚Äôd know ‚Äúweird crap‚Äù there is a very deep hole.¬†

I used to be one of them.¬† I rimmed rocks glasses with black salt and drizzled grenadine to look like blood at Kruger & Meyers, a horror-themed nerd bar between Ivar and Cahuenga.¬† I told myself when I got hired, a week after college graduation, that bartending at the K&M was a placeholder job, a gap year, a monetary band-aid while I studied for the LSAT and/or applied to business school.¬† But I liked the job.¬† I liked the work and my co-workers, and I made great money.¬† My professional life became an endless stream of costume parties, classic monster movie screenings, and 80‚Äôs slasher trivia nights.¬† In other words - my wildest childhood fantasy made real.¬† Halloween, every day. ¬†

Next year, I‚Äôd promise my parents.¬† Next year was the year I‚Äôd pick a real profession.¬† Year N+1, to infinity. ¬†

Monday nights, O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs Pub threw Industry Nights, specifically for the city‚Äôs waiters and dancers and Uber drivers - those of us who hustled all weekend while the rest of the city partied.¬† I used to attend with my clique of Hollywood Boulevard bartenders, drink Jamo and Ginger, and talk about all the weird crap we‚Äôd seen that week.¬†

Dark nights mid-fall, we‚Äôd kick around local urban legends.¬† Like The Gatsby Clown.¬† Supposedly, a young blonde thing with a bob and flapper dress used to pace up and down Hollywood Boulevard in flawless, intricately-detailed clown makeup.¬† Sightings of her occurred between three and five in the morning, after the bars closed and all but the bravest urban wanderers had found their way home.¬† If you crossed paths with The Gatsby Clown, and you asked politely, she‚Äôd describe - in gross, grisly detail - your pending death.¬† She wouldn‚Äôt tell you¬†*when*¬†you‚Äôd die.¬† But, since those who spoke with her tended to vanish shortly afterward, I‚Äôd assume the answer to¬†*when*¬†was¬†*soon*.

There‚Äôs also the one about the Beast of Cahuenga: a six-foot-long, purple, eight-legged cryptid that looks like a cross between a Gila monster and a cockroach leviathan, sighted in dumpsters on quiet nights.¬† Or, if you like your bar stories good and bloody, the Vaca Verde Taco Truck.¬† It‚Äôs said to be a front operation for an organ harvesting ring that snatches lone drunks off side streets, chops them up for parts, and grinds the un-sellable organs into taco meat. ¬†

And then, there were the rumors about The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† Those were different.¬† Because The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist was real.

At first glance, The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist didn‚Äôt warrant a second.¬† It was a nondescript little dive bar a couple blocks west of mine, sandwiched between La Cantina Flora (famous for its bottomless frozen margaritas) and Checkers Piano Bar (famous for jazz bands and 25-buck espresso martinis).¬† The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist didn‚Äôt have a theme of its own.¬† Just a red lamp over the door, tinted windows, and a dirty grey awning, which displayed its name in faded white letters.¬† The place was never busy, never advertised - no posters, not even a menu board out front - and seemed to exist solely to catch spillover from the cooler, more interesting bars that surrounded it. ¬†

It remained open for nine months, total, from mid-2019 to early 2020. The bartenders at The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist, if they even existed, never socialized with the rest of us. ¬†

The place was just creepy.¬† So of course, again and again, we found ourselves talking about it.

‚ÄúCody said the bathroom there didn‚Äôt even have electricity,‚Äù Diego told the rest of us.¬† ‚ÄúHe flicked his lighter so he could see what he was doing, and pitch-black hands reached for him out of the mirror.‚Äù¬† Diego took a long sip of his Johnny and soda.¬† He and Cody were both bartenders at Petal, a little club on Vine that hosted burlesque performances.

‚ÄúI know Cody,‚Äù said Stephanie, who danced at The Pink Cat.¬† ‚ÄúHe microdoses.¬† I‚Äôm a hundred percent sure anything that comes out of his mouth is bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard there‚Äôs a basement,‚Äù Gillian cut in.¬† ‚ÄúMy manager told me they‚Äôve got a sex dungeon down there.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right,‚Äù said Diego.¬† ‚ÄúThey do the sickest crap you can‚Äôt find other places‚Ä¶ pup play, piss and shit stuff, girls who‚Äôll drug you and stick needles into your balls‚Ä¶‚Äù

Stephanie rolled her eyes.¬† ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

Paul, a cook at Checkers Piano Bar, frowned.¬† ‚ÄúI think they keep animals.¬† Dogs.¬† A couple times, I heard dogs barking and going crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt some dude die in that bar?‚Äù Floyd asked.¬† ‚ÄúIt was on the news.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it was outside, on the sidewalk.¬† Two drunk tourists got into a fight.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that was a different story,‚Äù Floyd insisted.¬† ‚ÄúSome local rando - an accountant, I think - died inside the bar.¬† He was shot.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard he was poisoned!‚Äù

‚ÄúI met a guy who used to work there,‚Äù said Matt. ¬†

We shut up and listened.¬† Matt managed the bar at Stella‚Äôs Library; he‚Äôd never mentioned knowing a bartender from The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist before.

‚ÄúIt was a couple months ago,‚Äù Matt explained.¬† ‚ÄúRight after The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist opened.¬† Young guy‚Ä¶ his name was Grant, we used to buy cigs from the same liquor store.¬† He told me they‚Äôd had a Bartender Wanted sign in the window.¬† So he walked in, and whadd‚Äôya know?¬† The owner was there.¬† Middle-aged guy with a European accent.¬† Grant said he lit up a cigarette right in front of him, but he also gave him the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there a basement?‚Äù Diego asked.¬† Stephanie shook her head.

Matt shrugged.¬† ‚ÄúIf there was, Grant never saw it.¬† He also never saw the owner again.¬† No manager, no security, he usually worked alone, and he told me he could‚Äôve got away with anything.¬† Underaged kids, drinking on the job, whatever.¬† No one there gave a shit what he did.‚Äù

Paul raised his glass.¬† ‚ÄúPerfect gig.‚Äù

‚ÄúI doubt it,‚Äù Matt said.¬† ‚ÄúGrant lasted three weeks.¬† The tips were crap - the only customers the place attracted were weird loners or drunk frat boys who‚Äôd gotten thrown out of the other bars.¬† But that wasn‚Äôt all.¬† Grant said the bar didn‚Äôt feel right.¬† Like, it had some real twisted juju.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*

Now, I‚Äôd never actually been inside The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† The dingy little bar became like wallpaper to me; I‚Äôd never been inspired to walk in and check out their tequila selection.¬† Plenty of better, more welcoming places around for that.

The day before Thanksgiving 2019, I found street parking on Cherokee.¬† Hours later, after work, I sat in the driver‚Äôs seat and texted my wife, Lucy.¬† We were set to fly to Pittsburgh that night.¬† My brother attended veterinary school in Pennsylvania; my mom had decided we needed to bring Thanksgiving to him. ¬†

Lucy texted back.¬† She was tied up at the office and wouldn‚Äôt be home for another hour.¬† I stared up from my phone - and right through the tinted windows of The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† A homeless man, dirty and mumbling to himself, crossed the street in front of me. ¬†

I leaned back and closed my eyes.¬† I‚Äôd taken what I thought would be a dead-slow afternoon shift.¬† But, as it turned out, a lot of people had come into town for the holiday - and those out-of-towners all needed a drink before a long weekend with their families.¬† I opened my eyes and watched the front of The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† Our flight didn‚Äôt leave until one in the morning.¬† I had time to kill. ¬†

Back when I was a naive little lambling in college, I majored in journalism.¬† I‚Äôd buried that career path years before - and the vanishing opportunities, shit pay, and long hours chasing stories around the country with it.¬† But I‚Äôd kept the bordering-on-obsessive curiosity that had drawn me to journalism in the first place.¬†

With that last Industry Night conversation fresh on my mind, I decided to go for a drink at The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.

A mechanical bell tinkled as I stepped through the door. ¬†

The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist looked like a stock photo labeled Crappy Dive.¬† There were a few round, black cocktail tables and high chairs.¬† A pockmarked wooden bar top surrounded by red stools.¬† A standard display of liquor: mid-range, nothing too flashy.¬† One customer sitting at the bar, one bartender behind it.¬† An average bar, just like a million other bars in Los Angeles.

Well, maybe not.¬† I looked at the sole customer, blinked, and looked again.¬† Yep.¬† It really was him: the homeless guy I‚Äôd just seen wandering across the street outside.¬† Now, he sat at the farthest stool from the door, sipping brown liquor, face obscured by stringy hair and a filthy, oversized camouflage jacket. ¬†

The bartender - a black girl who didn‚Äôt look old enough to drink - wore a pink t-shirt and fuzzy pajama bottoms with little red hearts.¬† When I‚Äôd walked in, she was pouring Bailey‚Äôs and butterscotch schnapps into a rocks glass.¬† I assumed the drink was for the homeless guy.¬† But the bartender replaced the bottles and took a sip herself. ¬†

I sat down on a stool.¬† The bartender eyed me as though I were an an overly-friendly squirrel.

‚ÄúUm, can I get a coke?‚Äù I asked.¬†

The girl nodded and, wordlessly, procured a can of coke.¬† My eyes were drawn to something on a shelf, between bottles of Frangelico and Goldschlager. ¬†

A small, bizarre porcelain figurine.¬† A woman all in white with a blue skirt, arms raised in a ballerina pose, head cocked.¬† She had no eyes or nose.¬† Just comically-oversized pink lips.¬† A third arm extended from her flank, and wings poked out of her back.¬† The wings were thin, fragile and lavender, the texture of stained glass.

I stared at the figurine.¬† The bartender noticed me staring.¬† She took another sip of her drink.

‚ÄúIt keeps me numb,‚Äù she said, indicating her glass.¬† ‚ÄúI feel it less when I‚Äôm a little buzzed.‚Äù

The homeless man, suddenly and violently, slammed his fists on the counter.¬† ‚ÄúStupid Obama!‚Äù¬† He screamed.¬† ‚ÄúObama took my pension!‚Äù

I stiffened and jerked towards the door.¬† The bartender didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúThe pigs took my car!‚Äù The man announced.¬† ‚ÄúThey drugged me, and I passed out, and bam!¬† Pigs all over it, stealing all my clothes, throwing my food on the ground.‚Äù

I took a swig of my coke.¬† The sickly-yellow hanging lights caught the ballerina figurine‚Äôs purple glass wing. ¬†

My grip tightened on my can. ¬†

*Screw Pennsylvania,*¬†I thought.¬†¬†*I‚Äôm about to give up a Black Friday shift and a weekend because my mom wants all her children together for Thanksgiving.¬† Who cares that I have rent to pay and, ya know, responsibilities at work?¬† It‚Äôs not like my job‚Äôs*¬†serious¬†*or anything.*

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre jealous, because of their limits!¬† I‚Äôm gonna‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna make a billion dollars, because my mind is limitless!‚Äù

I felt my heartbeat quicken, blood pounding in my temples.¬†¬†*I mean, sure, it would make more sense for Kyle to come home for Thanksgiving.¬† We all live in LA, he‚Äôs the only one out of town.¬† But he can‚Äôt, because he‚Äôs in veterinary school, so we‚Äôve all got to go to him.¬† Because he‚Äôs the special little star.¬† He‚Äôs the good one.¬† Mommy‚Äôs favorite.¬† And I‚Äôm the family screw-up*

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a brilliant idea‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt tell you yet, but it‚Äôs gonna make me rich.¬† Then I‚Äôm gonna get my car back, and my pension back!‚Äù

The bartender picked up the handle of Bailey‚Äôs and poured a couple more shots into her cup.

Thin aluminum crinkled in my grasp.¬†¬†*I‚Äôm not going!¬† I bet I could make a thousand bucks in tips over the weekend.¬† Screw my family.¬† Is my family gonna give me a thousand bucks?*¬†

I slammed my coke onto the bar.¬† Cold, fizzy droplets of soda flew into my face. ¬†

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù The homeless guy railed.¬†

The three-armed ballerina figurine pouted at me, taunting with her puckered lips.¬†

*I had to get out of there.*¬†¬†

I dropped a ten onto the bar top, left my destroyed soda can, and ran back to my car.¬† I threw myself into the driver‚Äôs seat.¬† I closed my eyes.¬† I breathed.¬† The virulent rage I‚Äôd felt seconds before, sitting by the bar at The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist, dissipated into nothing. ¬†

I had no idea where the intense hostility had come from.¬† I¬†*wanted*¬†to go to Pennsylvania.¬† I wanted to spend Thanksgiving with my family,¬†*especially*¬†Kyle.¬† I was proud of Kyle.¬†

My phone chirped.¬† Lucy.¬† Back at our apartment, packed, and ready to leave for the airport. ¬†

I drove away.¬† I never entered The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist again.

\*\*\*\*\*

Months after my one and only drink at The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist, Coronavirus washed up stateside.¬† The state shut down.¬† The bars shut down.¬† Lucy and I holed up in our Koreatown apartment: her, working from home; me, baking sourdough and bringing my lady coffee, like the good little sugar baby I‚Äôd become.¬† I collected unemployment.¬† We didn‚Äôt stay six feet apart.

In June, Lucy came down with nausea and flu-like symptoms, freaked out, and high-tailed it to the nearest drive-through Covid testing center.¬† She tested negative.¬† We both quarantined for two weeks anyway.¬† When that was done, I bought her the over-the-counter test we probably should‚Äôve considered in the first place.¬† That test came up positive.¬† Lucy was pregnant. ¬†

Those two pink lines accomplished what nearly a decade of my mother‚Äôs nagging never could: they ended my infinite gap year. ¬†

It was time.¬† I‚Äôd just turned thirty; my Halloween t-shirt wearing, Bruce Campbell quoting, manic horror dream boy behind the bar schtick was getting stale.¬† Impending fatherhood became the impetus I needed to leave the late nights, heavy lifting, and pukey drunk-wrangling behind.¬† I‚Äôd long since realized I had no desire to be a lawyer or a finance bro.¬† Instead, I applied to graduate programs in special education, and decided to attend San Luis Obispo.¬† Lucy still worked remotely; we were both ready for a change of scenery, so we sublet our apartment and moved north.¬† ¬†

I lost touch with my Hollywood Boulevard bartending buddies.¬† We still liked each other‚Äôs photos on Instagram but, with classes and Lucy‚Äôs pre-natal appointments, I barely had time to scroll.¬† I knew, after Covid, not all the bars re-opened.¬† One that closed forever: The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.

We couldn‚Äôt blame Covid for that one.

It was a local news item most people missed.¬† In late February of 2020, with a viral pandemic quickly closing in on the West Coast, it had been easy to scroll right past the LA Times article about the Hollywood dive bar that burned down.

I remember that morning - one of my last days of work, before we shuttered indefinitely.¬† Flakes of ash settled on my windshield; a grey haze snaked around cars and trees and buildings.¬† I had to pull a U-turn on Cherokee; two giant LAFD trucks barricaded the intersection, cop cars lined the block, and the sidewalk was cordoned off with yellow police tape. ¬†

I learned, later, the most suspicious of my bartender friends were right: The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist had a basement, accessible via trapdoor, out of which the petty criminal owners ran an illegal gambling parlor and dog-fighting ring.¬† (Side note: massively screw anyone who engages in dog fighting, no lube.)¬† That night, a game of blackjack ended with one player‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say, displeased by how things went down.¬† A fight commenced, and that fight became a brawl, and that brawl moved upstairs, and in the metastasizing chaos an electrical heater was knocked over, setting the wallpaper ablaze. ¬†

Four patrons died.¬† Eight were hospitalized.¬† At least five men were arrested.¬† And The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist was a total loss. ¬†

I looked online and found pictures of the wreckage: the charred and splintered bar top and exploded liquor bottles.¬† I saw - I definitely saw - small bits of white porcelain littered across the floor, and melted purple glass. ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Fall semester of 2021, my school reverted to in-person classes.¬† That was a blessing.¬† I enjoy sweat pants as much as the next guy, but as anyone who‚Äôs ever taken care of a newborn can attest, when you‚Äôve got no reason to leave the apartment, that bubble gets pretty tight. Shaving is the first casualty, then bathing, and from there it‚Äôs a downward spiral to vermin-infested oblivion. ¬†

My point is, I was grateful to slide on pants with a zipper, drive to an actual college campus, and have conversations about anything besides breast milk.¬† I liked my cohort.¬† Most of them were like me: late twenties or early thirties working schlubs, some with kids, looking for career stability after years spent being¬†*interesting*. ¬†

The most interesting out of all of my classmates was a girl named Greta.¬† She was about my age, and she worked as a ghost hunter.¬† Not a ghost hunter like those douchebags with a cable reality show; the way Greta described it, she was more of a ghost therapist.¬† She‚Äôd come in with her bag of crystals and sage and protection spells, make psychic contact with the spirit, and convince it to go into the bright white light.¬† I asked her how much ghost hunting paid.¬† She said she didn‚Äôt do it for the money, and I translated that as ghost hunting doesn‚Äôt pay jack. ¬†

Greta and I weren‚Äôt friends.¬† Our relationship was limited to smiles and small talk.¬† So I was surprised when, a couple days before Thanksgiving break, she offered to pay for half my gas to LA if she could tag along.¬† It sounded like a great deal to me.¬† I‚Äôd planned on driving to my parents‚Äô house with little Raven on Wednesday; Lucy had a huge project due for work and desperately needed a quiet night in our apartment alone.¬† If Greta didn‚Äôt mind sharing the backseat with a baby, I told her I‚Äôd take her as far as she wanted to go. ¬†

‚ÄúHollywood,‚Äù she said.¬† ‚ÄúI have a job there.‚Äù

We set off the day before Thanksgiving.¬† Greta came armed with strange luggage: a knapsack, a rolled-up sleeping bag, and an incredibly creepy figurine in the shape of an old-timey jockey.¬† The doll was bigger than Raven, and it looked older than Greta and me.¬† It was made of thick plastic: a little boy with a massively oversized head, a blue jacket and ball cap, pants that had once been white and boots that had once been black.¬† The color in its eyes had washed out, leaving empty white circles.¬† Featherlike mildew stains covered its blue jacket and discolored skin. ¬†

I raised my eyebrows at the jockey boy.¬† Greta didn‚Äôt offer an explanation, but she shoved the disturbing thing under the seat and covered hit with her hoodie. ¬†

The first two hours of the three-hour drive were quiet; Raven slept in her carseat, Greta and I stared out our respective windows and appreciated the scenery.¬† But eventually, I bored of the silence.¬† And I got curious.¬†

‚ÄúThis job in Hollywood,‚Äù I asked Greta, ‚Äúwhat is it?¬† Like, what sort of spirit are you exorcising?¬† Little Victorian girl?¬† Bruce Willis, who doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs dead?‚Äù

Greta smiled.¬† ‚ÄúThat reference is, like, twenty years old, dude.‚Äù¬† Her smile faded.¬† ‚ÄúActually, I don‚Äôt know what exactly I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, who hired you?‚Äù

She scrunched her face.¬† ‚ÄúA guy.¬† He said his name was Tim.¬† Our age, maybe, wearing a suit.¬† He just emailed me out of the blue and asked to meet at Starbucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did he say?‚Äù¬† I pressed.¬† ‚ÄúDid Tim the Suit inherit a haunted house?‚Äù

Greta looked uncomfortable, like she really didn‚Äôt want to be having this conversation.¬† ‚ÄúA haunted business, I think.¬† Tim said he was working on behalf of a client‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt really specify‚Ä¶ he gave me ten thousand dollars.‚Äù

That shut me up.

‚ÄúTen thousand dollars,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúand he promised me another ten grand once the job‚Äôs done.¬† I‚Äôve never made so much money in my life.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I warned, ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs what sex workers say right before they drive out to the boonies to meet the serial killer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that!‚Äù Greta snapped. ¬†

I didn‚Äôt respond.¬† I got the impression she was trying to convince herself more than me. ¬†

She sighed.¬† ‚ÄúOkay fine, it‚Äôs kind of unsettling.¬† I‚Äôm supposed to go to this abandoned building and spend the night.¬† Tim said I can do whatever I want‚Ä¶ smudging, crystal work, Wicca‚Ä¶ so long as I follow two rules.¬† One: every hour, I need to write a diary entry in a notebook.¬† And two: I have to bring an old-fashioned lawn jockey.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúHence, Boy Annabelle?‚Äù I indicated the creepy figurine under the seat.

She nodded.¬† ‚ÄúI found him in my grandmother‚Äôs garage.‚Äù

Greta‚Äôs ghost-hunting gig sounded like How To End Up on a True Crime Podcast 101.¬† But she was an adult, and she swore she was a professional, and well‚Ä¶ I had nothing to offer that could compete with twenty grand.¬† So I kept on driving.¬† I got off the 101 at Cahuenga.¬† I turned onto Hollywood Boulevard and stopped at the address Greta had given me.¬† Then, I realized what that address actually was. ¬†

The burned-out husk between La Cantina Flora and Checkers Piano Bar.¬† The abandoned wreck that had once been The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist. ¬†

Numbing cold trickled down my spine and my arms and legs.¬† My fingers tingled.¬† I felt a warning surge of adrenalin curdle in my veins.¬† I remembered that night, years before, I‚Äôd sat on a barstool, staring at that disturbing ballerina figurine with three arms and purple wings, Hulk-smashing a Coke can while seething in anger.¬† I turned to Greta, who was gathering her sleeping bag and lawn jockey.¬†

‚ÄúListen‚Ä¶‚Äù I started.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I used to work around here.¬† This place is‚Ä¶weird,‚Äù I finished weakly. ¬†

Greta smiled reassuringly.¬† ‚ÄúSerious.¬† I‚Äôve slept in a house where a father murdered his whole family.¬† I‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to say.¬† And I still didn‚Äôt know how to put into words what I‚Äôd felt that night, how The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist had invaded my thoughts, twisting and warping them into something grotesque.¬† So I told her to call me if she needed anything and wished her luck, then watched as she opened the padlocked door with a key and disappeared behind the tinted windows. ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Initially, Greta seemed fine.¬† I texted her Thanksgiving morning; she responded with ‚Äújob went fine, brother picked me up.‚Äù ¬†

Cool. ¬†

She returned to class with the rest of us the following Tuesday.¬† Her hand was bandaged but, besides that, she appeared no worse for wear.¬† I didn‚Äôt get the impression she was intentionally ignoring me, but she also made no effort to follow up on our conversation in the car, and I didn‚Äôt push it.¬† I hadn‚Äôt seen The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist in over two years; bartending on Hollywood Boulevard felt like a distant fever dream, and I‚Äôd realized I harbored no desire to relive that part of my life.¬†

Christmas came and passed.¬† Final semester began.¬† I twisted in a hurricane of research papers and projects and student-teaching, and then I was graduating.¬† We relocated back to Los Angeles.¬† Lucy got promoted; I found a job at an elementary school in Sylmar.¬† Raven said her first words and took her first steps.¬† We discussed a down payment on a house and another baby. ¬†

Then, two weeks ago, Greta called.¬† She needed to talk.

\*\*\*\*\*

I meet Greta at a Starbucks in Santa Clarita.¬† I had no idea what was so important she couldn‚Äôt just tell me over the phone, let alone required a hike halfway across the state from the North Bay, where she‚Äôd moved after graduation.¬† We made small talk for awhile: she liked her job at a middle school in Santa Rosa; I liked mine with LAUSD.¬† Finally, I set down my coffee cup, leaned back in my metal chair, and straight-up told her I doubted she‚Äôd come all that way to compare notes on IEPs. ¬†

She took a deep breath.¬† ‚ÄúYou remember that place in Hollywood, right?¬† The one you drove me to on Thanksgiving, a couple years ago?‚Äù

I nodded.¬† The hairs on the back of my neck quivered, but didn‚Äôt stand on end.¬†

‚ÄúDo you remember that lawn jockey I brought?¬† And‚Ä¶ the guy in the suit?¬† Tim?¬† The rules?¬† I think‚Ä¶ what do you know about that place?¬† The bar?¬† Because something went into the statue, and they took it out, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not making sense,‚Äù I cut in.¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I remember that creepy little lawn jockey.¬† What about it?‚Äù

She sighed.¬† She tapped at her phone, then handed it to me. ¬†

I stared at a news article about the San Gabriel Racetrack.¬† They‚Äôd done some remodeling and improved the grounds.¬† The photo showed a little paved road leading to a new VIP betting parlor, lined with mismatched lawn jockeys.¬† The closest jockey boy figurine to the camera had a mildew-stained blue jacket, an oversized head with fading white eyes, a hairline crack across its cheek, and a jagged hole where its nose should have been. ¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it!‚Äù Greta exclaimed.¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the lawn jockey I took to that burned-out bar in Hollywood!‚Äù

An uncomfortable warm unease crisscrossed my chest.¬† But objectively, it was a ridiculous thing for Greta to say.

‚ÄúDude, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a million plastic jockeys like that,‚Äù I told her, shaking my head.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs the same one!¬† I‚Äôm sure about it.¬† The nose‚Ä¶ the crack‚Ä¶‚Äù She fell silent, cocked her head.¬† ‚ÄúI never told you what happened to me in that place, did I?‚Äù

She hadn‚Äôt.

\*\*\*\*\*

She said they‚Äôd swept the ashes and broken glass out of The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist; cleared the broken furniture.¬† Other than that, though, the place had barely been touched since the night of the fire.¬† It was empty, save charred walls and the splintered, blackened bar top. ¬†

Greta had spent the night in dirtier places.¬† She unrolled her sleeping bag, placed the jockey figurine on the bar top, and drew her personal protection circle with black salt and lavender oil.¬† She smudged with sage.¬† She put crystal displays at the four corners of both the bar and the empty, moldy basement below it.¬† Every hour, as she‚Äôd promised Tim the Suit, she wrote a diary entry in her spiral notebook.¬† She meditated, read her Tarot cards, and smudged again before curling up and falling asleep.

The little girl woke her in the early morning.¬† She was about ten years old, with short, curly brown hair and a knit, collared button-down dress.¬† Greta immediately recognized the girl as a spirit, because the cooked white rice she‚Äôd placed at her Buddhist altar shriveled up and turned black.¬† But Greta wasn‚Äôt afraid.¬† She smiled kindly at the ghost-girl and asked her name.

Justyna.¬† Justyna Mazur, who died in 1943. ¬†

Her father operated a small grocery store in that very spot - the place that would one day become The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† Their little two-person family lived in an apartment above the shop.¬† Her father saved his money.¬† He didn‚Äôt trust banks, so he kept it in a bag.¬† He saved and saved; he intended to use his accumulated fortune to bring his brothers and their families to California from Nazi-occupied Poland. ¬†

But a group of greedy men heard about Justyna‚Äôs father and the bag of money he supposedly kept hidden somewhere in his business.¬† One night, they forced their way into the store and upstairs to the apartment.¬† They grabbed Justyna from her bed and put a gun to her head; if her father didn‚Äôt hand over the loot, they threatened to kill her.¬† The gun went off accidentally.¬† Justyna crumpled to the ground.¬† Her father, overcome with grief, lunged at the men and wrestled the gun away from them.¬† He declared they‚Äôd never find the treasure they sought.¬† Then, he fired a bullet into his own temple. ¬†

Greta should‚Äôve kept talking to the girl, she admitted.¬† She should‚Äôve led her towards that bright white light.¬† Guided her into eternity. ¬†

But she didn‚Äôt.¬† Because all she could think about was that big bag of money.¬† She intended to find it for herself. ¬†

In the backyard, she found a shovel and a sharp brick.¬† She tore apart the walls, pulling off charred wood and digging through the foamy insulation.¬† She pried up the floorboards.¬† She beat holes into the walls of the basement and jammed the shovel into the ground until it shattered.¬†

*It‚Äôs all my father‚Äôs fault*, she thought.¬† He‚Äôd died of cancer when Greta was nine and left the family with nothing.¬†¬†*My mother is a worthless idiot*.¬† Her mother had wasted what little money they did have on alcohol, cigarettes, and falling for a pyramid scheme.¬†¬†*I‚Äôll show my brother.¬† When I find that money, I won‚Äôt share with him.*¬†

She tore and smashed and destroyed.¬† Her muscles ached and her fingers bled.¬† But she didn‚Äôt care.

*My friends are all broke, stupid idiots.¬† I‚Äôm paying too much money for that lousy school.¬† I know my landlord is going to make up lies to keep my deposit.¬† The money will be mine, and I‚Äôm going to laugh at them all.*¬†¬†

Tim the Suit arrived at eight o‚Äôclock the next morning.¬† He found Greta in the basement, sifting through shards of shattered concrete flooring. ¬†

Greta regained enough control over herself to feel embarrassed.¬† Hours earlier, in a fit of rage, she‚Äôd tossed the lawn jockey at a wall, cracking its cheek and breaking off its nose.¬† She‚Äôd kept to the rules - she‚Äôd written in the spiral notebook once per hour - but her later entries were chickenscratch grievances against her family, friends and classmates, then an unhinged list of all the things she‚Äôd buy once she found that money. ¬†

Tim, however, appeared quite pleased.¬† He thanked Greta, handed her a fat envelope, and asked if she needed him to call her a cab home. ¬†

Greta sat on the curb across the street and waited for her brother to pick her up.¬† Bits of char and insulation stuck to her hair, she was sweaty and filthy and smelled like must and fire, and her fingers were shredded and oozing and covered in splinters.¬† But what bothered her the most was the dark, obsessive hole she‚Äôd fallen into.¬† She couldn‚Äôt understand.¬† Outside the burned-out bar, in the bright morning sun, those overwhelming feelings of greed and anger and vengeance seemed alien.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like that,‚Äù she insisted.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make decisions for money‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a teacher, for Godsakes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what you mean,‚Äù I said.

I remembered the night I‚Äôd sat in The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist, sipping a coke.¬† I‚Äôd felt what she felt - the fury over losing out on a couple nights‚Äô tips, the rush of ultra-competitiveness, the resentment towards my mom and my brother Kyle.¬† I recalled the stories I‚Äôd heard; all the deaths, rumored and confirmed. ¬†

‚ÄúI did some research,‚Äù Greta continued.¬† ‚ÄúThere was never a grocery store there.¬† And I couldn‚Äôt find a record of any child named Justyna Mazur dying by gunshot.¬† But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the point.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt think so, either.¬† I knew exactly what Greta was trying to say.¬† I¬†*believed*¬†what Greta was saying.¬† I just couldn‚Äôt put it into words myself. ¬†

‚ÄúA spirit lived there,‚Äù she said.¬† ‚ÄúI think the spirit‚Ä¶ inspires greed and anger and the need to win.¬† I think I was sent there as a canary.¬† Or a guinea pig.¬† I was supposed to rile up the spirit and prove to‚Ä¶ whoever it was who hired me‚Ä¶ that the spirit worked as advertised.¬† And I think I trapped the spirit in the lawn jockey.‚Äù

I recalled another detail about The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† The figurine above the bar: a porcelain dancing girl with three arms, purple wings, and pouting lips.¬† Smashed to bits the night of the fire.

‚ÄúYou made the spirit portable,‚Äù I said to Greta.¬† ‚ÄúWhoever paid you, they bought themselves a‚Ä¶ a haunting to-go.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*

Greed, obsession, and hyper-competitiveness.¬† Desirable traits for customers when you‚Äôre running an illegal casino.¬† Or trying to destroy a race track.

I did some research into the 2020 fire at The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist.¬† Four men died that night.¬† One was found in the basement, lying in a pit of his own vomit, eyes bulging and lips blue.¬† He‚Äôd been poisoned with cyanide.¬† The second had been stabbed through both eyes with glass from two separate beer bottles.¬† The third succumbed to a traumatic brain injury on the floor of the bar.¬† A fourth man beat him to death with his fists.¬† He kept on punching after his victim stopped moving, when his knuckles embedded into brain matter, as the bar filled with black smoke.¬† He‚Äôd punched until he keeled over and died. ¬†

The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist was only open for nine months, yet at least six other deaths could be tied to it.¬† Two tourists from Arizona, who‚Äôd mortally injured each other and bled out on the sidewalk.¬† A bartender shot an accountant in the face after the customer accused him of watering down the vodka. Three TV crewbies, out for a quick beer after work, were admitted to the hospital with hair loss, vomiting, and chest pain a week later.¬† Within six months, all were dead.¬† Thallium poisoning.¬† It was suspected - but never proved - they‚Äôd been dosed by jealous co-workers at The Butterfly‚Äôs Wrist bar. ¬†

I obsessively Google‚Äôd the San Gabriel Racetrack.¬† An important race is scheduled November 29th.¬† I also searched for conglomerates that have expressed interest in buying the property.¬† The largest, and most dogged, is called The Angel City Group: the big doll in a nesting-doll series of shell corporations.¬† If I were a betting man, I‚Äôd bet money Tim the Suit works for them.

Greta and I agreed there wasn‚Äôt much we could do.¬† What were our options?¬† Call the police?¬† Report a greed ghost masquerading as a little girl, trapped in a moldy old lawn jockey on the San Gabriel Racetrack grounds?

Well, I need another option.¬† Desperately.

Because my brother Kyle, the veterinary resident, called last week.¬† He‚Äôs been offered the coolest opportunity ever: a chance to look after the horses at the San Gabriel Racetrack. Better yet, he got our whole family tickets to watch the race.¬† Lucy‚Äôs excited.¬† And Raven can‚Äôt wait to see the ponies.",2,1729702576.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm from out of state and haven‚Äôt been to MCI since the airport was completed, and will be flying in later this week. (I love KC and can‚Äôt wait to see the much needed upgrade!) 

I‚Äôll be landing in the morning with one checked bag (can‚Äôt get around that unfortunately), and I need to find a place to work for a few hours before heading downtown (ideally with a table and outlet if I‚Äôm being greedy). 

Is there an area like this available outside the security checkpoint so I can pick up my bag then work? Or is there a coffee shop close by anybody would recommend I go to instead? 

Not staying in a hotel so I can‚Äôt show up to my destination early‚Ä¶If going downtown to a coffee shop with a suitcase would make more sense I can, but I feel a bit odd posting up at a Starbucks with luggage.

1gafcre,https://i.redd.it/0zfrlqnvcjwd1.jpeg,Momo is my new favorite shop!! Reviews on my first 4 slimes from them.,"So thank you for everyone in this community for all the recommendations on Momo slime. I‚Äôve used peachybbies, kawaiislimecompany and slime fantasies (all wonderful too) however Momo slime is my absolute favorite!
I recently ordered 4 slimes and here are my reviews on them:

Haunted Pumpkin Forest:
LOVE this one so much (bingsu jelly with clay pumpkin add ins) that I ordered another similar bingsu clay from KY, this has the best bubble pops and not sticky at all.
10/10

House Blend Coffee Grounds:
Holy moly! This scent is beyond amazing, hints of mocha with coffee and the texture is so sizzly! Definitely understand why it was rated so highly.
9/10

Coquette Heart Cake:
This one was super fun to add the clay hearts in. Strawberry cake smell is amazing. Great texture and not too sticky (added a little activator and it was perfect)
8/10

Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew:
Had to get something pumpkin scented and this didn‚Äôt disappoint. Mixing the 2 together was the most amazing swirly color and so fun. A little sticky but again 2 sprays of activator and it was perfect. Bubble pops with this one too.

Then her ex showed up during the 3 days I couldn‚Äôt talk to her. By ""good,"" I mean she was telling me she missed me. Even though she was hesitant about getting into relationships at first, she was starting to believe in me. Then her ex came back, and she realized she still had feelings for him, so she backed off. Since then, she occasionally sends me TikTok or Instagram reels with hints in them.

I asked her about her feelings toward her ex, and she said she was never getting back with him. So, I‚Äôve kept the conversation light and supportive, telling her things like, ‚Äújust take your time.‚Äù (I don‚Äôt want to give up on her. I know what you guys will say, but fuck it‚Äîno matter the outcome, I‚Äôll accept it. For now, I‚Äôm still trying.)

The main thing I want to ask you guys about is this: I live in a different city from where my uni is, and because of the heavy rain, the metro didn‚Äôt show up. There‚Äôs this girl who‚Äôs kinda into me‚Äîbasically, she‚Äôs crushing on me‚Äîand she suggested we stay in a coffee shop and wait there. But it‚Äôs not really a normal hangout with a friend; she‚Äôs kinda treating it like a date. I was talking to her and mentioned the situation in a funny way to make light of it and also to subtly show her that I have options too. (I wanted to do this because I know myself‚ÄîI‚Äôm too kind, too caring, and too loving to the people I like, and I feel like the first girl is already taking that for granted.) She replied, more or less, saying, ‚ÄúSounds like a lot of fun,‚Äù and then said, ‚ÄúEnjoy.‚Äù After that, poof, she went offline.

This happened about an hour ago, so she might actually be busy. I don‚Äôt know. We‚Äôre both in uni, and it‚Äôs long distance too.

Most people commuted to other cities, and for those who didn't assuming one of the hundreds of resumes you put out called you in, you'd be there with 3 - 10 other interviewees. I got hired on the spot at a well known Canadian coffee brand because their turn over was so high they couldn't keep up.

Turns out this was because they treated their employees like shit and never fixed equipment from the AC to the deli fridge and the deli fridge was the thing that would land me in pain for the rest of my life. It was dented and under a table that shot out and it was a small location so to open it you had to bend over, squat kind of, twist sideways, lean under, and pull with all of your  weight and prey the busted door would open without you falling over.

I never fell over, but my kneecap came off and according to the other workers at the time my leg veered outwards which as far as I am aware, it not how legs are supposed to work. I was in agony immediately. I have a high pain tolerance but this set me in tears. I had to beg for the day off only to be reluctantly sent home which because of the mentioned lacking of infrastructure meant a hour long buss only to have to walk for a hour home from there.

I wasn't allowed to take another day off. We were told due to a ""influx of injuries"" that while they couldn't fire us legally, they weren't going to tolerate it and any full time employees would be moved down to one four hour shift a month until we decided to quit. I know this was more than just a threat, because they did this to my friend who slipped on the job and dislocated her hip. 

I asked for one simple thing, don't put me on the window. Our location is elevated so for even tall people you have to jump, lean your body on the sill, and bend over and out to hand stuff out. Out of malice they put me on the window basically every day since. This was a location where we bounced around stations as needed not where you have an assigned one (aside from baking) so it's not like that was my only place. They wouldn't let me have a chair and take orders on window, no I had to be giving orders out. 

To add insult to injury one of the other girls from the other shift had a identical incident, but her daddy was a lawyer so she got 6 months paid off. To make it even worse, there was a inspector who came in on my shift and tried to blame me for it because the manager was on vacation and I was ""promoted"" (they never gave me the pay, they just made me do the work while saying they would).

It's bee over 7 years and it never stops. I cant sleep in most positions, I cant sit in specific positions, I need to be very careful in how I bend, and if anything touches the knee cap it causes pain that lasts for weeks. I don't even know who I'd be able to talk to about this as I don't have a personal doctor and unless there's some secret surgery or something I doubt they'd be able to even do anything. It always hurts and I hate that I let them do that to me. It's too late to do anything about it legally, even if it wasn't it'd be difficult living below the poverty line.

my dad started bringing his long-time friend around the house about a month ago, someone i have no recollection of because i was too young to remember him when he was first introduced to my family. most of what i know about him is stories ive been told about how he went to jail (which is why he hasnt been around until now). this was fine at first, though he did make me kind of uncomfortable for no explainable reason.

he got a new dog not long after he first came back and started bringing it around the house, which i didnt really like, especially because we already have 2 dogs in the house and they werent properly introduced to this new dog at all. it's not house trained either, so it pees and shits on the carpet.

my dad's friend started staying over and then leaving the new dog in the house whenever he went to work, which i wasnt happy with at all because now i have to watch a dog that isn't mine and clean up after it, and i'm not even getting paid for it. i brought up my problems with the situation to my mom first, who would relay it to my dad (we've never really been close enough to talk about my problems) and then i would hear about his reactions from my mom. i eventually got the opportunity to talk to my dad about it after he neglected to actually approach me or make it feel like he was approachable on the situation, and i thoroughly and clearly explained i did not want to take care of the dog whatsoever.

he sort of laughed it off, said he wasnt going to make our home a second home for his friend, and then started making excuses for his friend, which is where the conversation ended. the dog was left in the house again and my dad said it would be just that one time, that i would be paid, but then the dog was left there a second time and he was pissed that i brought up the money. after talking to my mom about it, apparently he meant ""just this once"" as a blanket statement? so of course this led to my dad and i arguing over text about how he didnt think it was a big deal, that he was paying me so he thought i would be fine with it. i told him that this wasn't the case at all and that i didnt like how he was just assuming things without actually asking me, that it made me feel like he wasnt taking me seriously. he said he would find other arrangements and that was essentially the end of it.

for about 5 days, i didnt see the dog or his friend at all, which made me happy. but then he started sticking around and leaving the dog here again, which my dad claims to have had no idea that his friend was doing that, but i wasnt paid for it either. it's now been here for close to 6 days, excluding 12 hours (7am-7pm) on tuesday, which goes totally against everything my dad said to me and makes me feel justified in the fact that he wasnt taking me seriously. im also not being paid for it anymore.

throughout all this, my dad wasnt even talking to my mom about when his friend would be coming around, his friend just showed up without warning and was expected to be accomodated. we live on the poverty line and theres only 3 people living in the house, so my mom usually only buys groceries for 3 people, but now she has to go out of her way to buy extra to feed him. he drinks all of her coffee in the morning and leaves the tv on when he leaves the house to go to work. today, he left the back door wide open when he left and didnt put away my mom's coffee creamer. he gets the dogs all riled up at 6-7am, which wakes me up every time without fail and has gotten to the point where i purposefully set an alarm for 7am even despite knowing ill only get 4-5 hours of sleep (i often cant fall asleep before 12am, just not tired enough). there was even a point where he was putting the trash and recycling in the wrong bins and didnt think to ask about which one was which.

my dad excuses all of this behavior by saying it's his friend, that hes a good dude, that this guy sometimes brings food to the house or that he can get fake grass for our backyard and whatever, so obviously it all outweighs the bad because hes ""just being himself."" another point is that my dad doesnt want his friend's dog to be left in a cage all day at home, which is why he lets the dog stay here; it is something i *understand*, but still dont agree with because my dad said he would find other arrangements, which hasnt happened. he says he wants to do what's ""easiest for everyone"" without even considering what ive said to him.

so, basically, i don't even know what to do anymore. nothing i say is getting through to him and even my mom has expressed how upset she is by all this, but my dad gets offended because apparently nobody can say anything bad about his friend. ive told him numerous times i need him to communicate with me, and my mom has done the same, but he never says anything and just expects us to be cool with it.

tl:dr; my dad cant communicate about the simplest of things and gets mad at me and my mom for being upset about it.

what do i even do? is there anything i can do, or am i just fucked until i can move out? i feel like nothing i say will convince him anymore.",0,1729701640.0,Advice,6,0.5,False

In recent weeks I've been working on getting back into the midlength game.

I even joined a polyamorous relationship.  The only thing I'm missing is a new midlength board.

I'm considering the Pleasant Pheasant from Almond, the CI Mid, and the Lovelace ThickLizzy.  

Pleasant Pheasant looks nice / good shape but I've never tried an Almond before and I don't know anyone who has.

CI Mid looks great too, but all of the used ones are beat to shit which makes me think the glass on these is cheap / brittle (never had a CI before either).

The Lovelace ThickLizzy is similar enough to my old Trimcraft Haley Pin which was a great board, but I kinda want to try something different.

I was on Lexapro for years, switched to celexa a few months ago. Currently on 20 mg celexa and no other medications. 

The exhaustion is real. Last night I got a solid 8 hours of sleep. Woke up to make my bf breakfast before he left for work. When he left, I went back to bed and proceeded to sleep for another 3 hours.

Thankfully I‚Äôm self employed and didn‚Äôt have anything pressing today but I should not be sleeping for 11 hours!

What advice or guidance do y‚Äôall have? Does Wellbutrin help with this? My doctor mentioned trying it out with me when I was on Lexapro. 

Things I‚Äôve tried: 
‚Ä¢ staying awake after I get up to make breakfast - doing this I‚Äôve found I‚Äôll be exhausted and drained the entire day
‚Ä¢ alarms - I sleep through them or subconsciously shut them off. I sleep with an Apple Watch and still can‚Äôt wake up
‚Ä¢ coffee or caffeine to stay awake

I dropped by the coffee shop earlier in the hot day after work to grab a coffee, she was in and served me and i told her the coffee taste good since she made it and she smiled.

That same night, i got a message saying she doesn't want a relationship with me and only sees me as her customer and i didn't reply at all to that message got blocked after that. I consider that as i got being rejected then.

CW: Age Gap, Grooming(?), Infidelity




**New York Times**

*May 5th 1976*

**Affair between President and Staffer?**

*by Thomas Waterten*

As the 1976 Election draws near, President Kennedy faces allegations that could sink his campaign. A former Staffer, an Allison J. May, age 24, accused the President of having a two year affair with her behind the back of his wife Ethel. 

May began work at the White in the Summer of 1973 during the Church Administration as a staffer for then Vice President Kennedy out of a desire in her words ‚Äúhelp make the country a better place‚Äù. May first applied for the position during her Senior year at Akron University. May was quickly picked up and given a position in the Vice President‚Äôs staff. Even in the early days there were signs of desire from the Vice President to the young lady. ‚ÄúHe always went of his way to greet me the first thing in the morning. At the time, I thought he was just attempting to be friendly. Looking back, I realized he was being a flirt‚Äù.

According to May these greetings would turn into coffee meetings where she got to know the Vice President more. By the fall she would become a full time member of his staff. Her first sexual contact with then Vice President Kennedy allegedly began sometime in October where according to her:

‚ÄúIt started off with talks of reports about the budget I think. It was about the spending on healthcare and how to deal with the rising cost. But at a certain point it stopped being about that. I got closer and closer to me until he was staring directly into my eyes. He told me: ‚ÄúMiss May, has anyone ever told you what gorgeous eyes you have?‚Äù. It startled me. At first I thought I had misheard him. I said, ‚ÄúMr. Kennedy, I am not sure if I heard you correctly? Are you attracted to me?‚Äù. He then kissed me. Looking back, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs worse. The fact he took advantage of me, or that at that moment in time, I liked it. I really liked it. I enjoyed being wanted and desired. I was called Mundane May back in High School but to be desired like this by someone like Bobby, I was willing to go along at first. To be clear, Bobby didn‚Äôt hurt me, at least physically or mentally. I didn‚Äôt do anything I didn‚Äôt want to do. I was a dumb girl who got swept off her feet‚Äù. 

According to May, between the Fall of 1973 and the Fall of 1976 she and the then Vice President would have various sexual engagements. According to May, it was known by President Church by the time of the Winter of 1974 but that Church choose to not address it, believing it was a conversation best left between Kennedy and his wife Ethel. According to May, the President‚Äôs Wife was also aware of these encounters but that she chose to stay with him and that Bobby did truly love her and remained a committed father to their 11 children. Furthermore May would allege that Bobby had flings with other women including the late wife of his brother Senator John F. Kennedy. 

However, after the assassination of Church on the 9th of October there was a major shift in the mindset of the President. May claims that he would talk to her less and less after October. At first Miss May assumed he was just focusing on getting things in order. That was until December when she would get a pink slip and a termination of her employment. 

President Kennedy has denied the rumors, calling them ‚Äúlies, absolute lies‚Äù. For starters, Kennedy has argued that she was terminated not as an employee of himself but the office of the Vice President, and thus after his selection of Carter as Vice President in December, it would be his domain regarding Miss May and her employment. While the President has confirmed that he and Miss May were ‚Äúcolleagues, acquaintances, friends whatever you wanna call us‚Äù and has confirmed that ‚ÄúMiss May was a close confidant with whom I could speak to as an equal and fellow man about the stresses of my office‚Äù he gone as far as to call the accusations ‚Äúslanderous‚Äù, stating to the press yesterday: 

‚ÄúI have not, not ever had an affair with any woman. I am a happily married man of twenty six years and with her I had eleven beautiful children. I would rather die than hurt my wife or our family. I believe, and a major emphasis on believe, that Miss May is simply bitter about the fact that her employment didn‚Äôt open the door immediately to a greater political career and in her anger decided to take it out on me, my family, and this administration. It is why she is now working so closely with Republicans in this investigation into me. Now let me be cleat, I will comply with the investigation to the fullest of my ability. My wife Ethel has stated she has my back every step of the way, my good friend Jimmy Carter says he will be by my side, and my party promises to stand with me. I hope through this investigation that my name will be cleared and my reputation maintained‚Äù.

The Republican Party has capitalized on the allegations, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms has promised that he would ‚Äúhelp fund any legal action Miss May wishes to take regarding the inappropriate behavior of Mr. Kennedy toward this young girl. I will fund it to the penny. You hold me to that‚Äù. According to internal records, Senator William Buckley Jr. of New York called him a ‚Äúcradle snatcher‚Äù as rumor about the alleged affair spreads. Governor of Texas John L. Hill Jr has demanded that Kennedy resign to ‚Äúrestore nobility and dignity to the Oval Office and the position of President‚Äù.  

All the while Ethel has promised to stay with Kennedy regardless of what the results of the investigation would be, saying:

‚ÄúI love my Bobby. I don‚Äôt think he would do such a thing, but I know he loves me and I love him. He has always been a loving husband and a wonderful father. Even if it comes to worst, I know in my heart that I will still love and can find it in myself to forgive him‚Äù.",5,1729700228.0,Presidentialpoll,15,0.78,False

I've been using the same relatively cheap set-up since day 1. I'm upgrading my grinder and was wondering, what upgrades you guys did (not only grinders) that you later regretted because it was too hard, too expensive, time consuming, low quality etc.

Cheers

The crowds sucked. I was pretty close to the front both times but there was basically no moving at all at WWWY (someone even told me off for bumping their coffee)  and for most of Blink at Reading the majority of the crowd was more interested in watching through their phones rather than dancing, moshing, singing or whatever.

I get it some people go to experience watching their favourite musicians play a show but a huge part of the pop punk for me is about releasing some angst, dancing, moshing basically letting the music take over a bit. I'm not saying the front row or whatever needs to be phone free although I would prefer it, but an area where people that want the 00's Warped Tour experience to enjoy themselves would be sweet.

1gaegfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonfresh/comments/1gaegfy/price_increases_on_tons_of_items/,Price Increases on tons of items,"I saw the post with the discounts bc the warehouse was closing but has anyone seen big price jumps? We used to order more before they jacked the minimum up, then didn't until they dropped it to $100 and how order every couple of months, as Fresh has some stuff not readily available in most stores and the prices tend to be ok. 

Suddenly half the cart (have stuff on repeat items and put some stuff in and wait to see if there are sales) has jumped by like $2 an item?

There's a spreadable ""butter"" we get that's been $3 or $3.49 for a long time. It's currently $5.49. Which might be due to some pre-holiday jump in butter prices but it's $2 for one thing and it's a TON of stuff.

A frozen Morningstar thing that was $5.49 is now $6.99; Amazon basics frozen veg has been from $.99-$1.19 a bag, they're now $1.99. A Coffee creamer we get regularly that was $5.49 is now $7.49; American cheese that was $7.49 is showing $10.49. Literally wtf. 

As above, we have the cart usually sitting there waiting until we order and noticed the jump a few days ago. It's not like well haven't ordered for months so didn't notice increases adding up. We last ordered 3 weeks or so ago, and the prices have been pretty static within $.50 for a good while and suddenly huge jumps. Is anyone else seeing this? What's the deal?
