1oa5yph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1oa5yph/damage_may_exceed_policy_limits/,Damage may exceed policy limits,"I got into an at fault car accident in the beginning of January 2025, it caused my air bag to go off and I hit some sort of utility vehicle and it looked like very minimal damage on the vehicle itself. The driver on the other hand had a metal coffee cup in his hand and when I hit him it resulted in a small cut under his eye from the coffee cup but over all he seemed fine. I hurt my thumb but wasn‚Äôt broken I didn‚Äôt get taken in an ambulance and neither did he. 5 months after the accident he filed a claim for medical expenses and now I‚Äôm receiving letters saying that my policy may not cover all the damages. I fully own my vehicle so I did not have full coverage insurance, my insurance company did not pay for any damages on my car or anything regarding myself. I‚Äôm very anxious about what can happen it seems they are looking for additional payments but I‚Äôm not sure for what.

(An anime-style, Victorian maid story)","*‚Äú19th of October, 1885‚Äù The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family‚Äôs issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs not going to be that bad?‚Äù She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. ‚ÄúBut when will I get to see them again? In months?‚Äù A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*‚ÇäÀö ‚úß ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚ä±‚ãÜ‚ä∞‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ‚úß ‚ÇäÀö*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they‚Äôd live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I‚Äôll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (Ôºæ-Ôºæ)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I‚Äôd appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I‚Äôd love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we‚Äôd write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don‚Äôt want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

**About me:**

*‚ÇäÀö ‚úß ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚ä±‚ãÜ‚ä∞‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ‚úß ‚ÇäÀö*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you‚Äôre dealing with. You may call me Frog. I‚Äôm a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don‚Äôt be deterred by that even if you‚Äôre from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don‚Äôt have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that‚Äôs worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you‚Äôll understand <3

**About you:**

‚ÇäÀö ‚úß ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚ä±‚ãÜ‚ä∞‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ‚úß ‚ÇäÀö

Here you‚Äôll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I‚Äôve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don‚Äôt want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let‚Äôs brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

1oa5uen,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oa5uen/i_was_entered_into_the_secret_second_phase_of_a/,I was entered into the secret second phase of a study and it is ruining my life - petals and promises part two,"If I would have known that this second phase existed, I would never have taken part in the survey. 


I guess that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt tell you about it. 


I was right, I won‚Äôt keep you waiting.


I was looking at the survey that I had taken, complete with the answers that I had given. 


The final question, the fourth question had been highlighted in that terrible yellow and the text had been set to bold.


I looked back to the roses, my brain was so scattered I felt like I just zigzagged around my kitchen all night, but I knew I needed to find the note that the delivery girl mentioned. 


An easy find. I made my way back over to the roses and held them to inspect, but a small rolled up note untucked itself and fell to the table.


Hands shaking, I took a breather before I looked at the note, it was just two lines long. I steadied my hands.


*‚ÄúOne out of three‚Äù*, in neat handwritten ink pen was the first line, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.‚Äù was the second.


*One out of three, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.*


My head pulsing, the jigsaw coming into clear view as opened my laptop and typed the website address in. Again, immediate redirection to the google document where I went straight to entering the password.


*1993*, I was in. 


My vision wobbled, locking in on the yellow part of the survey. The fourth and final question. 


It read: *‚Äúif an intruder were to enter your home without your consent and threaten your life, if necessary, would you use deadly force to prevent them ending your life?‚Äù*


I had answered **yes**, which had set in stone just below the question, definitely one of the most regrettable tickbox decisions I have ever made. 


The lady at the coffee shop, the man-on-the-highway, Ryan and Katie. They were questions one through three. 


The self defense one was the only question left. 


Question four. 


Killing a murderous intruder is the last‚Äòhypothetical‚Äô situation posed from by survey. The only one that had not yet been realised in some way. But if we had completed three of the ‚Äòquestions‚Äô, why did I only get ‚Äòone out of three‚Äô?


It hit me.


*Flash.*


I had been tested .


I had lived up to my word on only *one* of the questions. 


I had said that I *would* help someone on the side of the road.


I had said that I *wouldn‚Äôt* help anyone cover up a bad deed..


 I had said that I *would* try and reunite a person with their lost valuables.


Only one of those has been demonstrably true. 


Three times, my word had been tested. Twice, it failed.


The google document. *Focus*. 


I studied the questions again to see if there were any clues hidden in this version, anything that could help me make this all just *stop.*


The wording on every question read exactly the same as the first time I‚Äôd seen it on Reddit. Word for word. 


I studied the page I noticed one very big difference between this document and the one I saw the first time around. Page two. 


The first document only had one page which was identical to page one of this new document. 


I‚Äôm certain that the document only had one page the first time, I remember it vividly ‚Äî it struck me as someone who has written these kinds of research questionnaires before that this one was *so* short, *so* brief. 


It opened with a short paragraph at the top thanking the participant and asking for full honesty in exchange for their anonymity.


Underneath the introduction, the four questions were listed just as I have phrased them here with a small space under each that held two tick boxes ‚Äî one for **yes,** one for **no**. 


It finished with a fleeting expression of thanks for the honesty and the time taken to complete. That was it. 


It‚Äôs not uncommon for research surveys to be upwards of eight or nine pages, with one or two often dedicated just to explaining the aims of the research and explaining any rules. 


This one page-er was such an anomaly that I actually went to look for any missing pages and skim the post I‚Äôd found it on where multiple comments mentioned ‚Äúwishing all surveys were this short!‚Äù ‚Äî I was reassured.


I didn‚Äôt think about it. 


I just thought I‚Äôd complete the survey and be glad that I could pat myself on the back for taking thirty seconds to help someone with their project. 


I hovered my mouse over the second page and I took a deep breath, as I exhaled, I clicked. I closed my eyes. 


Another inhale, *1, 2, 3.*


Eyes open. 


*Flash.*


*‚ÄùThank you for your participation in part one of our survey.*

*‚ÄùA small number of participants may be subjected to the second phase of the study which includes an exercise in which the participant is asked to* *re-assess and if necessary revise their answers after a series of practical exercises.‚Äù*


Practical exercises? 


*Practical exercises.* 


The jigsaw, complete. 


I knew that all of the pieces were right in front of me; lined up all nice on the table in the form of flowers and a business card, glittered by the white glow of my laptop. Everything was right here, in perfect order.


But, the jigsaw was somewhere in my far-off peripheral vision and I just could not see it clearly. No matter how much I tried to see, it remained distorted. 


Until it didn‚Äôt. 


It all snapped into view.


*Flash.*


My far off, distorted perception now central and clear. 


The research wasn‚Äôt focused on the answers that I had given on the survey. 


They didn‚Äôt care which way I swayed when it came to big moral decisions, I could have answered either way and it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. 

What matters to these people, is whether I am being honest. 


If my *actions* match my *answers.*


They want to know if my dishonesty is a product of an attempt to deceive *them*, or if I am deceiving *myself*.


I had been chosen for the second phase and I had failed two of the three tests that had been posed to me so far. 


My brain was grating, had these researchers been responsible for my flat tyre? Had they made sure I‚Äôd be late for work‚Äî heightening the stakes for when I found the highway man?


Had someone been on a mission to appeal to my brother‚Äôs wandering eye? 


When I finally looked at the group chat, the boys had met up after work at a local bar to push happy hour to its limit. I was supposed to go, but it hadn‚Äôt even entered my head. 


After work, all I could think about was the business card in my jacket pocket.


A few of the boys sent ‚Äòwish you were here‚Äô type photos at the happy hour, followed by some ‚Äòyou‚Äôre missing out, dude‚Äô type photos at a strip clip an hour and a half later ‚Äî
two starring Ryan.


I checked the times, my brother called to warn me about Katie‚Äôs call 25 minutes after the ‚Äòlook at us, we‚Äôre at a strip club‚Äô selfies. One could say he is quickly persuaded.


Had someone that I know had something to do with this? Someone must know an awful lot about me to have facilitated all of these tests.


Yet, I never even gave my name. 


I shifted my focus to the more immediate problem that illuminated my table through my laptop screen. I could figure *‚Äòwho‚Äô* ,*‚Äôwhy‚Äô* and *‚Äôhow‚Äô* out later, right now I needed *‚Äòwhat‚Äô* and *‚Äòwhen‚Äô*, ideally.


The second survey. The laptop.
There specifically, the part of the survey that had been highlighted in obnoxious yellow. 


The fourth question and my answer to it. 


The fourth question presumably still awaited its exercise and the clue from the question ‚Äî given what I know about the first three, tells me that if there was a practical exercise, it was a threat. 


To my life. In my home.


I know that they know where I live, the flower delivery girl knew my address and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs not the only one, they obviously know far more than I do. 


There‚Äôs just one test left.

1oa5u06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1oa5u06/i_had_sex_with_the_manager_after_he_cried_to_me/,I had s*ex with the manager after he cried to me about his difficult life with wife at home,"I 30F am Slovenian and worked (As support) for a big company with big production plant in Austria. And this guy 46M , was the leader, the top manager there. Big coincidence but he was also Sl0venian. And he was upset and angry with us for taking his people jobs.

So he was the top guy, around 400 people under him. He had a reputation for being intelligent but harsh, intimidating, and impossible to please. But took decisions under pressure in a very short time and I wanted his respect and validation. He never even heard of me.

We had only one interaction - over a year ago. There was a scheduling issue, and I had to call him. I thought that sharing the same langauge and all that will make it better and more personal...

He didn‚Äôt know who I was and immediately started shouting, saying our work was a disaster and that I didn‚Äôt understand anything. We took their jobs and we are now ruining the company. It almost made me cry. he said he doesn't care its not my fault, he wants it fixed. That its not an option I talk to my manager as I suggested, but I have to, its mandatory. He asked me if I can do simple things and do something together here and now, with him. Something really simple and open a file. I asked him to be polite to me. He said he is and I said: you are raising your voice at me. he said yes, because he is angry.

I reported him after that call. It was handled by headquarters, and we never spoke again but he had to explain his behaviour towards me

A year later, I moved to Austria with the same company, so where he is the leader. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to ever run into him again. But a few weeks ago, I saw him at a bar. I said hello, he didn't know who I am. I said hello because I was looking at him and I felt it was awkward. I told him who I am and he said: ah you that woman who reprted me.

He offered me a drink and then another, but we stayed sober mostly. We talked a lot more than I expected. He told me things I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever hear from someone like him. He cried and said he‚Äôs married but unhappy. That he married his wife because it seemed like the practical thing to do at the time but he doesn't get along well with her. said the woman he truly loved got married to someone else. He has two kids, one with autism, and he feels stuck, angry, and tired all the time.

That night, something happened between us that shouldn‚Äôt have( i don't know what I am allowed to say, but you get what I mean). He was very r... ough with me. His wife was at her parents.

The next morning, at the office, everything was different. He avoided me completely. He cancelled a meeting where he was supposed to be present, even though it was part of his responsibilities. He didn‚Äôt look at me once when we bumped into each other at the plant coffee shop

I don‚Äôt know what to think. I can‚Äôt tell if it meant anything to him or if he just needed an escape for a night. I‚Äôm not proud of what happened.",0,1760817918.0,AITH,0,0.5,False

I guess that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt tell you about it. 


I was right, I won‚Äôt keep you waiting.


I was looking at the survey that I had taken, complete with the answers that I had given. 


The final question, the fourth question had been highlighted in that terrible yellow and the text had been set to bold.


I looked back to the roses, my brain was so scattered I felt like I just zigzagged around my kitchen all night, but I knew I needed to find the note that the delivery girl mentioned. 


An easy find. I made my way back over to the roses and held them to inspect, but a small rolled up note untucked itself and fell to the table.


Hands shaking, I took a breather before I looked at the note, it was just two lines long. I steadied my hands.


*‚ÄúOne out of three‚Äù*, in neat handwritten ink pen was the first line, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.‚Äù was the second.


*One out of three, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.*


My head pulsing, the jigsaw coming into clear view as opened my laptop and typed the website address in. Again, immediate redirection to the google document where I went straight to entering the password.


*1993*, I was in. 


My vision wobbled, locking in on the yellow part of the survey. The fourth and final question. 


It read: *‚Äúif an intruder were to enter your home without your consent and threaten your life, if necessary, would you use deadly force to prevent them ending your life?‚Äù*


I had answered **yes**, which had set in stone just below the question, definitely one of the most regrettable tickbox decisions I have ever made. 


The lady at the coffee shop, the man-on-the-highway, Ryan and Katie. They were questions one through three. 


The self defense one was the only question left. 


Question four. 


Killing a murderous intruder is the last‚Äòhypothetical‚Äô situation posed from by survey. The only one that had not yet been realised in some way. But if we had completed three of the ‚Äòquestions‚Äô, why did I only get ‚Äòone out of three‚Äô?


It hit me.


*Flash.*


I had been tested .


I had lived up to my word on only *one* of the questions. 


I had said that I *would* help someone on the side of the road.


I had said that I *wouldn‚Äôt* help anyone cover up a bad deed..


 I had said that I *would* try and reunite a person with their lost valuables.


Only one of those has been demonstrably true. 


Three times, my word had been tested. Twice, it failed.


The google document. *Focus*. 


I studied the questions again to see if there were any clues hidden in this version, anything that could help me make this all just *stop.*


The wording on every question read exactly the same as the first time I‚Äôd seen it on Reddit. Word for word. 


I studied the page I noticed one very big difference between this document and the one I saw the first time around. Page two. 


The first document only had one page which was identical to page one of this new document. 


I‚Äôm certain that the document only had one page the first time, I remember it vividly ‚Äî it struck me as someone who has written these kinds of research questionnaires before that this one was *so* short, *so* brief. 


It opened with a short paragraph at the top thanking the participant and asking for full honesty in exchange for their anonymity.


Underneath the introduction, the four questions were listed just as I have phrased them here with a small space under each that held two tick boxes ‚Äî one for **yes,** one for **no**. 


It finished with a fleeting expression of thanks for the honesty and the time taken to complete. That was it. 


It‚Äôs not uncommon for research surveys to be upwards of eight or nine pages, with one or two often dedicated just to explaining the aims of the research and explaining any rules. 


This one page-er was such an anomaly that I actually went to look for any missing pages and skim the post I‚Äôd found it on where multiple comments mentioned ‚Äúwishing all surveys were this short!‚Äù ‚Äî I was reassured.


I didn‚Äôt think about it. 


I just thought I‚Äôd complete the survey and be glad that I could pat myself on the back for taking thirty seconds to help someone with their project. 


I hovered my mouse over the second page and I took a deep breath, as I exhaled, I clicked. I closed my eyes.

He has a ‚Äúwitching hour‚Äù from 8 pm to 1am where he is normally very fussy, eats for a moment then cries, arches his back in pain, kicks his legs, spits up frequently, and comfort sucks on his hands even though he refuses to eat. He‚Äôs gaining weight just fine, but has these daily episodes where he‚Äôs clearly uncomfortable or in pain. 

Other times of the day, he usually eats just fine and sleeps peacefully. 

The biggest thing I‚Äôve noticed is what I believe is mucus in his poop. His stools are green and liquidy/slimy. I didn‚Äôt know what the pediatrician meant when she asked if there was mucus in his poop but now I‚Äôve examined it a bit more, I believe that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing. If I squish the diaper together and pull apart, the poop is stringy and sticks together like goop. 

Everything I‚Äôve seen though has said these allergies usually develop after a couple months, not just two weeks. We put him on gas drops about 4 days ago to help the spit up (under the assumption is was reflux) and while his spitting up has improved a bit, his other symptoms haven‚Äôt.

1oa5kyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oa5kyd/does_my_partner_have_control_issues_with_money_or/,Does my partner have control issues with money or am I being dramatic?,"Here‚Äôs some context before I begin. My husband grew up with his family stressed about money constantly. Because of this, he has definitely developed a scarcity issue around money. He actually makes pretty good money, but he‚Äôs full commission so the ups and downs can stress him out sometimes. That being said, we make really good money for our age. I am 27 and he is 28 and to be honest we‚Äôre probably in the top 10% of people our age when it comes to net worth. We own a home, we live in a nice neighborhood, and we have two children.

I want to add in another piece of context that my husband and I both grew up Mormon. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with Mormon culture, it‚Äôs pretty intense. Women are expected to stay home and when we got married that was what I wanted to do. We have since left the church but these traditional roles are still pretty ingrained in us. I was not taught how to make my own decisions, but to follow the men in my life. I‚Äôm now in therapy to work through these things. 

Okay now that we have the caveats down, I‚Äôll begin. We have been married for about seven years and money has been a constant disagreement in our marriage. I have consistently had to ask to spend money from our joint bank account(even when I was working full time). I do have access to our joint account but when I spend from it I‚Äôm heavily questioned or he gets mad and we fight over the purchases. I stay at home with our two kids now, and because of these disagreements,I started to teach Piano on the side and opened up my own bank account so I could have a little money to do what I want with. He was actually very supportive of me opening up my own bank account and working, so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being dramatic about our issues. 

I make about $1000 a month and I pay for my kids clothes, toys, gifts, anything for their nursery or room, and other expenses. This also covers anything I need, clothes, deodorant, face wash, decorations or little things for the home, birthday presents, a lot of the holiday costs etc‚Ä¶ I thought $1000 seemed like more than enough but the costs add really quickly. My kids grow fast, they‚Äôre always needing new clothes, and their rooms aren‚Äôt even fully finished. He also frequently asks me to pay when we eat out or asks me to buy coffee and meals for the family. I also attend therapy twice a month and I pay for one of those sessions. I budget this money somewhat decently but especially around the holidays, it gets pretty tight. I rarely get my hair or nails done, I don‚Äôt get a lot of the beauty services that many of my friends do. I frequently say no to these services when my friends ask if I want to go with them because I want to conserve my money. I don‚Äôt even go grocery shopping without him, he says it‚Äôs because he likes to go and spend time with me, but I have a heavy suspicion it‚Äôs because he wouldn‚Äôt trust me with the money. I offer to go by myself all the time and he says he‚Äôd rather come with, maybe I‚Äôm a b*tch and this is a really sweet thing that he does but I don‚Äôt know. 

Anytime we go on a vacation or do something that costs money as a family, it‚Äôs typically a very big fight. I can‚Äôt think of a single trip we‚Äôve done that hasn‚Äôt caused a big fight. We have friends who want to travel with us and go to concerts with us and I feel awkward always saying no when they know that we make decent money. I just have to avoid it because it would just cause too much of a fight with my husband. The only times I go to concerts or events with my friends is if I save up my own money, which I‚Äôm okay with it would just be nice to have a little more access to our joint money. I feel like I miss out on life experiences that are important to me because he acts like we can‚Äôt afford anything. 

He also wanted me to pay for my daughter‚Äôs school and dance each month which would cost over $300. I told him that would be too much and after a huge fight he ended up agreeing to pay it. If we were not financially well off, this would not bother me. I actually think this would be a very reasonable set up if we weren‚Äôt having big paychecks. The problem is that we are used to getting big paychecks and I don‚Äôt get to touch it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being ungrateful because the large necessities of my life are being taken care of which I understand is a huge blessing.  

It causes huge fights and endless budget meetings if I bring up wanting to buy patio furniture or things for the kids rooms. If it doesn‚Äôt cause a fight, it‚Äôs because I decide to just let it go. He always tells me that once he‚Äôs making more money, we‚Äôll buy things for the house but when the money rolls in, he puts it in the savings account or invests it into crypto. He says he wants to create generational wealth but won‚Äôt use it to improve the quality of our lives right now or buy his kids clothes or shoes. Again, they don‚Äôt go without because I purchase them but before I had my own bank account we would argue everytime my daughter needed new clothes. I still can‚Äôt help but feel frustrated that I work and budget my money so closely when we actually have a large stash of it that I don‚Äôt get to touch. We also have a large crypto portfolio, and I‚Äôd love if he just took some of it out because I‚Äôm not totally comfortable with how much money is in crypto but he‚Äôs made it very clear that it‚Äôs not an option. He is very intense about his investments and will not budge. 

My life is taken care of, and I understand that I‚Äôm very lucky to have a home and a car that I get to drive, health insurance, and food on the table. And I know he gets really stressed over finances so I don‚Äôt want to make him feel like he‚Äôs not doing enough but I‚Äôm tired of this. I feel trapped even though I‚Äôm comfortable. I hate feeling like I don‚Äôt have access to money, it‚Äôs a huge trigger for me. I could take more piano students but I‚Äôm stretched thin as it is and finding child care would be hard. I can‚Äôt help but feel trapped even though I know I‚Äôm very lucky. It‚Äôs a strange way to feel. I know it‚Äôs such a first world problem because my needs are being taken care of, and in this economy, I know I shouldn‚Äôt take that for granted.

I also want to say that he knows this is a problem for me and has made efforts to improve. We have a tax return coming soon and he did say I could use it for myself, the kids, home improvements and Christmas, which is great! He is in a bit of a slump at work right now so I understand his stress at the moment but even when the money is flowing really well, these issues still persist. I want to work through it and I really do love him. Maybe I‚Äôm just naive and don‚Äôt understand enough about money? Maybe this is completely normal (though I don‚Äôt think it is based on how other couples in our lives handle money). I‚Äôm just feeling lost and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I guess that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt tell you about it. 


I was right, I won‚Äôt keep you waiting.


I was looking at the survey that I had taken, complete with the answers that I had given. 


The final question, the fourth question had been highlighted in that terrible yellow and the text had been set to bold.


I looked back to the roses, my brain was so scattered I felt like I just zigzagged around my kitchen all night, but I knew I needed to find the note that the delivery girl mentioned. 


An easy find. I made my way back over to the roses and held them to inspect, but a small rolled up note untucked itself and fell to the table.


Hands shaking, I took a breather before I looked at the note, it was just two lines long. I steadied my hands.


*‚ÄúOne out of three‚Äù*, in neat handwritten ink pen was the first line, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.‚Äù was the second.


*One out of three, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.*


My head pulsing, the jigsaw coming into clear view as opened my laptop and typed the website address in. Again, immediate redirection to the google document where I went straight to entering the password.


*1993*, I was in. 


My vision wobbled, locking in on the yellow part of the survey. The fourth and final question. 


It read: *‚Äúif an intruder were to enter your home without your consent and threaten your life, if necessary, would you use deadly force to prevent them ending your life?‚Äù*


I had answered **yes**, which had set in stone just below the question, definitely one of the most regrettable tickbox decisions I have ever made. 


The lady at the coffee shop, the man-on-the-highway, Ryan and Katie. They were questions one through three. 


The self defense one was the only question left. 


Question four. 


Killing a murderous intruder is the last‚Äòhypothetical‚Äô situation posed from by survey. The only one that had not yet been realised in some way. But if we had completed three of the ‚Äòquestions‚Äô, why did I only get ‚Äòone out of three‚Äô?


It hit me.


*Flash.*


I had been tested .


I had lived up to my word on only *one* of the questions. 


I had said that I *would* help someone on the side of the road.


I had said that I *wouldn‚Äôt* help anyone cover up a bad deed..


 I had said that I *would* try and reunite a person with their lost valuables.


Only one of those has been demonstrably true. 


Three times, my word had been tested. Twice, it failed.


The google document. *Focus*. 


I studied the questions again to see if there were any clues hidden in this version, anything that could help me make this all just *stop.*


The wording on every question read exactly the same as the first time I‚Äôd seen it on Reddit. Word for word. 


I studied the page I noticed one very big difference between this document and the one I saw the first time around. Page two. 


The first document only had one page which was identical to page one of this new document. 


I‚Äôm certain that the document only had one page the first time, I remember it vividly ‚Äî it struck me as someone who has written these kinds of research questionnaires before that this one was *so* short, *so* brief. 


It opened with a short paragraph at the top thanking the participant and asking for full honesty in exchange for their anonymity.


Underneath the introduction, the four questions were listed just as I have phrased them here with a small space under each that held two tick boxes ‚Äî one for **yes,** one for **no**. 


It finished with a fleeting expression of thanks for the honesty and the time taken to complete. That was it. 


It‚Äôs not uncommon for research surveys to be upwards of eight or nine pages, with one or two often dedicated just to explaining the aims of the research and explaining any rules. 


This one page-er was such an anomaly that I actually went to look for any missing pages and skim the post I‚Äôd found it on where multiple comments mentioned ‚Äúwishing all surveys were this short!‚Äù ‚Äî I was reassured.


I didn‚Äôt think about it. 


I just thought I‚Äôd complete the survey and be glad that I could pat myself on the back for taking thirty seconds to help someone with their project. 


I hovered my mouse over the second page and I took a deep breath, as I exhaled, I clicked. I closed my eyes. 


Another inhale, *1, 2, 3.*


Eyes open. 


*Flash.*


*‚ÄùThank you for your participation in part one of our survey.* 


*The purpose of this survey is to provide some data to support or challenge some of the ideas and conclusions we come to around a number of topics including;*
*Participant‚Äôs perception of self and how that may influence own grasp on the reality of the self,* 
*Honesty and how the participant chooses where and when it is appropriate to be dishonest.*
*Participant‚Äôs motivation to appear righteous over authentic, even when offered anonymity and absence of consequence.*
*Other topics may also be explored given the psychological applications that this research has potential toward.*


*‚ÄùA small number of participants may be subjected to the second phase of the study which includes an exercise in which the participant is asked to* *re-assess and if necessary revise their answers after a series of practical exercises.‚Äù*


Practical exercises? 


*Practical exercises.* 


The jigsaw, complete. 


I knew that all of the pieces were right in front of me; lined up all nice on the table in the form of flowers and a business card, glittered by the white glow of my laptop. Everything was right here, in perfect order.


But, the jigsaw was somewhere in my far-off peripheral vision and I just could not see it clearly. No matter how much I tried to see, it remained distorted. 


Until it didn‚Äôt. 


It all snapped into view.


*Flash.*


My far off, distorted perception now central and clear. 


The research wasn‚Äôt focused on the answers that I had given on the survey. 


They didn‚Äôt care which way I swayed when it came to big moral decisions, I could have answered either way and it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. 

What matters to these people, is whether I am being honest. 


If my *actions* match my *answers.*


They want to know if my dishonesty is a product of an attempt to deceive *them*, or if I am deceiving *myself*.


I had been chosen for the second phase and I had failed two of the three tests that had been posed to me so far. 


My brain was grating, had these researchers been responsible for my flat tyre? Had they made sure I‚Äôd be late for work‚Äî heightening the stakes for when I found the highway man?


Had someone been on a mission to appeal to my brother‚Äôs wandering eye? 


When I finally looked at the group chat, the boys had met up after work at a local bar to push happy hour to its limit. I was supposed to go, but it hadn‚Äôt even entered my head. 


After work, all I could think about was the business card in my jacket pocket.


A few of the boys sent ‚Äòwish you were here‚Äô type photos at the happy hour, followed by some ‚Äòyou‚Äôre missing out, dude‚Äô type photos at a strip clip an hour and a half later ‚Äî
two starring Ryan.


I checked the times, my brother called to warn me about Katie‚Äôs call 25 minutes after the ‚Äòlook at us, we‚Äôre at a strip club‚Äô selfies. One could say he is quickly persuaded.


Had someone that I know had something to do with this? Someone must know an awful lot about me to have facilitated all of these tests.


Yet, I never even gave my name. 


I shifted my focus to the more immediate problem that illuminated my table through my laptop screen. I could figure *‚Äòwho‚Äô* ,*‚Äôwhy‚Äô* and *‚Äôhow‚Äô* out later, right now I needed *‚Äòwhat‚Äô* and *‚Äòwhen‚Äô*, ideally.


The second survey. The laptop.
There specifically, the part of the survey that had been highlighted in obnoxious yellow. 


The fourth question and my answer to it. 


The fourth question presumably still awaited its exercise and the clue from the question ‚Äî given what I know about the first three, tells me that if there was a practical exercise, it was a threat. 


To my life. In my home.


I know that they know where I live, the flower delivery girl knew my address and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs not the only one, they obviously know far more than I do. 


There‚Äôs just one test left.

My location was Toronto Canada.

I ended up declining the offer since it was pretty low, the company itself is not super prestigious and I had a FAANG offer in hand already.

1st round - Recruiter screen

* This will be pretty general. Questions about what projects you've worked on, questions about your resume, your reason for wanting to join Veeva, etc.
* Make sure to know your resume well, how to answer common behavioural questions
* Most importantly, you have to let the recruiter know you want to join Veeva because of its core values, culture, and how interested you are in their company mission and how much purpose and meaning it gives you.
* Research the company if you haven't already. This page will be enough: [https://careers.veeva.com/why-veeva/](https://careers.veeva.com/why-veeva/)

2nd round - Online Assessment OR Hiring Manager + Live Coding round

* Two options here, either they will give you a coding assessment or a 1.5 hour long round with a hiring manager + a small coding question at the end
* Coding Assessment (this will be either frontend or backend focused)
   * Frontend -> Expect questions about HTML, CSS, JS and React. These will be multiple choice, some questions will involve debugging, and others will involve creating small components
   * Backend -> Expect LeetCode easy / mediums, maybe general questions on Java + OOP
* Hiring Manager + Live Coding
   * 1 hour discussion on your resume and projects you've worked on, more about why you are interested in Veeva, etc
   * 30 minutes live coding
      * Frontend -> Expect to create a small React component
      * Backend -> Expect 1 LeetCode Medium

3rd round - Technical Phone Screen (NOT ALWAYS GIVEN)

* This round is sometimes skipped if you've done well, and instead you go directly onto onsites
* This is a 60 minute live coding round with a hiring manager. No behavioural questions asked here.
   * Frontend -> Expect to create a small React component + general frontend questions (how does React work? What is the virtual DOM? Redux vs UseContext, etc)
   * Backend -> Can be either OOP type question or LeetCode medium, and additional questions about Java (how does hashmap work internally, etc)
* Might be general questions related to Software Engineering too (version control, SDLC, etc)

Onsite Round #1 - Live Coding (either frontend focused or backend focused)

* This round is 60 minutes, focused purely on technical abilities
* Frontend -> Expect React questions, Frontend System Design questions, frontend performance optimization stuff, and a live coding portion where you create a React component
* Backend -> Expect LeetCode medium, Java Trivia, possibly an OOP question

Onsite Round #2 - Job History

* Extreme deep dive into your resume and past projects
* 60-90 minutes long
* You explain projects you're proud of, projects with the greatest technical difficulties, etc
* General STAR based behavioural answers can benefit you here
* Very rarely, some people get asked a coding question at the end (either frontend or backend focused, similar to the previous rounds)

Onsite Round #3 - Why Veeva

* Questions about what you know about the company
* 45-60 minutes
* Why you want to join Veeva
* Make sure to research the company well

Onsite Round #4 - Coffee Chat

* Interview with 2 or 3 junior / mid-level engineers on the team
* 30-45 minutes
* Very casual, you ask them questions you're curious about and they ask you general behavioural based questions

So that's the general flow of the entire interview process. I declined their offer as I was using them mainly for practice and went with a FAANG instead.

The most important things you MUST do:

* Research the company. Go to the page I linked above and make sure to read it all.
* Have a good reason for joining Veeva. They value people who want to stay in the company long-term (5+ years) and who want to genuinely help people through their work.
* For frontend roles, make sure to know React very well. The live coding will all be in React, with the occasional question about JavaScript
* For backend roles, make sure to know LeetCode mediums, OOP concepts, and really know a lot about Java. Knowing Spring Boot can help a bit too but focus more on the other topics.",1,1760816893.0,csMajors,0,1.0,False

We live in a fairly hot climate. When I moved back, in spite of the temperatures, I would have my remote therapy sessions on the patio for more privacy because I felt more comfortable doing so where there was a lesser chance of being overheard. My sessions are 50 minutes from 8-9 am every 2-3 weeks.

I also asked my mother if she could wait until I wasn't in the room to read out disturbing/graphic news stories (e.g., extreme cases of violence against women).

A couple weeks ago, she brought up that she's ""fed up"" that I'm ""preventing her from using her own space when she wants to"" because she's started drinking coffee outside in the morning now that the weather has cooled off, and my therapy interferes with that. I'm also apparently ""silencing her in her own home"" regarding the news; she says she should be allowed to talk about it with her husband because ""we should be aware of what's happening"" and because ""it's real.""

I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm now doing my therapy sessions in my car. I know I'm not entitled to the space here, but I also don't think I'm asking anything so extreme that it negatively impacts her life moreso than it makes my time here more comfortable. AITA?

1oa5amy,https://i.redd.it/qioxl0fxbxvf1.jpeg,Two Week Post OP,"I know this is very late, but here is my two week follow up, and also leading into the picture where I stopped writing at Day 17. 

Day 8: I spent most of the day in pain, as my head was really bothering me. I ended up taking my narco, and alternating between Tylenol and Motrin. I mainly spent most of the day sleeping, and relaxing in bed. My pain this day was a 9. I ended up taking a shower with assistance to help with the neck pain. 

Day 9: My pain was not that bad on this day. I mainly took Tylenol and Motrin this day. I also decided I should try to walk without my walker, and went out to go grocery shopping. I ended up spending the rest of the day relaxing. Overall my pain was a 6. 

Day 10: Bad mistake on trying to walk. I was in intense pain, and ended up taking a narco :( The only bright side on this day, is that I had family come over. This is the first time I had anyone visit me after my surgery. All I been getting is phone calls, so it was very nice seeing family, after being very lonely. The only one that has been with me the whole time is my boyfriend. They even made us dinner, which definitely gave me enough energy for this day to make up for the day before. Pain this day was at a 9, and I also rotated between Tylenol and Motrin.

Day 11: My neck and vision was really bad this day. I been getting these black specks float around, and my neck felt like it was pulling all day. The glue, and the tape over my incision started to get really itchy, and my neck was also swollen. I also had constipation this day, but this time I was prepared. I was really starting to worry that my incision was infected. I also had a very bad headache this day, but it was not the normal Chiari headache. It was basically a migraine, which was a first in a while for me, however it went away very quickly now that over the counter pain medicine works for me now! I ended up taking a muscle relaxer, and alternating between pain meds. I also drank a bunch of coffee to help relieve any of the pain I was having. Pain this day was 9.

Day 12: I was very tired, and did not get hardly any sleep this day, and was very nervous for my upcoming appointment. I had all the questions in mind to ask, and the numbness I been getting on and off on my foot. Also the question about my optical headache, and the floating specks I been seeing. I was also very nervous on if my incision was healing good or not. I ended playing video games for the first time this day, and that‚Äôs definitely helped with calming my nerves down. Pain this day was not that bad, and I ended up just taking Tylenol and Motrin. I also ended up taking a shower, to help with some of the dizziness I was having along with the neck tension. I did end up going to the bathroom, which helped relieve some tension I was having, and calmed my stomach down as well. I ended up relaxing this day, and watching movies later in the night.

Day 13: I was very nervous heading up to the appointment. I was ready to get every question I had in mind, and ask away. The first thing I brought up was my vision. Now they did inform me that if my vision went blurry, seeing double, and intense headaches, I would need to get an emergency scan done to make sure there isn‚Äôt damage behind my eye. I was also informed from the PA that it might just be side effects, and my body getting used to my new skull/ brain. Another possibility was that it could just be a new headache, as many with Chiari get new or lessen headaches after surgery(which was what the PA said to me). I was also told my foot or numbness could be from my syrinx still healing, and or to follow up with neurologist. It could be something else wrong in my nerves, but once again I am still healing. I really hope that all of this goes away, but slowly it is(as of now). They also said my walking was still pretty bad, and they did not want to risk me going back to work, due to my job being very physical(lifting, and climbing ladders). I was told I could cause a leak, which is no bueno. Bright side though is my incision looked great, and was healing very well! I was told to stop taking my narcos, and if I needed more muscle relaxers I could ask. I was also informed to try not to use my walker, and to try to walk more(even though it has been very difficult). This was also the day they removed the tape, and as much glue as possible. I guess they accidentally double layered the glue, so it was still stuck in my hair. I was also given permission to take a normal shower, and soak my head completely to get the glue off. I was super happy about that! Overall, I think my follow up went very well. After my appointment, I spent some time watching movies, and relaxing. I also took a bath, and soaked my head to get as much glue off as possible. Pain was not too terrible, but my head was very irritated from the removal of the tape, and glue so it caused my neck to be inflamed. I ended up taking my muscle relaxer, and alternating between the over the counter medicine. Another thing that was mentioned, was my PA was very surprised I had leftover pain meds, and I really try to avoid taking strong medication, and try to save it for the worse days. You never know when it can get bad. I watched movies for the rest of the day, due to the weather being not that great outside. Pain this day was about 7 overall.

Day 14: I ended up getting pretty good sleep this day, and decided to try to not use my walker. I ended up walking around the house a bit without it. I also once again went to the store to get some groceries. I felt pretty okay this day, and I only took the over the counter medicine. The only thing that was really bothering me was the leftover glue in my hair, and the tension it was causing on my neck. I would say this day alone was about a 7. Didn‚Äôt really do much after the shopping, and spent the rest of the day playing video games.

Day 15: I should really learn my lesson on walking without my walker. I feel like this is going to be a daily problem for a while until my balance is steady, and once my neck is completely healed. I realized that if I walk too far, or over due it, I am in very bad pain the next following day. I ended up giving in and took a narco, and spent most of the day in bed this day. I could barely even walk, and was super dizzy, and nauseous. I also took Zofran to help with the nausea, and tried my best to just take it easy. My pain was back at a 10, and I also had a headache as well, which did not help at all. I ended up using my walker the rest of the day to get around in the house. 

Day 16: After spending the previous day in bed, the only pain I had was in my neck. However it was still inflamed due to the glue, and was swollen at the bottom of the incision. I started to think I had an infection, but thankfully after taking medicine(over the counter), and a muscle relaxer, it went down. I also took a shower to get more glue off my head. I spent some time walking around the house with the walker, and tried to get my balance to improve. My pain this day was about a 7.5, but definitely felt way better than the day before. 

Day 17(day of picture): My pain was not that bad, but I tried to walk without my walker again in the house. I had family come over, so I wanted to show them that I can walk! They said my balance look okay, and that I was looking better and better. I felt very proud of myself, and for the first time in a while, I did not get super dizzy. However, the next day ended up being in pain from walking. I learned I still have time to go, but I know eventually I will get there! I only used over the counter medicine this day(pain 6).

I know this is a very late post, as I am now on week 3, and won‚Äôt post again until my next appointment where I hope to get good news. I also have been having a hard time moving my neck to the left that I did not mention, due to me being able to after two full weeks later. I also have not been able to sleep without ice packs being around my head, that was also not mentioned. I thought I would add this here, as another item I have been using daily to help with pain. Thank you for reading, and will update everyone later!",1,1760816649.0,chiari,0,1.0,False
1oa5a1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oa5a1v/21f_and_got_asked_out_for_the_first_time_help/,"21F, and got asked out for the first time. help !!","
**history-**
so im 21F and i got asked out by my hallway crush (23M)!! i‚Äôve known him for a couple years, but we‚Äôre acquaintances at most. we compliment each others outfits sometimes, and small talk about our similar interests. i matched with him on bumble about a month ago and messaged him but he never replied. i thought that‚Äôd be the end of that but to my surprise, he asked me out in person the other night! 

**this is exactly how it went down:**
i was omw out from campus and he asked me how my class went. we finished our small talk and right as i was about to walk out the door, he called out to me. i turned back and approached him again and he said, ‚Äúwould you be down to get a drink sometime? coffee or smoothie or sumn?‚Äù 

that was the last thing i was expecting. i was short circuiting but im afraid my response came off too friendly:

21F: *hesitation as i try to process what‚Äôs happening* ‚Äú‚Ä¶yes! yea im down‚Äù

23M: ‚Äúidk when ur free or what ur schedule is like or if ur busy-‚Äú

21F: ‚Äúi dont think i have anything going on during reading week.‚Äù

23M: ‚Äúhaha okay! imma‚Ä¶. hit u up then‚Ä¶‚Äù

21F: ‚Äúokay! yea lmk! well, see ya!‚Äù *walks back out*

**after-**
üò≠üò≠ well first of all, he didn‚Äôt exactly specify it was a date, but i‚Äôve spoken to a couple friends who‚Äôve reassured me that he was definitely asking me out. my worst fear is that it was a misinterpretation and that he was really just asking casually as a friend to get to know me better. but with my friends‚Äô reassurance and the history of the fact we‚Äôve matched on bumble before kinda keeps me convinced that this is a date.

**the question-**
a dilemma though. it‚Äôs been 2 days since this happened. he hasn‚Äôt dm‚Äôd me or reached out in any way at all. should i be worried? my main concern is that he could think i‚Äôm not actually interested, so i‚Äôve been debating reaching out to him first despite the expectation he set up that he‚Äôd be ‚Äúhitting me up.‚Äù i‚Äôm getting so antsy waiting for a text from him, but im also scared that im misunderstanding something. is it normal for it to take this long to follow up? should i just stay patient and wait? or should i reach out to confirm my interest?

my friends have suggested that he could just be nervous, but i really don‚Äôt see him as a nervous person at all. he‚Äôs a super extroverted and laidback guy. the only explanation for nerves would be that he‚Äôs specifically nervous around *me*, but i have a hard time wrapping my head around that üò≠ well im 21F and have never been in an actual relationship, so that should be expected. am i just lacking self-confidence and he could really be nervous? or are my friends just making me delusional? 

**TL,DR:** it‚Äôs been 2 days since i got asked out by my hallway crush and i‚Äôm having a hard time deciding whether i should follow up, or wait for him to follow up because he was the one who said he would. friends suggested he could just be nervous but he‚Äôs a very extroverted and laidback guy. is it normal to have to wait this long? am i just being impatient? or should i be worried? i‚Äôm very excited about this if u couldnt tell ü•≤

i know this sub is technically for people already in relationships, and that there are dedicated ‚Äúdating advice‚Äù subs but i honestly didn‚Äôt want to post to those cuz i was afraid of the men to women ratio in those communities‚Ä¶ figured this community would be the most balanced and that i could get good advice here since most people here have been in this situation before anyways. feel free to lmk if this isn‚Äôt allowed tho üòû",2,1760816610.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

I am not a coffee drinker. For one reason only - it gives me the shakes ans anxiety. 

However my entire adult life I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm failing at some kind of cultural movement. It feels like every cafe is based around coffee. 

What‚Äôs so bad about tea? I enjoy English breakfast every day. But it feels like I‚Äôm somehow excluded from some kind of hot drink culture. 

Why? What‚Äôs so special about coffee. What am I missing? Even decaf seems to come with some nose turning.

1oa57r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1oa57r9/the_numbness_just_wore_off/,The numbness JUST wore off,"TLDR: Today, my numbness **wore off**. There were warning signs but today, today I've lost heart. Or, more appropriately, the shield on it. I've been up since a few hours before dawn, crying. I'm utterly lost and destroyed, sinking FAST. I need hope. Please.

I got myself up, dressed, out of the house with dogs in the car as the sun came up, drove around my city with my camera, trying to find something to burn off the painful exercise of doing the activity he encouraged, he supported, after years of letting the creative skill lay fallow (life got in the way, there was just no time for it). I knew I needed to do **something**, needed to not be in the house, needed fresh air, needed to feel what it was like to create without the only real partner I ever had. The one who inspired me, loved me, rejoiced in the hunt with me, looking for something to preserve, something beautiful worthy of notice that perhaps millions would pass by, oblivious. I took a handful of half-hearted images, scurrying from the car where two anxious dogs sat waiting for my return. Maybe this was the experience that kicked out my last safety, because it felt like they were scared I wouldn't come back though they could see me, just feet away, through the windshield. 

The experience was disastrous. So I pointed the car home, to where the house we worked SO HARD to get sat silent, dark, unwelcoming. None of us seemed to want to go in, but I pressed on, pressed in. After a quick bathroom break, the dogs settled and my heart rate started picking up.

I tried to reach out to a friend or two across the country (I know nobody locally), but nobody wants to take this kind of call. So I sat in silence, two cushions down from where I can _so clearly see him_, in his ""command center,"" ready to watch a fun movie or listen to some music. It was like he was really sitting there. Asking if I wanted coffee because I was up so early, like he would do lovingly so many pre-dawn days. 

My feelings started to rush back in yesterday when I received a handwritten sheet of plain paper, half-filled with a scrawl from my biological uncle saying he was sorry it took him so long to reach out, that he wanted to avoid the topic of death, that it was hard for him to talk about, but that he was ""there"" for me, signed with his name and phone number. WTH?! I've never really known this man. I've never really known that part of my biological family at all, save one aunt. But this letter, as sincere as it was brutally honest, ripped away every bandage I had used to make it up to this point.

Oh, GOD!! It's real. **_It's all real!!_**

Now I can't stop crying. I went to bed, took an exhausted nap, awoke sobbing. I don't know what to do, how to manage this. Please don't tell me to call someone, _there isn't anyone_. Please don't tell me to go to therapy, _I did it already_, paid too much money for the privilege of hoodwinking a therapist into thinking she'd done a great job and that she ""wasn't worried"" about me. 

I'm both terrified and suddenly angry. I have proof he knew he was unwell and tried to handle it himself rather than go to a doctor. _My eternal one!_ The heart that beat in **my** chest, he _chose_ not to face it, chose to let his clock wind down and silence. Not that he knew the extent, but surely he understood he was on borrowed time, and he was young, really, should have had decades more! Now I am completely without him, completely raw, feeling VERY present in a life that is suddenly unfamiliar and foreboding. Plus, I see myself. I see how the pain of the last year of his life was misinterpreted. He had withdrawn and in the vacuum of his retreat, I stopped shining for him, lost myself. And now, BAM, here I am, like this, a shadow, a husk, the woman who remains, racked with guilt. 

I keep crying to the dogs, ""I miss Daddy,"" and they just look at me with the same fearful expression they wore in the car at first light as we rattled along the city streets hours earlier. One friend texted me back, apologizing, saying it was a busy day and she was now at a 12-hour movie marathon and couldn't talk. It's the middle of the afternoon in a quiet city and I have no idea how I'm going to get through this day. That denial, that numbness, it has kept me going. I have faced all of this with hope, even just a faint glimmer, in faith that we'll spend eternity together. Today it all changed. I'm begging him to ""come bring me home"" and I feel every second until he does will be spent in thick, **deepening** darkness. 

_How do we survive this?_ How and why?! I have no illusions. Time goes on. There is no second chapter. He was and remains **THE book**. But my heart is shaken and my faith has flickered. Perhaps not gone, but dangerously dimmed. Would some kind soul _please_ share just a little light with me today? Tell me something good, something that either lifted you out of gloom or gave you the strength to pull yourself from the sucking muck that is the loss of your one-and-only? _Please and thank you..._",4,1760816462.0,widowers,2,1.0,False

1oa55a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1oa55a7/clara_wynn/,Clara Wynn,"Title: The Hollow Man of Ashgrove City

Pre-entery.

In the waning days of the 1990s, the city of Ashgrove sits under a veil of neon and rain. Its streets hum with the low buzz of power lines and broken dreams, a city where people disappear, and no one asks why.

When Clara Wynn, a quiet 19-year-old college student, spends a weekend home alone while her parents are away, she expects nothing more than a few nights of solitude. But as the city‚Äôs power flickers and an unfamiliar number begins to call her landline, Clara realizes she isn‚Äôt truly alone.

A man has begun following her. A tall, pale, with eyes that never quite blink and a smile that doesn‚Äôt belong to this world. At first, he seems like a stalker. But soon, the truth becomes impossible to deny: he isn‚Äôt human. He wears human skin like a borrowed coat, mimicking voices, gestures, even memories that aren‚Äôt his own.

As Clara runs through the dark arteries of Ashgrove, from her apartment‚Äôs cracked corridors to the silent subway tunnels and the forgotten riverfront. She begins uncovering the city‚Äôs secret: a rift beneath its foundations where something ancient feeds.

Each step draws her closer to the heart of it  and to the truth about who she really is, and why the demon has chosen her.

Visceral. Relentless. Drenched in dread.
The Hollow Man of Ashgrove City is a descent into urban isolation and supernatural horror.   A story of survival, courage, and the thin, trembling line between the living and the hollow.

Chapter I

My name is Clara Wynn, and I‚Äôve told this story a hundred times to detectives, to journalists, to strangers who call me brave, to others who call me delusional.
But I only ever tell the truth.
And the truth is that I should have died that night in Ashgrove City.

It started on a Friday, October 17th, 1997. The kind of night that sits wet and heavy on your skin. The city had that low hum again, that static electricity that makes you feel like a storm is watching you. My parents had gone to visit my aunt in Clearwater, a three-hour drive away. I was nineteen, in my second year of college, and convinced I could handle being alone for the weekend.

Our apartment was on the twelfth floor of the Marroway Complex, an old brick building that used to be a hotel before the renovations. You could still feel the bones of its past, the faded floral wallpaper under layers of paint, the echo of doors that didn‚Äôt exist anymore.

I spent the early part of the evening cleaning, making popcorn, and watching reruns of The X-Files. The city lights outside my window looked like stars drowned in dirty water. I remember thinking it was comforting being up high, untouchable.

Then, around 9:46 p.m., the phone rang.

Not my cell, the landline.
The one no one ever used.

I almost didn‚Äôt answer it. I wish I hadn‚Äôt.

When I picked up, there was a man‚Äôs voice. Calm. Polite.
He said, ‚ÄúIs this Miss Wynn?‚Äù

I said yes. He paused.. too long and then said, ‚ÄúYou should really lock your window.‚Äù

I laughed, thinking it was someone from college pulling a prank. But something about his tone‚Ä¶
It wasn‚Äôt teasing. It wasn‚Äôt even threatening.
It was observant.

I looked over at the living room window, the one that faced the street. The curtains were half-drawn. I couldn‚Äôt see much beyond the glass, just the faint reflection of my own face.

When I turned back, the line had gone dead.

I stood there for a while, holding the phone, listening to the dial tone. Then I hung up, locked the window, and tried to laugh it off.

But the thing about laughter, it doesn‚Äôt chase fear away. It just gives it a place to hide.

It was an hour later when I saw him.

I had gone to the kitchen for another soda, the TV still murmuring in the background. The lights flickered the way they always did when the elevator ran. But this time, the power didn‚Äôt come back right away.

Through the brief slice of darkness, I caught something at the corner of the window. A silhouette.
A tall figure standing across the street under the orange streetlight, his face tilted upward staring directly at my floor.

When the power came back, I thought I‚Äôd imagined it. But he was still there. Still staring.

I remember whispering, ‚ÄúJesus, who are you?‚Äù

And for a moment, I thought he answered.
Not through the glass. Not through the air.
But inside my head.
A voice that wasn‚Äôt mine, soft and deliberate: ‚ÄúYou already know.‚Äù

I stumbled back and knocked the soda off the counter. When I looked again, he was gone.

That should‚Äôve been the end of it. I should‚Äôve called someone, the police, my parents, anyone. But I didn‚Äôt.
Because part of me, the rational part, still believed I was being paranoid.

I went to bed around midnight. The city rain had turned to mist, sliding down the window like slow tears. I left my desk lamp on, because the dark didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore.

I woke up just after 2 a.m. to a sound.
three slow knocks on my apartment door.

Not frantic. Not random.
Measured.
Knock... knock... knock.

My heart was beating so hard it hurt. I slipped out of bed, padded across the carpet, and pressed my ear against the door.

A man‚Äôs voice came through, muffled by the wood.
‚ÄúClara? It‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs your dad. I forgot my keys.‚Äù

Every part of me went cold.
Because my father‚Äôs voice was right, pitch-perfect.
But my parents were in Clearwater.

And then came the sound that still wakes me sometimes, the sound of metal scraping slowly against the lock.

He wasn‚Äôt knocking anymore.
He was trying to open the door.


I backed away, too afraid to breathe. Then I remembered the window. I thought maybe I could call for help, wave down a neighbor, anything. I ran to the living room and yanked the curtain aside.

And there he was.

The same man I‚Äôd seen under the streetlight.
Only now he was on the fire escape, his pale hands pressed against the glass.

His face.
God, his face wasn‚Äôt right. The skin was too tight, the smile too wide, and when he blinked, it looked painful, like a habit he didn‚Äôt fully understand.

He whispered something I couldn‚Äôt hear, but I swear I felt it in my bones, the same voice that had spoken inside my head.
‚ÄúLet me in, Clara. You called me.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt remember calling anyone.
But in that moment, as he pressed his face to the glass, I realized something awful.
He didn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôd called him on the phone.
He meant something else. Something older.

And when I blinked, he was gone.

That was the night it began.
The night the city stopped feeling like home.
The night I learned that some doors, once noticed, can never be unseen again.

Chapter II 

I didn‚Äôt sleep after that.
I sat on the couch until dawn, watching the window and waiting for the first gray light to bleed into the room. The city always feels quieter at sunrise like the world takes a breath before it remembers how to live again.

When I finally stepped outside, everything looked painfully normal.
The streets were slick from last night‚Äôs rain, buses hissed past, and old men in coats smoked by the corner store. No one looked at me twice. No one looked up at the twelfth floor.

I almost convinced myself it had been a dream. Almost.

But then, across the street, I saw a reflection in the caf√© window, a tall shape in a dark coat, motionless amid the blur of morning commuters. When I turned to look, there was no one there.
Just that faint shimmer in the glass, still holding its shape.

That was when I realized something strange:
The reflection wasn‚Äôt of a man.
It was of something standing behind me.

I spun around, nothing.
But the cold that followed felt alive, like a hand brushing the back of my neck.

I spent the next two days trying to drown myself in routine. Schoolwork, errands, anything to make me feel ordinary again. I even told a friend, Lydia, about the call, about the man I thought I‚Äôd seen. She laughed nervously, said I probably watched too many horror movies, and told me to ‚Äúget out more.‚Äù

That night, she invited me to meet her at a bar near Old Market Square, a place with cheap beer and worse lighting.
I remember hesitating, staring at my phone, trying to decide whether leaving my apartment would make me safer or put me closer to him.
In the end, I went because being alone felt worse.

The city was alive that night. Horns, laughter, the hum of televisions behind open windows.
But beneath it all, there was a pulse I couldn‚Äôt shake. A rhythm just out of sync with the city‚Äôs heartbeat. Like something else was breathing through it.

When I reached the bar, Lydia was already there, waving from the booth near the jukebox. We talked for an hour about nothing, everything, anything but him. I almost felt normal again.

Then I saw him through the window.

Standing across the street, under the neon sign of a pawn shop.
Still. Watching.

I blinked and he was gone.
But a moment later, the payphone outside the bar rang.

No one was near it.
Yet it rang and rang until I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore.

Lydia frowned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it,‚Äù she said. But I did.
I walked outside and lifted the receiver.

No sound. Just breathing.
Then a whisper, soft enough to feel like it came from behind me instead of through the phone:
‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have left the window open.‚Äù

I dropped the receiver and ran.

I don‚Äôt remember much of the run home, just flashes.
Rain starting again. A flickering streetlight that went dark as I passed. Footsteps that weren‚Äôt mine, echoing just a beat too late.

When I reached my building, the lobby lights were out.
The elevator was broken, its doors half-open like a mouth frozen mid-scream. I took the stairs two at a time. My key slipped twice in the lock before the door gave way.

Inside, the apartment was dark except for the faint glow from the city below. I shut the door, bolted it, and pressed my back to it, gasping.

That‚Äôs when I heard the television turn on by itself.

The screen glowed blue, no sound, no channel just static. I hadn‚Äôt touched the remote. It lay on the coffee table where I‚Äôd left it that morning.
And then, through the static, a figure appeared. 
Blurry, moving closer to the camera, until I could see eyes. My eyes.

It was me on the screen.
Only I wasn‚Äôt moving the way I moved.
My reflection smiled when I didn‚Äôt. It lifted its hand, palm to the glass, like a mirror trying to escape.

The phone rang again.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.
Instead, I unplugged it, ripped the cord from the wall, and still it kept ringing.

That‚Äôs when I realized it wasn‚Äôt coming from the phone.
It was coming from inside the television.

And through the crackling static, that same voice whispered, closer than before:
‚ÄúYou called me, Clara. You wanted to be seen.‚Äù

The room went dark.

When the lights came back, it was morning again.
My front door stood open.
And on the carpet, in front of it, was a single wet footprint, long, bare, and facing inward.

That was the moment I stopped believing I was losing my mind.
Because madness doesn‚Äôt leave footprints.

Chapter III

I didn‚Äôt leave my apartment for three days.
Every sound in the hallway made my heart trip over itself, the clatter of pipes, the buzz of the elevator cables, the whisper of someone‚Äôs shoes on the linoleum.

But the silence was worse.

By the fourth morning, I realized that fear was starting to feel like oxygen, I could only breathe if it was around. And that terrified me more than him.

So I left.

The air outside smelled like rust and rain. I kept my head down as I walked, counting cracks in the sidewalk like prayers. I wasn‚Äôt sure where I was going until I found myself standing in front of the Ashgrove Public Library, a place that hadn‚Äôt changed since I was a kid, tall windows, dust thick enough to see your reflection in it.

Inside, it was quiet in that particular way old buildings are quiet. Where the air feels full of whispers that never learned to fade.

I went to the archives desk and asked for anything about the Marroway Complex, the building where I lived. The clerk, a thin woman with silver glasses, frowned.
‚ÄúYou live there?‚Äù she asked, as if I‚Äôd said I lived inside a grave.

When she returned, she set down a single box. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all that‚Äôs left,‚Äù she said, and wouldn‚Äôt meet my eyes.

The files smelled like mildew and secrets.
Newspaper clippings from the 1950s and 60s, when the building was still the Marroway Hotel. A few yellowed photographs. And a single incident report dated October 17, 1959.

The headline read:
 ‚ÄúMissing Woman Last Seen at Marroway Hotel, Witness Claims She Spoke to Herself in the Mirror.‚Äù

I felt my stomach twist. October 17th ‚Äî the same date everything had started for me.

The article said the woman‚Äôs name was Elena Wynn.
Wynn.
My last name.

At first I thought it had to be a coincidence. But as I read further, the coincidence turned into something colder. Elena was nineteen. She‚Äôd been staying alone while her parents were away. She‚Äôd told a friend that a man kept calling her, a man who spoke in her father‚Äôs voice.

The last line of the article was short, almost casual:

‚ÄúHotel room found empty. One set of wet footprints discovered near the window.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember leaving the library.
One moment I was staring at that headline; the next I was outside again, the city noise pressing in like water against glass.

I must‚Äôve walked for hours, not really seeing where I was going. Every window seemed to hold a reflection that didn‚Äôt move when I did. Every sound felt like footsteps a few beats behind me.

When I finally stopped, I was standing at the edge of Riverside District, the oldest part of Ashgrove. Where the city had been built on top of itself, layer after forgotten layer.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it again.
My name.

Soft, like someone exhaling it just beside my ear.

I turned and saw him halfway across the street, between two flickering lamps. The Hollow Man.

He looked the same, but worse. His outline was starting to blur, like the air around him was bending. His head tilted, and though he was too far to touch me, I felt a pressure against my chest, like fingers pressing down through the air.

I whispered, ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù

He smiled.
‚ÄúTo finish what was started.‚Äù

And then he was gone. Not vanished, exactly, but unmade, like he‚Äôd been swallowed by the city‚Äôs light.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt go back to the apartment. I found myself at Lydia‚Äôs door instead, shaking and half-delirious. She didn‚Äôt ask questions, just pulled me in and locked the door behind me.

Over tea, I told her everything about the calls, the man, the name in the newspaper. When I said ‚ÄúElena Wynn,‚Äù her expression changed.

‚ÄúClara,‚Äù she said slowly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that name. There‚Äôs a mural downtown, old, faded thing under the overpass near Ashgrove Station. People say it‚Äôs haunted. The woman in the painting‚Ä¶ she looks like you.‚Äù

We went there the next day.
The mural was half-hidden under graffiti and grime, painted on cracked brick. The colors had bled together over decades, but the face, the face was unmistakable.
She looked exactly like me.

In her painted eyes, someone had scratched three words:
‚ÄúSHE CALLED HIM.‚Äù

And beneath that, in newer paint, almost fresh:
‚ÄúAND HE ANSWERED.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how long we stood there.
But when we turned to leave, I noticed something I hadn‚Äôt before, on the far side of the underpass, someone had drawn the outline of a man. No details, just a hollow shape in black paint.

And from where I stood, it seemed to line up perfectly with the shadow that fell across me.

I started to believe then that Ashgrove wasn‚Äôt just haunted.
It was watching.
Like the city itself was waiting for me to remember something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to forget.

Chapter IV

The night after I found the mural, I dreamed of water.
Black water, rippling under street-lights that floated like dying stars. A woman‚Äôs face looked up from beneath the surface. My face, but older and when her mouth opened, the city lights went out one by one.

I woke to Lydia shaking me. ‚ÄúYou were talking in your sleep,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúYou kept saying his name.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know his name,‚Äù I said.
She just stared at me. ‚ÄúYou said Hollow. Over and over.‚Äù

By morning I couldn‚Äôt stay still. There were too many fragments that didn‚Äôt fit: Elena Wynn, the Marroway, the mural. They were all pieces of a story that felt half-remembered, half-inherited.

I went back to the library, but the archive box was gone. The clerk with the silver glasses wasn‚Äôt there either. A younger man filled her place, and when I asked about the Marroway files he blinked at me like I‚Äôd spoken another language.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt keep anything that old anymore,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThose records were destroyed years ago.‚Äù

I felt the world tilt. ‚ÄúI was just here. Three days ago. The files were real.‚Äù
He only frowned. ‚ÄúThe Marroway? That building‚Äôs been empty since the fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúFire?‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúBack in the seventies. Whole top floors burned out. No one‚Äôs lived there since.‚Äù

I left without another word.
Outside, the city looked wrong, angles sharper, air heavier. People moved like clockwork figures, never looking at me directly. For a moment, I thought I could see their reflections in the glass storefronts turning a fraction slower than they did.

At the bus stop, a pay-phone rang.
No one else turned.

I picked it up before I could think.

‚ÄúClara,‚Äù the voice said.
Not his voice. A woman‚Äôs. Soft, tremulous.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go back there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

The line hissed. Then, faintly, ‚ÄúHe remembers the fire.‚Äù

Click.

Lydia met me at the end of East Riverside, where the oldest tunnels cut beneath the city. She had found a map online, the old subway lines that had been sealed after a cave-in decades ago. One line ran directly under the Marroway site.

‚ÄúWhatever he is,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúmaybe that‚Äôs where he came from.‚Äù

The tunnel mouth gaped behind a rusted gate. We slipped through. The air smelled of iron and rot. Our flashlights shook in our hands.

The deeper we went, the more the city above seemed to fade. Drips echoed like footsteps. A low hum threaded the darkness, steady, living.

Then Lydia stopped.
‚ÄúDo you see that?‚Äù

At the far end of the tunnel, light pulsed faintly  a sickly, blue-white glow. As we neared it, shapes appeared on the wall: dozens of faces painted in ash, each one identical to the woman from the mural. Each one identical to me.

In the center of the wall, a hollow outline of a man had been carved directly into the stone.

From within it, water seeped black and slow, forming a pool at our feet.

And in that water, a reflection moved.
Not mine.
His.

The voice rose from the tunnel itself.
‚ÄúYou came home.‚Äù

Lydia screamed. I grabbed her arm and ran, the light behind us flaring until it burned white. The sound followed not footsteps, but breathing, close enough that the air trembled against my back.

We didn‚Äôt stop until we burst into the night again, lungs raw, the gate clanging shut behind us.

When we looked back, the tunnel was dark, silent, as if nothing had ever been there.

But Lydia‚Äôs flashlight, the one she‚Äôd dropped, lay just inside the gate, still on.
Its beam pointed down at the ground.

A single wet footprint.
Facing outward this time.

That was the night I understood the truth:
He wasn‚Äôt haunting me because of who I was.
He was haunting me because of where I came from.

And the city, my city was helping him remember.

My route was taking the footpath opposite the Blue Lion pub in Hardwick through the fields down to Long Road, through Coton, over the M11 foot/bike bridge, and down the side of the west cambridge campus into the backs, and over the bridge by Trinity college, into the market and down petty cury.  
  
I subsequently ran on from there to Coffee World in Milton via King Street, the bridge by midsummer house, past the coop and along the A-10. I am +90% certain that I didn't have the stuffie when I was in Boots, so I think that's much less likely.

1oa4xwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/random_username/comments/1oa4xwn/hi/,Hi,"What the hell is an ""Inside Musician""?

It‚Äôs definitely not what it sounds like. It‚Äôs not about being ""in the know"" or having industry connections. My ""industry"" is the twelve square feet of my bedroom, currently occupied by a half-dismantled drum machine and a coffee mug that‚Äôs seen things.

No, I think being an Inside Musician is about a specific kind of orientation to the whole messy act of making music. It's a state of being.

Think about the archetypes we celebrate. The ""Outsider."" The bedroom pop prodigy who blows up on a viral clip. Their magic is their rawness, their untamed, almost accidental brilliance. They're a force of nature. We love them because they seem to operate on pure feeling, untouched by the grubby hands of theory or technique. Their instrument is their intuition.

The Inside Musician is the opposite. We are not a force of nature; we are the cartographers, meticulously mapping the terrain. Our instrument is our obsession.

Let me give you some symptoms. You might be an Inside Musician if:

¬∑ You‚Äôve ever spent a full Saturday afternoon trying to sample the ""perfect"" sound of a creaking floorboard, running it through five different granular synths, only to end up with a texture you'll probably never use in a track. But the search was the point.
¬∑ You hear a song from the 70s and your brain doesn't just recall the melody; it immediately visualizes the specific model of tape machine they used, the likely microphone on the vocal, and you get a weird, nostalgic pang for a recording process you never actually experienced.
¬∑ The most satisfying musical moment of your week wasn't a catchy chorus you wrote, but the moment you finally, finally nailed the side-chain compression on your kick drum so it doesn't pump, but just‚Ä¶ breathes. It‚Äôs a victory no one will ever notice, but to you, it‚Äôs everything.
¬∑ You have a deeper emotional relationship with the ""save"" button on your DAW than with most of your playlist on Spotify.

Our stage isn't a stage. It's the cave. The glow of the screen. The weight of the headphones. The audience is the ghost in the machine, the Platonic ideal of the song you're trying to capture, which is always, frustratingly, just out of reach. The applause is that split second of silence after you render a track, where for a single, fleeting moment, it doesn't sound like a collection of tracks, but like a single, living thing. And then you hear the bass is slightly out of tune.

This is a deeply weird and lonely way to live sometimes.

You go to a party and someone asks what you do. ""I'm a musician,"" you say. ""Oh, cool! Play any shows?"" ""Uh, not lately."" ""Spotify?"" ""Well, I've got some demos on SoundCloud..."" You see their eyes glaze over. They're looking for the Outside Musician, the one with the stories of the road and the crowd-surfing. They don't want to hear about your spiritual journey with a parametric EQ. So you learn to shut up. You retreat back inside.

It‚Äôs easy to feel like an artifact. A ghost. In a culture that values the finished product, the brand, the aesthetic, the viral moment, what is the place for someone who is fixated on the infinitesimal space between the notes? Who finds more meaning in the process than the outcome?

But here‚Äôs the thought I‚Äôve been clinging to, the one that makes this feel less like a pathology and more like a purpose.

The lightning bolt of inspiration is a beautiful, chaotic, divine event. It‚Äôs necessary. The world needs its Outsiders. But lightning, by itself, is destructive. It strikes and it's gone.

The Inside Musician doesn't catch the lightning. We don't even try. We study the atmosphere. We build the lightning rod. We design the systems to capture that raw, untamable energy and channel it, ground it, transform it into something that can power a city. We are the engineers of the sublime.

We are the reason a feeling can be translated into a specific arrangement of frequencies and waveforms that can, decades later, make a stranger on the other side of the world feel that same feeling. That‚Äôs not magic. That‚Äôs craft. That‚Äôs a deep, patient, often frustrating love for the hidden architecture of sound itself.

So, to all of you out there in your own caves, tuning your snare drums for the tenth hour, wrestling with a vocal take that‚Äôs 99% there but needs that last 1%, obsessing over the harmonic series of a sub-bass note that most people will only feel in their chest...

You are not just ""producers"" or ""engineers"" or ""bedroom artists."" You are Inside Musicians. You are the keepers of the quiet fire. The world runs on the music you help shape, even if it never knows your name. The depth you pour into your work is the foundation that keeps the entire edifice from collapsing into a TikTok trend.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go. I just got a new plugin that emulates a plate reverb from 1962, and I have some very important, deeply unproductive listening to do.",1,1760815828.0,random_username,0,1.0,False

awareness"")

The level of delusion is crazy. "" He/she actually left early‚òùüèªü§ì"" or ""they didn't drink unlike the X idol!"" Or ""Look at your fav! He was literally dancing!? My fav was just standing in a corner! Omg he's so respectful ü•∫""

And don't even get me started on how some of the idol/ actors did the bare minimum like mentioning a single Sentence about BC or wearing a pink dress and then y'all are hyping them up like gods just because they are a tiny bit better than the other gone case ones. Please touch some grass.

They are humans, not literal gods. They can do wrong things. You don't have to compare about how your idol was better than another idol js to prove that your ""oppa"" or ""unnie"" didn't do anything wrong. ü§ì

The main issue was that EVERYONE present at that event was so wrong to not speak up or just attend the event in the first place. The W party isn't a new thing. Everyone knows it's just for the celeb meetup and not actually about the BC awareness. Your favs, who literally live in korea, would obviously know that. Yet, they choose to attend it. But some of yall which completely sideline this and choose to focus on convincing others how your fav was the least bad out of them.

If they had chose to just spread awareness atleast in the interviews, no one would have beat them up or anything. They had a choice, and they didn't take it.

As i saw in some post recently, it's giving just like the üáµüá∏ situation,where some fans absolutely refuse to agree that your idol did anything wrong. ""But he didn't know about üáµüá∏! ü•∫"" Or ""look at your idol, she literally did a coca cola ad, mine atleast just mentioned starbucks in her live! She has no option, she had to drink coffee!""

Bluewood State Park 
(A reimagining of The Rake by the 4Chan community of 2005)

June 11th: 
My therapist recommended I start keeping a daily journal, and I have no reason not to with a job that has no internet or TV. So, hi. I guess‚Ä¶ how the hell do people write journals? I don‚Äôt know, guess I'll just act like I'm talking to someone, it‚Äôs the best I can do. 

My name is Linus Barnes, and I work as a park ranger. I‚Äôve recently been moved out to Bluewood State Park, out in northern California. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs called Bluewood, the trees aren‚Äôt blue, nothing really is. Maybe it‚Äôs just the people naming it wanting to parody redwood, probably out of jealousy. This place isn‚Äôt a giant park made to protect a rare species, it‚Äôs a small woodland where teens and college students like to get wasted (leaving trash everywhere by the way) and crackheads go to make shitty shelters. It‚Äôs a garbage park, essentially. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone besides the rangers have been out here sober for years, hell I think half of the rangers here aren‚Äôt sober either. Guess they figure if the guests are wasted half the time they get to indulge as well.  I literally only came here because they were desperate for new rangers that weren‚Äôt passed out before 9pm. Thank god I‚Äôm both sober and practically nocturnal.

Oh yeah, I guess I should say why I‚Äôve begun writing this in the first place.

I‚Äôve had sleeping problems for years now, it‚Äôs why I moved to the night shifts. I really just sleep in the early morning, and stay awake from 2pm to 7am. I don‚Äôt know how it happens, like at all. I went to a buncha doctors, they all say it‚Äôs either my previous dependence on caffeine, or stress, or trauma, or all three. 

All I know is that it makes me perfect for night watch, and Bluewood needs night watchers. This journal was recommended by my therapist, maybe to tire me out or destress me. I‚Äôm not sure, maybe she‚Äôs just a hack and I'm writing this for no reason.  Guess only time will tell, so see you next time. 

June 12th:	
Bluewood is strange. Also hello, or whatever. I still don‚Äôt know how to write unless I just talk to this damn book. Guess it‚Äôs a surrogate for having someone to talk to‚Ä¶ God that sounds depressing when I write it out. I made my own breakfast today instead of eating another gas station sandwich. It wasn‚Äôt much better, and I still ended up stopping there for coffee before work. 

	I met the guy who does the morning shift in the cabin, tower, thing. It‚Äôs an old firewatch tower that we‚Äôve repurposed to be a ranger station, though I suppose it could still be a firewatch tower if I happen to see one and have to call it in. 

	Anyway, I met Tom, the day shift worker. He‚Äôs an okay guy, kinda chipper. I guess you‚Äôd have to be to work day, maybe it‚Äôs some kind of spiritual thing. My cynical a## is stuck with nights while human sunshine takes over in morning. Anyway, we got to talking a bit since I showed up early and he wasn't busy. Usually I'm not very talkative, but Tom‚Äôs energy got me yapping with him. Can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôve seen him before, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to remember me if I did. 

	According to Tom, there used to be a cult around the Bluewood area. Or at least another watchman told him that, who also heard it from another watchman. Supposedly they just kinda wandered around the park a lot, wearing masks and spooking the guests. I think it‚Äôs just a story to scare new hires, y‚Äôknow like saying that someone saw bigfoot or the goatman out in the woods. Or maybe a hitchhiker disappeared before their eyes, or heard a voice that wasn't quite human. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs all just bullshit. Stuff to keep you awake and aware. 

	The tower‚Ä¶ cabin? The cabin tower is pretty nice. Rustic isn‚Äôt really my cup of tea, but it wears it really well. Everything is wooden,  no modern tech for miles. My phone is basically a brick out here, and my only contact is a small radio where I can report things to the other night watchers, or my supervisors. There‚Äôs a few trail cameras set up around various areas, and monitors for viewing them in the cabin tower. 

	Nothing really happened, I didn't even see a guest do something stupid, just meander around. But more than that all there was was silence. Make me kinda uneasy, but sure I‚Äôll get used to it. New place, new nerves, it‚Äôs a cyclical thing. I wrote my last journal entry while waiting for something to happen. I should get some books or something, maybe a radio for music?

	Guess I‚Äôll just have to see, talk to you next time. 

June 22nd:
	So, Bluewood might‚Äôve just gotten interesting. Also sorry for not writing, forgot to‚Ä¶ like alot

	I talked with Tom again, he‚Äôs pretty much the only human I‚Äôve spoken to the past few days, I don‚Äôt have much in the way of a social life if you couldn‚Äôt tell. Anyway, we talked about the weirdest things we‚Äôve seen on shifts. Tom‚Äôs were pretty average, usual drunk people doing stupid shit, or on a good day a streaker. I told him about how a few months ago I thought I saw a two headed deer. Tom thought I was bullshitting him, but said I was pretty convincing. Then he brought up another story, one another night shifter told him. Guy had worked here for maybe a week before quitting because of this, but Tom and I agree he probably was just a lunatic. He claimed one night, from the trail cam just above a small cave, he saw what looked like a dude with big hands climb out of the mouth, and run into the woods on all fours

	Tom said he tried to tell this dude it was probably just some camera trick, but apparently he was dedicated to his story. 

	The cave in question is called Broksman Cave, after this random guy who found it. It was a spelunking cave for a while, but they shut it down after too many people got stuck and died. According to Tom, the old night shifter said the big hand thing is what was killing people. But the whole thing about Broksman, at least from what I‚Äôve heard, is that it's basically all crawlspaces and dead ends.

	We concluded the conversation with an agreement that the old night shifter was a crackhead, and spelunking is stupid. Nothing interesting happened on my shift, just a few drunk college students throwing cans everywhere that I had to call in. Bluewood really needs to invest in better, less hoppable fences.

	I knew it was bull, but I kept thinking about that story of the thing that crawled out of Broksman. Something about it freaked me out a bit, maybe it was just me imagining seeing it for myself. It was enticing at the same time. Like, if I saw it I could regale Tom with how the monster was real. Or at the very least it would make staring at the same 8 trail cameras less ass numbingly boring. I don‚Äôt know, all I know is that I kept my eye on the cave‚Äôs mouth, just in case. 

	I think I‚Äôm gonna do just fine in Bluewood. Talk to you next time. 

June 24th:
	Woke up early today, but early for me is 12:30 in the morning. I went on a quick jog, it was awful. I haven‚Äôt jogged or much less run for years now, yet I still look like I could fall over in the wind. Maybe it‚Äôs just metabolism, or maybe I just don‚Äôt eat enough. Can‚Äôt think of the last time I had three meals in one day.

	I didn't see Tom before work, which made me a bit sad. Our quick convos before my shift are usually the best part of my day. Maybe I should ask if he‚Äôd be willing to exchange numbers. Though, with us working opposite shifts and the cabin tower having no signal, I probably shouldn‚Äôt bother. 

	I saw a buck today, probably‚Ä¶ 20 points? 18? I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt hunt. It was big though, don‚Äôt see many big ones around here. Besides that, only another frat bro who threw up in a bush. Dickhead. 

	That‚Äôs all for now I guess, talk to you later. 


June 30th:
	I really need to be more consistent with these. My therapist thinks weekly entries should do fine, so I‚Äôll shoot for that. No promises though,  non-existent person I‚Äôm writing to. I still don‚Äôt think this will help my sleeping schedule. 

	I actually slept at night on my day off, and it was awful. I woke up at like, 4 am and couldn‚Äôt move, at all. I tried, I really did, but it's like my mind was disconnected from my body. I had to just lay there, seeing‚Ä¶ things. I swear I saw that two headed deer in my window, just staring at me. I tried speaking, yelling, anything. But it was like my jaw had been super glued shut. It took minutes for me to be able to sit up, and by then the deer was long gone.  My doctors said it was sleep paralysis, and I shouldn‚Äôt try to sleep at night again. Something about my condition making me more susceptible to it. 

	I saw Tom again, we talked but just very quickly. He actually suggested one of us get a wifi router set up in the cabin tower. I said it‚Äôd be a game of who‚Äôd want to pay for it first. Besides that, just a bit of nonchalant small talk. It was nice to see him again though. 

	I know you‚Äôre not gonna believe me, even though you‚Äôre an inanimate object, but this is the weirdest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. 

	I was looking at the trail cams, just trying not be bored out of my fucking skull, when one of them turned suddenly. It was like someone grabbed the band attaching it to the tree and spun it to the other side. I tried calling it in, but they said it was  probably ‚ÄúJust a raccoon‚Äù. I thought it was bullshit but moved on and just kept looking at the cameras.

	But at some point, it started turning back. I looked closer at it, and swore I saw‚Ä¶ fingers. Like, four fingers in the corner turning the camera. They were pale, almost paper like, with dirty nails barely visible on the end. It was maybe a few seconds, just enough to get an idea of what they could be but it freaked me the fuck out.

	Later, I went into the bathroom for‚Ä¶ bathroom things. As I was looking in the mirror, checking if my eye bags had gotten any larger, I noticed a small corner of paper behind the frame. I pulled it out, and it was a drawing. It was scribbled on notebook paper with a pencil, and showed a‚Ä¶ thing.

	It had a humanish body, but had much longer limbs. Like, too long. It had only four, long fingers on each hand, with a small thumb. Its head was either scribbled out or just shadowed, but I could just make out its eyes. They were just little white circles, staring me down. Underneath the doodle was just two words, written like scratchy, like someone was ultra pissed writing them. I could just barely make them out.

‚ÄúThe Rake.‚Äù

	I figured the old nightshifter made it, but it still put me on edge looking at it. I put it in my pocket and went back to work, but didn‚Äôt look at the Broksman camera for the entire night. I‚Äôm sure you could guess why. 

	It‚Äôs strange though. I‚Äôm scared more than I‚Äôve been at any other park, but I also feel‚Ä¶ like intrigued. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I just need sleep. That much is obvious. Talk at you again.

	
July 7th: 
I forgot about the drawing completely. Just emptied my work pockets and found it again. Think it‚Äôs time to go play detective. I‚Äôm going to ask Anna, my primary supervisor, who the old night watcher was. See you then. 


July 8th:
	Anna was‚Ä¶ helpful. Mostly

	I drove down to her office an hour before work, and by office I really mean cabin. The forest service office in Bluewood is just as rustic as its ranger stations. I am beginning to think the rangers don‚Äôt think of fire hazards very often. Maybe it‚Äôs intentional, and they‚Äôre just waiting for Bluewood to burn down so they can go to an actual national park. Too bad not many guests are arsonists. 

	Anyway, I asked to speak with Anna. When I got to her office, the face she gave me radiated the impression she thought this could‚Äôve just been an email. 

	When I asked about the previous night watchers in my cabin tower, she rolled her eyes, asked if ‚ÄúTom was still telling people that story?‚Äù

	I confirmed, explaining how I had found the picture behind the mirror. I placed it on her desk, sliding it over for her to see. She barely glanced at it, grumbling under her breath. She reached back into a box, where she pulled out maybe a dozen other similar pictures. 

	‚ÄúHe's been doing this for years.‚Äù she said, ‚Äúleaving them in the watchtower or mailing them to me. It‚Äôs been really pissing me off.‚Äù 

	Feeling like a royal moron, I took the drawing back and awkwardly apologized. 

	Before I left, she stopped me in the doorway. She took a long drag off her cigarette, she‚Äôd been smoking since before I got there, giving credence to my fire hazard theory. 

	‚ÄúGeorge Fredrick‚Äôs was crazy, not well in the head,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúHe was on a lot of different meds back then, maybe even taking something extra if you know what I mean. He had hallucinations a lot during his shifts, always ranting and raving about‚Ä¶ that thing.‚Äù

	She took another drag,, ‚ÄúBut, he‚Äôs not the first to see it. It‚Äôs kind of Bluewood's own cryptid, people‚Äôve been yammering about it for decades. Completely sane people mind you.‚Äù

	I sat back down as she continued, ‚ÄúNow I think it‚Äôs all bullshit, personally. But I‚Äôve seen a lot more night watchers leave than the day ones. Tom‚Äôs been working there for years, but everyone else quits within weeks. To be honest you‚Äôre one of the more persistent.‚Äù

	She put out her cigarette, before looking me in the eyes. 

	‚ÄúBut Linus, if you don‚Äôt want to stay up there, tell me, and in two weeks you‚Äôll be out. No questions, no nothing.‚Äù

	I thought about it, for only a moment though. I couldn‚Äôt, this was the job I was made for. Not only that, but this was the only interesting thing I‚Äôd heard or seen of in years. The idea of seeing a monster to break up the boring ass drunk people and average wildlife, I couldn‚Äôt pass that up. 

	I declined, but thanked her for her time. Then I went to work, where I‚Äôm now writing this. I don‚Äôt know if I made the right decision, only time will tell. 

	Till next time Noodle. 

July 16th: 
	I haven‚Äôt seen it for days, The Rake or whatever it really was. I‚Äôm beginning to think I was just crazy. Maybe it was just my brain coming up with something to entertain me, since there had been nothing remotely of interest lately. Brains can do that if you stare at the same thing long enough. It‚Äôs really easy to get so bored your brain will just show you a ghost if you think about it enough. And sure as shit I‚Äôm staring at the same thing down here, but I‚Äôm not seeing any ghosts. 

	Sleep hasn't gotten better. 7 years of this shit now, happy anniversary I guess. I requested an extra day off before my scheduled one. I‚Äôm gonna go try to forget, it‚Äôs the day I always do. 

	I wish you were here, life‚Äôs too damn dull without you. 

July 19th: 
	This might be the strangest thing I‚Äôve seen in forever, though I‚Äôve been saying that since I‚Äôve been working in Bluewood. 

	On my drive to the Tower, I saw a tree with giant scratches all over it. I had to pull over to get a closer look. It was covered in four deep cuts in a row, about as deep as a coin. They were all over, like something was clawing at it. Logic may have said bear or even crazy person with a knife, but something else in me disagreed. 

	Just as I was about to call the wrecked tree in, I heard something. I know by now you think I‚Äôm nuts, but I heard a loud ass noise. It was like a howl, or maybe a scream? Look, I don't even know how to describe it. It didn‚Äôt sound like an animal, or like a human. It was almost, like something in between, if that makes sense. Regardless. reported the tree and went to the cabin tower.

	I asked Tom about the sound, and he said he heard it too. He thought it could have been some weird kind of elk or deer. Apparently they can make howlish noises if they‚Äôre motivated enough. I agreed with him, mostly so he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy. Maybe he wouldn‚Äôt, but I'd prefer to keep the only friend I know. Need someone to talk to, or someone else atleast. I forget that you‚Äôre not her sometimes.  

	Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid, but I think you know what I think the noise was. 

July 20th:
	I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Maybe I am, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm panicking writing this, up here in the Cabin Tower. My hands are fucking shaking I swear, Jesus I need to calm down. 

	Okay, it was like 1am or something. I was looking at the cameras, looking for something, anything. It was driving me crazy. At some point I just kept staring at the Broksman camera. Looking for that stupid Rake thing. Then the camera went out. Like, it didn‚Äôt run out of batteries, it was broken. I didn‚Äôt see something hit it, but it would fucking tell me if it was running out of battery, it wouldn‚Äôt just shut down. It had to have been broken, right?

	 Before calling it in, and decided right then and there I had to go down there. I called in the broken camera, and told whoever else was night watching I was going down to Broksman. They were nonchalant, just telling me to bring the gun, a crappy little rifle used to keep wild animals away, along with bear spray. I packed it all up, sprinted down the tower. I just about tripped and ate shit on the last step. I kept running until I got to Broksman.

	I don‚Äôt know what I expected. I don‚Äôt know if I thought I‚Äôd find The Rake or whatever and put the mystery to rest, or if I was just so bored that a camera having a can thrown at it by the resident idiot was worth this effort. I don‚Äôt know, all I know is what I found. I got to the trail camera, and sure enough it was broken. It had been smashed by something, though I couldn't find a rock or branch or anything that could have done it. My heart raced, and all I could think of was going into the cave.

	Ignoring the stories of all the people who had died down  there, I crawled into Broksman. I didn‚Äôt go very deep down, but I found‚Ä¶ a skinned deer. Like, a full ass buck, skinned and gutted. Its blood was everywhere, pooling in the cracks and crevices of the cave. Its eyes were still open, just staring at me. I don‚Äôt know what could have done this, some sick prankster or dumb hunter or squatter, but I crawled my ass right back out of that hell hole.

	It had to be it, The Rake, it just had to. I‚Äôm writing this in the Cabin Tower, I‚Äôve just reported the deer. My heart feels like it will hop into my throat. I feel like I‚Äôm being watched, like it‚Äôs watching me. I can‚Äôt even look at the cameras, it‚Äôs too much right now. I‚Äôm just so goddamn scared.

August 3rd: 
	I got a few days off after‚Ä¶ the incident. Anna told me I‚Äôd get paid for them, but I wouldn‚Äôt care either way. So far there no one knows who killed that deer, or broke the trail cam. 

	I talked to Tom outside of work. It turns out we‚Äôve been going to the same laundromat for years, knew I recognized him from somewhere. He‚Äôs doing well, just proposed to his boyfriend of 6 years, Shaun. Good for him. 

	He did bring up something I hadn‚Äôt thought of while we spoke: The Rake probably got its name from its hands. Somehow I didn‚Äôt put that together, that it‚Äôs called The Rake because its hands are wide, and it has long fingers. Like a rake, for leaves and shit. For some reason I thought it was just a random name that sounded kinda spooky, but no it was named after the yard tool. Maybe I‚Äôm just stupid, I don‚Äôt know. 

	I‚Äôve been sleeping closer to night now. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ uncomfortable. 7 years of day sleeping does that to you I guess. I‚Äôve had little to no paralysis, and it usually only lasts a minute or two. Maybe I should follow up with the doctor about this.

	The Rake is always in the back of my mind, just popping back up every now and then to steal me from normal thinking. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ so bizarre. Maybe, I should try and ignore it for a bit, it can‚Äôt be good for my brain. I‚Äôve only got a few more days off left, so I gotta start preparing to go back. Hopefully by then I‚Äôll be able to stop envisioning the damn thing in the cameras. 

Hopefully. Talk to you next time. 
	
August 8th: 
	I have never been as scared as last night. I swear, to whatever god looks down on us, I swear on your grave, that this happened. 

	I was asleep at night again, somehow. There were no pills, I was just tired for the first time in forever. I woke up again, paralyzed. I just sat calmly this time, waiting for it to finish. But I looked over at my window, and I saw it open. It wasn‚Äôt open when I looked, it had just finished opening when I turned my eyes.

	It was then, when I felt pressure on my bed. Like it was being climbed on. And when I looked at the foot, it was right fucking there. The Rake.

	I swear it was there, I saw and felt its weight on my mattress. Its skin was gray and stretched over its frame. I could see its spine from just looking at its back. It turned its head. It looked like a bleached skull, its teeth clearly visible along the sides of its head. It had no nose, just a triangular hole in the middle of its face. Its eyes were sunken, deep pits. The light from the window barely illuminated it. It looked at me, I could just barely see the white pinpoint reflections of its eye. Its neck cracked, I could hear its bones creaking as it climbed onto me. It pressed all its weight on me, lurching its head down to stare at me. It breathed sharply through its teeth, only its teeth. It just stared at me, right into my eyes, never blinking. 

	It stared into me. I could feel its giant hands on my shoulders, pinning me down. I swear I almost felt a drop of its saliva on my face as it just loomed over my frozen body. It spoke. Not out loud, but its voice rang in my head. There were many voices, speaking in tandem. It was young, it was old. It was a man, a woman, something in between, something beyond, all at once. But they all said the same thing.

	‚ÄúDon't be afraid.‚Äù

	It tilted its head to the side. I swear its eyes got brighter. 

	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôve always been here.‚Äù

	Its voice rang in my mind like an echo, as I felt myself crying. There was a comfort to its voice, a dreadful comfort that brought tears to my eyes. My mind was just screaming, trying to move any part of my body or talk or anything. I could only squeeze my eyes shut, begging whoever was listening out there to make it stop.  I don‚Äôt know how long I was lying there, but after a moment, I opened my eyes, and it was gone. 

	I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt feel safe in my own goddamn apartment. Who do I even talk to about this? Where can I even go? This shit is actually insane. I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do. Who would? This is‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.

	I have to go back to the tower.

August 23rd: 
So, a lot of things have changed. I haven‚Äôt written in this for awhile, and this might be the last time. 

	First off, I went back to the watchtower. I was driving up when I heard police sirens, and when I got there, there were about 5 cars. I ran over to what happened, but only caught a glimpse of an older bearded man being thrown in the back of one of the cars. An officer asked me to back away from the cars, and I wasn‚Äôt looking to be arrested.

	I looked over at the cabin tower, and saw Tom with another cop being interviewed. They never asked me anything, at least not that day. I went over to Tom when all the police left, and before he left I asked what had happened. 

	Apparently the old night watcher, George Fredrick‚Äôs, had been sneaking into the cabin tower for months. He was leaving various images, and even making random noises at night. He had been doing this to scare away the new workers, real Scooby Doo shit. He was never spotted because he knew exactly where the trail cameras were. Learned later on he was also the one who had skinned the deer in Broksman, and he was addicted to a lotta illegal bath salts and stuff.

	After the investigation, I tried getting back to night shifting, but found myself almost collapsing in exhaustion during my shifts. Somehow, my sleeping had actually gone back to normal. I don‚Äôt know if it was the journal or not. Maybe it was‚Ä¶ nah. 

	I ended up giving Anna my two weeks notice, she seemed to understand. I‚Äôm gonna stop writing in this journal after a while, if not right after this. It was‚Ä¶nice. It was like getting to talk to her again. She was always such a good listener. 

	I miss you, Jen. 

	Now, I checked with my doctors, they said that seeing‚Ä¶ you know what, was just a really bad case of sleep paralysis. My imagination and obsession had manifested in my dreams, and when you have sleep paralysis you often dream with your eyes open. So it was really no wonder I saw that damn thing. 

	I‚Äôm moving out of the Bluewood area tonight, just finished up my last night shift, hopefully ever. I asked Tom if he‚Äôd be willing to talk outside of work, to keep me sane (didn‚Äôt say that part). We‚Äôve been chatting on and off for a week now, he and his fiance even met up for lunch one day. They‚Äôre good people. 

You‚Äôd think after all this I wouldn‚Äôt believe in any kind of monster thing living in the woods. After all, it was just the insane former night watcher and my overactive imagination. But a part of me still isn‚Äôt sure. Anna said people had been seeing it for years, long before George was working or even born. The myth is as old as the cave, as the Bluewood area. It‚Äôs always been something people talk about, something people claim to see. I‚Äôm one of many. Maybe it was real. Maybe it was just what I needed to finally sleep. 

	And when I went to pack last night, my window was wide open.",1,1760815815.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Welcome to Camp Arthur



As the crisp autumn morning surrendered to the imposing structure of Pursley Oaks Asylum, Detective Jameson and writer Elijah stepped out of their vehicle, the rustling of leaves beneath their feet a stark contrast to the eerie silence that enveloped the building. The wind whipped through the trees, creating miniature tornadoes that danced across the parking lot, leaves swirling in a kaleidoscope of colors.

The two men approached the entrance, the huge gray doors looming before them like a colorblind man's perspective of heaven's gate. Pushing open the double doors, a burst of wind swept in, carrying with it a flurry of leaves that scattered across the pristine white floors. The interior was a symphony of white: white lights, white walls, white ceilings, and white-clad nurses who moved with precision, their faces frozen in polite smiles. The atmosphere was a nightmare pretending to be heaven.

As Jameson and Elijah approached the front desk, a stern-looking head nurse greeted them. ""Can I help you gentlemen?"" she asked, her voice firm but polite. Jameson flashed his badge, while Elijah introduced himself as a writer.

""We're here to see a patient,"" Jameson said, his voice low and professional. ""Jackeem Robertson, room 1227A.""

The head nurse's expression remained neutral, but a flicker of curiosity danced in her eyes. ""Very well. That'll be $100, please."" The men exchanged a glance before handing over two crisp $50 bills. The nurse's hands moved with precision as she accepted the payment, her eyes never leaving theirs.

As they followed her down the long corridors, the sound of their footsteps echoed off the walls. Room numbers and names blurred together, but Elijah's writer's instincts kicked in, and he began to jot down notes in his mind, already envisioning the story that could unfold. The corridors seemed to stretch on forever, the white walls and floors blending together in a disorienting haze.

Finally, they reached room 1227A, where the name ""Jackeem Robertson"" was printed in bold black letters. The head nurse pushed open the door, revealing a room that was a continuation of the white theme: white walls, white bedding, and white bandages wrapped around Jack's eyes, despite his perfectly healthy gaze. Jack himself was the only splash of color in this sterile environment, his presence a stark contrast to the sea of white.

They suspected that if it wasn't for the wealthy benefactor keeping Jack here, he would have been swept up and thrown out like the leaves that littered the parking lot. Jameson and Elijah exchanged a glance, before grabbing their seats.

""Mr. Robertson,"" the head nurse said, her voice softer now, ""you have visitors."" Jack's gaze shifted toward them, his eyes hidden behind the bandages. ""Who are they?"" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

""We're here to discuss the events of 1989,"" Jameson said, his voice firm but gentle. ""The case has been closed for years, but we've been asked to...re-examine the facts."" Jack's nod was almost imperceptible, but it was enough. The men sat down, notepads at the ready. Elijah's pen hovered over his paper, poised to capture every detail, while Jameson's eyes narrowed, focused on extracting the truth.

As Jack began to speak, his voice was barely above a whisper, but it was enough to command attention. ""It started with the camp my friend's uncle had bought...and the town we had visited. The things I saw...the things I did..."" The men's eyes met, a spark igniting between them. A story needed to be told, and a case needed to be closed. They knew they were about to uncover something dark, something that would challenge everything they thought they knew about the huge town being built miles away. The reason they were both sent here five years after the fact.

""Go on,"" Elijah said, his voice low and 
encouraging.

As Jack's words began to flow, a peculiar phenomenon seemed to occur. The light in the room appeared to fade, as if the very presence of his voice was draining the atmosphere of its warmth and vitality. The temperature dropped, and the air grew colder, heavy with an unseen presence. Elijah's and Jameson's vision swirled, their focus narrowing to a single point: Jack's face.

The sound of Jack's voice became a low, hypnotic hum, drawing them in the men like a slow-moving tide. They felt themselves being pulled into the darkness, their minds reeling with the implications of what Jack was saying.

The room seemed to shrink, the walls closing in on them like a vise. The white walls, once so pristine and clean, now seemed to glow with an eerie, otherworldly light. The bandages around Jack's eyes seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy, as if they were restraining a monster.

""...The things I saw...the things I did..."" Jack's voice trailed off, and for a moment, there was silence. The only sound was the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, and the men's own ragged breathing.

Jack's point of view.

The maroon Chevrolet G20 van rumbled down the winding back country roads, its tires screeching as Justin navigated the curves with a confident ease. Amanda rode shotgun, her long blonde hair blowing in the wind as she gazed out at the passing scenery. A Cabbage Patch Kid dangled from the rearview mirror, its plastic eyes gleaming with a cheerful intensity that seemed almost mocking in the dim light of the van.

I sat next to Amy, an ex-nerdy Asian girl turned free spirit. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her bright brown eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief. She was the love of my life, but she'd made it clear she wasn't interested ‚Äì at least, not yet. Behind us, Chris, a 6'7"" giant stoner, sat quietly, his shaggy brown hair falling across his forehead. He was my best friend, always ready with a joke or a smile, and he spoke as quietly as a church mouse, as if he didn't want to disturb the peace.

The van's decor was a mishmash of hippie chic and desperation ‚Äì blue cloth covering the seats, a faded peace sign on the dashboard. We were a group of misfits, trying to keep the dying embers of the hippie movement alive. The reason we were headed to Ashwood was because of Amanda's uncle. He'd recently bought an old abandoned camp, Camp blue lily now changed to camp Arthur, named after the founder of the town. The camp had a dark history ‚Äì 30 kids had gone missing since its opening and closing in the 1920-1930 and again in 1940-1945. Some at the camp itself, others right after they got home. It was rumored to be the work of Michael Stephens, a serial killer caught in 1945 after being shot in a camp a few states away.

As we drove, I spoke up, ""So, is your uncle going to change the name of the camp?"" Amanda turned around, her bright blue eyes sparkling with amusement. ""Yeah, with the money he has and the team he has behind them, I'm pretty sure he's going to change it. Any suggestions?"" she asked the group.

Amy spoke up, her voice soft and melodious. ""Well, Crystal Lake is taken.""

Chris whispered from the back, his voice barely audible. ""You can't call it Sleepaway Camp.""

I chimed in, ""I just hope it won't be a long weekend.

Amanda laughed deep cut she said.

Justin finally spoke up, his voice smooth as honey. ""We should call it Camp Amanda,"" he said, as he kissed her hand. The group oohed and ahhed, but I felt a pang of jealousy. Amy's eyes flicked to the window, her expression unreadable.

As we drove through the small towns, I noticed something strange. Each town was tiny, with barely enough houses, and the streets were deserted except for stray dogs wandering around. And every single house and gas station had yellow and blue flowers in front of it. I took pictures from the speeding vehicle, my mind whirling with boredom.

The tank in the van read empty as we pulled into the third town, Maplewood. Much bigger than the last two, it seemed like a bustling metropolis compared to the tiny villages we'd passed through. We made it to a gas station just in time, and as we all got out to stretch our legs, the attendants in and out of the store eyed us with suspicion, their faces a mixture of curiosity and hostility.


Amanda took Amy's hand and led her inside the gas station to the clerk. ""Fill 'er up,"" she said with a smile, her eyes sparkling with curiosity as she began to ask questions. Meanwhile, outside the van, the attendant was filling up the gas tank. I picked up my camera and took a picture of the attendant, who looked annoyed and stared at me deeply, making me uncomfortable. I walked away to take pictures of other surroundings, leaving Justin and Chris to talk.

""Chris, it's time for you to lose your V-card, man,"" Justin said, punching Chris in the arm. ""We agreed to be camp counselors for the upcoming summer, and I think that'll be your chance."" Chris's eyebrows raised in surprise. ""You mean the other counselors?"" he asked jokingly. ""And like, not with the..."" Justin cut him off, his face darkening. Saying. ""Dude, what the fuck?"" Chris retorted, laughing. ""Like, I thought since Amanda is one year younger than you, you had a thing for..."" Justin raised his fist, ready to become the old Justin he used to be before Amanda came back into his life and before the money came back.

I moved on to where the girls were. 

Inside the gas station, Amanda was chatting with the old clerk while Amy grabbed all the cola, chips, and beer she could find. The old clerk eyed Amy warily until Amanda chimed in. ""So, is it busy?"" Amanda asked. ""Huh? The clerk questioned. The store, like, do a lot of people travel through the town?"" Amanda explained. The old clerk's expression turned guarded. ""What for?"" he asked gruffly. Amanda explained, ""Well, because we're on the way to the old camp near Ashwood. Since my uncle's reopening it, and more traffic might come through, we want to make business with the locals."" The old clerk's face turned red with anger. ""No business needed from Ashwood,"" he said. ""No business whatsoever from the likes of people traveling to Ashwood."" Amanda smiled sweetly. ""Well, I hope to change that.""

As they prepared to leave, Amanda turned to the old clerk and said, ""Who knows, your kids will probably love the camp."" The old clerk looked back at her coldly and said, ""Ain't no kids left to go to no camp."" As the crew began to pack up the fully filled van, I kept taking pictures. I snapped a photo of a pole with missing person posters on it, as one page fell off. So I picked it up, revealing a picture of a little girl. looking up and seeing graffiti on the wall behind the pole that read, ""All missing are with the lilies.""I  took a picture and later hopped into the van.

I gave the missing poster to Amy, who took it and pinned it up on her seat in front of her. Amy liked collecting weird photographs and pictures, and this one of a beautiful little girl missing for seven years fit right in among her collection. As they left the town, I noticed signs on the doors of shops that read, ""No one is welcomed.""  Seeing yellow and blue flowers on the doors and windows of the town match the weirdness. As we drove away, I noticed the town's people may be indoors but a lot of woodland creatures and animals were walking the square. We continued driving on to Ashwood.

The journey unfolded as a serene, forty-five-minute odyssey through the rolling hills and verdant forests of the countryside, the van's wheels humming in gentle synchrony with the rhythm of the landscape. The late afternoon sun cast a warm, golden glow over the scene, illuminating the vibrant hues of the fall foliage and imbuing the air with a sense of rustic tranquility. As we drove, the woods seemed to come alive, deer bounding effortlessly through the underbrush, their delicate forms a testament to the untamed beauty of nature.

The atmosphere was peaceful, the only sound was the soft purr of the engine and the occasional chirp of a bird, when suddenly, the idyllic landscape began to transform.

A thick, heavy fog rolled in, shrouding the van in an impenetrable veil of mist, reducing visibility to mere feet. Justin's voice, laced with a hint of frustration, broke the silence, ""Damn, who pissed off God? I can't see shit here."" Amanda's response was calm, measured, ""Just go slow and straight, please."" Her words were met with a sidelong glance from Justin, his expression a mixture of annoyance and dismissal, as if to say, ""Bitch, I know how to drive.""

In that instant, his attention wavered, and the van's occupants were thrown into a heart-stopping moment of terror as Justin swerved to avoid a deer standing eerily in the middle of the road. The vehicle's occupants were thrown to the left, their bodies pressed against the door as they peered out the window, catching glimpses of shadowy forms lurking in the fog-shrouded darkness.

The van careened, its tires screeching in protest, before Justin wrestled it back under control, the fog finally beginning to dissipate, revealing a breathtaking vista of sun-drenched hills and verdant forests. As they emerged from the mist, a vibrant, hand-painted sign came into view, adorned with smiling suns and a serene river scene, bearing the welcoming message, ""Ashwood, All Are Welcome.‚Äù

As we pulled into the town, I exclaimed, ""We're here!!"" and hastily grabbed my camera to capture the sprawling landscape. The town was a marvel, boasting imposing buildings and paved streets that seemed to pulse with life. The sidewalks were bustling with people from all walks of life, a vibrant tapestry of diversity that stood in stark contrast to the quieter towns we had visited earlier. Chris, whispering from the backseat, quipped, ""This place must have had slaves in the past with the amount of black people walking around in the middle of nowhere."" The group chuckled, and I snapped multiple photos as we rolled into what appeared to be the town's gas station, connected to a small diner.

Once we parked, we immediately stepped out to stretch our legs. As our feet touched the ground, the gas station clerk approached us with a happy smile on her face, gleaming with warmth. ""Can I help you?"" she asked. We spoke with her as a group to gather directions to the camp and were told it would be best to go inside the diner and get some food and directions.

As we entered the diner, I took a picture of the people laughing and enjoying their food. The camera snapped, and the people all looked at me in a split second, then went back to their meals. Everyone posing at the same time was weird, but I was immediately distracted from the event when the waitress brought us to our table. She took our coffee order and brought it back to the table in a jiffy. She asked where we were from; I guess it was obvious that we weren't from around here. Small towns are super tight-knit, I guess.

Amanda explained that her uncle had bought the camp a few miles up the mountain and was here to study the surrounding town and make sure the camp was up and ready for the next season. A man named Billy, who immediately made it clear he was the town's drunk, said, ""You're Mr. Lee's kids?"" Amanda nodded. ""Well, your dinner is on us,"" he said, pointing to everyone around. Amy looked shocked. Being the food lover of the group, she began to order more than her stomach could carry. We were all tired of eating junk food and drinking beer and cola the whole drive here.

""You sure?"" I asked. ""Yeah, why not?"" Billy slurred. ""Your uncle did just buy 70% of the town."" ""What!?"" the group said in unison. As we looked at Amanda, trying to get an understanding, Justin asked first, ""Did you know about this, baby?"" Amanda replied, ""Um, no, my uncle didn't tell me. I know he's rich, but he's the type to buy a hotel and put his name in diamonds on it, not buy a camp far away, let alone buy a town in the middle of nowhere.""

Billy said, with a burp, ""Well, this town in the middle of nowhere has much more history than you think, child. We're the family of Arthur, and this is the town of Ashwood."" He began telling the town's history while drinking his Irish coffee and stumbling from table to table. No one seemed to be annoyed; all were handing him things from their tables to help him illustrate past events.

Apparently, the town was named after Arthur Ashwood, an intelligent settler who carried more books and scrolls than he did food and water. He saw the land and the white-bark trees in the forest as a sign to stay here. Billy spoke, ""Yeah, he shook hands with everyone and everybody. It didn't matter if you were white, black, red, or yellow,"" as he pointed to our table. ""Did you know he spoke several languages? He even knew how to read Egyptian hieroglyphs and Latin. Hell, even some of our elders understand it a little."" His motto and creed were simply, ""All men should know more,"" he said, still drinking.

He beamed about the town's library and hospital, like it was his job to know all. He started to talk about a couple of the town's cheating scandals before the people in the diner cut him off. Great timing, as the waitress, named Betty, brought our food to the table. It's y'all fault for getting him going, you know he can't shut up once he starts, Betty said laughing. We immediately dug in, and from the first bite, we had to stop and look at each other. ""Fuck, it was good,"" Chris mentioned. He should have smoked before eating this so he could feel the Nirvana of deliciousness. ""Yeah, y'all enjoying that?"" Billy laughed. ""That's the same reason your uncle bought the town.""

Amanda, after taking a few bites, spoke up, ""Do you know how he even found out about the town? I mean, I only know what I know from the news articles back in the day."" Billy, trying to avoid the news articles, replied, ""Well, he told us he won the camp in a gamble against one of our old members. When he just wanted to get rid of it himself, he was convinced to come down here and check it out. He fell in love with the food, people, and liquor. Right then and there, he called up some of his buddies, and they all decided to come down and try. So now we have more stores and homes being built all over. Hell, we have a pizza place and a Spanish restaurant now. All thanks to Mr. Thomas.""

""Who?"" asked Amanda. ""No one important,"" said the waitress Betty, as she gave us pieces of pie we didn't order, matched with herbal tea. ""It's the town's favorite,"" she exclaimed, wanting us to try it. Just like the first bite of the entree, the dessert was heavenly.

Amy‚Äôs point of view. 

After a few bites and a sip of tea, I felt the urge to throw up. I ran out of the diner with Jack running behind me. I barely made it to the street before hurling vomit out of my throat. Jack appeared next to me; I knew he still liked me, and I liked him, but I wasn't ready to talk to him about it. ""Are you ok?"" Jack asked. ""Yeah, I guess the baby didn't like the dessert,"" I replied, immediately regretting the words as they left my mouth.

Jack's eyes grew huge as he processed the information. He began to stumble, trying to figure out who the father was. It would be insulting if I didn't know who I was. We both knew I had had many men in my life, but he didn't know he was the only guy I had been with all year long. Being four months pregnant, it was obvious to me that he was the father. I wasn't ready to tell him yet. I knew he would want to know, but I was torn; he could make something out of himself without me. I should make a decision before I have my own little dolomite in a few months.

""The father isn't important,"" I said out loud. ""Just hand me a water bottle out of the van so I can wash my mouth out."" He grabbed the water, still looking shocked. I rinsed my mouth out and took a few sips. ""Just don't tell the others, please,"" I finally spoke. He smiled weakly, replying, ""It's ok, I'm just more worried about how I am going to take swimsuit photos of you by the lake in camp."" The joke felt good. ""Just use your instincts,"" I chuckled back.

The bell rang as the rest of the crew exited the diner. Apparently, it had gotten too late, and the townsfolk were letting us stay in the bed and breakfast down the road. As soon as they said that, it seemed we all yawned in unison. We made it to the inn, where we were astonished by the decor of the place. The wood finish and carpentry had to be done by experts from the heavens. A huge fireplace in the common area had a painting of what I could assume to be Arthur Ashwood and his wife, her face veiled in black, her eyes hidden from view.

We made it to our rooms upstairs. Chris went into his and hopped onto his bed, pulling out a porno mag from his back pocket. As his legs hung off the bed, Jack closed his door for him, being a true friend to the idiot Chris. Then Jack went into his room; he asked if I could join him to talk, but before I could answer, Justin pushed his head into the room, saying, ""No one is getting pussy but me tonight."" As he picked up Amanda, who walked through the door, and threw her on the bed in his room, closing the door after.

I went into mine and closed the door. As soon as I laid down in my bed, my eyes closed, and I slept instantly. I woke up suddenly, but my eyes couldn't fully open. I was in the pitch black, with only what seemed like light from a fire outside shining through the window shutter cracks. I heard footsteps coming down the hall, going room to room, as I heard whispering. I closed my eyes again, falling asleep. Another sound grabbed my attention; I heard the steps go into another room. Someone was talking; was that Jack trying to find out which room was mine? God, he needed to let me...

As I fell asleep and woke up one last time, I felt pure fear. Shadows were in my room, three shadows surrounding me as I lay in bed. As I heard them talking, I couldn't understand the language. One crept closer to my face, and seeing my eyes move slightly, I was paralyzed, unable to move or speak. The shadow figure turned to the others, and the one on my right grabbed something and poked my arm. I freaked out slightly as the sound outside grabbed everyone's attention. An old lady screamed outside, ""I'm not crazy!!!!""

Just then, the fire outside grew just bright enough to see the lower half of the faces of the figures. The realization that shadows shouldn't have faces made me choke. They left quickly as my eyes closed. I couldn't hear whether the doors were closed or not. I fell into a deep sleep. Immediately, I was in the middle of a forest in front of a pond, naked with my pregnant belly full, ready to burst at any moment. I turned my head to see other women standing naked around the pond, except all were old and covered in blood. They turned to look at me as my legs started to run away. They ran after me; their saggy skin flapped as their blood covered the path they took to me. ""Stop!!!"" they yelled as I sprinted for dear life. I couldn't outrun them; my legs and belly were too heavy. I needed to get rid of this baby, I thought.

I ran until I saw a deer in front of me pointing his antlers towards a tree to hide in. I quickly crouched into the tree with sticks pricking into my back. I hid as the women shouted ""stop"" as they ran past my hiding spot. I felt relieved for two seconds until I saw the same deer standing in front of me. Damnit, he was going to warn the others where I was. Then I felt small hands touch me in the tree. They kept pulling me, asking me to stay hidden with them. As I pulled out of their grasp, I ran away in a different direction until I saw a little girl, the same little girl from the missing poster Jack gave me earlier today.

She stood in front of the same pond I first ran from; she was crying, her head down. I approached her to comfort her and have her be quiet so the ladies wouldn't hear. I got close to her as she spoke, ""I lost my mommy. It's cold outside. Can you let me in?"" she said, oddly. ""Huh?"" I replied. As I heard screams from behind me, the women returned. ""Don't do it. Come here,"" they shouted. ""Can you let me in?"" the little girl asked again.

As I turned to look at her, she raised her head. Pure black eyes, pale skin, and a smile on her face. ""Let me in!!!"" she screamed. As she placed hands on my head, I fell to my knees as something behind her rose from the pond, turning the blue water murky. Crawling out towards me, as all the old women behind me caught me, grabbing my arms and hair, pulling me apart. As the little girl smiled, rubbing my stomach, the monster crawled with its big head, reaching my stomach and pulling out my baby draped in shadowy skin from my stomach. As blue liquid came out from the mouths of all attending my massacre.

I gripped the sheets hard enough to rip a hole in them, choking out more vomit, sweating, and, oh no, I pissed myself. When my head was snatched off my gushing body, I finally stopped dreaming as my body relaxed the last hours of sleep.

I'm a 38M daydreamer / overthinker in remission. I'd love to find someone who wants to build connections around some unholy mix of deep compassion, flirty fun, exploration both mental and physical, and just sharing a coffee together. A simple coffee though; my love of adjectives doesn't translate well to coffee orders.

I am fully in-love with my life, married and poly (dating separately) with a family I'm grateful to call mine. I'd love to meet someone who's secure in their situations and looking for more growth. I'm demisexual & pan and very kink-engaged, though generally more attracted to feminine energy. 

I don't expect to find anyone local as I live fairly rural, but I'd love for an opportunity to take a walk together. Closest major metro area to me is Pittsburgh, but it's still a bit of a drive. Drives can be fun though; builds the anticipation.

I've recently found that scribbling poetry is more cathartic to me than journaling. I've found that my favorite songs sound better when belting them out, even if it pushes me into falsetto. I've found that seeing my latest mile time come across my watch is better than remembering I'm not as fast as I used to be. I've found that being a walking human contradiction is much more fun than trying to be anything you're not. 

So you be you, and I'll be me, and we'll see where that takes us. Let's share the laughs, the sobs, the funny jabs, and all the random thoughts that we can't even fully articulate. Good things take time, so let's grow together.",1,1760815684.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

I am exhausted!","I apologize to Reddit because I mostly use it to bring my concerns, questions and disappointments about dating and being attracted to straight men, because not many other areas of my life bring such despair and confusion. So, here we go on another tale. Please stop by and help me.  

I am a 26F who's been talking to a 28M I met on a trip I took to another state in late August. He‚Äôs friends with the friend I stayed with during my trip. He‚Äôs super nice, very stylish, good looking, extremely kind, we have lots in common and he is genuinely a sweet dude. We‚Äôve been talking everyday for 1.5 months, and I think it‚Äôs safe to say that our age you don‚Äôt hold an everyday chat with a person of the sex you are attracted to unless it‚Äôs your best friend or you‚Äôre related to them. I am neither‚Ä¶ so, why is he talking to me?

He gives glimpses of interest, for example, three weeks ago my parents traveled to his city because I loved it and they decided to go there as well, they‚Äôre empty nesters now and focusing on themselves. While they were there he was constantly checking in on them, asking if they needed anything and since my dad is a coffee lover and this guy has a really cool coffee shop my parents went to the coffee shop, and loved it. In our chat I mentioned I loved matcha more than coffee, so, the day after my parents went to his coffee shop (they didn‚Äôt meet, I just mentioned to my parents one of the owners was a friend), he texted me telling me he wanted to sent me some Organic Japanese Matcha, and went to my parents hotel to drop it off so they could bring it to me. Did that melt my heart? Yes. Did it make me think he likes me? Yes. 

It was so unexpected, but via text he takes HOURS to reply, while simultaneously sharing more and more of his life, sends pics of where he is and what he is doing and we‚Äôve developed hilarious banter. He shared with me that his sister is pregnant and he is super excited about being an uncle, having two perfect baby niece and nephew myself, I share the joy. He‚Äôs shared his dad‚Äôs health struggles with me, and he‚Äôs also mindful of my life and my issues. But when it comes to sharing the more serious stuff in life‚Ä¶ I would say he took the initiative. He‚Äôs considerate, attentive, listens well and seems genuinely interested. 

But that‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ when he texts he is so kind, but then disappears for literally half a day at times. When he comes back he says he didn‚Äôt want to rush a reply and wanted to wait till he could reply properly. But that‚Äôs could take 14 hours. He is slowly starting to text back more frequently. He‚Äôs hinted at wanting to visit my city, and I told him he was more than welcome to do so. 

But I don‚Äôt know what I am dealing with. A man who is not interested and is only a genuinely kind person, or what? This is terrifying, he is warm and attentive to me‚Ä¶ but he is not all over me. What is this? ",10,1760815368.0,dating_advice,24,0.78,False

We work in the same company a mostly male workforce. I work in a different department than her but it crosses over. We have recently started talking alot about things at home private stuff that wouldn't be a conversation for work. We buy take away coffees for each other also she calls and asks if im around the area if you want to grab food etc. I have gave small hints that I like her just in case she doesn't reciprocate it doesn't ruin our friendship. 

She calls everyday to see how im getting on and tells me about hers but here's the thing im not sure if shes just being nice or into me. 

Also I work in engineering so the other possibility is she could be lesbian and I definitely dont want to make it awkward between us.

Her cholesterol is up, it's not bad but it's borderline. She's on hypertension meds but the doctor suggested she make some lifestyle changes but she's not willing. 

I've tried several times and even built specific diets for her but she won't follow them she's always like ""humare time mei hum jaisa khana khate the Mai waisa hi khaungi"" 

She'll just go back to eating some poha or upma for breakfast and then roti subzi daal chawal for lunch and something similar for dinner and doesn't even realise that just because she's not eating fried foods everyday that it's all ""healthy"". 

She'll drink tea and coffee (in small cups) 4-5 times a day. Doesn't abstain from sugar in it. 

She used to walk 8-10k steps a until few years ago but now she just does maybe 3-5k two or three times a week. And she's always like I have knee pain and once she's better she'll be like if I walk I'll get knee pain again. 

I'll say one thing her sleep is fine, she wakes up at the same time and goes to sleep at the same time everyday but other than that she's not trying to be healthy. 

I've made her try intermittent fasting, regular deficit diets, even woke up to workout with her a few weeks. She stops as soon as I stop monitoring her. 


How do I convince her to follow a strict routine?

We‚Äôre looking for nice neighborhoods that are pleasant to explore in the morning and have great cafes where we can grab coffee or breakfast, maybe even get a bit of work done. Bonus points if the area is walkable or has good local food options nearby ‚Äî we‚Äôd prefer not to rely on a car too much.

If you have any recommendations for neighborhoods, cafes, or morning activities that fit this schedule, we‚Äôd really appreciate it!

One idea I‚Äôm considering is offering a simple pre-order option, where customers can place and pay for their drink ahead of time, then just pick it up when they arrive. I‚Äôm also wondering if a shared loyalty program across several local caf√©s could help keep regulars coming back.

I‚Äôm curious how other shop owners see this:

* Have you tried mobile pre-orders, and did it actually speed things up or create new problems?
* Did customers adopt it, or did most still prefer to order in person?
* If you run a loyalty program, what format works best ‚Äî app, QR code, card, or something else?
* And did you integrate any of this with your POS, or keep it separate?

1oa4jvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oa4jvg/my_wife_doesnt_consider_me/,My wife doesn't consider me,"My (33F) wife (37F) and I have been together for almost 10 years, married for 8. Things have been rough and getting worse since Covid. I though we were going to split up back in 2021, but we were actively trying to get pregnant and we did. I carried and gave birth to our kid who is genetically mine. Things got better for a bit, then when our sex life never recovered we had a few hard conversations- fights really- where she admitted that she wasn't attracted to me anymore and when I asked if she wanted to be with me, she answered ""well I am, so it doesn't matter"" 
She swears up and down that she loves me...

We're both non confrontational people and have developed a problematic habit of avoiding the problems and just going along. And so we had a second kid. I carried an embryo made with her egg, so baby #2 is genetically hers.

I know we probably shouldn't have had either kid, but they're both amazing and I can't imagine going through life without them.

Here's what's been bothering me lately: during my maternity leave, I was probably more active around the house than I should have been. Then I also dislocated my arm and ny sister came to help out, but I was still doing chores and such around the house to the point my sister was berating me for not resting and letting myself heal. But my wife didn't see that and thought I spent my leave doing nothing. Now she's on leave and she actually is doing nothing. I come home from work and have to clean up the kitchen, cook dinner, do the laundry, and other various tasks. 

The part that gets me the most is that she doesn't think about me. If I make myself coffee, I make some for her as well. If I need water, I get some for her too. If I want dessert, I get it for both of us, and the list goes on. Just yesterday, she got herself and our oldest something to drink and didn't even ask if I wanted some. Then today, I had to come into work. While I was getting ready (after making breakfast for everyone and brewing a pot of coffee) she's got the older kid propped in front of the TV and the baby is content playing, and she's sitting on the couch on her phone. She couldn't even be bothered to think to pour some coffee for me. She knows how I like it..

So of course I make both our coffees before leaving.

Am I crazy for thinking she should think about me? I don't know that divorce is in the cards. I do love her and I love many aspects of our life together, but I'm scared of what life would look like if we did split up. Her family is my family, her friends are my friends. All of my friends have moved out of state and she always guilt trips me for doing anything social without her.",3,1760814914.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

So we live on the south coast, in Brighton. I live with my partner, but my mum lives nearby and has been feeling a bit lonely lately. She works shifts and is also doing a college course on her days off, so her schedule is all over the place. She‚Äôs in her early 50s, not old at all, just busy and tired most of the time.

She mentioned today that someone from her college (a bit older) was using some kind of app to meet people for chatting, having coffee, or just practising English. My mum liked the idea but doesn‚Äôt know what app that was.

Just to clarify, she‚Äôs married and not looking for anything romantic. They‚Äôre doing long distance at the moment and she travels home when she can, but she just wants to make some new friends locally.

My partner and I try and drive somewhere nice for us all to have a good day trip, we go grocery shopping or just invite her for dinner but the thing is, we both work office hours and our weekends off rarely match her schedule, so she ends up spending most of her free time alone. She is already studying and working so picking up a new hobby etc in order to 'maybe meet new friends there"" is not an option.She‚Äôd love to have some friends to talk to or meet up with on her days off.

I‚Äôve only ever used dating apps myself so I have no clue what‚Äôs actually safe or good for meeting people platonically. I‚Äôve heard of some things, but I‚Äôm not sure if they actually work.

Ideally, she‚Äôd like to meet other people (not in their 20s like us haha!), improve her English (it is not bad but it is just not her first language) or just open to chatting over coffee and walks.

If anyone has any experience or suggestions for apps or local groups where people genuinely just want to make friends - please let me know I really don‚Äôt want her to feel lonely but I also want to recommend something as safe as it can be in this context.",6,1760814876.0,brighton,5,0.88,False

‚ÄúI love you too, I‚Äôll see you tonight.‚Äù



I stepped out the door at 6:34 this morning, waving to my wife from the sidewalk as she headed back inside, presumably to grab another cup of tea and get our daughter, Olivia, fed and ready for daycare before she left for the train. ¬†



We moved to Brookhaven, Illinois, 20 miles outside of Chicago, from Southern California five years ago.¬† We were ready to start a family and we just couldn‚Äôt get on firm ground in SoCal, so when my wife got a job offer in the Chicago, we jumped at the chance.¬† My in-laws have settled into their golden years here in Brookhaven, so we bought a place five minutes from em, popped out a kid, and haven‚Äôt looked back.¬†



I‚Äôm luckier than most.¬† While I can‚Äôt work from home, I can walk to work, door to door, in twenty minutes flat.¬† I struggled my first two winters here, but walking year round has thickened up my California blood, those dorks are right, there isn‚Äôt bad weather, just bad clothing! I start the day with some fresh air and exercise, and the quiet calm gives me time to decompress after a long day at the station.¬† I‚Äôve made it a point to leave my phone alone in my bag, and my headphones out of my ears.¬† For forty minutes a day, I‚Äôm afforded the opportunity to disconnect, to feel the air and sun on my face, to hear the birds chirp and squirrels fight, to simply exist where I am.¬†



I began walking south, it was a brisk September day, one that requires a jacket for the morning walk, and room in my bag for said jacket on the walk home.¬† My neighbor Scott, from two houses down, was loading up his work van as I walked by.¬† 4 inch PVC pipe, bonding, fittings, and a shovel.¬† I‚Äôm guessing drainage project.¬†



‚ÄúMorning Scott, what‚Äôs todays gig?‚Äù



‚ÄúSump pump discharge.‚Äù He replied.¬† Nailed it!



‚ÄúThere are worse days for it, have a good one!‚Äù



‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù



I continued walking, passing the dozen or so houses on my street before rounding the corner and heading east, on Jefferson Avenue.¬† The north side of Jefferson continued the sprawl of single family homes, but the south side‚Äôs residences were cut short by a small, naturalized prairie.¬† Indiangrass and big bluestem dominated the landscape.¬† Drifts of purple gentians, yellow goldenrod and orange prairie dock gave color to the otherwise muted hues of the prairie grass.¬† Ahead, Jefferson Ave continued east over the river.¬† Just before the bridge, a pedestrian crossing split the road.¬† I crossed the road and followed the limestone path, heading south.¬† To my left, the river meandered lazily, it‚Äôs shoreline crowded with tall grass and sedges, lobelia and swamp milkweed.¬† Occasional clearings reached the river for benches and water access.¬† River birches and black walnut trees hung over the water, the rockbed occasionally breaking the surface, creating turbulence in the current. ¬†



As I continued down the path, the prairie on my right gave way to mature, dominating oaks, maples and sycamores, separated by manicured lawn; a beautiful, curated savannah.¬† The river bended further east before passing under another bridge, Fern Street, marking the end of the park. A playground and gazebo sat in the triangle created by the river, bike path and street, and the savannah on my right thinned into a large clearing, useful for whatever large clearings are needed for.¬†



A single car was parked along Fern St, an old, red Honda hatchback.¬† In the clearing, a stout, short woman moseyed in the well maintained field, some hybrid of shepard and retriever bounded toward her, frisbee in mouth.¬† The woman bent over the dog, wrestling the disc from it‚Äôs grasp.¬† The moment the dog lost tug-of-war it took off, into the clearing, ready for the next toss. ¬† The woman flung the disc.¬† The dog tracked the frisbee, sprinting at top speed before leaping and snatching it out of the air.¬† What a catch!



The woman clapped her hands, smiling.¬† She turned and noticed me, I was still over 100 feet away but smiled at her, and shot a thumbs up.¬† She stopped, glanced at her watch and whistled for her dog.¬† ‚ÄúCmon Reggie, time to go!‚Äù she called.



Reggie trotted up to her.¬† She quickly attached his leash and shuffled to the lone car.¬† She popped open the rear and Reggie hopped in, the hatch closing quickly behind him.¬† The engine started, and before I knew it they were on their way.¬† I guess she was running late, good on her for finding some time for her dog.



I crossed Fern Street.¬† East, across the river, began downtown.¬† On this side of the river, a small plaza, composed of a corner restaurant, a boutique and my favorite cafe, The Coffee House, flanked the south side of the road.¬† Outside The Coffee House, half a dozen tables spread out, all empty at this early hour save for a lone employee, Steve, a college age barista, wiping the morning dew off the tables.¬† A small table outside the entrance had half a dozen cups on it, holding online orders for commuters before they caught their train into the city.¬† I gave Steve a nod, and headed west.¬† I crossed the street and waved my badge at the entrance to the police headquarters, heading into work.



TUESDAY



Last night was fun.¬† I met some buddies at The Lamplighter, a small bar downtown.¬† We watched the Bears blow another strong lead.¬† God I am so glad I‚Äôm not a Bears fan, but they sure are fun to watch with genuine Bears fans.¬† I swear my friend‚Äôs blood pressure spiked 80 points in that last quarter. I got home around 10, and only had three beers, but between being a dad and being in my late 30s, I‚Äôm paying for it today.¬† It took 3 hits of the snooze alarm before I mustered the strength to pull myself out of bed.



I got out the door at 6:55.¬† My truck was sitting in my driveway, I could probably make it if I drove, but I‚Äôd rather bribe my coworker Mark to cover for me.¬† A coffee is a fair price to pay to get my morning stroll in.¬† I shot him a text and ordered two Americanos from The Coffee House. ¬†



Across the street, The Garons had their American flag waving proud and high.¬† Last year, under that same flag, flew Trump 2024.¬† I have to remind myself the Garons are good folks, despite their political ideals.¬† Leslie brought us a beautiful bouquet and delicious homemade lasagna when we had to put our dog down earlier this spring, and she knows we‚Äôre a house of bleeding heart liberals.¬† They‚Äôre a part of our community, and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre here, even if they are a bunch of God damn republicans.



Kids gathered at the corner, waiting for their bus.¬† I saw Bennett, my neighbor‚Äôs 8 year old son, staring into space.¬† I gave him a little bump, ‚ÄúOur deal still stands Benny Boy, you beat me in one Mario Kart race, you, me, your dad and Olivia get ice cream.¬† My treat.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôve been practicing!¬† You‚Äôre going down!‚Äù¬† He shouted as he punched me in the arm.



‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it!‚Äù¬† I yelled back as I made my way around the corner.¬† That kid‚Äôs never gonna beat me.



As I headed down the park path, I watched a great blue heron in the shallow, flowing river.¬† It stood virtually motionless, it‚Äôs focus on the water.¬† Suddenly it lunged it‚Äôs head toward the water.¬† It raised it‚Äôs head, a fish impaled on it‚Äôs bill, blood dripping down it‚Äôs long neck.¬† The fish flailed briefly before going limp, succumbing to the deathblow.¬† Brutal.¬† I continued along the path.¬† Ahead, I could see the old red Honda from yesterday, parked along the curb ahead.¬† I looked to my right, and saw the owner treading along the perimeter of the prairie, Reggie on lead, sniffing asters and goldenrod.¬† A bumblebee flew near Reggies head, Reggie pulled back and nipped at it.¬† The owner turned and noticed me, bracing her hands on Reggies leash.¬† I waved and called to her, ‚ÄúBeautiful dog.‚Äù



Reggie looked up and barked in return, jumping, constrained against the leash, begging to be petted, to play, but she said nothing.¬† She turned quickly, pretending not to see me.¬† She shuffled away from the path, dragging the dog into the savannah.¬† That was weird, I guess she‚Äôs just really shy.¬† I continued south, to the end of the park, glancing at her car as I walked across the road. An old Bernie 2016 sticker adorned her bumper, a ‚Äúcoexist‚Äù just to the right of it, and on the opposite end a sticker that said ‚ÄúPlease be patient, I‚Äôm just a girl‚Äù.¬† I chuckled.¬† At least we think the same! ¬†



I passed The Coffee House, snatching mine and Mark‚Äôs coffees off the to-go table, and headed into work.



WEDNESDAY



I stood at the base of the playground.¬† Above me, Olivia stood at the top of the ‚Äòbig kids slide‚Äô, as she calls it.¬† I tried to reassure her, ‚ÄúYou can do it, love.¬† I‚Äôm right here, daddy‚Äôs got you.‚Äù She grabbed the sides of the slide and squatted, but I could see fear bubbling up in her.¬† She stood back up and backed away from the slide.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to be afraid Liv, just try it again in a minute.‚Äù ¬†



Two boys, a bit older than Liv, were running around the elevated play paths, playing tag.¬† They were rough, and had no regard for my two year old trying to conquer her fears.¬† I glanced at their mother, she was in her late twenties and had her nose in her phone, completely oblivious to the chaos her boys were creating.¬† Classic Gen Z mom behavior.¬† I guess I‚Äôm gonna have to parent these kids too.¬† ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù¬† I barked at the boys, ‚Äúcareful around the little kids!‚Äù¬† They froze, eyes wide, stunned by a stranger telling them what to do. ¬†



Their mom perked up, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak to them like that!‚Äù¬† She yelled from her bench.



‚ÄúGet off your phone and pay attention.‚Äù I responded, dismissively.



She scoffed and called the boys over, they headed for the SUV parked nearby.¬† ‚ÄúSome people are so rude!‚Äù She exclaimed, opening the car door for her little hellions.¬† Don‚Äôt let the door hit ya on the way out, lady! ¬†



I focused my attention back on Olivia. ¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try it one more time.‚Äù¬† She approached the slide cautiously.¬† I positioned myself at the base of the slide and reached out to her.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got it baby girl.¬† I‚Äôm here to catch you.‚Äù¬† She was clearly nervous, but sat down, her feet dangling down the angle of the slide.¬† ‚ÄúGive yourself a little push, it‚Äôll be just like when we go down together!‚Äù¬† She took a breath and inched forward, little by little, until gravity grabbed hold and began to drag her down the slide.¬† Her body was thrown back by the momentum, and she grimaced the entire ride down, bracing her body with her elbows.¬† I caught her at the bottom and picked her up, her grimace turned to elation.¬† ‚ÄúAgain!‚Äù she cried.



After another 20 rides down the big kid‚Äôs slide we loaded into the stroller and headed for The Coffee House.¬† We‚Äôve earned some java and a pastry.



Inside, a room-spanning industrial pipe chandelier, light bars integrated into the pipes at irregular intervals, cast a warm glow onto a large, beerhall-style walnut table.¬† The table was split by a succulent planter that ran the length of the table, and customers chatted with one another or typed away on their laptops.¬† Artwork from the Brookhaven High School Art Department (Go Cats!) decorated the walls.¬† The Shins played at low volume, drowned out by quiet chatter of customers and the pulverizing of beans in coffee grinders.¬† Steve waited behind the counter, his expression vacant.¬† I walked up to the register, ‚ÄúHey Steve!¬† I‚Äôll have my usual, and she‚Äôll have a croissant.‚Äù¬† I said, pointing to Olivia in the stroller. ¬†



‚ÄúHey man‚Ä¶.¬† You‚Äôre gonna have to remind me what your usual is‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† Steve said, glancing at his coworker leaning on the counter.



‚ÄúSorry, thought you might‚Äôve remembered me, I‚Äôm in here most days.‚Äù¬† Come on dude, remember your regulars.¬† ‚ÄúAn Americano, splash of oat milk please.‚Äù



‚ÄúSure thing man.‚Äù



I meandered to the order pickup counter, looking around the cafe.¬† Ian McFadden, a city council member, sat chatting with a middle-aged woman.¬† ‚ÄúHow are we doing councilman?‚Äù¬† I said, walking to their table.



‚ÄúTyler, hello.¬† Good, just having a meeting.¬† This is Sara, she works with city legal.‚Äù



I extended my hand, ‚ÄúNice to meet you!¬† I knocked on doors for Councilman McFadden two years ago.¬† So now he owes us at the police station a big raise on our next contract!‚Äù I said, laughing.



She shot Ian a quick look.



‚ÄúI kid, I kid‚Äù I said.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy to help people who wanna do good for our city.‚Äù



She shook my hand and smiled ‚ÄúWell, nice to meet you‚Äù.



‚ÄúGood seeing ya Tyler, have a good one.‚Äù¬† Ian said.



‚ÄúYou too!‚Äù



I walked back to the stroller as Steve motioned to me.¬† ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your drink, man‚Äù he said with a smirk, handing me my cup and a baggie with Olivia‚Äôs croissant.¬† I headed for the exit and took a swig, ‚ÄúMr Brookhaven‚Äù was written on the side of my cup.¬† I glanced back to the counter to see Steve and his coworker look away and laugh.¬† Fucking kids, I thought to myself. ¬†



It was about 11, still an hour or so before lunch and naptime.¬† Once Olivia was down for her nap I had a hole in the drywall to patch, wasn‚Äôt looking forward to that.¬† I opted to take the scenic route back to our house, to stretch the morning a bit further.¬† We walked up Benton Avenue, a residential street connecting vehicle traffic from downtown to my neighborhood.¬† Lost Prophets blared from my headphones.¬† Benton Ave is flanked with houses on the east side, and apartments on the west.¬† The guys at work say the apartments, Armpit Acres, they call em, is the hood of Brookhaven, but they really aren‚Äôt a big deal.¬† Sure there‚Äôs the occasional odor of cannabis, and last winter a maintenance worker was stabbed in the neck, but the guy lived, we got a guy in custody, and the domestic calls we run there are no different than the ones we have in the mansions south of downtown.¬† Most of those folks in Armpit Acres moved to our town for the same reason we moved here, to raise their kids in a stable, safe town with good schools.



I passed the garden style apartments, their balconies overlaid with planters, folding chairs, kids bikes and ‚ÄúClass of 2026‚Äù signs.¬† The parking lot was only half full, only the beater cars remained, with their beater owners presumably contributing to the smell of marijuana.¬† Among them was the red Honda that I‚Äôd seen at the park the last few days.¬† So here‚Äôs where miss antisocial lives‚Ä¶



THURSDAY



It was just shy of 6:40 when I left this morning, not ideal but I‚Äôd still make it in time.¬† Olivia woke up early this morning, 5:30, and would not stop whining.¬† She asked for cereal for breakfast, but when it was in front of her she changed her mind.¬† Same with apple slices and yogurt.¬† I guess she‚Äôs proof that one can live off God damn pop tarts.



I hurried down the street and onto the path through the park.¬† I could feel the tension in my shoulders, I needed to calm down.¬† What kind of man lets a two year old get under his skin.¬† I slowed my pace and looked at the trees of the distant savannah.¬† I noticed the gentle upward arches of the maples branches, the leaves at the top just starting to tint orange with the impending fall.¬† I followed the sharp angles of an oak‚Äôs massive limbs, showcasing the strength of the wood.¬† The rough morning began to fade into distant memory.¬† Two cyclists pedaled opposite of me.¬† ‚ÄúMorning!‚Äù I called, the cyclists answering with a short wave as they passed.¬† I passed the prairie and the open field revealed itself. ¬†



My vision traced the current of the river when my periphery caught a dark object on the other side of the path.¬† I flinched and looked to my right, realizing it was just our antisocial friend with Reggie on leash.¬† She was standing next to an old oak, Reggie braced himself towards me, against his collar.¬† He growled, propped up onto his hind legs by the tension of his leash.¬† ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù¬† I said with a chuckle, ‚ÄúYou scared me!‚Äù



She didn‚Äôt respond.¬† Instead, she tried to break eye contact, but kept glancing at me, she stepped behind the oak, a shitty attempt to hide herself.¬† I stared for a moment, before scoffing, ‚ÄúOkay then!‚Äù, and continuing my trek to work.¬† What a fucking weirdo, what is she afraid of me for?!¬† She must lead a sad life if she can‚Äôt even a handle a friendly run-in, she needs to get her shit together.



I glanced at her car as I crossed the road, rust spotted the bumper.¬† A crack split the rear window.¬† What a beater.



FRIDAY



I was out of the door at 6:30, plenty of time.¬† It was chillier this morning, I shoved my hands in my pockets and kept my head down on my walk. ¬†



A low fog covered the prairie.¬† Moisture hung in the air and I could feel the cold humidity in my lungs. The sun was just beginning to peak through the clouds as I crossed the street and walked down the path.¬† The prairie ended and ahead, through the orange, sunlit haze, I could see the woman and her dog well ahead of me.¬† This bitch, I thought to myself.¬† She walked along the rivers edge with Reggie on a tether, his nose stuck in the shoreline sedges.¬† She‚Äôs gonna take one look at me and high tail it to her car, I just know it.¬†



She glanced up at me, and flinched when she saw me, fucking flinched!¬† She turned and marched towards her shit box, dragging Reggie along with her.¬† I fucking knew it, this fucking bitch.¬† What in the fuck is her problem, what does she have to be afraid of?!¬† Doesn‚Äôt she understand that it‚Äôs friction that makes the world a good place to live?!¬† Talking to cashiers, waving to neighbors, interacting with strangers is what makes life vibrant, what makes life worth living!¬† This fat bitch, this waste of life, she‚Äôs not fulfilling her social contract!¬† Doesn‚Äôt she understand that she‚Äôs a member of this fucking community?!¬† Be a fucking part of it!



She got into her car, the chassis shifting as she sat down.¬† The engine fired up and she was off. ¬† Enjoy your whole half mile drive, lazy piece of shit.¬† I bet she‚Äôs gonna spend the whole day in her shitty apartment ordering Grubhub and watching TV.¬† She won‚Äôt retrieve her food until she‚Äôs sure the hallways clear, so she doesn‚Äôt have to speak to anybody.¬† What a life to lead.¬† I could feel vitriol in my heart.¬† I closed my eyes and tried to focus on my breath.¬† The leaves of river birches flittered in the wind, and spackled sunlight warmed the left side of my face.¬† The right side of my face remained in the cool, crisp autumnal shadow.¬† I focused on the contrast, on the warmth and cold.¬† I felt my pulse slow, my body calm itself.¬† Am I really gonna let this bitch ruin my day?



Crossing the intersection before the police station, a volunteer for the Knights of Columbus held a tootsie roll toward me, ‚ÄúDonations for the needy?‚Äù



I glared at him, ‚ÄúFuck off‚Äù I muttered.¬† I guess she was gonna ruin my day.¬†



‚Ä¶



I took another rip from my weed pen and glanced at my watch, 10:45.¬† The night was calm, still.¬† Our friend‚Äôs rusty shitbox sat in front of me.¬† I pulled my phone out. ¬†



‚ÄúKFB‚Ä¶‚Äù I said aloud to myself, typing her license plate information into my notes app.



‚ÄúR3‚Äù I took another pull from the vape.



‚Äú92‚Äù



Saved.



I spit at her bumper, and headed home.



SATURDAY



I held my badge to the electronic reader, and, with a beep, the mechanical lock clicked open.¬† I stepped into the police station and headed up to the darkened second floor, just the skeleton crew of the weekend inside.¬† I walked past the large glass wall, unlocking the attached glass door with my badge.¬† Inside, the dispatch center sat in darkness, a warm, low glow from dimmed overhead lights.¬† The only other light came from multiple monitors decorating the three dispatch stations, and a TV quietly playing college football on the opposite wall.¬† Mark sat watching the tv at the left-most station.¬† ‚ÄúMark!¬† What‚Äôs up man?‚Äù



‚ÄúHey Tyler, what are you doing here?‚Äù¬† He asked, turning away from the television.



‚ÄúNothing, kiddo is taking a nap, and forgot something yesterday, figured I‚Äôd swing by‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, rocking back and forth on my feet.¬† ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve got a favor to ask of you.‚Äù



Mark raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúWhat do ya need?‚Äù



‚ÄúI need you to run a plate for me.‚Äù



Mark leaned forward in his chair.¬† ‚ÄúI dunno man, that‚Äôs really not for public use.‚Äù¬† He said.



‚ÄúCmon Mark.‚Äù I insisted, ‚ÄúMy sister-in-law says she‚Äôs seen the same car parked outside of her place quite a bit the last few weeks.¬† She lives in a nice place, she‚Äôs afraid it‚Äôs getting cased.¬† You know she had that incident a few years ago.‚Äù ¬†



‚ÄúYou mean when those teenagers raided her beer fridge?‚Äù¬† Mark chuckled, glaring at me, ‚Äúin her open garage?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt still freaked her out man!‚Äù¬† I retorted.¬† Mark stared at me, arms crossed.¬† ‚ÄúMark, please.‚Äù¬† I begged, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the police, I‚Äôm not gonna use this for something dumb, just looking for some peace of mi-‚Äù



He cut me off, ‚ÄúTyler, I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick, but you‚Äôre an office administrator.¬† We appreciate what you do here, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I could feel heat building inside me.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to have access to this stuff.‚Äù¬† He paused, ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre not an officer, if you can‚Äôt pass the psych then you shouldn‚Äôt be-‚Äú



‚ÄúI told you that because we‚Äôre friends,‚Äù I growled back, ‚Äúnot so you could hold it against me.¬† I‚Äôm looking out for my family, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù ¬†



He looked away from me, shrunk in his chair.¬† I could feel my jaw clenching, my anger building.¬† I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, trying to calm myself.¬† I unclenched my fists,¬† but could still feel the raw tension in my hands.¬† I tried to speak softly, ‚Äúcan you just tell me if this person has any history?‚Äù



Mark took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need any details, just wanna keep my family safe‚Äù I pleaded.



He sighed, ‚ÄúGive me the info.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I replied.¬† I gave him the plate number as he typed it into his keyboard.



He scanned the screen.¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs clean, no warrants, no arrests.¬† Happy?‚Äù



I walked to his side, leaning over his monitor and bumping his mouse.¬† ‚ÄúCan you give me an address?¬† See if she lives in the area?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to see this shit!‚Äù He exclaimed, grabbing at his mouse and closing the query.¬† But not before I saw her name, Taylor White.



I could still feel the frustration in my gut, but I had gotten what I‚Äôd come for, well, half of what I‚Äôd come for.¬† I continued through the darkened halls and stopped at the logistics officer‚Äôs door.¬† I pressed my badge against the electronic lock, and the latch clicked open.¬† I may not be police according to Mark, but the city deemed it appropriate that I have access to virtually the whole department.¬† Behind the officers vacant desk, a key cabinet was mounted on the wall, it‚Äôs own key inserted in it‚Äôs lock, our excellent security on full display.¬† I turned the key and opened the cabinet, scanning the keys inside.¬† I found what I was looking for, a spare Knox key.¬† I grabbed the key and returned the cabinet to the state I‚Äôd found it.



I headed outside and into The Coffee House.¬† The afternoon crowd was thin, Steve saw me walking in, ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs Mr Brookhaven!¬† You want your usual?‚Äù¬† He laughed, bumping his coworker with his elbow.



I felt my freshly cooled rage bubble inside me once more, as I walked up to the counter.¬† Steve walked up to the register.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just joking man, you want your Americ-‚Äú



‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre funny?‚Äù¬† I said quietly, cutting him off.¬† ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs funny?¬† Think it‚Äôs fucking funny to mock good people?‚Äù¬† I felt my fists clenching.¬† ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre cool?¬† Shitting on me for trying to make the world a bit brighter?‚Äù



‚ÄúWoah man‚Äù he stammered, taken aback, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think-‚Äú



‚ÄúNo shit you didn‚Äôt think‚Äù I interrupted.¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think, life is just a fucking joke and you‚Äôre just here to laugh and make fun, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Steve reeled back as my voice raised, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt contribute, don‚Äôt help, don‚Äôt seek conversation or betterment, don‚Äôt give a shit.¬† Just shit on everything.‚Äù¬† I jabbed my finger at him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with this world!‚Äù¬†



The cafe was quiet.¬† I could feel the eyes of the few patrons bounce from me to Steve.¬† Steve stayed back from the counter, staring, his mouth agape.¬† I stepped back, remembering where I was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go to fucking Starbucks‚Äù I muttered to myself.¬† I snatched a cup off the online order tray as I walked out the door.



I crossed the street, heading back home.¬† I needed to ground myself.¬† I took in my surroundings.¬† The field of the park was abuzz with pee-wee soccer.¬† The limestone crunched beneath my feet.¬† The din of kids learning team sports filled my ears, of parents cheering and whistles blowing.¬† The trees of the savannah, bright with the afternoon sun, heaved with the wind.¬† The same breeze blew dry autumn heat into my face.¬† I raised the warm cup to my lips and took a sip. ¬†



I reeled back and tossed the cup to the ground.¬† Fucking pumpkin spice.



SUNDAY



After yet another rousing reading of ‚ÄòLlama llama Misses Mama‚Äô, I got Olivia tucked in and down for the night.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stepping outside for a few, I‚Äôll be back in 20.‚Äù I called to my wife.



I grabbed my jacket, threw in my headphones and stepped outside.¬† The sky to the west was the deep red of a bygone sunset, rapidly transitioning to purple and black.¬† The night was chilly, and I zipped up my jacket and braced myself against the cold.¬† I walked south to Jefferson and turned west.¬† A few folks have begun putting out their halloween decorations, inflatable pumpkins and plastic skeletons.¬† Orange and purple porchlights cast a queer glow on the quiet houses.¬† A bluster of wind carried dry, fallen leaves across the road, clicking and ticking as they bounced on the cold cement.¬† I really let this Taylor girl get under my skin the other day, but I cannot fathom why someone would be afraid of me!¬† If I could just talk to her she‚Äôd see that I‚Äôm a good guy, just another guy that makes our community special.¬† She could be so much happier if she‚Äôd just participate in society!¬† She just needs to see it from my perspective!



I headed south on Benton, arriving at Armpit Acres.¬† The red Honda sat in the parking lot, a beacon to what had to be her apartment building.¬† I approached the front door and gave the door a tug, locked.¬† I scanned the exterior wall.¬† Behind a large bush, about six feet off the ground was the Knox box.¬† I inserted the Knox key into the lock, twisted and pulled the box open.¬† Inside were two keys, one, small and labeled FACP, the other, large, with DO NOT DUPLICATE stamped on it‚Äôs body, the master.¬† I inserted the master key into the door lock and she turned.¬† Inside, fluorescent bulbs bathed the hallway in sallow light. I looked over the mailboxes, scanning the names written on each receptacle.¬† White, 204, got ya.



I headed up the stained carpet stairs.¬† I‚Äôm just gonna talk to her, let her know I‚Äôm a good guy.¬† Who knows, maybe we‚Äôll be friends!¬† A Wipe your Paws doormat lay cockeyed in front of 204.¬† I knocked on the door, Reggie barked inside.¬† A few moments later the door cracked open.¬† Taylor‚Äôs face appeared in the crack, ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù She moused, barely audible over Reggie barking.



‚ÄúYes hi, I live in the area.¬† I‚Äôve seen you at the park‚Ä¶‚Äù



She stared back at me, ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶. What‚Ä¶. What do you want?‚Äù She stammered.¬† Reggie‚Äôs nose peaked through the cracked door below her.



‚ÄúI live in the neighborhood, I‚Äôve tried to say hi, but you don‚Äôt seem to want to be a part of our community.‚Äù ¬†



She stared at me, ‚ÄúWhat?¬† I don‚Äôt know you‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúWe can get to know each other, when I wave it‚Äôs just out of friendliness.¬† We can be friends ya know.‚Äù¬† I said, earnestly.



She continued to stare, wide eyed, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶. I have anxiety.¬† People give me anxiety.‚Äù¬† She spoke quickly, her cadence unnatural, stilted.¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù



‚ÄúHi Reggie!‚Äù¬† I reached down to pet the dog.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a threat, I‚Äôm not gonna kidnap you or hurt you or anything crazy.¬† I‚Äôm not a murderer.‚Äù¬† Reggie snarled and bit at my hand as it got close to his face.¬† I pulled my hand back.¬† ‚ÄúEasy buddy, you remember me!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the fuck!¬† Why are you here?!‚Äù¬† Her breathing was fast.¬† ‚ÄúHow do you know where I live?!¬† I don‚Äôt even know you!‚Äù¬† She was raising her voice.



‚ÄúTaylor please, If I could just come inside,‚Äù¬† I reasoned with her.¬† ‚ÄúI bet we could figure this out.‚Äù ¬†



‚ÄúWhat the fuck!¬† How do you know my name?‚Äù¬† She was clearly alarmed, on the verge of panicking.¬† This wasn‚Äôt going well, ‚ÄúHow do you know my dog‚Äôs name?¬† Are you stalking me?!¬† I‚Äôm calling the police.‚Äù¬† She tried to slam the door, but I caught it with my foot.



‚ÄúTaylor come on!‚Äù¬† I exclaimed, forcing the door open as I stepped inside.¬† The door thrust open, hitting Taylor on the head and knocking her backwards, onto the ground.¬† This really wasn‚Äôt going well.¬† I took another step inside, reached down to help her up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I-‚Äú.¬† A snarl cut me off as Reggie lunged at me, teeth bared, hitting me on my right side.¬† His weight knocked me to the left, my body slammed into the kitchenette.¬† Fortunately, Reggie‚Äôs teeth couldn‚Äôt find hold and he was picking himself off the ground.¬† He lunged again.¬† I braced myself, covering my head.¬† He aimed for my neck, but his body crashed into my forearms.¬† He gnashed at me, but his mouth only found air.¬† Using my whole body, I threw him across the room.¬† He landed on an end table, his yelp accompanied by a choir of clatter as the corner of the apartment went dark, a lamp shattering as it fell.¬† I tried to regain my composure, and looked to Taylor, who had picked herself off the ground.¬† A fresh laceration on her forehead.¬† Underneath, an expression of fear and retribution. She held something towards me.¬† ‚ÄúWait, this wasn‚Äôt-‚Äù



‚ÄúGET THE FUCK OUT!‚Äù



Wetness hit my face.¬† I was blinded, my eyes burned, my throat was on fire.¬† I‚Äôd been maced once before, when I was going through the college police academy.¬† The cadre coached me through the process, to control my breathing, to fight my panic, to remain in control.¬† I did not have that luxury today.¬† I howled.¬† I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I couldn‚Äôt see, I stumbled backwards into the hallway, Taylor continued to shout at me, but I couldn‚Äôt make it out, it was just noise.¬† ‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù¬† I coughed, I tried to catch my breath, each inhale increased the intensity of the napalm in my throat.¬† Through my blindness I could only see one thing, red.¬† I clamored up and took a step towards the threshold of the apartment. ¬†



I was met with 80 pounds of fur, and I stumbled back into the shared hallway.¬† Reggie found his purchase on my right forearm. Reggie‚Äôs head wrenched back and forth, his teeth shredding my forearm and sleeve while his hind legs dug at my stomach. I could feel warm blood beginning to pool in the elbow of my jacket.¬† I punched at Reggie with my free arm, but his grip only tightened.¬† I was fully panicked now, I howled and shook my arm, a primordial plea for relief.¬† Half blind, I watched Taylor grab Reggie by the collar and try to pull him off me.¬† Thank God, I thought.¬† Reggie finally relented, releasing his grasp.¬† As Taylor pulled him backwards she began kicking me, in the legs, the crotch, wherever she could find impact. ¬†



I scrambled to my feet.¬† ‚ÄúYou fucking psycho‚Äù I gasped, but I was defeated.¬† I retreated down the hallway, past Taylor‚Äôs neighbors, drawn to the hallway from the commotion.¬† I staggered out the front door, my left arm cradling my mangled right. ¬†



I limped back up Benton.¬† My face burned, my eyes were on fire, my nose a dripping faucet of mucus.¬† The turbulent wind like daggers twisting into my cuts and scrapes.¬† Blood dripped from the elbow of my jacket and onto the sidewalk.¬† The night was dark, and I felt the darkness in my bones.¬† I recounted the events of the evening in my head, of my good intentions, so willfully rejected.¬† All I wanted to do was find a common ground, to help her become a part of this town, and this is the thanks I get.¬† I focused once more on my breathing, to calm my racing heart, but I just couldn‚Äôt let go.



This neighborhood is going to hell.

1oa4ed8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1oa4ed8/timemore_s3_vs_1zpresso_xultra/,Timemore S3 vs. 1Zpresso X-Ultra,"Hi everyone,

I'd like to buy a quality hand grinder as a gift for a good friend. He's a part-time barista, so he definitely appreciates good coffee, but at home, he's still using one of those cheap electric blade grinders. It's time for a major upgrade.

My research initially led me to the **Timemore Chestnut S3** (around ‚Ç¨100). It seems like a great grinder with a premium build and I was pretty much set on it. However, after digging through reddit, I've seen some mixed reviews about Timemore's consistency, which made me hesitate.

This led me to the **1Zpresso X-Ultra** (around ‚Ç¨160), which seems to be praised as a significant step up in quality and consistency.

His main brewing method at home is a **Bialetti Moka Pot**. While the S3 seems perfectly adequate for this, I'm wondering if the X-Ultra would be a more **future-proof** gift. If he decides to get into pour-over or other methods down the line, would the X-Ultra give him a significantly better experience and more versatility?

So, my core question is: Is the \~‚Ç¨60 price difference for the X-Ultra a justifiable leap in performance, not just for his current Moka pot use, but also as a more versatile, long-term grinder?

As a side note, I plan to get the grinder's body laser-engraved with some memories from our university days, so the solid metal build of both is a plus.

Thanks in advance for your help!

**TL;DR:** Buying a gift for a part-time barista who currently only uses a Bialetti. Is the 1Zpresso X-Ultra (‚Ç¨160) worth the extra \~‚Ç¨60 over the Timemore S3 (‚Ç¨100) for better performance and as a more ""future-proof"" grinder for other potential brew methods?",2,1760814571.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Hey Twin Cities üåà  
I‚Äôm **Sophie McTear (they/them)** ‚Äî a **color tattoo artist** moving from **Tucson, AZ ‚Üí St. Paul, MN** this month! After eight years in the hot desert (and three years tattooing full-time at Sublime Tattoo under my mentor, Manda Frazier), I‚Äôm beyond excited to join the teams at **Highland Tattoo (taking appointments)** and **Grand Ave Tattoo (taking walk-ins)**. 

I'll finally be moving near family, and I'm so ready to be soaking up the midwest charm!

My work is all about **bold lines with a big heart** ‚Äî tattoos that celebrate who you are, honor your story, and make you feel seen. I specialize in **color-saturated illustrative, traditional inspired pieces** with warmth and softness, rooted in compassion, queerness, and care. I do have a street-style mentality though, and am open to all styles! I can put my mind to anything really.

As a **trauma-informed artist**, I want every session in my chair to feel like a safe, affirming space ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs your first tattoo or your fiftieth.

üìç **Where:** Highland Tattoo ‚Äî 760 Cleveland Ave S, St. Paul, MN 55116  
üíï **When:** Starting November: Mondays, Wednesdays, Saturdays  
üíå **Booking:** DM me or find me on IG u/yourfriendlytattooer

I‚Äôm looking to build community here ‚Äî with *other artists, queer folks, and anyone who believes tattoos can be a healing art form.* If you‚Äôre local, I‚Äôd love to meet you, share work, or just talk shop over coffee.

Thanks for welcoming me to the Twin Cities. I can‚Äôt wait to tattoo some magic and make some new friends here.

I 30F am Slovenian and worked (As support) for a big company with big production plant in Austria. And this guy 46M , was the leader, the top manager there. Big coincidence but he was also Sl0venian. And he was upset and angry with us for taking his people jobs.

So he was the top guy, around 400 people under him. He had a reputation for being intelligent but harsh, intimidating, and impossible to please. But took decisions under pressure in a very short time and I wanted his respect and validation. He never even heard of me.

We had only one interaction - over a year ago. There was a scheduling issue, and I had to call him. I thought that sharing the same langauge and all that will make it better and more personal...

He didn‚Äôt know who I was and immediately started shouting, saying our work was a disaster and that I didn‚Äôt understand anything. We took their jobs and we are now ruining the company. It almost made me cry. he said he doesn't care its not my fault, he wants it fixed. That its not an option I talk to my manager as I suggested, but I have to, its mandatory. He asked me if I can do simple things and do something together here and now, with him. Something really simple and open a file. I asked him to be polite to me. He said he is and I said: you are raising your voice at me. he said yes, because he is angry.

I reported him after that call. It was handled by headquarters, and we never spoke again but he had to explain his behaviour towards me

A year later, I moved to Austria with the same company, so where he is the leader. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to ever run into him again. But a few weeks ago, I saw him at a bar. I said hello, he didn't know who I am. I said hello because I was looking at him and I felt it was awkward. I told him who I am and he said: ah you that woman who reprted me.

He offered me a drink and then another, but we stayed sober mostly. We talked a lot more than I expected. He told me things I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever hear from someone like him. He cried and said he‚Äôs married but unhappy. That he married his wife because it seemed like the practical thing to do at the time but he doesn't get along well with her. said the woman he truly loved got married to someone else. He has two kids, one with autism, and he feels stuck, angry, and tired all the time.

That night, something happened between us that shouldn‚Äôt have( i don't know what I am allowed to say, but you get what I mean). He was very r... ough with me. His wife was at her parents.

The next morning, at the office, everything was different. He avoided me completely. He canceled a meeting where he was supposed to be present, even though it was part of his responsibilities. He didn‚Äôt look at me once when we bumped into each other at the plant coffee shop

1oa4coy,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1oa4coy/anyone_else_been_blindsided_by_bizarre_wedding/,Anyone else been blindsided by bizarre wedding logistics? Because wow.,"So last year I flew across the country with my then-boyfriend to a college friend‚Äôs wedding, small mountain town, one of those ‚Äúonly two decent flights and three hotels exist here‚Äù situations. Plane tickets were $$$ (like, more than I‚Äôd ever normally spend), but we were excited to see old friends so we sucked it up.

We had a brutal 5am departure, a layover, landed around 11am. Ceremony was at 3pm, perfect, right? Get in, get ready, go. Cute.

Except‚Ä¶ SURPRISE! After the ceremony, we find out the reception isn‚Äôt until 7pm. At a completely different location. That 4-hour gap wasn‚Äôt mentioned anywhere. Not on the invite, not on the wedding website. So now we‚Äôre Ubering back to the hotel‚Ä¶ then back out again later‚Ä¶ in a tiny town with basically surge pricing all day because again, tiny town - also each ride was 20-30 minutes.

Whatever. Annoying, but okay. We show up to the reception. By now we are struggling to rally but going strong. We want dinner, drinks and to enjoy time with friends. 

Then we find out the ‚Äúopen bar‚Äù‚Ä¶ is only for the wedding party. That was not stated anywhere. And if you wanted literally anything else? Cash bar. Which would‚Äôve been fine if it was communicated beforehand because again, zero warning. 

Then we get told beer + wine will eventually be open bar to guests, but not until 9PM. Wedding started at 3. It is 7-something. We‚Äôve had airport coffee and one granola bar each, and I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and hyped up.

At 9pm, my boyfriend goes to order a beer. Nope. He picks the wrong beer. Bartender tells him it‚Äôs not part of the ‚Äúopen beer‚Äù selection (??), and that he actually needed to pay for that beer before selecting a different one. The bartender should‚Äôve said something when he order but whatever. At this point, he was ready to leave. Luckily, he never acted rude or unhappy, I just knew he was ready to go back to the hotel for the night. 

All of this could‚Äôve been avoided with a SINGLE LINE on the invite/website:

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúReception begins at 7pm with location change‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúOpen bar is wedding party only until 9pm, beer/wine selection opens then‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCash bar before that, please bring cash‚Äù

Literally anything.

Has anyone else gone to a wedding that became an accidental endurance survival challenge? Because I left feeling like I needed another vacation just to recover from attending someone‚Äôs wedding. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",113,1760814466.0,weddingdrama,28,0.94,False

The nonprofit would:

2. Support local interested businesses (i.e., bookstores, cafes, coffee shops, bike shops, etc.) or community centers in setting up and maintaining a small volunteer area with materials, instructions, and updates on available opportunities.

The model benefits everyone involved:

Nonprofits gain ongoing volunteer support for their causes.

* Be aware that coffee is a bowel irritant. For me, it leads to fecal incontinence. 
* Be aware that caffeine stimulates the bladder. For me, it increases urinary incontinence. 
* Understand that being incontinent is not something wrong with you, but how your body functions. Just as a broken leg impairs your movement but makes no statement on you as a person or your worth. 
* Relationship and social issues regarding your incontinence should not be a thing, but they may be for you as they have been for others. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation in regards to how people are treating you because you are incontinent, you should first of all learn to stop caring what others think of your incontinence. Secondly, you should probably look into removing yourself from these relationships and social circles giving you issue because of your incontinence. 
* As far as products go, you will find diapers/nappies, pads, and condom catheters for those with male anatomy. Condom catheters do not go inside the penis, they reside outside and alongside it like a condom would. Use whatever kind makes your life easier. 
* Do not neglect your skin. Keep it as clean and as dry down there as you can.

But you? You disappear the moment you‚Äôre left alone.
You only exist when someone believes in your act.
You need others to validate your existence.
Talking behind my back only amplifies me.
People who didn‚Äôt even know me before are now curious about me.
They watch me. They observe.
Maybe today they believed your lies but time will expose you.
I don‚Äôt even need to defend myself.
Time will do it for me.

You‚Äôre exhausting yourself with all this. I can see it.
You‚Äôre working so hard to bring me down, while I‚Äôm just sitting back and smiling.
I‚Äôm at peace.
I told you once I don‚Äôt lose.
Remember? I warned you: whatever you do will only make me stronger.
You‚Äôll try so hard, but you‚Äôll still lose.
And me? I‚Äôll just keep doing what I do best nothing.
Just watching.
You‚Äôve made this the easiest battle of my life.
You‚Äôre so predictable it‚Äôs boring.
All you can do is gossip. How pathetic.
I actually pity you.
You‚Äôll die without ever knowing what real love feels like.
You can‚Äôt love you can only control.
Even if you wanted to let me go, you couldn‚Äôt.

You hate being called a narcissist, right? You get angry when I say it.
But you‚Äôre as predictable as a line of code.
Give you an input, and I already know your output.
If you were normal, you wouldn‚Äôt talk behind my back.
I knew that would be your next move.
You‚Äôre so easy to read, like a badly written book.
Every move you make matches the pattern of a narcissist perfectly.

If what we had was love, we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about moves and strategies.
There are no ‚Äúmoves‚Äù in love.
Love flows. It‚Äôs raw, unplanned, honest.
Remember when I told you, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget you because I fell for your eyes‚Äù?
Well, congratulations thanks to all the things you did, I almost don‚Äôt even respect you anymore.
So thank you for that.
If it were up to me, I‚Äôd have loved you forever.
But your cruelty saved me from that.
You‚Äôre the reason I‚Äôm finally free of you.

You‚Äôve taught me so much.
I‚Äôve learned to turn every bit of pain into power.
Even your hatred becomes energy in my hands.
Go ahead keep talking about me, keep feeding me your attention.
Because whether you realize it or not, you‚Äôre still giving me energy.
And I‚Äôm the kind of person who knows how to turn that into something beautiful.
You can‚Äôt have me.
You can‚Äôt forget me.
You‚Äôre trapped in your own obsession.
And all I have to do‚Ä¶ is exist.

I‚Äôll keep sipping my coffee, smiling calmly, and just watching and that alone will burn you.",2,1760814249.0,UnsentLetters,11,0.6,False

My husband tried to talk to me this morning and he literally hit every button on the list of things that bother, hurt, or drive women crazy in their relationships, and make them feel unheard, unappreciated, undesired, unloved.
He literally says the same thing about me on a monthly or at least quarterly basis. He has a million hobbies that he invests practically all his time in. He‚Äôs an incredibly creative and handy kind of person. My interests all take me away from my house/home so I don‚Äôt participate in them as often. I am more of an athletic, active, outdoorsy person. I like to roller skate and roller blade, I love to take walks. I like to hike, I play and coach softball, I love to travel, I love, beautiful things‚Ä¶.anything like sunsets, flowers, lace, gemstones (jewelry yes, but also like rocks and minerals), art/paintings (think museums and art shows where I will often go to amazon to find a print of something that truly inspired me because I love boujee, without spending boujee money), music, sitting with a cup of coffee or tea or hot chocolate, I‚Äôm so typical and easy to read.  I have taken him on so many dates both with small amounts of money spent and no money spent. I love picnics in parks. I love art galleries. I love almost anything‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm so not picky! 
And I swallow almost every harsh thing I want to say. I want to so often say ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt take care of me so I take care of myself‚Äô‚Ä¶.. but he would not receive that well and then I will be stuck in another conversation that lasts too long where I am simply saying the same things I said last time that he won‚Äôt remember by next week and he will go right back to saying I don‚Äôt have many interests like he does. I have dozens of interests‚Ä¶ You just don‚Äôt like them or care to remember what they are. I just want you to take me on a date once every month or two. And it honestly bothers me a ton when you bring up that there‚Äôs not a lot you can do that‚Äôs cheap or free. It reminds me that you don‚Äôt want to spend any of your money on me. 
And the more relationship improvement videos I watch or articles I read, I‚Äôm just left seeing that my problems are pretty much every woman‚Äôs and I spend my time thinking, Yes, that‚Äôs exactly the problem‚Ä¶..how can I fix it? And then I am even more unhappy/sad. He claims to be watching some of them too‚Ä¶.almost every time we talk about the problems‚Ä¶. Then when I bring something up that is important to me, he doesn‚Äôt remember it at all. I refuse to carry on a conversation he is going to completely forget or deny ever happened‚Ä¶.its a waste of my time! We had an incident‚Ä¶.not really a fight or argument, he just did some thing that made me get super upset, and I cried‚Ä¶then he said the one thing on the ‚Äònever say this‚Äô list that seriously ticks me off‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. At that moment I shut the whole thing down immediately and told him if he‚Äôs going to say crap like that I‚Äôm not willing to participate. He doesn‚Äôt remember it at all.  He said something again today about watching some of those videos and I said something about how he still says dumb stuff like I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way and he shot out ‚ÄúI never said that‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt say that‚Äù I was completely dumbfounded‚Ä¶ we just had a whole breakdown about this not a month ago. How does he not even remember these things? I just walked away and stopped the conversation. I cannot have a constructive conversation, argument, anything, if he‚Äôs not gonna remember things we talked about, things that happened, things he needs to work on, anything about me.
I miss the man who wanted me enough to do something about it.

The problem is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to feel uneasy about seeing multiple people for follow up dates‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the etiquette is on that.

I,18F met this guy Barry 43M on an dating app. We both were interested in a long term relationship. I was looking for someone to eventually marry and have children with. He had been divorced for quite some time, took sometime to heal and 2 years ago he decided that he wants to do it right this time and get married to the right women and have kids with that women. Him and I talked for a few days and planned to meet up at a local coffee shop to get to know each other more. We spend almost 2 1/2 hours there just chatting it up about literally everything. Our goals in life, what we‚Äôre looking for in a partner, our boundaries, politics (lol), the things that happened in his divorce, my home life(i still live with my mom) and so on. I can most certainly say it was the best date i‚Äôve been on. I really enjoyed talking and getting to know him on a deeper level, most guys wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough sharing the things he shared with me. I knew then I wanted to take things further and become serious with him, I couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that he is so soft spoken,patient and passionate about EVERYTHING. A few days later we met up again this time he took me to with him to work. He a blue collar man, so he does flooring, installation, repairs, painting, all that good stuff. He works alone so it didn‚Äôt bother anyone that I came with him. I‚Äôll say this now, he didn‚Äôt get much done with me there. He was showing me a bit of what he does and he honestly was just chatting it up the whole 7 hours. He took me to lunch asked me to be his girlfriend, we ran by home depot and back to the house to get back to work. Of course we made out after, then we started talking about marriage. I told him that a person knows in a few months of talking with someone if they see marriage with that person or not. He tells me that I am an amazing and intelligent woman and he‚Äôs see something in me. He also wants to get marred in the next 6 months.  I personally don‚Äôt have a problem with, i‚Äôve seen people get married only after a few months of being together and has been married for 10+ years. I‚Äôm not at all thinking i‚Äôm living in a fairytale but i‚Äôm not going to be closed minded. My mom had called told me she wanted me to come home at 6pm and she had never gave me a ‚Äúcurfew‚Äù that early. So while I was telling him about when i have to go home, I accidentally broke down in front of him about the troubles i‚Äôve been having with my mom for YEARS as the oldest daughter. He reassured me that everything will be okay and that if things get too hard for me then i can come live with him. I thought to myself ‚Äúnoo i can‚Äôt move in with a guy i just met, but then a part of me thought he‚Äôs been really sweet and consistent with me. No guys has ever said those words or would even consider something like that in this day or age. So am i crazy for Considering it? I plan on Moving Christmas eve, so 1 month and a half from now.

1oa3lsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1oa3lsq/help_what_should_i_do_in_this_situation/,Help? What should I do in this situation...,"Hello, 
Please bare with me this is a long one. 

Few months back on Grindr. I met this guy.

Everything I thought was going smoothly, they were going through a breakup from earlier this year and I thought I could be a good support to this person because they were going on how most will ghost or flake or cancel on them last minute and I felt terrible. When we first met, we clicked super quickly.

Things started to become let's say a FWB thing because they weren't ready for a relationship. Which is fair. I met their parents and they met mine. We wouldn't always do sexual things when we hangout sometimes we would go for a beer or a coffee and talk or just relax and watch TV.

So they told me that last month is usually a bad month for them. They have depression in general but for some reason last month is always a bad month for them every year, I didn't ask because I didn't want to upset them because I have my own issues. So to show I was always there for them as a friend I always texted them a good morning text even if they were busy with work and a check in within the day because they said they always appreciate them since they liked someone was there for him but always forgot to reply sometimes, and I told them when they said there depression was getting worse because he was afraid of losing me because of it and also they told me that people/friends usually leave then when they're not in the right mindset ""I rather be here at your low than out of your life altogether."" 

Meanwhile we are hanging out every few days, however things are getting worse for me and also him at the same time, I  won't go into detail just a lot of stress on both our plates for different reasons. 
Last time we hung out, I thought everything was going smoothly... but now...
They're not talking as much, and I'm like ""what the fuck"" so my brain like to go into overdrive and panic guy they will at least send me one text to know they're okay and not dead each day. 

Now they're starting to not talk to me as much anymore and I'm wondering if I did something to upset them when we last hung out. Then a few days I'm getting no answer from them in general and my brain is thinking ""Did i do something wrong? Are they tired of me? Do they hate me?"" They always said if I did something wrong they would tell me right away because I told them is I like brutal honestly. 

Note I hardly use Grindr much anyway because I want to focus on by well being and everything especially during my hardtime and guys in my area. Are very flakey, and I'm not in the right state for that kind of bullshit. I could of just checked it and saw he was online and go on my good old way... but I didn't. 

So I feel like I *smothered* him in a way because I was getting nothing dead air after we were having a bit of a heart to heart text and he said he was getting burnt out from work and with me when I get burnt out I appreciate when someone just checks in and makes sure I'm okay and I didn't want him to think I left him. 

After a few days of not replying because I was a bit worried and I was thinking maybe he's just not in the right mood to talk but still show that you are still there for him so he doesn't think you left him... eventually they texted me ""they were feeling drained lately and need space from everyone nothing against you.."" I told him ""thank you for letting me know, I'll be here."" 

So I go on Grindr and after a few hours he sent that text to see what is up and he blocked me on it. 
They asked for space I didn't explode on them for it maybe they were looking for that reaction. 

Here's the weird thing, they kept me on their social media. I'm just very confused right now. Some of my friends use Grindr and have noticed he's online a lot more now than usual. When he was talking to me they could never find him.

Now I've been confused and my thoughts are like, 
""Do they wanna be my friend and just want space? Are they waiting for me to reach out to them? Do they just wanted me to stop talking to them as much? Are they afraid I ghosted them like everyone else? Are they afraid to message me and think I'm going to freak out at them for what they did to me? Are they going to freak out at me if I say hello?"" 
My brain is playing a lot with me right now. It's been a few weeks and 
I've been respecting their space and not message them at all. I want to badly but I told myself not to do it they want to they will come back to me. Even though they didn't say how long or anything. 

Some of my friends I've been talking to say I should cut contact and block them on everything and see if they notice and reach out that way, and others say wait it out. 

So that's why I'm on here because I'm confused on what to do now. I just want some answers that's all. 
Any advice would be super helpful.

1oa3i2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/rnb/comments/1oa3i2t/india_arie_how_ive_loved_her_healing_music_as_a/,India Arie - how I've loved her healing music as a white listener of hers,"My first India Arie music video that I came across was [I Am Not My Hair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_5jIt0f5Z4&pp=ygUQaSBhbSBub3QgbXkgaGFpcg%3D%3D), featuring Akon. I loved this song!

The singers each describe their history of the many styles their afro-textured hair has taken over the years, while dealing with pressures and discrimination. Of course, India eventually looks in the mirror and realizes, ""I am not my hair, I am not this skin; I am the soul that lives within.""

This song has been affirming for many Black listeners. It also references a cancer survivor ‚Äúbald-headed like the full moon shining.‚Äù Though neither of these experiences are my lifetime, I am a white person who has had body dysmorphic obsession specific to my hair. Seeing celebration of hair variety that differs from mine, I escape my beauty blues and care less about how I look. In somebody else's elegance, I find freedom.

India Arie's songs carry many Black and brown skin affirming messages. I am not the primary audience, but racial healing messages heal me too. My soul has felt sick from the subliminal devaluing of BIPOC and eurocentrism that pervaded my upbringing. I feel that it takes repeated  exposure to recondition my mind, and music seems to help.

At the same time, India's songs indirectly validate my own marginalized experiences that I have been a part of. For example, her song [Chocolate High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8R-vBB4O4) with Musiq Soulchild. It celebrates a happy relationship, which could be any relationship, but perhaps especially one between two brown or dark-skinned individuals, given the lyrics referencing ""your precious darkness"" along with the coffee and chocolate metaphors for a healthily addictive relationship. When I hear this song, I oddly feel joy about being autistic and ADHD. It can feel liberating when people like me ""just get high off our own supply,"" forming friendships with each other and thriving in spaces that suit us, instead of being isolated or needing to stressfully contort who we are or seek approval from people who don't get us. The song Chocolate High makes me think not only of BIPOC partners but also queer or trans ones, disabled couples, homeless love, elder romance, or ultimately any two people finding a flavor together that is so transcendent, the rest of the world fades away. Brown Skin is another of India's songs that can have that effect for me.

I love What If, which names various Black historical figures and asks what if they had never done the things they did, reminding us of our power to participate in positive change. I also love Breathe, inspired by Eric Garner.

I've listened a lot to Video, Just Do You, and recently, Worthy. Along with some of the fun crush/lover songs like Yellow, Cocoa Butter, and That Magic.

I love I Am Light. Like I Am Not My Hair, it balances life experience with being an unlimited soul.

In a [live cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zluMJE-YB30&ab_channel=IndiaArie) of I Am Not My Hair that India did with Joel Cross in 2020, she explained:

>This song is actually not about hair. It's about self-definition and how we define each other. There's a difference between identifying *with* something and identifying *as* something. In this song I'm saying that I identify *with* my external characteristics, with my Blackness, with my beauty, but I identify *as* my soul. And the truth is, racism and discrimination is actually born out of identifying people *as* their external characteristics, and so, we needed legislation to say that people can wear their hair however they want to at work. Sad that we need it, glad that we have it.

Like probably a lot of music listeners, I wish I could meet my favorite singer and tell them what their music means to me. Instead I am telling Reddit! :)

Who here has loved India Arie's music? Do you have any favorites songs of hers? And would you recommend other singers who are awesome in a similar way? Thank you!

But when it comes to marriage i want a househusband. a man who looks after the kids, supervises the maids, keeps the house running like a calm space while i‚Äôm out there breaking ceilings.

I said this out loud recently to my ex, the one who dumped emotional fireworks into my life 4-5 months ago and now suddenly wants me back die heartedly. i told him straight that i‚Äôve lost feelings but if we ever think about settling again, it would only be if he agreed to this dynamic. and guess what he said? ‚Äúif someday i don‚Äôt get a job and want a working wife, i might be a househusband for her but not for you‚Äù.

And that  ‚ÄúHER‚Äù  burned more than i expected. he‚Äôd rather play house for a hypothetical woman in the future than for the real one who once loved him. and idk why but that hit a nerve. 

it‚Äôs not even about wanting him back, it‚Äôs about realizing that even men who claim to love you deeply still want you smaller than their ego. being ambitious, opinionated and emotionally independent makes them adore you as a muse but never marry you as a partner.

so now i‚Äôm sitting here thinking, do i want too much? or do i just want what men have always had the luxury of wanting, a partner who stays, nurtures and supports while they chase something bigger than the walls of a home.
Or maybe I‚Äôm just another woman trying to rewrite the definition of love without making it sound like a feminist manifesto. Anyway, what if I say I still want my intelligent man, but one who doesn‚Äôt flinch at being my househusband.

1oa3dvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oa3dvw/i_went_to_london_in_1998_something_terrifying/,I went to London in 1998. Something terrifying happened on the Underground,"‚Äú*Shit*!‚Äù

The two faces sitting opposite me in the booth looked up at my curse, staring with quizzical amusement. The first, an extremely attractive looking woman of about nineteen, smirked as she saw me gazing at my watch. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Billy?‚Äù, she asked, her voice carrying the thick British accent with which I had become used to the last few weeks, ‚ÄúYou gonna turn back into a pumpkin at midnight?‚Äù 

Her companion, a guy about the same age, choked slightly on the pint of beer he‚Äôd been downing. Dropping it to the wooden table with a *clunk*, he wiped at his mouth with the sleeve of his jumper, still sputtering.

For my part, I simply continued to stare at my watch, as if willing the two hands to begin running backward. Finally, I lowered it and stared at the two. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how friggin‚Äô late it got‚Äù I said, my mind beginning to race. The woman, Courtney, gave a small shrug. 

‚ÄúSo? What‚Äôs the big deal? We already paid for our drinks before the lock-in began, and it's not like we're gonna be booted out anytime soon‚Äù I shook my head. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it. I promised my folks I‚Äôd get my ass back no later than 12:30. This is the first time they‚Äôve ever let me stay out so late. If I don‚Äôt get back there, I‚Äôm toast‚Äù Both of them let out barks of laughter. 

‚ÄúWhat is it with American parents being such bloody killjoys?‚Äù Eric asked. I had no answer to give. I simply shook my head as I slid to my feet, the world tilting slightly from the alcohol in my system.

‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know man, but I *do* know I‚Äôve gotta vamoose before I end up screwed. Especially if the three of us still wanna hit the movies this weekend‚Äù At my words, Courtney jerked her head up to look at me. A sly smile slowly slid across her face, and she leaned over slightly, sliding her hand on top of mine as her blue eyes twinkled. 

‚ÄúThen you better get yourself home, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù, she said, her voice taking on a slightly husky tone, ‚ÄúBecause your cute ass *is* going to the pictures with me to see *Godzilla*, one way or the other‚Äù 

I felt my cheeks burn slightly at the flirt, then found my voice. 

‚ÄúYeah, I should. You have the phone number and address I gave you?‚Äù 

She nodded, pulling a folded sheet of paper from her jacket pocket. Satisfied, and with a final exchange of ‚ÄúLater‚Äù, I slung my backpack over my shoulder, and passing through the hazy clouds of cigarette smoke, headed for the exit.

As soon as I stepped outside, I was hit with a torrent of rain. *Great, still downpouring*. Sighing, I flipped the collar of my leather jacket up and began jogging. It was the summer of 1998, and my parents had decided to take my two younger siblings and I to see our aunt and uncle in London. It was our first time visiting another country, and to me at least, it felt like visiting a parallel dimension; one where the same language was spoken, but everything else was different. 

At first, I loved the tours of places like The Tower of London and St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral. But I quickly tired of it, wanting to get out on my own and experience it as only an eighteen year old on the loose could. And after much pleading and promising to behave, I‚Äôd finally been given the go-ahead. I was given fifty pounds to spend, along with fare for the trains and buses and told to have fun. 

‚ÄúBut‚Äù, my mother had begun, her tone deadly serious, ‚ÄúYour father and I expect you to be back here no later than 12:30. You break curfew, and you can forget being let out on your own again while we're here, am I clear?‚Äù

I‚Äôd agreed enthusiastically, promising I would. And in truth, I *had* fully intended to keep my word. I just hadn‚Äôt intended on meeting Courtney and Eric in Trafalgar Square. But when I‚Äôd locked eyes with the blonde bombshell across the square, sitting on the edge of the fountain in an extremely tight skirt, I couldn‚Äôt resist. The three of us spent the rest of the day just walking about the city, hitting up stores and eventually ending up at a pub where they‚Äôd delighted in buying me the first ever legal alcohol I‚Äôd had.

*And now, here I am running about like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to find a way back to Chelsea before I end up dead meat*. I shook my head, trying to clear the slightly fuzziness in my vision as I raced towards the bright lights and blaring car horns of Piccadilly Circus. A moment later, I was awash in the neon signs advertising Foster‚Äôs Beer, Sanyo electronics, and Coca-Cola. 

This late at night, the square had emptied out considerably, though a number of people still streamed around, their faces hidden under umbrellas as they pushed past me. My eyes flickered first to a red double decker bus as it passed by, then a black cab which was letting out the most Goth couple I had ever seen. I felt a slight anxiety; even though I knew full well I was legally able to drink, years of being raised in the States and constantly reminded of what would happen if we were caught drinking before turning twenty-one gnawed at me. 

*I don‚Äôt exactly feel comfortable taking a cab tipsy, and don‚Äôt even know how to get one of the buses to stop*. Feeling the anxiety begin to fill me as I again glanced at my watch, I spared a final look around.

That‚Äôs when my eyes fell upon the sign for the Underground across from me.

As soon as I spied the large red circle with white lettering showing the way, I remembered the ticket in my pocket. *Of course! I took it to get here, and since it‚Äôs an all-day ticket, I can use it until midnight!* My mind made up, I stopped to let a Jeep pass through the intersection, then jogged across to the stairs. As I reached the top, I stopped to spare one final glance around. Despite the time crunch, I smiled, almost feeling truly like an adult for the first time in my life. 

‚ÄúSee you tomorrow‚Äù I whispered to nobody in particular, then hurried down the steps.

The sounds of the world above dulled as I entered the hallway, my footsteps echoing off the tile walls. Passing by posters for plays and movies, I followed the winding path until it opened into a large welcome area. As I entered, I was hit by a small wave of surprise. *Where the hell is everybody?* 

Even this late at night, and with the amount of activity above, I expected there to at least be a few other people rushing for a train home. But as I stared around the large circular room, I saw no sign of life. The only sound was the soft hum of the fluorescent lights on the walls and columns. I gazed around for a moment longer, then began walking, my footfalls again echoing loudly back at me. Fumbling into the pocket of my jeans, I retrieved the crumpled ticket, smoothing it out as best as I could as I approached the gates to the platforms.

‚ÄúOi!‚Äù

The call from behind me made me freeze for a moment, all semblance of thought fleeing. *Oh, shit, man*. Memories of my mother talking about taking the New York subway as a teenager flooded my mind; stories about having to watch for armed robbers who‚Äôd corner helpless passengers and steal everything from them at knife point. I began to speed walk towards the gates-

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù

I forced myself to turn towards the voice-and began to softly laugh, filling with relief at the sight of what had to be a metro cop striding towards me. He appeared to be in his mid-forties, strands of brown hair peeking from under his cap. I shot a look at the name stamped into his vest. *D. Gittins*. As he approached, he caught sight of the look on my face, and the hardened expression he wore softened as he raised his hands. 

‚ÄúMy apologies, I startle you?‚Äù Still chuckling, I nodded, swallowing before answering. 

‚ÄúHonestly, yeah, you did officer. I didn‚Äôt see anyone else down here when I entered‚Äù I gave a strained smile. ‚ÄúKinda scared the hell outta me‚Äù He let out a chuckle of his own as he finished making his way over to me and flashed a smile. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an American tourist, aren‚Äôt you? Your accent gives it away‚Äù I nodded again. 

‚ÄúYes, sir‚Äù Turning, he pointed at the clock hanging from the ceiling. 

‚ÄúWell, you might not know it, lad, but the station closes in about twenty minutes. The Underground doesn‚Äôt run after midnight or so‚Äù A small spike of worry rose at his words. *Crap.* 

‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head, rubbing his beard as he looked at me. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôre you needing to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI need to get back to Chelsea. I took a train from Sloane Square, but that was a different line than this, I think‚Äù At my words, a pleased look crossed the officer‚Äôs face. 

‚ÄúYou might actually be in luck‚Äù he said, pointing at the signs over the escalators heading farther down, ‚ÄúThe Piccadilly Line doesn‚Äôt stop at Sloane, but it *does* stop at South Kensington, roughly a ten-minute walk from Chelsea. The last train for the Bakerloo Line is already gone, but there‚Äôs one final westbound train for Piccadilly due in ten minutes. If you hurry down, you should make it. Just follow the signs‚Äù

I gave a sigh of relief and nodded, this time giving the cop a genuine smile. 

‚ÄúThank you! Thank you so much, sir‚Äù He nodded, then motioned for me to hurry. Giving him one final look, I turned and stepped up to the gate, sliding my ticket into the slot. It spat it back out, and I quickly slid through and jogged to the escalator. Stepping onto it, I leaned against the railing and closed my eyes. 

The rhythmic metallic *clang* filled my ears as I descended. Opening them as I felt it level out, I stepped off and hurried down the corridor. There were three hallways that branched off the main one. The one to the right was already barred off by a gate, the same with the left branch of a fork straight ahead. Which left only one choice.

‚ÄúWhelp, guess I'm going this way.‚Äù

Taking the hallway to the right, I turned left and descended a set of steps. A moment later, I stepped out onto an empty train platform. I felt another wave of confusion. *The sign at the top of the stairs said this was the Bakerloo platforms. But the cop said to follow the signs for the Piccadilly line. Where the hell am I supposed to go?* The answer came as I turned to the left, spying the sign which pointed into yet another hallway. 

‚ÄúAh‚Äù I muttered, feeling a bit sheepish. I started towards it, feeling a bit surer that I would make it back in time to my aunt and uncle‚Äôs house on Burnsall St.

*Scrape*.

I stopped, almost mid-step as the sound came. It echoed off the tiled walls of the station for a moment, then died away. For a moment, I simply stared ahead, waiting to see if anyone would emerge. Nothing moved in the stillness. *Come on, dude, you gotta get to the other platform before the train arrives*. I began to move forward again, my boots clapping on the floor.

*Scrape*.

This time I froze like a statue. The first time the sound had come, I couldn't figure out exactly where it‚Äôd originated. The echo had been distorted. But this time, it had been much clearer. It had come from ahead, seemingly where the empty platform disappeared around a bend. I felt my pulse quicken slightly and swallowed. For a moment, I contemplated saying nothing. Then, I spoke.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

My voice echoed off the walls, bouncing back as it died away. *Why the hell did you just do that?* *Haven‚Äôt you seen enough horror movies?* But I shook my head, pushing the thought away. *This is real life, not a horror movie*. For a moment I continued to stand there, waiting. Nobody answered my call. A mental image of the cop flashed through my mind. *Maybe he came down a set of stairs for employees. Making sure I‚Äôm not going to spray paint the walls or anything*. The thought made me call out again. 

‚ÄúOfficer, that you?‚Äù Again my voice echoed away into the emptiness, dying away and answered by no one. As I stared, a feeling suddenly fell over me. One that, alone on the platform, was not pleasant in the least.

The feeling of being watched.

I felt my pulse begin to quicken as it grew, shooting a look over my shoulder to make sure I wasn‚Äôt being snuck up on. But nobody emerged from the hall behind me. I swung my gaze back, feeling a mixture of wariness and trepidation. And then a sudden loud noise caused me to jump, my heart almost stopping as a booming man‚Äôs voice shattered the silence. 

‚Äú*Attention! The final westbound Piccadilly Line train will arrive at the station in three minutes. I repeat, the final westbound Piccadilly train will arrive in three minutes*‚Äù 

The sound of the intercom clicked off, and I let out a low, soft laugh as the realization hit me, bending over and putting my hands on my knees. ‚ÄúFreakin‚Äô hell, man‚Äù After a moment, I stood back up straight and headed for the hall. As I reached it, I spared one final look down the hall. *That noise had to be a fucking rat or something. You are getting WAY too jumpy, Billy*. Shaking my head, I entered the hallway, quickly descending a final set of stairs.

Briefly scanning the two maps, I found South Kensington on the right and stepped onto the platform. Glancing at my watch, I saw it was now quarter to midnight. The map had said that my stop was only a few stations ahead. That meant a train ride of only about five to ten minutes. After that, it was a quick climb topside, and according to the cop, another five-minute walk to Chelsea. *I‚Äôll be home well before curfew*. Smiling, I walked over to a bench and sat down, placing my backpack in my lap and waited. 

Inside the pack I had a Sony Discman, for which I‚Äôd purchased two CDs while out with my new friends. But I‚Äôd made the decision to wait until I was on the train before breaking it out. As sure as I felt the noise had been something harmless, I didn‚Äôt want to deafen myself. Not yet. Glancing at my watch, I saw a minute had passed. *Feels like hours instead of seconds*. Sighing, I leaned back and closed my eyes.

*Scrape*.

My eyes flew open again as the sound, now distant and echoing from the upper platform, filtered down to me. I slowly turned my head, looking towards the out of sight alcove about fifty feet to my right. A moment later it came again. I snorted, shaking my head. *See? It‚Äôs either a rat, or just the sounds of the Underground late at night*. But as much as I repeated the thought over and over, I couldn‚Äôt quite make myself believe it. I can't say why, but it just sounded‚Ä¶*off*. As the noise came a third time, something occurred to me. 

*Is it just me‚Ä¶or is that getting louder?* 

I glanced at my watch again. Another minute had passed. If the announcer had been correct, the train would be pulling into the station in about sixty seconds. *Thank God.* I began to stand, but froze as a new sound came.

*Thunk*.

Every muscle in my body tensed, and I flashed up lightning quick. 

""What the‚Ä¶"" 

For a moment, the air remained still. Then: *Thunk*. I suddenly felt my blood run cold as it came a third time, my mind rapidly replaying the last few minutes of my journey down. The scraping sound had been one I couldn‚Äôt place, a sound I‚Äôd never heard before and which I could shrug off. But this noise, a very human one, was one I‚Äôd heard not even three minutes ago as I‚Äôd descended to the platform.

It was the sound of footsteps on the stairs.

*Shit*. At six foot and well-built from years on the swim team, not to mention three years of self-defense classes, I felt confident I could hold my own against someone. But the fact I was tipsy and in an unfamiliar space, combined with how brazen whoever it was to not even try and be quiet, was sending off all kinds of alarm bells in my head. A fourth *thunk* came, and I made a split-second decision, deciding to try and intimidate whoever it might be. I opened my mouth. 

‚ÄúOkay, whoever‚Äôs on the fucking stairs, if this is some kind of joke, I can assure you it‚Äôs not the least bit amusing!‚Äù 

Instantly the sounds stopped, the platform going silent once more. But this time, it wasn‚Äôt any normal kind of silence. This was one that held a palpably tense atmosphere, one so thick you could have easily cut it with a knife. For what felt like an eternity, but in reality was likely no more than ten seconds it hung over my head like a noose. Then I forced myself to speak again, my voice sounding as tough as I could and trying not to slur my words. 

‚ÄúYou keep this up, and I‚Äôll report this! That is, if I don‚Äôt kick your fucking ass first!‚Äù

For a few more moments, there was silence. I couldn‚Äôt tell if they were attempting to quietly make their way back up the stairs, or simply staying still and making their mind up. I shot another glance at my watch. ‚ÄúCome on, man, where‚Äôs the *fucking* train?‚Äù As I lifted my head again, the sound suddenly sprang up again. Only this time, they weren‚Äôt coming slowly, one after the other. They were coming rapidly.

*Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk*.

My eyes widened as I suddenly realized how big a mistake I‚Äôd made. *You fucking moron. You just pissed them off*. I began to backpedal down the platform as the sounds drew closer. ‚ÄúOh shit, oh shit‚Äù I kept repeating the two words, fear suddenly coursing through my veins. As I reached the halfway point, they reached the bottom and stopped. I stopped as well, freezing and straining my ears to hear anything. 

No new sounds disturbed the eerie silence that had descended onto the platform, but all it meant was that the person was standing just out of sight, waiting. *For what?* The mental question made the fear and anxiety well up like a hotspring as images of being rushed filled my mind. I swallowed hard and took another step back.

That was when I felt a large puff of air hit me, causing me to sway slightly on my feet.

It was followed by a loud, echoing sound which rapidly intensified. For a moment, I didn't understand what was happening. Then relief like I‚Äôd never felt before came as the train burst out of the tunnel, the platform filling with the sound of its brakes. Even so, I kept shooting looks towards the stairs. I gave a silent thanks as I saw nobody appear. The train finally came to a complete stop, the doors opening with a pneumatic *whoosh*. A speaker inside let out a small *ding*, followed by a soothing woman‚Äôs voice. 

‚Äú*This train terminates at Heathrow Terminal 4*‚Äù I shot another glance down at the other end of the platform. Then I began to move towards the open doors.

As I was about to enter, something came flying out of nowhere, smacking itself square in my chest. For a moment, panic consumed me before I looked down. And let out a shaky chuckle as I realized it was some sort of paper, likely blown about by the train. Pulling it from my chest and holding it in one clenched hand, I spared a final look towards the alcove. Then, I quickly stepped inside.

The doors slid shut a moment later, the loud humming sound of the train powering back up filling my ears. Feeling the floor below me jerk slightly, I slid the paper in my pocket and sat down on one of the benches. The platform began sliding by outside, and was replaced a few seconds later by the blackness of the underground tunnels. 

After a moment, confident that I hadn‚Äôt been followed, I allowed my shoulders to slump as all the fear and tension I‚Äôd felt flowed out of my body. A huge sigh escaped my lips. 

‚ÄúHoly shit, dude‚Äù I muttered softly, then let out an equally soft, strained laugh. Taking another few deep breaths, I finally allowed myself to look around.

Aside from myself, the car was completely empty. Abandoned newspapers lay where people had discarded them, and what looked like a Styrofoam coffee cup rolled lazily under one of the patterned seats. Leaning around, I saw through the glass doors to both adjoining cars that they too were empty. *You‚Äôre safe, man.* The thought further reassured me, and I set my backpack aside and stood up, holding onto the metal bar running along the ceiling as I studied the map on the far wall. My eyes moved along the line. 

‚ÄúOkay, three stops before Kensington‚Äù I said, making a mental note of them. 

*Green Park, Hyde Park Corner, and Knightsbridge*. Sitting back down in my seat as I felt the adrenaline which had filled my body begin to recede, replaced with a sudden tiredness, I reached over and unzipped my bag, pulling out my Discman and the two CDs I‚Äôd bought. *Depeche Mode, or Tears for Fears?* I settled on Depeche Mode, popping the CD inside the Discman. Placing the headphones on my head, I hit play. A moment later, my ears were filled with the sound of Dave Gahan‚Äôs voice as he began to sing *World in My Eyes*.

Leaning back in my seat, I closed my eyes. As I listened, feeling my body rock slightly with the train, I decided that I wouldn‚Äôt tell my parents what had happened to me. With the way they were, the news that I‚Äôd been accosted by an unseen presence would send them off the deep end. *I‚Äôd absolutely be forbidden from going to the movies with Courtney this weekend. Like hell that‚Äôs happening*. 

I felt the train begin to slow. Opening my eyes and lifting one headphone, I watched as the empty platform rolled into view. The train stopped and the doors opened. The woman‚Äôs voice came from the train‚Äôs speakers again. 

‚Äú*This is Green Park. Please mind the gap between the train, and the platform*‚Äù 

After about ten seconds, the doors closed, and the train began to move again. I slid the headphone back over my ear and relaxed again.

The process repeated as the train rolled into Hyde Park station. As the doors closed, I slid the headphone back on and leaned back, closing my eyes as *Enjoy The Silence* began blasting into my ears. *One more stop. Thank you, God, for watching out for me tonight*. Behind my eyelids, I could still faintly see the glow of the lights. As I began to bob my head back and forth to the music, I suddenly realized they had winked out. They came back on a moment later. 

*Guess the London Underground is like the NYC subway. Certain spots, they hit and the lights flicker*. As the thought finished, they again flickered. In any other situation, and after a lifetime of riding the subway back home, it wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me. But after my close call, it began to make me feel nervous again. My mind suddenly recalled the paper I‚Äôd been hit with, and to try and take my mind off things, I pulled it from my pocket to look at it.

It was a program for a play, similar to one my parents and I had received a few nights ago when they‚Äôd dragged me to a theater in the West End. The top of the program gave the name of the theater in dark red font. *Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre, Haymarket, S.W.1.* I swung my gaze down to the title, reading it aloud. ‚ÄúJack Hylton Presents, Diana Dors and Dickie Henderson in *Remains To Be Seen*‚Äù I shrugged my shoulders. 

*Never heard of it before, or either of the actors. Local talent, likely*.  My eyes fell even further down to the bottom, and I began to read the line which stated its opening date-

And froze. I blinked my eyes a few times, as if doing so would change what I saw. But it didn‚Äôt. The small black lettering remained.

*First Performance: Tuesday, 16th December. 1952*.

My mind raced. *What the‚Ä¶how in the hell is something as old as this still floating around down here? It doesn‚Äôt even look 46 years old. It looks‚Ä¶ new*.

Feeling my head begin to spin, I leaned back in my seat and closed my eyes. As I attempted to make sense of it, the lights again flickered for a moment, plunging the car back into darkness before flashing on again. As soon as they did, though, I felt my body tense. Something in the train car now felt‚Ä¶different. I snapped open my eyes as the feeling intensified. I looked to my left. 

There was still nobody in sight in the next car. I let out a sigh. *It‚Äôs your nerves from earlier, man. Nothing more*. Forcing another sigh out my mouth, I swung my head to the right. And had to clamp my mouth tightly shut to keep from screaming.

I wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.

Someone sat in the far end of the car. Their face was hidden by the hood of a sweatshirt, one of the zip-up styles the kids at my school loved to wear. They appeared to pay me no attention, but the vibes they were giving off was putting me extremely on edge. Not to mention, where exactly the hell did they come from? Nobody got onboard at the last stop. And I‚Äôd have sensed someone entering from one of the other cars. A thought suddenly wormed its way forward, and as much as I attempted to force it away, it remained.

*It‚Äôs the person from the platform*.

The idea suddenly caused every ounce of fear and wariness to return with a vengeance. The same threatening aura I‚Äôd felt staring at the alcove was unmistakable, cementing the notion. But I forced myself to stay still, acting like I either hadn‚Äôt noticed them yet, or simply didn‚Äôt care. *Just keep looking like you don‚Äôt give a damn, Billy. Show some of the apathy that you New Yorkers are famous for*. I slowly shut off the music, pulling the headphones from my head and placing it back in my backpack. 

Reaching over, I picked up one of the discarded newspapers from the seat next to me, flipping it open and pretending to read. I kept it just far enough from my face to glance at the figure out of the corner of my eye. They continued to sit, the only movement being the slight rocking of their body. As I continued to flick my gaze back and forth, I felt the train begin to slow again. We were arriving at the next platform.

The woman‚Äôs voice came over the speakers again. 

‚Äú*This is Knightsbridge. Please mind the gap between the train, and the platform*‚Äù 

Sure enough, the platform slid into view a moment later, the train rolling to a stop and the doors opening. As I stared at what felt like salvation, I mentally argued over what to do. *I can just get out. Dash to the stairs, try and make it to the street before he catches me. But for all I know, doing so could make him rush me. Besides, turning your back to this guy, where they appeared like fucking Houdini on the train doesn‚Äôt just feel like a big mistake, it feels like it might be a FATAL one*.

To this very day, I wish I hadn‚Äôt fought with myself. I wish I‚Äôd simply jumped up, grabbed my bag and ran.

The choice was made for me as I hesitated a moment too long. The doors slid shut, and the train began to hum and jerk forward. We slid back into the dark tunnels. The woman‚Äôs voice came on the speaker again. 

‚Äú*The next stop is South Kensington Station*‚Äù 

Far from making me feel better; the announcement caused the fear to further intensify. If anything was going to happen, it would be between now and the next station. I kept calm, turning the page of the newspaper. I spared a look over at the figure. And couldn‚Äôt help but stare.

They‚Äôd pulled something out of their pocket. Something dark red, rectangular and about the size of their hand, with three circular rings in the top left corner. As I watched, I saw the person tap their thumbs against the other side of it for a moment, then stop and gaze at it. I caught a split second glimpse of what looked to be some kind of a logo stamped on the back. Then they replaced it back in their pocket. Confusion swept through me. 

*What the hell was that thing?* I forced my gaze away, turning to continue pretending to read. I‚Äôd already felt afraid to begin with at the figure‚Äôs sudden appearance; after that bizarre spectacle, it had ramped up a few notches. And it was furthered as the lights flickered again, sending the train car into darkness. My heart beat furiously against my chest, feeling as though it would burst out of it at any moment.

The lights returned, and I cast my eye to the side. The figure still sat where they were. The lights flickered again. I gave a fake, exasperated sigh, as if annoyed my reading had been interrupted. The lights flickered on again, and I shot a glance to the right. And froze. The seat where the figure had been, not even five seconds ago, was empty. My eyes darted around every possible area they could‚Äôve hid in the few moments they‚Äôd had to move. But I saw no feet poking from the bottom of seats.

‚ÄúHello‚Äù

The voice- a man‚Äôs, came from directly in front of me, behind the newspaper. Chill upon chill shot up my spine. I swallowed hard, feeling a surge of adrenaline and fear sweep through my body as I saw my knuckles begin to turn white from how tightly my hands suddenly gripped the newspaper. Slowly, I lowered the paper, my breath coming shallow as I looked up. The hood still hid the upper half of his face, but I could clearly see the psychotic grin which adorned the lower. 

A horrifying realization hit me like a Mack truck. *This isn‚Äôt any ordinary nutjob. This guy is giving off fucking serial killer vibes*. And then my gaze fell to the man‚Äôs right hand. Or, I should be more specific and say what he *held* in his right hand.

A knife, its serrated blade curving wickedly upwards.

My eyes widened as far as they could go. For a few moments, neither of us moved. Then, I spoke, my voice coming out in a weak tone.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶.shit‚Äù

I exploded into motion, using all the muscle in my legs to spring forward and off to the side. From the corner of my eye, I saw the figure lunge towards where I‚Äôd just been. The knife stabbed the seat, tearing it apart like it was paper. 

*That was going to be me!* 

The thought sent a new burst of adrenaline into my system as the effects of the alcohol seemed to dissipate, and I leapt to my feet as the figure pulled back, whirling to face me. All the knowledge from my self-defense classes flooded back to me, and I instantly moved into position, centering my legs. The man‚Äôs grin widened as he watched me, and he chuckled. 

‚ÄúGood. Been awhile since I had a bit of a challenge‚Äù 

Then he charged me again. I spun on one heel, whirling around and allowing the man‚Äôs momentum to carry him past me. As soon as he was, I lashed out with my other foot, the steel toed boots slamming into the back of the man‚Äôs calf. He let out a grunt as he fell to one knee, almost dropping the knife.

Then he sprang back to his feet, whirling around and slashing out at me. I backpedaled hard, having to jerk my upper body back a few times to avoid the blade. As soon as I saw an opening, I pivoted, bringing up one foot and slamming it into his chest. Caught by surprise, he let out a bit of a yell as he almost went ass over teakettle, only stopping as he grabbed the railing. Pulling himself up, I saw his grin widen further. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm impressed‚Äù He chuckled again. My blood ran cold at his next words. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm truly going to enjoy gutting you‚Äù I backed up again, ready for the man‚Äôs next charge.

What happened next, I still can‚Äôt fully explain.

One moment, the man was readying his next charge. The next, it was as if he simply appeared directly in front of me. Shock stunned me, and I hesitated just a moment too late. A searing pain filled my left shoulder, and I stumbled back, clamping my hand to it as I felt blood begin to drip profusely from the slash. I snapped my head up to look at the man, who now held the knife out towards me, the blade dripping with blood. *My* blood.

‚ÄúPlaytime‚Äôs over, kid‚Äù he said through insane giggles. As he began to move forward, a small, hopeless voice entered my mind. *I‚Äôm going to die. I‚Äôm not fast enough. I‚Äôm going to die here*.

As I felt despair begin to overtake me, the sound of the announcer‚Äôs voice filled the train car. 

‚Äú*This is South Kensington Station. Please mind the gap between the train, and the platform*‚Äù 

The realization of how close I was to the platform suddenly banished away the voice insisting I give up, instead replaced with a furious determination I didn‚Äôt realize I possessed. I saw the first lights of the platform appear. But I remained still. *I have to time this perfectly. Just one single misstep and I‚Äôm dead*. The knife rose, ready to slice into my jugular. And I made my move.

I exploded into motion, first pivoting and lashing out with my right foot. A moment later, a sickening crack filled the train car as his leg either snapped or popped out of its socket. At the same time, I snapped up with my left elbow, aiming for his right wrist. Again, my aim proved true, and the knife flew out of his hand, embedding itself in the seat beside him. I heard him begin to let out a howl of pain and rage. 

But I wasn‚Äôt through yet. I had one final move to keep him down long enough for me to escape. My left hand lashed out, grabbing the front of his hoodie as my right balled into a fist. I pulled back, putting every ounce of strength I had into it.

And swung.

The blow connected with the man‚Äôs head, sending him flying backwards. There was a tearing sound, and I felt his hoodie split as I continued to hold it in a death grip. It tore from my grasp, and he fell to the floor in a heap, the hood sliding from his face as it fell apart. His eyes flew up to meet mine, insanity filling them as his panted heavily.

My jaw dropped open.

For a moment, I felt rooted to the spot as my eyes flicked back and forth, unable to look away. I only snapped out of it as I realized the man was beginning to attempt to stand up. And heard the *whoosh* of the doors opening.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate any longer. I leapt over him and snatched up my pack, sprinting for the doors as I heard the *ding* signifying they were about to close. I leapt through them, falling to the floor of the platform in a heap and spinning to see them shut. From inside the car, just audible over the hum of the train powering up, I heard the man let out another scream of rage. 

Rage at having lost his prey. And then the train pulled away. A few moments later, it disappeared into the blackness of the far tunnel. For a few more moments I stared. Then I slowly climbed to my feet, holding one hand tight to the still bleeding gash in my shoulder.

That horrific night was twenty-six years ago. After I got up, I raced topside, where I found the nearest phone box and called the police. Quite a few of them showed up; more than I assumed, along with an ambulance. They took my story extremely seriously, sending some men down into the station as they ordered armed police to Heathrow. Then they took me to the hospital. It took almost seventy stitches to sew up my shoulder.

They also called my parents. I still remember how Mom cried as she clutched me like a shipwreck victim to a life ring. Never have I ever seen either of them that afraid. Courtney had a similar expression when she came to visit a few days later, after showing up unannounced to my aunt and uncle‚Äôs house. The only good thing that came out of my stay in the hospital, was it was where she and I had our first kiss. The first of many.

The cops never found him. They were waiting to check every car top to bottom when it arrived at its final stop. But they never found a trace of him, aside from the shredded seats he‚Äôd slashed into. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt. Not after what I‚Äôd seen. And when an older officer came to take my statement again, it was confirmed as he admitted something.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to tell you, son, stays between you and me. We‚Äôve had unsolved murders occur on the tube for at least the last seventy years, if not longer. They‚Äôve never made the paper, and they‚Äôve always had the same M.O. Person goes into a station late at night, is caught on the cameras talking to someone, then goes down to the platform. The last place any of them have been seen alive is entering the train.""

I‚Äôm 45 years old now. As odd as it may seem, and despite what happened, I ended up moving to London after graduating college. Courtney and I ended up marrying one another, our summertime fling leading to a love that has lasted almost thirty years, along with three amazing kids. Every day I spent with them, makes me thankful I never gave up that night.

But I don‚Äôt take The Underground anymore. I never will. And I forbade Courtney or any of our kids from taking it either.

You see, the police ran a check after I told my story. And they found there was no man with either the Metropolitan Police or the Transit Police named *D. Gittins*. There never had been. But it makes sense. The best way to gain a person‚Äôs trust is to look like an authority figure. That‚Äôs why, when the hoodie tore and his face snapped up to glare at me, I couldn‚Äôt help but gasp as I recognized him, the same green eyes and beard. 

I was never able to figure out what he'd been doing though, what he'd been tapping on before he came for me. No one I spoke to could either. I honestly ended up thinking I'd just been seeing things.

I don‚Äôt anymore.

Because my wife brought home a birthday present for our oldest daughter today. I've never been really into cutting edge technology, and as I've stuck with a flip phone since I got my first cell, I leave getting such presents for our girls to Courtney. When Leigh was presented the box, she let out a squeal of delight that caused me to smile. 

But it was wiped away as she opened it and pulled the smartphone out. One that was a very familiar shape, with an equally familiar logo adorning the back. Even though it was a brand new iPhone, I'd seen it before. 

*Decades* ago.

They say in modern times, it‚Äôs becoming harder for serial killers to operate without being caught. All the advancements in forensics, all the cameras everywhere and social media have created a world in which they can‚Äôt get away with their crimes as easily. But what if they didn‚Äôt *have* to? The thought makes me terrified. Not for the future, but the past.

Why? Because of the other thing I saw that night as I stared down at my attempted murderer. At the shirt he wore underneath the torn hoodie; one which advertised the grand opening of some auto boutique.

1oa3aat,https://www.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/1oa3aat/the_fungineers_x7_long_range_is_a_magic_board/,The Fungineers X7 Long Range is a magic board,"My X7 long range just arrived from Fungineers and I'm feeling the need to sing some praises. And there's not a lot of info about this board out there yet so here's a quick brain dump. Warning: I love this board, effusive praise lies ahead.

For folks who don't know, the X7 is a VESC board made by Fungineers. It's an XR platform, meaning it's basically an XR at heart, it's even compatible with XR accessories. But a big difference is the motor, the Superflux, which is (much?) more powerful than Future Motion's Hypercore. And it has a 20s2p battery pack which makes it waaay more powerful than an XR and even a GT-S. I've been wanting an X7 forever but they were pretty low range at 403 watt hours, about the same as an XR Classic, and range is super important to me. But then they posted this magnificent beast to their website:

[https://fungineers.us/products/funwheel-x7-long-range](https://fungineers.us/products/funwheel-x7-long-range)

The X7 long range, with 720 glorious watt hours of battery capacity. An XR with more power than a GT-S and more range than my Floatwheel ADV1 and 67% more range than a GT-S? I don't care that it costs more than my car and my car has a broken window that needs replacing, I'm buying that frickin thing.

Two months later it arrived:

https://preview.redd.it/y3tckmwtztvf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0844f3189b875178d4879aa455e132d933c92a28

And holy crap all I had to do was open the box, put air in the tire and go. No wrenching or calibrating required. That was a big surprise since my Floatwheel ADV1 was a bit of a trial by fire introduction to VESC, I was troubleshooting that board for so long my friends are still afraid of VESC. I finally got it working (was a bad ESC) and I thoroughly love my Floatwheel, and it recently passed the 3000 mile mark without a hiccup, but it was a rocky start. And I should mention that those rocky starts are pretty rare now with the ADV2, a much less finnicky board to assemble. But still, I was expecting the worst with my X7.

But I didn't have to do a damn thing, and it was just love at first carve. It really feels like an XR but with limitless torque and the most buttery smooth motor you can imagine. I haven't gotten a single motor crunch. No squeals or kerchunks, just bombs up everything I point it at leaving a trail of silk. It rides so perfectly that I haven't even bothered changing the tune yet. That's rare for me, usually I'm all about the Nico's Street Growler tune on my VESC boards (which isn't many, just a Floatwheel and an XRV), I love how carvey and loose that tune is. But I personally can't think of a single improvement I could make to the stock tune on this board. Maybe I'd lower the nose a tiny bit when going up steep hills (adjust the ATR?), but it's all super good, the stock settings are rock solid beautiful and I'm on I think day 7 and I still haven't changed a thing. This board is so intelligently set up that for the moment at least I'm listening to it and learning from it.

I even love the tire, which is a real surprise since I'm a tire changing fool. The only reason I didn't pre-order a Goat tire is that they were out of stock when I looked, but I'm glad because the tire on this thing seems perfect to me at the moment.

And about those rails... I have a pair of WTF's that I rescued from the Future Motion buyback landfill that I was planning to use since the X7 rails always looked weird to me in pictures. But I don't think they look weird at all in person, and now that I've been riding it I'm not going to change a thing. To me at least this board is downright cohesive, everything on it works super well together. More info on the rails [here](https://fungineers.us/products/x7) by the way, something about them being angled 4.20 degrees etc.

And about that ride feel, it really is like an XR, and I forgot how much I love XR's. As most people considering an X7 know, the Floatwheel is like a GT in all it's tall wobbly glory. Which is fine, I frickin love my Floatwheel, when I got it a couple of years ago it was the only board on the planet capable of doing long crazy rides like this:

[https://youtu.be/zsL4KfuxREQ?si=uDaSs6w79BPTW3zG](https://youtu.be/zsL4KfuxREQ?si=uDaSs6w79BPTW3zG)

I thought my X7 was going to be an addition to my quiver as opposed to a replacement of my Floatwheel, and maybe it's the honeymoon talking but at the moment I really don't see a reason to ride my Floatwheel. I feel bad for typing that since I have such a long amazing relationship with my Floatwheel, but it just doesn't have any advantages over my X7. That I know of at the moment at least.  As of now I haven't done any 50+ mile multi recharge rides on my X7, maybe I'll think differently after that. But at the moment I'm grabbing the X7 every time.

About that recharge time... The Floatwheel has an optional 10 amp hypercharger. We all know it's not the best idea to use the Floatwheel hypercharger (Future Motion riders don't worry, your hypercharger isn't actually a hypercharger, more on that later). A 10 amp hypercharger is a ridiculously fast charger. For comparison the GT-S hypercharger is 3.5 amps. I'm sure it's not the best for the battery but I use that 10 amp hypercharger on long rides and it's amazing to go from near dead to full in the time it takes to drink a beer I mean coffee. The less time pacing around waiting for the board to charge the better since I suck at killing time when I can't putter around on a onewheel.

Which leads me to the only disadvantage of the X7 versus the Floatwheel that I've found so far: it only has one charger, and it charges at 5 amps. I asked the wizards on both the Floatwheel and Fungineers Discord what they thought about charging the X7 at 10 amps and the consensus seems to be that it will \*probably\* be fine since the BMS (so goes the theory) is rated at 12 amps. The charging port isn't rated for 10 amps but neither is the Floatwheel's, and I've never noticed any heat on my Floatwheel's charge port. So I'm probably going to damn the torpedoes and make an adaptor to charge my X7 at 10 amps using my Floatwheel charger, let me know if anyone wants a followup on that.

Another bit of geeky stats since it's so damn important to understanding the majesty of this board. All this ""our boards go up to 11 miles!"" way of estimating range is useless, so here's the actual battery capacities of every production onewheel in the world at the moment:

Pint = 147 watt hours

Pint X and XR = 324 wh

XR Classic = 388 wh

Funwheel X7 (non long range) = 403wh

GT-S = 430 wh

GT XL = 486 wh

X7 supercharged = 518 wh

GT = 544 wh

Floatwheel ADV1 = 622 wh

Floatwheel ADV2 = 720 wh

Fungineers X7 long range = 720 wh

So yeah, the Floatwheel and the X7 are the current long range kings, by a lot. I don't want to make this post about FFM (if you don't know what that stands for skip the rest of this paragraph), but nothing from Future Motion comes close. The GT-S with its 486 watt hours seems to me to be ridiculously short ranged, and the fact that it charges super slowly is a bad combination. The GT-S rides well enough, it feels almost exactly like my Floatwheel, a little less power than my Floatwheel but close enough, but personally I've never been tempted to spend irresponsibly on one. I've always accepted that the XR platform is doomed to being short range since that's just always been the way it is, ""if you want longer range you're going to need this obnoxiously large GT frame"", but now that's been gloriously overturned.

Another board worth mentioning is the X7 Supercharged:

[https://fungineers.us/products/funwheel-x7-supercharged-high-voltage](https://fungineers.us/products/funwheel-x7-supercharged-high-voltage)

There's a thread about that here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/1kpcvxh/the\_funwheel\_x7\_supercharged\_is\_here\_134v\_beast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/1kpcvxh/the_funwheel_x7_supercharged_is_here_134v_beast/)

The Supercharged has a 32s1p battery pack. Insanely high voltage. The now deleted user who wrote that review says he uses the board to ride the speed of traffic. That's crazy talk to me, I like to cruise around 20mph with occasional unintentional bursts to 26 or maybe 28, but for me that's just not my thing. But if you have a death wish and don't mind the decreased range (518 watt hours compared to the long range 720) that's something to consider. I don't have any experience with it yet and am afraid to ride one since I'm worried I'll love it.

Anyway yeah, I have no idea how these tiny little companies keep making vastly better boards than Future Motion but in my opinion they do. Floatwheel Tony massively pushed the sport forward with the Floatwheel, then Future Motion responded with the GT-S so they wouldn't look like incompetent dipshits, and now we get the X7 raising the bar again. And once again Future Motion is going to have to do something other than sit around and wait for better better cells to be invented so they can increase the range of their bizarrely inefficient boards. And I hope this inspires Floatwheel to push out a better board as well. They've been talking about a high voltage Pint for years, and Tony said he also wants to make something on the XR platform. Go Tony go!

And I should mention for people who like the GT XL, Fungineers sells the [X10 rails](https://fungineers.us/products/x10-rails) that, if I understand correctly, let you change the X7 into a BTG (big tire) board. I hope they sell a complete X10 board soon.

I have to go protest against our wannabe king and this review has gotten way too long so I'm going to press send even though I haven't mention that I love the footpads and grip tape and build quality all around, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot of other things. But let me know if any questions about the board, glad to answer. And I'm an hour and a half drive north of San Francisco and am in San Francisco pretty often, DM me if you want to take the board for a spin.

Now I think it's following me... Part 1,"Before I begin, I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not an admission of guilt. I am not responsible for what happened‚Äîor what‚Äôs going to happen. That being said, I *am* sorry. For reasons that will become clear later.

But for now, just understand: this is out of my control.

\* \* \*

The party plowed onward like a runaway bus in a 90‚Äôs-era Keanu Reeves movie. I stood by the only working PA, watching as people I knew only in passing danced and bustled around me.

I was not having a good time. The music was too loud, the people too leery and happy, like a kid right after his first sip of Coke. To make matters worse, the beer‚Äîusually my only savior in moments like these‚Äîtasted like battery acid that someone had marinated in cow piss then filtered through a three-day-old sock. You‚Äôre no doubt wondering why I was even there in the first place, given how totally unhappy to be there I was. The truth is I was there for one specific reason, said reason being that I have a terrible penchant for letting people talk me into things.

Back in high school there‚Äôd been this kid, Freddy Lutz. Freddy was a transfer from another school in a neighboring town, who had a very peculiar yet intriguing talent, wherein for a small fee he would do absolutely anything you dared him to. Nothing was off limits. Whether it be streaking during morning assembly or jumping off the gymnasium roof, he faced each task appointed to him with the utmost seriousness. For instance, this one time at Nick Priestly‚Äôs house, we‚Äôd dared him to drink the weird glow-in-the-dark shit out of one of those little disposable neon glow sticks‚Äî*you know, for the lolz?*¬†Anyway, he‚Äôd drank it, and I guess it must have been toxic or whatever cause he ended up in the hospital soon after. Word around school was he‚Äôd ended up with permanent glow-in-the-dark pee as a result (though to be fair I have a feeling he might have started that rumor himself, because glow-in-the-dark pee sounds freaking awesome).

If you‚Äôre any kind of reasonable human being, you‚Äôre no doubt wondering why I‚Äôm telling you this. That‚Äôs fair. And while you might be sitting there right now thinking I‚Äôm just some dumb kid (correct) with too much time on his hands and nothing better to do (also correct), let it be known I in fact have a very good reason for bringing up good ol‚Äô Freddy Lutz.¬†

You see, even on his best, most-Freddy day, Freddy was no match for Mac.

I found him by the keg a few minutes later, surrounded by a handful of other party-goers whom I likewise didn‚Äôt know, each of varying levels of intoxication. He was wearing his Michael Myer‚Äôs costume again, the one with the chilli sauce stains on it, even though Halloween was three weeks ago and he‚Äôd lost the mask‚Äîso just a boiler suit, basically. He held a red plastic cup in each hand, filled to almost overflowing with some dark fluid I hoped wasn‚Äôt blood (although, with Mac, you could just never tell).¬†

He saw me coming and his eyes lit up. ‚ÄúAh‚ÄîNate! There you are. Get over here. Jenny‚Äôs about to light her farts.‚Äù¬†

Mac was my best friend, and the reason for my presence at the party that night. In that sense you could say that everything that happened was all Mac‚Äôs fault, that if he hadn‚Äôt talked me into accompanying him we could have avoided the whole thing and gone and gotten brewskies or whatever. But of course, that‚Äôs not how ‚Äúit‚Äù works. There‚Äôs every chance we could have avoided the party entirely and things still would have worked out the same‚Äîbut more on that later.

‚Äú*Beer?*‚Äù¬†He held one of the red cups out to me.

‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good‚Äîthink I‚Äôm gonna head.‚Äù

He shot me with a surprised-Pikachu face. ‚ÄúNow?! But you can‚Äôt!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚Äú*Because‚Ä¶*‚Äù He gestured vaguely around us. ‚ÄúAnd besides, you can‚Äôt go. If you go now, you won‚Äôt have a chance to tell Kim about how you saved all those orphans that one time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never saved any orphans, Mac.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight‚Äîbut¬†*she*¬†doesn‚Äôt know that, does she? Come on. It‚Äôll be fun. Also‚Äî‚Äù He went to say more, but then a girl dressed as a xenomorph strode confidently past, proboscis and all. He turned back to me. ‚ÄúActually, Nate, you‚Äôre right. You should absolutely go. And besides, chicks hate orphans. Everyone knows that. See ya!‚Äù

‚Äú*Mac‚Äî*‚Äù

But he was already hurriedly making his way after her.

I shot another look around me and sighed. Then I got the hell out of there.

\* \* \*

That was what was so endearing about Mac. For most people, the revelation that you are not the most important thing in the universe is like a hammer-blow to the soul, the gateway to nihilism and crack and all those Nine Inch Nails albums. But Mac? Mac stared out at the universe and all of its meaninglessness and cracked open another beer. That‚Äôs just the way he was. It was a philosophy as good as any other, really. When fate rears its ugly head, you just laugh and go flick over to another channel.

Which is why, when I got the call later that night, and I heard the sheer panic in his voice, I was understandably confused.

‚ÄúNate! Oh, Nate, thank fuck!‚Äù It sounded like he‚Äôd been crying. ‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt gonna answer!‚Äù

""*Mac?*‚Äù I rubbed sleep from my eyes and pushed myself onto my elbows. I checked my phone.¬†*3:32am*. ‚ÄúWhat are you‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs¬†*dead*, Nate!‚Äù

His words cut through me like a hot knife through shit. The fog of sleep vanished instantly, as if just shot by a leaf blower, or God.

‚ÄúWhat? Who‚Äôs‚Äî?‚Äù

‚Äú*The*¬†*girl*, Nate! You know‚Äî*Alien*¬†girl. She‚Äôs fucking dead!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a word for the moment you‚Äôre roused at three in the morning to learn that a woman you do not know is dead.¬†

I pushed myself up fully and rubbed at my eyes again. I couldn‚Äôt seem to process what he was saying.¬†‚ÄúOkay, now‚Äîlook, just calm down a sec. Where are you right now?‚Äù

There was a brief pause from down the line. I could almost see him looking around. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ it all looks the same.¬†*Fuck, Nate! What do I do?*‚Äù

‚ÄúCheck your sat-nav. Get me an address. I‚Äôll meet you in five.‚Äù

I met him a half-hour later, in the parking lot of a knock-off Waffle House, whose most defining feature seemed to be that it was no longer open for business. I‚Äôd have gotten there sooner, but in his panicked state Mac had sent me the wrong address three times, his shaking hands unable to text properly.¬†

I pulled up and he immediately jumped in, slamming the door behind him.¬†

‚ÄúFuck. I thought you were never gonna get here‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, slinking down into the seat. He looked awful, his face pale and ashy, his eyes red from crying. A film of clear snot covered his top lip. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking believe this is happening.¬†*Like, is this even real?*¬†What the actual fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù

I had gotten a little bit of what had gone down during our phone call earlier. Supposedly, he and the¬†*Alien*¬†girl‚Äîwhose real name, turns out, was Ashley‚Äîhad hit it off pretty good, and had gone back to her place so they could, and I quote, ‚Äúkeep the party going‚Äù. They were just starting to get into things when she‚Äôd suddenly sat bolt upright, eyes wide, pointing at something in the corner of the room, something Mac couldn‚Äôt see. Exactly what had happened next still wasn‚Äôt clear, but suffice it to say when it was over, Ashley the xenomorph was dead.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre sure you couldn‚Äôt have just, you know‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

He whirled on me. ‚ÄúJust what‚Äî*imagined*¬†it? You think I‚Äôm¬†*high*?‚Äù

‚Äú*Are you?*‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.¬†*Yes*‚Äîshit, what does it matter? I know what I saw.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should call the cops.‚Äù

He shot me a look like I was the captain of the idiot Olympics. ‚ÄúAre you out of your freaking mind? They‚Äôll say I killed her!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that. And besides, this isn‚Äôt a joke, Mac. This is serious. Someone is dead. We have to tell someone.‚Äù

He fell quiet and sat back in his seat, suddenly deflated. It took me a moment to realize he was crying again. ‚ÄúYou should have seen it, Nate‚Ä¶ the way her head twisted on her neck like that. Like her head was trying to rip itself right off her shoulders. *Could a seizure do that, do you think?*‚Äù

I said nothing. I had no fucking idea.

A tense silence followed. We stared through the windshield, neither of us talking, Mac working his way through cigarette after cigarette as if he could smoke the events of that evening away, having to hold the lighter with both hands to stop it from shaking. At some point it must have started raining, the world beyond the Hyundai‚Äôs windshield now hidden behind a sheet of rippling water.¬†

After what felt like a very long time, I turned back to him. ‚ÄúWell, if we‚Äôre not calling the cops, we should probably think about what we‚Äôre going to do next. You remember if you left any incriminating evidence over there? Anything that might point the cops in your direction?‚Äù

Right here you‚Äôre probably wondering why I would so readily tag myself in as his accomplice, given the stakes. I get that. I could go into a long spiel about ‚Äúthe power of friendship‚Äù, how we had known each other since we were five, but the truth is we were homies, and either you‚Äôre the sort of person that gets what that means or you‚Äôre not. And if you‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ honestly, I feel bad for you.

He began patting down his pockets. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. We‚Äôd only just‚Äî‚Äù He froze. ‚Äú*Oh, fuck...*‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy¬†*phone*, Nate.‚Äù

For a moment this confused me. ‚ÄúYou have your phone, dumbass. Why the hell do you think I‚Äôm even here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not¬†*that*¬†one. The other one. My fucking‚Ä¶ work phone, or whatever.‚Äù

The phone he was referring to was the one he used to text his ‚Äòcustomers‚Äô whenever a new shipment came in‚Äîby which I mean he used it to sell weed. It was his weed phone. Or occasionally stronger stuff, if he could get his hands on it. Downers, mostly. Nothing crazy.

If I‚Äôm making him sound like some kind of criminal mastermind right now, he‚Äôs not. Less¬†*Breaking Bad...*¬†more¬†*Pineapple Express*, only if every character died in the first ten minutes.

‚ÄúOh, fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhat am I gonna do? They‚Äôre gonna know I was there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have to go get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPiss on that! I‚Äôm not going back in there!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice. It‚Äôs that or jail. So, what‚Äôs it gonna be?‚Äù

We stared at each other across the car, a single word visible in each other‚Äôs eyes.

*Fuck.*

\* \* \*

Ashley‚Äôs apartment was on the second floor of a beige, low-rent apartment complex across town, one that looked like the only thing still holding it together was the sheer will of its tenants.¬†

We parked around back and took the stairs one at a time, the two of us feeling like criminals as we crept up each weathered step, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible, even though it was still the middle of the night.¬†

At the top of the stairs, we paused.¬†

The door to Ashley‚Äôs apartment was standing open, just as Mac had left it.¬†

We stared at it.

‚ÄúThis is a bad idea,‚Äù Mac said.¬†

‚ÄúShit, you got a better one, I‚Äôm all ears. Now come on.‚Äù

Ashley‚Äôs apartment was a lot bigger on the inside than it had looked from the stairs. Essentially just one large room‚Äîwhat might have passed for a pretty cool loft, if not for the mess, and the clutter, and the evident lack of any real attempt to make it so. A faint charred smell hung in the air; the ghost of an overcooked lasagna, perhaps, along with another smell, one I had come to think of as ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù

Lying strewn in the middle of the floor was Ashley.

‚ÄúOh, fuck,‚Äù I said.

Her xenomorph costume was nowhere in sight, the only thing adorning her cooling flesh now being that of a pair of off-white colored panties, and what I assumed to be a previous boyfriend‚Äôs oversized tee. I stared down at her glassy eyes, partially hidden behind a mop of thick copper hair. There was something off about her neck, I noticed, like it had been stretched beyond its natural limit, and could now never revert to the state it had been before, just like how it is with slinkies.

I had never seen a dead body before‚Äînot a real one, anyway. I‚Äôd always assumed that in the event I ever did, it‚Äôd be this big, profound moment, like how it is in the movies. But really, all I felt was sad. Because once you peel back the curtain, turns out dead is just dead.

Mac and I continued to stare at her, our hearts pounding so loud I was genuinely concerned we‚Äôd wake the neighbors.

Finally, I said, ‚ÄúOkay. Now let‚Äôs speedrun this shit and get the hell out of here.‚Äù

And so our hunt for the elusive weed phone began.

We pawed between couch cushions, looked under shelves, the two of us trying and failing not to look at the body of the dead girl currently stiffening on the rug three feet away from us. Our shoes left wet tracks on the faux-wood floor as we walked, causing me to wonder if that was the sort of thing you could get DNA from, if I even wanted to know. At some point it occurred to us it would be simpler to just call the phone, but of course that only worked if the phone you were trying to call had battery, which Mac‚Äôs did not, because of course it didn‚Äôt.¬†

Just off the main space was a door.¬†

Figuring it couldn‚Äôt hurt, I tiptoed over and pushed down the handle, finding myself suddenly in a bathroom about the exact size and shape of your typical prison cell. Just a toilet and one of those walk-in showers, really, the stall door fogged with what looked to be years of untended mildew growth. One glance around was enough to determine that, unless Mac had stashed it in the toilet tank (which, knowing Mac, wasn‚Äôt totally off the cards), the weed phone wasn‚Äôt in here.¬†

Satisfied, I turned to leave, but as I was making my way out the door something to my left caught my eye.¬†

I stepped over to the medicine cabinet, frowning.

Somebody had taped over the mirror‚Äîand gone to great lengths, apparently. Just ribbons and ribbons of thick red electrical tape, stretched so as to cover the mirror‚Äôs entire surface.¬†

I stared at this, momentarily dumbfounded, and not sure exactly why. It was just a mirror. No big deal.¬†*So then why did looking at it make me feel so... weird?*

I was still contemplating this when I heard a startled cry from back out in the other room.

Suddenly panicked, I darted back out through the door to find Mac now bent over with his hands on his knees, breathing hard.

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat is it?!‚Äù I wondered if we were under attack. Jesus, that‚Äôd be all we needed.

Instead of answering, he lifted his hand and pointed.

I shifted my gaze to where he was pointing, to a desk sat propped against the apartment‚Äôs far wall. On the desk was a laptop‚Äîa MacBook. A dull blue light emanated from its screen.

It hadn‚Äôt been like that a moment ago.

‚ÄúMotherfucker almost gave me a heart attack...‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you do that?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I was just standing here, and the thing clicked on all by itself. Damn near gave me a prolapse.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure you didn‚Äôt jog it, or something?‚Äù

‚Äú*From all the way over here?!*‚Äù

I stepped across the room and leaned down.¬†

Staring back at me from the screen was some chat site I‚Äôd never heard of. The interface was barebones‚Äîjust a grey chat window with white text and a black sidebar listing a handful of users, most of whom had names that looked like throwaway accounts. They seemed to be talking about some kind of game. One I‚Äôd never heard of.

*The hell is this shit?*

‚Äú*The Raggedy Man?*‚Äù said Mac, leaning over my shoulder. I hadn‚Äôt even heard him move. ‚ÄúThe fuck‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think it means?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know. And I didn‚Äôt want to know. All of a sudden, the laptop was giving me bad vibes, like it had bad ju-ju, or whatever. Like with the mirror, there was no real reason for that to be the case. But there it was, all the same.

‚ÄúOh, hey, look!‚Äù said Mac suddenly from behind me, startling me for what felt like the millionth time. ‚ÄúThere it is!‚Äù

I looked down to where he was pointing, and sure enough, there was his weed phone, lying half-hidden beneath a pile of unopened mail, and what looked suspiciously like a novelty bong shaped like a wizard‚Äôs dick.

*Well‚Äîat least that‚Äôs one mystery solved.*

Before leaving, I shot one last look back at Ashley and her slinky-neck. I wondered briefly if I should say something, like her freaking‚Ä¶¬†*last rites*¬†or whatever, then figured if there was anything left to be said, it certainly wasn‚Äôt by me. And she sure-as-shit wasn‚Äôt going to hear it.

And so, like the dumbasses we were, we fled.¬†

I guess that was how it started, or whatever.

\* \* \*

The next few days passed in a blur of denial, coffee, and fitful, nightmare-laden sleep.

I returned to work‚Äîas a sales assistant over at Regals, selling overpriced vinyls to stoned trust-fund kids cosplaying as middle-class Americans to justify their need for angsty, rage-fuelled metal music.

For the most part, I kept myself busy‚Äîhelping customers, handling returns‚Äîand when Marcus suggested a surprise midweek stock-check, I promptly volunteered, grateful for any excuse to stay moving and keep my brain on anything other than dead girls with too-long necks.¬†

But even as I tried, thoughts of Ashley were never far from my mind.¬†

*Had we done the right thing, leaving her like that?*¬†

I told myself there was nothing else we could have done‚Äîafter all,¬†*we*¬†hadn‚Äôt killed her. The seizure had‚Äîeven if, granted, we had no idea exactly how. We weren‚Äôt doctors, let alone coroners. Was it possible to seize so hard you broke your own neck? Wasn‚Äôt that supposed to be, like, really hard to do? And what was that shit with the mirror?

I was still contemplating this when the man in the beige tracksuit wandered in.

He was a tall guy. Skinny‚Äîbut not in an eating-disorder kind of way. More¬†*lithe*, like the guy ran track, or did meth, maybe. The kind of guy you‚Äôd expect to find at the gym doing bodyweight exercises while pounding down a smoothie. His hair was bleached a hateful blond, and his skin‚Äîthe parts I could see‚Äîwas slick and shiny with wet, like the guy had just crawled out of a river, or a Hugo Boss commercial. I noticed he was very pale.

‚ÄúHelp you?‚Äù I said.

He wandered over to the counter behind which I stood. I became acutely aware I was the only person on the floor. Goddamn Marcus.

We stared at each other.

I said, ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Welcome to Regals. Was there something I could help you with?‚Äù

*A towel, maybe‚Ä¶*

Instead of answering, he very slowly pulled his hands out of his pockets and laid them on the counter.

There was something wrong with his fingers, I saw at once; all wrinkly and pruned, like how they get when you stay in the bath for too long. Deep cuts covered them in unsightly gashes, each one a bloodless, gaping smile‚Äîwhat you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking were defensive wounds.

I gasped and took an unconscious step back. ‚ÄúOh‚Äîshit! Hey, are you‚Äî?‚Äù

The man opened his mouth, and I watched in dumb horror as a river of brackish, black water dumped out onto the counter, spattering off the glass; an inhuman amount, an amount that was surely impossible.

I opened my mouth to scream‚Äî

*‚ÄúNate?‚Äù*

I blinked, and suddenly the man in the beige tracksuit was gone.

I spun my head around, confused and in a panic, and it was only then that I spotted Marcus standing behind me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Christ, you look awful. Are you sick?‚Äù His eyes were very wide.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm‚Äî*was there a guy here just now*?‚Äù

‚ÄúA guy?‚Äù He looked around the empty store, bewildered.

‚ÄúYeah. Tall guy. In a tracksuit?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just you and me, my man.‚Äù He eyed me over. ‚ÄúYo, you good?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to answer, then let it fall shut again.¬†

I had no fucking idea.

\* \* \*

The rest of that afternoon passed mostly without incident. To his credit, Marcus offered to let me have the rest of the afternoon off, but I declined, assuring him that I was fine, even though I clearly wasn‚Äôt. Of course, the fact that I really needed the paycheck definitely played a part, and while I didn‚Äôt think Marcus would use my going home early as an excuse to dock my pay, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure he wouldn‚Äôt, either.

During my break, I had a sudden brainwave and snuck into Marcus‚Äô office where we keep the feed for the security cameras, already knowing what I‚Äôd find, but needing to check anyway.

There had been no man in a tracksuit, turns out, just as I‚Äôd known there wouldn‚Äôt be‚Äîbeige or otherwise.

Which meant only one of two things; either I had hallucinated the whole ordeal, or there really had been somebody there, one who could not only teleport, but also seemingly knew how to manipulate surveillance footage. Of course, I knew the idea I had just suffered some kind of miniature stroke, or seismic brain-fart, wasn‚Äôt entirely off the cards, either; an echo of a bad trip, perhaps, taken long ago.¬†*And hell, didn‚Äôt they say that stuff stayed in your system?*

*Or maybe the whole thing with Ashley has rattled you more than you‚Äôd like to admit?*¬†my Judas of a brain offered.¬†*Maybe you‚Äôre rattled and now this is you finally losing it?*¬†

Hmm‚Äîtouch√©, brain. Touch√©‚Ä¶

I decided to swing by Mac‚Äôs on the way back from work. He‚Äôd been conspicuously quiet since the whole thing back over at Ashley‚Äôs‚Äîwhich wasn‚Äôt surprising, considering. I told myself it was to check on him, but really what I was seeking was comfort; some semblance of normalcy after the batshit-crazy thing I‚Äôd just witnessed‚Äîeven if only to reassure myself that I wasn‚Äôt losing it, after all. And besides, I figured he owed me.

Mac‚Äôs place was a forgettable two-storey brick apartment complex across town, tucked between a vape shop and a shuttered laundromat. The hallway stank of burnt oil and cat piss, and one of the overhead strip lights always flickered intermittently, strobing just enough to make you feel like you were walking straight into an Eli Roth movie. Dick-themed graffiti lined the walls‚Äîand in some places, even the ceiling‚Äîthe oversized (and oddly veiny) members looming down on us in all their menacing, phallic glory.

I stopped in front of Mac‚Äôs door and raised my hand to knock‚Äî

I paused.

The front door was standing open.

I got a brief flashback to Ashley the xenomorph‚Äôs place from the other night.

‚ÄúMac?‚Äù I called, gently pushing my head through the door.¬†

The inside of his apartment was dim‚Äîonly a few scattered candles provided any light, their flickering glow casting warped shadows across the walls. The living room‚Äînever the cleanest of spaces‚Äînow looked like a ritual site for some kind of dollar-store exorcism. Burnt-out tealights littered every available surface. Empty beer cans and bottles of what I thought were some kind of exotic European vodka lay strewn all over the coffee table, tipped over like casualties after an intense battle. Casting my gaze downward I saw salt (or what I¬†*hoped*¬†was salt) had been poured in jagged rings around the couch, the windows, even the goddamn TV. Every reflective surface I could see‚Äîmirrors, black screen, even a chrome toaster‚Äîhad been taped over with receipts, newspaper, or just turned to face the wall.

‚ÄúMac?‚Äù I tried again, louder this time. I pushed my way into his apartment, hearing empty cans clatter as I pushed them aside. Immediately I was hit with a smell; a smell like old food and sweat and burnt candles, all mixed together in a heady cocktail of stale farts and alcoholism.¬†

I proceeded further into the apartment, kicking my way through old takeout boxes and strewn clothing items, wondering as I did so what exactly could have happened that had seen Mac‚Äôs apartment turned into the morning after at a frat party (of course, knowing Mac there was every chance it had always looked this way, and I was only just now noticing).

I stepped into the bathroom‚Äî

‚ÄúMac?‚Äù

He was standing in the tub, fully clothed, hands wrapped tightly around his signed Barry Bonds baseball bat, the one with the words HOME INVASION NEGOTIATOR written on it in thick sharpie, holding it out in front of him like a priest warding off a vampire. His eyes were bloodshot and too-wide, and there was an almost feral look about him, like how a man might look upon finding himself backed into a corner by a mob of giant, sex-starved orangutans.

He screamed as I entered and raised the bat high.

I held up my hands. ‚ÄúWhoa! Whoa! Chill! It‚Äôs me!‚Äù

He let out a long breath and lowered it. ‚ÄúJesus, Nate! I almost brained you!‚Äù His voice was hoarse, like he hadn‚Äôt used it properly in days. I realized I could smell him, too; the smell of male sweat and booze, underpinned by the bitter stink of cheap, dollar store candles. ‚ÄúHow did you even get in here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean how did I get in here? Your front door was open.‚Äù I considered, then added, ‚Äú*Why are you in the bath?*‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck in here!‚Äù

He grabbed me by the shoulder and yanked me inside, kicking the door shut with his foot before promptly collapsing against the wall. ‚ÄúOh, man‚Äîthat was too close‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked awful. There were deep bags under his eyes, so dark it looked like he had stepped into a teleporter with a raccoon, and something had gone terribly wrong. A nearly spent roll of toilet paper sat on the floor next to the tub, like it had been drafted in for emotional support. He‚Äôd lost weight, too, I noted, his FUNK DA POLEECE hoodie now hanging off him in unnatural ways. He looked like the poster child for an anti-meth campaign, one that would by all appearances be very effective.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on with you?‚Äù I said, staring down at him. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt answer my calls for days. Now I come over and you‚Äôre springing out of the bathtub like some fucked up game of jack-in-the-box?¬†*What gives?*¬†*Do I need to call an intervention?*‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand...‚Äù

‚ÄúSo¬†*tell*¬†me. What the fuck is up with you?‚Äù

He looked up at me then, and I saw there were tears in his eyes. He shook his head. ‚ÄúWe should have never gone there.‚Äù

‚Äú*Where?*‚Äù I said, even though, really, I already knew. ‚ÄúYou mean Ashley‚Äôs.‚Äù

He gave a barely perceptible nod. All of a sudden, it was like I was looking at a child; a small, terrified child, one who was clearly exhausted.

*What the fuck, Mac?*

I listened as he explained a little about what had been going on.¬†

It had started as noises around his apartment, apparently. A thud here, a scratch there. Little things, things you could almost chalk up to your imagination. But then the voices had begun. They were never clear; little more than snatches of whispered conversation, always just behind him, causing him to frequently spin around, convinced he‚Äôd find someone standing there‚Äîbut of course, there never was.

Then, after the voices, came the visions.

‚ÄúI had to leave,‚Äù he said, pulling his knees up to his chest as he recounted, reminding me again of a child. ‚ÄúJust get away. I tried to go to Audrey‚Äôs, but she kicked me out, said I could come back when I stopped ‚Äúbeing weird‚Äù‚Äîwhatever that means. Can you believe that shit?‚Äù He took a swig from the bottle of JD placed conveniently beside him. ‚ÄúSo anyway, I‚Äôm walking back, and that‚Äôs when I first see them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThem?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who they are. Just fucking¬†*people*, man, you know? Just staring at me. Shit, you ever had days like that? Like wherever you go, people are just staring at you, like there‚Äôs something on your face, or whatever? It was like that, only worse.¬†*Way*¬†worse. I swear I could actually¬†*feel*¬†their gazes on my back. I would have chalked it up to my imagination, if it weren‚Äôt for the other thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOther thing?‚Äù I said, not really wanting to know, but knowing I had no choice. ‚ÄúWhat other thing? You‚Äôre not making any sense.‚Äù

What he said next sent a jolt of ice through my balls.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ think they were dead.‚Äù

I went very still.¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck do you mean, ‚Äòdead‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean¬†*dead*, man, what do you think I mean? The way they¬†*looked*, the way they¬†*moved*‚Äîit was like they‚Äôd been, I don‚Äôt know, broken, or something‚Äîbut there‚Äôs more.‚Äù He met my gaze again, and I saw he was openly sobbing. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ I think Ashley was with them.‚Äù

I stared down at him for a long moment, barely breathing. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I thought briefly of my beige tracksuit man, how he‚Äôd appeared back at Regals‚Äîlike a corpse dragged from a riverbed‚Äîand promptly pushed the thought away.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù I said, squatting down beside him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been through a lot recently, okay? The whole thing with Ashley‚Ä¶ it was¬†*awful*. But you have to understand, the things you‚Äôre seeing‚Ä¶ none of it is¬†*real*, okay? It‚Äôs all in your head. It‚Äôs just stress‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI went to her apartment.‚Äù

His words hit me like a pie to the face.¬†

‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre joking...‚Äù

Instead of answering, he reached over into the tub, and like a shitty magician pulled out a slim black laptop‚Äîone I recognized immediately to be the same one from Ashley‚Äôs apartment.

I gawped at him. ‚ÄúYou stupid motherfucker. Are you out of your goddamn mind? What if somebody had seen you?‚Äù

He held the laptop out to me, handling it like how one might handle an ancient artefact. ‚ÄúThe stuff on her computer, Nate‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all true. All of it. I mean, I wasn‚Äôt sure at first, not really, but now I know for certain. Once you‚Äôve seen it, learned about it‚Äîhell, even¬†*heard its name*, that‚Äôs it. Game over, man, game over.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat why you taped over all the mirrors?‚Äù I said, not trying to be a smart-ass, but unable to help myself. In my defense, it was late, I was tired, and all this hocus-pocus bullshit was seriously starting to piss me off. I mean what were we even talking about here, ghosts? What were we, ten?

I was expecting him to come back at me at that, but instead he just lowered his head. I saw his shoulders bobbing, realized he‚Äôd resumed crying.

‚ÄúWill you stay?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust for tonight? Please? I don‚Äôt want to be alone.‚Äù

I stared down at his big stupid face, wanting to tell him no, fuck that, that I was done with ghost stories for the evening‚Äîbut of course, I didn‚Äôt. Whether I liked it or not, Mac was my friend. I couldn‚Äôt just leave him, and I knew‚Äîfucked up or not‚Äîhe‚Äôd never let me talk him into taking him to the hospital.

So I didn‚Äôt leave.¬†

And of course, it was a mistake.

\* \* \*

It took a lot longer for Mac to fall asleep than I‚Äôd originally anticipated. Having flatly refused to leave the tub, I‚Äôd instead gone and gotten his blanket and pillow from his bedroom, figuring if he absolutely had to spend the night in there, he could at least do it in relative comfort. I‚Äôd thought he‚Äôd be out like a light the second his head hit the pillow‚Äîwhat given how exhausted he‚Äôd looked‚Äîbut to my surprise (and eternal annoyance) he apparently hadn‚Äôt finished talking yet.¬†

‚ÄúShe was still there, you know,‚Äù he'd said, pulling me from a daze. From my position sitting propped against the far wall, I could just see his head peeking out above the rim of the tub. ‚ÄúAshley, I mean. Isn‚Äôt that crazy‚Äîthat someone can die like that and the world just keeps moving on, completely oblivious? She didn‚Äôt even look that bad. Hell, she could have been sleeping.‚Äù

To keep Mac from spiralling any further, I‚Äôd also gone ahead and confiscated Ashley‚Äôs laptop, telling myself I wasn‚Äôt going to go through it, that there was no way, but of course within half an hour I was balls-deep in their chat history. Turns out Mac had been using Ashley‚Äôs account to talk to whoever was on the other end, asking for advice, his requests growing more desperate and frenzied over time. The few responses he got back were mostly about Ashley, and where she now was, if she was okay. This last gave me pause. The only times I‚Äôd ever seen her was as a vaguely-human shape walking away from me, and a corpse. It was easy to forget she had once been a person, with a life, and friends, people who cared about her, and would likely miss her. If there had been any talk about the things Mac‚Äîa*nd I*‚Äîhad witnessed, it was all gone, the chat history‚Äîat least in this regard‚Äînow all but wiped clean. I had no idea why this would be the case, but seeing it irked me.¬†

Not knowing what else to do, I began methodically sifting through her search history, feeling strangely like a peeping tom as I scanned each site, mentally making a note of anything that jumped out as unusual. There was the typical stuff, for the most part. Social media sites, YouTube, a little light porn (*girls watch porn now, too?!*).

I must have nodded off at some point, because the next thing I remember was waking up in the dark.

I blinked and tried to look around me, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Evidently at some point while I slept the candles had gone out, turning my immediate environment into a black void.¬†

I was just thinking about laying my head back down when‚Äî

*‚ÄúNate!‚Äù*¬†

I shot up onto my elbows, knocking Ashley‚Äôs laptop onto the floor, having fallen asleep with it propped on my chest. ‚ÄúMac?‚Äù

I got up and shambled into the bathroom, finding Mac once again clutching his Barry Bonds bat. His eyes were wide and panicked, and there was spittle in each corner of his mouth. A thick sheen of sweat covered his entire body, glinting in the light from the candle. He looked rabid with terror.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúDO YOU SEE?!‚Äù He gestured past me at the open doorway.¬†

I turned and followed his gaze, staring now into a blackness as thick and dark as any I‚Äôd ever seen. It was more than darkness. It was the absence of light, a darkness so full and heavy that even the light from the candle couldn‚Äôt penetrate.

I said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there, Mac. You‚Äôre just having a bad dream.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here‚Ä¶‚Äù

I began to tell him to go back to sleep, that I was done with this babysitting shit, when suddenly I heard something from back out in the hallway behind me, and I turned, the hairs on the back of my neck suddenly standing upright.

I peered into the inky dark, my breath held, and for the faintest of moments thought I could just make out the outline of something standing there in the dark.

Something big.

I had time to think¬†*what the fuck*‚Äî

That was when Mac started screaming.

After 18 months working on myself, gym, self confidence work, not dating since my last 'situationship' 'cheated' on me - I met this girl on holiday in May. We slept together, had a walk the following day - it felt electric, and we kept in touch ever since. Started off casually, holiday romance tiktoks etc. I knew the long distance wasnt for me. Then she started sending like ""i think of you when i hear this song"" about our favourite band. We snapchatted daily. So I asked her out a couple of times, we stay 3 hours from each other, so part of me was like probs not ideal but I could maybe make it work. But she was always flakey, always would ""let me know"" or was doing something that day and never offered alternatives. 

I recall the peak of this and the limerence, being me asking her to go see an artist we both liked abroad, which she had suggested about our favourite band already - so i thought why not, could be fun. And by this point, I had the entire thing dreamed out - literally.. Me driving down, music blaring, picking her up, getting the plane over, getting into our hotel, going to the gig, sleeping together - so I asked, and she initially joked yes if its all inclusive. Madly infatuated, I said yes it would only be around ¬£200 anyway, and I was on top of the world, finally we're going to meet - then she asked, oh when is it; then said she couldn't manage. Then I said i just wanted to do something with her, hoping she'd over an alternative date, she said oh you're so cute. I threw my phone in disbelief. I knew right there and then this should've ended, but she lures me right back in with the flirty couples tiktoks once again. 

But a couple months ago, after continuing the same trend of all these tiktoks and flirty Insta reels - she agreed to meet. Reluctantly still I'd say, she said she'll try keep her diary clear for me coming down. But we did meet, middle of September, and it was the same movie as meeting on holiday. Mini golf, drinks and food, a gig where we kissed, slept together again, was dancing about in the middle of the main street in her city. Wow. Everything I've wanted for years with someone, finally. And by this point, I was mad limerent. It had been the constant hot and cold behaviour from her for 4 months now, sometimes ignoring me for hours - sometimes spamming me with tiktoks. But mostly she'd reply even if she was being short and not talkative. The date ideas she'd send, but never follow through on - so when it felt like a page was turning, i was so relieved. We even agreed to be exclusive when I was down.

We again, reluctantly agreed to meet a couple weeks later. Initially she said she'd be too tired on that day, but after I called her out of constantly saying that she said how about we just do something chill then. I said yes, because I will be hungover too anyway. But of course, I fall ill and have to cancel - and i hit my bed and said, thats the beginning of the end. I for some reason, knew that was the momentum of this gone. The entire week speaking about what we planned to do in bed, just to cancel. And funnily enough, right after this - she pulled away. I was down in her city the following week to see my friend, suggested meeting up for coffee, she said I'd let you know. Then ignored me all night and ended things the following day citing busyness, distance, her anxiety, not being ready to be a girlfriend, needing to focus on herself, it wasn't that serious cause we'd only met once. 

I've been so up and down all week, torn between fuck you for leading me on like this and I now realise I've been played - to right now, day 6 NC being so desperate to message and fix things. I know what I'm feeling is purely chemicals in my brain, I was so madly infatuated that I only found this person pretty. Genuinely, no one else turned me on at all. You see when things were going well, I hated some things and felt turned off - the fact she did bumps a couple of times out drinking, that she clearly had a history of getting about, her getting so drunk all the time, knowing the distance would be an issue, her flakiness,  - but when she pulled away, and more so ended things, I can make excuses for it all. And I completely dropped my morals and standards just because I am so infatuated with this person, and now that it has ended and I just had one/two short glimpses of the fantasy I built - I do not know how to cope in my life. But this happened with my first situationship, the exact same infatuation and it took months to get over - so I'm so scared. I'll never see this person again to be fair, and was constantly toyed with by my first after it ended. Genuinely, the thought of doing anything I did when I messaged her makes me sick. I couldn't even go to my football teams game today because of the things I know I'd chatted about when I was there.",2,1760811664.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1oa34at,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oa34at/adderall_rant/,Adderall Rant,"I‚Äôve gone back and forth on whether to share this. But if it helps even one person avoid what I went through, it‚Äôs worth it. I also just need to rant SO BADLY. I'm sorry for how long this is, but I've actually taken a lot out. Also I know these meds help a lot of people. This isn‚Äôt me saying they‚Äôre bad. They‚Äôre just not for everyone.

I‚Äôve been on Adderall since 2020. I had ADHD, I needed to focus, and it helped. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Over time, my dose crept up. By 2023, I was also on Wellbutrin. I didn‚Äôt know much about how they interacted. My psychiatrist didn‚Äôt say much either.

In January 2023, I was taking both. Then I started using Adderall less often for a while, until July 2024, when I decided to take it regularly again. I started law school that August.

The first semester started a mess. Because of the national Adderall shortage, I couldn‚Äôt get my prescription filled for almost two months. I crashed hard. I couldn‚Äôt focus, I felt sick all the time, and I was extremely depressed. Maybe some of it was psychological dependence, but I genuinely couldn‚Äôt function.

When I finally got my hands on it again in November, I started back at my full dose instead of easing onto it. Looking back, that was a huge mistake. My body couldn‚Äôt handle it. But I didn‚Äôt know that at the time. I was just desperate to succeed, and I didn't know how to other than to try and grind it out. In all the chaos that semester, I forgot to apply for accommodations (which was a huge mistake on my part). I also had this feeling of euphoria and impulsivity. Best way I can describe it is being so happy and joyful (for no reason) to the point where it would get uncomfortable and even painful.

I tried, but by the end of the semester, I was on academic probation.

Going into second semester, things got worse fast. My psychiatrist kept raising my dosage. By March, I was on 450 mg of Wellbutrin and 45 mg of Adderall a day. I know that‚Äôs not the highest dose in existence, but for me, I think it was too much.

I started losing my ability to think. My memory was shot. My speech didn‚Äôt make sense. My resting heart rate was so high that I couldn‚Äôt work out anymore. I stopped talking to people because I couldn‚Äôt form coherent sentences, and I was embarrassed.

I started developing paranoia. I thought people were watching me, talking about me, that everyone knew I was stupid. I thought professors were disgusted by me. I was dissociating constantly. Sometimes I forgot I was human. I‚Äôd have to look in the mirror just to remind myself that I existed.

In March, my housing fell apart (rat infestation, bad management, a week or two of couch-hopping and all-nighters. And that happened right before oral arguments and my appellate brief were due (if you‚Äôve been to law school, you know how bad that timing is). I was already falling apart mentally, and that just finished the job. I started hallucinating. I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôd see and hear rats in my dreams.

By finals, I think I had completely lost touch with reality. The best way I can describe it (as cheesy as it sounds) is like my real self was trapped somewhere deep inside, screaming to get out, but everything else (my thoughts, fears, daydreams) were circling like Dementors. Every time I tried to focus or study, I felt like I was having the life sucked from me. I'd also like to note, that I stopped feeling affected by caffeine & alcohol at this point. I was drinking entire energy drinks and not feeling anything. Before this, I did not drink caffeine. I have never had a cup of coffee in my life.

Somehow, I did a bit better that semester, but not enough to bring up my GPA. I was dismissed.

By this point, I thought I had an irreversible brain disorder. I thought cancer (I got an MRI) and then I thought maybe a degenerative brain disease. I was planning on figuring out how to live with it.

When I petitioned for readmission, I didn‚Äôt mention anything about my mental health or the medication. I didn‚Äôt understand what had happened to me. I just blamed it on housing problems and missed accommodations. The hearing went badly. They described me as ‚Äúdisoriented, confused, and contradictory.‚Äù At the time, I was offended. Now I know they were right, and I know why.

In July, after my petition was denied, I quit Adderall cold turkey. I didn‚Äôt even plan to quit forever. I just wanted to take a break before the next school year (I was still under the delusion that I would be returning to school). But after a few weeks, I started feeling normal again. I could think. I could speak clearly. I could drive without shaking.

It‚Äôs now been three months off the medication. I feel like a completely different person.

I found a new psychiatrist and psychologist. Both were surprised when they saw my old medication history. They said my combination of meds seemed unusual for my concerns. Both wrote letters saying my treatment was mismanaged. I have since found out that my previous psychiatrist had been billing my extremely short Telehealth calls as 30-minute sessions. He never once warning me about side effects or the risks of mixing Adderall and Wellbutrin. I did not know what to look out for. His notes don‚Äôt reflect anything I told him. He gaslighted me into thinking I needed the meds, that I‚Äôd be worse without them.

Now I know better. I‚Äôm appealing my school‚Äôs decision with this new evidence. But honestly, IDK if they are going to care.

I'm not sharing this for sympathy, I'm not even really sure WHY I'm sharing this. I am just so angry and upset. I feel desperate. I've never thought of doing anything other than law. If the school rejects my appeal, I'm done. The academic disqualification remains on my transcript, and not many law schools would admit me.

I thought stimulants were necessary for my success. I guess they might've ruined my life.",3,1760811646.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1oa2za7,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1oa2za7/day_90/,Day 90,"Hello! Finally decided to add to the community by providing an update to my journey that will perhaps encourage others to either quit, or motivate early quitters into continuing their journey. Here is my story. 

I got into vaping I think in January of 2024. I never thought I could ever get addicted to it, but surely enough I got sucked into the trap. I hated it, but the cravings were so intense that I found it extremely difficult to quit. I would try to quit vaping for a whole 14 months without success. 

I tried using nicotine gum to help quit but I was still unsuccessful. Eventually I found nicotine pouches, and I easily used those to quit vaping. And boy did I love those. 

I only really used the pouches for maybe 3 months, and I was so proud of myself for quitting vaping. In the back of my mind I knew I had to quit these eventually, but I slowly stopped caring. I was even more hooked on these than ever. 

WHAT MADE ME QUIT

Eventually I started having panic attacks, and I had no idea why. My anxiety was through the roof, I went into an intense depersonalization episode which would last months, and I genuinely thought I was going crazy and developing a severe mental illness. Everything made me have intense feelings of fear, and all sense of joy was gone. 

My eyes became more sensitive to light, and I started having weird visual distortions that are still kinda here currently, which threw me into even more distress. 

I stumbled upon this sub-Reddit back in July, which finally connected the dots for me. I quit the second after. 

MY QUITTING EXPERIENCE

I experienced absolutely no cravings at all at first. I had brain fog, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, DPDR, visual distortions, racing thoughts and just feeling on edge for probably 70 days in total. These feelings were so severe that I had no mental capacity to even think about nicotine. 

Caffeine was not helping. In fact it was making things a lot worse. So I had to force myself to slow down. Even a cup of coffee was enough to spark a panic attack.

The anxiety got way better around day 70 ish. I think after my brain realized that there really is no danger and that I‚Äôm safe, it began to slowly trust in my surroundings.

Now a-days things are a lot better. But I‚Äôm not 100% yet. The anxiety is much less severe, but I find I am still quite depressed and not as excited as I used to be. I expect another 90 days or so to really feel like my pre-nicotine self.

I only used nicotine for a year and a half, and consider myself one of the long haulers. So to have an experience like this with only a relatively brief introduction to nicotine and the pouches goes to show you how these pouches might not be as great of an alternative for us as the media makes it seem. 

It really looks like those of us who get the panic attacks are in for a roller coaster type experience when we quit. 

Those of you who are currently still struggling like myself 90 days out, I am with you. 

Sorry for the ramble. I hope this helps some of you who are early on into quitting and going through something similar. It has gotten better, and honestly I am grateful for this experience. I don‚Äôt think I would have quit nicotine if I didn‚Äôt go through all of this. 

 Cheers!

1oa2z1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1oa2z1p/bilingual_blitz_27_six_short_exercises_to_test/,Bilingual blitz [27] (six short exercises to test your Italian),"**THE RULES**

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I‚Äôll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there‚Äôs high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you‚Äôre not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won‚Äôt deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""Thank you all for coming here and for being here together with us in this moment of need""  
**A2)** ""I think he's heard his fair share of complaints""  
**A3)** ""Could this be the secret hiding place everyone is talking about?"" (after stumbling onto it)  

**B1)** ""Perch√© il piano riesca, √® necessario pensare proprio a tutto""  
**B2)** ""Non ha mai detto nessuno che tu dovessi fare per finta!""  
**B3)** ""Forza! Chi la dura la vince!""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 2 days (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here‚Äôs the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ‚â§4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ‚â•8  
**Natives**: ‚â•9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it‚Äôs very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I‚Äôd prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I‚Äôm collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Today I did a 10K walk, outdoors.

During my walk, after 5K, I paused and choose the option ‚ÄúResume Later‚Äù. After a cup of coffee I resumed. I paused again later because I was hiding from some heavy rain. Later I resumed and at the end, after more than 10K, I finished the activity and saved.

Unfortunately the activity did not upload to the GC App. I also tried uploading but got an error message.

Used some internet tools to try to fix the fit file, but no luck.

Strange thing is that this happened to me before. Also during a walk, also going inside and pausing (not sure though), and the same thing happened, corrupt file.

All other activities are normal.
