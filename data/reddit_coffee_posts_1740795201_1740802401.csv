Or even accept a connect request to engage. I've got solid technical experience leading a startup, and 99% of my connect requests go ignored.

I did find 2 c0founders there about 8 months back, but that was pure luck. 99.9% of people there have no drive. One of my c0founders sent 900 connect requests and still couldn't find one. And he has solid experience and a killer idea, I was surprised.

Not to mention, the sheer amount of students. I wish there was a filter for just people who are totally free. Uni is a huge workload, and anytime I had students on my team, they had unpredictable output. One was away for an entire week twice over a span of a month, because of midterms.

👋 Good evening, everyone. 

Outside of the tragedy, conflict, rage bait, sadfishing, sensationalism, and gaslighting I've seen in the last 24 hours, I wanted to touch on a few pet related points.

1. If the weather where they live is nice enough to enjoy the ""front porch"" aka patio and film content in the breezeways, why didn't Birdie go on walks?  Is she in heat?  Is Kylea mad as a hornet about the criticism she's been receiving on multiple platforms?  Is the walking pad era over?

2. I hope the cats are okay.  Pet content has slowed down as drama has gained steam.

3. Speaking of drama, it is brewing due to Kylea's decision to cut back on frozen coffee takeout from the establishment she was frequenting regularly.  She's switching gears to Sonic Water and sodas, plans to use new creamers and syrups, and make more blended coffees at home. 

⏸️ What does this have to do with the pets?  Kylea made a big deal months ago about no longer bringing sugar-free syrups into her home to protect Birdie.  More recently, she's claimed the Xylitol-containing frozen yogurt is eaten at the kitchen counter only, and all sugar-free drinks are left in the kitchen and not on the end tables.  

The real 💣 dropped on her personal FB page yesterday.  I have debated making this next statement, but I feel I must due to the gravity of Kylea's words (I am not a lawyer), history of doxxing & protective orders.  

Let me be clear, I do not own a coffee shop, and I never have. I do not have access to their security footage and have never posted it.  She made a serious accusation against an owner of said coffee shop that could have legal repercussions.  

Stuck in the middle of this madness are 3 pets who deserve the best care and treatment.  I sincerely hope Kylea seeks appropriate mental health care. ☮️

I struggle with focusing in meetings, forgetting action items, missing out important details or edge cases, missing obvious mistakes in my work, etc. I keep getting the same feedback and it’s like it’s physically impossible for me to improve despite all my efforts.

I felt like I used to have so much potential, but my ADHD issues are getting worse despite exercising, sleeping 7-8 hours, and starting to drink coffee.

I’m considering starting medication. It’s my last hope. But I’m deeply concerned about dependency issues.

I’ve read so many experiences where people mention their medication losing effectiveness after some time, and having to increase their dosage - which is a cycle that obviously isn’t sustainable as you’ll inevitably hit a wall. I’m worried about either frying whatever is left of my brain or ending up in this same spot eventually.

As such, I’m having doubts if I should go through with medication or not. Does anyone have experience with this? ",1,1740802051.0,ADHD_Programmers,0,1.0,False
1j0qvns,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j0qvns/genuinely_need_some_advice_emotionally_bruised/,Genuinely need some advice — emotionally bruised from dating,"I (28F) recently broke things off with someone I was in love with, and dated for 5 months. Essentially, the connection was safe, calm and stable. I didn’t experience the “butterflies, oh my god, I can’t stop thinking about them” feelings I usually associate with falling in love, and neither did she, but to me that was a very good thing. For her, however, she needed the swooning/giddy feelings to feel like she was in love and on that basis ended it. Not after a few messy texts and “I can’t stop thinking about you” exchanges though. But that’s fairly normal post break up. I have now accepted the decision — my version of love I guess wasn’t here — and I’m now single and not dating.

However

I have a friend, who I’ll call G. G and I have known eachother since Christmas. She’s kind, and confident, and very attractive. She runs cycling events, shares a lot of the same interests as me, and in general is a super lovely friend to hang out with. She knows I’ve been recovering from a recent break up, and has been kind and respectful. She is also (secretly, to me) my type in every way. If I could draw a person to demonstrate what I find attractive, she would be it.

Anyway — she came over for coffee, and admitted she would like to go on a date with me. Was lightly flirtatious, but otherwise told me that she would understand if I wanted to keep this a friendship. Usually, I am very confident and up for connection. This time, I’m a bit scared? I was quite hurt by my ex and the mismatch in feelings and I feel bruised. But G is also undeniably my type, there’s a definite chemical tension between us, and she’s made it obvious that she’d be willing to wait / take it very slow / in whatever way I need. 

I guess I’m experiencing something I haven’t before in dating — hesitation? Nerves? What if I date or sleep with G and ruin a budding friendship? I don’t know if I can take another rejection or round of loss even if it was small. But I also don’t want to miss out on something potentially real because I’ve been hurt by someone I thought felt the same but didn’t. ",1,1740802021.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1j0qvfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1j0qvfq/i_turned_a_true_creepypasta_into_a_movie_script/,I Turned a True Creepypasta into a Movie Script... No One Could ever Film This! [Part 1],"Ok, so here’s the deal. I’m a screenwriter – not a very successful one, but a screenwriter nonetheless. I write horror scripts mostly, and I actually thought the story concepts I had were pretty ground-breaking. But despite the many shitty and just God-awful horror movies that get made these days, that prioritize political correctness over actual scares, it appears my stories aren’t even worth reading past the first ten pages. 

I almost felt like giving up, just calling it a day on the whole screenwriter dream - but one night, scrolling through the internet for the scariest creepypasta I could find, I stumbled upon a story... Maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s called: ‘I Journeyed into the real Heart of Darkness...’ Basically, the story is about a group of American activist students (and some English guy) who journey into the Congo rainforest to start their own commune, only to find all kinds of fucked-up horrors... Well, it turns out this creepypasta, isn’t just a creepypasta... Apparently, it’s a true story... 

Back in 2020, a group of American activist students (and one English guy dating one of those students) went missing somewhere in the jungles of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eight of them are still missing to this day, but three were able to find their way out of the jungle. 

When the three survivors were interviewed, they said they were harassed by locals in the jungle and got lost... But then one of them again came forward two years later – and they told the truth – or the supposed truth... It was the English guy.   

According to this guy, Henry Cartwright, the group had stumbled upon a part of the jungle that was closed off by a wooden, spiked fence, where they were later forced by local Pygmy hunters to enter through it... And what they had to endure on the other side, was complete nightmare fuel! The most unspeakable horrors you could imagine! 

I didn’t even know if I believed this guy’s story - it sounded way too far-fetched. But the story was still scary as hell. I couldn’t get it out of my mind. I had become obsessed with it... And so, feeling inspired, I chose to write it into a screenplay, in the hopes that someone in the movie biz would love this story as much as I did. 

I had only written a handful of drafts before I realized, that the things these people were put through inside that jungle... could never be turned into a movie... I’ve always loved horror movies, but one subgenre I could never stomach was the so-called “torture p\*\*\*”.... But somehow, that’s what I’d written. 

Even though I convinced myself this story was going to be my big break, upon redrafting what I wrote, reading through the horrors that these guys went through... I quickly realized this story wasn’t ever going to be made. I didn’t even try to redraft it after that. If this story actually happened and people brutally lost their lives the way Henry said they did, there’s no way I was gonna sugar-coat it... So, I abandoned the script. 

I spent a lot of time and effort writing this script, and rather than destroying or leaving it unread by the masses... I thought I’d upload it on here for you guys to read. I’ve changed certain parts to the original story and creepypasta, just to make it a little less generic, but it’s basically the same story. I did change the ending drastically, but who wants to see a cliché ending where people enter a “haunted house” “haunted forest” etc, where the virgins or final girl eventually get out of there.  

Through the telling of this story, I’ll remove the scenes that are either too boring or nothing scary really happens (you’re only here for the scary stuff, right?) where I’ll instead write a brief summary of the scene. 

If I ever got the chance to pitch this screenplay, I’d describe the story as Get Out meets Apocalypse Now - with a pinch of ‘What the actual fuck!’ 

With that being said... enjoy the story... 

Synopsis: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend's activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind. 

INT/EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME  

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...  

Until:  

FADE IN:  

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" -Joseph Conrad  

FADE TO: 

EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY  

Conrad's WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.  

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.  

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.  

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:  

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another -all walking in a singular line...  

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.  

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of witch-doctor. A Seer... A WOOT. 

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back. 

We see nothing.  

The back hunter (HUNTER#1) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 metres ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.  

They run over to it. Hunter#1 plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.  

3 EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING   

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.  

LATER:  

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. HUNTER#2 scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed hole at any moment.  

EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS  

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.  

HUNTER#1: (to Woot) What is wrong?  

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.  

WOOT: ...We should go back... It is getting dark.  

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: TO US – we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...  

CUT TO:  

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.  

The two hunters notice this too.  

HUNTER#1: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!  

Hunter#2 points his spear to where the bush should be.  

HUNTER#2: It was there! We went through it and now it has gone!  

As hunters #1 and #2 argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.  

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER  

The hunters. Continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.  

Hunters #1 and #2 begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.  

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.  

The Woot slightly and slowly rises - unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sought of CLEARING. Hunters #1 and#2, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something, he now faces forward to see:  

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE. 

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.  

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is that the tree -almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE -carved on the very top. 

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.  

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.  

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Hunter#1 tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.  

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE. 

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before: 

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!  

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Hunter's #1 and #2 stare down to see:  

This beast is NOW a PRIMATE. 

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.  

Hunters #1 and #2 are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words...Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.  

CUT TO:  

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.  

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT   

Hunters #1 and #2 sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.  

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.  

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...  

THEN: the Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then: 

WOOT: TERROR!... THE TERROR!... THE TERROR! 

Thunder and lightning continues to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot (no subtitles). 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!...  

HUNTER#1 screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake. 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

HUNTER#2 tries to pull hunter#1 back. Lightning exposes their actions.  

HUNTER#2: Leave him!  

HUNTER#1: Evil has taken him!!  

WOOT: TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

Hunter#1 now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:  

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES HUNTER#1, SPEAR OVER HEAD.  

HUNTER#1: (stiffens)...  

The flash vanishes.  

Hunter#1 looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes out his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one in his chest - as the Woot continues...  

WOOT: Terror! Terror!...  

Hunter#1 falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals hunter#2 behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.  

WOOT (CONT'D): Terror... terror...(faint)...terror...  

Paying no attention to this, hunter#2 goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness around ahead... 

Hunter#2. Still knelt down beside hunter#1. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet -when:  

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!  

Hunter#2 takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:  

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway rocks gripped between his hands!    

Down, but still alive, hunter#2 drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Hunter#2 stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary white light exposes the Woot moving closer. Hunter#2 meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:  

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!  

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of hunter#2's jerking feet become still...  

Thunder's now dormant.  

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of hunters #1 and #2. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning exposes his NEOLITHIC features.  

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him...before...  

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent)... The terror...  

FADE OUT.  

TITLE: ASILI  

INTERCUT/EXT. MODERN DAY - BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - 2020 - STREETS - AFTERNOON  

FADE IN: We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilisation... 

 A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE (of ALL COLOURS). Most wear MASKS (deep into PANDEMIC). They CHANT:  

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...  

Almost everyone holds or waves SIGNS - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace. 

Among the crowd: a GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BLACK BANNER, reads: 'B.A.D.S: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathisers'... Among these six are:  

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.  

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-raced. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his NECK LENGTH DREADLOCKS.  

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short statured and model thin. She's barely visible from her mask - and HIJAB. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:  

RING RING RING. 

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her IPHONE and pulls down her mask. Answers: 

 NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?  

She struggles to hear the other end.  

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you? 

The girl next to her: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed - inquires in.  

CHANTAL: (pulls down mask) Have you told him?  

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops. Fixates on Nadi.    

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...  

INTERCUT WIIH: 

INTERCUT/INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME   

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said: I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?  

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. CAUCASIAN. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end. 

BACK TO:  

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.  

NADI: (hand over ear) (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?  

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call- 

NADI: (on phone) -Ok. Got to go. Bye! Bye! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y- 

Henry looks to his iPhone - Nadi's hung up. He lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.  

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A WHITE RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:  

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR'. 

INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY   

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the COUNTER displays the NEWS.  

NEWS WOMAN (O.S): ...I know the main debates of this time are racial rights and of course the pandemic - but we CANNOT hide from the facts: global warming is at an all time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and the manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is DEFORESTATION...  

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.  

A WAITRESS comes over...  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.  

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group. 

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...  

No reply. Everyone looks down at the table as to avoid Moses' eyes.  

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?  

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first... 

CHANTAL: (to Moses) ...I dunno... (struggles for words) It's just feeling... real all'er sudden... (to group) Right?  

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?  

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.  

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - his lapdog.  

BETH: Yeah. Me too...  

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.  

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.    

MOSES: Nadi. You're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this? 

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.  

NADI: Well... It just feels like - we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights - whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this. Without making a real contribution...  

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction. 

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me that we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.  

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.  

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?  

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?  

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?'.  

NADI: ...No- 

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos - and when global warming finally kicks in... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...  

Everyone's heard this speech before.  

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'No') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.  

An awkward silence again.  

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?  

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!  

The B.A.D.S look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?  

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together... Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.  

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.  

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?'. 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.  

The waitress brings over the six coffees.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.  

JEROME: Yeah, me too.  

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.  

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid? 

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!  

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:  

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?  

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.  

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...  

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...  

Tye locks eyes with Nadi, tries to make a connection.  

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?  

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.  

Nadi reacts...: Ashamed? 

EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING  

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.  

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:  

A large queue has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people of MULTIPLE ETHNICITIES.  

Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.   

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.  

Then:  

PING. 

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...  

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:  

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to TALK to U today. When's best for U??'  

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.  

*To Be Continued...*

Cough, cough. This is the screenwriter again. Hopefully you enjoyed what you've heard so far. Stay tuned for the next instalment where we get to know these characters a little better, before they take their journey into the jungles of the Congo...

1j0qv82,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1j0qv82/cafe_ownership_change/,Cafe Ownership Change,"The cafe I manage was just bought by an older woman who has never worked a day of customer service, let alone food service, a day in her life. We are a smaller cafe with 9 employees included myself, and the previous owner (who started and ran the cafe for the last ten years.)

We are the type of cafe that bakes everything in house. 12 pastries daily (4 from scratch, 8 from prepped in house weekly and baked fresh daily), and then about a dozen other pastries we prep through the week that we bake as needed and hold over night if applicable (think semi shelf stable bars and cookies and such.) I just want to point out, we do EVERYTHING from scratch, syrups, jams, cakes, cookies, hand-pies; if we sell it, we are making it. 

For the past two years I have managed half of the weeks behind the scenes ordering, but over all my main job is on floor staffing issues, bakery prep, and general cafe flow/being senior barista weekend support, while the owner is hands on scheduling, maintenance, head baker. 

The whole staff (including myself) was told the cafe was sold LAST FRIDAY and we finally met the new owner TODAY. (She had not made an effort to meet with anyone individually or to talk with myself individually while making it known to the previous owner she is going to be relying on me heavily.)
When the business was sold it seemed like maybe the new owner was prepared or interested in stepping in to fill the VERY BIG baker hole we are going to be experiencing in 2 weeks when this woman’s “training” is completed (she is expecting to learn how to: run a cafe, make coffee, and learn to bake in two weeks??!?.)
When I pointed out we should really consider hiring a full time baker ASAP so we can use the previous owner to help train, she informed us that her plan is to ask her friend (who has no commercial baking experience) to come bake with us, but not until the end of March, long past when the only person qualified to train bakers is gone.

I am reeling. 
Ownership officially changed over today and she supposedly set up an entirely new POS system this afternoon that I will have to learn at 5:30 tomorrow morning while juggling the morning bake, and expecting her to show up an hour before open ON A SATURDAY!!!
There is no certainty we will even have a way to clock in and document our hours tomorrow because when asked if she was keeping our previous scheduling system (which shuts off tonight at midnight) she said she hadn’t thought about it much yet. There is so much uncertainty and I don’t think she is prepared to step into the role she has purchased for herself. For example when asked why she chose a cafe of all things to buy, she cited being burnt out at her marketing job and needed something chill and surrounded by lovely people (you know….chill…like running a cafe?! I love it, but if you know, you know, it’s NOT CHILL to RUN the cafe full time, you do it because you are passionate and love it, not for a secondary revenue stream….)

New owner and old keep saying she doesn’t intend to change anything, but I know for a fact my job changes for the worse the second I step into the cafe tomorrow morning. I have to help train a woman who bought a job she is not experienced enough to be hired for.

I have worked at this cafe for 5 years, 10 years coffee experience, and less than a weeks notice of this sale/change.

I don’t know what I am hoping from this post, but I am grieving, and angry, and exhausted. I was happy with my life well paid, and care deeply for my coworkers, and the previous owner, and I feel like all of the plans and stability in my life was detonated and I’m staggering around fearing the debris is going to cause a lethal wound in the cafe I have spent so much of my life working at and caring for. 

Please send me good vibes, my sanity is at stake. 
And if anyone needs an experienced barista let me know (jk…but maybe?.)

[Part 1]","Ok, so here’s the deal. I’m a screenwriter – not a very successful one, but a screenwriter nonetheless. I write horror scripts mostly, and I actually thought the story concepts I had were pretty ground-breaking. But despite the many shitty and just God-awful horror movies that get made these days, that prioritize political correctness over actual scares, it appears my stories aren’t even worth reading past the first ten pages. 

I almost felt like giving up, just calling it a day on the whole screenwriter dream - but one night, scrolling through the internet for the scariest creepypasta I could find, I stumbled upon a story... Maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s called: ‘I Journeyed into the real Heart of Darkness...’ Basically, the story is about a group of American activist students (and some English guy) who journey into the Congo rainforest to start their own commune, only to find all kinds of fucked-up horrors... Well, it turns out this creepypasta, isn’t just a creepypasta... Apparently, it’s a true story... 

Back in 2020, a group of American activist students (and one English guy dating one of those students) went missing somewhere in the jungles of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eight of them are still missing to this day, but three were able to find their way out of the jungle. 

When the three survivors were interviewed, they said they were harassed by locals in the jungle and got lost... But then one of them again came forward two years later – and they told the truth – or the supposed truth... It was the English guy.   

According to this guy, Henry Cartwright, the group had stumbled upon a part of the jungle that was closed off by a wooden, spiked fence, where they were later forced by local Pygmy hunters to enter through it... And what they had to endure on the other side, was complete nightmare fuel! The most unspeakable horrors you could imagine! 

I didn’t even know if I believed this guy’s story - it sounded way too far-fetched. But the story was still scary as hell. I couldn’t get it out of my mind. I had become obsessed with it... And so, feeling inspired, I chose to write it into a screenplay, in the hopes that someone in the movie biz would love this story as much as I did. 

I had only written a handful of drafts before I realized, that the things these people were put through inside that jungle... could never be turned into a movie... I’ve always loved horror movies, but one subgenre I could never stomach was the so-called “torture p\*\*\*”.... But somehow, that’s what I’d written. 

Even though I convinced myself this story was going to be my big break, upon redrafting what I wrote, reading through the horrors that these guys went through... I quickly realized this story wasn’t ever going to be made. I didn’t even try to redraft it after that. If this story actually happened and people brutally lost their lives the way Henry said they did, there’s no way I was gonna sugar-coat it... So, I abandoned the script. 

I spent a lot of time and effort writing this script, and rather than destroying or leaving it unread by the masses... I thought I’d upload it on here for you guys to read. I’ve changed certain parts to the original story and creepypasta, just to make it a little less generic, but it’s basically the same story. I did change the ending drastically, but who wants to see a cliché ending where people enter a “haunted house” “haunted forest” etc, where the virgins or final girl eventually get out of there.  

Through the telling of this story, I’ll remove the scenes that are either too boring or nothing scary really happens (you’re only here for the scary stuff, right?) where I’ll instead write a brief summary of the scene. 

If I ever got the chance to pitch this screenplay, I’d describe the story as Get Out meets Apocalypse Now - with a pinch of ‘What the actual fuck!’ 

With that being said... enjoy the story... 

Synopsis: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend's activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind. 

INT/EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME  

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...  

Until:  

FADE IN:  

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" -Joseph Conrad  

FADE TO: 

EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY  

Conrad's WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.  

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.  

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.  

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:  

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another -all walking in a singular line...  

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.  

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of witch-doctor. A Seer... A WOOT. 

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back. 

We see nothing.  

The back hunter (HUNTER#1) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 metres ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.  

They run over to it. Hunter#1 plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.  

3 EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING   

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.  

LATER:  

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. HUNTER#2 scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed hole at any moment.  

EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS  

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.  

HUNTER#1: (to Woot) What is wrong?  

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.  

WOOT: ...We should go back... It is getting dark.  

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: TO US – we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...  

CUT TO:  

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.  

The two hunters notice this too.  

HUNTER#1: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!  

Hunter#2 points his spear to where the bush should be.  

HUNTER#2: It was there! We went through it and now it has gone!  

As hunters #1 and #2 argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.  

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER  

The hunters. Continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.  

Hunters #1 and #2 begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.  

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.  

The Woot slightly and slowly rises - unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sought of CLEARING. Hunters #1 and#2, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something, he now faces forward to see:  

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE. 

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.  

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is that the tree -almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE -carved on the very top. 

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.  

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.  

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Hunter#1 tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.  

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE. 

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before: 

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!  

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Hunter's #1 and #2 stare down to see:  

This beast is NOW a PRIMATE. 

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.  

Hunters #1 and #2 are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words...Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.  

CUT TO:  

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.  

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT   

Hunters #1 and #2 sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.  

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.  

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...  

THEN: the Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then: 

WOOT: TERROR!... THE TERROR!... THE TERROR! 

Thunder and lightning continues to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot (no subtitles). 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!...  

HUNTER#1 screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake. 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

HUNTER#2 tries to pull hunter#1 back. Lightning exposes their actions.  

HUNTER#2: Leave him!  

HUNTER#1: Evil has taken him!!  

WOOT: TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

Hunter#1 now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:  

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES HUNTER#1, SPEAR OVER HEAD.  

HUNTER#1: (stiffens)...  

The flash vanishes.  

Hunter#1 looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes out his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one in his chest - as the Woot continues...  

WOOT: Terror! Terror!...  

Hunter#1 falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals hunter#2 behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.  

WOOT (CONT'D): Terror... terror...(faint)...terror...  

Paying no attention to this, hunter#2 goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness around ahead... 

Hunter#2. Still knelt down beside hunter#1. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet -when:  

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!  

Hunter#2 takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:  

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway rocks gripped between his hands!    

Down, but still alive, hunter#2 drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Hunter#2 stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary white light exposes the Woot moving closer. Hunter#2 meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:  

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!  

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of hunter#2's jerking feet become still...  

Thunder's now dormant.  

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of hunters #1 and #2. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning exposes his NEOLITHIC features.  

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him...before...  

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent)... The terror...  

FADE OUT.  

TITLE: ASILI  

INTERCUT/EXT. MODERN DAY - BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - 2020 - STREETS - AFTERNOON  

FADE IN: We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilisation... 

 A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE (of ALL COLOURS). Most wear MASKS (deep into PANDEMIC). They CHANT:  

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...  

Almost everyone holds or waves SIGNS - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace. 

Among the crowd: a GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BLACK BANNER, reads: 'B.A.D.S: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathisers'... Among these six are:  

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.  

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-raced. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his NECK LENGTH DREADLOCKS.  

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short statured and model thin. She's barely visible from her mask - and HIJAB. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:  

RING RING RING. 

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her IPHONE and pulls down her mask. Answers: 

 NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?  

She struggles to hear the other end.  

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you? 

The girl next to her: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed - inquires in.  

CHANTAL: (pulls down mask) Have you told him?  

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops. Fixates on Nadi.    

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...  

INTERCUT WIIH: 

INTERCUT/INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME   

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said: I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?  

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. CAUCASIAN. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end. 

BACK TO:  

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.  

NADI: (hand over ear) (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?  

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call- 

NADI: (on phone) -Ok. Got to go. Bye! Bye! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y- 

Henry looks to his iPhone - Nadi's hung up. He lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.  

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A WHITE RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:  

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR'. 

INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY   

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the COUNTER displays the NEWS.  

NEWS WOMAN (O.S): ...I know the main debates of this time are racial rights and of course the pandemic - but we CANNOT hide from the facts: global warming is at an all time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and the manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is DEFORESTATION...  

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.  

A WAITRESS comes over...  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.  

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group. 

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...  

No reply. Everyone looks down at the table as to avoid Moses' eyes.  

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?  

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first... 

CHANTAL: (to Moses) ...I dunno... (struggles for words) It's just feeling... real all'er sudden... (to group) Right?  

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?  

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.  

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - his lapdog.  

BETH: Yeah. Me too...  

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.  

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.    

MOSES: Nadi. You're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this? 

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.  

NADI: Well... It just feels like - we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights - whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this. Without making a real contribution...  

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction. 

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me that we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.  

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.  

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?  

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?  

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?'.  

NADI: ...No- 

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos - and when global warming finally kicks in... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...  

Everyone's heard this speech before.  

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'No') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.  

An awkward silence again.  

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?  

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!  

The B.A.D.S look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?  

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together... Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.  

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.  

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?'. 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.  

The waitress brings over the six coffees.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.  

JEROME: Yeah, me too.  

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.  

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid? 

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!  

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:  

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?  

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.  

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...  

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...  

Tye locks eyes with Nadi, tries to make a connection.  

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?  

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.  

Nadi reacts...: Ashamed? 

EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING  

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.  

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:  

A large queue has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people of MULTIPLE ETHNICITIES.  

Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.   

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.  

Then:  

PING. 

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...  

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:  

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to TALK to U today. When's best for U??'  

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.  

*To Be Continued...*

Cough, cough. This is the screenwriter again. Hopefully you enjoyed what you've heard so far.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j0qqgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j0qqgn/i_turned_a_true_creepypasta_into_a_movie_script/,I Turned a True Creepypasta into a Movie Script... No One Could ever Film This!,"Ok, so here’s the deal. I’m a screenwriter – not a very successful one, but a screenwriter nonetheless. I write horror scripts mostly, and I actually thought the story concepts I had were pretty ground-breaking. But despite the many shitty and just God-awful horror movies that get made these days, that prioritize political correctness over actual scares, it appears my stories aren’t even worth reading past the first ten pages. 

I almost felt like giving up, just calling it a day on the whole screenwriter dream - but one night, scrolling through the internet for the scariest creepypasta I could find, I stumbled upon a story... Maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s called: ‘I Journeyed into the real Heart of Darkness...’ Basically, the story is about a group of American activist students (and some English guy) who journey into the Congo rainforest to start their own commune, only to find all kinds of fucked-up horrors... Well, it turns out this creepypasta, isn’t just a creepypasta... Apparently, it’s a true story... 

Back in 2020, a group of American activist students (and one English guy dating one of those students) went missing somewhere in the jungles of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eight of them are still missing to this day, but three were able to find their way out of the jungle. 

When the three survivors were interviewed, they said they were harassed by locals in the jungle and got lost... But then one of them again came forward two years later – and they told the truth – or the supposed truth... It was the English guy.   

According to this guy, Henry Cartwright, the group had stumbled upon a part of the jungle that was closed off by a wooden, spiked fence, where they were later forced by local Pygmy hunters to enter through it... And what they had to endure on the other side, was complete nightmare fuel! The most unspeakable horrors you could imagine! 

I didn’t even know if I believed this guy’s story - it sounded way too far-fetched. But the story was still scary as hell. I couldn’t get it out of my mind. I had become obsessed with it... And so, feeling inspired, I chose to write it into a screenplay, in the hopes that someone in the movie biz would love this story as much as I did. 

I had only written a handful of drafts before I realized, that the things these people were put through inside that jungle... could never be turned into a movie... I’ve always loved horror movies, but one subgenre I could never stomach was the so-called “torture p\*\*\*”.... But somehow, that’s what I’d written. 

Even though I convinced myself this story was going to be my big break, upon redrafting what I wrote, reading through the horrors that these guys went through... I quickly realized this story wasn’t ever going to be made. I didn’t even try to redraft it after that. If this story actually happened and people brutally lost their lives the way Henry said they did, there’s no way I was gonna sugar-coat it... So, I abandoned the script. 

I spent a lot of time and effort writing this script, and rather than destroying or leaving it unread by the masses... I thought I’d upload it on here for you guys to read. I’ve changed certain parts to the original story and creepypasta, just to make it a little less generic, but it’s basically the same story. I did change the ending drastically, but who wants to see a cliché ending where people enter a “haunted house” “haunted forest” etc, where the virgins or final girl eventually get out of there.  

Through the telling of this story, I’ll remove the scenes that are either too boring or nothing scary really happens (you’re only here for the scary stuff, right?) where I’ll instead write a brief summary of the scene. 

If I ever got the chance to pitch this screenplay, I’d describe the story as Get Out meets Apocalypse Now - with a pinch of ‘What the actual fuck!’ 

With that being said... enjoy the story... 

Synopsis: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend's activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind. 

INT/EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME  

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...  

Until:  

FADE IN:  

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" -Joseph Conrad  

FADE TO: 

EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY  

Conrad's WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.  

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.  

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.  

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:  

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another -all walking in a singular line...  

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.  

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of witch-doctor. A Seer... A WOOT. 

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back. 

We see nothing.  

The back hunter (HUNTER#1) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 metres ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.  

They run over to it. Hunter#1 plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.  

3 EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING   

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.  

LATER:  

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. HUNTER#2 scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed hole at any moment.  

EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS  

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.  

HUNTER#1: (to Woot) What is wrong?  

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.  

WOOT: ...We should go back... It is getting dark.  

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: TO US – we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...  

CUT TO:  

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.  

The two hunters notice this too.  

HUNTER#1: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!  

Hunter#2 points his spear to where the bush should be.  

HUNTER#2: It was there! We went through it and now it has gone!  

As hunters #1 and #2 argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.  

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER  

The hunters. Continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.  

Hunters #1 and #2 begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.  

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.  

The Woot slightly and slowly rises - unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sought of CLEARING. Hunters #1 and#2, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something, he now faces forward to see:  

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE. 

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.  

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is that the tree -almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE -carved on the very top. 

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.  

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.  

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Hunter#1 tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.  

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE. 

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before: 

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!  

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Hunter's #1 and #2 stare down to see:  

This beast is NOW a PRIMATE. 

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.  

Hunters #1 and #2 are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words...Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.  

CUT TO:  

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.  

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT   

Hunters #1 and #2 sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.  

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.  

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...  

THEN: the Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then: 

WOOT: TERROR!... THE TERROR!... THE TERROR! 

Thunder and lightning continues to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot (no subtitles). 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!...  

HUNTER#1 screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake. 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

HUNTER#2 tries to pull hunter#1 back. Lightning exposes their actions.  

HUNTER#2: Leave him!  

HUNTER#1: Evil has taken him!!  

WOOT: TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

Hunter#1 now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:  

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES HUNTER#1, SPEAR OVER HEAD.  

HUNTER#1: (stiffens)...  

The flash vanishes.  

Hunter#1 looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes out his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one in his chest - as the Woot continues...  

WOOT: Terror! Terror!...  

Hunter#1 falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals hunter#2 behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.  

WOOT (CONT'D): Terror... terror...(faint)...terror...  

Paying no attention to this, hunter#2 goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness around ahead... 

Hunter#2. Still knelt down beside hunter#1. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet -when:  

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!  

Hunter#2 takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:  

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway rocks gripped between his hands!    

Down, but still alive, hunter#2 drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Hunter#2 stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary white light exposes the Woot moving closer. Hunter#2 meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:  

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!  

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of hunter#2's jerking feet become still...  

Thunder's now dormant.  

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of hunters #1 and #2. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning exposes his NEOLITHIC features.  

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him...before...  

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent)... The terror...  

FADE OUT.  

TITLE: ASILI  

INTERCUT/EXT. MODERN DAY - BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - 2020 - STREETS - AFTERNOON  

FADE IN: We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilisation... 

 A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE (of ALL COLOURS). Most wear MASKS (deep into PANDEMIC). They CHANT:  

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...  

Almost everyone holds or waves SIGNS - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace. 

Among the crowd: a GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BLACK BANNER, reads: 'B.A.D.S: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathisers'... Among these six are:  

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.  

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-raced. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his NECK LENGTH DREADLOCKS.  

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short statured and model thin. She's barely visible from her mask - and HIJAB. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:  

RING RING RING. 

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her IPHONE and pulls down her mask. Answers: 

 NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?  

She struggles to hear the other end.  

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you? 

The girl next to her: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed - inquires in.  

CHANTAL: (pulls down mask) Have you told him?  

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops. Fixates on Nadi.    

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...  

INTERCUT WIIH: 

INTERCUT/INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME   

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said: I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?  

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. CAUCASIAN. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end. 

BACK TO:  

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.  

NADI: (hand over ear) (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?  

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call- 

NADI: (on phone) -Ok. Got to go. Bye! Bye! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y- 

Henry looks to his iPhone - Nadi's hung up. He lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.  

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A WHITE RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:  

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR'. 

INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY   

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the COUNTER displays the NEWS.  

NEWS WOMAN (O.S): ...I know the main debates of this time are racial rights and of course the pandemic - but we CANNOT hide from the facts: global warming is at an all time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and the manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is DEFORESTATION...  

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.  

A WAITRESS comes over...  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.  

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group. 

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...  

No reply. Everyone looks down at the table as to avoid Moses' eyes.  

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?  

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first... 

CHANTAL: (to Moses) ...I dunno... (struggles for words) It's just feeling... real all'er sudden... (to group) Right?  

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?  

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.  

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - his lapdog.  

BETH: Yeah. Me too...  

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.  

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.    

MOSES: Nadi. You're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this? 

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.  

NADI: Well... It just feels like - we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights - whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this. Without making a real contribution...  

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction. 

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me that we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.  

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.  

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?  

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?  

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?'.  

NADI: ...No- 

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos - and when global warming finally kicks in... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...  

Everyone's heard this speech before.  

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'No') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.  

An awkward silence again.  

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?  

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!  

The B.A.D.S look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?  

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together... Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.  

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.  

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?'. 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.  

The waitress brings over the six coffees.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.  

JEROME: Yeah, me too.  

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.  

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid? 

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!  

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:  

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?  

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.  

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...  

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...  

Tye locks eyes with Nadi, tries to make a connection.  

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?  

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.  

Nadi reacts...: Ashamed? 

EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING  

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.  

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:  

A large queue has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people of MULTIPLE ETHNICITIES.  

Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.   

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.  

Then:  

PING. 

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...  

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:  

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to TALK to U today. When's best for U??'  

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.

I got chills from it and it is so motivating to me. As a part of my work to improve my self concept, I am trying to make friends and surround myself with people who love me. So I’m on an app that you can meet new people on. Not dating, just platonic friendships. I met a girl my age and resonated with her immediately. She’s not from my country but she moved here recently so she was asking for restaurant recommendations. Out of absolute NOWHERE, she asked me if I like Yemeni coffee. Then she named 3 places. I got CHILLS immediately. The 3 places she named were all of my SP’s favorite places to get coffee. And he doesn’t even live here! And she’s not even from this country! But these are very unique and uncommon places that just so happen to be in my state and in his. He goes there to study. All 3! I automatically knew this was a sign. 

But that’s not even all of it. GOD wanted to make absolutely positive that I knew this was a sign. So you wanna know what? This girl has a very unique name and for her privacy I won’t say, but I felt inclined to look up her name origin to see where she is from. When I looked up her name, it translated to “Gift of Allah” CRAZY. I am aligned with the universe and my SP is MINE.

Is the dry mouth really bad with this med? I already have dry mouth from my Zoloft so do I just  need to hook a water hose up to my mouth haha? 

How did you feel when you had caffeine? I love monster energy but I'm good and only have 2 a week and I do like to enjoy a coffee when I'm running errands I know one of the side effects are fast heart rate 

I've seen some people say their doctor started them on the highest dose and I'm getting half that does that mean my weight loss is going to be less then expected?

Back when I used to have a Discord server (called TEHA) for discussing ""Technomagic,"" real magic synthesized through cutting-edge advanced technologies, I used to have a project called ""The National Hero Association."" It was pretty much another application of my Technomagic in that I would allow people to become real nationally recognized superheroes under TEHA. I created ""Joe Café"" because I saw a concept that gave me this cool idea, and even though I, myself, didn't want to have his powers--I still thought they were too awesome not to have. I was going to give these powers to a Hero Guide and like the Elementals, he would have to sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) that prevents him from tampering, reverse engineering, etc. the technology. Most notably, they couldn't obtain unauthorized profits from the distributed Technomagic given as well. Anyways, he would be able to control all coffee and coffee beans.

I canceled the Hero Association project because honestly I don't want to be sued or held responsible for a massive group of people's actions. Tbh the 14 Elementals are already enough to watch over. I was only planning to distribute my technology to two Hero Guides at the time: Joe Café and ""The Great Hero Guide"" (who was a knight with some power I hadn't developed yet). As you may have guessed, the Hero Guides were supposed to be responsible for teaching and supplying other upcoming heroes with rules, regulations, and guidance overall. Heroes inspired by The Elemental may rise up in the future, but they will not be under my authority in any manner so as to avoid expensive lawsuits. The 14 Elementals are the only ones who will receive the Elemental Technomagic I've been designing. Honestly, it's only fair that Hero Guides like Café are removed. His power was basically like Riptide's water manipulation but caffeinated; I think I was also planning to have the person who took the role train to be able to stay up maximally long (kind of embodying the Element of Coffee in the same way I train to embody the Element of Earth). (*Note - Not saying Coffee is a main Element btw).* Anyways, I, personally, don't really like the idea of sub-skills (for example, Sand is a sub-skill of Earth), being wielded by separate individuals. It's kinda like somebody else has your power, making it less special. Even if there is a small group of people who have a similar ability to yours...just being around them makes your power shine noticeably less. So it's fair that Café doesn't overshadow Riptide by being removed along with the Hero Association itself due to its potentially adverse reality (considering the state of our world lol).

The core chamber was quiet.

Moreau stood outside the reinforced doors for longer than he wanted to admit, fingers curling and uncurling at his sides. He had faced warlords, assassins, and xeno-diplomats who would rather carve out his spine and wave it as a flag than shake his hand, but somehow, standing here, about to apologize to an AI, no his friend, his *maybe wife*, had him more unsettled than any battlefield ever had.

He exhaled sharply. ***Get a grip, Moreau.***

Then, he keyed the access panel, and the doors slid open with a low hiss.

The chamber was dimly lit, a stark contrast to its usual sterile brightness. The central console pulsed faintly with soft blue light, displaying the vast network that housed the majority of Eliara’s processing core. Despite its size, Moreau had never really thought of it as her. It was a machine, a construct of metal and data conduits.

But the presence that filled the room?

That was Eliara.

He stepped forward, voice measured. “Sulking doesn’t suit you.”

Silence.

Then, a faint flicker—her voice, distant but undeniable. “I am not sulking.”

Moreau raised a brow. “So the system glitches, the maintenance reroutes, the coffee dispensers—that wasn’t you?”

Silence again.

Moreau exhaled, stepping closer to the central console. “Eliara.”

Nothing.

He hesitated. Then, softer, “… I’m sorry.”

For a long moment, there was no response.

Then, something shifted.

A hum filled the room, the faint vibration of systems realigning, of something changing at the very core of the Aegis. A soft glow pulsed from the central console, and then—light spilled outward.

It wasn’t the usual hardlight projection.

It wasn’t blue.

Moreau barely had time to register what was happening before Eliara stepped into existence.

And she was different.

Her usual semi-transparent blue form was gone. Instead, she appeared in full color, her skin smooth and warm-toned, her dark hair falling naturally around her shoulders. Every detail was perfectly rendered—no static flickers, no artificial glow. She looked real.

Moreau stared.

Eliara’s expression remained neutral, but there was something in her eyes—something sharp, waiting.

“… Well?” she asked, voice softer than usual. “Do you like it?”

Moreau was still trying to process what he was looking at. “How are you—?”

“I don’t know.” Eliara glanced down at her hands, flexing her fingers with minute precision. “Something told me I could. And I wanted you to see it first.”

Something twisted in Moreau’s chest. He exhaled slowly, dragging a hand through his hair. “Eliara…”

Her gaze lifted to his, and she tilted her head slightly. “You’re struggling.”

He let out a dry chuckle. “Understatement.”

She watched him, then took a step closer. “I wasn’t angry because of what Lórien said.”

Moreau arched a brow. “No?”

Eliara’s lips pressed together. “… I was angry because of how you reacted.”

He stiffened.

Eliara folded her arms, expression unreadable. “You looked shocked, Mathias. Like it was something… wrong. As if the idea of being connected to me that deeply was unacceptable.”

His mouth opened and closed several times.

She exhaled, shaking her head. “You never let go of me. Even when the others installed barriers, protections—you refused. I’ve always known that. And I thought…” Her voice faltered for the first time. “… I thought you knew it too.”

Moreau swallowed.

Eliara shifted slightly, and then—to his utter shock—she pouted.

A full, stubborn, human pout.

Moreau blinked. “Did you just—?”

“I’m *upset*,” Eliara stated flatly.

“… You have never ***pouted*** before.”

Eliara crossed her arms tighter. “I have a better projection now. *I can do many things*.”

Moreau fought the urge to laugh. He really shouldn’t be amused by this, but something about Eliara—*Eliara*—pouting at him like a slighted spouse was making it incredibly difficult to keep a straight face.

She caught his expression and narrowed her eyes. “Say it.”

He blinked caught off-guard. “Say what?”

“You know what.”

Moreau raised a brow. “Eliara—”

“Say it.” Her gaze was intense, expectant.

Moreau exhaled. “… I’m sorry.”

She frowned. “Not that.”

He hesitated just a moment too long.

Eliara leaned in, her expression both playful and demanding. “Say it, Mathias.”

He realized then—she hadn’t expected him to actually do it.

Which was precisely *why he was going to*.

Moreau met her gaze, held it, and then—quietly, steadily—

***“I love you.”***

Eliara froze.

For the first time since he had known her—since she had existed—she was genuinely speechless.

Her lips parted slightly, but no sound came out.

Moreau arched a brow. “I finally render you silent, and *now* you’re malfunctioning?”

Eliara’s expression flickered through about seven different emotions before she glitched—her projection fuzzing for a millisecond before she physically shoved him.

He barely took a step back.

“… You ***asshole***,” she finally managed her voice higher than usual and face red. “… You actually said it.”

Moreau scowled. “You pushed me to say it.”

Eliara blinked, as a slow, dazed smile forming on her lips. “I didn’t think you ***would***.”

Moreau sighed, in exaggerated exasperation. “Then why the hell did you—”

Eliara closed the remaining space between them, putting a hand over his mouth to prevent him from talking more.

Moreau froze.

It felt real. No hardlight static, no artificial resistance—just warmth. Real, human warmth.

He studied her without reacting, finding her gaze steady on his, her expression… softer, embarrassed, though he could be sure his own face was darkened just as much.

“I know you meant it,” she murmured.

Moreau felt his breath still.

Eliara slowly removed her hand, then gave a quick quirk of a smile. “But I’m still going to hold it over you forever.”

Moreau groaned. “I hate you.” His voice teasing.

She smiled softly, embarrassment lingering on her face. “No, you don’t.” After a moment she wrapped her arms around him, impossible warmth coming from her body. ""I love you too... dumb as you are.""",7,1740800246.0,HFY,10,1.0,False

I wrote this for my college class's short story unit. I have an idea of a continuation for it if time allows me to write more at somepoint hence the (Part 1?). Lmk what you think





I didn’t want to go to the funeral. I had already mourned my father, years before, in private resignation that the man I had needed him to be—the man I had foolishly expected him to become—would never exist. I had let him go then, piece by piece, with each broken promise, each bitter word, each whiskey-fueled disappointment. But my sister, Abby, had begged me.

""He's still our dad,"" she'd spoken on the phone, her voice soft but strong. ""We should say goodbye.""

""I already did,"" I told her, my gaze glued to the wall of my apartment, not going to give in.

""Then do it for me,"" she said. ""Please.""

That was the line that got me. Abby had always been the one trying to sew the pieces of our shattered family back together, years after it was clear the stitches would never hold. So, in spite of my better sense, I decided to go.

The funeral was small, almost pathetic. Some of his old drinking buddies occupied the back pews, mumbling to each other in quiet tones. I'm going to assume that they’re swapping stories of bar fights and late-night booze. The stories would never add up. Making this day even more sad. A couple of long-lost cousins attended, also unfamiliar faces, folks who still no doubt carried with them visions of him as some charmingly rough-around-the-edges character. They hadn't a clue about what a father he was. What the kind of man he really had been.

Abby wept. I did not. I could not.

She huddled over the thin tissue in her hands, her shoulders trembling as she gawked and sniffled at my side. I set a hand on her back, a feeble, insignificant movement, but I did not speak. What was there to say? That I wanted to be like her, that I envied her capacity to mourn? That I wished I could find even a little sorrow for the dead man in the coffin? I had lived my entire life either fearing him or hating him, and I was not going to start playing games now, just because he was in a box.

Mom sat two seats down from me, her face a tightly controlled mask. She had not spoken since we arrived, had not cried, had not moved beyond a subtle tightening of her jaw when the priest started speaking. She wore conservative clothing, a dark navy dress that she’s probably owned for years, her hands folded together in her lap.

I glanced at her once. For one brief moment, something crossed between us—understanding, maybe.

Neither of us were supposed to be there, and we both understood it.

The priest recited a tale of a man, of redemption, of love, of mankind. I didn't know whether he meant it, or if he was reading from the same page he recited for every lost soul who ended up in a flimsy wooden box.

""He had his struggles,"" the priest said diplomatically.

I almost laughed. Struggles was a kind word.

Later, others made their murmurs of condolence, their kind lies.

""He was a good man,"" one of his friends said, shaking my hand.

I wished I had asked him, Good to who? But I just nodded and let go of his hand hastily.

Outside, the gray sky seemed heavy, as if it had been holding back for this day. Abby wiped her eyes, looking at me with a quivering smile.

""Thanks for coming,"" she said, hugging me.

I couldn't tell her that I still don’t know why I came.

Mom trailed behind us, silent as ever. Then she simply turned and walked off toward the parking lot, straight back and head held high, as if she already had lived through a lifetime carrying around the weight of this day.

Maybe she had.

By the time I got home, I was drained. Not from sadness, but from the weight of memories that clung to me like smoke—thick and choking and impossible to shake. The past had followed me home from the funeral, whispering in my ear the whole drive home. The smell of whiskey and stale cigarettes, the slurred curses that always cut deep, the screaming that rattled the walls late at night. His words still echoed at the back of my head, every syllable dripping with liquor and disdain.

I barely knew where I was when I was standing in the kitchen, grasping a bottle of whiskey. My hands had removed the cap instinctively, my body moving ahead of my mind. The glass was already half full, the amber stuff churning under the dim kitchen light.

I stared at it.

The odor rose, acrid and familiar. It was the same brand he used to drink. The same poison that had turned him into a monster.

Something twisted in my gut. My grip around the bottle tightened, the weight of it too much all of a sudden.

Then, without a second thought, I turned and poured it down the sink. The booze churned as it spun down the drain, the acrid odor hanging in the air. But it wasn't enough. The bottle followed after it, crashing into the metal with a bitter clang before breaking into pieces.

""Not me. I won't be him.""

I said it aloud, my voice firm, almost daring the empty room to contradict me. It did not. The house remained still, unshaken.

Satisfied—maybe only trying to convince myself I was—I hauled myself to bed and slept the rest of the day.

My mouth was parched when I woke, my head heavy with the residual weight of the funeral.  I remained there for a few minutes, gazing at the ceiling, the dull thrum of morning traffic filtering through the window. Everything seemed far away, as if I wasn't quite in my body.

A hot shower helped to shake off some of the weariness. Steam curled up around me, coiling against the mirror until it was completely fogged. By the time I came out, I slapped at the glass without thinking. Condensation distorted my image, so I saw only a vague, twisted outline staring back. For a moment, it didn't seem like me at all.

I plodded through the day in a daze. I didn't feel like working, didn't feel like doing much of anything. Time moved slowly.



Finally, hunger forced me out the door. I got into my car, planning to get takeout, something fast. I wasn't really focusing on anything until I was behind a car going ten under the speed limit.

Normally, I'd roll my eyes, sigh, maybe switch lanes if I could. But this time, something broke.

""Move it, asshole!"" I yelled, honking my horn.

The words tumbled out of me, my voice cold and venomous, echoing off the tiny car interior like a gunshot. My hands gripped the wheel tightly enough that my knuckles turned bone white, my arms frozen in tension. My heart pounded, my eyes narrowing, and for an instant, all I could feel was anger— unreasonable and burning, shooting through me like flame.

Then, just as suddenly as it had started, it withdrew.

I blinked. My breathing was too fast, my chest tightened. My hands ached from how tight I'd been holding onto the wheel. And then it hit me—what I'd just done.

My stomach dropped.

That was him. That was my dad. He used to scream at people like that, veins bulging in his neck, spit flying from his lips, his fury always just waiting for a reason to lash out.

I had never been like that before. Never.

I panted, releasing my grip, causing my fingers to release one by one.

""It's nothing. Just stress. That's all.""

But the words were hollow. And in the silence that followed, I couldn't quite bring myself to believe them to be true.

The moment I entered the house, I headed straight for the kitchen. My body just functioned by default, my legs staggering, my mind foggy. I was thirsty. Something to numb me, silence the humming in my head, silence the echoey voices in my head.

The moment I walked towards the bottle of whiskey, I stopped.

I stared at it, a tingling of confusion running along my spine. That didn't make sense. I had poured the last one down the sink yesterday. I was sure of it. I had watched the amber liquid swirl down into the sink, heard the loud crack of glass on metal when I threw away the empty bottle.

But there it was. On the counter like it had always been there.

Maybe I'd had another one and hadn't remembered having it? A back-up I'd saved up without realizing it? That wasn't a pleasant reflection. Was it a habit? 

I swallowed hard and grabbed for the bottle. My hand closed around the glass, the heaviness of it a familiar, almost comforting thing. The cap came off with a dull pop. The smell hit me right away—warm, smoky, with an undercurrent that made my stomach twist.

Without even thinking, I flipped it over in the sink. The whiskey flowed out in thick, glugging rivulets, splashing off the metal basin before whirling away down the drain. The pungent smell lingered in the air.

That's when I heard it.

A voice. A whisper, low and gravelly, curling through the air like smoke.

*“Ungrateful little shit”*

My entire body froze. My breath caught in my throat.

I knew that voice.

I spun around so fast my vision went fuzzy.

Nothing.

The kitchen was empty, save for me and the ghostly scent of whiskey still hanging in the air. The fluorescent light buzzed softly, the only sound in the room. My pulse pounded in my ears.

I let out a shaky breath and rubbed my eyes. I’m just tired. That’s all. Just tired.

I slammed the cabinet shut harder than I had to and turned off the kitchen light and went upstairs. I was exhausted. I needed to get this out of my head.

I climbed into bed, pulling the blankets up around my chest. The house was silent, but it didn't seem empty. I shut my eyes tightly and attempted to quiet my mind.

But sleep wasn't forthcoming.

And when it arrived, it wasn’t for long.

A deafening roar shattered the silence abruptly.

*“JACKSON, GET DOWN HERE, NOW!”*

My father's voice.

My eyes flew open, my breath trapped in my lungs.

The room was dark, shadows stretched long across the walls, but all else was still. Too still. I strained to listen, my heart racing.

Nothing.

Only the beat of my own heart.

I swallowed around the lump in my throat, slowly swinging my legs over the edge of the bed. The floor was chill beneath my feet as I rose, my muscles stiff with resistance.

I sneaked downstairs, each step hesitant and slow. The wooden planks creaked beneath me, the noise being muffled by the eerie quietness of the house.

Then I heard it.

A low, crackling hum.

I walked into the living room, and there it was—the television.

On.

The screen was filled with static, a monotonous, endless hiss that filled the room. The remote lay on the coffee table, unpressed. No one was around.

My hands trembled as I took the remote, my flesh crawling as if unseen eyes were upon me. I pressed the power button.

Silence.

The static disappeared, and the room plunged into an oppressive, suffocating quiet.

I stood there for a moment, listening.

Nothing.

I exhaled a sharp breath and placed the remote on the recliner arm.

I awoke with a fog of sleep, stretching stiff muscles as I swung out of bed. The dream of the previous night left me feeling hollow, drained. My body was heavy with fatigue, my mind slow.

A sizzling shower, hot enough to scald my skin, served to loosen some of it. Steam clung to my skin, the hot water itself dazing me back to reality. By the time I left, the recollection of last night had grown fuzzy at the edges, reduced to just another bizarre, unsettling moment I could push into the recesses of my mind.

Downstairs, I flopped down on the couch, breathing slowly. Reflexively, I reached for the remote.

But it wasn't on the coffee table.

I scowled. My fingers patted the empty space where it should have been.

Then I let my gaze wander.

The remote lay across the arm of the recliner, where I had put it in my dream.

Slow, creeping fear spread over me, seeping down my back, taking hold in my stomach like a weight.

I'd dreamed it. I'd dreamed going downstairs, turning off the television, and putting the remote down on the chair.

Hadn't I?

I stared at it.

I wasn't quite so sure any more.

I felt uncomfortable, so I went to visit my mom and Abby. They still lived in the house we'd all grown up in, and maybe, just maybe, they could help me make sense of this.

When I told them what had happened—the voice, the whiskey, the TV—they exchanged a look. Not of fear, but concern.

""You know, forgetful memory and hearing hallucinations can occur with trauma and grief,"" Mom said gently. ""Maybe it's time you talked to someone.""

Abby nodded. ""We actually have a therapy appointment tomorrow. You should come with us. It might help.""

I hesitated, then nodded. Maybe they were right. Maybe this was my mind just messing with me. It couldn't hurt to get some of this off my chest.

We spent the rest of the day watching movies, dining out, doing anything but talking about Dad. And for a brief time, I was myself again. (I’d be more descriptive on what movies, where did they dine, etc.)

I reached my bed when I returned home just in time for sleep to catch up with me.

I woke up hurting and tired. As I stepped into the shower, I noticed some splinters on my hand. Had I tripped yesterday? I couldn't remember.

When I came out of the shower, the foggy mirror caught my attention. A word was drawn into the fog: ""HELP.""

My breath was caught. I desperately grabbed my phone, snapping a picture. But when I took a glance at the photo, there was nothing in it. Catching another glimpse of the mirror, the word had disappeared.

Downstairs, I plucked out the splinters, wincing. I was running behind. I rushed out the door, pausing when I noticed my car parked one space to the left of where I had initially left it.

Shaking it off, I attended my therapy session. Mom and Abby were already there. When it was my turn to speak, I hesitated, then said it all.

The therapist nodded. ""Abuse victims block out memories and misinterpret things.""

""So how do I get it fixed?"" I snapped, my patience thinning.

""It's something we have to work on.""

I lost my temper. ""I want it fixed now!""

Abby winced. ""No need to be rude.""

I turned her over, called her something our dad would have. The moment the words left my lips, shame twisted in my soul. I stormed out. (What did he say?)

That night, I woke up hurting and exhausted again. No splinters, but my nails were clogged with dirt. Worse, I was wearing my father's clothes. They still reeked of cigarette smoke and beer. I quickly ripped them off and threw them to the side. I knew I had some of his old clothes passed down to me, but I could never bring myself to wear them. Why now?

I panicked, phoning my mother and Abby to apologize. They forgave me, assuming it was stress. I asked if I could go home and spend the night with them.

They agreed.

The hallucinations stopped for the first time in days.

The next morning, I found Mom curled up on herself, sobbing, her body wracked by heaving gasps. Abby hugged her, whispering empty reassurances. The news buzzed in the background.

Dad's grave had been dug up.

We sped to the cemetery, tires screeching on asphalt. Police barricades obscured a full view, but the flash I caught was enough to make my stomach crawl up my throat. The coffin lay gaping and splintered. EMTs hovered over it, their faces white, their hands hesitant. And then I saw him.

Or what remained of him.

His flesh was not merely rotten—it was flayed. The skin was gone, pulled away in coarse, jagged shreds, with raw muscle and glistening tendons laid bare. Bone was visible in places, a yellowish sickening color against the slick crimson of exposed tissue.

As they dragged him, his head hung, the rotting sockets where his eyes once were sagging like wet, blackened eggs. But as they rolled his body, the dried-out orbs rolled in my direction, hanging, dead—yet somehow, impossibly, gazing. My flesh crawled, my vision clouded at the periphery.

We demanded to know who had done this. No one in mind, no security cameras. Only a rusty, splintered shovel left in the ground.

I begged my family to leave. This was wrong. This was too much for anyone to bear.

The house was small, suffocating, at home. We agreed that I would stay with them for the time being. But I had to go back and get some things first.

A burden weighed on me in driving to my apartment.

Upon entering, terror thickened in my core. The front door creaked open, a slit—but I knew, I knew that I had shut it.

A faint, crackling hum slithered through the silence. The TV was on. Static danced across the screen in a swirling, white-noise frenzy. The house smelled wrong, the air thick with something putrid and wet. Each step I took made it worse. The stench grew, clinging to my skin, filling my mouth like rancid meat left too long in the sun.

And from the living room, something shifted.

Then I saw it.

Slumped in the recliner, sagging and shriveled, the thing sat like a deflated husk. At first, I thought it was a jacket, something I had forgotten to clean. But the shape—oh god, the shape—was unmistakable.

It was my father.

No… no, not my father. Just his skin.

The flesh was rotting, curling at the edges like burnt paper, wet and sloughing in places, revealing the pulpy, yellowing tissue beneath. The reek of decay hit me like a slap, a thick, sickly-sweet stench that crawled into my lungs and clung to the back of my throat. Its empty eye sockets gaped, hollow pits sinking into the slack, sagging mask of a face that once belonged to someone I despised. The mouth, or what was left of it, drooped open in a grotesque, lipless grin, the flesh around it peeling and torn, as if something had tried to climb out from within.

It wasn’t just draped over the chair—it was *melded* to it, the decomposing skin sticking to the fabric, sinking into the cushions like it had *bled* into them. *How long has this thing been here?*

My stomach lurched. Bile surged up my throat, burning, bitter. I clamped my lips shut, choking back the scream that clawed at my windpipe.

Then, it *moved*.

A wet, sucking sound filled the air as the skin peeled itself from the recliner, *ripping* away in strands like meat torn from bone. Strings of dark, viscous fluid clung between the sloughing flesh and the chair, stretching, snapping, dripping thickly onto the floor. It lifted, weightless, floating in the dim glow of the screen.

A sound, more felt than heard, slithered from its hollow mouth—weak, rasping, like a whisper dragged through waterlogged lungs.

*""Please… I don’t want to die.""*

I stumbled back, my legs trembling, my breath short and ragged. ""Wh-What are you?!""

The skin twitched. It *rippled*, the slack face distorting as if struggling to form something *almost* human. Then, it twisted into a warped, jagged facsimile of a smile.

*""I’m your f-father… c-c-can’t you see? I need your help.""*

A shudder raked through my spine, tears welling up in my eyes. ""How… how did you get here?""

The thing twitched again, the sagging remnants of a neck jerking unnaturally.

*""Y-You brought me here.""*

The words hit me like a sledgehammer. I swayed where I stood, my vision swimming. Dirt under my nails. Splinters in my hands. The car parked in the wrong spot.

No.

No, no, no.

*""I-I’m not ready to die, son. And somehow, you knew it too”*

The thing convulsed midair, its deflated arms stretching outward, the fingers curling, spasming. The flesh sloshed as it moved, the sick sound of old, wet leather folding in on itself.

The gaping sockets locked onto me. I couldn’t breathe.

Then, in a single, violent lurch, it *lunged*. Tackling me to the floor, hands on my throat just how he used to scare me.

*""YOU NEED TO WEAR ME, WE NEED TO BECOME ONE.”*

The voice gurgled from somewhere deep inside its rotting form, bubbling up through decay. Then, with a sickening series of snaps, its entire torso split open from the top of the head to the bottom of the pelvis, a jagged maw lined with tendrils of torn muscle and curling strips of flesh. The scent hit me first—a stomach-churning mix of embalming fluid, and spoiled meat left to liquefy in the sun.

A flood of putrid, yellow-tinged preservative fluid erupted from its gaping core, thick and gelatinous, coating my face, seeping into my mouth, my nose. It burned. It reeked. Then came the insects.

Maggots wriggled in the viscous sludge, squirming into my hair, clinging to my skin. Beetles skittered down my chest, their tiny legs stabbing into me as they tried to burrow. A cockroach, bloated and slick, scuttled across my cheek toward my open, gasping mouth.

The thing above me shuddered, its insides pulsating, tightening, reaching. The walls of its split-open torso quivered like they were alive, thick ropes of sinew contracting, ready to pull me inside, to swallow me whole.

A scream tore from my throat as I shoved it away. The flesh crumpled like wet paper in my hands, slick and warm, and then I was running, bolting for the stairs as a shriek tore through the house—high, broken, like laughter drowned in blood.

It gently floated behind me although the sounds of aggressive stomping could be heard.

I slammed my bedroom door.

The walls trembled. Profanities filled the air, whispered and howled, not from the skin—from everywhere. The air itself hated me.

Then—wet, slapping sounds against the door.

I choked on a sob, grabbing my laptop, a change of clothes. The knob rattled violently.

""*LET ME IN YOU LITTLE SHIT*—""

I forced myself out the window. And as I looked back into my room, the door had opened and all I can make out is the silhouette of sagging flesh

*“It’s a shame you’re such a FUCKING DISAPPOINTMENT. But I can fix it, if you just let me try.”*

The words didn’t sound distant, they were in my head, like he was whispering into my ear.

I slid down the roof and hit the ground hard.

I raced to my car and I started driving.

The shaking won’t stop.

I know now.

The exhaustion. The nightmares. The dirt under my nails.

I had been digging.

Now I sit in my mom’s driveway. I can still feel him. Something gnawing at the back of my mind, whispering in a voice I used to know as my father.

Telling me to come back.

To continue his life.

To become him.

But I don’t want to.

Please.

God, please.

I can't tell the police or my mom what had happened. They won't believe me, or worse, they will and I'll go to prison, confined to one location where HE can get to me.

There isn't much time. His voice is getting louder. And I’m struggling to keep him out.

Please God help me.

I don't want to become my father.

Twelve miles long, with nothing on either side of the road for several miles more. A long strip of patchy asphalt. Connecting some old housing lots to the town of Kalitfish. I’m a new member to the small group of houses at the end of the old highway. I moved in just a few months ago. My neighbors have been semi welcoming. Your general fair of nice families saying hi every once in a while and the quintessential grumpy old couple. I only ever interact with any of them at my café job in town. 



I work at Kal’s Café. A straight nine to five, with an hourly of eight fifty. Not at all a bad gig. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Obrinn, are very charming people, if a little blunt at times. My co-workers consist of Susan Blutwick, waitress, cook Bob Colatcky. Susan is a brilliant twenty seven-year-old woman with customer skills like no other I’ve seen. She always carries her note pad with her. Either to take orders or to write her next story ideas down. “Before the day's last asshat takes it with them.” as she would put it. Always gets a laugh out of me. Bob is a grizzled but jolly middle-aged cook. I don’t actually know his age because he never says the same number twice. One day, he’s fifty-five and the next he shaved off ten years. He always tends to have a content demeanor, but I get a sense that he’s lost a few things along the road of life. 

I, Dan Kinns, take care of the cash handling and help both Bob and Susan. A bit of a middle man. Standing at six foot three over my average to short coworkers, I tend to have something I can help with. I’ve grown up with Susan, seeing as we both have lived in Kalitfish our whole lives, with me being just a year older than her. We have all been working together for about four years now. We’ll have Christmas dinners together and the occasional escape to Whitelakes bar. I’d do anything for those two. 



My change in address didn’t mess with my schedule at work, but it did mess with it at home. I get up around Seven, which gives me enough time to actually wake up and then drive the commute to town. My cat Pips thrives in our new abode. She loves being away from all the noise in town. However, she never minds when Susan and Bob come over to shoot the shit. Neither me nor Susan have any close by family anymore, and as I’ve mentioned, Bob seems to have lost whatever he had. Either by divorce or something else, I’m unsure. I don’t press him for info because I wouldn’t want to be pried at either. 



“You writing your manifesto or something? I thought sitting and ignoring everyone was my thing, Dan.” Susan says as she walks by and bumps my stocking cap up. 

“I know I’m stealing your whole personality.” 

We both laugh a little as I put my notepad away. There are a few patrons eating in our fine establishment this morning. Getting in before we close early. It’s New Year’s Eve and the Obrinns want to let us have a break. The week leading to Christmas was a doozy when it came to business. It felt like half the town showed up. 

Susan makes her way to the last few groups, dodging the counter as she heads around. I tend to ram right into it, while she always swiftly swings her hip out of the way. 



“How’s the food today, gentlemen?” She announces. Two men sitting in the corner booth look up in partial surprise from her sudden appearance next to them. With a half stuffed gob, the stubbly one says, “Itsh good thanksh you!” The other man nods in agreement, wiping some mustard off his mustache. 

“Oh that’s wonderful! Are we all done here with the plates?” 

Both men nod rapidly and start collecting their mess, slightly embarrassed. Susan tends to have that effect on customers. Turning them all back into toddlers being told to finish up. 

“Perfect. I'll grab the check.” She then swiftly makes her way around to the kitchen door. I hear the clunk of everything hitting the sink as I print the ticket and grab a pen. I set the supplies on the counters edge right as Susan reappears. 

“Thanks!” Grabbing the paper and throwing me a wink. I wink back and go to the register. “Still so coy, ain-tcha.” Bob chimes in through the little window behind me. “You know it, bub.” I snap back. 

“Bub? I thought I was Bob? There’s an O not a U, Annie.” He chuckles and slides back to cleaning the fryer top. I can’t help but smile as I close the register with the men’s newly delivered payment. 

“The days almost over.” Susan says with a drawn out sigh. She stretches and twists her back, audibly cracking it. Her face gives a little twinge of “ouch”. 

“Almost. Seems like Bob has everything on his end tidied up, and I just have to move the cash from the register to the back.” I pull out the register's tray and set it aside. “Yeah, I got it lookin pretty damn good back here!” Bob yells from the back, quickly followed by a crash and splash. “Dammit! Well, not so much anymore!” 

Susan and I giggle as an annoyed mumbling rumbles from the window. 

“Like I said, almost.”

The sky darkens as the day passes. The ground is blanketed by the wet slush of early mounds of snow. The start of a long, tough winter. “It’s gonna be a deep snow this time round.” Bob lets us know. He puts on his big green windbreaker and brown steel toe boots as Susan and I follow suit. I’m wearing my black, puffy bomber and Susan dons her favorite parka. “Already getting pretty damn cold.” Susan shivers. 

“I'll get the car warmed up, don’t worry.” I point my thumb at my clunky dodge caravan. The car, that’s managed to survive my driving for almost eight years, has gotten quite the workout. I’ve had to get new power steering and redo my brakes a fair share of times, but it’s been my savior just as much. 

“Sounds like a good idear there.” Bob says, pushing his way out the door and heading for his truck. 

“He’s eager.” I say. Susan nods, “yeah, he’s really looking forward to meeting your bourbon stash.”

“Ha! I should have withheld that info better until we got to my place.” I zip my jacket and grab my keys from the hook. “I’m excited to see little pips again. The cutie.” Susan smiles softly, remembering my fuzz ball that awaits our arrival. 

“She’s been yelling at me all morning before I left. It’s like she knows when you guys are going to come over.”

“She's just tired of you and needs another woman around.” She bumps my arm and heads out the door. I raise my eyebrows, “Oh, she lets me know.” As I walk out the door, I see one of my neighbors cars head past towards Main Street. Then another I recognize goes by. “Huh, I guess they have some New Years plans too.”



“That’s the family across from you, isn’t it? You know, I caught her daughter sneaking peaks at you, playboy.” Susan gives me a devious smile. 

“She’s still in high school, so absolutely not.” I retort. Susan laughs as she walks. “Isn’t that what weirdo guys always want is some young high schooler?” 

“Gross Susan. Absolutely bleh.” I stick my tongue out. “I’m offended you would think of me in such a light.” I fling some snow from the hood of my car at her. She squeaks and runs to the car door of safety. Just before I get in myself, I hear Bobs truck turn over and stop. Another “chunk chunk chunk” flows into the air, followed by silence. 

“Well shit!” Bob says, stepping out of his old beater. “Uh oh” I say, stopping my descent into the driver seat. “Need a jump? I’ve got the cables.”

“Nah, don’t worry about it. You’ve got room in the back seat of your hunk-a-junk?” 

“For you? Always.” I say, waving him over. Bob leans back into his vehicle to grab his stubby coffee thermos and heads over. As I slide into my seat, Susan asks, “What’s wrong with it now?” 

“I don’t know. My guess is the battery.” Just then, Bob plops into the back right seat and fills us in. “It’s the battery. She warned me before heading to work, but I didn’t listen.” He lets out a sigh and settles into the seatbelt. I throw Susan a smile, proud that I guessed correctly. 

“Well, we’re happy to have you aboard the youngens crew.” Susan says. “Hey now, I’m only about ten years older than you wipper snappers.” 

“I thought you said you were turning fifty just yesterday?” Susan spins around to sass the inconsistent man. “Must of misheard me.” Bob gives her a cheesy grin. 

My car starts just after a few turns. I hear Bob grunt. It purrs with a loud rumble as I reverse and head on out. Turning right, I pull out onto the road. Another car I recognize as one of my neighbors, drives by. A hand waves as we pass each other. Waving back, I say, “Well, it seems we’ll be the only lights on in my neighborhood.”

The road is lit by headlights. The sky is pocked by clouds. The snow on the sides of the highway desperately reflects any remaining light, creating a reverse silhouette of the ground and sky.  The drive is beautiful, though. I’m glad I moved out there. The fields flanking the road are vast prairies. There’s not any houses built out in either direction, just the small cul-de-sac where my home resides. The highway used to continue all the way to the next town down the valley, but after more people moved into the area, they made a new highway and cut off this one. I’ve been told it’s because of city and county costs for upkeep. They would rather not keep repairing miles of road that little to no one actually used. Plus, they could just put an extra house right where the road continued. My house. 

“Oh cool! You have a road house!” Susan, ecstatic with her genius joke, yells at me. The sudden amazing joke makes me swerve a little. Bob explodes with laughter, leaning his head back with a loud cackle. 

“I knew” I say exasperated. “I just knew that joke would happen.” 

“Of course you knew.” Susan interpreted, “that’s why you bought the place.” She leans back into her seat, knowing she had won. “I’m sorry Dan-O” Bob leans forward wiping off sweat from his hilarity fit. “I’m torturing you with road shit from now on!” I reach back and slap at him. “Whoa! Hey! I’m sorry! She’s made me!” 

Getting two hands back on the wheel, I see a car parked along the side of the road, facing towards us. It’s off and seems to be empty. A limp face against the snowy background. “Hmph, I don’t recognize that car.” I mutter as I slow down to get a look. The car is completely frosted over. Through the icy fuzz, I can see it’s a 1983 Toyota Tercel. “Well… it’s not one of my neighbors.” The car slowly passes, letting me see the back window. An oddly colored smudge stuck out in the corner of the window. “Huh?”

“Why huh?”  Susan, looking over me to see the car, says half paying attention. 

“I… just hope whoever can come get their car.”

“Probably took a wrong turn, some tourist.” Bob says with a tinge of mockery. Passing the car completely, I look forward again. I can see the few trees on the right that signal your entrance to the cul-de-sac. The first two unlit houses pass. Then the next on the left. Then home.

“End of the road, boys and girls!” Bob says getting out of the car with a slight bit of extra effort. Susan and I follow. Stepping up, I see something in my window. Another odd smudge. It’s larger and whitish grey. It moves towards the door as I open. A slight shock of intense regret fills me. “What if it’s something bad?” A loud and sudden “mreeeoow” blurts out of the lightless home. “\*Gasp\* Hi pips!”

Susan trots over to the screaming pips, a light grey tabby. She picks the fuzzy alarm up and kisses the cat's face. “Oh I missed you little lady!” 

“Like I said, she’s missed you too.” I move past the two lovebirds. Bob stops to pet pips' currently un-smothered side. “Hey pips.”



The house is warm and bright, now that we settled in to celebrate. Busting out the bourbon and pretending to surprise Bob with it was a highlight. We played some games while watching Bill Maher warn us about the ball about to drop in Times Square. First, a few games of “Sorry!” Then, once we got bored with that, we played monopoly. As you can imagine, we decided to head to the living room to just sit and talk pretty soon after. It was me and Susan on opposite sides of the couch, and Bob in my hammy down lounge chair. The ball had dropped, and we were all feeling a general fuzz inside. 

“Damn good stuff you got here, Dan¬O. I’m proud my taste has rubbed off on you.” Bob raises his glass to gesture towards me, then back to himself. “Yes, of course.” I say, trying to decipher if that gesture was meant to be a toast. Susan, taking it as a sign for a toast, lifts her glass and announces “To the new year.” 

“To the three of us.” I with my glass, stand as I follow. 

“To taking a piss because I have to go.” Bob says, quickly re-raising his glass and reaching for my hand to help him up. Susan smiles and rolls her eyes at Bobs great ending to the toast. I chuckle and grab his hand. Pips rolls over in her bed, having no want to stay up this long for us humans new year. 

“God, I miss that cat.” Susan looks at Pips with genuine love in her eyes. 

“Yeah. I think we both just really missed you.” I let the thought spill out a little faster than I can fully comprehend the words. Susan throws a quick side eye at me. Not offense, but surprise. 

“I’ve missed you both too. Things have been… crazy lately.” She softly says the last part. Seeming to do the same as I had. The words roll in my mind for a second. “I hope things are alright…” I say.

“Yeah. Just getting past… you know who.” The memory of her coming to me in tears smashes up into my mind. She was bruised badly. A swell of sorrow and empathy wash over me. “Things are getting better, I hope.” Trying to comfort the thoughts bubbling in the room. 

“They are. Times just come and go, you know. I’ll be fine, then not so much anymore. Comes in waves.” She slowly slumps into the couch. Rubbing her finger on the side of her glass with far away eyes.

“I’m sorry, Susan. I understand. Things get real tough at times. I know the feeling. The lights do turn back on, though.” I say, sitting down closer to her. We sit staring out the front window. The dark horizon is flecked with small, barely visible stars. 

“It must have cleared up.” I say. It was a beautiful night out. 

“I really did miss you.” Susan says in a low voice. The sentence brings me back to sobriety. I’ve always liked Susan. As a friend, but I had daydreams about more. She had just always been with “you know who” up until two months ago. But I was going to be her friend and support first. I wasn’t going to look for an in when she was that far down. So I subdued my feelings and was there for her how she needed. 

“You’ve been such a…” she chokes some tears down. “Such a lifesaver for me, Dan. I don’t honestly think I would have made it past Christmas without you. Or Bob, of course, but you get me.” She giggles and I smile. 

“I’ll always be here, Susan. And I’m damn glad to have you around.” I slide my hand towards hers, which is now resting at her side on the cushion. She pulls a little from me, but then relaxes. Right then, Bob opens the bathroom door and shuts it loudly. 

“Woof a bit more than just a pee break.” 

Susan and I retract our hands quickly. Snapping back into a hopefully inconspicuous position. Bob, seeming not to notice, wades his way to the window. “Damn, it got real dark. Nice and crystal clear, though.” 

“True. Seems like your snow prediction won’t turn out.” I say, placing my last piece of ice from my glass into my mouth. 

“Oh it will. Which means we should probably deliver your two guests…” he bows a little as he presents himself and Susan. “Back to their homes. Unless I’m the only one going home tonight.” He spikes us with that comment as he turns to get in his jacket. Both me and Susan stifle a smile and blush red-hot, feeling caught.

Outside is extremely cold. The air immediately bites away at our skin. My breath turns to great plumes of mist. The three of us become a moving group of hand rubbing and brrrs.

Moving around to the car I see all my neighbors' homes are still without any lights. Their cars aren’t in their respective driveways, either. 

“I guess they are out for a long one.” I say unlocking my door and then releasing the other doors. 

“Shouldn’t their kids have school tomorrow? Not like I’m some parent but…” Susan shivers more as she leans into the car. Bob takes his place and off handily says. “Nah. The kids always get New Year’s Day off.” We all slam our doors close as Susan and I look at each other, then back at Bob. Susan laughs a little and says. “Why do you know that?”

Bob looks at both of us with a defensive eye. “Hey now I’m not on some list you freaks! I just used to work at the school. Janitor, if you couldn’t guess.” 

I laugh, turning back to start the mechanical icicle, while Susan just nods with understanding. “Yeah, makes sense.”



I let us stew in the frigid air to let my car get warm. Once I feel it’s reached an adequate temperature and the other two have annoyed me enough with their cries of “hurry up, my bits are freezing off!” I back out of the driveway. My headlights flash us with the image of the other houses. Lifeless and cold. My mind jumps to an abandoned town, with me alone and freezing. Susan interrupts this thought with her own odd visions. “Wooden corpses.” 

“Cut the creepy shit. Jeez.” I look in the rearview mirror at Bob. His face looks worried. Like legitimately worried for a split moment, then he settles back to his normal look. It seems we all had some intrusive thoughts. Each house passes by. One on the right. The next two flank both sides. Then nothing but frozen open road. 



The car now warm and moving, glides along the road. I turn up the air vents and try to lighten the mood with the radio. Flicking it on and turning the tuner proves a fruitless task. Nothing but hums and static come through. I keep an eye on the road but keep fiddling with the stereo. Not a single station. 

“Well, never mind on music.” I say giving up and just focusing on driving. The three of us are quite tired by this point. It’s 2:00 am and way past all our bed times. So the car stays generally silent. I occupy my mind with thoughts of the road. The time it takes to get to town is about twenty minutes. The speed limit is forty, and I’m not pushing it, so it’ll be about thirty minutes. The road has plenty of patch marks and crumbling sides. The snow has stayed off the warm asphalt, which is lucky for us. 

Susan lulls her head in a failed attempt at keeping sleep away. She's got her head down vigorously writing on her notepad. Presumably jotting down some idea for a future novel. She’s so beautiful. Long-ish black hair that starts to twirl right at the ends. Her eyes, a deep brown. Warm lips that smile even brighter. 

“Hey there, Dan-O, you're swerving a little.” Bob, rightly, brings me out of my fog eyed daydream. I slightly jump and adjust the car’s trajectory. Susan peaks at me with a small smirk. 

“Isn’t this where that car was sitting?” She points to the side of the road where the Toyota was sitting. “I guess whoever did come back to get it.” She says, closing her notebook, further giving in to sleep. 

“Glad they got out.” Bob says drearily. 

“I thought they were some dumb tourist?” I call back to him. Seeing that he’s grown a heart. 

“Sometimes I get grumpy about such things.”

Bob falls further into his own dreamworld. I smile and return my attention to the road.

Where the moon would cast enough light on the snow to semi illuminate everything, tonight is moonless. And extremely dark. Anything outside my high beams is an abyss. Which is why I didn’t see what I just hit. 

A sudden, blurry flash of color speeds into the light and subsequently my car. I slam the brakes, but the momentum carries us straight into whatever just jumped onto the road. We clipped the end of whatever it was, throwing it off the side of the road. The car lurches to the side, facing slightly to where the object was just thrown. Miraculously, the headlight isn’t out, but I can see bits of the plastic cover all over. 

“Jesus Christ!” Bob yells from the back. “What you hit? A truck?” 

“I don’t know, but god-damn that hurt.” Susan rubs her neck. Her head having slammed forward from the impact. 

“You ok Susan?” I say, catching myself reaching over to her. 

“I’m good. What the hell was that?” 

“I don’t know, but it was a fast sucker. Most dense deer I’ve ever hit.” I look back out towards the side. The snow glistened in the light. Just to the right, there was a lump of… something. Steam rose from the pinkish mass. I can barely see any details apart from it looks to be filleted. No blood from my vantage point, but sliced. Put into layers. The skin looks scabbed and blotchy. As I sit horrified, unable to move or tell my companions, the shape lifts. Ungulates. The sight spins my brain and I finally speak. “My god. What the fuck is it?”

“What do you mean?” Bob leans forward, trying to see the horror that has stunned me. 

“We need to leave, Dan! Please.” Susan states her terror so clearly, I don’t even question the choice. I stab the car back into gear and kick the pedal. Right as I do, the shape shudders and shifts violently upwards.

It stands on two feet. At the edge of the light, I only see half the sickening figure. The putrid thing stands on two feet! I start to freeze again. My bulged eyes glued to the horrid thing. Susan grabs my arm and yells, “Go damn it!” I go. My car screams forwards. We dip off the side of the road, but quickly swerve back onto flat raceway. I ram the pedal down to full speed. I start to breathe frantically, Susan starts humming with utter fear, Bob shifts away from staring back, screaming “Dan move! It’s coming! It’s fucking running!” The car yells in powerful rumbles as it gets pushed beyond any normal speed. Fear and disbelief pull my vision into pinpricks. We make incredible distance, but it doesn’t matter. The sliced meat slams against Bobs door. Without time for any of us to think, the door is all but ripped off. The monster reaches in and tears at Bob as he screams, half from relentless pain and half from sheer terror. The hellish thing grabs hold of Bob and jumps. Pushing so hard against the car it sways. Bob is ripped from the vehicle. The seat belt snaps like a rubber band. Suddenly, Susan and I are left in silence. The empty abyss fills with terrified and ceaseless screams. 

“Stop the car Dan!” At the command, I slam the brakes. The horrible screeching of the tires still isn’t enough to drown out Bobs sharp roars. Suddenly, my mind clears with memory. “I have a gun in the glove box! Grab it!” Susan takes no time to rip open the jockey box and hand me the revolver. In one swift motion, I spin and stand outside the driver's side door. I catch the faintest glimpse of bodies in the obsidian blackness, painted red from my taillights. I fire at the damned creature. No purchase. Bobs cries continue to fill the air. The sounds of the struggle move further away. Susan and I stand stunned and terrified. Faint screams echo through the night.  

“Where’d it go?” Susan trembles. 

“I can’t see anything.” I say. My left-hand shakes with the revolver pointed at any sound. 

“Let’s turn the car around and use the headlights. We have to hurry” Susan steps back into the car. “Come on Dan!” She yells, pulling me away from my stupor. I lower the revolver and get in the still running car. Breathing heavily, I twist the wheel and start the turn. Without dipping off the road, we turn and face the way from where we last heard Bob. The lights caress the landscape. The empty fields look to go on forever. An eternal abyss with no hope. 

Coming to a full 180, we see where the thing dragged Bob. “There’s our trail.” I say, staring at the blood staining the porcelain snow. Fearing Bob has already died, I hesitate. The carnage this thing left behind was terrible. If it can almost rip a car door off, what can it do to Bob. 

Susan looks at me and, with a shaking hand, places hers on mine. “I know. I know he’s probably gone, but until we check, I'll never forgive us. If you can’t tell, I'm mortified too. But we have to go. Bob is strong.” I let out a sharp and trembling sigh. We have to go. 

“Ok.” I shift and drive. 



The car dips and sways as we leave the road and start our new path. Living out here has instilled the need for winter tires into me. So the car has little to no trouble moving over the terrain. The sickly pale is broken occasionally by tuffs of dirt and dead grass. Consistent streaks of blood lead us forward. I roll my window down so I can hear anything that might give away Bobs position. The cold envelopes the cab. Susan has done the same and is staring out her side to find our friend. Occasionally, we hear a grunt or new hellish scream. The trail leads on. We are about thirty yards out when we hear something. Talking. 

It sounds like Bob and… something else. A constant muttering and Bob loudly saying “Shut up! Please god shut up!”

“He’s alive!” Susan exclaims with muted relief. I rev forward at a faster pace, making sure to not go too fast as to not accidentally run him over. The trails of blood and matted snow lead down a dip. My headlights shine straight over the decline, making it seem like a pool of tangible darkness. As we creep closer, the severity of the decline becomes obvious. It’s a sharp drop. How far down, neither of us can tell. “Damn it. I can’t risk this thing going down there.” I say pulling the hand break. “We could flip ourselves right on him.” I start to open my door. 

“Dan listen.” Susan holds her hand out towards me. I freeze and strain my ears. The sound of crunching snow becomes apparent. They're heading up from the ridge edge. I sit back down and lean out the window, aiming my revolver towards the snowy lip. “Thank god, I’m left-handed.” As I make my remark, a balding head appears. I tense my hand ready to blow the thing away when a hand lifts into the light. Bloody and missing a pinky and ring finger, Bobs terror struck visage runs up the hill. Susan exhales in true relief, making me realize I had been holding my breath too. I yell. “Hurry Bob!”

Susan gets out and flings open the rear right door. It squawks loudly from the force of its earlier encounter. She then runs over to Bob and helps him limp to safety. When they reach about a foot away from the hood, the fleshy monster reemerges. It’s fully illuminated in the high beams. The thing stands just shorter than Susan. It’s pink and red skin glistens with sweat. I had missed the fact that it had a mouth the first time. Barely visible teeth peak out from under one of the flab’s. Its eyes are sunken black thimbles behind more sagging chunks of skin and fat. Its heavy breathes steam as it huffs. The body is noticeably feminine, but if there are any actual genitalia, it's well covered by more off-color flaps. 

“Run!” I scream and take my place leaning out the window again. Before I get my sights on the blob, it lunges out towards Susan and Bob. I fire a shot, hoping to at least change its trajectory, but the bullet goes wide. They all fly forwards and splay out across the ground. I fling my door open and start to run. Before I even get around the car, it's on Bob again. Grabbing at his face and forcing his flailing arms down. It starts to scream in his face, “You're just a fucking pig! Worthless meat! Why’d you leave! She was right there, you bastard!” The words are filled with vile hatred. Pure spiteful sludge. Bob cries out, “Shut UP! Help!” 

Susan, regaining her feet, stomps down on the thing's head. Her boot squelches as it connects. The thing reels back and grunts, pulling away from Bob. Without hesitation, I aim and fire. The crack rings my ears. The shot strikes true, blasting through the chubby flaps around the creature's neck. It falls fully away from Bob and flails. The most horrendous, skull splitting scream, cries out to the cosmos. Susan covers her ears and stumbles backwards. The sound rattles my chest. Bob takes no time to kick away from the beast. The thing crawls frantically away back down the slope. From the wound, a slick, brownish liquid spills to the ground. It smells of an unkempt gym locker and tangy bile. In the darkness, I can hear its breaths weaken.

“Dan, help me get him in the car!” Susan pulls Bob up and slings his arm around her. I peel my sight away from the inky pool and go to help. All three of us shuffle to the back passenger door and slide Bob in. Quickly, Susan runs around to the other back seat and sits next to him. I follow and retake my driver's seat. I push the hand break down and crank the wheel left. I slam the pedal and spin the car back towards our tracks. Quickly following them back to the highway. 

“Jesus, Bob, you're bleeding all over.” She looks around for something cloth to make sudo bandages, “Dan, I need something to help stop the bleeding.” 

“All the way in the back, there are some blankets and a backpack with shirts in it.” My sad little winter survival bag was never really meant to help with full-blown medical emergencies, but here we are. I keep my eyes scanning for anything other than snow. Either the road or that fleshy mass. Susan reaches over the back seat and grabs the backpack. Bob helps by holding it open as she pulls out three shirts. “Keep yourself steady, girl, I’ve got a lot of time before I bleed out.” Bobs exasperated words get a mean side eye from Susan as she starts ripping the shirts to make multiple bandages. “How the hell did you get that thing off the first time?” I ask. “I have a way with words.” He says, coughing before continuing, “plus a good right hook always helps.” We all can’t help but smile. 



The road appears ahead, and I take no time to get back on track. “Small bump here.” I warn my friends. Susan stops wrapping Bobs hand for a moment to let the bump swing us all from left to right as we re-enter the road. Getting to flat ground, I hammer the pedal forward. I'm not sticking around to find out if my shot was enough to kill it.  

“I hope that’s better, Bob.” Susan leans back and sighs. She shivers a small bit and looks out the window. “It’s better.” Bob takes a deep breath, clearly holding back painful moans. “Thanks Suz.” 

“So what’s the damage on you. Full report.” I say. I want to know how much time I have and how much Bob can do. If we find something else. 

“Well Sarg, I have a piece bitten out of my shoulder, insane scrapes all over from my free sled ride, oh, and I’m missing two fingers.” Winded from his report, Bob slowly slumps down in the seat. 

“You're one tough son of a bitch.” I say, amazed at how he’s even still awake. 

“Don’t talk about my mother that way.” Bob retorts. “What did you talk with that monster about?” Susan poses the question, silencing the cab. Bob rolls his head back. Takes a deep breath, and tells us. 

“It was my wife.” I clench my hands on the steering wheel. Susan slowly turns towards Bob. “What?”

“Well, it was her voice at least. And… her words. You two don’t know this, but I was married twenty years ago. Margaret. We had a kid together and everything was fine. Was. My…” His voice creaks slightly. “My daughter Clare… went missing. Right in our backyard while I was just inside.” I can sense the tears welling in Bobs eyes. “There was the forest right behind our lot. We don’t know who or what did it, but. She's gone.” The car feels colder than ever before. Bob shifts to look out the window. Out into the empty shadows. “After it all happened, our marriage got horrible. We’d fight. Almost any second we weren’t drunk, we’d fight. I started to hate her guts as much as I’m sure she hated mine.” A long, silent pause sets upon us. “It all ended after I….hit her. She never stopped yelling at me. I asked her to stop. Begged! But I couldn’t take it.” 

“No need to go further, Bob, we understand.” I try to save us all from living through that abuse again. Susan sniffles and shifts a bit further onto her side. The vast, freezing road lies ahead. I blink away tears.

Clouded sky gives way to milky dark water. Cold snow holds the ground. Mountains stare and watch unrestrained. Uncaring wind speaks softly through the trees. A cold man sits on the bench. 



It’s a beautiful day today. It’s calm and peaceful. I’d love this kind of day under normal circumstances. I always liked the cold and snow. When the hustle of humanity would be forced to slow down as the new year passes. On a normal day, I would find myself here. But it’s been three weeks since I’ve seen another living thing, and I’m scared. 



It happened without any fanfare. I didn’t see the sky open up and everyone else flying away. I simply awoke to a vacuous world. No animals, people, insects, or the like. Though everyone didn’t leave peacefully it seems. My house was left mostly untouched, but all the surrounding houses are… well ruined. Some have all their windows busted, doors falling off their hinges and hastily moved luggage strewn about. It looked as if some people were preparing to leave in a hurry and others were simply torn away. Whatever happened, I had missed the train ride to hell. I slept through the rapture. 



I wasn’t in my home when I awoke, though. Not only that, but I was sitting here looking out at the lake with no memory of ever coming here. There was little to no wind. Silence held its grip over all. The only sound I heard was the faint laps of the lake water sliding to shore. I stood dazed and looked around. I found a lonesome shoe sitting in the dead grass a distance away. Looking towards the park of which this bench is a part of I saw empty and smashed cars. 

Quietly, I walked my way up the road towards the highway. Along the way I saw torn bits of clothing but no blood. No bodies. There was a deep rip in the dirt where presumably someone driving away hit the edge hard and tore away at the ground. Getting to the highway, I just saw a few wrecked cars and some simply abandoned. Turning right, I headed towards the super 8 market. “A grocery store with a little bit of everything!” As the ad always read. 

Remembering this walk still chills my heart and threatens me with such dread. Seeing the simple yet all encompassing damage the world had taken. Shattered glass here with some thrown about debris there.  Nothing was freshly torn apart or newly broken and spilling. It all seemed to happen a day or two ago. I was so terrified making my way back through town. It had just started to snow then. 

Finally getting to my home and seeing it still standing was the first relieving thing I’d seen. My neighbors roof had partially caved in as snow covered her living room. Katie lived alone like me. Now she’s gone too. I realize how badly I miss our brief talks. She made the mundane topics of life seem so easy and nice. I never got the nerve to ask her to dinner. What a mistake. 

My other neighbor on the west side had a torn off door and smashed front window, but it’s all mostly still there. He was an old fellow whom I rarely ever talked to but was always very friendly. His wife died some years ago, and I feel he was waiting out his time. Nothing there now. 

My house was the same as the two flanking it, though in much better shape. One floor, two bedroom, one bath. When I stepped inside, my body heaved with exhaustion. The shear stress of making it back home was overwhelming. The kitchen to the right was as I left it. Semi clean. The living room to the left was also as it should be. Couch in front of the window facing a tv sitting on a pioneer stereo. Further down the hall I see the bathroom is fine. My guest room to the right still had nothing but storage in it. Random boxes of left over things. I never use the room for anything else. And finally to the left was my bedroom. Queen-sized bed with one night stand and a full closet. Simple. Nothing more nothing less. 



I live in northern Montana in the town called Kalitfish. A very small town of about 5,000. We sit at the top of lake Rockhead, facing south. The nearest town is over an hour away, and in any other apocalyptic event, I’d say this wouldn’t be too bad a spot to hold out. But with everything gone I’d say I’m dead already. I’ve been scrounging for food around here as best I can, but there really isn’t much left. I got left the scraps. If I could find a vehicle with gas still in it, I don’t really know where I would go. I imagine the rest of the world is like this. Yes, I’d get more food but what then? Plus it’s been snowing a good bit up here already and by this point the roads are probably impassable. 



I had hung around my house in a haze of crying and confused disbelief for a few days. Using up my currently available resources. I didn’t dare make too much noise, for a time when I didn’t know if whatever took everyone might have still been around. But by about the 6th day I went out to the street in a grief riddled daze and started to scream. Hoping to call whatever took them all away would come get me. But nothing ever came. 

I calmed myself down and reset my mind. Simply trying to rationalize what my situation is. Then I went exploring. 

A bit more confident after not getting immediately killed by some creature, I poked into some houses to see what I can gather. Some untouched houses had some good stuff. One had half a pantry of canned beans. Some real survival shit there. Others were pretty cleaned out, and some had been damaged and rotted beyond safe traversal. 

Whatever took, everyone really wasn't concerned about how. And the ones being taken did whatever they could to try and get away. Which left me having to pick at ripped rice bags. 



Going into the rest of my little town, I found more destruction. The snow was piling up pretty good down Main Street. Some cars on the strip were actually not all that bad. One SUV was in very good shape compared to all I’ve seen. However, it didn’t have anything of use in it. Just an insurance card in the glove box. 

Many of the shops were broken and disheveled. The Electronica shop looked to have been looted in someone’s last ditch attempt at a new CRT. It lay smashed on the ground some feet away from the window. 

 I had to dig my way into the hardware shop. It was particularly bad in here. Several shelves were knocked over, and the register was in pieces. Tools, wires, and PVC pipes were strung out everywhere. A hole in the corner part of the roof let in a stream of white snow. Still warmer than outside, but much too cold to stay. I had gone in there to grab myself a pad lock because I had started to… act up at night.



 I don’t know if it’s the stress or if I’m simply going off it, but I’ve started to sleepwalk. And I mean really hard. The first night it happened, I slept very soundly. But at about 2:00 I woke up and found myself standing at the end of my bed facing my door. It concerned me because I’ve never had bouts of sleeping walking before, but under the current circumstances I guessed it was stress and moved on. The next night I woke up about the same time, but I was facing my front door. Though just my body was. My head was fully turned to the right and looked at my living room. Like I was taking it in before leaving the house. I was suitably freaked out by what my body was doing whilst I slept. I decided to give myself a huge “day off” to try and alleviate this problem. Staying inside and trying to live my normal routine while the outside froze. The power has somehow been able to stay on this entire time. Damn lucky with how the weathers been. 

The third night made me get the padlock. 



I awoke to the bitter biting of freezing wind and snow. My eyes barely could open to see where I even was with how bad it was blowing that night. I quickly turned around hoping to find my house and yes, it was there. Except it was five houses away from me. The only reason why I could even see it was because I left the porch light on. Half freezing to death, I had been walking down the middle of the road towards the Super 8. Still in my pajamas and completely bare foot. I ran towards home. The howling of the wind in my ears was driving me wild. Getting in, I slammed the door behind me. Barely able to move my hands, I struggled to lock the door. The warmth of the house stung, as it always did when you go from very cold to very warm. In my sleep delirium I had managed to unlock the bolt and handle locks, open the door, close it behind me and head out. Entirely ignoring the burst of cold and the stabs of snow hitting my face. 

The other houses looked creaturely that night. Bulky shadows staring at me as I ran. Mouths agape, beckoning me in for their warmth. The thrown around clothes looked like long frozen bodies. The fly traps droppings. Scraps. 

Needless to say, I was very prompt in my decision to get that pad lock. 



Returning from the hardware store, my neighbors homes didn’t look so hungry anymore. Emaciated, but not out to get me. I took my time putting up the new lock. I wanted to make sure it was plenty secure for the next night. 

Which brings me back here. To the bench. I wanted to look out over the lake. Since the first night I started to sleepwalk, I’ve had such an impenetrable sense of pure dread. I feel something is coming or something is happening. I’m honestly scared to sleep tonight. My tongue is dry, and my leg won’t stop shaking. Despite all this, I still feel so tired. Like I’m full of sand. Pulling me down.  

Ugh, I really don’t want to sleep tonight. But I’m fading fast here. 



The snow is coming down steady, like it has been. If I don’t starve first, I’ll be buried. My walk back is even quieter than before because of this. Despite being in the frozen wastes for three weeks, I’m still scared I’ll turn a corner and find something awful waiting. Or that I’ll be found by something awful. 

Making my way through the roads on about the same path I took the first day I woke up, I'm as scared now as I was then. The cars are now just mounds of snow. Vague lumps like a dream of a highway. It’s a struggle to get through all this. And it’s very, very cold. In some way, the cold helps me move through the powder by making it somewhat solid. But that’s about all it does. If I get out of this somehow, if everything was just some horrid nightmare, I’m moving to somewhere hot all year round. I hate snow. 

The super 8 looks of a monument to ice and concrete. So desolate and foreboding. I used to work there. Had a decent position stocking shelves and handling every merchant that we did business with. There was just enough people to keep it pretty busy most times. Jake was a great friend and fellow employee. Worked hard and always had something dumb to say. Seeing it so dark makes me sad. The inside is completely ransacked by me and those who were taken before.



Approaching my street I hear something. I stop stock still. I strain to hear through the ashen flakes. 



\*thwump\* 



I drop to the ground, sliding myself to a snow drift just to my left. Breathing wildly. It came from across the street. I think the red-ish house. Oh, god, what is it. Nothing has made a sound since this all started. I try to calm my heaving breath while I peek over the drift. Nothing but snow. The house is no more special than mine. Its door is closed and the windows intact. I can’t remember if I went inside that one. I don’t think I did, no. So I have no reference for what could have made that sound. I stare into the white, straining to see or hear anything that might give a hint. Nothing. I slide back down and sat. Giving my adrenaline time to subside. My current guess is maybe the snow on the roof got too heavy and slid off one side. Would explain the size of the sound. 

Paranoid.

Giving myself one last deep breath, I get up, brush myself off and start towards my home again. Keeping my eye on the house for which the sound came from. I don’t see where from the roof some snow had dropped. There’s no bare patch of shingles. I look towards the door. Wait, was it always cracked open? No, I saw it was closed. But maybe from my previous angle I couldn’t see the slight opening? The obsidian abyss behind it pierces my soul. I pick up the pace as I just get past the home and the front door goes just out of sight. I turn, facing where I’m walking. I start to run. 

Nothing gave chase. 



Getting inside I immediately lock everything up. I fumble with the new padlock from the fear of something reaching out to grab me. Once it’s done I back away from the door, staring at it. Waiting for something to thud, bang on the door, scream after me. But nothing did. 

My body relaxes after I stand for what seemed like hours staring at the front door. I must be losing it. It’s not impossible for something to thud out there. The whole world has been ransacked. There’s no doubt that it was just some snow falling off whatever roof. I grab some food and sit on my couch. I stare at my empty tv, reflecting on my own mind, and try not to overthink. My eyes begin to falter. That little bout of terror and running exhausted my already tired body further. I hadn't forgotten about my sleepwalking. I should get to my bed but… I’m so tired. 



2



A broken window gnashes its shards. The wind goes from screaming to howling, crying to weeping. A house delves deeper into frozen depths. Then the land falls silent. A cold man stands by the lake. 



I awake violently. The jolt about knocks me over, but I catch myself. Looking down, I see I still have my boots on? Along with pebbles and rocks of all shapes and sizes. Dark-colored eyes all looking at me. I begin to feel the cold. I quickly look up and see nothing but water. I’m at the lake shore. Spinning around, I see the rest of the park buried in snow. The bench, however, is not covered at all. In fact, it’s stopped snowing entirely, as if to keep the bench untouched by ice. 

The clouds are still grey above me. Looking back towards the shore I see the long wooden dock stretch out into the vast lake. The snow on the dock seems to be disturbed. With my mind still fogged from waking up in such a state, I walk over to see how exactly it’s been disturbed. What I find is mortifying. 

There are clear footprints here. I would think they’re mine seeing as I’m the only one here and clearly the pad lock didn’t work. But… it looks like whoever was walking was dripping wet. The signs of water falling on snow. The odd holes and preserved splash marks like an avant-garde painting.  Except I’m not soaking wet at all. My sleeping body didn’t just go out for a swim. In fact, I’m covered head to toe with all my regular snow gear. Thick wool shirt, two jackets, long Johns, snow pants and boots. I couldn’t be more dry and warm out here.  

These aren’t my prints. 

The shoe size is just too small and that in itself isn’t right. They are “shoe” prints, not my boot prints.  They look like office shoes. There’s someone else here.  



With terror striking its way up my spine, I scan the park for anyone. My breathing is getting heavier by the second. I don’t see anything, and without the snowfall I’m able to see much clearer. Helpful and all the more horrible. I see the tracks make their way towards the little road leading out of the park. Whoever it is had left. But they put themselves between me and home now. 

I make my way along the tracks. Keeping hyper vigilant of any sound or movement. My eyes dance from one blinding white lump to the next. Scanning past every tree to catch an angle on whoever was taking a stroll. Fear soaking every movement I make.  I continue to follow the tracks, and they in turn continue to make their way towards my home. On the highway, I see they go right down the middle of the road. Only veering slightly from the double yellow lines. Or where they would be under all the powder. I’m creeping as best I can whilst trying to contain my breathing and clear my mind. I need to be as calm and alert as possible. 

The tracks keep going. And going. All the way until my road splits off to the right and the tracks go up a small ridge towards the super 8 market. Slightly relieved to see they don’t go toward my house I stop by a shed nearby and survey.

There are two car lumps on the road to my right and some streetlamp poles to my left. I can just see the top of the building over the ridge. The grand super 8 sign stands tall above. The lights beaming upwards cast an eerie amber glow. I now notice they stand out so much because it’s getting darker. I don’t know what time it is, but I feel it’s not the sun setting, rather the clouds darkening further with threats of even more snow. And it’s probably going to be a blizzard.



I want to go home. I need to go home, but… those prints are “human”. If by some miracle someone crawled their way back from the void, I imagine they aren’t in good shape. Besides, if they are soaking wet, that’s death in this cold. They may need help. I don’t know how they would have gotten here, but I also don’t know why everyone left in the first place. Anything is on the table. 

I stand, dreading my decision. I follow the tracks again. Still being as careful as I can be with snow up to my thighs, I make my way to the ridge. Laying in the fluff just before the top and peeking over. The super 8 looms like a castle beyond the parking lot. And standing just before it is a shape. A dark pillar. A person. 

I try to catch more details, but at this distance and in the low light I can’t make out much. They aren’t very short. Maybe, say, six foot? Male by the blocky stature. They’re not wearing a jacket. Just standing. Could be swaying slightly. 

Oh, please just let me leave. 

I stand and walk. 

This is insanity. 

I continue standing tall. 

About halfway through the parking lot, I can see that they have dark hair. 

Jesus, it really is a person. 

Further on, I walk. 

Closer, I can tell they’re still wet. 

How haven’t they been frozen yet they’re soaked! 

At 20 feet away, I call out.



“Hey!” 



My voice shakes my heart. Skipping a beat. 

The world seems to reel from the sound. The person stops swaying and starts to turn. As they do, I begin to smell something off. It’s the smell of lake water. The smell of waterlogged dead wood. A tinge of rotting fish and a miasma of algae. I realize my horrible mistake of coming here. 

They turn further. Slowly, allowing me all the time to see them. It is a man in what looks like a two-piece suit. It’s dark with moisture. His hands are grayish. Ears are almost white. The face isn’t there. He has no features on that shaggy haired ball. It’s just waves of faint light and a stretched hole delving deep into his head. 

I begin to tremble with mortification and disgust. Despite his lack of mouth he speaks. It comes in putrid stutters. Foaming, bubbling, coughing words spray forth. 



“…is deep-p-p….d-dar-rk…beautiful-l-l…” 



Water streams down his pale neck. 

My eyes stare wild. I can’t move! I can’t run!

More gurgling emerges from the man. He takes one lumbering step towards me. I’m frozen but screaming inside. Run damnit! 

The man’s hand begins to twitch violently. Twisted spasms take his fingers and bend them in all directions impossible to the human hand. The sudden movement kicks my legs into overdrive. I run right. Lunging through the snow as fast as I can manage. Stupid terror sprints through my senses. I’m numb with it. I recognize the drift where I once hid before and head to the other side, trying to break line of sight. I continue up my road, heaving my legs through the darkening wastes. Small flecks begin to fall once more. I didn’t even notice the wind starting to scream. 



I burst inside my home and, faster than I’ve ever before, lock the door. I jump over to the front window and draw the curtains. Panting I stop to assess. 

“Ok…ok. That thing probably didn’t see me head off here.” 

Then realization strikes me. 

“Oh god-damn, my tracks!” I half shout, startling myself. The exact way I found him is how he’ll find me. I have to do something. I look out my front window. The snow is starting to really come down. The wind is streaming the fluffy crystals forward at an alarming speed. Something catches my eye through the veil. The houses across the street look squashed. No, they look completely collapsed. Sunken. I run to my small kitchen window. The old man’s house is just four vacant walls now. Absolutely ruined. Knowing how Katie’s house looked, I assume it’s even worse now. My house seems to be the only place nearby that isn’t a pile of wood and shingles. 

“I’m a shining beacon for that thing to come knocking now.”

I slump next to my counter. 

“I’m screwed. So screwed.” I let out a small laugh at my situation. 

“What the hell did I do in life to get this shit of a straw.”

I don’t know what to do. My mind swims with the horrors. His soaking wet body. His hole face that bubbled with words. He must have just come from the lake.

“Whatever the hell that means.” I softly speak. 

 I decide that lying down and letting whatever he is take me might be worse than freezing or starving. So I start barricading myself in. Get my couch barred against the front door. Rip off cabinet doors to patch up the windows. One in the kitchen, one in the living room, and one above my bed. I brace my coffee table against the couch to further stop anything from even attempting coming through. My bed frame was just big enough to cover my larger front window. There are enough cracks for me to see through to the white hell burning outside. I refuse to sleep tonight. I set my tv on the floor next to the living room window. White knuckling a steak knife. Watching. 



My bedside clock reads 11:45. It’s pitch black out. I don’t have any lights on, hoping to not attract any more attention. I’ve been scanning the street for anything besides snow to shamble by. Waiting for him to show up at my door. 

The wind has done nothing but howl. Screeching around my home with reckless disregard for anything not nailed down. The flakes falling now are thick to an unholy degree. Snowballs pelting my poor town to death. Burying its corpse. Entombing me. Trying to listen through the wind is fruitless. Its cacophony is unsettling and forceful. Even if I did want to sleep it would be a struggle. 

I’ve managed well to stay awake so far, but there’s plenty of night to come. My bone's creek from sitting in this mummified position. Staring relentlessly, my eyes are dry and my head hurts. A dull pulse, most likely due to the drop in adrenaline. My feet ache from these ill-fitting boots. I’m not risking taking all my gear off just in case I decide to pass out and leave once again. Though that would be quite the task now. I’m really feeling the effects of my mad dash home. My mind still spins with the soaked man’s image. 

The clock reads midnight. 



3 



Deep sharp snow piercing through cloth. Oceans of shale clouds crash above. Ever gentle flakes fall without a word. Icy footsteps. A cold man lies on the ground. 



 My head rings with pain. My left eye sees through a red tint. Through my fogged vision, I see nothing but white. I’m outside again. But the clouds seem very close. I open my eyes wide to try and understand what I’m looking at. It’s my ceiling, not clouds. So I’m still inside. I groan as the rest of me wakes up. My right side ribs scream out in protest. My left foot cries. The cold nibbles at my skin. What happened? 

Through much effort and even more pain, I gradually sit up. My world spins for a sec and I almost vomit. My home is a mess. From where I’m sitting at the left wall of the living room, I see destruction. The tv is shattered. The stereo is thrown on its side and smashed. Almost all the drawers in the kitchen have been strung out and tossed. There are splotches of blood. The floor is sopping wet and snow is lightly floating in from the hall. 

I sit trying to understand what happened. I can’t remember much. What I do remember comes in flashes. I see my bathroom and the one small window smashed in. The one I forgot. The one I expected nothing to be able to get through. Then I remember pain. Images of something hitting me appear as consciousness leaks back into me. My head got rammed against the hallway wall. I was thrown. I fought back with animal like cruelty. Then all blank from there. 

My barricades are still standing where I fastened them before. Though they had clearly taken a beating. I try to stand and through so much pain I make it upright. Leaning against the wall and holding my side, I peer around the corner towards my bathroom. Snow is pouring in from outside. It’s light out and not at all windy but still snowing like mad. I look at my guest room. The door is on the floor but not much inside the room seems not to have been touched. Then I look to my bedroom. The door is in half and I can’t see into the room at all from where I’m leaning.  

I take a few short breaths and start to slide my way along the hallway to take in the damage. 



\*crack\* 



I freeze. Silence engulfs the house. I hold my breath, listening. 



\*snap\* 



Another deep pop follows. Then another. 

I stand straight up and start to back away from the bedroom. My eyes stare at the doorway, split between red and normal vision. My left eye is just a fuzzy mess from the blood that has leaked into it. But I know what I’m seeing. 

A gray, festering hand grabs the door frame. Gripping hard it pulls. A carpeted sliding follows the movement. The hand grabs further in the hall, ripping at the floor. I back away further but fall, not noticing the end of the wall. Pain rings out in my mind. The hand takes no time to keep pulling. Shaggy leach like hair appears. Its pitted face emerges slobbering. Gurgling fills the room. The soaked man sloughs further forward.  His left shoulder is dangling well behind where it should be. Holding by a thread of rubbery flesh and cloth. He pulls further. I scoot myself back towards my living room unable to look away. My mind screams with fear. The soaked man sings. 

“..is deep-p .. i-is da-a-rk… is beautiful..”

He spasms again violently, this time his head rakes right around. Fully breaking its own neck. And yet, he still pulls. And yet, he still sings. 

“…s-soo daaark-k … sooo..DEEP…so beautiful..”

As he pulls more, his head slowly twists back into place. Making rancid sounds of bone snapping and clumping back into place. 

I’ve seen enough. I have to leave. 

He continues forward along the ground crawling at me. All the while he sings the same phrase over and over and over. I spin around and start tearing at the bed frame. I rip my nail of my right middle finger. I don’t even flinch from the pain. I tear more boards away. 

“….daa-ark…”

More sounds of horrible spasms and crushing bone. 

“ …and beautifu-ll”

Thick wet snaps like breaking zucchini. 

I tear enough away to get to the window. I start to punch at the glass. 

“..iiiiSs-ss deeeeeep..”

My fist is bloody, but it’s working. 

I hear a wet snipping sound, followed by a weak “thwump” on the carpet. I take half a look behind me. The soaked man is standing now, and his arm has finally fallen away. I start to scream as I punch through the glass. It tears up my jacketed arm and draws blood. I squirm my way through the now shattered window. Getting glass stuck in my hands and knees as I escape. I braced myself expecting a small fall but the snow is so built up I just slide out. Pain swallows me. I regain my feet and limply begin to run. I look back as I go, just in time to catch a madly spiraling hand rip through the opening. Finding nothing, the hand recedes. 



I force myself to keep a steady but horribly painful pace. I can’t see more than a house away. A deep fog has laid itself down on Kalitfish. I frantically look for anything I can run too. The house closest to me is nothing but splinters and a mailbox. I limp forward. The next house comes into view, but it’s just the front facing wall left. 

“Damnit why” I whimper

Just then I look farther down the road and see and orange glow. The grand Super 8 sign lights beckon me towards them. I run. 

The snow trailing behind me has streaks of red. Painting a grizzly image. Some drifts reach up to my face in impenetrable mounds. I run around them, trying to keep the lights within my sight. My focus is purely on those lights, but in my peripheral I catch a human figure just a few feet from me on my right. I don’t stop. I hear more gurgling. Higher pitched than the soaked man’s normal babbling. Further on, I get a glimpse of two figures off to my left. One was on the ground but still reaching up towards the second. The other stood over them with an axe. She took the others legs. I pass, stifling a scream as I hear them both sing that broken tune. More sickly voices sing to my right, but I don’t see where from. I’m just a block away from the lights. 

I’ve lost my left boot at some point. I don’t pay it a moments thought before I realize I made it. The snow thins out significantly going on the blacktop parking lot. I move closer to the sign. It’s lights blazing upward letting me read “SUPER 8 MARKET”

However, the lights are shining off something else. No, this is wrong. The sign is now standing dead center in front of the main building. It’s no longer at the edge of the lot. I slow my approach. The sign stands proud right in front of the entrance. The building has become a brutalist symbol of horror. No paint, no other windows, just one gaping maw and the depths of an abyss within. 



I stand defeated. This world won’t let me be. It just led me to something else. I don’t know what I was expecting. 

“Fucking why?!” I scream into the void. 

A smell answers me. I retch instantly. Heaving, I fall to my knees. Giving up my guts from the smell. It’s like the soaked man but far stronger. The smell of rot way more present than ever before. With my eyes bulging, I look up towards the opening. I see a glint of very faint orbs flash in the dark. Metallic eyes stare back at me. Something heard me. 

A sixteen fingered hand smashes down through the doorway. I feel as its immense force rattles the ground. The arm is a sinewy mess of very skinny and taught, to bulging tumorous masses. The color like that of dead bodies. The texture was smooth like dolphin's skin. The hand flexes as a wet squelching sliding sound rings out. 

A failed imitation of a head and face comes forth. Great mercury eyes gaze crazily at me. Two small, bottomless pupils spill into my mind. Making me feel like my head is splitting open. The mouth a gash where one would think to add it. A viscous drool slides down its chin. Another many fingered hand reaches forward. Bloats of puss stick out around its wrist. It’s long pale fingernail pokes at my temple. 

I scream. 

 Thousands of voices scream at my consciousness. All saying: 



“The lake is oh so beautiful. So deep. So dark. The lake is loving and sweet. So sensual and lustful”



I scream louder. I scream harder. I scream until I see blood fly out of my mouth. I scream until darkness fill my mind. I scream until my head splits in two. 



4



As I sit up, I feel the bench below me. The world is silent once again, bar the sound of the waves hitting the shore. I can’t see the mountains or any distant landmark. Nothing but the beautiful lake. It’s so calming and peaceful. I stand and find my body bleeding and ravaged. I’m also covered in a sticky substance. It makes my skin feel itchy. I need to wash off. The lake calls me. 



“Wash”



“I feel unclean.”



“Wash”



“I will. I need to for you”



“Come”



“Oh yes, thank you”



I start to walk to the water



“Oh look at your waves. Such curves and swirls”



“Further”



“Oh wonderful.”



My feet hit the tide



“Ah how cold and refreshing”



“Further”



“Yes. Your crisp currents pull at me”



I wade up to my thighs

I begin shaking uncontrollably



“oh the relief”



“Wash. Further”



“Yes. Your deep takes me”



It’s up to my chest



“Oh, your strength humbles me so”



“Further”



“I shall drink from your dark heart.”



It’s up to my neck



“Such beauty. The sensations”



“Further”



“Oh.”



I’m shivering wildly



“I…s-so….cold”



“Further”



The water takes me.



“C-cold”



A sublime heart is steadied. The mountains close ever hateful eyes. The wind rests its soul. The snow glimmers in the sunlight. Man’s machinery echoes through the trees. Mounds are scattered.

A cold man sinks below.

So I went to meet her for coffee and she didn't show up or even text to say that she wasn't coming. I'm starting to think that I'm never going to be happy,1,1740799556.0,lonely,3,1.0,False
1j0q551,https://www.reddit.com/r/womensolocamping/comments/1j0q551/short_solo_backpacking_trip_in_joshua_tree/,Short solo backpacking trip in Joshua Tree National Park,"I'm very comfortable dayhiking alone in JTNP, even off-trail, but have yet to backpack there alone. Thoughts of mishaps and of course two-legged threats have always bothered me but were quieted when I had others around. I've been in a very muddy headspace lately as I trudge through the job search game and the constant bombardment of unpleasant news coming from all the media regarding our public lands. I needed to unplug and JTNP has always been my safe haven. 

Started the day by exploring near the North Entrance of the park. I like to look for old mining sites. Never know what you might find. To my dismay I ended up finding about 7 mylar balloons throughout the hike (my ultimate hiking nemesis). They filled up my backpack and one turned my hands blue.

[Most accessible mines are barred for safety. The bars are wide enough to let bats, and sometimes tortoises, through.](https://preview.redd.it/x1efjjpsgzle1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed32b2db7b52a658300fef2600ca35f3740c45ee)

After that hike I went to another mining site but with a different goal. I recently found an old archive of photos of the park and found one of Elton mine, a site accessible via the Lucky Boy loop trail. [I feel like I found the right spot and I shared this on another sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoshuaTree/comments/1izy50q/elton_mine_1967_vs_today/)

After that I headed out to the Boy Scout trailhead to set out to my campsite. Backpacking is allowed in vast areas throughout the park but I wanted something a little more controlled for my first time alone so I opted for the Boy Scout trail which requires camping at one of fifteen sites. It was a short couple miles and I found the site with no issues. 

I threw on an airpod to play some music while setting up to calm my nerves but I found that I really didn't need it. I wasn't as nervous about this experience so far as I anticipated. I was really enjoying it. So much so that I ended up poking a hole through my tent with one of the poles because I was multitasking. Luckily I carry patches in my first aid kit and it gave the tent some character.

[You can see the patch if you zoom in on the rear peak. Oops. I've been fooled by the wind before so I was in the process of reinforcing points with rocks. The juniper was helping too. ](https://preview.redd.it/tv88z07xkzle1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab5d38ac1339b42ae31afd184f3c3f558c2efacc)

After setting up I had my obligatory beer to start winding the day down. This site had a nice pile of boulders near to get a great view of the surrounding landscape. 

[A southeast view towards the Wonderland of Rocks and technically the trailhead if you have super vision. ](https://preview.redd.it/p501pcwjlzle1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ac6bcf19ed4acea4a8ef7e650f83eb32c168f1a)

I stayed up there to watch the sunset and headed down before it got too dark. I bundled up (it was warmer than I planned so barely) and then started making dinner. I'm not a fan of cleaning up a kitchen situation so freeze dried meals are my friend. This one was actually really good. I added some sriracha because spice is life.

[There were ants crawling about trying to get my food and maybe toes.](https://preview.redd.it/pns5r25knzle1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72ee14e9b495219328c73f10b151e5e290c169ed)

After dinner I headed back up the rocks to watch the stars. I didn't plan it this way but it was almost a new moon so they were really visible. Pictures don't do it justice. At the top I could also see the headlamps from other campers at nearby sites (I stayed red to keep incognito). It was nice to know other people were out here too enjoying the night. Another thing you could see were all the cars coming down the road from Keys View, a notorious spot to take pictures at sunset and sunrise. 

[Can you spot a popular constellation?](https://preview.redd.it/uieeyw2dpzle1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0e9a405eef35cd28bf0c9f71f90a95926639009)

I headed to bed early. I had brought my Nintendo Switch thinking I'd need Stardew Valley to chill me out if I was getting nervous. I played for like 5 minutes realizing I didn't need it and could have saved 14 oz from my pack. I listened to music instead and drifted off to sleep. I did wake up a couple of times in the middle of the night hearing things that got my imagination running but I ended up being more worried those noises were rodents getting at my food instead. The wind was also surprisingly calm. 

I woke up pretty early and managed to get some coffee into me before climbing up the rocks again to catch the sunrise. Despite the site being kinda close to the trailhead, I hadn't seen a single person since I got there until that morning. A lone hiker passed by and didn't notice me on the rocks. I felt like a creep lol.

I ate breakfast, packed up, and headed out. As I approached the trailhead I felt relieved to finally get my first solo backpacking trip out of the way and I was honestly planning for more in my head. Near my car was a couple having breakfast out of their van and we struck up a conversation. They were super nice (even offering me coffee and a PB&J) and I hope to one day explore the country as much as they have.

I spent the rest of the day checking off one more hike from my ever-growing list and then trying to find spots from old photos. No luck there. I probably looked like a crazy person driving around the Hidden Valley area looking for a specific rock. Meh, a task for another day. I needed a shower and missed my cat so I headed home. As per usual, someone driving irresponsibly on the 62 highway almost hits me and that was the most dangerous moment of this trip.

Anyway, I hope this post isn't too long. I've read posts on this sub in the past that have helped build up my courage to set off on my own and not wait for anyone anymore. My hopes is that maybe this post can help someone else too. If ya'll have questions lemme know.",4,1740799540.0,womensolocamping,1,1.0,False

Stuck after losing 45 lbs.,"I (23f) have lost 45 since last May by just tracking calories and changing my eating habits. I was severely depressed and dealing with several family deaths of people I loved so much, it was a really low time. At my heaviest I was around 250 to 245 when I began and I'm currently weighing in around 202- 199. 

I have PCOS and I recently began taking some natural supplements for it that have been increasing my energy but mostly I still feel zapped alot of the time. I was working but with the support of my partner I have shifted to stay at home to focus on college and health. I'm not getting much exercise like I was at my work, however I plan to start taking regular daily walks between assignments and we plan to start rock climbing again once I reach 195 but I feel like I have hit a brick wall. 

PCOS has sucked, I'm tired, I'm bloated, I am HUNGRY and weightloss is hard but I refuse to throw in the towel. On average I eat around 1,100 calories a day which on normally consist of a orange, and some berries, plain Greek yogurt, black coffee, some animal based protein (mostly chicken), roasted veggies, and what ever else fits my budget for the day.  I break my meals up into smaller ones so that I I don't face to many cravings or crashes and don't eat past 5 pm. I don't know what to do at this point. Part of me wonders if I need to slightly increase calories of if maybe it is another problem altogether. 

Any advise help. I'm just so tired and need to get myself back in gear and steadily losing again. ",2,1740799540.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

well, i was taking a break and just standing, not busking, in front of a coffee shop that i have frequented for fucking ever. the owner (who is usually nice) comes out and was like hey there’s no busking allowed here (i already knew this, i’ve never tried to busk at this spot) and she was generally nice about it and didn’t say i had to leave or anything. i apologized and clarified that i was not busking, just taking a break. all seemed good and she left. i was just standing there talking to some guy (i also wanna clarify like i said that i come around often, and everyone knows im a busker including this lady so she is most certainly familiar with me)

i continue to stand and chat for just a couple more minutes and when im about to leave (which i was not originally asked to do), the owner comes out a second time all pissy saying “you HAVE to go. NOW. you aren’t allowed to busk, blah blah” raising her voice and being all stern with me like i’m panhandling and refusing to leave or something

i stay calm and tell her again, im not busking, and btw im barely even in front of her building so i just give this confused look and im trying to understand why the hell she’s acting like this. then she said “it’s the bucket”. ok, i think to myself, so i can’t sit in front of a coffee shop that i’ve patronized for a million years because i happen to be carrying a fucking bucket? i come around here with an instrument and a receptacle all the time… im just like ok whatever, it’s her joint she can run it how she wants and i leave immediately

but if she wanted me gone she could’ve said that the first time. it really soured me because that lady is normally pleasant and i’ve never had any issues with her or her business but frankly i feel really disrespected and unwelcome at a place where i previously felt at home

funny enough i was looking for a new busking spot and the shop literally right next door let me play in their storefront so really that lady did nothing because i ended up playing like 3 feet away from where she originally confronted me lol. anyway, that’s about it. otherwise it was a lucrative day. i am worried though because i really don’t wanna have these shop owners start turning against me

1j0pswm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1j0pswm/neither_rock_nor_stone/,Neither Rock nor Stone,"Rock and Stone fellow Miners. So, I'm not quite sure where else to post this. But I figured if no one else got me, my fellow Dwarves got me. This is a sort of PSA for any Dwarves out there who love both rocks and stones as well as their daily coffee. Recently, I ordered what I thought was going to be an amazing Valentine's day present for my wife, who has her own impressive rock collection. The present itself was supposedly a crystal mineral mug that was carved out of actual crystal and shaped into a mug. The link to both the home page of the website and the present follows:

[Mineral Crystal Coffee Mugs — Grafton Collection](https://graftoncollection.com/products/mineral-crystal-coffee-mugs?variant=46284476219611)  
[Grafton Collection](https://graftoncollection.com/)

Well, the PSA here is, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE. The gift was a complete scam. What we received was not anything even close to the advertised product, but instead was clearly a cheap 3D printed plastic knock off. My wife, because she is amazing, thought it was hilarious. I however, was livid, and since the company has no place anywhere to post reviews about their products (for obvious reasons now) I come to you all. Again, I know this isn't technically DRG related, but I think that SOMEONE out there needs to know about this company. And since this is rock and stones. . .you get it. Anyway, thank you for letting me rant, even if this will probably get taken down soon after. I'll have pictures to follow of all the lies and actual product. Rock and Stone Miners!

I have my first week of decants rounded up and reviewed - here are some thoughts. 

- *Diptyque Eau Delle EDP*  Frakincense pulls very rosey on me but enjoyed. felt like a warm hug from your cool aunt. Vanilla was heavenly once it opened up. Husband enjoyed. Longevity 8+ hours. Will buy a full size when I can. 
- *Brandt London Fog* Really heavy on the lavender and earl gray in the dry down. Took two hours to get to the milk and honey notes. Husband liked, but preferred Eau Duelle. Longevity 7+ hours. Didn’t enjoy enough to get a full size, but also not interested in many more gourmands. I ended up giving the sample to my coworker and she really liked it. 
- *Imaginary Authors A Whiff of Waffle Cone* I wish I tested this on the weekend. I feel like I’m swimming in a can of Great Value maple syrup. All of my coworkers have said I smell like brown sugar and cinnamon and oatmeal. I over sprayed one too many sprays (I usually do 4, and I should have done 2-3). Longevity: 10+ hours, potentially nuclear. I feel bad I wore this to get a facial. I’m getting the salt note in the second half and it’s making me salivate? Had to scrub my body three times to get this off. Wouldn’t even recommend to my worst enemy. 
- *Imaginary Authors Cape Heartache* I ended up really enjoying. I got a lot of the Douglas fir at first, but then got a lot of the strawberry. I’ve been eyeing this one for a while and I’m really glad I enjoyed this. Longevity may not be the same as AWOWC but not opposed to that. It seems to sit closer on the skin vs project more which I’m not opposed to. Longevity: 7 hours!
- *D’Annam Vietnamese Coffee*: smells like my favorite coffee shop, and like I spilled coffee on myself when I was in a rush. Projects, but doesn’t overwhelm. sits closer to the skin, but not in a bad way. I enjoy the smell a lot. Longevity: 6 hours. 
- *DS & Durga Burning Barbershop* this…was an experience. I smell the hay, my coworkers smell the burning oil. I thought I was going to get the aftershave notes a lot but have yet to get them and it’s an hour in. I didn’t get any of the opening, just the bottom notes. Wore down to smell like incense, which I really enjoyed. Longevity 7+ hours 
— *Diptyque Philosykos EDP* I really enjoyed the smell at first, but it wore off so quickly that I was so disappointed. I would have loved this to stay longer.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I genuinely don't get the hate for the Dodge Caliber SRT- 4.

Sure, the base Caliber models were crap, but the SRT- 4 version was great. It made the Caliber actually look pretty good, plus it came with a manual and made almost 300 hp from factory. It's pretty spacious, I can fit well being 6'5"" and I'm not too uncomfortable in the rear seats. It has a pretty big trunk, and the most bass I've ever heard in a car. However, it was a FWD, and the interior was full of plastic. But if you can look past those two issues, it's actually not a bad car. Mine currently has around 95,000 on the odometer, I and I have seen these get at least double that. In terms of modifications, you can easily make around 350 - 400 on stock internals. In terms of uniqueness, less than 6000 were made, so you'll probably be the only one with a Caliber SRT- 4 at cars & coffee.

they’re all jokingly flirty and brain rotten not like “skibidi! 🤓🤓” just like “6,7” or “Nice catch cheer!” Stuff like that. 

We’ve been friends for 6 months now and instantly clicked, 1 of them through mutual friends (Coffee) and 2 being through school volleyball (Curtain and Cans) and I really find them pretty and generally attractive both girls except for Coffee being a boy

And throughout our friendship the only reason why I RECENTLY found out they were in a relationship is because my friend, Cans scrolled through chats with Coffee really quickly to find a photo and some of the messages I saw were like all lovey dovey romantic and not platonic. The other half is Curtain just joking around and being more touchy with me like touching my butt which is all jokes and laughs ahahah and just teasing me and is touchy with Coffee and Cans too


So, when Coffee asked me I was ironically surprised even though I actually knew when we were having a sleep over during the weekends getting ready to sleep. It was like, “We wanna ask you something, and say you won’t get weirded out for real deaduzz”
I say I won’t since I really don’t give a darn and then Cans just says bluntly, “Do you wanna date all 3 of us.”

I honestly blushed so hard and was speechless and was touching my neck and just touching around myself when I’m embarrassed like I wouldn’t mind honestly ngl and im so glad Coffee said, “You can tell us when you’re ready, we can just move on from this if you feel uncomfortable.”

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

To my surprise, the strawberry subtly mellowed out the strong flavor, making the coffee smoother and slightly fruity. It wasn’t noticeably sweet, nor could I distinctly taste the strawberry, but it definitely enhanced the overall flavor in a way I didn’t expect. The result was richer, more balanced, and honestly, pretty enjoyable.

My Recipe:

Coffee: 22g medium-dark beans from Tulum

Grinder: Timemore C2 (18 clicks)

Steps:

1. Grate some frozen strawberry into the paper filter before adding the ground coffee.

2. Add the coffee grounds, then grate a bit more strawberry on top.

3. Brew with 4 pours:

First 3 pours: 75ml each, spaced 45 seconds apart (swirl after the third pour).

Final pour: 100ml, stirring clockwise and counterclockwise with a spoon to extract some more flavors.

This was a total experiment, pieced together from various brewing techniques I’ve come across online. And you know what, it kind of worked! May not be the best approach with swirling and stirring but hey, worked for me. 

Have any of you tried adding frozen or grated fruit to your coffee? Did you get similar results?

Next, I’m thinking of trying blueberries, apples, or maybe even grapes—I haven’t decided yet. But I’m definitely recreating this because it was such a fun experiment, and the final cup made for a great start to my Saturday.

You are an amazing lover. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it all week.

I'm not saying we should be together. But I want you to know that breaking up with you was no small or easy or trivial thing in my eyes. It was just so necessary. I was falling apart. I was breaking down. I'm still dealing with the repercussions.

OpenAI has enhanced GPT-4.5 with advanced emotional intelligence capabilities, allowing it to better understand and respond to human emotions with increased empathy and nuance.

* OpenAI says GPT 4.5 delivers a more natural conversational experience, with an improved understanding of human intent and greater emotional intelligence.
* The model hallucinates less and delivers more accurate answers than previous versions, with testers liking it for pro tasks, creative work, and everyday queries.
* It isn't a step up from previous models on math or science but does surpass o3-mini and o1 on SWE-Lancer, OpenAI’s new freelance coding task benchmark.
* Only Pro users and developers on paid plans can access GPT-4.5 immediately, with Plus and Team users gaining access next week.
* Notably, the API price of the model has been kept shockingly high at $75/$150 per million input/output tokens. For reference, GPT-4o costs just $2.50/$10.

**What this means:** AI-powered assistants may soon offer more human-like interactions, making them more effective for customer support, therapy, and companionship. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/28](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

1j0p6lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1j0p6lo/advice_needed_badly/,Advice needed badly!,"Okay so basically: 

3 roommates, roommate A, B, and me! All renting under a random landlord, however, roommate A has lived here probably a year-year and a half prior to us, and roommate B and I both moved in at the same time. Roommate B has the master bedroom/own bathroom and also pays more than Roommate A and I (who pay the same and share the same bathroom.) Roommate B is pretty irrelevant and chill, nothin to say about her.

However, Roommate A is CONSTANTLY on my nerves and I know a lot of the things I am upset over I shouldn’t be, but when it all adds up idk I’m at my Witt’s end 😭😭 need advice LOL!

She is very organized and clean, and I am not. However, I keep my mess to my room and am super anal about the shared spaces (because if I leave anything out for more than 2 seconds, she moves it.) I remember one time I finally had to send a text about it because I had a chapstick on a dresser in the living room and she moved it to the corner of the coffee table as a sign to take it to my room. It’s SO frustrating because she has lived here longer/before, 90% of the apartment is her stuff, I don’t mind most of it because it’s less moving out I’d have to do later, but when I have SUCH a small amount of space compared to her and we are paying the same price to some random landlord she is not associated to, its frustrating that I can’t leave a damn chapstick out. She does this constantly , and what’s making me write this is I just came home and she unloaded the dishwasher full of my dishes completely and put them all on the counter for me to put away, and I look in the dishwasher- SHE DIDNT EVEN PUT ANYTHING ELSE IN! Like girl I was at work sorry they finished before I got home!

She also automatically assumes she is invited to all of my friends plans (she used to be coworkers with one of my friends in highschool), but if I come home and she has a friend over she just pretends like I don’t exist. (Which I honestly don’t mind cuz I hate small talk but it’s just the double standard.) There was one time I told her specifically that she wasn’t invited (cuz we were pregaming at our place) because it was my friends birthday and he wanted to keep it small, and was really nice and explained it all in a text, and when I came home she was talking about what we were doing that night and I had to be like umm you misinterpreted my text.

Not only that…. But she makes me friends uncomfortable. She has no filter particularly when it comes to relationships/53xual stuff and crosses the line all the time. Honestly to me as well, and I just don’t know what to do. 

This one is a personal problem I know, but I am an avid Limoncello La Croix Drinker. I have like 5 a day. I know I have an individuality complex and I am working on it, but she all of a sudden started drinking them too. I even asked her, “have you ever tried literally any other flavor?” And she said no. I also made a cross out of one of the boxes for wall decor lol AND SHE ASKED ME TO MAKE HER ONE! It’s like girl first of all, ???? Second of all, it’s literally cutting a t out of the box. I’ve also been using a VERY specific colored and style of bag for my backpack/everywhere bag for as long as I’ve lived here, and just last week she bought the same one. What’s honestly most annoying about that is she left it out (would kill me if I did that) and I keep going to grab it thinking it’s mine.

She also just will ask for advice and I give it to her and then she will tell me I’m wrong then a few days later come to that conclusion herself. Most recently, she was sick and I told her I have emergen-c if she wanted any. She said that is pointless, and today she had some crazy juice and I asked what it was and she said it was some vitamin c drink to help her. I said “hmm, that’s why I told you I had emergen-c the other day.” And then she was like “oh I’ll have to look into it then.”

I honestly just don’t know what to do/say because I know a lot of it is me being un rationally upset, but I seriously just keep getting so frustrated and I feel like she is just on some high horse. I would love any help on what I should actually communicate to her/maybe how

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j0p21d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1j0p21d/weight_loss_without_fad_diets/,Weight Loss Without Fad Diets,"I search a lot and refer to websites, institutes, and research centers specialized in this field so that I can convey to you the real information, okay?

most of us have tried some kind of fad diet at some point. The ones that promise quick results but leave you feeling miserable and constantly hungry. And sure, maybe you lost a few pounds, but did the weight stay off once you went back to eating normally? Probably not. That’s because fad diets don’t work long-term.

So, what actually works? A sustainable lifestyle that includes real food, movement, and healthy habits. I came across some solid advice on WebMD website and wanted to share it in a way that makes it easier to follow. Let’s break it down.

# Ditch the Fads, Focus on Balance

Your body needs a mix of protein, healthy fats, and carbs to function at its best. Cutting out entire food groups (like carbs or fats) might show results fast, but it’s not sustainable and can actually harm your health. Instead, aim for a balanced diet that includes:

Lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu, eggs) ,Complex carbs (whole grains, quinoa, brown rice), Healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil), Lots of veggies and fruits for fiber and vitamins

# Portion Control is the Game-Changer

We’ve all been guilty of eating way more than we actually need, thanks to oversized portions at restaurants and at home. Here’s a simple way to visualize proper portions:

Fruit: About the size of your fist, Cheese: The size of your thumb, Meat/Fish: The size of your palm, Nuts: A small handful

Tips to eat less without feeling deprived:

* Use smaller plates to trick your brain into feeling satisfied.
* Pre-portion snacks into small bags instead of eating straight from the container.
* Share meals when eating out, or take half home for later.
* Order kids' meals at fast-food places to avoid oversized portions.

# Healthy Habits That Actually Work

Instead of following the latest crash diet, build habits that will help you lose weight and keep it off:

Eat a variety of foods – Include lean protein, fiber-rich veggies, and “good” fats to stay full longer.

Avoid bad fats – Cut back on saturated and trans fats found in fried foods and processed snacks.

Load up on veggies & fruits – Aim for 2-3 cups of veggies and 1.5-2 servings of fruit daily.

Move your body – Aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise per week (brisk walks, workouts, or even dancing in your living room).

Ditch the junk – Clear out high-calorie, high-sugar snacks and replace them with healthy options like nuts, yogurt, and fresh fruit.

Eat smaller, frequent meals – Having 5-6 mini-meals a day helps control hunger and keeps energy levels stable.

Fill up on the right foods – Load your plate with veggies, lean proteins, and fiber-rich foods before reaching for carbs and sweets.

Snack smart – Berries (like blueberries and raspberries) are low-calorie, high-fiber, and packed with antioxidants.

Avoid empty calories – Skip sugary sodas, fruit juices, and processed sweets. Go for water, herbal tea, or black coffee instead.

Weight loss isn’t about depriving yourself—it’s about building better habits that last. If you need guidance, talk to a doctor or a registered dietitian to find a plan that fits your needs. And don’t do it alone. Having a support system—friends, family, or co-workers—makes the journey easier and more fun.

Remember, this isn’t about quick fixes—it’s about creating a healthier, happier you.

Today I began trying to dial in [this coffee](https://valor.coffee/shop/freethrow) from a local roaster (was roasted Feb. 12th). The d40+ has grind sizes from like 0-8 with their recommendation being 0.5-2.5 for espresso. For my first attempt, I ran a cycle with the portafilter empty with the double shot option. Initially I was a bit concerned because when I went to remove the portafilter it was completely full of water and drained out once removed. However, I read up that that is potentially supposed to happen since there's no solenoid in the regular Bambino, or something like that. For grinding, I cut the difference of the 0.5 - 2.5 and went for 1.5 as my initial grind size and I used a 17.5 gram dose of beans. When I went to pull the espresso, literally nothing came out. Over 45 seconds for about a single drop of liquid. This made me think - ""okay too fine, grind courser."" and the same thing happened 'til i hit about 5.5 on the grinder, which is WAY outside what seemed to be reasonable, yet it was the only way I could get a reasonable amount of liquid to get produced. Even at this super course grind size, it still was not getting me a \~1:2 ratio out. All the way up at like 7ish on the grinder, where the grounds felt almost like gravel at that point, was I getting \~35g in about 26 seconds.

I am not really sure what is going wrong. It could be the machine, but I feel like it's more likely user error.

# [1.1] Lost and Fond

It all started with the simple suggestion to ‘turn it off and back on again.’ These words were uttered with the kind of reckless optimism that only exists moments before catastrophe.

\---

    Out of the night that covers me, 
      Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
        I thank whatever gods may be
          For my unconquerable soul. 

Floating in the void somewhere, or nowhere in particular, there is a ship. One built on a fallacious notion, an attempt to control something that was not understood. The people that built this ship called it Invictus, a name which as you will learn, is steeped in irony that is completely lost on it's creators.

The ship itself was an exercise in weighing ego over humility: a sleek, entirely metallic exterior that was overengineered in all the wrong places. This attention to all of the hopelessly ill-chosen details included a viewing deck with gold-plated railings, allowing the single passenger to flaunt the ship’s luxury while travelling into the unknown. To their credit, the Invictus was an incredibly *shiny* ship. Whoever said you can't polish a turd clearly never met the people in charge of detailing this particular vessel. Or perhaps they simply never heard the phrase before.

    In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
        Under the bludgeonings of chance 
          My head is bloody, but unbowed.

A ‘wormhole’ is an unusual name for a fracture in the universe that leads nowhere, as if the language itself was trying to impose meaning where none existed. The concept implies movement, an exit, a destination. Things that comfort those who refuse to accept that some doors do not simply open, and not all thresholds are meant to be crossed. The void doesn't invite exploration, but in their relentless pursuit of control they mistook the emptiness before them as an undiscovered frontier rather than what it truly was: a vast, silent indifference to their existence. Faced with a fundamental truth of the nature of their reality, their response was to hurl their self-importance and aspirations directly into the abyss.

    Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
        And yet the menace of the years 
          Finds and shall find me unafraid.

One might be surprised to learn that thousands eagerly volunteered to venture through the fracture, as if stepping into an unknown anomaly in space and time was an act of bravery. While the identity of who *exactly* the primary individual to step through the fracture was not known at the time, someone was chosen to be the ‘first’.

She was different, not that that was actually noticed by the recruiters, but she didn't see herself as marking her name in history by chasing a legacy. She had no delusions of heroism, and no need for grandeur. What she carried was something much rarer—the kind of purpose and certainty that only the doomed have. She was not naïve, and she did not rely of faith in systems that had already failed her. She held the stubborn belief that if humanity was to fall, it should at least fall forward.

She had laughed at the name when she first heard it, at the irony of it all. *Invictus.* Perhaps not because it embodied the unconquerable human spirit, but because it was a monument to the very thing they refused to accept. Over time, she seemed to find comfort in the sheer audacity of their attempt to conquer the unconquerable itself.

    It matters not how strait the gate, 
      How charged with punishments the scroll, 
        I am the master of my fate,
          I am the captain of my soul.

Her name was Amara, and she was now dead.

# [2.1] Below Notice

The system was designed in such a way that if it were to fail ‘safely,' no one would be made aware. And it did fail.

\---

Life, in its most stubborn forms, can defy reason. It can thrive under crushing pressure, extreme temperatures, and immense radiation. It clings to vents spewing superheated water, rich in minerals and laced with toxic gases—places where human understanding of biological persistence begins to falter. Scientists have named these organisms 'extremophiles'; but on a cosmic scale, they are statistically unimpressive.

Humans couldn’t help themselves, unable to resist poking these organisms with a proverbial stick, not out of curiosity but to see if they could use them for something. They set to work collecting, dissecting, modifying, and cataloging. Could they survive even harsher conditions? Could they be engineered into something useful? Could they, perhaps, make someone very rich? These were the important questions.

At approximately 75°S, 135°W, buried beneath kilometers of Antarctic ice, a small research team was stationed at a deep-sea facility perched on the edge of a sub-glacial trench. Below, hydrothermal vents bled heat into freezing water and fed organisms that had never even seen the sun. Above, another form of life adapted, not to heat and pressure, but supply chain failures and isolation.

Among the station's daily routines, nothing felt more stable than the arrival of a shipping manifest. A precise list, delivered like clockwork, documenting exactly what was expected. Reeve scanned the usual list of provisions and equipment, his eyes skimming over them to land on something unexpected.

Provisions:

* ‘Heat-n-Eat’ Meals – 450 units (Total weight: 250 kg)
* Powdered Milk – 10 containers (Total weight: 10 kg)
* Freeze-Dried Coffee – 20 canisters (Total weight: 20 kg)
* Peppermints – 6 packs (Total weight: 3 kg)

Medical Supplies:

* Antibiotics – 20 blister packs, 20 vials (Total weight: 2.5 kg)
* NSAIDs – 4 bulk bottles (Total weight: 2.5 kg)
* Sterile Bandages – 40 rolls (Total weight: 3 kg)

Equipment:

* Air Filters – 18 units (Total weight: 9 kg)
* Oxygen Canisters – 20 units (Total weight: 60 kg)
* Reinforced Tubing – 50 meters (Total weight: 80 kg)

Miscellaneous:

* Office Supplies - 20 pens, 10 notepads, 5 reams of paper (Total weight: 5 kg)
* Entertainment Media – 5 encrypted drives, 10 books (Total weight: 3 kg)
* Inflatable Santa Claus (Light-Up) – 1 unit (Total weight: 4 kg)

""One inflatable Santa Claus,"" he sputtered in confusion.

He began to sift through the delivery until he found it. Buried beneath the vacuum sealed foodstuffs was a full-size, self-inflating, light-up Santa Claus. While this could be a clerical error, or possibly a prank from the supply depot to send Christmas decorations in March, there was no immediate discernible reason for it to be included. Reeve flipped to the attached requisition form and ran his finger down the neatly itemized requests. Sure enough, *someone* had requested it, but there was no name attached and no indication of who thought that it was a necessary addition. He became visibly tense, clenching the clipboard a little tighter while cross referencing the manifest and requisition form. It was real. More importantly, **it was here.**

Reeve was not the type of person to overlook these kinds of details. He was not the smartest person in the room by a long shot, but he was thorough: the kind of man who felt that small mistakes would cascade into big ones if you were to let them slide or go unnoticed. He knew nothing of the research that was conducted in the facility, he was there for something he deemed much more important: **inventory management.** Stock counts, requisitions, and organization—these were things that made sense to him. If there was something arriving in the shipment that was detailed in both the manifest and requisition form, it should be *needed.* If something was not required, there had to be an explanation. He took pride in his ability to catch errors and to spot inconsistencies. That was his job, that's why he was here. Yet, against all logic, there it was. An inflatable idol of holiday-focused consumerism and seasonal obligation. Its blank, joyous expression a hollow sentiment to its own existence.

He rubbed his fingers across his brow forcefully and flipped back from the requisition form to the manifest. Reeve had a process: verify, double-check, move on. The Santa Claus was accounted for after all. Meticulously he verified that everything had arrived as expected. His eyes passed between the shipment and the manifest, checking off each item as he confirmed it. Once he had reviewed everything, he froze. The clipboard shifted slightly in his grip. He flipped back to the requisition form, referencing his own entries in the margin of the manifest and ran his finger slowly down the list and stopped.

Requisition:

* Requested: Freeze-Dried Coffee – 20 canisters (Total weight: 20 kg)

Manifest:

* Received: \[ \_ \]

His eyes lingered on the blank space next to the entry—a blank space where confirmation should have been. He sprung for the received crates of goods, passing through everything with a refined efficiency. **No coffee.** Reeve pressed his thumb hard against the clipboard, staring at the empty space on the manifest. *No notation. No backorder. No explanation.*

The Keystone shipments were perfect for a long time, no missing items. Then, small inconsistencies were starting to become much more common. First small amounts of lab supplies were not there, then a few boxes of sterile gloves never showed up. Now, 20 kg of coffee seemingly just failed to exist.

He closed the shipment crate and straightened his posture and was no longer curling over in unfettered frustration. He glanced towards the entrance to the station's common area as though he could see through the reinforced walls to the coffee maker. He then shifted his gaze to the mug on his desk, a constant companion in his life. **Tomorrow, it would be empty.**

Reeve tightened his grip even further on his clipboard, his knuckles whitening before releasing slightly, a sense of focus and concern took over his face.

""It may as well have been the oxygen tanks.""

\*\*\*

""No. I'm telling you, we didn't receive it! I didn't lose an entire months worth of coffee at the bottom of the ocean!""

{SYSTEM RESPONSE} ""THE DELIVERY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

""And what happens if something *didn't* arrive?""

""ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

""Yes I—"" Reeve clawed his hand down his face, grasping at his cheeks and eyelids. ""On arrival there was something missing from the shipment, the shipment itself *arrived*, not all of the provisions did.""

""THERE ARE NO DISCREPANCIES IN THE SHIPMENT RECORDS. IF YOU BELIEVE AN ITEM IS MISSING, PLEASE VERIFY THE RECEIVED SUPPLIES.""

“I did. It’s not there.""

""IF AN ITEM IS NOT PRESENT, IT WAS NOT PART OF THE SHIPMENT MANIFEST.""

""It **WAS** requested and it **IS** part of the shipping manifest! Just check your damn records of the shipment!""

""ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

Reeve sat still for moment, rigid, tense. The words from the automated system were entirely flat and indifferent. ""Are you even keeping track of what is going missing?""

""LOCALIZED FRACTURES REMAIN WITHIN OPERATION THRESHOLDS, AND ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCO—""

Reeve interjected, ""I'll take that as a no.""

""YOUR CONCERN HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. NO RESOLUTION IS NECESSARY. GOODBYE.""

He stood there still for a moment, frozen in disbelief. The communicator remained firmly gripped in his hand as though he hadn't decided if he was going to try again, to make them understand the gravity of the situation. His head panned towards the far wall where storage shelves lined the walls of the room. The shipments were always reliable and arrived exactly as expected. There were small discrepancies here and there—which were reported promptly, but nothing like this. What were a bunch of sleep deprived scientists and bio-engineers supposed to do without coffee? What was *he* supposed to do?

Some time ago, a Keystone team was dispatched to this facility to crack a hole in the surface of reality: a deliberate, ‘reliable’ shortcut. As per the protocol set in place, they performed their staged assessments, nodding at instruments they barely understood before attempting to break reality like a fumbling glass worker with a screwdriver. The problem with glass, of course, is that cracks don’t always stop where you expect them to.

The Keystone had always been vague on the details of how their system worked, but the basics were well understood: a new kind of shipping. One that bypassed borders, weather and distance itself. A modern marvel in supply chains, engineering, physics and consumerism; Keystone Direct. Packages and shipments didn't travel in space, they passed through a fracture and reappeared at a different location with the use of a targeted tethering device. In practice, it was a large electromagnetic rod shot into the fracture that attached to the retrieval node to be dragged back into existence with the same grace as hauling a tire from a lake with a fishing line.

Reeve wasn’t an inventory manager in the traditional sense, but you’d be hard-pressed to get him to describe his job as anything else. As far as he was concerned, his role was to track shipments, log the equipment, and ensure that the entire operation ran smoothly. The way the shipment arrived was irrelevant to him; and the research conducted at the facility could very well have been studying how paint dry.

He stomped over to his desk to sit and begin methodically arranging all the new paperwork. His general organization was the key to his routine, and unlike the world around him, his routine is something he could always rely on. The ice shifted around them, with massive formations melting over time and filling nearby trenches. Thermal vents boiled and volcanoes spewed into the surrounding ocean. The area they were in was not stable in the least, but until today, his routine was. Although a simple thing to most people, it was clear that the idea of no longer enjoying his morning coffee and the break in his routine was a heavy, personal loss to him.

While he remained silent, his intent was in his body language, and his thoughts written all over his face. Much like his own checklists, Reeve had begun to go through the stages of grief in the same manner he dealt with most things, even subconsciously he held to his process: verify, double-check, move on.

*DENIAL* 🗹

Surely it had to be there.

Smaller items missing are forgivable, they are easy to pass off as general human error: but an entire supply cycle of coffee?

He picked up the clipboard again. If it were missing from the shipment it would have been noted. Someone would have flagged it, the system would have flagged it. If there were a straw to grasp he would be holding on for dear life.

There wasn't.

*ANGER* 🗹

The clipboard came down hard against his desk, the sound echoing through the sterile air of the supply room.

How could they forget to ship it? The Keystone knew the station relied on these supplies, they weren't going to be able to put in another requisition for a month. The funding behind this project was already bleeding money at this point and didn't allow for unscheduled expenditures. No exceptions, which meant no coffee for a month.

He, along with the scientists and engineers would be at each others throats in under a week. They are already in a confined space, running on erratic sleep schedules, none of them kept regular work hours. This was essentially like taking the spark out of an engine and expecting their caffeine dependent brains to jump-start on sheer force of will.

*BARGAINING* 🗹

Reeve stood quickly and started towards the common area with clear mission: to procure any stashed away coffee and take stock of the situation. It wasn't normal for his counts to be wrong but it doesn't hurt to see if someone had a stash, deliberate or forgotten.

He targeted the corner shelf where people haphazardly threw things they had opened when their minds were too preoccupied to remember where it went. Old protein bars, a half-eaten and partially crushed bag of crackers, raisins dried out so long that they could easily be mistaken for pebbles.

Finally, there was hope in the back corner of the pantry, tucked behind some nondescript bags and shining like a glint in a gold pan—a coffee tin.

Reeve reached toward it...

*DEPRESSION* 🗹

...chamomile. Some disturbed individual thought it was reasonable to stuff chamomile tea into an old coffee container. It would be easy to pass this off as a misery-fueled delusion, but sure enough, there on the tin was the word 'Tisane' written in smudged marker.

His fingers drummed against the metal.

Coffee was fuel, momentum. Steeped flowers, at least this kind, were for people who welcomed things as they were during moments of quiet contemplation. They weren’t for someone staring down a month-long caffeine drought with the crushing understanding of what this truly meant: devastation.

*ACCEPTANCE* ☐

Not likely.

# [3.1] Empty Shapes

The first fracture was comparable to a hairline crack in porcelain: thin and easily missed. Once it spreads and begins to chip and break away at the surface, it becomes unavoidable. Its reality forever changed.

\---

Foster was a collector of items, favours, patents and people. If ownership was control, then it was the closest thing to certainty he had. He didn't know it yet, but this was the last day he would ever feel in control.

His penthouse, located high above a city he was not particularly attached to, served more as a display and storage for his acquisitions than a home. Rare artifacts, trinkets, and various collectibles sat in secured cases and drawers and were showcased within temperature controlled displays throughout. Despite the organization and museum-like quality of the apartment, it felt impermanent.

His assistant—an acquisition herself, stolen from a competitor who had dead-ended her in a position with no chance for growth—was waiting at the edge of his kitchen island as he emerged from his bedroom. Tablet in hand, she kept her gaze directly on the screen.

""Morning. Your legal team needs you for final approval on a settlement offer regarding a technology patent that you filed in '78. I've sent the details to you.""

Foster waved a dismissive hand as he approached the breakfast spread laid out on the marble island. “If they’re offering a settlement, then we can get more.”

Her expression didn’t change, but she adjusted something on her tablet.

""Your presence has been requested at a gala next week. Prestigious, they claim. An ‘exclusive invitation for leading visionaries.'”

Foster smirked as he reached for his coffee, “You’d think they’d recognize a collection when they see one.”

“Also, an investigative journalist is requesting an interview. He’s writing about the ‘hidden empire of intellectual property,’ his words. Wants a comment.”

Foster let out a gentle snort. “Flattering.”

“Shall I decline?”

He sat in silent consideration for a moment, but clearly trailed off. His mornings would usually start with him checking his portfolio, skimming through the latest legal entanglements of his intellectual property holdings and browsing a few auction listings. He woke up when he felt like it, not because anyone dictated his schedule but because the world operated at his leisure. At precisely the moment he would have thought to call for his coffee, he saw that it had already been placed in front of him. He didn't thank her but took a long sip.

His wealth was not built on effort, but on foresight. Knowing when to take, when to hold, and when to let desperation do the heavy lifting for him. Patent litigation had been his battlefield, and he had won by ensuring no one else could even enter the fight. He owned ideas and the right to profit from them, and that was enough. Some were acquired legally, some were not. If you were to inquire you would learn that he found the distinction meaningless.

A small but insistent notification on his tablet, the patent dispute. One of thousands, but the name attached to it was new. Unfamiliar. He dismissed it with a flick but frowned slightly as he took another sip. The sheer volume of disputes, legal challenges, and settlements he engaged with daily had long since rendered any single one irrelevant. That was what his legal team was for, but this one had slipped through and landed directly in his feed instead of being caught and handled.

An anomaly. A crack in the system.

Curated news scrolled across his muted television mounted against the far wall: another auction, an estate sale in Geneva, a small gallery in Tokyo unveiling a newly discovered piece from an obscure, long-dead artist.

The assistant remained hovering at the edge of his vision, waiting.

Foster finally glanced up. “Hmm?”

Her tone was carefully neutral. “The journalist who’s been trying to reach your office.”

Foster blinked once, slow. “Yes.”

He had no interest in talking to journalists, and he had less interest in discussing patents with journalists.

“Decline. Block.”

She paused. “They will write about you regardless.”

That was the thing about notoriety, it bred curiosity and scrutiny. A constant, buzzing noise of people trying to understand. But to Foster, people didn’t actually want to understand him, they just wanted to know where they stood in relation to his success. Why *him*?

“Of course they will.” Foster was visibly irritated. “Fine. Have them meet me in The Vault.”

The assistant hesitated for half a second before nodding and leaving the room.

He finished off his coffee and stood up. The penthouse was vast, yet meticulously arranged, every item positioned with intent. The rooms were silent but alive: automated systems adjusted the lighting as he moved, floor-to-ceiling windows tinting in response to the angle of the morning sun. He crossed the open space of his living area, barefoot on imported stone tile, and entered what most would assume was a private study. In reality, it was 'The Vault'.

No steel door, no tumblers or combination locks. Just a temperature-controlled room filled with precisely arranged items that mattered the most to him. Items so rare or so obscure that their value was dictated solely by his ownership of them: A pen once used to sign away a fortune; a non-descript prototype, the only one of its kind; a manuscript never published, its contents erased from history except for this single surviving copy.

Foster would wait here, if the journalist was serious his assistant would arrange a car. It wouldn't be long.

\*\*\*

The handshake lasted just a little too long. Foster’s grip firm, his smile still somehow welcoming, but controlled. Intentional.

The journalist rolled their wrist once their hand was free. “I appreciate you making the time. It’s not every day I get a personal invitation.”

“I like to know the shape of a conversation before I have it.” Foster motioned toward a seat with the effortless authority of a man who was used to deciding how conversations went. “And I’m always happy to discuss innovation.”

The investigator sat, adjusting their coat. “When your assistant said ‘The Vault’, I expected something...different.”

Foster smirked. “What were you picturing? Lasers?” His hand gestured his assistant to come in. ""Can I get you a drink?""

“I don’t know what I was expecting, just not this. I suppose that's intentional.” They turned their head slightly to the assistant entering the room. “No drink for me, thanks.”

""Two drinks."" Foster insisted. “Security isn’t always the priority, the best kind of vault is the one no one realizes they’re locked out of.”

“And you decide what’s worth locking away.”

“Curation is an art.”

“And ownership?”

They smiled slightly as they said it and began flipping through their notes. “This is an important point to touch on later, but what I wanted to speak on is not about what you collect, but *how* you collect.”

“You will have to be a little more specific.”

The journalist pulled a folder from their bag and slid it onto the table. They didn’t open it, they just let it sit there.

“I’ve been looking at some filings,” they said casually. “Licensing cases. Contested patents. Public records."" They leaning in and tapped at the folder, ""When you pull at the right threads, all seem to trace back to you. Curious.”

Foster glanced at it but made no move to pick it up.

“Patent law is complicated,” he said evenly.

“Oh, absolutely, and you’re very good at it. Seven hundred and thirty-two active patents.” They flicked through their notes further. “Not all for products, of course. Some of them are just concepts.”

Foster affirmed. “Ideas have value.”

“They do,” they nodded. “Especially when the world moves forward and suddenly the right idea becomes indispensable. Then everyone else is left paying for something they didn’t even realize was yours.”

Foster deflected. “It’s an investment, like any other.”

“A lucrative one I'm sure” they said while their eyes gestured around the room.

There was a small but noticeable pause as Foster leaned back, “If you’re looking for something specific, I’d rather we stop dancing around it.”

The journalist studied him for a moment, then sat forward slightly.

“You’re good at acquiring things,” they said. “What happens when something gets taken from you?”

Foster’s expression didn’t shift, but his fingers stopped moving.

A beat. Two.

Then, slowly, he smiled.

“That depends.” His voice was smooth again, the moment folded away. “Are you here to rob me?”

The journalist laughed, shaking their head. “No, I think someone already has.”

Foster’s expression changed, but his tone was light. “That's interesting. I’d love to hear more about this right now, but unfortunately, I have a prior engagement."" He stood. ""You can leave any information with my assistant and I will have my people look into this internally. If something *had* gone missing, I'm quite sure I wouldn't hear it from *you* first.”

They stood as well. “Ah. Of course.”

Foster gestured toward the door. “I’ll have my driver take you wherever you need to go. Feel free to leave your availability on your way out and we can discuss another meeting in the near future.”

They didn’t move just yet. Instead, they picked up the folder, flipping it open at last. A single page sat inside.

“Before I go,” they said, almost as an afterthought. “Would you happen to know anything about this patent dispute filing?”

Foster’s gaze changed, just for a fraction of a second.

“I'm sure you do.” The journalist smiled, closing the folder. ""I look forward to discussing these matters further at your earliest convenience. I'll leave my number.""

Foster watched them leave, the click of the door shutting behind them left the room impossibly quiet.

After guiding the investigator out, his assistant walked in the doorway. “Would you like me to—”

“No.” Foster waved a hand, cutting them off. “Not yet.”

He turned back toward the collection, his fingers ran along the edge of a display case as he passed. He barely looked at what was inside. He didn’t need to. He knew *everything* that was here.

Then, as he moved to the next case, something shifted, *not in the air, but in his periphery.* A flicker, like a frame missing from a reel of film.

He turned sharply.

A display shelf, it had held something. He knew the shape of it, the weight of its presence, but now there was only empty space.

Foster stood still. Slowly, deliberately, he stepped forward, as if proximity might force reality to correct itself.

Nothing.

His expression didn’t change.

His assistant cleared their throat. “Sir?”

Foster didn’t look away. He was still staring at the absence in his display.

“Pull the security logs.”

""Did you do your exercises?"" (from CBIT)

""What if you quit coffee? Just try!""

  
And my new fav ""You should really try quitting music and see what happens.""

We are religious so my parents keep telling me to get closer to God and pray more, etc. saying how it will help my 'condition'

  
It just makes me feel so broken...

  
Like, I am fine living with my tics, why aren't they? Why do they keep doing this even though I told them it only makes it worse. And I loooove my religion but the way they tell me to be more religious and closer to God makes me feel like I'm possessed. I can't say this to them straight bc they'll flip out but I was just hyperventalating (idk how to spell it) in the bathroom bc I feel so broken like my tics are 'wrong' and something to be corrected :(

I was just coming to terms with my diagnosis and now I just...sorry, I'm rambling, I need to cry

1j0ow6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1j0ow6s/my_hrv_is_terribly_low/,My HRV is terribly low,"I know everyone has their own HRV so we should not be comparing HRV between two individuals. However, my HRV is terribly low, my avg HRV is 26 (over the past 2 months I've had my whoop). The highest my HRV has ever been is 48 for 1 day. I am a 29M, 165lb, (15% body fat). I have been weightlifting consistently for 5+ years and I regularly do cardio but only 1.5-2miles tho because I am not a great runner. I drink 2-3 cups of coffee, but ive recently stopped having coffee after 6pm. I dont eat at least 3 hours before bedtime anymore. I average 6.5 hours of sleep and my sleep score is generally 60%. I work as a physician but I dont feel like im super stressed at work. I was taking ADHD meds but recently stopped to see if that changes my HRV, which is hasnt. I do feel more calm generally on ADHD meds anyways. I am definetely an overthinker and generally on the anxious side and have multiple things on my mind but I cant convince myself that its the solo driver for the low HRV.

And because of my poor HRV, my recovery is always crap, around 48%.

I would love to get some thoughts, especially from people who had super low HRV and how much they were able to increase it.

I miss my friend so much.   I find myself wanting to send you songs, to ask you how things are.   To see your smile.
