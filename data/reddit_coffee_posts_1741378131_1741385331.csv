1j61nny,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1j61nny/need_help_figuring_out_my_next_steps_cc_debt/,Need help figuring out my next steps. CC debt.,"I got myself into a situation with some credit card debt and I need some advice on how to get myself out of it. 

I’m a single 28F, have been renting for the last ten year (not looking to move anytime soon), and earn a 75K gross salary. 

Long story short, a lot of unexpected expenses have thrown me for a loop this last year and I’m struggling to keep up. My savings have been depleted and I’ve cut out just about everything I can to save and pay down my debts, but I feel like i’m just running around in circles… I currently owe just over 33k over 4 different CCs. (18k on CC1, 12k on CC2, 2.5K on CC3 and 500$ on CC3). CC 1&2 have only been open for about a year and quite literally saved my bacon given recent life events, the others have been my primary mastercard and visa that I was using to pay bills for the last 10 years. 

I bring \~4K I bring home net each month.

2.1K goes towards rent and bills (rent, hydro, phone, insurance \[home, auto, pet\] and subscriptions). Then on top of that, there’s groceries, pet food, gas, parking, transit, physio/medical treatments and one weekly coffee that I get with coworkers on the day we’re all in the same office. 

Once all this is factored in, the only remaining cash I have goes towards making the minimum payments on my CCs (about 600/month, which is basically just the interest i’m paying…) and I end up with about 10$ left to my name. I’ve yet to miss a payment on anything but I’m worried that I might get to that point soon. 

I’ve been as strict as I can afford to be, budgeting the heck out of everything, never eating out, cancelling services, saying no to just about everything and counting every penny and it is still not enough. 

I can’t seem to be able to make that darn 33K go any lower. My credit rating has turned to shit, (not that it’s ever been great because the only asset I own is my car that’s been paid off for a few years now…) and I’m losing so much sleep stressing about my finances. 

I’d looked into getting a lower interest CC and doing a balance transfer, but no one will accept me anymore because of my tanked credit score. I’ve talked to banks about getting a consolidation loan but the payments would be similar monthly to the minimum payments i’m already making so I feel like that’s not a great option either. 

Another thing I’ve looked into is filing a consumer proposal, but that also worries me. I’m not worried about my credit score because it’s already in the 550s so it can’t get much worse and I have absolutely no interest in buying a house or changing jobs. What’s holding me back is that I bank through RBC and my two biggest debts (CC1&2) are through them as well, so I worry that my accounts will be frozen and I won’t be able to pay my bills and PAPs once it would be filed. 

I also know I have a few more sizeable expenses coming up in the next few months (dog surgery and my sister’s wedding in the summer - one thing I absolutely cannot say no to.)

I’m stuck and I don’t know the best way to get out of this. I’d really appreciate any advice and I continue to research any more options that could help me out.

Please excuse the new account. I am an active redditor, but needed some anonymity! I need some outsiders thoughts on what to do. I've been trying to nudge/motivate my spouse to find a new job for almost 2 years. Am I out of line? I don't think so. 

For reference-
They make about 35k (a little over minimum wage). I make almost 60k. We both work 40 hours a week.  We both work generally in our areas of experience. 

My spouse is not happy in their role. They decently enjoy the actual work they do (and they seem to be good at it), but they hate the people they work with/for, and are very underpaid for the work they do. Considering their past positions, they are certainly overqualified for this particular position. They have held positions in the past that utilized their skill set better, as well as paid them more.  I mention this, because I *know* they can do better.

Knowing they are SO unhappy at work, I'm utterly shocked that they aren't motivated *at all* to find a new position that they would be happier in. I've tried offering to help update their resume, or look at job sites together. I'm constantly met with excuses. 

The other day, we were having a ""how was your day"" conversation and my spouse was complaining about something from work. (This is a very common thing). So I posed the question to them ""well, what *would* make you quit?“

They told me they wouldn't leave this job unless they were personally sought out for another position. They would not look for something on their own, as I had suggested so many times. They would only do it if someone came to them and said something like ""you should apply for this"" or ""we want you for this job"". 

This makes me really depressed to know that they have no ambition to make our lives any more comfortable financially. I literally cried myself to sleep. I'm shocked that they're so unhappy with their job, yet so unmotivated to make a change. 

I would LOVE to be more financially secure. We definitely live paycheck to paycheck. We can mostly afford our daily life, as in, we don't struggle to buy groceries, etc. We already do things to save money (i.e. making coffee at home, packing lunches instead of eating out). However, when an emergency comes up (vehicle repairs, medical emergency) we *always* panic, then have to use a credit card, or pay some other bills late. We currently don't have much at all in our savings account, and are unable to add to it. 

In my field, with my experience, I can take on side job/gigs to supplement my income (in addition to my full-time position). It takes a little work to find these extra gigs, but I can do it. Working these additional jobs is not fun for me, and I don't really enjoy doing it. But, I can, and do, for the extra cash. My spouse does not have this opportunity to make extra money, as their position doesn't allow for overtime hours or extra work. But really, I don't just want them to work more hours anyway. We're both introverts and really enjoy our free time in our home, together, and with our family and hobbies. I'd love for us just to each have
a job where we're paid our worth, that we are happy doing.

So now, i feel a TON of pressure for myself to take on more side jobs, in order to give ourselves more of a cushion. I'm worrying about money, bills, and how we are going to survive like this long term. I find myself looking for gigs to pick up, and grumbling at the necessity of that. I'm worried this will lead to resentment of my spouse, and I really don't want that to happen. 

Questions I know will be asked:

""Why are they in that particular job if they made more in the past?"" 

It was a necessity. They were out of work for a short time, and this position became the only job available. We had a long talk (multiple times) about how this would be a good position to bring a little cash in, while looking for other more professional roles. My spouse has since *completely* forgotten those conversations, and seems to have permanently settled into this job. 

""If you're so worried about money, why don't you get a different job that's higher paying?""

Valid question. I'm trying to retain my anonymity, but ill say this. I'm in a notoriously underpaid field (I.e. teachers, nurses, etc). But I've worked my way up and am actually in a great position right now. To earn more, I'd have switch to an entirely different role. (Similar to.... If a teacher switched to a principal position. ). Also, my jobs are contract based, and this contract won't end for 3 more years. ",1,1741385023.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False
1j61jch,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j61jch/aita_for_filing_a_complaint_in_person_at_an/,AITA for filing a complaint in person at an estate agent?,"Hello reddit. Throwaway account since I know a few coworkers use reddit and might know my account.

Recently, I (42M) have been saving up for a long time to buy a nice property across the country, and I finally found one that I really resonated with. It was perfect for my family, within our price range, and a good excuse to move out of my parents’ place. There’s just one problem though. It’s too far away - I have a well paying job as a geography professor that I just can’t afford to move away from, meaning I wouldn’t be able to keep paying for this nice place (as well as my contract that I signed upon being hired).

So… I emailed the estate agents, and asked if they could move the property from Livingston (Scotland) to Hampshire (England). In my head, this was a perfectly reasonable question. I imagine it shouldn’t be so hard to tear the walls down and reassemble them in the new location - plus, there’s a lot of space in Hampshire. It seemed like an easy feat that any construction company should have no problem with.

But… Of course, this apparently wasn’t viable for the agents to arrange, so after many weeks of waiting for emails, constant rejection of this idea, I thought that enough was enough. I called out of work, I packed some bags, and set off on a drive to Livingston, to talk to these estate agents in person. It was a long, long drive, but once I had made it there (despite my wife’s protests), I entered the estate agent’s building. After exchanging greetings, I popped the question; why wasn’t she able to arrange the moving of the property? To this, she very rudely groaned and rolled her eyes, and asked if I was serious. After telling her that I, of course, was serious, she sat back down and got back to work as if I wasn’t even there. This really upset me, as I had gone all this way, so I reached around and turned her computer monitor off so she’d focus on our conversation. This seemed to really upset her, however, as she asked very loudly what my problem was. After officially stating my reason for being upset, she told me to leave or I’d be escorted out.

To this, I threatened to call the police, but doing that only seemed to alert her colleagues, so I put my phone away. I wasn’t done, though, I wanted to know exactly why the property couldn’t be moved. I asked her, and again when she didn’t reply the first time, which resulted in her yelling at me to shut up, and that she had serious work to do. This really set me off, so I knocked a few things off her desk (only small things, like some pencils) and at this point, she had had enough. She said some horrible things to me, like insulting my tie (which I had bought for this occasion) and other things that I won’t repeat.

I was raised not to take abuse by anyone, so I retaliated by tipping her coffee over and raising my fist, to act like I was going to hit her (which I would NEVER do to a woman).

At this point, her colleagues stepped in and yelled all sorts of things before dragging me out of the building by my shirt.

All of this for a simple question that I’ve needed answering for weeks. All I did was ask - perhaps I came on a little strongly - but again, I wouldn’t dream of hitting her. I think they were overreacting, but my wife has told our children (F9, M11) to not answer any calls from me anymore, so she’s forced me to pay for a hotel room while she lives rent free in my parents’ house.

So, reddit… AITA? I really think this whole thing has been blown out of proportion, but I want your opinions.

so they’ve been hyping this thing for days right? ever since trump signed that bitcoin reserve order earlier this week, crypto twitter’s been losing its mind. “first ever white house crypto summit!” “michael saylor, brian armstrong, the winklevoss bros, david sacks the crypto czar—all in one room!” even senator lummis was supposed to be there but she’s out with pneumonia (feel better girl). i figured this was it, the moment the us stops screwing us over and actually lays out a plan. i’m glued to pbs news at 3pm et, trump walks in all smug, room’s full of bigshots—coinbase guys, microstrategy, even some of his world liberty financial crew. im like “ok here we go, gimme the 200k btc reserve details or stablecoin laws or something.” he starts yapping—“america’s gonna dominate crypto like we did the internet!”—and cameron winklevoss is nodding like he’s about to yeet “moon” tweets. then bam, 19 minutes in, feed cuts. black screen. i’m sitting there going “uhh what?”

i thought it was my internet at first—xfinity sucks—but nah, twitter’s exploding with “did it just die?” and “white house fix your shit!” some say it was a glitch, some say they cut it on purpose, and the tinfoil hat crowd’s yelling about anti-crypto sabotage. pbs just mumbled “technical difficulties” and the white house hasn’t said squat as of like 1:42pm pst when im writing this. 19 minutes tho? for a “summit” that’s supposed to change crypto? that’s not a whoopsie, that’s a “screw you” to everyone watching.

and get this—the 19 minutes we DID get? garbage. trump’s rambling about not selling seized btc anymore—ok fine, they’ve got 200k coins from busts, whatever—but nothing on how they’re growing it or what it does to prices. sacks throws out some “digital fort knox” line that sounds cool til you realize it’s meaningless. no stablecoin talk, no choke point 2.0 killswitch, no clue if xrp or solana’s really in the reserve or if he’s just name-dropping for clout. all hype, no meat. then poof, it’s gone. summit over? are you shitting me?

i get trump’s not a details guy, he’s all about the show. but this was supposed to be a roundtable with the big dogs, not a photo op. 19 minutes doesn’t even cover intros with that many egos in the room. reuters said saylor and zach witkoff were there to “talk trump’s vision,” but we got zilch. washington post called it a “victory lap” after biden’s crackdowns—sure, but you don’t crash a victory lap 19 minutes in. coindesk hinted the btc reserve was the focus, but we didn’t get past a teaser before it tanked. this wasn’t a summit, it was a hype fart.

the video feed thing’s killing me. if it’s a real tech fail, that’s pathetic for a white house pushing a “digital asset revolution.” elon’s out there slashing budgets with DOGE but they can’t keep a stream alive? cnn said it was a small 20-25 person thing, so maybe the feed was just for looks and they didn’t care if it died. or maybe trump got bored and bailed—wouldn’t be the first time he’s noped out early. either way, it’s a kick in the nuts to everyone who tuned in expecting real shit.

prices are tanking today too—btc’s off its post-inauguration high, alts are bleeding, the “trump bump” feels like a scam now. x is full of “crypto summit fud” memes and “19 minutes of fame” jabs. some dude on r/cryptocurrency posted “waited 3 hours for trump to say ‘bitcoin good’ then it crashed. thx don.” everyone’s pissed, and i don’t blame em. we got hyped for a moonshot and landed in a dumpster.

what gets me is the wasted chance. crypto’s a mess—regs are all over the place, banks keep debanking us, sec’s barely letting up on old cases. this summit could’ve been a signal the us is serious. instead, it’s a shrug. fox business says trump’s team’s promising laws by august, but 19 minutes didn’t sell me on jack. if they can’t run a stream, how they gonna run congress?

im not anti-trump or anti-crypto—i want this to work, im holding bags like yall. but today sucked. maybe they’ll redo it or drop a recap, but right now i feel scammed. video feed fail? trump’s short attention span? some wall street suit pulling strings? no clue. i just know i lost 3 hours and some faith in this whole thing.

anyone catch more before it died? was it a nothingburger or a sign of worse to come? lemme hear your takes—i need something to make this friday less shitty.

tldr: white house crypto summit was 19 minutes of nothing, maybe video feed died, total letdown. rant done.

He came up to me, complimented me, and asked me to go dancing with him sometime. He took my Instagram and quickly made real plans.

We went out a few days later, had fun, kissed at the end, and he asked me out again for Friday. That night, we went to a scenic spot, kissed again, and everything felt nice. Then he invited me to a museum on Saturday, which turned into coffee, a bar, and hanging out until late.

So far, things have been going really well—we hold hands when we walk outside, and he’s consistently making plans in advance. We’ve been on four dates so far, and we already have a fifth one planned because we genuinely enjoy spending time together. He recently invited me over, and I ended up spending the night. We didn’t have actual sex, just basic stuff and watched a movie, but we slept cuddling. Even though it was nice, I felt super anxious the whole night. My heart was racing, I couldn’t sleep properly, and I just felt overwhelmed for no real reason.

I don’t know why I feel this way. I’ve always wanted a relationship, but now that something is happening, I’m freaking out. Part of me is scared of getting attached because I have big plans (like traveling for a long time), and I don’t want to feel emotionally dependent on someone. Also, we’re both leaving the city in a few months—I’m moving back to my country (France), and he’s moving back to his (Germany)—so I know this has an expiration date, and that’s messing with my head.

Another thing is that I’m a virgin, and he once mentioned he wouldn’t date a virgin, then later said it didn’t matter but that he prefers someone with more experience. I don’t know if he sees this as something serious or just casual.

We’re going to a comedy club tomorrow, and I’m excited but also super anxious. I feel like I self-sabotage by overthinking, and I don’t know how to just *enjoy* things without freaking out.

1j610fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1j610fl/reasonable_doubts_i_have_in_this_case_issues_with/,Reasonable doubts I have in this case: issues with investigation and police narrative,"*Intro*

This might be a bit long, but I wanted to give some context. I decided to hurry up and post this due to all these new rules being put in place. Ideally, I would prefer to reserve my opinions until more information comes out, but I was asked to share my thoughts. If you‘re already convinced he‘s guilty, you‘re not interested to hear why I personally have doubts, this maybe isn‘t for you. You are welcome to disagree and express your views nevertheless.

*I am basing this on publicly available information, I don’t have any additional insights and information beyond what’s reported. I apply my own biases, way of thinking, experience onto these facts, so below it strictly how I view this case. It does not make me confident in either guilt or innocence, until further facts are presented I will remain conflicted on this, it’s just making me doubt the case. I can be easily proven wrong, if more footage comes to surface and I don’t claim to know what happened*. 

**Preamble 1. How police and prosecution can make mistakes**  
Prosecution often forms a preconceived idea of type of person who did the crime and make the pieces fit. In most cases it works well: husbands, wives, children, partners, most natural and obvious, they end up correctly identifying the suspects.

Unfortunately, in cases with heightened pressure and scrutiny it can lead to mistakes. *Once they form an idea, they can get too stuck on it and not conduct a full investigation.* They want to solve the case badly, they **get biased** and **ignore the evidence that doesn’t fit** their preconceived ideas, and admit the evidence that suits their idea **even if it’s questionable**. Sometimes (I have personally seen it), they are so deep into it, they will manage to ignore even the strongest of alibis.

This is not due to malice, but because **the pressure can be so intense**, and detectives aren‘t always the brightest pencils in the box. So when people say „why would police frame a rich white dude“, it‘s no necessarily a conspiracy, people can make mistakes.

*So in this particular case, I think they jumped to a conclusion very quickly and got sucked in.* As a result of this, they might have ignored other leads and forced the case to fit. There was a lot of pressure on DA and there are natural human tendencies just wanting to be done with the case, close it, get that bonus/promotion, reach their quotas, all of that leads to sloppy investigation. You probably had something like this too: it’s a *natural human instinct*, when things don’t fit, you just downplay it or ignore conflicting evidence. 

Prosecutors are lawyers like any other. They are not there to find the truth, they are there to win the case. Win-loss ratio matters to them, and they will do what it takes to ensure a win.

**Pre-amble 2: media sensationalism and police narratives**

In particularly embarrassing cases, police tend to aggressively control the narrative, often exaggerating the amount and (most importantly) the quality of their work, as well as the strength of their evidence. They want public to see them in a good light again. Especially NYPD with their budgets. Media wants a story with clicks, so they are happy to play along and conduct very little (if any) independent investigation. So we have a skewed picture in the media, but we have nothing else to rely on. You’ve seen how 4 fake IDs turned into 1, how fingerprints and information about money changed. So *view all this information critically. Apply a dose of skepticism.* 

*This applies to both police narrative in official documents and media statements.*

*Example:*

**Media and complaint reports the following:**

*“Stepping out of the Port Authority bus terminal late in the evening on Nov. 24, authorities say, LM took a taxi to the New York Hilton Midtown, where UnitedHealth Group Inc. planned its annual investor conference 10 days later.”*

**Reality**:

*“10:11 p.m.: The person arrives in New York City. He is seen on video getting off a bus at the* ***Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue.***

*After he arrives at the Port Authority, he takes a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton hotel and remains there* ***for around 30 minutes****.*

*After arriving in the city, LM* ***got a taxi and ""immediately goes to a McDonald's in the vicinity of the Hilton hotel****,"" said Kenny.*

*Around 11 p.m.: He takes a cab to the hostel on Amsterdam Avenue on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.”*

Wait… so he spends 30 min in McDonalds having dinner and police frame it as “casing the location”? If we have a look at the route, it’s clear there was nothing unusual about it. There are 5 McDonalds restaurants in the area of Port Authority Bus Terminal/Hilton, and he just went to one of them on the way to the HI NYC hostel (there was no particular deviation that demonstrates he was trying to be specifically near the Hilton).

**This is neither suspicious, nor incriminating, yet police and media frame it differently. But police might sincerely believe it i suspicious.**

[Port Authority Terminal, Hilton hotel and 5 McDonald‘s](https://preview.redd.it/6pwt5d8webne1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=458d7fd88ceb89b294f8c5a625051e3d7f92fb77)

**Part I. Police investigation — was it flawed?**  
What I observed over the course of their investigation is a rather chaotic, poorly planned work with seemingly little oversight. Police were following random tips and coming up with a number of bogus ideas, which are easily disprovable, but brightly demonstrated their lack of attention to detail. Examples are (and not limited to):

\- assumption the gun is a **veterinary gun/B&T station 6** (it’s absurd, because it *very obviously cycles differently* than what was seen on the Hilton video) - not only was this idea taken seriously, they maintained it up until the very end, and they travelled to Connecticut for this

*Kenny said the gun “appears to be a larger handgun,” but said they’re probing if it’s a veterinarian type of gun. “It’s a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches,” he said. “If an animal has to get put down, the animal can be shot without causing a loud noise.”* (Be fr, Kenny)

*“Investigators are eyeing a firearm purchase in Connecticut under the theory that the cold-blooded killer who* *executed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson* *may have used a modern version of a rare World War II spy gun, The Post has learned.” “One theory brought detectives investigating a sale of a gun that closely resembles the one believed used in the shooting to a Connecticut gun dealer. But the guy's purchaser has been identified and is not a suspect.“*

\- assumption **it’s a Citibike** (again it was very obvious it wasn’t one, yet they reached out to Citibike without having a proper glance at the footage first)

\- **57th street Subway exit** (this one survived pretty long)

*“Separately, surveillance footage reviewed by police shows someone who appears to be the suspect exiting the subway prior to the shooting at the 57th Street station, just blocks from the shooting scene. The suspect was spotted on surveillance footage about 5 a.m. Wednesday outside the hostel holding what appeared to be an e-bike battery.”*  
Not only did police **not review this footage properly** to identify it’s a **woman** and not a 6ft man, but they also did something I mentioned before. They have not excluded this footage because it simply wasn’t logical, they *invented a scenario under which this evidence is possible to fit their picture* \- they alleged that the bike was positioned near Hilton the night before and a person travelled with e-bike battery on a Subway (*despite the person exiting it not carrying any batteries*) - clear example of fitting evidence to a preconceived narrative instead of critically reviewing the footage.

\- **coffee cup** \- they say it is based on a footage, how well did they watch the videos before diving headfirst into the nearest trash?

*„Police recovered a coffee cup they believe the suspect discarded, based on surveillance video, from a trash can outside the Starbucks. That cup was dusted for latent fingerprints and has been sent to the NYPD crime lab in Queens for DNA testing which has been fast-tracked.„*

Okay, so now that we’ve established they weren’t the best, most attentive and clever officers, I will lay out my understanding of what happened: I think police **heavily relied on tips**, instead of doing proper video canvassing and of the area and independent corroboration of the facts. *My suspicions were further heightened, when police refused to* ***hand over DD5s during initial discovery phase*** *- could they potentially show this exact reality of overreliance on tips?*

Granted, video canvassing in Manhattan (despite the amount of cameras and even if a large team was deployed) looking for a person dressed like 50% of adult population is like looking for a needle in a haystack. But more importantly, even with 15k+ NYPD cameras present, **it takes a very long time, days and weeks…**  moreover they had to extensively rely *on civilian cameras* \- it takes **even more time.** Any private cameras have to be secured by going door to door, which wastes hours of police time with very little results. Don‘t believe me, here‘s what former NYPD officer said: *„It could take* ***weeks*** *to find and scrub through a massive array of video footage from all the places where the gunman may have traveled.“*

Time pressure likely forced them to simply go around the city based on tips, as seen in this report: *“Members of the public have flooded police with tips — many unfounded. Police searched a* ***Long Island Rail Road train*** *Wednesday night after a commuter claimed to have spotted the shooter, but they found no sign of the gunman.”*

Kenny later mentioned it himself: *„The police are investigating every “single tip” that is coming into the Crime Stoppers bureau, Kenny said. “As weird as some of them are, as detailed as some of them are,” he said, “we will vet and investigate every tip that comes in.”*

Tips are normal, but they shouldn’t become a basis of one’s investigation. Potential heavy reliance on tips and tunnel vision **is highly dangerous.** 

Why is reliance on tips during an investigation generally a flawed approach? If police receive a tip and immediately focus on a suspect, they might **unconsciously shape their investigation around proving the tip correct**, rather than objectively considering other possibilities. Some tipsters might guess or misremember. **I think this investigation might have gone exactly that way - shaped around their fitting tips.**

**A) So here‘s my issue #1: how did they find him in the hostel so quickly on the evening of the 4th?** police went to 2 hostels based on tips, not video canvassing. 1) They went there on 4th of Dec, it is physically impossible to complete video canvassing in that timeframe 2)The tip seems vague and didn’t come from a hostel directly, because they visited 2 hostels: Kama Central and HI NYC. „*The hostels were searched after police received a tip that the* *suspected shooter* *may have stayed at one of the residences, according to an official briefed on the investigation„*

Here they likely decided to check NYPD camera in the vicinity and found that footage near the FDH *at 5:35* and zeroed in on HI NY hostel.

[Footage from vicinity of FDH](https://preview.redd.it/33z3lid3ibne1.jpg?width=625&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=019b528b1c868e5374a3492b32ffd7083763953d)

*“Employees who work at the hostel told investigators they remembered a man who almost always wore a mask when interacting with them or passing by the front desk. That person wore a jacket that looked like the one worn by the man pictured in surveillance images released after the shooting, the official said.”* \-> Hostel employees don’t normally care or remember guests that well, and based on the text above, it does look like a generic recollection.

It is my suspicion, since police got a “suspicious” person with a fake ID (LM) who coincidentally left on 4th, as well footage of someone with the backpack at FDH, **they firmly decided that this must be it.** 

I am not sure they actually checked what he was wearing (they were pretty egregiously inattentive before). Additionally, upon seeing that hostel footage from 24th of November, they reported the following: *„The images show the suspect flash a smile, with a black mask — similar to the face covering worn by the shooter outside the Hilton hotel — hanging from his chin.* ***He also wore the same dark hoodie and gray backpack as the shooter****, who was captured in disturbing surveillance video calmly firing gunshot after gunshot at Thompson.“*

From then on, they released the picture with his face and **started framing the narrative around that tip**. Clearly, it was a different backpack and a different jacket. Overexcitement from the fact of finding a fitting suspect might have *overshadowed their thinking* and they likely *did not pay attention* to what LM was actually wearing/which backpack he was carrying, nor the fact that the images don’t particularly look like the Starbucks pictures. 

They might not have had **any additional footage** to actually corroborate their suspicions. Based on my research about the hostel, it doesn’t seem like they have cameras in the hallways (guests wrote reviews about their things being stolen and due to lack of cameras in the hallways) and they generally seem to be sparse around the hostel. 

There is only 1 camera at the lobby, which doesn’t cover the Central entrance. This is the one that got now famous shot of Luigi’s face. *He wasn’t wearing the grey backpack*, but the same black backpack found on him in Altoona.

[Now famous footage from the lobby of HI Hostel NYC](https://preview.redd.it/v7grkh1nlbne1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86b399ccfb11c9b0767275b1371e20145c4e1702)

There’s a camera outside the central entrance (he could have been filmed here, but not if he left via a back entrance)

[Central entrance and the camera](https://preview.redd.it/liexhcq4mbne1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31dbbd61e1bca31ee19f10faa59010b8d42510f3)

But no cameras I could find facing the patio or the way to patio, which is supposedly the entrance that was used.

[View of the patio \(back entrance\)](https://preview.redd.it/628zdt8embne1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58741f159a4c4c9df1aafc3b4c59848a0c8a0290)

Additionally, police **curiously reported the following**: 

*„Police said* ***he didn't leave the hostel*** *in the days before the shooting. He did not speak to anyone. He had two roommates.“*

From this I gather the following: 1) they interviewed the roommates and staff, they mentioned something about the mask wearing to police  2) I don‘t think it is likely *he never left his room for that many days*, I think based on this, and everything above, ***they MAYBE simply don‘t have cameras showing him entering and leaving via the backdoor.***  

*Therefore, I am not sure they actually have an image of person of interest (LM)* ***wearing that outfit with that grey backpack*** *leaving the hostel at that time.* ***I am not sure it exists.*** *Now, I have not stayed in this hostel, so I don’t know this for sure.*

So here are my questions for now, allowing me to doubt the case: could this person captured near FDH be leaving from some other place nearby (there are several residential buildings in the area which will have someone naturally use that road)? Why did they only check the hostels? Do they have that footage with the gray backpack from the hostel? Was he seen wearing it in the hostel? When exactly did LM leave the hostel?

So based on this, it seems that it is possible that identifying LM as a prime suspect came from his **“suspicious” behavior** (wearing a mask, fake ID) and **his check out date**, rather than actual footage of him with the relevant backpack and clothing.

**I might be wrong, but until I see proof, I am allowing myself to doubt the case.**

**B) Issue #2 arises from this:** after this momentous event, it seems they are following LM’s prior movements, identifying he arrived on a bus on 24th and making that comment about “casing” the location (the guy likely just went out to eat dinner at McDs).

**C) Issue #3: I strongly suspect that taxi footage came as a result of another tip due to hostel images of his face being released to media in the days prior**, rather than proper video canvassing post the event. In my opinion, they cherry picked this tip, because it showed the “right“ person with bushy brows and further confirmed their existing theory and feeding their biases.

They had the footage of maybe someone else leaving the park at the correct time. That person seems to be wearing a snapback and seems to be unrelated to the event at hand. How could they connect an incorrect biker with the correct taxi?

[Exiting 77th with a snapback ](https://preview.redd.it/d93pflufnbne1.jpg?width=829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f0e9526d0b3b096624033fbda545d108ebcdc3a)

[On 85th with a snapback ](https://preview.redd.it/umro3u9jnbne1.jpg?width=582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0679224fa7ebfda0b879baf9392cbffc9250c9de)

And why I don’t believe they found the taxi with video canvassing? They needed an exact taxi and the plate. Screenshot below corroborates there aren’t any NYPD cameras in the area where taxi would pick him up. Only NYPD cameras are equipped with technology to identify the car plate. Private cameras lack the technology or quality, there is no way taxi plate was identified *based on a private camera footage*. Following the path of a yellow taxi isn’t that easy either and also time consuming - they all look the same, there are so many of them at that time of the day, timing on cameras can be slightly off - very easy to follow a wrong one.

[NYPD cameras in the area](https://preview.redd.it/xu61gwssnbne1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=410504fca9819097312973a7d6ae38de90dbaaef)

Given the speed (3 days at that point) and complexity (generic taxi, lower camera density in UWS) there is likely little chance they could have gotten the plates from a video, it appears to me, that they might have simply gotten another tip. **This cherry picked tip likely only reinforced their preexisting beliefs, leading to an investigation largely based on tips with parts of the ”trip” not even being the right people and following the flawed logic.**

[Private camera #1](https://preview.redd.it/iiacqm9sobne1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ed34b2f6abbcabfd0f5b7b66a36930348586f50)

[Private camera #2](https://preview.redd.it/mdcf82auobne1.jpg?width=733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb1168b11c65b3881b1c54831edcdbde7a7fa2cb)

These 2 private cameras possibly later captured him walking up to the taxi: *“Video footage later showed him walking near West 86th Street and Columbus Avenue, before he hopped into a cab that took him to the bus center, according to Kenny.”*

The fact that they **could not locate the bike** tells me: 1) they don’t have the footage of LM dismounting and leaving the bike or anyone picking it up, therefore reinforcing my suspicious it is not solely video canvassing; 2) the person on the bike with a snapback is unrelated to this whole event.

What conclusive proof is there he even emerged from the park?

**D) Issue #4: post arrest shenanigans.** 

Only a few things to mention here so far, but namely - inconsistencies in documentation (I can somewhat forgive and excuse to a degree), not fingerprinting a defendant (not sure I understand that part), holding him in the correctional center and interrogation by NYPD in presence of Joel Seidemann (the prosecutor) in Altoona (an attempt to break him, but seems like an overkill of an attempt, why so desperate?).

**Part II. Complete police narrative of the case: lucky assassin and what he did.**

**In investigations, pieces of evidence should always fit perfectly** **together, forming a clear and coherent picture. If they are not fitting together, a good investigator would realize that they are on the wrong track. So these observations are mostly because to me it doesn’t seem like pieces of information fit well together.**

**1) first, let‘s put together how it all unfolded according to prosecution.**

*I will deliberately* ***ignore all things touching the timeline***, *because a) I will allow benefit of the doubt to prosecution (although I really shouldn‘t) that timestamps are incorrect; b) I don‘t want to continue beating a dead horse when it brings no new information/view/insights/opinions.*

LM presumably arrives to NYC wearing a **black backpack** (**backpack #1**, captured on the video from the hostel & later in Altoona) and a grey backpack (**backpack #2**, PeakDesign). He is wearing **Levi‘s military style green jacket** (**Jacket #1**, Hostel) and has a **black puffer jacket** (**Jacket #2**, Taxi and Altoona). He procures an e-bike in NYC (prosecution suspects he might have stole it). He also doesn’t really leave the hostel leading up to the event.

On that fateful day, he emerges wearing **backpack #2** and a **smooth black jacket** (**jacket #3**, Starbucks). He is also wearing a **balaclava** (or some black head piece).

[Image of the suspect in Starbucks, wearing the Jacket #3 and balaclava ](https://preview.redd.it/t16jez1xqbne1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0aa94fa0e55e98d2b265fcf1c8267aad174e0014)

After the crime, he ditches the **backpack #2** with ***yet*** ***another*** **Tommy Hilfiger jacket** (**jacket #4,** jacket in the backpack is not the one the shooter was wearing during the crime), ditches the **jacket #3** somewhere else, not at the same place as the backpack (never to be found by police) and changes into **another very similar black jacket (jacket #2)**. No one in Central Park seems to notice anything, no passerby’s or joggers see someone changing and throwing out the **jacket #3** and the **backpack #2** in 2 separate cases.

*„It contained a* ***jacket that he did not wear on Wednesday****, the day of what officials have called the targeted shooting of Thompson, and some fake Monopoly money, but no gun, sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News.“*

He also ditches his **balaclava** there (again, never to be found by police), puts on his **neck gator** and a **snapback**.

After exiting the park, prior to entering the taxi, he **ditches his snapback** (never to be found by police) somewhere and we see his **neck gator** on his forehead.

He then proceeds to take a route to a GWB Bus station, which has heavy police presence at the station, as well as 2 police stations nearby. The purpose of the route is seemingly pointless, as despite risking being caught due to heavy police presence, he doesn‘t pick up a backpack there.

[Police near the bus terminal](https://preview.redd.it/tv8o6garrbne1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1dae4229b7bebda32ffd4a1a894e239fcac439f)

While **it isn‘t impossible** that all of this happened strictly speaking, it does make me go a little „hm?“. Is this scenario likely? Is it natural and logical? Or is there a chance they followed the wrong person because a) they were sloppy and inattentive throughout, b) he was wearing similar enough clothing at the wrong time.

**2) luckiest assassin in the world? or a professional hit?**

*These are just my opinions. As mentioned multiple times above, I can be proven wrong, and I am not convinced of either. To preface - professional hitmen aren‘t characters of Bond supervillain movies. They vary greatly in skill, experience and background. They can be sloppy and mediocre, dare I say, like in every profession.*

a) **LM theory:** LM allegedly spends months on preparing solo for this crime, invests at least 3 total months. He gets a fake ID, pays cash, prints a gun. Despite investing this insane amount of time and effort put into this megaplan, **he still risks missing BT by going to Starbucks for a candy bar**. Months of preparation could have been undone for a little snack, had BT exited the his hotel 30 min earlier. *Would someone is his position really risk it, given all the time and effort spent on this?*

**Alternative theory:** To me it looks like the assassin knew exact movements of BT on the day by the minute and therefore wasn’t worried he’d miss him. This suspicion is further corroborated by a phone call at 6:30. No, it is unlikely he was pretending to be calling someone. It is more likely someone called the assassin informing them about BT being in the lobby of his hotel.

b) **LM theory:** LM is very lucky BT happens to stay in a different hotel, therefore giving perfect opportunity to shoot him and allowing his escape plan to work. *How could Luigi know about this? Who in BT‘s inner circle could have given it away? If you believe social engineering can help finding this information out - be my guest and prove it to me.*

**Alternative theory:** Assassin knew BT was not staying in Hilton, therefore expected to shoot him outside. This whole plan hinged on this knowledge being available beforehand. Had he known that BT would only be inside Hilton, he might not have been able to shoot him at all and get away successfully (security likely would have caught him).

This knowledge is privy to a very limited amount of people and could not have been available that easily (BT arrived on a private plane and had a private transportation to his hotel on Dec 2nd).

c) **LM theory:** LM is lucky to recognize a man he never met in person in the dark from the back *from another side of the street*. He doesn‘t hesitate for a second to shoot, despite it being the first time in his life killing someone, because he knows this is for sure the right person.

**Alternative theory:** it seems more fitting that assassin was informed somehow (break lights?) or knew enough about how BT will look on the day to act without hesitation.

d) **LM theory**: LM is lucky to appear on the opposite side of the entrance at 6:39, exactly 5 minutes before BT makes it there. 

**Alternative theory**: the person was informed via a phone by someone else when BT was leaving and when they need to position themselves.

e) *„Kenny also disclosed investigators’ thinking on the still-unidentified gunman’s motive during a huddle with reporters. He also noted investigators had “****no indication of prior interaction between the shooter and the victim****.”*

I find this part a little odd. Presumably, if it was a lone acting LM, he should have had *some* interaction to execute this plan. It is not necessary, but it is odd. (I think this is also possibly a direct hit against the stalking charges, if true). To me it seems more fit to an alternative theory.

f) I could include more on how I think the conduct of shooting itself looked professional, not with regards to his stance, but how there seemed to be absolute lack of nerves during and post-shooting, but I am fine with people disagreeing on this with me. To me it did not look like someone who committed this for the first time, it was done calmly. Someone killing someone for the first time, likely would have had a stomach churning and nerve wracking experience.

**Final question:** if Luigi‘s *out-of-the-world social engineering skills* are so masterful, amazing and he is easily getting insanely private information left and right, ***why even arrive 10 days in advance?*** *To practice an absolutely absurd route (which is not making any sense) 10 times, once a day each?* Certainly one could have practiced it in a much shorter amount of time, what was the point of spending 10 days there?

  
**Part III. My thoughts on the evidence.**

The main problem about sayin anything here is that I did not see any evidence, neither did you. So here I actually don‘t have much to say. While video footage shown, along with timelines, leaves me unconvinced, it‘s generally difficult to argue against hard evidence. BUT police can exaggerate evidence.

***1) Manifesto/Notebook***

People ask „why would police fake a manifesto/fed‘s letter, it is handwritten, they couldn‘t have faked it“? Well, have you seen it? Are you confident it is his handwriting? I didn‘t.  

*Aside from the issues I have with all the a bit too conveniently “perfect“ backpack evidence being there during his arrest (but never mind, I am not challenging that here), I personally find the manifesto almost too cartoonishly incriminating and comical. The content and the language seems strange to me, the first sentence doesn‘t seem very civilian-like. But ok, maybe this is just me.*

If we talk more objectively, I personally find it odd that the content was **rushed to be shared in media** on the same day, but **not given as part of discovery**. What‘s the reason behind the delay? I would understand if the delay was coupled with them not sharing anything about the contents with public as well (to leave less time for defense), but not this.

IMO, there might potentially be a problem with this evidence. Leaked versions might have been **paraphrased, selective or misleading interpretations** of the content. Maybe there are **gaps in evidence log** and prosecution needs time to explain them? Retroactively justify how it was stored and obtained? In this case, they might fear the risk of authenticity being challenged and stall the process to delay this fight. Perhaps notebook **contains contradictions and exculpatory information**? 

*My general take though, it seems to contradictory (extremely careless) to the nature of the crime, but this is not a proof of anything, just my hunch. For someone so meticulous and detailed, seems like a massive oversight.*

  
***2) Forensic evidence: fingerprints, ballistics, DNA***

I have mentioned before, it really depends what evidence is there and how it looks like. If it‘s just fingerprints and ballistics, well, they are not that „scientific“. There is no established standard on what‘s a match and what isn’t. How many stirations/ridge minutae need to match to declare „the match“ - every expert decides for themselves. So it‘s best to actually see it to be sure.

It is very unlikely they have full clear fingerprints - those rarely happen during an everyday handling of objects. Most likely is that they have partial and smudged fingerprints. Ballistics are kind of BS science in general, since a lot of similar models can result in the same stirations and marks. People were previously falsely convicted based on ballistics „matching“.

If they have DNA and they conclusively prove they picked up the right trash from their incredible trash diving activities, then it‘s very hard to argue. It will depend on what kind of DNA is there - touch or saliva. Saliva would likely yield a full profile, as it is a single source DNA. Touch might be insufficient.

**Part IV. Motive or lack thereof.**

I think a lot of people grapple with question „why“. Same for me. Why BT? If UHC is the problem, why did he not target AW? Did he really feel that strongly about healthcare? Were there other people who would want to target BT more?

While we can guess, in truth, there isn‘t one clear established motive as of right now. The back doesn‘t seem to check out, he never had any encounter with UHC, and „capitalist“ America just seems so generic. **He clearly isn‘t against exploitative capitalism when it comes to dining at McDonalds and Starbucks**, these are ***exploitative capitalistic companies*** too, which pay low wages, bust unions, have bad environmental impact, expand aggressively, not mentioning boycotts against them. Is he really that personally against exploitative capitalism?

  
***Conclusion: am I sure about anything in this case? No! But do I have doubts right now? Yes. It it certainly a perplexing case full of contradictions and very confusing information at times. It is this fact that lead me to look into it deeply. As the case progresses, hopefully things will become clear and a cohesive picture will form.***

1j60kco,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1j60kco/advice_on_reporting_an_inappropriate_much_older/,"advice on reporting an inappropriate, much older TA at uoft? POLISCI","hey everyone ! ive never used reddit before, so im not sure what the protocol is, so i'll just launch right in because ive been agonizing over this for almost a year and i really, really, need advice. this post is really long, but i want to flesh out everything in the story to get the best responses possible and eliminate any possible biases.

to set the scene: i'm currently a second year student double-majoring in political science and history. as required per my polisci degree, i took pol100 level courses last year and am taking pol200 level courses this year. because history's requirements are a lot more liberal, i am taking a 300 level course and a 400 graduate/undergraduate seminar. this will become relevant later in the story. 

as im sure you all know, only 1.0 credits of 100 level courses can be counted toward your degree. to fulfil this for polisci, i took pol107 and pol109. the TA i am speaking about TA'ed both these courses. i did some digging and i think he is still in the same position. 

i first met him in pol107, where he was my TA and i met with him in tutorial once a week, as usual. i dont remember much from this semester, but it was mostly normal. i thought he was the coolest person ever; he told the tutorial about how he'd worked for years as a corporate lawyer before pursuing his phd, and about his research that had allowed him to live and interact with asian rebel groups (this was so amazing to me. i am asian. this is very important). at the end of the semester (my first ever semester in university), he announced to the tutorial that he wanted to start his own political science club (i wont get into the details bc it might prove to be an identifying feature). i asked him to add me to the email list, as did a significant amount of other students (everyone in the tutorial thought he was the coolest person ever). 

he held group meetings (himself, me, a few other students) a few times over the course of the second semester, where we brainstormed and talked (legit stuff, he was always kind and brought donuts and coffee for everyone). the trouble started when the group really kicked off.

at this point it was (i think) around march or april, and it was my second semester at uoft. i was enrolled in pol107. my TA was a woman, not him; but when she was handing back an essay, she told my tutorial that she was unable to mark around half of the essays, and that she had had help from another TA in the course. she said, 'if you have any questions, please forward him an email.' that TA was the male TA i am talking about. this meant that even though he was not explicitly *my* TA, he had marked my essay and there was a significant chance that he could be marking my work in the future. this was close to exam season. 

after the polisci group club thing had fleshed out a bunch of the kinks, he hosted a first, formal, group meeting at his place (this didnt set off any red flags because i was stupid and a first year. now i think its incredibly strange for a TA to host a community gathering in his personal apartment). when i went to the meeting, i didnt see anyone i knew from my first-semester tutorial with him, even though i knew a lot of people had been interested. that had been very strange to me, but i brushed it off because there were a few first years present. the breakdown of the meeting was him, around 8-9 first years including myself, maybe 6-7 upper years, and 3-4 actual adults (his friends, or something. its not important and i cant remember). it was a really, really, casual thing. we all sat on his balcony and chatted and ate pizza. the most concrete thing that happened was a group discussion about research projects we were interested in. looking back on it, i now realize many of the first year students had incredible research proposals and a huge amount of passion. in comparison, this TA had been allegedly working on his phd for multiple years but barely had anything to show. 

at this point, i thought that he was just a really cool and kind guy, who was willing to help first years get a foot into the door of real research and opportunity. at the end of the meeting, when everyone was exchanging instagrams, i asked him for his. (looking back idk why i did this; but it wasnt like i explicitly sought him out; everyone was standing in a circle passing phones and i felt really bad that he was alone, and he was next to me, so i just asked him). i remember distinctly a bunch of other people asked for his, but he only accepted and followed back me and this other girl, also a first year. (i do not make this point to brag or to be egotistical but i do believe that this girl and myself were the prettiest women there by far. we are now close friends and we consistently get compliments on our style and way of dress. a lot of people have noted that our fashion is very similar, and its true, we have the same colour palette, makeup style, fashion sense, and accessorizing habits). 

during the meeting, he had a camera and was taking photos of everyone. we talked about photography, as im interested too. at the end of the meeting, i snapped a shot of him and his dog sitting on the stairs and told him i would send it to him (this wasnt a weird or private thing; his dog is genuinely amazingly well trained and *everyone* played with the pup. additionally i took a photo while i stood in the foyer, with like 10 other people. they all noticed me take the photo; it was not anything akin to a private moment between me and him). 

id texted his number once previously to let him know that i would be a little late to the group meeting at his place. it was to this number that i sent the photo (i prefaced this by saying that my computer was dead and i did not have access to SLACK, a professional messaging platform). i understand that this behaviour is both informal and casual. nonetheless i had thought that we were friendly (in a normal sort of way).

the next day he texted me, on instagram at 10:57 pm: 'How's it going ?' i thought this was weird and brushed it away by responding, 'pretty good thanks for asking! how about you?!' to this he responded, 'Not bad not bad / Just thinking what's the best use of 43 mins that I have left of today / I saw some of your stories - you have a taste for life' . 

Over the next few weeks we would have casual conversation on instagram. not once did i ever text him first. he sent me a post from a photography account, on teen girls and their bedrooms; he said it was an interesting take on 'japanese cuteness'. all of these girls had the same haircut, a bob and bangs, which was the exact haircut i had at the time. he said when thinking of the girls, it was 'sexy in a way'. he also asked me how many male or female friends i had, and when i asked him in a separate convo if he was gay (i saw that he had posted a photo from a pride event a few years back and was really, really, hoping i was just being paranoid), he said, 'oh boy' followed by 'im just a sensitive poetic gentle and kind hetero' . he was so incredibly weird in every single conversation, but i was terrified of being rude, cold, or dry as there was a large chance he would mark my exam. he also told me about how he was depressed and wanted to end everything (suicide). 

i carried on our relationship until after i wrote my exam because, if he did mark it, i didnt want him to give me a horrible mark because he felt rejected. i also felt extremely conflicted about the club; i really wanted the connections it offered and the opportunity to research, but i didnt like that he clearly handed me the opportunity because he just had an asian fetish (later on i learned every single one of his past girlfriends were asian). 

i eventually decided on leaving the club and leaving him behind. i deal with a *lot* in my life, and i just didnt have the energy to pursue this.

skip forward to now. im older now, more confident, more secure. im thinking about filing a report against him for a few reasons. 1) even though im not really in contact with him anymore, i know a girl who has him as her TA who has confirmed that he is still as weird and predatory as ever. 2) he either mostly or exclusively TA's for first year classes, which allows him contact with girls who are fresh out of high school, new to university, and dont feel comfortable speaking up. 3) i know he went on a (i think fully funded) research trip to asia this past summer with *three female asian undergraduate second year students* \- *nineteen year old girls* \- and i feel so uncomfortable thinking about the fact that this could happen again. 4) even though im not in contact, the experience with him has genuinely affected me as a person. im outspoken, loud, and confident, but around male professors and TAs im now, forgive me for the metaphor, like a quivering fucking mouse. my voice shakes when i talk, i cant hold eye contact, and im in fight or flight mode. this is very fucking inconvenient because, in upper year history courses, students have direct contact with the prof. its so fucking humiliating to be unable to push out a single sentence without stuttering or look anywhere but my lap when speaking in fourth year grad-undergrad seminars, when there are only 15 people in the room, and when i *know* im a strong academic student and should be able to do better.

i am hesitant to report him for a few reasons. firstly, my cgpa last year was a 3.68. last semester my gpa was a 2.6 and i was forced to drop two classes. this is because my living circumstances have drastically changed in a way that i am unable to control. however, i am scared that the university will look at these two extremely different grades and say that i only got so high last year, in two of my classes, because he marked me. the classes i am taking this year are harder (note upper year history classes) but i do not think theyd care about this. i am scared they will remark everything i submitted for pol107 and pol109 last year, possibly bringing my grades lower, and flag me for an academic violation because i failed to declare a 'conflict of interest'. additionally, in our texts, he said 'good luck on the exam;) ' ; the winking face insinuates cheating. i think, even though i am a *good fucking student.* my grades this year dont prove this, and i will get in huge trouble even though i never asked him for help or any sort of academic advantage (i take pride in my work and would never do this). in that class, i had an A-, and the class average was a C+. i am terrified the uni will say i only got my A because of him. 

i am also applying to the jackson scholars in residence program. to me this is not just a scholarship. my living situation right now is fucking awful, and this scholarship provides a month of free, on campus housing. it would improve my living situation immeasurably, and i am so so so desperate for this. if i report my TA and it becomes a thing, would it affect my scholarship application and chances of getting in? 

additionally, im pretty sure this TA is generally well liked. despite the fact that he responded to my instagram story of a selfie with a link to a YT music video to a song titled 'Lucky Man', i believe he has won TA teaching awards. because he is 39 years old i believe he is friends with a few professors. 

i am willing to turn over every text conversation ive had with this man and speak on my experiences. however, im scared that his past experience as a lawyer means that i will be bringing something massive down on my ass (what if he sues me for defamation or something???) i also do not ever want to be trapped in a room with him ever again. i also *cannot* have this affect my scholarship application, or my academic standing at uoft. if this allegation is found to be false, i'll most likely face punitive measures. nothing physical happened between me and him because ive had a lot of past experiences with sexual assault and i am well versed in the signs and protecting myself. nonetheless i feel like a lot of first year students do not have an extensive history of abuse like i do, and would find it much harder to extricate themselves from such a situation. i care about what happened between me and him, of course, but im more worried about the many other girls he could be preying on as a first year TA. 

what do i do? do i report him, or just let everything fall under the rug? i genuinely, genuinely, need your help. im so sorry that this message has been so long, and if youve read all the way, i cant thank you enough. id really appreciate you sharing this post around so that it gains traction. additionally, if you are, or know someone that is, a uoft faculty member or even just well versed in the uni, your advice more than anyone is appreciated more than you know. thank you again, in advance, for everything.

I booked unexpectedly late due to extenuating circumstances, but at least a month in advance. Nearly everything was booked so I had to get the king bay view suite as the cheapest option. Definitely more than I anticipated spending but I haven't vacationed for 3 years and last year was extraordinarily rough, so it's my treat to myself. 


The suite at first glance looks great and is way bigger than I expected. However... 

(Note that I took pictures of everything first)


Standard Pricing: $330/night average for regular room; $430/night average for the suite I picked. (I paid more due to whatever is happening this week but not by too much)

Size: 560sqft/50sqm


* Dirty room: Obvious spill stains on the tables which wiped off instantly, every bathing towel was dirty (makeup, light orange stains, and certain parts smelled mustier than the rest), spots on the toilet lid and seat (and hair+dust in the back hinge part of the lid), shower floor grime, some small items on the floor from last guest (some obvious some less so). I would have asked for another room but they were sold out before I got there. I have a pet with me so I'm avoiding room cleaning for now. (yes I excluded the pet fee from the above price) I have disinfectant so I sprayed and wiped down everywhere. 


* weirdly minimal level of goodies in room including no toothpaste (that sucked after forgetting mine and having to brush my teeth with mouthwash) 


* Renovated in 2023 but still feels like a $150/night hotel: toilet and drawers slam closed (vs the ones that slow down before closing), hallway water refill areas filters need replacing (red light) despite a low number of ""bottles saved""), rough towels (even the clean new ones), mediocre mattress with a weird bunched up mattress pad, balcony door locks are old and broken so the door does not fully seal shut (noise + air leaks, a little more annoying when you want quiet)


* No room service: I found one site that at the very bottom declared this, but booking sites mostly did not (I'll blame myself here but surprising). They did give me $35 credits toward 1 lunch per day, which was a wonderful surprise after an extraordinarily bad flight experience. 


* Hot water/coffee machine doesn't heat enough for stewing or a cup o noodles (emergency snack lol)


* This might not be a regular thing but I think the fridge is broken. I haven't needed it yet but it's leaking inside and outside. (I'm going to call them about that after I get back to the room; I forgot until writing this)


~~

On the positive side:

* Food so far is delicious and you can get more than I expected with those vouchers if you're smart w/ the math.


* gorgeous bay view!! It reminds me of growing up near the beach in Fort Lauderdale. 


* Walgreens next door rocks. Surprisingly big with a large variety of different products. I regret packing some things. 


* very close to the marina for anyone doing cruise/boat stuff


* same day laundry for what seems like really small fees; haven't used this yet so I don't know the quality. 




Anything not listed I haven't had a chance to look at like the pool, but I do appreciate it's a rooftop pool because that's just neato. 



Is this usual for Marriott, hotels in San Juan/Puerto Rico, and/or hotels post-COVID?  Is it because of the size of the room? I don't have a lot of money to spend on these things more regularly.

1j609sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SportsBettingPicks/comments/1j609sr/looking_for_beta_testers_for_new_sports_betting/,"Looking for beta testers for new sports betting game (no entry, w/ $ prizes)","Hello!

My name is Ben and I’m the Reddit guy for [BenchBrawl](https://benchbrawl.com/reddit). BenchBrawl? Yes, BenchBrawl.

What is BenchBrawl? Why are you on Reddit? Why are you asking so many questions?

BenchBrawl’s a new, interactive, tournament-style betting game. You’ll compete against your friends (or, you know, strangers) instead of the book. Our “who” story is worth explaining in full, which is why I wrote 800 words on it below. 

But we’re all pretty busy, so here’s a TLDR:

* BenchBrawl is an interactive tournament-style sports betting game (yes, I know we already said this)
* Our unique scoring system is based on real-time odds
* We’re currently in BETA, BABY
* That means we want your feedback. Please. We want your opinion on all things BenchBrawl, particularly during our upcoming March Madness contest.
* About the March Madness contest: **it is 1000%, swear-on-my-mother’s-life free, and we’re even awarding $850 in prizes to the winners of our March Madness contest.**

Intrigued? Awesome. Not intrigued? Please don’t yell at me.

Even if you’re not interested in participating, we’d still be interested in hearing thoughts on the game below.

**Our Game**

BenchBrawl is a tournament-style, pick’em competition. In each contest, participants make a set number of picks. Nail a pick? Then you get a set number of points based on the fancy scoring system mentioned above. The Brawler (that’s you) with the highest cumulative point total at the end of the contest wins.

**Our Story**

Let’s jump in a time machine, shall we? The idea for BenchBrawl dates all the way back to…oh, just the 2023 NFL season. Anyway, our founder Paul and two good friends were looking pretty much everywhere for a tournament-style NFL pick’em game. If you can believe it, their options were limited. So, they took matters into their own hands.

They each threw in their weekly, uh, coffee money (about $50). They then made 10 weekly picks apiece from all available and officially posted Sides and Totals. They used a 2-0-1 scoring system for Win-Loss-Push (this is Goodwill Hunting-level math, I know), and they made 180 total picks over the course of the season. When all was said and done, the winner took home the whole $150 pot. I hope you’re still following along. FWIW, I have a calculator open to confirm all of these numbers.

Following the resounding (three-person) reception to the 2023 campaign, they recruited more participants for the 2024 NFL season. There were now nine (“The Wolfpack,” no one said except me) and they bumped the buy-in to $100. 

Those were the simple changes. Paul wanted to evolve the game, and that required a trip to his my Batcave (aka mostly Excel): 

* He wanted the game to appeal to both serious and recreational sports bettors. 
* He *needed* to adapt the game so it was more akin to sports betting. 
* He naturally wanted to add in Moneyline, and he wanted a scoring system that considered the vigorish (the bookmaker’s brokerage fee, which me and my homies call the juice, or vig).

Guess what happened. Paul redid the scoring system, dove into some sweet Excel formulas, and launched the revamped game for the 2024 NFL season. Everyone LOVED IT.

Guess what else happened (I suggest playing [Battle Hymn of the Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQcy8xktas) while reading the following paragraph). Paul realized this game could appeal to an even bigger group of people. Paul realized that for a small risk, a player could enjoy the fun and excitement of sports betting without losing the, uh, coffee money. Paul realized this approach made each NFL week more engaging and fun.

Oh yea, sports betting was also legalized. This meant there was a now-legal opening for a one-of-a-kind sports game that’s one half sports betting, one half Daily Fantasy Sports, and one half community (don’t check my math there).

Paul quickly formed his Justice League. Superman is a very talented web developer. The duo adapted that fancy Excel sheet into what we’re passing along today: BenchBrawl. The rules are the same, the games are live, and the odds now come directly from a real sportsbook and update every 30 seconds! 

**Our Request**

Come play with us. 

Okay, maybe that sounded creepy. *Please*, come play with us. We’re confident you’ll like it.

Yes, there’s something in it for us. We really, really want your feedback. We want your thoughts on anything and everything: the game, the UI, the presentation, how the Reddit guy is starting to ramble…we want it all.

We truly understand and appreciate that your betting bandwidth is limited. While this contest is **free to participate,** we will still be **awarding $850 in prizes, including $500 to the overall winner.**

Phew, okay, I’m done. What do you think?

If you don’t need any more convincing. Follow [this link](https://benchbrawl.com/reddit) to jump into the free March Madness contest. Can’t wait to try it out? There’s a shorter competition this weekend that you can jump right into to get your feet wet.

I’ll be popping in and out to answer any questions.

Im looking for buying advice for baskets (58mm - LM Linea Micra).
I like medium to light roasts, but oftentimes double shots are too much caffeine for me.

I'm looking for a fusion to save coffee but dont compromise the extraction quality. 
I found recommendations for the LM1 but also the IMS competition baskets.

I got multiple questions:
- Can you tell the difference between the quality of the IMS competition 24,5mm (14-18g) vs 26,5mm (16-20g)?
- is there a superior choice to them?
- Do they taste better than the LM 14g basket?
- is the ""classical"" LM1 Basket really comparable to a double shot flavour? I really dislike the single shot extraction quality?

Examples from when I was helping my friend in her booth at an antique mall:

1. I was putting up sale signs in her booth and another dealer sauntered over to read the signs. He had to say “I’m just reading the sign to see how much discount she is offering.”  

He wasn’t in my personal space or anything like that and it was obvious that he was reading the sign and I didn’t ask him what he was doing.

2. I was going through a set of keys to see which ones work in some glass cases and customer had to keep commenting about how many keys there were and how hard it must be to keep up with them all. 

She had to sigh, grunt or laugh nervously every time a key didn’t fit the lock and she almost broke into applause when one worked. 

Also, Boomers often announce their intentions to me like “I’m just going to sit over here” or “I’m waiting for my coffee.” When they are obviously waiting for their coffee at the place where one waits for their coffee, etc. 

Why arw they so nervous about what they are doing and what people might think. 

I mean, really, I just want to get stuff done or wait for my coffee order without a running commentary on everything someone else is doing.

But lately some stuff is starting to rub me the wrong way.

I just kind of laugh it off  and say ""no, but I've drank coffee every morning even in pregnancy, my doctor says it's fine"" she scoffs and says ""I've had 2 kids and never needed coffee"" and goes back to what she was doing. 

Then today when my son came home from school, both him and my daughter were sitting down watching TV and having a snack. I passed by and said ""MJ when you finish your snack please start on your homework I'll come help you after my shower, Izzy just watch TV until I come back okaay?"" They both said okay (btw son is 7 daughter is 3. ) I told my nephew to keep an eye on the kids while I shower. When I came back the maid(I'll call her mya) says ""hmm all you did was shower? That took a long time...also I can see who the favorite is"" and she gestures to one kid watching TV and the other doing homework. All I say is ""I'm 9 months pregnant a shower wears me out, and also MJ is my little smarty he actually loves homework time"" and by then it was time for her to leave

She's made a bunch of little comments like this that ice pushed off but honestly, they're starting to make me a little mad. She's not in charge of watching kids or anything and her whole job is to clean so I'm not a huge fan of her comments Espically on things she dosent know about.

I am looking for one-of-a-kind, mind bending, immersive experiences. This can be anything and doesn’t need to be as big of a production as L&T: pop-ups, art exhibitions, events, shops, venues, cafes, whatever - just something that makes you go WOAH. 

I just got out of a 6-year relationship and while I’m holding up better than I thought I would, I want to feel alive again and regain some perspective. I’ve already booked Life and Trust and would like to find more things in that vein.

I bought some beans from a local roaster, theyre from El Salvador, and are a medium roast, roasted on 18.02.2025.

I had previously tried 2 different coffees from another roastery and had no issue making a good espresso with them, however i cant get these beans dialled in right.

This was my 7th cup, i use 15g of coffee per shot, I do the puck prep with WDT and i tamp decently hard. I tried different ratios, from 1:2 to 1:2,5. Also tried preinfusing the shot, from 10 to 30 seconds. Also i went with finer grind setting, from 30 clicks to 26 clicks on K6. 

What I found is if i grind finer, it help but not much. Preinfusion also kind of helped, but the best coffee i got was at 27 clicks with 30 seconds of preinfusion at close to 1:2 ratio.

Can anyone help me with this? Thanks for the advice, i could really use some guidance here!",2,1741380363.0,espresso,22,1.0,False

I hope to have food delivered, maid for cleaning, rent an apartment instead of buying but hopefully an apartment with good security and amenities-pool, gym (1BHK).  Lifestyle:  I want a comfortable lifestyle for ex. eat out couple of times a week,  coffee runs, workout (need a trainer), I'm pretty spiritual so India is a good place to find communities for that.  I do want good healthcare.  My money is in stocks in the US market and I am Canadian.  I'm hoping to leave my portfolio here and take out 20lakh a year (is this enough)?  At 65 I will receive another $1,600/month CAD from pension and such till death (not included in 6 crore). 

  
My question is if this is enough to have a good life in Pune or another Tier 2 city?  Most important things to me are life style comfort, nice apartment (hopefully in a gated community for safety and also because I'm a home body introvert so I don't socialize much) with western facilities, maid for cleaning,  I don't plan on driving but take and uber etc. and ofcouse health care.  I don't want to stress over money so I wanna be sure I am set before I quit work. Any thoughts are welcome.  Also, I'm a woman. I want to devote more time to my spiritual life/peace/meditation, health and appriciate my life before it's time to kick the bucket and possibly get back into Martial arts again.  

What are your thoughts and please share any experiences and if I should save more before making the move?  Plan for more than 20L a year? Recommendations on other safe cities are also welcome (no tier 1's please - Mumbai gave me anxiety when I visited lol).

Called the front desk of the Endodontist that I got this root canal done at and asked the lady if having cold/hot sensitivity after a root canal was normal and she said yes and that’s it. BUT whenever i look stuff up online it says this is impossible due to no nerves being left in the tooth. So what’s going on? I would say it’s coming from that tooth because I had very little sensitivity issues prior to this root canal and when the endodontist used that cold spray on the two teeth next to it they were like a 4/10 on the pain scale while the root canal tooth was a 10/10. This is my first time getting a root canal, I’m 21 years old and I paid $500 out of pocket for it and plan on paying $1200 or so for my crown because my insurance maxed out already so l want to make sure this is done correctly and I have very bad dental anxiety due to past trauma.

I've had mine for years and its been great for the routine drip, cold brew, french press that we make on a routine basis. 

About a month ago I noticed that I would tell the machine to grind say 6 cups of coffee and it would only output around 2.5-3. Not a huge deal, but strange nonetheless. I thought that maybe the burrs needed replacement, I ordered a new set and unfortunately it helped not whatsoever. 

I reached out to Breville, they said that at most it would be $90 to repair as it was out of warranty. Since that's far cheaper than a new grinder, I took them up on it. I sent it in, they said that it was a gearbox issue that needed replacement and I'd also need to pay $20 to replace the hopper that I shipped them as it was damaged in transit...$87. Fine.

They say, pay it and we will fix it and send it back to you. I pay the invoice yesterday (3/7) afternoon, got an email at like 6-7PM saying its shipping back from FedEx. Seems sus, but again, fine. Get it back today, the hopper has water stains from whatever, the lettering on the inside is yellowed from coffee staining...aka, NOT new. Grind some coffee to see if its fixed, call up 8 cups...output = 4 cups. 

WTF DID I JUST PAY FOR?! I sent back a nasty-gram to the customer service person I've been speaking too, im not sure if there was a misunderstanding with my paying the invoice somehow triggering it to be sent back and not fixed but effectively right now I've paid $90 for shipping my grinder to and from them for no reason at all.

Brewed this western style in an infuser mug at boiling, 2 rinses, 45s infusions


Aroma on this was roasty, but with a real barn floor smell. I've heard of this as an aroma note before but its my first time experiencing it. It did not seem like an appetizing smell.

Flavor started out pretty bitter and roasted, but not nearly as much as Alienist (which I really do not like). Wasn't getting too much else. But after a few more sips and letting the tea cool, I got some really nice sweet notes to balance it. I still don't quite understand how but it does give me the ""shitty diner coffee"" vibes that the tasting notes mention. Definitely benefits from 2 or even 3 washes, but I weirdly kind of like it, until I get too much aroma before a sip.

Overall I have no idea how I feel about this tea. The aroma is still not my favorite, but I've come around on the taste, especially accompanying heavy food. Definitely one that I'll need a few more sessions with before I decide if I like it. ",4,1741379968.0,puer,1,1.0,False

1j5zks7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1j5zks7/am_i_being_bratty/,Am I being bratty?,"Listen I'm gonna make this short. I'm an Arab teen. I don't have a car. I can't leave the house without a parent and both my parents work. My mom from 9-5 and my dad from 9-8. I hate being home alot. I've been home all week. And I've been asking my mom allllll week if I can go to the out. She said ""yes we'll go!"" So. Thursday, what happens? My mom bails and comes home around 10. Stuff closes around 2am mind you. I got pretty upset but then my mom blamed me saying I shouldn't have taken a nap anyways. (The nap was for 15 minutes and it was because I was tired of waiting.) So now I'm pretty pissed but whatever at least I'm going to out right? Wrong, my mom and dad decide last minute to change the plan from going to out to going to dinner. So now I'm having dinner and wasting my Thursday. Next day Friday. I ask them again ""hey can we go out today? Since I didn't actually get nothing done yesterday"" they agree but the yet again, late. So we get to the car and then suddenly my mom realizes ""Oh were out of coffee!"" And so we drive to some niche ass place almost 30 minutes the other direction. We get the coffee, and again suddenly my dad sees a store for safes. And since he's been looking for one again, we stop. By now it's getting pretty late so I'm just waiting hoping they just hurry the hell up. And so FINALLY were on the way out when suddenly my dad is like ""ohhh I'm so tired let's just cancel."" Are you fucking kidding me. I just wanna buy my cousin a birthday gift. Honestly I get that I sound super childish but when you have literally nothing to do with your life going out is the best you've got. So really am I being too bratty? Am I irrationally mad?

1j5zkj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsadvertising/comments/1j5zkj5/credible_sources_supporting_key_digital_marketing/,Credible Sources Supporting Key Digital Marketing Concepts,"# Advertising Metrics and Performance Indicators

Digital marketers rely on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), cost per acquisition (CPA), and return on ad spend (ROAS) to measure campaign success. These metrics each illuminate a different aspect of performance. For example, **CTR** measures the ratio of ad clicks to impressions, indicating how engaging an ad is to its audience ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=%2A%20Why%20is%20Click,important)). A healthy CTR provides insight for optimization (e.g. tweaking visuals or copy can significantly impact click rates) ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=%2A%20Why%20is%20Click,important)). **ROAS**, on the other hand, measures how effectively ad spend translates into revenue, typically expressed as a ratio of revenue gained per dollar spent ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=)). Tracking ROAS is critical because **marketing is ultimately a tool to drive sales, not just generate clicks or traffic**, and this metric reveals whether an advertising investment is yielding profit ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=,will%20hopefully%20further%20drive%20revenue)). High-tier industry guidance emphasizes that focusing solely on superficial metrics like clicks without considering conversion or revenue impact can be misleading ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=%2A%20Why%20is%20Click,important)) ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=,will%20hopefully%20further%20drive%20revenue)). Thus, advertisers today closely monitor a **suite of metrics** (CTR, CVR, CPA, ROAS, etc.) to get a holistic view of campaign performance and adjust strategy accordingly, ensuring that their efforts lead to meaningful business outcomes ([Advertising Metrics 101 | KARGO](https://www.kargo.com/advertising-metrics-101#:~:text=,will%20hopefully%20further%20drive%20revenue)).

# Automation in Campaign Management

Automation has become a cornerstone of efficient campaign management in digital advertising. Major platforms now offer tools to streamline and optimize nearly every aspect of ad campaigns. A Wall Street Journal report notes that **advertisers are increasingly using AI-powered tools to automate nearly every step in digital ad campaigns**, from budget allocation to targeting and creative adjustments ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Advertisers%20are%20grappling%20with%20trade,step%20in%20digital%20ad%20campaigns)). For instance, Google provides **Google Ads Scripts**, which are custom JavaScript snippets that can automate routine campaign tasks. Marketers use these scripts to automatically adjust bids, add new keywords, and perform other optimizations without manual intervention ([Google Ads Makes Automation Easier With Scripts Updates](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ads-scripts-updates/450199/#:~:text=bidding%20strategies)). This level of automation not only saves time but can also react to performance data in real-time (e.g. pausing underperforming ads or reallocating budget to better-performing ones). Industry leaders predict that the trend will only grow: by 2030, **AI “buying agents” could be directing upwards of 80% of digital ad spend** as marketers increasingly trust algorithms to manage campaigns ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAI%20buying%20agents%20are%20going,part%20of%20ad%20giant%20Omnicom)). The drive toward automation – through AI tools and scripting – reflects a broader push for efficiency and scalability in campaign management, allowing advertisers to handle large campaigns and complex targeting with minimal manual effort ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Advertisers%20are%20grappling%20with%20trade,step%20in%20digital%20ad%20campaigns)) ([Google Ads Makes Automation Easier With Scripts Updates](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ads-scripts-updates/450199/#:~:text=bidding%20strategies)).

# Budget Optimization and Cost Efficiency

Optimizing ad spend for maximum efficiency is a recurring theme in top-tier marketing analysis. Especially in uncertain economic times, marketers are pressed to **do more with every advertising dollar**. A McKinsey & Company article argues that rather than indiscriminately cutting marketing budgets, companies should adopt an “investor mindset” – **eliminating inefficient spend and reinvesting it into high-growth, high-return areas** to get better results from the same budget ([Cost cutting & marketing budgets in uncertain times | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/beyond-belt-tightening-how-marketing-can-drive-resiliency-during-uncertain-times#:~:text=We%20believe%20these%20marketing%20cutbacks,creating%20opportunities%20to%20rebound%20stronger)). This means scrutinizing campaigns to trim waste (such as poorly performing ads or irrelevant audiences) and reallocate funds to tactics and channels that show strong ROI. For example, if one ad channel has a high CPA (cost per acquisition), funds might be shifted to another channel with a lower CPA or higher conversion rate. The goal is to continually improve the **cost efficiency** of campaigns – lowering the cost per click or per conversion without sacrificing results. Indeed, rising costs make this optimization imperative: industry surveys found that **average cost-per-click (CPC) rates climbed \~20% in 2022 compared to the prior year**, squeezing margins for advertisers ([Cost cutting & marketing budgets in uncertain times | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/beyond-belt-tightening-how-marketing-can-drive-resiliency-during-uncertain-times#:~:text=In%20the%20meantime%2C%20marketing%20costs,obvious%20direct%20return%20on%20investment)). In response, savvy marketers focus on tactics like smarter bidding, audience targeting, and frequency capping to stretch their budgets further. By cutting waste and **concentrating spend on what works**, organizations can maintain or even improve performance while keeping costs in check ([Cost cutting & marketing budgets in uncertain times | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/beyond-belt-tightening-how-marketing-can-drive-resiliency-during-uncertain-times#:~:text=eliminating%20inefficient%20spend,create%20distance%20from%20their%20competitors)). This approach to budget optimization ensures that every dollar spent on advertising is aligned with business goals and driving as much value as possible.

# Industry Case Studies: E-commerce, Retail, and Services

Real-world case studies illustrate how effective digital advertising drives growth across industries like e-commerce, retail, and services. One striking example in e-commerce is the rapid rise of **Temu**, an online shopping app. The Wall Street Journal reported that Temu’s surge to popularity in the U.S. was fueled by its strategy of combining ultralow prices with an avalanche of advertising. In fact, the **China-backed company’s ascent as a top shopping app is “powered by its ultracheap goods and** ***billions of dollars*** **of advertising,” including high-profile Super Bowl ads** ([The Spend, Spend, Spend Strategy Behind Temu's Rapid Ascent in America :: Grabien News](https://news.grabien.com/wire-the-spend-spend-spend-strategy-behind-temus-rapid-ascent-in-america-1#:~:text=Feb%209%2C%202024%2011%3A00%20PM)). This massive ad investment quickly built brand awareness and user acquisition, demonstrating how heavy ad spend (with presumably strong ROI given user growth) can disrupt the retail landscape. In the traditional retail sector, other case studies have shown how businesses leverage digital ads to drive foot traffic and online sales – for example, **United Airlines doubled down on a major ad campaign during the pandemic and saw long-term gains**, illustrating the payoff of sustained marketing even in hard times ([Cost cutting & marketing budgets in uncertain times | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/beyond-belt-tightening-how-marketing-can-drive-resiliency-during-uncertain-times#:~:text=United%20Airlines%20offers%20one%20recent,number%20of%20passenger%20miles%20flown)).

Service-based businesses and small firms are also benefiting from digital marketing. **Small and midsize businesses, which often lack in-house marketing expertise, drive the majority of ad revenue on platforms like Google and Facebook by leveraging automated tools to run their campaigns** ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=AI%20tools%20can%20make%20a,tools%20over%20the%20past%20year)). This has leveled the playing field – a local service provider (e.g. a home repair company or a boutique agency) can use targeted online ads to reach customers in their area, guided by platform automation to manage budgets and targeting effectively. For instance, Google’s AI-driven campaigns and scripts allow a small business to automatically promote its services to relevant audiences without the need for a large marketing team ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=The%20tools%20can%20also%20help,Weide%2C%20an%20advertising%20technology%20consultant)) ([Google Ads Makes Automation Easier With Scripts Updates](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ads-scripts-updates/450199/#:~:text=bidding%20strategies)). Case studies across industries consistently show that when companies – whether e-commerce startups, retail brands, or local service providers – strategically use digital advertising (and base decisions on solid metrics), they can achieve significant growth in traffic, leads, and sales. Many **multi-channel campaigns** further amplify this effect; businesses running coordinated ads across search, social, and display often see higher overall ROI than those relying on a single channel, as noted by marketing research (multi-channel approaches have been found to boost marketing ROI by as much as 24% in some studies) ([Multi-Channel Strategies Can Boost ROI By 24% - Activate Marketing Services](https://www.activatems.com/multi-channel-strategies-can-boost-roi-by-24/#:~:text=Multi,successfully%20implemented%20such%20a%20strategy)). The takeaway from these cases is clear: effective use of digital advertising, tailored to the industry and enhanced by automation, can be a powerful driver of business success.

# Performance Trends in Paid Media Campaigns

Tracking industry-wide performance trends in paid media provides context for campaign results and strategic planning. Recent data indicates that **digital advertising continues to grow, but certain performance metrics are shifting**. For example, overall ad spending has been rising: U.S. digital ad revenues reached about $210 billion in 2022, up roughly 10.8% from the previous year, though this growth rate has decelerated compared to the unprecedented 35% surge seen in 2021 ([2022's strong digital ad revenue growth unlikely to continue](https://martech.org/2022s-strong-digital-ad-revenue-growth-unlikely-to-continue/#:~:text=Digital%20advertising%20revenue%20growth%20slowed,expects%20worse%20numbers%20for%202023)). This suggests a post-pandemic normalization where advertisers are still increasing spend, but more cautiously. On the performance side, **costs are trending upward** – as noted, the average CPC jumped by 20% year-over-year ([Cost cutting & marketing budgets in uncertain times | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/beyond-belt-tightening-how-marketing-can-drive-resiliency-during-uncertain-times#:~:text=In%20the%20meantime%2C%20marketing%20costs,obvious%20direct%20return%20on%20investment)), meaning advertisers are paying more for each click. Higher competition and factors like inflation and privacy changes are contributing to rising ad costs, which in turn pressure advertisers to improve conversion rates and customer value to maintain profitability. At the same time, some engagement metrics have shown improvement: one industry benchmarking report found that **click-through rates have improved in 91% of industries year-over-year**, with an average CTR increase of around 3% as advertisers optimize creatives and targeting ([\[PDF\] 2023 Google Ads Industry Benchmarks - WordStream](https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-LiQ-GoogleAd-Benchmarks-Updated.pdf#:~:text=,Page%207)). Conversion rates (CVR) and cost per action (CPA) benchmarks vary by industry, but the emphasis on data-driven optimization has helped many advertisers keep conversion efficiency steady even as clicks become pricier.

Another notable trend is the growing reliance on **platform algorithms for performance optimization**. Facebook/Meta’s and Google’s AI-driven campaign types often report higher raw engagement numbers (impressions, clicks) than traditional manual campaigns ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Event%20Tickets%20Center%20found%20Performance,he%20said)). For instance, advertisers using Meta’s Advantage+ or Google’s Performance Max have seen significant increases in traffic volume ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Event%20Tickets%20Center%20found%20Performance,he%20said)) and improvements in intermediary metrics like CTR and CPC ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Arm%20Candy%20initially%20spent%20around,level%20of%20control%2C%20he%20said)). However, marketers have learned that *more clicks* don’t automatically equate to *more sales*. As one digital agency observed after heavy testing of AI-driven campaigns, the tools **“improved outcomes such as clickthrough rates and costs per click, but… didn’t increase sales”** in some cases ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Arm%20Candy%20initially%20spent%20around,level%20of%20control%2C%20he%20said)). This underlines a performance trend: the quality of traffic and conversion ability are as critical as quantity. Consequently, **advertisers are focusing on end-to-end performance** – not just getting clicks, but ensuring those clicks convert to revenue. The overarching trend in paid media is toward **holistic performance optimization**: balancing front-end metrics (like CTR) with back-end results (sales, ROAS), while adapting to rising costs and leveraging automation. High-tier publications and industry reports consistently emphasize that success in paid media today requires continuous monitoring of these trends and agility in strategy, ensuring that campaigns remain cost-efficient and effective in driving business goals ([Cost cutting & marketing budgets in uncertain times | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/beyond-belt-tightening-how-marketing-can-drive-resiliency-during-uncertain-times#:~:text=In%20the%20meantime%2C%20marketing%20costs,obvious%20direct%20return%20on%20investment)) ([AI will soon dominate ad buying, whether marketers like it or not | Mint](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/ai-will-soon-dominate-ad-buying-whether-marketers-like-it-or-not-11741271386353.html#:~:text=Despite%20such%20complaints%2C%20many%20marketers,have%20embraced%20the%20%E2%80%9Cblack%20boxes)).

When it comes to enhancing your outdoor space, an outdoor patio furniture set stands out as an essential investment. Whether you're looking to create a cozy nook for relaxation or a lively area for entertaining guests, the right furniture can transform your patio into a stylish and functional oasis.

Choosing an outdoor patio furniture set involves considering various factors such as material, durability, and style. Popular materials include aluminum, wicker, and teak, each providing unique benefits. Aluminum is lightweight and rust-resistant, making it ideal for frequent movers. Wicker, often made from a synthetic blend, offers a classic look and is resistant to the elements. Teak, known for its natural beauty and durability, provides a sophisticated appearance but may require more maintenance.

When selecting your outdoor patio furniture set, think about the size of your space. A compact set is perfect for smaller balconies, while spacious terraces can accommodate larger groupings. Look for options that include cushioned seating for added comfort, with cushions made from water-resistant fabrics ensuring longevity. Don't forget to include a table; a versatile dining set or a coffee table can complete your arrangement and provide a perfect spot for meals or drinks.

Another important consideration is the seasonal climate in your area. If you live in a region with harsh winters or heavy rains, look for durable, weather-resistant sets that can withstand the elements. Many outdoor patio furniture sets come with protective covers, allowing you to extend their life while maintaining their aesthetic appeal.

Ultimately, investing in a quality outdoor patio furniture set will enhance your home's outdoor experience, making it a favorite gathering spot for family and friends. With the right selection, you can create an inviting environment that allows you to enjoy every sunny day and starry night in style.

## The ​Allure of Portable SSDs: Why ‌Choose Sandisk USB 3.0?

In today's ‌digital age, the demand for portable and reliable storage solutions is ⁤constantly growing. Portable SSDs ​have emerged as a compelling choice to conventional⁤ hard disk ⁢drives (HDDs), offering a range of⁤ advantages that‌ cater to ⁢the needs of modern users.⁤ Let's explore ⁤why a Sandisk portable SSD USB​ 3.0 might be the perfect solution for you.

### Speed and Performance

One of the⁣ most significant benefits of​ a solid state drive is its speed. Unlike HDDs that⁤ rely ‌on ⁤spinning platters and mechanical read/write heads, SSDs use flash memory to access data‌ electronically. This results in significantly faster‌ boot times,application loading,and file transfers. A fast external SSD can dramatically improve your ​workflow, whether you're transferring large video files, running‌ demanding applications, or simply backing up your data. Sandisk’s reputation for quality only adds ‌to the peace of mind‍ when choosing a ‍Sandisk USB 3.0 external SSD. Getting‍ it with free shipping under $200 from AliExpress makes it even more attractive.

Imagine a​ scenario where ⁣you need to ⁢quickly copy a massive video project to an external drive for editing ⁣on the go.⁤ With a ‌traditional HDD, this process could take a​ considerable amount of time, ⁤perhaps disrupting your workflow. Though, ‍with a Sandisk SSD deal, ‌you can experience‍ blazing-fast transfer speeds that significantly reduce waiting times, allowing you to focus ‍on what matters most: your creative work.

### Portability and Durability

External SSDs ⁢are designed with portability in mind. Their compact size‌ and lightweight construction make​ them ⁤easy‌ to carry around in a laptop bag or even a pocket. This is especially⁣ beneficial for digital​ nomads, students, ⁤and anyone who needs to access their data on the‌ go. Sandisk portable drives⁣ are built to withstand the rigors of travel, ‌making them a reliable companion for⁤ your adventures.Furthermore, SSDs ⁢are generally more durable ⁣than HDDs. Since they have ⁣no moving parts, they are‌ less susceptible to‌ damage from shocks and vibrations. This makes them a more robust‍ choice⁤ for users who⁤ frequently travel or work in environments where their storage devices might be exposed to rough handling.‌ consider the peace of mind knowing⁣ your valuable data ⁢is safer, whether ⁣you’re traversing a busy city or navigating a bumpy train ride. Opting for a reliable external SSD means‍ one less thing to worry about during‌ your travels.### Compatibility and Ease of Use

Sandisk USB⁤ 3.0 external ⁤SSDs ​are designed to be compatible with a wide range of⁣ devices, including laptops, desktops, gaming consoles, and even some smartphones ⁣and tablets. The USB 3.0 interface ensures fast data transfer speeds while also‍ being backward compatible⁣ with older ⁣USB ports. Most⁣ Sandisk SSDs are ⁣plug-and-play devices, ⁢meaning you can simply connect them to‍ your ​computer and start using them ‍without the need for elaborate ‌software installations.

### Why AliExpress for Sandisk SSDs?

aliexpress has become a⁣ popular online marketplace for consumers looking for affordable electronics and accessories. The platform offers a⁤ wide selection of Sandisk SSDs, often at prices lower than those ‍found at traditional retailers.​ Moreover, many sellers on ‌AliExpress⁢ offer⁢ free shipping, making‌ it even more‍ attractive to budget-conscious buyers.

Though, it's crucial‌ to exercise caution ‍when⁣ buying electronics on AliExpress. To ensure you get a genuine Sandisk product, ⁤look‍ for the Sandisk official⁢ store on the​ platform, or purchase from reputable sellers⁤ with high ratings and‌ positive reviews.​ Taking a few extra minutes ⁤to verify the seller's credentials can save you from potential headaches down the road.

## Sandisk SSD ‍Speed Test⁤ USB 3.0: What to Expect

We saw a bunch of people online and in real life, including the Alt National Park Services accounts reporting that they are looking into not paying federal taxes. 


Washington Coffee Party is not an established organization nor are we pretending to be. We want Washington to come forward and make Washington Coffee Party what they need -


A platform for petitions
A platform to organize protests 
A platform to ask questions that people get demolished on Reddit for asking when all you want is education 
A platform to feel validated that you are not going crazy and your government has turned their backs on you

Some ideas brought up -

Reframing language in petition about feasible next steps 

A workers political party

A 50501 workers union


We will be creating some additional platforms to create safe spaces for discussion. 

If you have had any ideas, please don't be afraid to post them here or start a thread asking questions. We don't plan on censoring but we do ask everyone to presume good intent in people's questions and be mindful of how text sounds. We all have different learning and accessibility needs. One thing I personally want to bring to this movement is ensuring information is presented in different ways so that everyone can understand and do their own fact checking work.

With her first swallow of coffee, she takes her daily medication. Her medications are safe to take because some stupid commie liberal fought to insure their safety and that they work as advertised.

All but $10 of her medications are paid for by her employer's medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Sue gets it too.

She prepares her morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Sue's bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry. In the shower, Sue reaches for her shampoo. Her bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for her right to know what she was putting on her body and how much it contained.

Sue dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air she breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air.

She walks to the subway station for her government-subsidized ride to work. It saves her considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.

Sue begins her work day. She has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Sue's employer pays these standards because Sue's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union. If Sue is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, she'll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn't think she should lose her home because of her temporary misfortune.

It's noon and Sue needs to make a bank deposit so she can pay some bills. Sue's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Sue's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression.

Sue has to pay her Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and her below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Sue and the government would be better off if she was educated and earned more money over her lifetime.

Sue is home from work. She plans to visit her father this evening at his farm home in the country. She gets in her car for the drive. Her car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards.

She arrives at her childhood home. Her generation was the third to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration because bankers didn't want to make rural loans. The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification. She is happy to see her father, who is now retired. Her father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Sue wouldn't have to.

Sue gets back in her car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. He doesn't mention that Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Sue enjoys throughout her day. Sue agrees: ""We don't need those big-government liberals ruining our lives! After all, I'm self-made and believe everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have.""",1,1741379322.0,dontwaltopeninside,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Looking forward to connecting.",1,1741379080.0,LetsChat,1,1.0,False
1j5zbkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1j5zbkq/am_in_overreacting/,Am in overreacting?,"I (21F) never really had a big friend circle, always single for life, just my girl best friend, everyone else felt kinda fake, so I mostly kept to myself and just waited for college to be over,

On the last day, I noticed this guy (24M) from another branch staring at me, he was super extroverted, laughing, talking with his friends, but every time I looked at him, he’d get all shy and look away, it was kinda cute, we had spoken a few times on WhatsApp before, just about college stuff, but I had no idea what he actually looked like, that day, he randomly asked me for coffee in the canteen, I don’t know why, but I said no, he just smiled and said maybe some other time, and for some reason, that moment stuck with me

That night, I saved his number and texted him, he replied immediately, and just like that, we started talking
It’s been a year now, and we’re in a long distance thing, he still texts me every single day, good morning, good night, memes, random updates, and me, I shamelessly ghost him, sometimes for a few days, sometimes for weeks, not completely, just enough to see if he’ll double text, to test if he still cares, and he always does, no matter how long I ignore him, he never gets mad, I don’t know why I do this, maybe I like the attention, or maybe I’m just scared to be too available
But he’s hot, like way hotter than I expected, and yeah, things escalated, we’ve sexted, exchanged nudes, all that, but even with that, he’s never pushy, always asking if I’m sure, always careful

He also keeps gifting me dresses, pretty, expensive ones, and I’ve never worn them in public, I don’t even know why, I told him I don’t need gifts, but he keeps sending them anyway and never even asks if I wore them
And the weirdest part, he’s told me multiple times that he loves me, just simple, casual confessions, I love you, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, and every time, I freeze, I care about him, I really do, but love, I don’t know if I’m there yet, or maybe I do know, and I’m just scared to admit it,

Once, he told me I remind him of his mom, at first, I didn’t know how to react, but he explained, it’s the way I care, the way I ask if he’s eaten, how I scold him when he doesn’t take care of himself, and that kinda stuck with me

And the thing is, I only talk to him, no one else, I don’t have a bunch of guys texting me, I don’t entertain anyone else, it’s just him, and still, I make him chase, I ghost him
I don’t know if I’m being unfair, or if this is just how I am, but sometimes I wonder, if we had met earlier, would things be different, would I still be like this, making him wait, or would I have just let myself fall

And I told her, of course, I needed more time. The time, the one thing that was slipping through my fingers like sand, the one thing I couldn't grasp no matter how hard I reached, no matter how much I clawed at it with shaking hands. MORE TIME!

She laughed at first, thinking I was joking. But it wasn't a joke, no. This wasn't some playful little quip about early mornings and needing coffee. This was the truth of the world as it crumbled, as it fell apart in the most silent, insidious way. The more I thought about it, the clearer it became—the whole damn universe was designed to trick me. To trap me in this endless loop of trying to catch up with something that would forever be out of reach.

“More time to build... to create,” I said to her, my words tangling in my throat, desperate, desperate for her to see it, to understand the sheer weight of it. But she didn’t. How could she? How could anyone? No one understands how it feels to be right there, standing at the edge of everything, watching the world spin in a way that makes no sense. WHO PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER?!

I could feel the fabric of reality itself bending and stretching, cracking under the pressure of its own absurdity. I KNOW WHAT'S COMING. I can see the gears turning, the joke being set up with meticulous care. This whole thing—it was just a setup for some laugh. And I was the punchline. We all are.

I looked at her, trying to explain, but all I could hear was the ticking of the clock, echoing louder and louder, mocking me, taunting me. TICK, TICK, TICK. The sound of time running out, running away, slipping through cracks like water in an old, rotting house.

So I needed more time. Not for anything simple, no. I needed it to create, to build, to try and make sense of something that would never, ever make sense. Time had become the only thing worth anything, and no matter how much I begged for it, there would never be enough. Not enough to make it stop—the joke. Not enough to fix everything before it collapsed into itself.

“Why?” she asked, her voice a little softer now, unsure if I was serious. But I was serious. I was deadly serious.

The truth? The truth was a cruel one. And it was staring at me in the face, laughing. The joke was on me, and all I could do was laugh back. It’s all slipping, babe, don’t you see? Everything we know, everything we’ve built, is just a fragile little piece in this cosmic play.

I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t fix it. And that’s when I realized, maybe that was the joke all along. Maybe we weren’t supposed to fix it. Maybe we were just supposed to laugh.

**Body:**

Yo, Vancouver! 👋 Thinking about getting your place pressure washed? Before you get hosed (pun intended 😉), let's talk about what it ACTUALLY costs.

It ain't a simple ""one price fits all"" deal. Think of it like ordering at a fancy coffee shop – a basic drip coffee is way cheaper than a triple-shot, venti, caramel macchiato with extra foam. Same goes for pressure washing.

**Here's the lowdown:**

*   **Size matters:** Duh. Bigger house/driveway/deck = more $$$
*   **Surface type:** Concrete is easy peasy, wood is a bit finnicky and costs a tad more.
*   **Dirt level:** Light dusting vs. years of moss buildup? Huge difference in price.
*   **Accessibility:** Can the pros reach it easily, is it on a hill? All factors.
*   Hot or Cold Water: Power washing uses hot, pressure uses cold water.

**Ballpark Figures (don't hold me to these, get a quote!):**

*   **Small house/townhouse:** Could be $300-$500+
*   **Larger detached house:** $600 - $1000+, even more for mansions!
*   **Driveway:** Maybe $0.30-$0.50 per sq ft, but many have minimums.
*    Hot water cleaning (power washing), ussually costs more.

**Pro Tips to Save $$$:**

*   **Get multiple quotes!** Seriously, don't just go with the first company.
*   **Ask about package deals.** (Driveway + deck = discount?)
*   **Look for seasonal promos.**
*    DIY is possible, but be careful.

**TL;DR:** Pressure washing prices in Vancouver are variable. Get quotes, consider the factors, and don't be afraid to ask questions! Want to know more specifics, we have a full Cost Guide: [link to your article]. Keepin' it clean, Vancouver! ✨

Jace sat on his worn-out couch, the afternoon light slanting through a dirty window in his one-bedroom apartment. The place smelled like old coffee and dreams deferred—but today was different. Today, he was about to prove that you don’t need a million-dollar studio to create something real.

“Everybody says you need a proper studio to sound professional,” Jace muttered to himself. He took a long drag from his cigarette and exhaled slowly. His gear was modest: Logic Pro 11.1 on his battered MacBook, a Volt 276 interface, and an AT2020 mic—tools that most would overlook. But he knew how to work them like a pro.

⸻

STEP 1: NO MORE WASTING TIME

Every recording session used to start the same way—a tedious ritual of setting up EQs, compressors, reverb, delay, and limiters. Jace spent too much time tweaking settings, and not enough time laying down tracks. That day, he decided to build a custom vocal template in Logic, a preset that would load his favorite settings instantly.

He set it up with precision:
	•	Channel EQ to clean up the raw tone.
	•	Vintage VCA Compressor to smooth out the dynamics.
	•	Space Designer for just the right amount of reverb.
	•	Delay Designer to add a touch of echo.
	•	Limiter to keep it tight and clear.

With a click, the template was saved. He closed Logic, then reopened it. Everything loaded instantly. It was a small victory, but it meant more time making music and less time messing with settings.

⸻

STEP 2: THE MIC PLACEMENT

Next up was the AT2020 mic, which Jace treated with the respect of a seasoned veteran. He set it up carefully on its stand, adjusting the pop filter just so. He measured the distance—about 6 to 12 inches—knowing that too close would muffle his voice and too far would leave it thin.

“Every little detail counts,” he whispered, almost like a mantra. He angled the mic slightly off-axis to soften the harsh S’s and P’s, and he had rigged up some DIY soundproofing in the closet using blankets. It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough.

He pulled on his DT770 Pro headphones and did a quick mic test. The sound was clean, raw, and honest.

⸻

STEP 3: ADDING THE SECRET SAUCE

Now came the part where the magic happened. Jace recorded a few takes—a smooth verse and a raw hook that carried the weight of his experiences. But the vocals still felt a bit too clean, too sterile. He needed that warmth, that punch, that grit.

He applied a touch of soft saturation using an overdrive plugin to add a vintage feel. Then, he layered on a Vintage Opto Compressor to bring the dynamics into line, and a bit of parallel compression to keep the power without losing clarity. It was subtle, but the difference was unmistakable.

He leaned back, listening intently. The track now carried a warmth and character that made it sound like it had been recorded in a high-end studio—even though it all came from his small apartment.

⸻

THE FINAL MIX

Before calling it a day, Jace tackled the final polish. Harsh sibilance could ruin a track, so he dialed in Logic’s De-Esser to smooth out the edges. He adjusted the Adaptive Limiter, ensuring that every note hit hard without distortion. The mix was balanced, honest, and undeniably real.

⸻

THE PROOF IS IN THE SOUND

Jace uploaded his track to his social media pages and sent a link to a few trusted friends. The response was immediate and electric.

“Man, where did you record this?” one friend asked.
“In your crib?” another replied, in disbelief.

Jace just smirked. He knew the truth—this was his craft, his hustle, built on ingenuity and raw determination. There were no studios involved, no fancy gear; just a guy with a dream, proving that sometimes, all you need is the right mindset to make magic.

He looked out the window as dusk settled over the city, the neon lights flickering to life on the streets. In that moment, Jace realized that the real studio was wherever he put his heart into it. And that was the most believable, uncut truth of all.",3,1741378820.0,LogicPro,1,0.6,False

I started walking, one hour everyday after work on the treadmill. I decided after one month of walking, I will implement 30 minute body weight exercises. So walking one hour plus 30 minutes of body weight. I am going to measure my weight loss by fitting into clothes. Currently I’m a size 14/16, more towards size 16.

So am I doing this right? Should I weigh myself? What do you do?

It was bad enough that literally any time I ate, I knew I was going to either 1. Be in INTENSE pain, or 2. Vomit. Or sometimes 3, be in pain until I vomited. 

I switched meats to chicken, but that's gotten me sick now too, slowly moving into lean stuff like turkey and fish. But it can't be a lot, or I will start getting sick.

Thankfully, I don't get the same stomach pain I used to, but this is seriously annoying, and also real bad for my teeth. I'm wondering if it's gastroparesis caused by my surgery, considering i have never had issues with this sort of thing before. ",3,1741378479.0,Gastroparesis,3,0.81,False

Anyway, I see so many requests and reviews mentioning whipped cream, and I haven't had the opportunity to experience it. Obviously this is kind of subjective and varies with culture but is it referring to a buttery, mildly sweet but milky scent like whipped fresh cream from, or a coffee whipped cream where its sweeter and there's a bit of aerosol, aspartame, steamed milk scent? I like both but I just don't know what it's describing, if anyone with more experience can help!",2,1741378399.0,FemFragLab30plus,1,1.0,False

Her enjoyment of such served as more of an outlet for her than anything. 

Well into the night, Aiza (with the help of many cups of coffee) wrote out a platform for release to the public and to court the votes senators. 

A few prominent points included:

**Justice for the Resolute.**

No apologies to the La’Dotta clan for their unjustified attack on our vessel. As Chancellor I will demand the immediate return of the Resolute crew and that we are given justice for this attack, recompense and those responsible. We will give clan La’Dotta a chance for peace and to avoid further bloodshed, but if our terms are refused we will have no choice but to intervene. Anything less would only encourage future attacks. There will be peace through our shared strength. I did not start this conflict, but as Chancellor I will end it. 

As Chancellor I will also diplomatically reach out to those other clans not responsible for the attack to make it clear it would be unwise to back clan La’Dotta. Our quarrel is only with those who attacked us. I do not consider them an enemy of the Republic unless they side with them. We should not make enemies where there are none but we will not tolerate such attacks any longer.

**Bolstering of Planetary Defence Forces and Judicial Forces.**

Every world should have the chance to defend themselves from threats, not just those who can afford large defensive fleets or those lucky enough to have Judicial ships in their system at the time. As a result, the Senate will assist less wealthy worlds at risk from pirates or other threats in acquiring their own defence forces, minimizing any economic burden. This will also mean an increase in employment both in worlds with now larger defence forces and from a bigger market for ships. Economic growth and prosperity cannot occur without a baseline of safety.

There still are matters best handled by the Judicial Forces such as peacekeeping and assisting planetary forces. For that, they too will receive additional funding. 

As Chancellor I will reject the dangerous and unprecedented calls for a large, centralized Galactic Army. The office of the Chancellor or a slim majority in the senate must not have the ability to impose their will upon the Galaxy through sheer force of arms rather than the consent of the governed. 

**Planetary Autonomy.**

Each planet has a unique culture, with varying needs and interests. The role of the Senate is to address these needs, not to impose on the way of life or the autonomy of our member worlds. A planet’s people knows best how to handle their own governance, not Senators who have never been there. As Chancellor I will serve our many common interests but respect our differences. 

**Stand Against Violence & Hate.**

As of late, there has been a series of violent xenophobic incidents against non human citizens of the Republic. While our citizens have freedom of speech, acts of violence and lawbreaking won’t be tolerated.  I condemn the actions of these mobs and lawbreakers and I as Chancellor will do all I can to enforce the law and protect all our people. 

Republic Security Forces will be made available to reinforce planetary police in the restoration of law and order. Every citizen of the Republic deserves to feel safe in their communities and homes.

**Lower Income Tax.**

As Chancellor I will reduce the Republic wide income tax to boost the galactic economy through consumer spending and trade, while also ensuring our citizens keep more of their hard earned credits.

**Slim Government & Lower Regulations.**

Overbearing bureaucracy and gridlock has made it nearly impossible for the Senate to act even when it should. Unnecessary regulation and bloat must be done away with, while preserving those that keep government and companies honest.

**Voluntary Common Market.**

Coming from a family of traders, I know the importance of this issue, how we are all interconnected economically. While I support free trade and believe it to be the best model, as Chancellor I will respect the right of each world to set its own trade policy according to the interests of their people. I will however create a voluntary galactic common market for worlds to enter into if they so choose.",1,1741378138.0,Model_Galactic_Senate,0,1.0,False
