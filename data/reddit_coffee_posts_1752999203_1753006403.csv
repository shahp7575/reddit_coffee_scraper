1m4lcx8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4lcx8,Cake Day Collection,"Hello r/iems, the 100 under $100 guy is back realizing only a while ago that his cake day was today. So as a way to commemorate he decided to show an update of how far down he has fallen in the rabbit hole, no longer seeing the light of day. 

The collection changed quite a bit since I last posted, I think 8 months ago. With new key additions such as the Moondrop blessing 2, Truthear zero red, Trn Jaws, and OH MY GOD IS THAT A THIEAUDIO HYPE 4?! YOURE CHEATING!!! Well let me explain, during my trip to Japan I had the chance to visit e-earphones and their holy second hand rack. While I was browsing around having a blast listening to all the iems they had to offer from all budget ranges like a kid in a candy store, my mom went up to me when I was listening to the hype 4s and blessing 3s, and told me she would get me one of either, so I had to pick. Ultimately I went with the Hype 4s, because I already had the blessing 2s and the hype 4 I sold back then was talking to me in its spirit like its some sort of green goblin mask, so I caved in and chose it. Of course I will not be counting it towards the challenge tally for the second price was NOT under $100 (though I wish it was) 

Anyway I am nearing halfway in this predicament I placed myself in, and with the way the budget market is moving right now, I doubt I will stop anytime soon lol. Although, I am trying to be more deliberate with the iems I chose now, because buying up ultra budget iems for the sake of just completion just makes this pointless (as if it isnt already). That does not mean I wont get ultra budget iems anymore, I will probably just gun for the ones that have a good reputation and sound (such as the tanchjim bunny). I will also be trying to get lesser known and unique iems to add to the collection, just so I can spice things up a bit, and if its good, I will give it its flowers (such as the trn jaws and orca), but if its crap, I will say its crap. So far this challenge has been fun, I was able to try out a lot of different iems while learning more about what I enjoy listening and making new friends along the way. And to those who are thinking of doing the same, dont. Please use your money wisely and pick iems that would actually help upgrade your collection. The main reason I am doing this is because, I have the means to do this and I find this enjoyable, this is something me and my friends bond together over coffee about, and I also use this so I can help them make informed purchases because in my country, there are no places to try and buy iems (though I am semi interested in trying to open one in the future).

Lastly, I might make follow up posts semi annually until I finish the challenge (probably every cake day and christmas). Also I wanna try making a review channel/blog but lowk dont know how to start lol.",1,1753006149.0,iems,1,1.0,False

The energy, environment and rawness of the atmosphere of the city motivate me. The crowds I get and fast paced way I understand. Looking for hidden spots or vibing areas I love. Then there was a coffee shop I was in for an event with 30 people. I talked to around 10 and heard multiple conversations and was ok. I did need to get away for 2 minutes to order something then went back in it. 

Is this normal? I always hear how people like me are supposed to want secluded areas and to be more introverted. I mean I can thrive in alone just studying or chilling but when I’m down for it I can do highly stimulated environments because I fully know before going they are meant to be that way. I’m not the greatest being surprised and this works both ways if I go in expecting high stimulation and it’s low stimulation I can still do it but I may get bored. ",1,1753005916.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1m4l7r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m4l7r2/a_story_of_connection_and_detachment_with_someone/,A Story of Connection and Detachment with Someone I Once Loved,"So, the year before for the local choir that I am in, and have been for years, this new girl joined, and I had just gotten off of oxygen after being in the hospital due to HHT and Lung AVMs. Had many surgeries. Grew to feel very alone. Not just alone without a GF, but just no really good friends alone, though most of it was not having someone. I thought she was very pretty, and I wanted to talk to her so bad, but I was drastically nervous. I grew a massive crush on her for a long time. The 2023-2024 choir year came and went. Hadn’t a single interaction with her. Autumn 2024 came, and I only had a number of small interactions, primarily on Halloween costume night when she brought her very loud and talkative friend with her. I was dressed as G-Man from ‘Half-Life’. Her friend and I exchanged humorous glances, but I wouldn’t see her again until later. Come 2025. In January, I had a short lived relationship with a girl who just wanted me for my body. Near the end of February in 10th grade while doing a college dual enrollment program, specifically a college manufacturing robotics class for an Associate’s in Mechatronics, my current major, I had a trip out with my mom to Nashville to my great aunt’s house to clear out the belongings of my late grandfather who passed away months before. Upon returning to choir, I felt a massive boost of confidence, after leaning not to give a crap about what people think about you. So, when I saw her walking in, I immediately hit her with my signature, “Hey, how’s it goin’?” She talked to me, seemed a touch surprised, but I immediately began to yap about my degree, my robotics class, my music as an electronic musician, and the such. Had a very special night. Next week, since choir is once a week, I saw her again, began to talk to her more. After that night, she did something the me from 2023 would absolutely go crazy about. She asked me for my number, and I gave it to her. We began to talk on text a good bit. March then came. And she asked me out to her homeschool program’s Prom. I immediately accepted. It was at the end of the month, so while waiting, we decided to hang out one weekend. We decided to hang out in downtown. I saw her and her friend again. On a Friday in the middle of the month, we met at a pizza pub, ate, I showed them my pictures on my Nikon, and then walked around town late at night. We got coffee right before the shop closed, and as it grew dark, we sat on a bench outside, her friend’s arm around me and we laughed and talked. I took a selfie of us on my Nikon, and I bounced. That Sunday, we decided to hang out again at the mall. We got coffee, walked around, watched a movie, then bounced. The next day, I got seriously emotional, as the end of the year workload was getting to me, and I loved being with them. I broke down. But, I saw them at choir. She brought her friend, who sat in the lobby as we sang. Afterwards, they told me that I was “a bit too much”. I didn’t know until I asked her the next day. She said I was a bit too much affectionate with her friend, as I was just trying to match her energy. But it was settled. March went on. Then came Prom. They came in beautiful dresses, and I wore a nice navy suit to match hers. We danced, talked, laughed, then went to go eat at Waffle House, something that I fantasized about doing with her WAY before I started talking to her. She even gave me a cool saxophone pin that I wore on my collar as a gift that night, since I play sax. We then left, and the Monday afterwards, choir was cancelled. April came, and after no texts from her or anything, I got emotional once more. Tried texting her for the whole month, but barely any interactions. Just our messages filled with my good morning and good night messages. Only text from her was when she told me she was having a hard time with school. I was nice, she told her that she could talk to me if she needed me. We did see each other at choir at times, but barely anything else. She seemed so, distant. A juxtaposition to March. Worried me. Came May, and our choir concert was at the 5th of the month. I told her that I wanted to gift her a rings set similar to one she had as a returned favor for the sax pin. She then went on to tell me that it was “too far” and that she didn’t want any relationship or romance with me, just to be friends (if you can even call it that looking at it). Told me she didn’t want to hang with me over the summer, since her friend had moved back to Texas, and she didn’t hang with guys unless there was another girl there as a safety thing, which I understand completely. Still kinda saddened me. Well, I had already bought her the rings, so I just gave them to her anyways. It wasn’t a matter of wanting a relationship with her. I was friends with her, and that was something my self from years ago would do anything for. Even though I wanted one. But it was mainly just the thought of giving me a gift, and all the memories we had together. We haven’t talked in nearly two months. I’m sad that it ended, but I’m happy that it happened.",1,1753005617.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1m4l7o8,https://i.redd.it/8lzxrbsm50ef1.png,Stablecoin… That thing everyone pretends to understand,"You ever sit in a crypto convo and nod along like you *totally* get what a stablecoin is — while secretly thinking, “Wait... stable *what*?” Yeah. We've all been there.

Look, not trying to call anyone out, but the term gets thrown around like it’s some kind of common sense. Spoiler alert: it’s not. And honestly? It sounds like a contradiction. Crypto... stable? That’s like calling a rollercoaster “relaxing transportation.”

But stay with me.

# Picture this (It’ll be quick, promise)

You’re chilling with some Bitcoin in your wallet. Yesterday it was flexing at $70K. Today it’s faceplanted to $61K and you're wondering if you should’ve just bought a used Prius instead. Classic.

Enter: the stablecoin. The calm cucumber of the crypto world. The digital dollar’s chill cousin. The one who shows up on time, doesn’t get drunk at parties, and always has gum.

# What even is It, though?

Alright, here's the skinny.

A **stablecoin** is a type of crypto that doesn’t swing wildly like the others. It’s tied — like, hard-tied — to a steady, external value. Most often, that’s the U.S. dollar. But hey, sometimes gold. Sometimes euro. Occasionally, something more exotic.

One USDT? One dollar. USDC? Same story. DAI? Pretty close, give or take a smidge. The whole idea is to keep it steady — like the ground under your feet, not like a bouncy castle during a sugar rush.

How? Magic? Nah. Mostly backed by reserves (if they're playing fair), meaning there’s actual money (or at least *something*) somewhere — bank accounts, crypto, maybe some beanbags in an office in Zug. And yes, a few of them run on algorithms, but let’s not talk about that one with the name that rhymes with “oops” (yeah, Terra/Luna — we see you).

# Why should you even care?

Let me answer that with a question: do you like paying high fees, waiting forever, and feeling anxious 24/7?

Exactly.

**Now, check this out:**

* **Zap-fast Transfers:** Try sending dollars overseas through a bank and see how long it takes (spoiler: a small eternity). Now send USDT over Tron. Done in, like, a blink.
* **Almost No Fees:** Say goodbye to middlemen who smile while charging you 3%. It’s just you, your wallet, and maybe your cat watching from the couch.
* **No More Drama:** Want to ride out a Bitcoin storm without selling off everything? Swap to stablecoin, kick back, sip tea. Or coffee. Or mezcal, I’m not judging.
* **Exchange Without The Hassle:** Wanna turn your USDT into cash? Or back into BTC when the price calms down? That's where [BitLoga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274) slides in — smooth, reliable, and yeah, totally online. No lines, no sketchy booths. And if you're in Moscow? You're golden. We’re already there (digitally speaking).

# But let’s be real — There’s a catch

Yep. Wouldn’t be crypto without one.

Not all stablecoins wear capes. Some are duct-taped together and praying for market mercy. So, don’t blindly throw your paycheck at the first coin with “stable” in its name. Stick with the big players: USDT, USDC, DAI. Anything with a whitepaper that looks like it was written in Comic Sans? Run.

# Quick recap — in case you skimmed

A **stablecoin** is like a safety net for your crypto brain. It keeps you in the game without the stress. It doesn’t moon, doesn’t crash — it just exists, quietly doing its job while the rest of crypto loses its mind.

And if you ever need to flip it into fiat (or go the other way), [BitLoga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274) is your friend. Fast. Private. No drama. We keep it boring — in the best possible way.",3,1753005608.0,BitLoga,0,1.0,False

Years ago, I worked in a clothes shop. Fairly big brand, shut down now. It was my first job, and I worked weekends and holidays because I was still in college. (This boss also made a point of shifting me for days she knew I had classes but that stories boring).

One day, after usually doing stock prep and security, she decided to put me on styling the mannequins. I actually loved doing stuff like that, so yay! We essentially had free reign, just dress it, as long as its stock from the shop, and it looks good, go for it. 

Despite my goth chic appearance, I had a soft spot for fashion, so I wandered around the shop. Clothes, shoes, accessories. 

I picked out a really nice pair of soft washed denim jeans, with a slight boot cut, a pair of brown suede ankle boots with an inch heel, a nice flowery, kind of light and loose top, which I tucked into the jeans but left loose, with a white under cami, and this gorgeous brown bag that was on sale. Delicate accessories, because I didn't want to overpower. I was really proud of it! My coworkers (who didn't really speak to me, total clique, and i didnt fit in) gave me so many compliments! They wanted me to do their mannequins too because even though this was their thing, they always overthought it, whereas mine flowed easily. Think summer liquid lunch outfit. 

The boss shows up maybe a half hour later. She practically ripped the clothes off the doll. Apparently brown doesn't go with denim, it looked hideous, shed never wear something like that....

My coworkers actually defended me. They said that everything I picked was not only in fashion, but was exactly the type of thing that our clientele would buy. She shut them all down...

She stormed off to the tills and I went back to security. 

Here's the thing. I'd put the manne back up just before the lunch rush. Within that half hour, most customers had seen it. 

About 80% of the customers bought at least something that had been on the manne. 2 people bought the whole ensemble. And the boss was the one on the till. 

I heard my coworkers talking later, apparently the boss was so pissed off that 'that little goth bitch' had styled an outfit that people liked within about 8 months if working there, while she had never had a full outfit sale in 20+ years. 

I was never allowed to dress them again, but my coworkers on dress duty would come to me for advice behind the bosses back. Boss would dish out the compliments to them without knowing it was me. Coworkers never said anything, but would buy me a coffee and a snack on breaks as thanks. They knew if she found out it was me, that manne would be stripped faster than airport security with a dealer.

1m4l21v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4l21v,Possible structural colour in coffee rings?,"Have I found structural colour in these coffee rings?

In making some coffee the other day, I realised that the dripper I was using had a very slight leak when I first pour the water into the coffee grounds, so a small amount of very dilute coffee (<10s brewing) water drips out. With a hectic day I forgot to wipe it clean, and ~12 hours later noticed that it was still a “standard” coffee ring with no prismatic qualities, just plain brown coffee colour darker around the edges, and that the middle hadn’t quite evaporated fully. 

Fast forward to today, ~48h later since I was out yesterday, and an astonishingly vibrant graduated colour has developed on the inside of the ring. I can’t quite capture the extent of the colour on camera, but it’s almost as vibrant as unprocessed natural opal I’ve seen in museum collections.

After learning some very high-level information on structural colour in very slow evaporation of thin films and manmade opal, it seems like structural colour from slow crystallisation could be a possible explanation for this? I would have immediately thought of a residual oil from the brewing due to the oil-slick nature of the colour distribution, but I’m not sure about this.

Built a birthday reminder app that does more than just bd reminders (obviously). It also creates a detailed profile for each person you add. Call it psychometric or personality profiling, your choice. I spent around two to three weeks on it, dedicating a couple of hours daily (not sure if that’s overkill for such app), but I think the core concept is solid, feel free to prove me wrong, and the design isn’t too shabby. I’m no graphic artist, so any design suggestions are more than welcome.

(P.S. I’ll apply your input to future projects and tweak this app 🙂)

All basic birthday features: widgets, notifications, and the essential logic are entirely free. If you’d like full access to detailed profile statistics, there’s a one-time unlock fee, about the cost of grabbing a coffee. Reasonable?

And here’s a fun launch anecdote: ASC initially rejected it because of the horoscope section. So I quietly removed any references to horoscopes, without touching the profiling engine itself, and it got approved immediately. Maybe such insight might help those who struggle with spam, where the ""spam"" is secondary feature, not primary.

Let me know your thoughts on the app!

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.

A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

There's just something about the hum of chatter, the occasional clink of a cup, and all those espresso machines humming along.

I've just started blogging around coffee topics. My first post is focusing around decaf coffee, how it is made and how it evolved. It is inspired and partially based on [James Hoffman's videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=james+hoffmann+decaf) but also many other interesting sources I found.

I'd be super interested to:

* understand if this is reading material you enjoy
* get input for topics you would be interested in for next articles
* start discussion on your favorite decaf beans (would add your favorites to the summary at the end of the blog).

I have disabled the comment section on my blog, because I would love to foster the discussion around it here on reddit if it is of interest.

**Introduction: The Rise of Quality Decaf**

Decaf coffee was once scoffed at by coffee purists, but attitudes are changing. An increasing number of quality-focused coffee drinkers are embracing **espresso without caffeine** in pursuit of great flavor minus the jitters. In fact, younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials) are driving a decaf renaissance, often choosing decaf to reduce anxiety and improve sleep without sacrificing their coffee ritual. Specialty coffee experts like James Hoffmann note that *“culture is shifting”* \- decaf is no longer seen as “*not real coffee*,” and modern decaf can be a delicious option that doesn’t feel like a compromise. High-end roasters now apply the same craftsmanship to decaf beans as they do to regular beans, meaning you can enjoy rich coffee flavor with minimal caffeine. In this context, it’s no surprise that interest in **decaf coffee process** and quality has surged among home baristas and coffee connoisseurs.

I can still take around 200 mg of caffeine a day in any form, so excedrin tension headache and coffee have helped. I also have prochlorperazine I can use. 

Anyway, 2nd trimester I had a horrible run of migraines for 13 days straight. So they upped me to 400mg of magnesium glycinate and increased my Labetalol (developed high BP early in pregnancy). preeclampsia was ruled out. 

After about 2+ months on it consistently, MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, I think it’s helping. Still had a few and definitely some general headaches, and aura without migraines (where I thought one might start and didn’t).

1m4kxt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m4kxt8/how_tall_should_an_accent_chair_be_compared_to_a/,How tall should an accent chair be compared to a sofa?,"I recently went through the process of redesigning my living room and spent countless hours researching the perfect accent chair height. I learned that getting the proportions right is crucial for both aesthetics and comfort.

Generally, an accent chair should be similar in height to your sofa, with the seat height within 1-2 inches of each other. The standard seat height for most accent chairs ranges from 17 to 19 inches, while most sofas sit between 17 to 18 inches high. This alignment creates visual harmony and ensures comfortable conversation between people seated on different pieces.

When I was shopping for my accent chair, I discovered that the overall height (including the backrest) should complement the sofa without overshadowing it. A good rule of thumb is to keep the chair's total height within 4 inches of your sofa's height. I found some great options here that follow these guidelines: https://explorehomedeals.com/accent-chairs

Some other important factors I considered:

1. Room scale - larger rooms can handle taller accent chairs
2. Ceiling height - lower ceilings work better with lower-profile furniture
3. Purpose - reading chairs might need higher backs for support
4. Style - modern chairs tend to sit lower than traditional ones

I also learned that the chair's seat depth matters just as much as height. Most comfortable accent chairs have a seat depth between 20-24 inches. This provides enough support while allowing your feet to touch the ground comfortably.

After measuring my space and considering these factors, I found my perfect accent chair through this collection: https://explorehomedeals.com/accent-chairs. The height matched my sofa perfectly, and it transformed my living room's look completely.

A few quick tips from my experience:
- Measure your sofa's seat height before shopping
- Consider the chair's intended use
- Account for any pillows or cushions
- Remember that upholstery compression can affect height over time
- Test the chair height with your coffee table

Getting the right height relationship between your sofa and accent chair might seem like a small detail, but it makes a huge difference in creating a cohesive, comfortable living space. Trust me, taking the time to get these measurements right is totally worth it.",1,1753004544.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

She is a rainbow baby and although she's pretty ""easy"", I've still struggled with PPA/PPD/recovering from loss and the overwhelm of parenthood. We'd always talked about three kids but since having my daughter I've found myself considering *maybe* one more. At the minute I'm so content with our family of three.

  
Several factors have me leaning more towards being OAD but the biggest reason is living an ocean away from my side of the family. I'm American and live in the UK (husband is British). Since moving here I've found it so much more difficult to create a life and make friends here than I'd anticipated. Now that I'm emerging from the fog of the first year I feel like I don't have much of a life to go back to. Our village is really just my wonderful MIL who has been there for me when my own family couldn't be. But I just really wish I had my own people close by. My parents visit once or twice a year and I'm lucky if I get to go back to see friends. I just don't feel like I have an outlet, nor the time to find hobbies or friends. I've met other moms during my mat leave but they're all so busy it's hard to find the time to get to know them. I just wish I could have girls' nights out, a last minute coffee with a friend, or a regular fitness class I could attend with a group. Everything I'm interested in in my area is scheduled for times when I'm working or don't have childcare. I feel like everyone here has been here their whole lives and already has friends--baby classes and groups I've attended have been so cliquey and beyond a few surface chats with friendly moms, it never goes beyond that.

  
My husband would really like another baby but has assured me he'd be content with just our daughter if we either couldn't have or I decided against another. So we're giving it a year and will see how we feel when our daughter's close to 3. I know things could change a lot and maybe that feeling that our family is incomplete will emerge.

# Introduction: The Future of Web Development Is AI-Powered

The web development landscape is changing at breakneck speed — and artificial intelligence is at the heart of this transformation. In 2025, AI is no longer just a buzzword or experimental feature; it’s a core part of the developer toolkit. From generating clean code in seconds to automating repetitive tasks and even building entire websites from scratch, AI tools are helping developers work smarter, not harder.

Whether you're a seasoned frontend developer crafting sleek interfaces, a backend engineer optimizing performance, or a full-stack dev juggling both worlds — AI is here to make your workflow faster and more efficient. These tools don’t just save time; they enhance creativity, improve code quality, and help bridge the gap between design and development.

In this post, we’re diving into ten of the most powerful AI tools shaping the future of web development. These are tools that every developer should have on their radar in 2025 — not just for staying competitive, but for building better, more scalable digital experiences.

# GitHub Copilot – Your AI Coding Sidekick

If there’s one AI tool that has truly changed the game for developers, it’s GitHub Copilot. Built by GitHub and powered by OpenAI, Copilot acts like an intelligent coding assistant right inside your favorite IDE. In 2025, it's smarter, faster, and more reliable than ever — making it a must-have for web developers at any experience level.

Copilot autocompletes code in real-time, using natural language prompts and context-aware suggestions. Just type a comment like // create a responsive navigation menu and watch as it instantly generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you need. It’s trained on billions of lines of open-source code, which means it has a solid grasp on common patterns, frameworks, and even your personal coding habits over time.

For example, a frontend developer building a React app could use Copilot to scaffold components, write hooks, or generate state logic with just a few keystrokes. Meanwhile, backend developers can quickly spin up API routes, handle error logic, or integrate database operations — all with AI-powered guidance that understands the context of their project.

In short, Copilot doesn’t just speed up coding — it helps you focus on problem-solving rather than boilerplate. It’s like having a senior dev whispering over your shoulder (minus the coffee breaks).

Up next, let’s look at a tool that’s redefining UI/UX design for developers: **Uizard**.

# Uizard – UI Design from Text

Imagine designing a sleek user interface without touching a single design tool — just typing a prompt like “a mobile login screen with social sign-in options,” and seeing it come to life. That’s exactly what **Uizard** offers. In 2025, this AI-powered UI design platform is a favorite among developers, product managers, and startups looking to move fast without sacrificing aesthetics.

Uizard turns plain English into fully designed user interfaces in seconds. It’s an ideal tool for prototyping apps, websites, and digital products — especially when you don’t have a dedicated designer on the team. Just describe what you need, and Uizard generates high-fidelity mockups that you can tweak, test, and export. Its drag-and-drop editor makes refining layouts intuitive, and you can collaborate with teammates in real-time.

For example, a solo developer building an MVP for a SaaS dashboard can use Uizard to create all the screens — login, user profiles, analytics views — by simply entering a few prompts. Within minutes, they’ll have a ready-to-code design they can hand off to Copilot or integrate into their framework of choice.

Uizard isn’t just about speed — it’s about making design accessible and iterative, helping you validate ideas visually before writing a single line of code.

Next, let’s explore a tool that brings AI directly into your daily coding workflow: **Pieces for Developers**.

# Pieces for Developers – AI-Powered Code Snippets & Workflow Assistant

Ever wish you had a personal assistant that remembered every useful code snippet you’ve ever written, found exactly what you need in seconds, and worked seamlessly across your tools? **Pieces for Developers** makes that a reality. In 2025, it’s become an essential AI companion for devs juggling multiple projects, tools, and technologies.

At its core, Pieces is an intelligent code snippet manager — but it’s so much more than just copy-paste storage. It smartly captures code snippets from your IDE, browser, terminal, or even screenshots, and uses AI to categorize, tag, and describe them. This makes retrieval lightning-fast, even weeks later when you can’t quite remember where that perfect regex or API call came from.

Let’s say you’re switching between frontend and backend tasks, or hopping across client projects. Instead of searching through old repos, Slack messages, or random notes, you can simply ask Pieces: *“Show me that MongoDB connection snippet I used last month.”* It pulls it up, complete with context, tags, and related suggestions — ready to drop into your current workflow.

Pieces also integrates deeply with tools like VS Code, JetBrains, and browsers, making it feel like a natural extension of your dev environment.

As workflows get more complex and time becomes more valuable, having an AI-powered assistant like Pieces can be a real game-changer.

Next up, let’s look at how AI is building entire websites from scratch — meet **Framer AI**.

# Framer AI – Build Websites with a Prompt

What if building a website was as easy as writing a sentence? That’s exactly what **Framer AI** delivers. In 2025, it stands out as one of the most intuitive and powerful AI website builders — trusted by developers, designers, and even non-technical users who want to launch polished web pages quickly.

Framer AI lets you generate fully responsive websites from simple text inputs. Just type something like, *“Create a landing page for a productivity app with a hero section, testimonials, and pricing plans,”* and within seconds, it crafts a visually appealing layout. The designs are clean, modern, and production-ready, cutting down the time it usually takes to go from concept to code.

What makes Framer even more impressive is its flexibility. Developers can dive into the code and fine-tune components, while no-coders can stick to the intuitive drag-and-drop editor. This makes it a perfect tool for rapidly building MVPs, testing new ideas, or delivering fast mockups for clients — all without sacrificing quality or responsiveness.

Need to launch a product page by the end of the day? Framer AI has you covered. Want to iterate quickly with clients on design concepts? It’s built for that too.

Now that we’ve seen how AI can handle full-site generation, let’s turn to a tool that helps you clean up and refactor your code with AI precision: **Sourcery**.

# Sourcery – Refactor Smarter

Writing code is one thing — keeping it clean, efficient, and readable is a whole other challenge. That’s where **Sourcery** comes in. Designed specifically for Python developers, Sourcery is an AI-powered refactoring tool that analyzes your code in real time and offers suggestions to improve it — instantly.

In 2025, Sourcery has evolved into an essential part of any Python dev’s workflow. It doesn’t just clean up messy logic or rename variables — it rewrites inefficient patterns, removes redundancies, and suggests more Pythonic alternatives right in your editor. Think of it like Grammarly, but for Python code.

Let’s say you’ve written a function that gets the job done but feels clunky. Sourcery steps in with inline suggestions, offering cleaner alternatives that follow industry best practices. It might convert a loop into a list comprehension, simplify conditional statements, or flag unused variables — all without disrupting your flow.

For teams, Sourcery helps enforce consistent code quality across contributors, reducing review time and improving maintainability. And for solo developers, it’s a fantastic learning tool — showing you *why* a change is better, not just *what* to change.

If you’re working on a large codebase or just want to level up your code hygiene, Sourcery is like having a senior Python dev reviewing every line as you type.

Next, let’s look at a tool that builds full websites in under a minute — say hello to **Durable**.

# Durable – AI Website Builder for Solopreneurs

Need a full website in under a minute? **Durable** makes that possible — and it’s changing the game for solopreneurs, freelancers, and small business owners. In 2025, Durable has become the go-to AI website builder for anyone who wants to launch fast without compromising on quality.

Durable doesn’t just generate a layout — it creates the entire website, including content, structure, and design, based on a short input like *“Build a site for a local bakery with online ordering.”* In seconds, you get a clean, professional site with homepage sections, calls-to-action, contact forms, and even SEO-ready copy. No coding or design skills required.

It’s especially powerful for developers working with clients who need a quick digital presence — whether it's a portfolio, landing page, or service-based business site. Instead of spending hours on wireframes and initial builds, devs can use Durable to generate a solid starting point, then fine-tune it as needed.

Freelancers love it for its speed; small business owners appreciate how accessible it is. Whether you’re launching a side project or helping a client meet a tight deadline, Durable is the AI tool that gets you live — fast.

Next up, let’s check out a tool that brings intelligent code completion to teams and supports multiple languages: **Tabnine**.

# Tabnine – AI Code Completion Built for Teams

Now, let’s explore a tool that takes designs and transforms them directly into production-ready frontend code — meet **TeleportHQ**.

# TeleportHQ – AI-Driven Frontend Automation

Design-to-code used to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in web development — but not anymore. In 2025, **TeleportHQ** is leading the charge in frontend automation by bridging the gap between UI design and clean, production-ready code.

TeleportHQ takes Figma designs, hand-drawn sketches, or even simple wireframes and converts them into fully responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The best part? The code it generates isn’t just functional — it’s clean, modular, and easy to integrate into any modern frontend stack. This makes it a game-changer for developers tired of manually slicing and dicing designs.

The platform also features real-time collaboration and live preview capabilities. Designers and developers can work together in one space, tweak layouts, update styles, and instantly see changes — all without jumping between tools. This streamlines the entire frontend workflow, making the journey from design to deployment faster and far less painful.

Imagine working with a product team on a dashboard UI. Instead of spending hours recreating the design in code, you can feed the Figma file into TeleportHQ and get a clean codebase to build on — saving time and reducing friction.

Up next, we’ll look at a powerful visual builder that blends no-code flexibility with developer-friendly customization: **Builder.io**.

# [Builder.io](http://Builder.io) – Visual CMS + AI Dev Assistant

Bridging the gap between marketing teams and developers has always been a challenge — and [**Builder.io**](http://Builder.io) solves it beautifully. In 2025, it’s not just a visual CMS; it’s a collaborative powerhouse that combines intuitive design tools with AI-assisted code generation, all within a developer-friendly environment.

[Builder.io](http://Builder.io) offers a powerful drag-and-drop editor that allows non-technical users — like marketers, content creators, or designers — to update and customize web pages without writing code. But what sets it apart is its deep integration with popular frontend frameworks like **Next.js**, **React**, **Vue**, and more. Developers can create fully customizable components and expose them to the visual editor, keeping design flexible without sacrificing code quality.

Its built-in AI assistant helps generate custom code snippets, optimize layouts, and even suggest improvements based on user behavior and best practices. This allows teams to ship faster, test more frequently, and collaborate more effectively — all while maintaining a consistent brand and codebase.

For example, a developer can build a dynamic product page while enabling the marketing team to A/B test headlines and CTAs — all in the same platform. No bottlenecks, no cross-team friction.

Next, we wrap up with a tool designed specifically for WordPress developers who want to supercharge their workflow: **CodeWP**.

# CodeWP – AI for WordPress Devs

WordPress powers over 40% of the web, and in 2025, **CodeWP** is making life a whole lot easier for the developers behind those sites. Tailored specifically for the WordPress ecosystem, CodeWP is an AI-powered code generator that helps you write clean, functional WordPress code in seconds — no matter your level of experience.

What sets CodeWP apart is its deep understanding of the WordPress framework, including popular tools like **WooCommerce**, **Elementor**, **ACF**, and more. Whether you’re creating a custom shortcode, building a new plugin, or tweaking a WooCommerce checkout page, CodeWP can generate the right code snippet with just a prompt.

For example, a freelancer might need to create a custom post loop or a WooCommerce product filter — instead of digging through documentation or Stack Overflow, they can just ask CodeWP and get a copy-paste-ready solution instantly. It’s also a huge time-saver for agencies managing multiple client sites with varying technical requirements.

With support for multilingual prompts, frequent updates to match WordPress core changes, and smart suggestions based on best practices, CodeWP has become a must-have in every WordPress dev’s toolkit.

# Conclusion: AI Is Reshaping Web Development 

From writing cleaner code and automating design to building full websites from simple prompts, AI tools are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re becoming essential parts of the modern developer's workflow. Whether you're a solo freelancer, part of a startup, or working in a large dev team, the tools we've covered — like **GitHub Copilot**, **Uizard**, **Framer AI**, and **CodeWP** — offer powerful ways to speed up development, reduce repetitive tasks, and focus more on creativity and strategy.

Each tool serves a unique purpose, from frontend automation to backend assistance and full-site generation. And in 2025, the combination of these tools can help developers build better products faster than ever before.

But this list isn’t exhaustive — and the AI dev landscape is constantly evolving.

1m4kw59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m4kw59/are_round_coffee_tables_better_than_rectangular/,Are round coffee tables better than rectangular ones?,"After spending countless hours researching and trying different coffee tables in my living room, I've finally figured out the real differences between round and rectangular coffee tables. I've discovered that the choice really depends on your specific needs and space.

Round coffee tables are excellent for homes with small children since there are no sharp corners to worry about. They also create better flow in a room, making it easier to move around without bumping into corners. I particularly love how they soften the look of rooms that have too many straight lines and rectangular furniture.

However, rectangular coffee tables have their own advantages. They typically offer more surface area for books, remotes, and decorative items. If you're like me and enjoy having multiple people gather around the coffee table for board games or snacks, a rectangular table might be your better choice.

I recently found some great options for both styles on Amazon. You can check them out here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Here's what I've learned about choosing between the two shapes:

Space Considerations:
- Round tables work better in tight spaces
- Rectangular tables fit naturally between standard sofas
- Round tables are perfect for sectional sofas
- Square rooms often look better with round tables

Functionality:
- Rectangular tables provide more surface area
- Round tables are better for conversations
- Round tables make it easier to add extra seating
- Rectangular tables are better for storage (especially with shelves)

Style Impact:
- Round tables soften modern spaces
- Rectangular tables create clean lines
- Round tables make small rooms feel larger
- Rectangular tables anchor large rooms better

I used to think rectangular tables were always the way to go, but after trying both, I realize each has its place. For my apartment's small living room, a round table worked wonders in opening up the space.

If you're still unsure which style would work best for you, I'd recommend browsing through various options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. Sometimes seeing different styles in context can help make the decision clearer.

Remember, the perfect coffee table isn't just about shape - it's about how it fits your lifestyle and space. Take measurements, consider your daily activities, and think about who uses the space most often. Whether you choose round or rectangular, the right table will enhance both the function and style of your room.

I've tried both types in my home, and honestly, neither is inherently better. It all comes down to your specific needs and room layout. Focus on finding a table that works for your space rather than following trends or general rules.",1,1753004371.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1m4kw1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Matcha/comments/1m4kw1h/i_love_matcha_but_matcha_doesnt_love_me_back/,I love matcha but matcha doesn't love me back :(,"For starters, I have ADHD and I take meds for that (this may be important idk). So recently I started drinking matcha but I feel very bad after about 15 minutes. Sure, I feel energized but in a very uncomfortable way. I am very irritable and unstable. My heart rate goes very high and I am far more prone to executive dysfunction. Now, I feel so much better after energy drinks, even when I drink a whole monster i feel energized and ready to work (with slightly increased heart rate). Coffee is something in between. I feel like it should be reversed, I shoud feel bad after coffee and energy drinks, not matcha. I tried searching this on google but nothing comes up. Does anyone else expirience this? 

I have 2 ideas:
1. Maybe my meds react weirdly, I take 30mg of methylphenidate, 150mg of bupropion and 15 mg of escitalopram daily. Google says they shouldn't cause that but who knows. 
2. Maybe my matcha is too strong? I do roughly half a teaspoon of matcha powder and I drink it at most once a day. I feel like if I were to put less matcha powder I wouldn't be able to taste it.

# Part 1: The Big Headache: Why Making Cool Stuff Online Is So Hard

**Ever Had a Great Idea for a Course and Just… Gave Up?**

It often starts with a flash of excitement. You have a skill, a passion, or a unique piece of knowledge, and you think, ""This would make an amazing online course."" You can already see people benefiting from what you know, whether it's teaching them how to grow vegetables on their balcony, master a new software, or learn a new language. The idea feels bright, full of possibility, and for a moment, you're on top of the world.

But then, a different feeling starts to creep in. It’s a quiet voice at first, asking questions. ""Could I actually teach this?"" it whispers. ""Am I really an expert?"" Soon, that voice gets louder, joined by others. ""Who would even listen to me?"" ""There are probably a hundred other courses just like this."" This wave of self-doubt can be strong enough to stop a great idea in its tracks.

For many, this is where the journey ends. The initial spark is buried under a pile of uncertainty and frustration. You know you have something valuable to share, but the path from idea to a finished, sellable product seems impossibly long and complicated. The dream of launching your own course gets put on a shelf, filed under ""maybe someday,"" and you go back to your daily routine, feeling a little bit disappointed that you couldn't bring your vision to life. If this sounds familiar, you are not alone. It’s a common story, but it doesn’t have to be yours.

**The Three Big Walls: No Time, No Money, and No Clue Where to Start**

Beyond the mental hurdle of self-doubt, there are very real, practical obstacles that stand in the way of most aspiring course creators. These usually fall into three main categories, which I call the ""Three Big Walls.""

First, there's the **Time Wall**. Creating a high-quality course is not a weekend project. The process is a marathon. It begins with hours upon hours of research to structure your content, followed by scripting every single lesson. Then comes the recording, which requires setting up a quiet space, getting the right equipment, and speaking clearly and confidently. After that, you have to edit all the footage, design presentations or slides, and package everything into a professional-looking format. For most people with jobs, families, and other commitments, finding the dozens, if not hundreds, of hours needed is simply not realistic.

Next up is the **Money Wall**. While it’s possible to create a course on a tight budget, the hidden costs can add up quickly. Professional-looking graphics and branding often require hiring a designer. Turning raw video footage into polished lessons might mean paying a video editor. The software needed for recording, editing, and creating slide decks can come with hefty subscription fees. Then there's the cost of a platform to host your course and process payments. Before you’ve even made your first sale, you could be hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the hole.

Finally, there's the **""Clue"" Wall**. This is the technical barrier that stops so many talented people. You might be an expert in your field, but that doesn't mean you're a web developer or a digital marketer. The challenge of building a website from scratch, setting up a secure payment gateway, creating a members-only area for your students, and then figuring out how to market and sell your course is a massive undertaking. It’s a whole different skill set, and the technical complexity is enough to make anyone feel completely lost. These three walls, combined, are why so many great ideas never see the light of day.

# Part 2: The ""Easy Button"": A Deep Dive into AI Course Centric

**So, What on Earth is AI Course Centric?**

At its core, AI Course Centric is a tool designed to tear down those three big walls. Put simply, it’s an application that uses artificial intelligence to build entire online courses for you. The process starts with a single keyword or topic. From that one input, the AI generates a complete course, including the lessons, scripts, presentation slides, and even the videos.

The person behind this tool is Victory Akpos, an online entrepreneur who has seen firsthand how many people struggle with the technical and financial burdens of creating digital products. His goal was to create a platform that would allow anyone, regardless of their technical skill or budget, to build an online business by sharing their knowledge. The idea is to remove the traditional roadblocks, making course creation accessible to everyone, not just those with deep pockets or a team of experts. It’s intended to be a shortcut, handling the heavy lifting so you can focus on your idea.

**The Superpowers You Get: A Look at What It Actually Does**

This tool comes with a set of features aimed at automating the entire course creation process. Here’s a look at what it actually does for you:

* **From One Word to a Whole Course:** The main function is its ability to take a single keyword—like ""beginner yoga"" or ""social media marketing""—and have the AI research the topic, outline a curriculum, and write the content for each lesson. It builds the entire structure of the course for you.
* **Makes Videos For You:** It doesn’t just stop at text. The system can automatically turn the scripted lessons and slides into videos. This feature is designed to solve the problem of recording and editing, which is often the most time-consuming part of the process.
* **Designs Everything:** To make your course look professional, the tool creates themes, graphics, and images. This means you don't need to be a designer or hire one to have a polished-looking final product that you can be proud to sell.
* **Sells For You:** A course is only valuable if you can sell it. This platform helps by building the sales page you need to promote your course. It also includes the functionality to handle payments from customers, so you don't have to figure out how to integrate complicated payment systems.
* **Builds Your Audience:** Getting your course in front of people is key. The tool has built-in features to help you share your course on social media and collect email addresses from interested people. This helps you build an email list, which is a valuable asset for any online business.

**Is This For You? Who Can Benefit**

A tool like this isn't for everyone, but it’s designed to help specific groups of people who face common challenges.

It could be a good fit for the expert who hates technology. Think of a life coach, a skilled tradesperson, or a fitness instructor who has years of valuable experience but freezes up at the thought of building a website or editing a video. For them, this tool could be the bridge that connects their knowledge to a wider audience without the technical headaches.

It’s also useful for the marketer who needs bonus content. Affiliate marketers or digital product sellers often need to create high-value bonuses to encourage people to buy through their links. Instead of spending weeks creating a bonus course from scratch, they could generate one in a fraction of the time, adding more value to their offers.

Finally, it could work for anyone looking for a side business without huge startup costs. If you want to generate income online but don't have thousands of dollars to invest upfront, this tool provides a way to create and sell digital products with a much lower initial investment of time and money.

[Create Your Course in a Coffee Break: A Review of AI Course Centric.](https://reddit.com/link/1m4kvx3/video/i46ugf5r10ef1/player)

**How It Works in 3 Simple Steps**

The process has been simplified to make it as straightforward as possible. Here’s the basic workflow:

1. **Access the platform.** After getting started, you log into the web-based application. There’s nothing to download or install.
2. **Type in your niche or topic.** This is the core step. You provide a keyword or a short phrase that describes the subject of your course. The AI takes it from there.
3. **Publish the AI-generated course.** The system generates the course content, videos, and sales page. After a final review, you can publish it and start sharing it with your audience.

[Try the 3-Step Process Now](https://softtechhub.us/Ai%20CourseCentric)

**My Own Test Drive: I Took It for a Spin**

As a beta tester, I had the chance to try out the platform before it was released to the public. I wanted to see if it lived up to its claims, so I decided to push it a bit. Instead of picking an easy, common topic, I chose a more challenging niche: ""Sustainable Beekeeping for Urban Gardeners."" It’s specific and requires some technical knowledge.

I typed the keyword into the system and let the AI do its work. In a surprisingly short amount of time, it generated a full course outline, complete with modules like ""Choosing the Right Beehive,"" ""Local Pollen Sources,"" and ""Harvesting Honey Safely."" It then populated these modules with written content and created a set of simple, informational slides for each lesson. Finally, it turned those slides into videos with an AI-generated voiceover.

My honest opinion? The speed is genuinely impressive. To have a complete, structured course ready in minutes is something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The quality of the content was a solid starting point. It was well-researched and logically organized. However, it lacked a personal voice and the unique insights that come from real-world experience. It was a great foundation, but it needed a human touch to take it from good to great. I would recommend anyone using this tool to read through the generated content, add their own stories and examples, and perhaps re-record the audio in their own voice to add authenticity. It’s a massive time-saver, but not a complete replacement for human expertise.

**Okay, But How Do You Actually Make Money With This?**

Creating the course is just the first step. Here are a few practical ways you could use this tool to generate income:

* **Selling your courses directly.** This is the most obvious path. You can create courses on popular topics—like digital marketing, fitness, or crafting—and sell them on your own website or through social media. You set the price and keep the profits.
* **Using free mini-courses to build an email list.** Not every course has to be sold. You could create a short, introductory course and give it away for free in exchange for an email address. This helps you build a list of people who are interested in your topic. You can then market other products or more advanced paid courses to that list in the future.
* **Creating courses for local businesses.** Many small businesses, like gyms, restaurants, or consulting firms, could benefit from having their own training courses for customers or employees. You could use AI Course Centric to create these courses for them and charge a fee for the service, effectively running your own mini-agency.

**How Is This Different From Just Using Udemy or YouTube?**

Platforms like Udemy and YouTube are fantastic, but they are marketplaces and hosting platforms, not creation tools. To put a course on Udemy or a video on YouTube, you still have to do all the upfront work yourself. You have to research, script, record, edit, and design everything from scratch. These platforms provide the stage, but you have to build the entire show.

AI Course Centric is different because its primary function is to automate the creation process itself. Its main advantage is speed and the removal of that initial workload. Instead of spending months creating a course before you can even think about uploading it somewhere, this tool lets you generate the course first and then decide what to do with it. You still own the content and can choose to sell it on your own site, use it as a bonus, or even upload the videos to YouTube. It tackles a different part of the problem.

**The Good Stuff vs. The ""Heads-Up"" Stuff (Pros and Cons)**

Every tool has its strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a balanced look.

**The Good:**

* **It’s extremely fast.** The ability to generate a full course from a keyword in minutes is its biggest selling point. It cuts down the creation time from months to minutes.
* **It’s beginner-friendly.** You don’t need to be a tech wizard to use it. The interface is simple, and the process is straightforward.
* **It’s a massive cost-saver.** It eliminates the need to hire designers, editors, and web developers, which can save you thousands of dollars in upfront costs.

**The Heads-Up:**

* **It's AI, so it needs your touch.** As with any AI-generated content, the output can sometimes be generic. To make your course truly stand out, you’ll want to review it, add your own personal stories and insights, and inject your own personality into the material. Think of it as a very skilled assistant, not a replacement for your own expertise.

**Platform, Support, and The Money-Back Policy**

AI Course Centric is a cloud-based tool, which means you can access it from any computer or mobile device with an internet connection. There’s no software to install or update.

If you run into any issues or have questions, there is a dedicated support team you can contact. You can submit a ticket through their support desk to get help.

The platform also comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. This means you can try it out, and if you're not satisfied with it or it doesn't work for you, you can request a full refund within the first 30 days of your purchase. This removes the financial risk of giving it a try.

**The Final Question: Should You Actually Get It?**

Now we come to the most important question. Is this tool the right choice for you?

To answer that, let’s go back to the beginning. Think about that great idea for a course that you might have had. Think about the walls that stood in your way. Was it the **Time Wall**? The thought of spending hundreds of hours you don't have on scripting and recording? Was it the **Money Wall**? The fear of spending thousands on designers and software before earning a dime? Or was it the **""Clue"" Wall**? The overwhelming feeling of not knowing how to build a website or handle the technical side of things?

If those are the problems that stopped you, then AI Course Centric is designed to be a direct solution. It was created specifically to break down those barriers. It won't make you an expert overnight, and it won't magically build a six-figure business without any effort. But it can give you a powerful head start. It can handle the 80% of grunt work that stops most people, leaving you with the 20% that matters most: adding your unique voice and expertise.

If you're willing to take the AI-generated foundation and polish it with your own personality, this tool could be the thing that finally helps you bring your course to life.

I made it about a month sugar free before traveling internationally. I thought I could have just a bit, and ended up relapsing. 

The thing that stood out to me was how much worse I felt afterwards. Not just nausea and bloating immediately after, but how hard it was to wake up in the morning and how much more depressed I felt. 

It's been hard to get back on track, especially because I am still traveling and out of my routine, but I'm already feeling so much better after just a few days without added sugar. I can't believe I have always lived my life feeling this way. I've reached a point where even when sugar sounds good, I think of how I will feel afterwards and don't even want it any more. I've struggled a lot with stomach issues, fatigue, and immune issues. So many of my stomach issues and fatigue issues are so much better when I even just limit sugar. 

  
I've been doing pretty loose sugar free right now, with no deserts or artificial/replacement sweeteners. However, I still eat carbs and fruits. I've had an eating disorder in the past, and I know that I can't be too strict about food things without relapsing into that, at least at this point in my life. 

The hardest part is not caving into things being in a different country. I love trying new foods, especially treats, but I've been making an effort to try new things (that just aren't sugar or a bakery item). 

If anyone has advice related to traveling, I'd love to hear it! I'm in the same place for about a month and have access to a kitchen, so I've been cooking and making my own morning coffee at home. ",1,1753004248.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

It's like my head's a siren but my heart's requesting a slow dance. I know they say to trust your gut, but what if your gut's checked out for coffee, leaving your head and heart to duke it out? Just wondering if anyone's navigated this high-stakes chess match between emotions and logic. Sometimes I think my brain's too pragmatic for its own good, but maybe I'm just overthinking... again.

How do I confront him about it??,"For background, 1 month ago, my ex (24M) broke up with me after being together for 6 years. At first, I wasn't ready to break up so we took a 3-week break, but after talking again I realized that it's best if we break up so that we can both work on ourselves. We ended it on good terms and are open to being friends again in the future. These past 2 months have been really hard but I've been trying to work on myself so that I can create my own happiness and don't need to rely on others for that. I'm starting to feel better!

2 days ago, I went clubbing with my friends and bumped into one of my ex's childhood friend. He tapped me on the shoulder and I only recognized him the second time. He came to the club alone with crutches which I thought was pretty funny so I talked to him a bit and invited him to dance with the rest of us. He asked where my ex was and I told him that we broke up. We all had fun dancing and then my friends and I decided to go home so we went outside. One of my friends (24F) wanted to take a picture together with me and my ex's friend and she later on posted it on her close friends story (she also thought the crutches were funny).

Last night, my ex's friend texted me, asking if I was going out and if I wanted to go to this other club. I went to bed early so I didn't see his message until this morning, to which I basically said ""Thanks for inviting me, I'd love to go clubbing again in a few weeks, I'm down to call on discord or grab coffee to catch up with you"". Here's what I think of this guy, based on the few times he hung out with my ex and what I've seen him post on social media: he's very weird and he often makes himself look very desperate for attention/connection, but I can tell that he's a nice person. He doesn't strike me as someone with malicious intent, he's just going through some stuff and is coping with it in questionable ways. That's kind of what my ex thought of him as well and they haven't been very close since he started to act really weird. So the reason why I invited him for coffee was just to catch up with him as friends. I also invited my other friend with whom we took a picture together.

After I finished talking to my ex's friend, my ex texted me saying there is something absolutely hilarious he has to show me. It was screenshots of his conversation with his friend saying that I was hitting on him but he likes my friend better. He said that I'm planning dates with him and that I'm trying to be the 'game master' by inviting my friend as well so that I can see which one he will chose??????? He said ""this is not squid game""?????????????????? I was speechless. My ex was like ""I don't know what you did but I'm sure it's not what he thinks it is"". I feel so relieved that my ex doesn't actually think that I was hitting on him.

Now, I feel really conflicted and not sure of how I should confront my ex's friend. My mom was saying that I should tell him to not go around and spread lies about me because I am NOT interested in him. My friend who was gonna come with me to get coffee was saying that I should make up an excuse to not go. I don't feel comfortable with seeing him anymore but I'm not sure if calling it off without an explanation is the right thing to do. He's clearly lonely and has some serious issues, but it seems like everyone gave up on him. To be honest, what I want to do is ask him why he thinks I'm hitting on him and tell him why I was friendly to him. I saw the good in him and I kind of felt sorry for him that he doesn't have many close friends. I was hoping that we could be good friends but instead he decided to brag about it to my ex. I still don't know how I would phrase it though.

If anyone has had a similar experience, I would love to hear your opinion! I'm just looking for some ideas of how to deal with this.

Eighteen days after giving up on Brendan Maynard, Jayde Rosario cut off her waist-length hair and called her father, announcing her decision to move to California and attend UC Berkeley.  
Her father, surprised, asked about the sudden change, reminding her how she'd always insisted on staying with Brendan. Jayde forced a laugh, revealing the painful truth: Brendan was getting married, and she, his stepsister, could no longer cling to him.  
That night, she tried to tell Brendan about her college acceptance, but his fiancée, Chloie Ellis, interrupted with a bubbly call, and Brendan's tender words to Chloie twisted a knife in Jayde's heart. She remembered how his tenderness used to be hers alone, how he had protected her, and how she had poured out her heart to him in a diary and a love letter, only for him to explode, tearing the letter and yelling, ""I'm your brother!""  
He had stormed out, leaving her to painstakingly tape the shredded pieces back together. Her love, however, didn't die, not even when he brought Chloie home and told her to call her ""sister-in-law.""  
Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.  
  
**Chapter 1**  
Eighteen days after she decided to give up on Brendan Maynard, Jayde Rosario cut off her waist-length hair. She stood in front of the mirror and smoked her first cigarette, the sm\*\*e curling around her fingers. The taste was bitter.  
  
That night, she called her father across the country.  
  
""Dad, I got into UC Berkeley.""  
  
Her voice was quiet.  
  
""I want to move to California. I want to be with you again.""  
  
Her father, Farrell Conner, sounded surprised on the other end of the line. ""After your mom and I divorced, I settled down here. I always asked you to come over as an exchange student, but you insisted on staying with your step-brother, Brendan. Why the sudden change?""  
  
Jayde lowered her eyes, which were red and swollen. She forced a small, light laugh.  
  
""Some paths you have to walk to the end to know they're dead ends.""  
  
She paused, her voice shaking slightly.  
  
""Brendan is getting married. It's not right for me, his sister with no bl\*\*d relation, to cling to him anymore.""  
  
Her father sighed, his voice full of sympathy. ""It's good you've figured it out. Your mom and Mr. Maynard have been traveling the world, leaving you with Brendan all these years. You're grown up now. It's time to come live with me. You can study and learn to manage the company.""  
  
""Okay,"" Jayde said, then hung up.  
  
She saw her swollen eyes in the reflection of the dark phone screen. She went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face. She had two weeks until she left for Berkeley. She had to pull herself together.  
  
She walked down the hallway and noticed the light was on in the study. She hesitated for a moment, then pulled up her e-acceptance letter on her phone and knocked on the door.  
  
""Knock, knock, knock.""  
  
Inside, Brendan Maynard sat at his desk. He wore dark blue silk loungewear, and his high nose supported a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He looked elegant, aloof, and disciplined as he typed on his computer.  
  
""Brendan,"" Jayde said softly. This was the man who was her step-brother. He was also the secret, hidden crush of her entire teenage life.  
  
Brendan looked up from his screen, his brow furrowed in a slight frown. ""Something wrong?""  
  
Jayde pursed her lips, hesitating. ""The college admission results are out...""  
  
Before she could finish, a cute, bubbly ringtone cut through the quiet room. ""Darling, answer the phone\~""  
  
Brendan's frown vanished instantly. He picked up his phone, and a gentle smile spread across his face as he listened to the person on the other end.  
  
""Chloie, you can work directly with the wedding planner. Just tell them to arrange whatever designs you want. Remember, money is no object.""  
  
A sharp bitterness filled Jayde's ch\*\*t. Brendan's tenderness used to belong only to her.  
  
When she was eight, her remarried mother brought her to the Maynard household. She stood awkwardly in the grand mansion, lost and alone. Young Brendan, dressed in his British-style school uniform, had walked over and taken her hand. ""Little girl, I'm your brother now,"" he'd said.  
  
When she was ten, she was afraid of the dark. Brendan secretly used his allowance to buy her a Totoro nightlight. ""Don't be scared,"" he'd told her. ""I'll protect you, just like Totoro protects Mei.""  
  
During her teenage years, Brendan was the sun in her world. She didn't know how to tell him about the love she kept hidden, so she wrote it all down in a diary, over and over again.  
  
Then, on her seventeenth birthday, just before Brendan graduated from college, she gave him everything. She gave him the diary filled with her feelings and a love letter where she poured out her heart.  
  
That day, Brendan exploded. He flipped the gift box over, sending its contents scattering across the floor.  
  
""Jayde Rosario, are you sick? I'm your brother!"" he had yelled.  
  
But she had been stubborn. ""We're not related by bl\*\*d. You're not my real brother. You've pampered me and protected me and cared for me all these years. Isn't it natural for me to fall in love with you?""  
  
Her stubbornness was met with cruelty. He mercilessly tore the love letter into pieces.  
  
""I knew you'd do something foolish. I shouldn't have bothered with you all these years! You can't even tell the difference between family affection and romantic love!""  
  
He stormed out of the house that day without a second glance. Jayde cried as she picked up the shredded pieces from the floor. She took them to her room and painstakingly taped them back together. But the letter was scarred, a patchwork of its former self.  
  
Her failed confession didn't k\*\*l her love for him. She studied harder, determined to get into the same university he attended, to stay in the same city.  
  
But on the day she finished high school, Brendan brought a woman named Chloie Ellis home.  
  
""Jayde, call her 'sister-in-law',"" he'd said.  
  
That night, Jayde cried until she couldn't breathe. She finally understood that the ninety-nine steps she had taken through thorns to reach him meant nothing. She and Brendan would only ever be siblings. There was no other possibility.  
  
The intense love that had burned in her heart for years now felt like a fire that was burning her alive.  
  
Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.  
  
**Chapter 2**  
Watching Brendan still on the phone with Chloie Ellis, his voice soft and loving, Jayde Rosario swallowed the words she had come to say. She turned and quietly left the study.  
  
To him, she was just a stepsister living in his house. He wouldn't care where she went to college. If that was the case, she didn't need to tell him.  
  
In fifteen days, she would leave the Maynard home. She would leave Brendan.  
  
Back in her room, Jayde looked at the warm glow of the Totoro nightlight on her bedside table. A flicker of sadness crossed her face. The chubby Totoro holding a green leaf umbrella over a little girl looked just like how Brendan used to shield her. But the past was the past.  
  
She sighed softly and switched off the nightlight. The room went dark.  
  
""Since I've decided to go, it's time to pack,"" she murmured to herself.  
  
She pulled an old duffel bag from the top of her closet and opened the large, wall-to-wall display cabinet. Inside the glass-fronted shelves were all the memories. The good luck charms Brendan had brought her from the temple. The Coral Sea perfume he had specially blended for her on a trip to France.  
  
One by one, she took them all out and placed them in the duffel bag. The bag slowly filled up, but her heart felt like it was emptying, a hollow space where a cold wind was blowing.  
  
She pushed down the sadness and opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet. A yellowed diary lay inside. The pages were filled with childish pencil scribbles from her turbulent childhood.  
  
  
  
She remembered how Brendan had found her diary back then. He had read that page and gently st\*\*ked her head. ""Silly girl, you're not a jinx,"" he'd said. ""You're a star in my eyes. You sparkle brighter than anyone.""  
  
After that day, no one at school ever called her names again. She later found out that Brendan had gone to the school and quietly warned those children. He had protected her childhood in his own quiet way.  
  
As she flipped through the diary, the pencil handwriting became neater. Every single page was about Brendan.  
  
She turned page after page, her eyes blurring with tears. The last page held a note from him from when she was choosing her subjects in high school.  
  
  
  
A tear fell silently onto the diary, blurring the ink.  
  
Jayde pulled herself together, pushing down the complicated knot of feelings in her ch\*\*t. Then, she started tearing the pages out of the diary. She tore up the letters, too. With each rip of the paper, a memory of her and Brendan seemed to fade.  
  
She threw all the shredded pieces into the duffel bag and zipped it shut.  
  
A while later, she heard a commotion downstairs. She walked out of her room and saw Chloie Ellis in the living room, hugging Brendan. A suitcase stood beside her.  
  
Jayde's heart stuttered, and she froze on the landing.  
  
Seeing her, Chloie smiled and waved. ""Jayde! I'm moving in for a few days. I brought you a gift!""  
  
Chloie opened an ornate box she was holding. ""See if you like it.""  
  
Inside was a pink wristwatch with a metal strap. It was cute, with a bit of a British style.  
  
Jayde frowned. She didn't reach for it. She had been allergic to metal since she was a child. When she was nine, a nanny had given her a metal spoon to eat with. She'd only gotten a small rash, but Brendan had fired the nanny on the spot. He had every metal item that might touch her skin replaced. He didn't allow any of her allergens near her.  
  
As she was lost in thought, Brendan's voice cut through the air. ""Hurry up and take it. Don't disappoint your sister-in-law.""  
  
His words hit her hard. She stared at his matter-of-fact expression, a wave of sadness washing over her. He hadn't just taken back all his favoritism. He had forgotten her completely.  
  
Jayde took a deep breath. She took the box and put the watch on her wrist.  
  
""Thank you, sister-in-law. And... thank you, Brendan.""  
  
Thank you for making my decision to leave even easier.  
  
**Chapter 3**  
That night, Chloie Ellis sl\*\*t in Brendan Maynard's room.  
  
Jayde knew they were a couple. She knew it was normal for them to stay together. But the quiet, ambiguous sounds that floated through the house in the dead of night kept her awake.  
  
She lit another cigarette, watching the sm\*\*e curl around her slender fingers before taking a deep drag. It tasted bitter and acrid, just like her feelings.  
  
The next morning, Jayde came downstairs with swollen eyes.  
  
""Jayde!"" Chloie called out, pulling her to sit on the sofa. A faint red mark was visible on Chloie's neck. ""Your brother's birthday is coming up. I want to throw him a party. Do you know what style he likes?""  
  
Chloie's question pulled Jayde back to the present. She couldn't help but remember a conversation she and Brendan had once had while walking on the beach.  
  
She had told him she loved the sparkling ocean, the sound of the waves, and holding his hand as they walked on the sand while the sun rose. That day, Brendan had held her hand and walked with her for a long, long time.  
  
""Kid, you like the beach,"" he'd said. ""So from now on, our birthday parties will be by the sea. What you like is what I like.""  
  
Back then, his world revolved around her. Now, he avoided her. He had forgotten everything she liked.  
  
A bitter feeling spread through her ch\*\*t. It took her a moment to find her voice. ""I...""  
  
She was about to speak when Brendan walked over and interrupted her. ""My affairs, you should ask me.""  
  
Chloie clung to his arm, whining. ""I just thought, since you're a girl, you'd know him better. It seems like even his sister doesn't really know him.""  
  
Jayde forced a smile. ""Yes. I really don't.""  
  
""You two talk. I have to go,"" she said, suppressing the bitterness. She turned to leave, but Brendan's eyes darkened.  
  
""It's early in the morning. What could you possibly have to do?""  
  
His cold voice made her heart stop for a second. Did he still care what she did?  
  
Jayde answered truthfully. ""I have an appointment to get my visa today.""  
  
As soon as she said it, Chloie looked surprised. ""Going on a trip? With friends? Or a boyfriend?""  
  
Brendan frowned at Jayde, his tone full of accusation. ""Jayde Rosario, you just finished high school. Don't get involved with the wrong kind of people before you even start college.""  
  
The cold reprimand felt like a physical blow. It left her with no strength to explain.  
  
In the silence, Chloie smoothed things over. ""It's normal for a young girl to date. Brendan, don't be so harsh.""  
  
Then she turned to Jayde, her voice soft and comforting. ""If you like someone, you should love boldly. You only get to be eighteen once. Don't listen to your brother.""  
  
Chloie then took Brendan's hand and they left together. Watching them walk away, Jayde slowly clenched her fists.  
  
She only had one eighteen, and she had already given it to Brendan.  
  
Fourteen days left. Then she would leave. She wouldn't let her youth get buried in this swamp where no one noticed her.  
  
Jayde left the house. It was foggy outside, a light drizzle falling. Even though it was summer, the rain made her shiver.  
  
In the past, on every rainy day, Brendan would drive her himself. ""My little girl can't get wet,"" he would say. ""My arms are your shelter.""  
  
But now, she had to get used to walking alone.  
  
She lowered her gaze and walked out into the rain with her umbrella.  
  
After getting her visa, she was about to call a cab when she saw a notification on her phone. A special notification, from Brendan's social media. Her finger moved on its own, clicking on it.  
  
Brendan, who usually posted something once every six months, had a new status.  
  
  
  
The photo was of him in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, embracing Chloie Ellis, who was in a mermaid-style wedding dress. He was smiling gently at the camera.  
  
The simple sentence and the wedding photo shocked Jayde. Her eyes, already red, burned. The comment section was filled with congratulations. People were saying they were a perfect match, a pair made in heaven.  
  
Jayde stared at the screen, feeling nothing. The usual ache in her ch\*\*t wasn't there.  
  
She calmly typed a comment.  
  
  
  
**Chapter 4**  
After posting the comment, Jayde Rosario unfollowed Brendan Maynard's social media. The days until she left were counting down. She would use this time to dig him out of her heart, piece by piece.  
  
She returned to the hillside mansion. The house was empty, and a chill hung in the air. She went into the kitchen and cooked herself a simple bowl of egg noodles.  
  
While she was eating, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Chloie Ellis.  
  
  
  
A moment later, Chloie sent several more photos. A candlelit dinner. A mirror selfie in a fancy hotel suite.  
  
Jayde's fingertips trembled slightly as she looked at the pictures. She calmly replied with one word.  
  
""Okay.""  
  
She closed the chat, and a notification popped up from her high school group chat. Someone had tagged her. She clicked on it and saw her classmates were planning a graduation party for the weekend.  
  
She thought about it. Once she moved to California, she probably wouldn't come back to the country very often. She agreed to go.  
  
Her reply instantly brought the group chat to life.  
  
  
  
  
  
The messages from her classmates filled her mind with memories of a time when she felt safe and warm. But now, those warm feelings were like shards of ice, piercing her heart with every breath.  
  
Jayde put her phone down and replied with three words.  
  
  
  
Her classmates' idea of Brendan was stuck in the past, in the years when he spoiled her completely. They didn't know about the confession he had rejected when she was seventeen. And they didn't know that the man who had promised to protect her had found someone else to protect.  
  
That night, Jayde sl\*\*t restlessly. In her dream, she was eight years old again, standing awkwardly by the fountain on her first day at the Maynard home. She didn't know what to do.  
  
In the dream, young Brendan, in his plaid school uniform, glanced at her indifferently. Then he turned and walked away with his backpack, without saying a single word.  
  
She woke with a start, her face wet with tears that had stained her pillow.  
  
If Brendan had been that cold to her from the very beginning, maybe she would have understood the distance between them sooner.  
  
But there were no ""if onlys."" The hardest thing in the world wasn't never having something. It was having all the favoritism, and then losing it all overnight.  
  
When she got up, she looked at the duffel bag in the corner of her room, full of memories. Thirteen days left. Thirteen days until she truly left this place.  
  
Whether she wanted to or not, she had to throw these memories away. Only by getting rid of them completely could she clear the space in her heart.  
  
Jayde took a deep breath, picked up the heavy duffel bag, and walked out of her room.  
  
As she was about to go downstairs, she saw Brendan and Chloie Ellis had just returned.  
  
Brendan frowned when he saw the bag in her hand. ""School hasn't started yet. Where are you going with that luggage?""  
  
Jayde tightened her grip on the strap. ""I'll be living on campus later, so I packed some useless things to throw away.""  
  
She struggled to carry the heavy bag down the stairs.  
  
Brendan didn't say anything. He just strode forward, took the bag from her, and walked outside. He threw it directly into the large tr\*\*h receptacle by the curb.  
  
The clattering sound it made as it landed made Jayde's heart sink. If he cared even a little, he would have heard the sound of the wind chimes made from seashells from the Aegean Sea inside the bag.  
  
What he threw away were the gifts he had flown halfway around the world to bring her over the years. They were also the memories they had once promised they would never forget.  
  
But Brendan didn't even glance at the tr\*\*h. His gaze was fixed straight ahead.  
  
""You're going to college in the city. There's no need to live on campus. Stay at home after school starts. I'll talk to your teacher.""  
  
His tone was unquestionable. It filled Jayde with a mix of emotions. If he had just asked her high school teacher, he would have known she hadn't even applied to any colleges in the city. She had applied directly to the University of California, Berkeley, thousands of miles away.  
  
But his mind was on Chloie Ellis now. He didn't care about her future at all.  
  
It didn't matter. Only thirteen days left. Once she was in California, she wouldn't need his attention.  
  
Thinking this, she turned and went back upstairs without a word.  
  
Behind her, she heard Chloie asking quietly, ""Is Jayde mad because we didn't come home last night?""  
  
Brendan's voice was cold. ""She's eighteen now. She should learn to be independent. No one can stay with her forever.""  
  
Jayde paused on the stairs, then continued to her room.  
  
Yes, she was eighteen. She wouldn't miss the past. And she wouldn't hope for the future. From now on, she could walk her own path, all by herself.  
  
**Chapter 5**  
For the next few days, Jayde Rosario stayed in her room. She didn't leave from morning until night. Brendan Maynard took Chloie Ellis out early every day and came back late, and sometimes they didn't come home at all. Their lives no longer seemed to intersect.  
  
Sunday arrived. Ten days before she was set to leave. It was also the day of her high school reunion.  
  
At a bar by the sea, as soon as Jayde walked into the private room, a few of her close friends handed her a drink.  
  
""You're eighteen now. Let's say goodbye to being kids and legally have our first drink.""  
  
Jayde paused for a moment. People said al\*\*hol could drown your sorrows, and she wanted to relax. This drink was a farewell to her friends, a final toast.  
  
After one drink, she felt a little dizzy. She went out to the corridor to get some fresh air. As she passed an open private room, she unexpectedly saw Brendan. He was surrounded by a group of men and women, laughing and talking.  
  
Her heart skipped a beat. She forced herself to look away, but the conversation from inside the room made her stop.  
  
""Brendan, you're about to get engaged to Chloie. What about your sister, Jayde Rosario? She used to follow you everywhere.""  
  
""She's an adult now. She's not my responsibility anymore.""  
  
The clear, familiar voice reached her ears, and it sobered her up a little. She stood at the doorway, her eyes lowered, not moving for a long moment.  
  
After what felt like a long time, she murmured to herself and continued walking down the corridor.  
  
""Yes, she's an adult. She's sensible. From now on, my world won't have you in it, either.""  
  
Jayde went to the window at the end of the corridor to get some air. Then she went to the restroom and splashed cold water on her face. When she came out, she ran right into Brendan. He seemed to have had a few drinks himself.  
  
Their eyes met.  
  
Jayde was about to speak, but Chloie Ellis's voice came from behind him. ""Brendan.""  
  
She called out his name sweetly, then threw herself into his arms. ""I drank too much. I can barely walk.""  
  
Brendan ki\*\*ed her on the forehead, his voice doting. ""Then I'll carry you.""  
  
With that, he scooped Chloie up into his arms in a princess carry and walked away, as if Jayde wasn't even there.  
  
Their in\*\*mate display left Jayde frozen in place for a long time.  
  
""Jayde, why are you crying?"" Her friend, Brielle Steele, asked, pulling her back to reality.  
  
Jayde froze, then forced a faint smile. ""It's just an eyelash in my eye. It's nothing.""  
  
Brielle nodded, then pointed in the direction Brendan had gone. ""Is that your brother? He actually has a girlfriend now. We all thought he'd never date. We thought he'd always stay with you, because he used to dote on you so much.""  
  
Hearing this, Jayde felt a slight bitterness in her heart. ""He and I both have our own lives. We won't be tied together forever.""  
  
Brielle's face showed a hint of regret. ""Actually, we all used to think he was your boyfriend. You two looked so good together. It's just a shame he's your brother...""  
  
Jayde's heart felt heavy and damp. She used to think it was a shame, too. But now she felt that the bonds between people were just fate. She and Brendan used to be siblings. From now on, they would have no relationship at all.  
  
The reunion ended at one in the morning. Jayde said goodbye to her friends and walked out of the bar. She saw Brendan and Chloie standing by the revolving door, looking like they were waiting for her.  
  
""You're an adult now, and you're still out past midnight. You're getting more and more out of control. What if something happens?""  
  
The reprimand froze her in place.  
  
Chloie glanced at Brendan reproachfully. ""Jayde has you to protect her now, and later she'll have her boyfriend to protect her. What could possibly happen?""  
  
""Let's go home together,"" Chloie said, taking Brendan's hand and walking out. She motioned for Jayde to follow.  
  
Jayde followed behind them, her eyes on the ground. Only when they stepped outside did she realize it was drizzling again.  
  
Brendan opened his umbrella and walked forward with Chloie, not looking back. The large umbrella was tilted to the right, shielding Chloie completely from the rain, while half of his own shirt was dark with water.  
  
Jayde watched them in a daze. She suddenly remembered how Brendan used to hold his umbrella for her. He always tilted it towards her.  
  
""Jayde is my delicate rose,"" he used to say. ""Roses can't get wet. I'll always protect you.""  
  
A gust of wind blew, and the slanted raindrops fell onto Jayde's white dress, bringing a chill with them.  
  
Jayde came back to her senses and slowly walked out into the rain alone.  
  
Roses can't get wet, but I want to be my own sunflower. Always facing the sun, always bright.  
  
**Chapter 6**  
When she got home, Jayde Rosario was soaked from the rain. She felt drowsy and heavy. After a hot shower, she collapsed into bed and fell asleep immediately.  
  
For the past few days, she had been alone in the mansion. She was already getting used to it. She no longer tried to ask about Brendan Maynard's whereabouts.  
  
""Ding.""  
  
Her phone chimed with a message. She picked it up and saw it was from her father, Farrell Conner.  
  
  
  
Jayde clicked on her phone's calendar. She murmured to herself, ""Only seven days until I leave this home.""  
  
Her calendar for seven days from now had an entry: .  
  
Maybe her departure was the best birthday gift she could give him.  
  
Over the next two days, Jayde went through her luggage again, making sure she had everything. Then she packed up all the old things she couldn't take with her and arranged for a donation pick-up service.  
  
As the courier was making a list of the items and preparing to pack them into boxes, Brendan returned home.  
  
""What's going on?"" he asked, his eyes on the piles of clothes and books.  
  
Jayde filled out the donation form and motioned for the courier to take the bags first. ""I arranged for old clothes to be picked up. I'm clearing out things I don't use.""  
  
Her voice was calm and empty of emotion. It made Brendan frown. He had felt that Jayde was different lately, but he couldn't quite figure out what had changed. A strange feeling was growing inside him, a sense of emptiness he couldn't explain.  
  
""Chloie and I have been staying at the Blue Sea Apartments downtown,"" he said, changing the subject. ""It's quieter there and more convenient for work.""  
  
Jayde just nodded slightly. The Blue Sea Apartments, without her there, would indeed be quieter.  
  
She watched as Brendan started gathering some of his and Chloie's things, preparing to leave again. On impulse, she asked, ""Brendan, your birthday is next Friday. Can I attend?""  
  
Jayde had meticulously prepared a gift for Brendan's birthday every single year. This year would have been the tenth year. Ten. A perfect number. She wanted to see it through one last time.  
  
Brendan had shielded her for ten years. She wanted to say a proper goodbye.  
  
""We'll see,"" Brendan said, unwilling to commit. He pushed his suitcase toward the door and left.  
  
The heavy sound of the door closing made Jayde's heart tremble slightly. Her eyes reddened.  
  
Back in her room, she instinctively reached for the drawer in her bedside table, wanting to look at the love letters she had written to him. But when she opened it, the drawer was empty. She had already thrown away those brief but heartfelt letters. Only a faded sketchpad lay at the bottom of the drawer.  
  
Jayde carefully took out the old sketchpad and gently opened it. The yellowed pages each showed Brendan in a different moment.  
  
Brendan in his plaid school uniform, holding her hand, saying, ""Kid, I'm taking you home.""  
  
Brendan on the highest podium, holding a trophy, hanging the gold medal around her neck. He had said, ""Kid, you're my badge of honor.""  
  
Brendan at a formal banquet, holding a w\*\*e glass, in complete control, sending a thornless rose over to her table. He had said, ""Kid, roses need time to bloom. I'll wait for you to grow up.""  
  
Every drawing was a memory etched deep in her mind.  
  
But it didn't matter anymore. She would scrape those memories clean from her heart, bit by bit.  
  
She turned to the last page of the sketchpad. It was blank. Jayde remembered that every year on Brendan's birthday, she would secretly draw a picture of the two of them together. She thought she would draw one this year, too.  
  
But this year, the people in the drawing would be Brendan and Chloie Ellis.  
  
This time, she genuinely wished them well.  
  
She drew meticulously, st\*\*ke by st\*\*ke, with great care. She didn't stop until the sun began to set.  
  
Then, she heard the sound of a key in the front door.  
  
Jayde went out to the living room and saw Brendan stumble in. He smelled strongly of al\*\*hol.  
  
""Brendan, why did you drink so much?"" Seeing his unsteady steps, she quickly went to help him.  
  
Brendan leaned heavily on her, his large hand wrapping naturally around her waist. The strong scent of al\*\*hol mixed with his familiar woody cologne filled her senses.  
  
Jayde froze. She wanted to step back, to create some distance, but the next moment, Brendan pulled her into his embrace.  
  
His restless hand slipped under her clothes, and his burning, al\*\*hol-fueled k\*\*s landed forcefully on her lips.  
  
**Chapter 7**  
Jayde Rosario's mind went completely blank.  
  
This was the scene she had dreamed of countless times, but now it was happening, real and overwhelming. A rough hand moved over her ch\*\*t, sending a jolt through her body that made her pull back, struggling against him.  
  
""Brendan...""  
  
Her struggle only seemed to make him more forceful.  
  
""Chloie, be good..."" Brendan's passion-filled murmur exploded next to her ear like a clap of thunder.  
  
In a daze, she felt herself being lifted. The man carried her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed.  
  
It was only then, as she landed on the soft mattress, that she truly woke up from the intoxicating k\*\*s.  
  
""Brendan Maynard, look closely! I'm Jayde Rosario! I am not Chloie Ellis!""  
  
Jayde's voice trembled with a pain that was sharp and heartbreaking.  
  
Brendan stopped. His eyes, clouded with drunkenness, glanced at her. Then he simply pulled her into his arms and held her, doing nothing else.  
  
Jayde tried to get up, but Brendan's hoarse voice whispered in her ear.  
  
""Don't go.""  
  
Her body went stiff. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. Was he asking her to stay? Or did he still think she was Chloie Ellis?  
  
Deep, even breathing sounds came from beside her. Brendan had closed his eyes and fallen asleep.  
  
A sudden, suffocating feeling of powerlessness washed over her. She tried to break free from his arms, but his grip was too strong. She couldn't escape.  
  
Her head felt heavy, and the lingering smell of al\*\*hol on his breath made her even dizzier. An overwhelming fatigue washed over her, and she fell into a dazed sl\*\*p.  
  
The next morning, the first thing Jayde saw when she opened her eyes was Brendan. He was standing by the bed, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.  
  
""Jayde Rosario, why are you in my bed?""  
  
The events of last night flooded her mind, and her face flushed with heat. She instinctively opened her mouth to speak, but Brendan cut her off.  
  
""If this happens again, you'll move to the school dorms. And you will never enter my room again!""  
  
The man's reprimand was mixed with disappointment and disgust. It made Jayde swallow any explanation she might have had.  
  
""I'm sorry,"" she said quietly. ""It won't happen again.""  
  
She knew that even if she told him the truth, he wouldn't believe her. In his eyes, she was just his stepsister who had inappropriate feelings for him.  
  
It didn't matter. Only five days left. In five days, she would be in California. From now on, she wouldn't just avoid his room; she would disappear from his world forever.  
  
Jayde got out of bed, pulling her messy clothes together, and walked out of the room.  
  
Just as she stepped into the hallway, she ran into Chloie Ellis coming up the stairs.  
  
""Jayde, why are you coming out of your brother's room so early in the morning?!"" Chloie's voice was sharp with shock.  
  
Jayde's face turned pale. She was flustered and didn't know what to say. She avoided Chloie's gaze and fled back to her own room.  
  
But as soon as she entered, Chloie followed her in, slamming the door shut behind her.  
  
""You were in your brother's room all night. What did you do?"" Chloie stared at her, her eyes filled with a dark, scrutinizing light.  
  
""We're both women. I've always known how you feel about your brother. I thought you knew your place, but I never expected you to be so shameless. You took advantage of him when he was drunk and climbed into his bed!""  
  
Chloie's words were filled with blatant disgust.  
  
Jayde lowered her head. She knew any explanation would be useless. ""Last night, he and I didn't...""  
  
Before she could finish, Chloie interrupted her sharply. ""He and I had a fight yesterday, and that gave you an opportunity. But we are getting married soon. If you pull another disgusting stunt like this, I will make sure you leave the Maynard family forever!""  
  
After her threat, Chloie glared at Jayde one last time, then turned and slammed the door as she left.  
  
Jayde slowly slid down the wall to the floor. She felt as if all her strength had been drained from her body, leaving her weak and helpless.  
  
Brendan's reprimand and Chloie's warning were like an invisible hand, gripping her heart and squeezing tight.  
  
Large tears rolled down her face uncontrollably. The emotions she had suppressed for so long finally shattered.  
  
Jayde covered her mouth with her hands, letting the tears flow silently through her fingers.  
  
**Chapter 8**  
After some time, Jayde Rosario heard the roar of a car engine outside. She looked out the window and saw that Brendan Maynard had driven away with Chloie Ellis. She calmly looked away from the window, curled up on her bed, and hugged herself tightly.  
  
The next morning, her phone rang, breaking the silence in her room. The screen displayed 'Mom'. Jayde hesitated for a moment before answering.  
  
""Mom...""  
  
She had barely spoken when her mother, Glenna Taylor's, angry voice came through the phone. ""Brendan and I were traveling for a month, and you cause a scandal like this. Your brother is getting married, and you're still trying to climb into his bed! Jayde Rosario, do you have no shame? Get out of there! Don't live with your brother anymore!""  
  
A wave of immense sorrow washed over Jayde. When she was little, her family had gone bankrupt. Her parents divorced. Her father went to California, and her mother remarried into the Maynard family, bringing her along.  
  
Her mother always said she was a burden. She said that because of Jayde, she couldn't have another child with Mr. Maynard. Over the years, her mother had rarely shown any care for her. The only two times she had actively 'cared'were to blame her.  
  
Once, when she confessed to Brendan, her mother had called and screamed at her, calling her shameless.  
  
Today, her mother was accusing her of climbing into Brendan's bed, saying she had no shame.  
  
""Mom, you didn't even ask what happened. You're just certain I was the one who initiated it?"" Jayde asked, her voice trembling.  
  
The phone was silent for a moment. Then her mother's disgusted voice came again. ""We're both women. Don't think I don't know what you're thinking! If you affect my standing in the Maynard family, you can go find your dad!""  
  
After saying that, her mother hung up.  
  
The black screen of the phone reflected Jayde's lost and haggard face. She bit her l\*p hard, refusing to let the tears fall.  
  
Looking at the word 'Mom'on her phone's contact list, she thought silently, Mom, don't worry. This daughter you dislike will completely leave the Maynard family, and you, in just 4 days.  
  
For the next few days, Brendan didn't come home. Jayde was busy with her own preparations for going abroad and didn't pay any attention to where he and Chloie had gone.  
  
Until 11:59 PM on August 24th. One minute before Brendan's birthday.  
  
Jayde opened her social media and clicked on the only contact she had pinned. But after staring at the screen for a long time, she closed the chat. This was the first time in ten years she hadn't wished him a happy birthday.  
  
At 8:00 AM the next morning, a flight reminder popped up on her phone.  
  
  
  
She calculated the time. She had only 12 hours left before she had to leave.  
  
She found herself opening her social media again. She saw a new post from Chloie Ellis.  
  
  
  
The post included a photo of her and Brendan holding hands at a place called Rose Coast.  
  
Jayde's eyelashes fluttered. Her heart was calmer than she had expected.  
  
At that moment, Chloie sent her a direct message.  
  
  
  
Below the text was a 10-second video. In the video, Brendan was wearing a bathrobe, lying on a large, couple's-themed waterbed in a hotel room. Chloie was lying beside him, her shoulder exposed from under the blanket, covered in ambiguous red marks.  
  
Jayde didn't need to think to know what kind of pa\*\*ionate night they had just had.  
  
She just twitched her lips, quietly exited the social media app, and then began to reconfirm and clear out all of her belongings in the house.  
  
4 hours left.  
  
Jayde took the entire sketchpad from her drawer and tore her drawings of Brendan into tiny pieces, one by one. The shredded paper went into the tr\*\*h can, and the memories in her mind were cleared out, bit by bit.  
  
3 hours left.  
  
She threw out all her remaining personal items in the house, leaving no trace that she had ever lived there.  
  
2 hours left.  
  
She took the Totoro nightlight from her bedside table and placed it on the living room coffee table. She put it on top of the drawing she had made of Brendan and Chloie. It would be her last wedding gift to him, from his sister.  
  
When she was eight, Brendan had been a light in her life. But from now on, she would be her own light.  
  
Because she was a sunflower, no longer someone's rose.  
  
1 hour left.  
  
She left a small message in the bottom right corner of the sketch.  
  
  
  
  
  
Birds and fish travel different paths. Mountains and rivers will not meet again.  
  
After that, Jayde picked up her phone. She deleted Brendan and Chloie Ellis as friends and deactivated her social media account. Then she did a full factory reset on her phone, erasing everything.  
  
The whole process was done without a single moment of hesitation.  
  
Having done all that, Jayde took one last look at the home she had lived in for ten years.  
  
Then she turned and headed straight for the airport.  
  
The plane roared into the sky.

I'm also considering chemical castration.

First and foremost, I only have 3 friends. One online and two of them I've been friends with since 4th grade and we're now living together. Everything is supposed to be perfect. I'm in my junior year of college and taking summer courses, I have a job, I'm living with friends, playing guitar, skateboarding, playing video games, yet the complete isolation and loneliness is just becoming too much.

I feel like one of the biggest problems which I cannot figure out is just how to go about meeting women in general. I'm only 20, I can't go to bars or pretty much do anything downtown since everywhere is 21+, and the only activities that are 18+ are clubs which makes me incredibly overstimulated. I thought about going to libraries, coffee shops, and parks but what am I gonna do there? Just sit there and watch people? Play games on my phone? Walk around and randomly look at books? Even then, I can't cold approach women. It's nearly impossible for me to even have a basic conversation with one of my friends, let alone a stranger. I've been doing rigorous cognitive behavioral and speech therapy for 6 years now and I'm a lost cause. I just cannot converse with people in the slightest. Nothing comes into my mind at all, it's like my brain completely switches off.

I've also tried dating apps, but in the 5 going on 6 months I've been on tinder and hinge, I haven't gotten a single match, not even a like (besides bots). I even bought hinge+ and tinder whatever and swiped right on every. single. girl. and got absolutely nothing. No matches, at all. And yes, I have pictures with family, friends, doing outdoor activities, playing guitar, and nothing. Not one like or match.

The thing that really irritates me as well, is that I constantly have to witness my friends bringing their girlfriends over, talking to friends who are girls, lighting up the room and making witty and charismatic jokes, while I just sit there in complete silence. And over the past few months, whenever we throw parties, I've even tried talking to some of the women they're friends with, and all I get is one word responses and then they walk off. I try and ask how they're doing, how they know my friends, what they're studying, and it's usually a monotone response to the question and then they walk off.

I mean, I have good hygiene, I make sure my surroundings are clean, I sit up straight and have decent posture and I smile and try and be polite, but I just get nothing. I know that simply being nice to women doesn't mean they have to talk to me, but to this degree is just Earth shattering in my opinion.

Idk, I just need genuine advice on how to even start interacting and meeting women. Because everything I've tried has drastically crashed and burned. I truly believe that I'm going to be alone forever, so I'm considering taking ssri's or hormone blockers as a means of chemical castration. I feel like it's the only way to get some sort of peace of mind at this point.",1,1753002573.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

The mansion was too big, too cold, and too quiet for someone like her. Ada, just eighteen, mopped floors in silence, washed plates that weren’t hers, and slept on a thin mattress beside the kitchen. She wasn’t allowed to sit on the living room couch. She wasn’t allowed to speak unless spoken to. To them, she was invisible—just the help. But every time she stared at the grand chandelier, she dreamed of a life beyond the dust, beyond the dishes, beyond being called “the maid.”She was hired six months ago, after her mother died and her younger siblings were scattered to different relatives. Her only goal was survival. But in this house lived the one man who could change her life forever—Ryan Dike. The billionaire’s only son. Tall. Cold. Handsome. Known for his expensive suits and colder heart. To him, she was just another maid, until the night everything changed.The rain poured heavily that evening. Most of the family had gone out for a charity gala. Ada was cleaning the upstairs hallway when she heard something crash from one of the rooms. Glass. Then silence. She paused. Only she and Ryan were supposed to be in the mansion. She hesitated, then knocked on his door. “Sir? Is everything alright?”No answer.She pushed the door slightly. What she saw made her gasp. Ryan was on the floor, blood staining his white shirt, a shard of glass near his feet. “Sir!” she ran to him. “What happened?” He groaned, gripping his side. “I—left the gala early. Got jumped near the gate. I think it’s a stab wound.” Ada didn’t think twice. She helped him up, her small frame shaking under his weight. She laid him on the bed, ran to the kitchen, grabbed salt, water, and clean cloth. She cleaned his wound with trembling hands. He hissed in pain but never pushed her away.“You’re not like the rest,” he muttered, staring into her eyes. “You actually care.” Ada didn’t answer. She couldn’t. What was she supposed to say? That she’d cared from afar? That his silence hurt more than his insults? That she saw something broken in him, even when he tried to act like a god?From that night, something shifted.He started asking for her—by name. Ada. He stopped yelling. Stopped ignoring her. Started noticing the way she bit her lip when nervous, the way her voice shook when she spoke. She tried to stay away, but how could she? When a man like him started looking at her like she was more than a maid?One evening, he stood by the balcony, watching the sunset. She brought him his coffee. He turned and stared at her. Not her clothes. Not her tray. Her. “You’re different,” he said quietly. “You’re strong. Smart. You’re everything I didn’t know I needed.”She blinked. “Sir—”“Call me Ryan,” he interrupted. “Please.”Her heart raced. This wasn’t part of the job. Falling in love with the boss’s son was a fairytale—one that girls like her weren’t allowed to dream. But Ryan wasn’t giving her a choice. Every glance, every word, every stolen moment—he was drawing her in.And soon, Ada would discover that love with a billionaire wasn’t just dangerous. It was deadly.

I didn’t push, didn’t make a grand move. I just… showed up for her event (with her permission and knowledge of course). Respectfully, quietly. She knew I’d be there — A few hours before her show, she messaged me: “See you soon?” It was casual, but it meant something. I said I’d be there. I ended up running late, but I showed up anyway — quietly, respectfully, just wanting to see her.

After the event, we finally saw each other— first time since our date months ago. And in that moment, we locked eyes. Just for a few seconds — but it felt like a slow exhale after holding my breath for too long. There was something in that gaze. Recognition. Bittersweetness. Like our memories found each other again in silence.

She had only ten minutes of break, and she offered to come with me to the coffee shop. I told her no — it was raining hard, and I didn’t want her to get drenched. So I went instead. I came back soaked, hair dripping, still smelling faintly of the perfume I wore for her. We talked. Laughed a bit. She teased me for still smelling good despite being soaked (bless waterproof perfume, I guess).

We chatted — a little nervous, but warm. I complimented the little things I noticed different about her, how it was nice. 

When her ride came, I insisted on walking her out. Carried her heavy bag, held the umbrella so she wouldn’t get wet, and made sure she got in safely. Just before she got in, I said softly, “Text me when you get home, ok? Stay safe.”

Now, earlier today, I told her I wouldn’t be able to make it to the next event — I had errands to do, and time was tight. But I still wanted to show a little care. So I dropped by the venue just for a moment, handed her the coffee she likes, and left.

She was busy, but she appreciated it. I didn’t stay long. Just passed by, smiled, handed her the drink, and went on my way.

I don’t know what will come next, I don't really expect anything as I'm genuinely doing this out no reason other than... I like her, I care for her and respect her all the way, I'm just expressing that I like her softly without pressure.

All other pods seem to put out the amount specified on the box, plus about half a liter of foam which always ends up on the kitchen floor. But these pods, despite being medium sized, refuse to give us the 230ml it owes us.

He loves me a lot, and everything is fine between us, but there’s one thing that’s been troubling me.

Last year, we were traveling together, and I saw him texting someone. I felt a little weird about it. I noticed he kept texting even when our food arrived. I asked him to eat, but he said, “One minute, I’m messaging.” I got angry and told him to eat first and then text. He started eating but was still texting. It felt off.

He never used to take food pictures, and when I did, he’d say, “The food is getting cold—eat first, don’t take pictures.” But that day, he took pictures after getting ready, which was also unusual.

When I asked him who he was texting, he said, “A friend.” I asked, “What friend?” and he got annoyed. I asked if it was a guy or a girl, and he said I was being weird and walked off mid-meal. I called him back, and he ate, but when I pressed further, he said it was a stranger he met through some random online chat. He didn’t tell me much, didn’t show me the chat, and just tried to comfort me by saying it wasn’t serious.

The next morning, I noticed he was still messaging. I asked what they talked about, and he said things like philosophy and psychology. He told me I’m not mature, so I asked if she was, and he said yes, she was mature, and he’s attracted to intellectual people. That hurt me.

That day, he told me for the first time that our interests aren’t common, and I felt really bad. While I was sad and hurt, he kept chatting with her. When I got a call from home and was talking, he left the room. That had never happened before. I started crying badly and even had a panic attack.

He came back an hour later, saw me crying, and tried to calm me. He said, “What you’re thinking isn’t true—it was just normal online talk.” I told him not to talk to her again, and he agreed. He cried with me too, and we ordered food and went to sleep.

On the train back the next day, he was listening to music with earphones and messaging again. He took videos and sent them to someone. I asked him, “Who are you sending it to?” and he got irritated. I asked him to show me, and he showed the phone quickly. I thought I saw a kiss emoji and asked why he sent that. He said I was being weird and overreacting. Then he blocked her in front of me but didn’t delete her from Telegram. He said it was a habit and it would go away in a few days. He went to the upper seat and put on his earphones, and I sat below thinking, “He must be missing her. He’s hurt.” I wasn’t even thinking about myself.

When he came down later, I asked if he was feeling bad, and he said, “Of course, it doesn’t feel good. I was used to talking to her for 6 months.” That made me feel even worse.

He said they had been talking for 6 months. Our relationship even came close to a breakup that day, but we cried and decided to stay together. I tried to forget it all, but I was still deeply hurt.

When I later brought it up again, we argued. I asked to see the chats, but he said, “If you want to see the chats, it means you don’t trust me.” I said, “I do trust you, but I need to understand what happened.”

I asked him again to show me just the chats from the two days we were together. He said, “I’ll show you, but after that, I don’t want to be in this relationship.” I was shocked—he was blaming me for not trusting him, even though he was the one hiding things.

Eventually, he sent me a screen recording of those two days. In those chats, I saw them talking like boyfriend and girlfriend—“Where are you?” “Did you eat?” “What did you eat?” He updated her about everything: packing, train timing, even what he had for lunch or dinner. He was giving her the kind of updates he usually gave me.

He told me he would stop talking to her, but clearly, he initiated messages, shared pictures, shared care—like “go for a walk,” “take care.” It was too much to be “just talking.”

He once made a list of things she liked: chocolate chips, lipsticks, coffee, fruits, sunflower, and more. Who makes such a list for a “stranger”? He once complimented her nails and sent her a picture of his hand. He told me he didn’t even know if she was a guy or a girl, but that clearly wasn’t true.

Even though I only saw two days of chat, it was enough. He claimed it was “time pass,” but I knew there was more.

Later, he admitted he talked to two more girls—one on WhatsApp, two on Twitter. I even got screenshots from one of the girls, which confirmed that there was flirting, not just casual conversation. He sent her more than just “good morning.”

Still, I tried to move on.

One day, I created a fake account and messaged him to see what he’d say. He accepted and started talking. He even planned to watch a movie together (with her—me in disguise), but told me he was studying. I was hurt again. I watched him talking for hours with “her,” thinking it was just chatting, but it was more than that.

Then one day, while checking a picture in his phone, I found a drawing: her name + infinity + his name + a date. When I asked, he said it was just from when they used to talk—it meant nothing. But it broke me again.

He told me, “This is who I am—I like talking to girls. If you want to stay, stay. If not, leave. I know it’s bad, but I’ll change.”

I asked him: Is this what love is? If your partner is busy for a few days, do you look for someone else? During my sister’s wedding, when I was busy, he looked for “an alternative.” I never did that, even when he was busy with his internship or roommates. I always messaged.

He didn’t even feel guilty. He says it was my fault, my choice. But now that the wedding is over and I’m back, he’s still talking to girls. What’s the excuse now?

He says he loves me, but hides things, talks to girls, flirts. He says it's “just time pass,” not cheating—but is that love? Is that loyalty?

Even after all this, I still love him, I still trust him—but I don’t know what he really wants. He never fully opened up, never clearly explained anything. I don’t know what to do. I’m confused. Is this cheating or not?",1,1753001742.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

TWENTY. FIVE. PERCENT.

For a salad I ordered myself. Picked up myself. No table service. No refill. No “how’s everything tasting?” Literally just… they put the box on a shelf and I grabbed it.

And yet I still tipped 20% because I felt too awkward not to.

Like… why?? Why do I feel guilty for not giving extra money to a company that already charges $17 for lettuce?

It’s not even about being cheap. I want people to be paid well. But why am I the one patching the holes in this broken system? Why is it my job to make sure someone’s getting paid properly? That’s your boss’s job. That’s payroll. That’s the f\*\*king business model, not me.

It’s all backwards. And manipulative.

It’s like emotional blackmail with a smiley face.

“Oh, just a little something to show your appreciation?”

NO. I just want my damn salad and to go home without feeling like a bad person.

And don’t come at me with the “If you can’t afford to tip, don’t go out” BS. No. If YOU can’t afford to pay your workers, you shouldn’t be running a business.

And it’s everywhere now. Coffee shops, takeout, self-checkout kiosks. What am I tipping? The robot?

It’s not about gratitude anymore. It’s pressure. It’s performative. It’s this weird social game we all silently agree to play because no one wants to look like an asshole.

But I’m so tired, man.

I want to pay for my food, say thank you, and not feel like a moral failure for hitting “no tip” when I didn’t even speak to a single human being.

We need to kill tipping culture. Just pay people a living f\*\*king wage. Add it to the prices. Be honest about what things cost. I’d rather pay $19 for a salad than $17 + an awkward tip dance + a side of guilt.

As stated in the title. I have about 6 year old PC with i5-9600K and I was able to get the ""best"" (not counting KS :D) Intel CPU of that time on the 1151 Coffee Lake - used i9-9900K; MoBo Z390.

[https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z390%20Extreme4/index.asp#CPU](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z390%20Extreme4/index.asp#CPU)

I have bios 2.3 and I need the 4.00. I flashed bios in the past succesfully, I think I can do that again successfully.  
I would like to ask for some tips, because of course the i5-9600K is OC'ed and it has a custom profile. I would like to keepo this profile if anything goes wrong and I will have to go back to this cpu if my mission of replacing the CPU fails.  
I was thinking about correct proccedure  
1) Flashing bios with old CPU  
2) Applying default profile / reset the bios settings to default (I'm afraid it will change also different settings related to RAM, Discs etc.)  
3) Removing i5 CPU and change CPU for the i9  
4) New OC values

With the i5 I did not do the OC so thats why I dont know what was changed and where. I paid a guy who put PC together from parts and he also did OC and stress testing of the PC.

Should I export the current BIOS and current OC profile to some USB flash disc or into a PC? Will the MoBO reset to default anyway if it detects different CPU?

Thanks.

I put together a simple birthday reminder app that doesn’t just track when someone’s birthday is (duh), but also builds a profile of the person you add. Call it personality or psychometric profiling, whatever you feel.

Spent about two/three weeks, with a  couple of hours each day (not sure it is justified), but I do think the idea’s decent (change my mind), and it doesn’t look half bad. I’m not a designer, though, so any feedback design wise is welcome as well

(P.S. I’ll keep it in mind for my next projects and change in current app =)) )

All the core birthday tracking stuff is completely free (widgets, reminders and core useful logic basically). If you want to see all the profile stats, there’s a one-time unlock, basically the price of a coffee. Pretty fair, right?

Aaand there’s a funny(-ish) bit about the launch:

The AppStoreConnect folks didn’t want to approve it at first because it had horoscopes in there. So I just took out any mention of them, and the app sailed through, with no changes to the actual profiling logic. A minor life hack, maybe?

I will share this embarrasing story here in the hopes that other tourists don't fall for it, because if I were able to find a story like this while doing research I wouldn't have been scammed. We all felt so incredibly stupid when we found out we were being played by an experienced manipulator. Here is what happened.

A friend of ours recommended to message this man called Sugiyarto who works for the kitchen of the Royal Palace (Kraton), he would show us around there. Because this friend told us she had a good time with ""Sugi"" we had our guard down, even though we were already aware of a so called ""batik gallery scam"". On the streets in Yogya you oftend get approached by people claiming this beautiful batik gallery is only open for one more day, so you have to go see it. Even the Royal Guards knew Sugi by name, which looking back they probably knew what he was doing and were laughing at us. Sugi seemed really friendly and interested.

Sugiyarto claimed to have been a chef in the kitchen of the Kraton and showed us pictures to back it up. He also told us about his family who he said worked for the Sultan, and showed videos of his ""son"" practicing ceremonial dancing in the Kraton yard. 

In short, this man showed us around the area surrounding Kraton, and took us to see different cultural shops. He claimed all these neighborhoods surrounding the walls were actually part of the Kraton employee housing. First he showed us a Batik Gallery where handmade paintings were made. The paintings were beautiful and we bought one for 400k IDR, which a Google search and a ChatGPT prompt said was actually below normal asking price so I trusted it was alright. In hindsight it was easy to see this was sketchy. Then he took us to a ""Lawuk coffee shop"" where he likes to drink coffee alledgedly, because it is low in caffeine. I again checked the normal prices online and concluded that 90k IDR is normal for this coffee, so we decided to try it reluctantly. When drinking the presumably fake Lawuk coffee I did some more research, and between all the other tourists 5 star reviews of this place I found a review of someone who had been coerced by Sugiyarto to come here too! This was the moment we knew we were being played. This ""low caffeine"" coffee had me jittering after half a cup.

Now knowing that he was just taking us to his friends stores to make commision we asked him to take us to this supposed kitchen where he used to work before retiring. This kitchen was just a grubby kitchen outside of the Kraton walls where they wanted to show us how to make wayang puppets.

Then we said we wanted him to tell us more about the Kraton, but he didn't want to go back inside the walls.

After this we approached an official guide of the Kraton who was wearing the real uniform, asked him for confirmation that this was indeed a scammer. He told us this man never worked for the Sultan's kitchen and that we paid 4 times too much for the batik painting. But he did confirm it was real and handmade. We felt embarrased but ultimately we were able to laugh about it. And by the way this friend never found out she was scammed.

So to any tourists reading this, never let your guard down in Yogyakarta when it comes to stuff like this, even when other tourists have recommended something and even when people, like the Royal Guards, who should be trustworthy seem to approve. Sorry if this post is a bit messy, the caffeine from the fake catpoop coffee still has me feeling jittery.


TLDR;

An ""ex-chef"" for the Sultan, recommended to us by a friend, scammed us with batik art and expensive poop kopi.

ANTG Junor Balanced Flower
""Australian Natural Juno Cannabis""
Cultivar: Libras
Sativa/indica hybrid, indica dominant
11.5% THC and 12.5% CBD 

Consumed through a mighty vape and bong. I do not use tobacco.

Extremely dense nuggets of bush, does not appear to have been grown under lights, which is unusual for a medically dispensed product. 

Smell: chocolate/coffee earthy skunky notes and a hint of fruit. 

I cant provide terpene content as the product is now discontinued, but I remember reading it being mostly myrcene (apparently, who knows if its actually tested) 

This brands products seem to all be fairly overpriced. This one was $13/g which was cheaper than all their other products prescribed to me... dont worry ill soon be changing providers. 

SUMMARY: 

Hybrid bud like this gives me the slow and stupid reactions/thoughts of an indica combined with the anxiety and shakiness that some people report from sativa.
Not recommended for lower tolerance users. 

My first experience with this product, I vaped half what I usually would. 

It came on slower than I was expecting, at first I was fine, then slowly became extremely anxious, cold and shaking, with massively elevated heartbeat. My thought process was extremely muddled and I found myself forgetful and unable to focus. I found myself craving a hot shower as it was the only thing to provide relief from cold and shaking (classic hyperemesis symptom). I did not green out or even get close. 

Despite being stronger than im used to, it didnt do much to help with my pain, maybe after an hour but not immediately. 

I decided to slowly increase my tolerance to try again later. I mixed a very small amount of it with my usual buds. It makes the mix notibly stronger, in a way thats easy to become overly stoned. When that happens I again experience extreme anxiety and extreme cold with elevated heart rate. The only good thing about it for me is that it does increase my appetite after about an hour. 

This could be due to my low tolerance but I suspect also its just how I react to the strain, as it still affects me like that in a dose dependant way. My other weed doesnt make me feel that way no matter how much I use. 

I notice I generally react badly to hybrids in the same way, which is why I bought this balanced one, as I wasnt sure if the side effects were just from unbalanced THC/CBD etc. 

I cant help but wonder if this product is grown with PGR, as its incredibly dense for just bush. This could explain my bad reactions to it also because in the past ive experienced hyperemesis symptoms, that disappeared after quitting then smoking home grown bud instead 

I personally do not like this product at all, and judging by the fact its now discontinued I doubt I was alone in that. But bear in mind this could be due to low tolerance. I quit completely for a few years and my tolerance reset, except for reasons unknown to me I am actually much more sensitive to THC now than I was even when I first started smoking at 15.

* Clean design focused on showcasing your products
* Built-in product catalog and cart (no Shopify or Wix bloat)
* Fully responsive (mobile-first)
* Multi-language ready (currently set up in English and German)
* Easily adaptable to local payment and shipping providers

FUCK THAT BITCH, FUCK CLOSURE, FUCK A CONVO

They know exactly what they're doing to you by not allowing you the peace of mind you deserve. They don't owe you shit. they don't answer to you anymore. the silence that eats you up is strategic, methodical, to break you down and turn you into the little bitch they knew you would turn into. becoming a trophy to show off to their friends on how shittie of a person you turned out to be. fuck that.

You fucked up your marriage? GOOD! You fumbled the most amazing woman in your life? GOOD! That bitch ghosted? GOOD! walked away, left without a word, no explanation, got you all mind fucked trying to figure out what the fuck just happened. GOOD? Now you’re over there crying like a little bitch for this fucking cunt that leaves you on read, doesn’t answer your calls anymore, got us over here asking, pleading, begging, apologizing for shit we didn’t even do, fuck it, it's all my fault, I take full responsibility. But of course, that’s after they break up with us and we’re feeling like this shit bags that we are because we got complacent, we got too comfortable. It felt good didnt it? the love was good, the pussy was the best you ever had, that head game was like whoa. now?

She doesn’t give a fuck about you no more, she’s got a dick in her mouth right now, getting railed by who fucking knows how many dudes since that bitch left your sorry ass. She left you before she even walked out of the building. She was already checked out. And you know what? She had every reason to leave. She was fed up, tired of the same old bullshit, promises you made just to get her to shut the fuck up, when all she ever asked for was for you to be there when it mattered, to be present, honest, take ownership, be mature, have courage, be the man that you were meant to be for her, for yourself, for y’all and grow as a unit. And now that motherfucker is all over this bitch on Reddit, talking shit about what a fucking scumbag you are, a manipulating motherfucker just to have control, gaslighting, shifting the blame over to her so that you can be the victim and her the villain. The endless lies that we tell. That we are opportunistic. They call us conniving and that we’re calculated. How they're surprised that they know somebody with an extremely low IQ who couldn’t even change a lightbulb. But let’s not forget they can’t even change a fucking tire at five in the morning on top of a bridge going northbound, lol, so they call who? Papi, duh.

What’s that word, that’s used loosely around here? Oh yeah, NARCISSIST. That’s what we are now. That is how we are labeled. That is now how we are identified. I like it. why? because I know I'm not, but since she insists, I got a trick for that ass. be the NARC they call you. find her weak spot, work quietly, plant the seed, play their game. they think we are dumb anyways, prove it to them, fulfill their wet fantasy of being superior and hit em where it hurst them the most, walk away, watch it burn from a distance and enjoy the satisfaction of fucking her over one last time because that's what we're good at.

As they sit on their thrones, high, and mighty typing away on their phone or keyboard, looking down on us, degrading us, dragging us through the mud with their one-sided story, their version of how they are perfect and we’re not. It’s the same shit over and over. I have yet to read a slimy ass post where it’s explained that not only was my “narcissistic” ex wrong for what he did, but I too made some mistakes along the way. When they talk about us, they go all in, they go balls deep just like we did down their throats. I don’t remember being called a narc then. It was, “yes daddy, I'm your good girl daddy"".

Gents, females think critically. They think ahead. They know exactly what they’re doing, they know what we’re thinking, they’re already steps ahead of us in planning. They have it all figured out. We, men, don’t give a fuck like that. we would like to, buuut some of us idiots think that telling them every day we love them is enough. It’s not! It’s more than that. Love is respect, and showing up as a partner, not an individual to ensure that the relationship keeps growing. But some of us were too dumb to realize that. And you know who does and has it all figured out? Bitches. sometimes we learn the hard way and are taught a valuable lesson. She wasn’t asking for anything complicated, she wasn’t asking for you to perform a miracle, she was only asking for us to be the men they deserve. Some of these bitches don’t deserve shit. Some of these females act like they’re nasty coffee breath don’t stink.

Oh, your boys a scumbag? Why is he a scumbag? Sure, some dudes are straight up assholes. But some dudes aren’t what they are describing us to be as they play the victim, but please go on and tell everybody that we created a narrative, we create fake history so that you are the villain in our story. What about you, Miss high and mighty? What was it about your stupid ass face that made your boy act the way that he did? Why did he become the person that you can no longer stand to know that he continues to exist, when you loved him with everything you had? If you’re gonna talk shit tell the truth because you’re stank pussy ass is not perfect and you know damn well, you have some blame in it too. And you know what, at the end of the day, all this shit that they write on here about us as if they are speaking to us, they don’t have the balls to say it to our faces. You know why? Because they're fucking pussies.

Tell me I’m lying, when they’re in front of you and y’all are talking about y’all’s relationship, gazing into each other's eyes, and you’re over there trying to wiggle in a shitty question that you already know the answer to, “so we’re never getting back together?” While that bitch is in tears, crying, won’t answer questions, deflecting, not admitting to anything, because all you really wanted was the same simple thing that bitch was asking for too, an answer. But as soon as they walk away, they become the infamous keyboard warriors that they are, Internet gangsters as I like to call em. PUSSIES BRO!

Not one bitch on here has proved to any of us what they write on here and what they actually tell their partner. Do you know why? Because if they do they will reveal themselves. They worked so hard to cover every single angle and they cannot afford to show us who’s truly behind that mask. That would mean having to hold themselves accountable for their actions. I learned the hard way. Let me tell you, I didn’t half ass it, I fucked it all of the way up. I'm still madly in love with her but fuck that bitch too. I know what's up. but I have never been naïve to the fact of pretending to think that she still thinks of me romantically. Some of these hoes lied to themselves by thinking that the same way they accused us of making shit up.

PUUUSSSSIIIIIEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. STOP FRONTIN!

What’s that? If I’m right, prove me wrong if I’m wrong i’ll admit I was wrong and I apologize. The jokes on us, men? The jokes on y'all for coming on here and taking sides for a bitch that isn’t giving us the whole truth, only her truth, and we are not gonna sit back and let you get away with it, it’s time that ALL of us start calling out the bullshit. we, are, according to them...

vindictive + conniving = vengeance       HAHA

Everything continues, yes. The clocks tick. The sun rises. The birds sing. But none of it feels quite real, quite right, quite... mine without you.

You are the pulse behind my calm. The reason every sunrise holds meaning. You’ve made a home inside my heart, one I didn’t know existed until you walked in with that quiet grace, those eyes that saw through me like pages of a worn-out book, and hands that healed parts of me I’d forgotten were wounded.

Life feels strange these days, Sweetheart. Like I’m living someone else’s script. I smile when I must, I speak when I should, but deep down there’s this hush in my spirit—like it’s waiting for the soft rustle of your hair against my chest, the warmth of your head resting where my heartbeat races.

I’ve never known love like this. Not the kind you read in books, but the kind that changes the air you breathe. The kind that makes you softer, stronger, braver, all at once. The kind that makes you want to become the best version of yourself just to be worthy of the gaze of the woman who already thinks you’re enough.

I catch myself doing little things the way you would. Talking to plants because you said they deserve kindness. Folding my blanket with that neatness you like. Humming songs you once sang under your breath. You see, you've seeped into everything. Not like an echo, but like a presence. A constant.

I don’t want a world that doesn’t have your footsteps in it, your laugh echoing in it, your hands writing softness into my chaos. I want the small things with you, Sweetheart. The quiet mornings. The coffee that turns cold because we’re too busy talking. The shared silences. The eye contact that says everything.

I want to hold your hand through every storm and every sunbeam. I want to wake up to your sleepy eyes, whisper your name into the space between dreams and daylight, and know that I’ve made it—I’ve found home.

You don’t complete me, my love. You elevate me. You show me what love looks like when it’s patient, kind, and laced with fire. You are the poetry the stars tried to write but failed, because they didn’t have you.

My heart doesn't just beat for you. It lives for you.

And until you're near me again, I'll keep holding onto every memory we’ve made like a sacred promise of all the days we’re yet to live—together.",8,1752999286.0,LettersAnswered,1,1.0,False

Thinking it nothing more than a spill i place a towel down over the offending patch and step over it into the kitchen to make another coffee.

Yet as my unfortunate sock steps down onto the laminate floor of our kitchen, it finds yet another puddle, and through my disgust, i once again presume it mothing more than a rather extensive spill from my beloved, and make a note to call him and ask what he had done to make such a mess before leaving our shared abode earlier in the day.

As I  had expected, my call goes unanswered,  my partner opting not to keep his phone in him during his weekly Squash meet, and I'm left in my damp confusion. Coffee obtained, i step past the puddle in the kitchen (which i had so gracefully slid the earlier towel over in a feeble attempt to stave back The Wetness) and Attempt to make my way over the initial damp spot in the carpet, only to realise with dawning horror(and another damp sock) that it had only grown. 

It's at this point that i realise that I'm dealing with no mere spill, and also at this moment i realise thay i can hear something - a faint drip, drip, dripping coming from the wall beside me.  I think I'm hearing things. The wall's perfectly dry, it's in the middle of the house, it can't be wet, and yet- i press my ear to the deceptive plaster and hear it loud and clear: the sound of a leak.

My partner calls me back and i tell him to come home, realising again all too suddenly the dampness in our carpet is still spreading, the wet puddle in the middle of what we thought was our impenetrable home now having grown to encompass the entire opening of our kitchen,  as well as claiming more than a few feet of carpet. 

One emergency call to our property manager later, a plumber shows up, looks at the floor, climbs in the roof and tells us a rat got into our roof cavity and chewed through one of the pipes, and waters just been,,,, seeping down the inside of our walls in the middle of the house.  Now we don't have water until it's fixed, which won't be until at least tomorrow as by now it's past business hours lmao.

Sorry for the long and potentially off-topic post, i know it's not strictly distractible related but I'm,,,,,, incredibly tired at this point and thought this community would get a kick out of my misery lol.",2,1752999242.0,distractible,2,0.75,False
