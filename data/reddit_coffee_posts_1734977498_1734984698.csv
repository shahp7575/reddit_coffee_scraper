Any local you ask about Oso is going to say the coffee is amazing, and it couldn't be any farther from the truth. Their beans are just burned into bitterness misery. Even if you order a coffee + milk drink they almost certainly are going to burn the milk too, especially if it's a plant-based option.

Yes they might have good food options, and yes, they might have a very pleasant external area for hanging out, and yes, they are local, but can we please not pretend their coffee is anything worth drinking? And no, this is not a matter of taste, nobody likes burned food, so why would anyone ever like burned drinks?

Empire for example serves good coffee and food, the environment is nice, and we have a whole town full of amazing hangout spots. If you want to get really amazing world class coffee No. 6 is just 5 blocks away. Dominion is absolutely solid. They're all options just as local as Oso.

When I proposed my coworker we could replace or add another provider for the office they were exasperated. What's with this craziness???

1hkw17x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hkw17x/laughland_teeth_whitening_does_it_really_deliver/,Laughland Teeth Whitening: Does It Really Deliver?,"Teeth whitening is something many of us consider, especially if coffee, tea, or wine has taken a toll on our smiles. But finding a product that actually works without leaving your teeth sore or gums irritated can be a challenge. I‚Äôve tried several methods over the years, from whitening strips to professional treatments, and recently decided to try **Laughland Teeth Whitening**. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at my experience, what sets it apart, and why it‚Äôs worth considering.

# What Is Laughland Teeth Whitening?

Laughland is an at-home teeth whitening kit that aims to deliver professional-level results without the steep cost or hassle of visiting a dentist. It includes a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** and an LED mouthpiece, which together target stains and discoloration on your teeth.

The kit is designed to tackle both surface stains (caused by things like coffee and wine) and deeper discoloration (from aging or genetics). What caught my attention was the claim that you could see results in as little as six days‚Äîwith minimal sensitivity.

# My Experience with Laughland Teeth Whitening

I was a little skeptical at first. I‚Äôve tried whitening strips before, and while they did lighten my teeth a little, they often left me with sharp sensitivity that made eating and drinking uncomfortable. With Laughland, the process was surprisingly simple and gentle:

1. **Day 1**: I followed the instructions, brushing and drying my teeth before applying the whitening gel. The LED mouthpiece fit comfortably and only took 10 minutes to use. I didn‚Äôt notice any immediate changes but appreciated how easy it was to incorporate into my routine.
2. **Day 3**: By the third session, I started noticing subtle improvements. My teeth looked a bit brighter, especially the ones near the front.
3. **Day 6**: After six days, my teeth were noticeably whiter‚Äîaround 6‚Äì7 shades lighter. The results looked natural, not overly ‚ÄúHollywood white,‚Äù which I appreciated.

The best part? I experienced **no sensitivity** throughout the process, which was a first for me.

# How Does Laughland Compare to Other Whitening Products?

Over the years, I‚Äôve tried a mix of whitening methods, and here‚Äôs how Laughland stacks up:

* **Whitening Strips**: These are convenient but often uneven in their results, as they don‚Äôt cover all parts of your teeth. They also tend to cause sensitivity if used too often.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: These are great for maintaining a white smile but don‚Äôt deliver dramatic results on their own.
* **Professional Treatments**: While effective, they‚Äôre expensive and can cause significant sensitivity.

Laughland feels like the best of both worlds: affordable and effective, with the added bonus of being **gentle on sensitive teeth**.

# What Makes Laughland Unique?

Several features set Laughland apart from other at-home kits:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The whitening gel is designed to deliver professional results without the harsh side effects.
2. **Temperature-Controlled Storage**: The gel is stored in controlled conditions, ensuring it arrives at your door potent and effective.
3. **LED Mouthpiece**: This technology helps activate the whitening ingredients, speeding up the process and ensuring more even results.

# Are There Any Downsides?

While I was impressed with Laughland, there are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Commitment**: You need to use it daily for six days to see the full results. While the sessions only take 10 minutes, it does require consistency.
* **Cost**: It‚Äôs more expensive than drugstore strips, but given the results and lack of sensitivity, I think it‚Äôs worth it.

# Who Is Laughland Best For?

If you‚Äôve struggled with sensitivity from other whitening products or are looking for a more affordable alternative to professional treatments, Laughland is a great option. It‚Äôs also ideal for anyone who wants noticeable results without spending weeks or months on a whitening routine.

# Final Thoughts on Laughland Teeth Whitening

Laughland Teeth Whitening surprised me in all the right ways. It‚Äôs easy to use, delivers noticeable results, and is gentle enough for sensitive teeth. While it does require a small time commitment, the results are well worth it. If you‚Äôre considering whitening your teeth, I‚Äôd highly recommend giving Laughland a try.

I know that the important thing is that I feel comfortable, but I always appreciate the opinions of others, maybe you find an opportunity for improvement that I'm not seeing.

This is a new version of the categories I used during this year, less specific but more efficient (at least that's what I want to believe). For example, I reduced some categories by grouping (subscriptions, supplements). I analyzed my 2024 expenses and added/removed categories accordingly.

I want a future with ‚Äúfewer surprises‚Äù and one where I can better control my personal finances, and in some ways, I feel that these categories do just that... The names of the category groups are not yet 100% defined.

**Quality of life** are expenses that are very much about taking care of my mind, body and soul. Each one of these makes me happy

**Business** is my ""temporary"" group of categories. For the first few months of the year, it will be in my budget until both projects grow or be launched

\---

**Questions you may have**

* *Why don't you put groceries, coffee and water together? It works for me to have coffee and water separately, as the expense can be ""high"", and I like to know how much I specifically spend on them*
* *You used to have individual categories for subscriptions and supplements, how do you know how many you spend on each now? If needed, I have that information in the Payee and Memo fields in my account*
* *Therapy, running club membership (inside running) and GYM shouldn't be on Bills? Even though they are fixed expenses, I feel they serve another purpose. By having them in different groups, depending on the purpose, I feel Reflect gives me more valuable information. In case of an emergency, the Bills will still be paid, Quality of life can be reduced or paused*

1hkvzvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1hkvzvk/trip_report_the_luxury_collection_midtown/,TRIP REPORT: The Luxury Collection Midtown Manhattan ,"Stayed 2 nights, weekend just before Xmas

150k Bonvoy points for base 1-bedroom suite + $1,400 cash for upgrade to corner Sky Suite on top floor (54th).

Was really dreading this stay because the reviews have been terrifying for years. Property was recently reflagged to Luxury Collection (Marriott Bonvoy) after several years managed by Hilton Conrad -- and Hotel London before that.

BUT we wanted to spend some time with family traveling to the city for the holidays and wanted to stay in midtown. And I hate hate hate spending lots of money in NYC, especially in midtown. I think NYC offers some of the worst value hotel experiences of any city on planet earth.

Everything is aggressively expensive, service is generally crap (with some exceptions), and most properties have been beat to hell from huge volume turnover (rivaled only by Vegas in this respect).

I thought Luxury Collection was a decent use of my points. I could get a lot of space for not a ton of money. I mean compare with basically any other luxury property in midtown, suites this time of year are going for $3,000-$5,000 a night.

**Summary verdict:**

I'm not sure why the reviews are quite so bad. We had a fine stay. But it was only fine. Nothing great. Nothing horrible. Pretty mid, all things considered.

If you want extra space at a comparatively accessible price point, this is a good value play. But you're not gonna get real luxury by any stretch. We stayed at The Edition New York in Flatiron last month and it was infinitely better.

Personally, we won't be back. But honestly shoot me if I stay in midtown ever again for any reason.

**The suite:**

Unrefined, unremarkable. Plenty of space, though. And some spectacular views. 54th floor, looking south. Could see the Freedom Tower and The Edge.

Beyond that, the room was pretty meh. Just felt old and a little beat up.

Also most of the snacks in the mini bar had been opened and eaten. When I pointed it out to housekeeping, she said oh yeah it happens all the time because I guess the snacks sit on a thing that triggers a charge when the weight is removed. So people just open the box and eat the snacks without removing the box, thus avoiding the charge. But, like, if it happens all the time, you'd think it would be part of the housekeeping process to double check the mini bar?? So, that felt a little motel cheap, honestly.

And I think that sorta sums up this property: Zero attention to detail.

On a better note, rainfall shower had awesome water pressure. Felt like I was standing in a car wash--in a good way. So that was a perk.

**Service:**

Everyone I interacted with were pretty sweet and on the ball. Bellpersons were fast to help. Valet team good, although it took 40 minutes (!) to get our car at checkout.

Another weird thing : **Hotel operator never answered the phone on the first try.** We ordered room service a couple times, needed extra towels once. No matter the request, the phone would just ring and ring and ring. Super annoying. Always had to hang up and try again. Don't understand the problem there.

Housekeeping did turndown, but I legit think all they did was leave a couple chocolates on the nightstand. Otherwise there was basically no evidence they'd been there.

On a better note, in-room dining made my kid mac n cheese despite it not being on the kids menu. I always appreciate when folks go a little extra to meet a guest request. 

**Dining:**

The on-site restaurant is called Dabble. They're open all day.

Elite perks here are pretty good. They give you $50 per day for breakfast + $35 dining credit, which is paid as a resort fee. $25 per head for a decent enough buffet. They also have a la carte options.

I saw some reviews really complaining about the breakfast, but we thought it was not bad at all. Especially for $25 per person in midtown. Our 3 year old loved it. Also the complimentary coffee in the lobby was excellent.

I've talked to some of you, I've voiced my opinion, I've put in time into helping some of y'all or at least point y'all in the right direction, I'm gonna do my best at keeping this post clean so that it stays up and possibly reach someone who may or may not find it useful.
I'm not here to debate or have an endlessly back and forward on what works what doesn't.

I WAS A SEVERE CASE. I wasted 30 pounds of muscle. I used to walk around 200 pounds before this and I got down to 160 while at my worst, prepping for an endoscopy and colonoscopy. I had the facial changes, dark circles under my eyes, weak jawline, sexual dysfunction, SEVERE INSOMNIA, muscle fasciculations 24/7 while I saw myself waste away in the mirror every F day ....

So for those of you that believe this syndrome is irreversible or PERMANENT, this post is not for you.
You lost the battle, if you even gave it one.
Just like the world out there PFS is not for the weak, there's WARRIORS/WOLVES and there's VICTIMS/PREY there's no room for anything in between. And a lot of you allowed yourselves to fully take on the victim identity.

That being said, I told you the main focus of this post was gonna be RECOVERY, PROACTIVE RECOVERY, those of you that have AND WILL TAKE ACTION.

And before you think I'm about to share here some secrets or some new developments, I'm not. I implemented EVERYTHING that's been known to help or has aided others in recovery.
So first let me shout out those that have shared their knowledge to help this community: Alex Kikel, Hans Amato, all the bowtied guys on twitter, the bio hacking community in general and also the Ray Peat forum.

So without beating too much around the bush here's the things ive used and implemented into my protocol, I DID NOT USE all these things at once, I rotated and cycled a lot of these for prolonged periods of time, nothing works over night CONSISTENCY is key.
So first things first
GUT, GUT, GUT
Antimicrobials, we got candida, h pylori, Sibo all these bacteria go out of balance wrecking your whole digestive GUT/BRAIN AXIS. (Vagus nerve) Therefore leaking toxins into the intestinal membrane and later ending up in your blood stream. I had elevated Hematocrit, RBCs and bilirubin that was one of the few things the mainstream medical establishment was able to show me on paper. I went to gastros, endos, oncology, you name it ...
They did not help. That was MY EXPERIENCE. 
If you got a doctor that's aware of PFS and is willing to prescribe any therapy great for you, that wasn't me.

I went on my own ... I was already unable to sleep for F months.. so I stayed up reading papers and conducting my own research on male hormones, gut health, Neuro steroid cascades all of it. I had to leave my job, cash out my 401k and try to SURVIVE.
Just so you know, it wasn't cheap, I spent thousands in desperation, a lot of you are SCARED to ""CRASH"" , I WAS SCARED OF LIVING WITH THIS GODDAMN SYNDROME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

so ... You gonna have to cleanse/nuke your gut bacteria and then repopulate. While also attempting to turn on your hormone production. pretty much the same approach of what's known now as BAT( Bipolar androgen therapy)

So for the gut...
 Needless to say Watch out for 5ARI like ginger and green tea amongst others.

Activated charcoal
Clean sourced baking soda
Niacinamide 
Lemon water
Dandelion root tea
Camphor
Carrot salad
Oil of oregano ( easy with it)
There's many more do your own research.
Now ... HDACI
Berberine 
Butyrate 
Valpro ( I did not touch it)
Resveratrol (easy on the dosing)

PEPTIDES
 I used a few...
LIVAGEN
EPITALON 
BPC 157 TB 500 GHK CU (Glow protocol) 
DSIP
OXYTOCIN nasal Spray 
If you're obese throw in there a GLP agonist id go Retatrutide ...

REMOVE POISON
processed foods. PARABENS. FLUORIDE. HERBICIDES, watch for ingredients on your body wash, deodorant toothpaste ... A lot of you never heal because of this. 
CLEAN DIET ORGANIC, FRUIT, MEAT, RAW MILK RAW CHEESE, RAW HONEY. I don't eat a lot of veggies but that's me, im not here to debate diet. Eat what you want as long as it's not processed poison.

LIGHT ENVIRONMENT/MITOCHONDRIAL HEALTH
refer to Dr Jack Kruse
FULL SPECTRUM UVB LIGHT 
SUN EXPOSURE RED LIGHT THERAPY 
BLUE LIGHT BLOCKERS 
NO LEDS
CORRECT CIRCADIAN RHYTHM. 
SUN GAZING....
Methylene blue between 5 or 10mg eod.

ANDROGENS
well here it depends on your own personal experience 
Some of you were bodybuilders before this so y'all got more experience with certain compounds
I stayed away from harsher ones like DHB and others,
If you want my opinion, I'd go DHT and Test transdermals to help reactivate androgen receptors on skin.
But if you wanna go injectable Test and primo that's a good combo gaining a lot of traction these days...
Also proviron etc ... 
Mainly any DHT derivative while using an HDACI, while taking care of gut health.

HGC low dose 250 to 500iu eod. Y'all know the deal. Stay on it long term don't expect much from only couple weeks get yourself at least 5 to 10 vials.

HONORABLE MENTIONS, SOME OF THESE HELPED ME A LOT

INJECTABLE L CARNITINE. AVOID ORAL. oral is a MAOI, you can use garlic with it, but I said f that. I rather inject it. START LOW AND WORK YOUR WAY UP I started as low as 200mg it depends on your bodyweight don't start at 600mg. It's an awesome pre workout now that I'm building muscle again I use it eod

GLYCINE FOR SLEEP WITH CHAMOMILE 
TAURINE WITH COFFEE. COFFEE ITSELF WILL HELP YOU. CLEAN SOURCED NO STARBUCKS OR ANY OF THAT BS. TAURINE START LOW YOU CAN GO UP TO 2 GRAMS.

CREATINE ... 5 grams min, you can go up to 20 if your stomach tolerates it well. Start slow

SAFFRON look into BDNF

TADALAFIL low dose. 2.5 to 5 mg eod ... Use it to workout not to watch porn and whack off like a loser.

That takes me into the next one... SEMEN RETENTION. idk ... Believe what you want to believe. If you have a partner and are able to have sex or at least try then go for it... If not stop masturbating and focus on healing.

Idk guys ... I might be forgetting a lot of things but that's a good template you build on it.

Like I SAID, I'm thankful for PFS, IT MADE ME A BETTER MAN, I WENT THROUGH HELL AND BACK BUT I WILL BE MORE DETERMINED AND STRONGER THAN EVER. LIFE IS AMAZING DONT EVER TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

BEST OF LUCK TO ALL OF YOU. JUST REMEMBER NOBODY WILL COME AND SAVE YOU. YOU GOT TO SAVE YOURSELF. 

MERRY CHRISTMAS AND BLESSINGS TO ALL OF YOU. I'll stay around to help, and answer some of y'all questions, but not for too long... I'm going to enjoy and rebuild my life. 

Peace ‚úåÔ∏è üïäÔ∏è

1hkvwfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hkvwfi/spoiled_surprise_christmas_present/,Spoiled Surprise Christmas Present,"Hey everyone! 

Literally my first time posting something like this ever, so bear with me. 

TL:DR I think I spoiled a really serious gift that my (M 24) partner‚Äôs (M 25) family got me. I don‚Äôt know for sure, but there‚Äôs a good chance. What do I do?

So, I wake up this morning and go to the kitchen to make coffee and start the day. For background, I live in an old townhouse community with a parking lot for all of the residents, i.e. many units directly connected but with separate entrances from the outside. I look out my kitchen window and see, directly parked right by the entrance to our house, a black Jeep with a green bow on the dashboard. My first thought immediately is woah whoever got that is very lucky because that would be awesome! I took a picture and sent it to my partner and said something to that effect and joking asked if he bought me a car, and I got an ‚Äúlol‚Äù in response. Usually he would give me shit for saying something like that, but his response made me think more about the whole scenario.

Now, I am almost sure his family bought it for me. When I last saw his parents, my future in-laws, over Thanksgiving they gave us an advent calendar (a traditional gift) and another gift they send not to open until Christmas with them on FaceTime. Therefore, I know that there is some kind of surprise planned. Even logistics-wise, the act of buying a car over the phone in another state and my partner picking the car up without me knowing and parking it seems really plausible for me. 

All of this thinking happened and I started to get really upset because I feel like I ruined something that could‚Äôve been awesome.

How do I move forward? Do I ask my partner about it? I don‚Äôt foresee being able to stop stressing about it, which is just going to ruin it more. ",1,1734983700.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hkvw3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hkvw3j/aitah_for_telling_my_mum_to_stop_talking_about_my/,AITAH for telling my mum to stop talking about my stepdad? ,"Okay, so... my mum(54F) and my stepdad (62M) were together for over 17 years, give or take, and married for 14.  But a few years ago, she said that his son (29M) was violent and chased us out of my stepdad's home, so my mum and I started living in an apartment together and my dad visited us whenever he could. I thought that would be it but they continued with their marriage and he continued being a weekend dad, so it wasn't a huge change other than the address. 

Fast forward two years ago, he was finally stepping up as a dad and being there for me not just on weekends, but also asking me how I was regularly and driving me to school. I was confused but really glad, you know? And then my mum springs on me that he had been more attentive because his son had moved out and she had stopped answering his texts. 

I figured ""maybe this won't be so bad, I have a dad now!"" 
Little did I know they would start using me as a carrier pigeon and a therapist all in one. He would ask me all the time about my mum and what he should do, asking me to please tell her X and to give her Y. She would listen and laugh about what an arse he was and that I shouldn't pay him any mind and such. This went on for months until my therapist (yes, I decided I should go back to therapy and thank goodness) advised me to be firm about my limits and not let them use me as a mailman. I did. 

They divorced. 

My stepdad stopped asking about my mum... and about me. 

My mum, on the other hand, had to be put a much firmer limit, cause she did not want to stop. But eventually, she did. 

This few months, with the holidays, have been a little rough on her. (Little context, she is a therapist and she has always thought my stepdad had a Narcissistic Personality Disorder.) 

So, she has been looking up videos on YouTube about getting out of Narcissistic relationships and such, but NPD and Psychopathy have a lot of symptoms in common and apparently, people love to exaggerate things online??? Huge shocker for her, really. 

She comes into my room and starts gushing about how my stepdad was probably a psychopath and she is so glad she got out of there before he hurt her! Could I imagine what would have happened? 

I got mad and told her to please stop, he was not a psychopath and we know better than to say that. 

She got extra mad and told me I am a better psychologist than she is and I always shut her up about what is important. She left to have coffee with her friends. 

I am mad but also... so tired. I miss my dad. I miss having a good relationship with my mum. She did study psychology, could it be that I am blinded by the lovebombing he did before actually abandoning me? Am I the asshole? ",2,1734983675.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

How do you stop being so solitary? I'm in my mid 20s, and a few years ago I lost the friend groups I had. Since then I haven't really had a group of friends and it's getting kind of lonely. I meet up with individual friends once every couple of weeks for a coffee or something but that's about it.

But I do think it is also a problem of my making- I don't tend to invite friends to do stuff with me! Now I'm a bit more grown I don't need a friend to tag along to do the usual life stuff like shopping or eating like I did as a first year at university. I see people do pot lucks with friends or go on trips or have group chats - wish I had those type of friendships! Only group chats I am in are work related.

So how do I go about cultivating those friendships? I already have friends, how do I go about making a friend group? 

I am also a big believer in community and do what I can in my neighbourhood but still haven't really got anyone I know or friends around, it's been pretty transactional (ie giving a tv to a neighbour, helping someone pay for the bus). ",2,1734983545.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

1hkvqm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmotionallyImmature/comments/1hkvqm6/do_i_accept_money_from_my_mother/,Do I accept money from my mother?,"First post here. I (27f) have been living on my own since age 18 besides the occasional stint of staying with my mom for a few months at a time, which always (especially the last time) ends poorly, because she ends up yelling at me, calling me names, shitting on my character, gaslighting me for having ""trauma,"" etc. 

Two years ago, I moved to a new city after living with her for a couple of months. This has triggered her in some way. When I moved here, she started calling me incessantly and I wasn't answering because I needed space after she had inserted herself into my life too much. I cut her out of my life for almost a year. My brother has also limited his contact with her for the last 6 years. In that time, I think she was able to do some reflecting, and she eventually started going to therapy, but she stopped. She also struggles with being on and off meds, for some reason she can't seem to take them consistently. I don't know what her meds are for or what her official diagnosis/es is/are, but she definitely struggles with some sort of mood disorder and depression if not BPD. I know she definitely has been diagnosed with OCD.

Anyway, this year during Thanksgiving, she decided to make a last minute trip to come visit me. She started crying and said she didn't want to be alone for the holiday, so (out of guilt) I told her she could come stay with me in my tiny studio apartment. She ended up staying for a WEEK, which felt outrageous to me. She spent so much money on gas, food, and even bought me a few gifts, and also rented out a cabin in the woods for a couple nights. All of it felt incredibly unnecessarily and the day before she left, she tried buying me a coffee, and her debit card got declined. She checked her bank account and her balance was -$100. She was shocked. She couldn't afford gas to get home because of this, and she said she couldn't use her credit cards because they are maxed out. I lent her $300 so she could get herself home.

After this trip, my boundaries feel extremely violated. A week ago, she started calling me again, and I genuinely just missed her calls because I was busy. She sent a very passive aggressive text saying she got a job interview near my city and that she will just cancel it because I ""clearly don't seem to want her around"" and accused me of ignoring her/not communicating. I clarified that I need my space to be my own person and figure out my life.

It wasn't until recently that I realized how badly I needed to get my finances in order. Growing up, my mom would always splurge on us any chance she got. Any time we had an excess amount of money, it was to be spent. If she got a bonus at work, we were going on a shopping spree. Big tax refund? Let's get a trampoline. I know she only wanted to make us happy but on the other hand, I had to scrounge for quarters for lunch money every week in high school and started working at 16 just so I could provide for myself. It was literally only a couple months ago when I had the realization that just because I have money, it doesn't mean I have to spend it.

Now, at age 27, I have hardly any savings but I at least have taught myself how to budget, am learning how to invest, and can hold a stable job. I am working to pay off my small amount of CC debt and have solid plans in place to grow my savings, etc. I make about $50k/year, probably more next year. My mom also makes $50k. She has no retirement fund and is 56. No savings whatsoever.

I am trying to move into a bigger apartment in the next few months, and my mom texted me this morning saying ""would it help you find a bigger apartment if I give you $100/month next year?"" I don't know what to say to her. Obviously this would be helpful, but she clearly doesn't know how to budget (her account over drafted because of auto payments she wasn't expecting). I can't tell if she is trying to manipulate me/make me feel like I owe her something or if she genuinely just really wants to help and giving me money has always been her way of showing me love. Part of me feels really uncomfortable accepting money from her right now because of how painfully aware I am of her financial situation, but the other part of me says I should take the money from her because that's what parents are for. 

I genuinely don't know what to do. I am leaning towards saying no, but I don't even know how to say this without upsetting her. Her carelessness is really freaking me out, especially the older I get. She doesn't take great care of herself and I'm terrified that once she starts having health issues I am going to have to be the one who's financially responsible and that I will somehow be swindled into taking care of her because she doesn't have anyone else in her life. She hardly has any close friends, she's single, and like I said, my brother has limited contact with her (and has also never had a job/lives with my dad and wouldn't be able to help out even if he wanted to).

My dad finally let go and passed on yesterday at noon. I'm not a spiritual or religious person so... It was weird for me. I'm sure it's weird for everyone but to me it just felt like he was sleeping. I spent so much of my life either being afraid, loving, or closed off from him. 

When he died we weren't close. He was mad that I didn't visit or call much and I was basically at a point of just giving up on the relationship all together because of the roughness of it. 

I spent a week with him in Hospice helping him get water, juice, coffee, Carona whenever he needed it because he couldn't use his hands much anymore. He would wake up frequently and try to turn on the TV full blast at 2am to which I'd have to stop him or have him turn it down because he lived in an elderly residential home and would be massively disturbing everyone. 

I see all these stories about how people have these beautiful moments with their parents as they are dying. They share stories, photos, watch movies together... My dad just wanted beer and two channels on all day long. 

Even when he died I felt as distant from him as I did when he was alive. It bugs me that I'll never really know who he was and even more that he never wanted me to know. 

Anyway. Rest in peace dad. Hope you're somewhere better off. Hope you're proud of me for... I don't know. Continuing on I guess.

I do have gum recession on a couple of my teeth (due to overbrushing), so I know this is contributing to the sensitivity. The dentist suggested a battery powered toothbrush, and reminded me to not brush too hard. I've tried really hard to keep this in mind when brushing.

I floss every day, and have never had a cavity. I've never had any serious dental work (had braces as a child). 

I don't know what to do, as I've followed everything the dentist has suggested. Do you have a good toothbrush suggestion that will help me with not brushing too hard? Do you have any other suggestions/advice as well?

1hkvm3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hkvm3e/save_an_adhd_girrrl_big_love_3/,Save an ADHD Girrrl - Big love <3,"Hello! First time posting here <3 Really sorry for the long post <3 After little medical support, thought I'd look to our community, hope that's ok <3 

I got diagnosed with combined ADHD in late January this year. I've just had my birthday, so I'm just gone 35 now. I asked my mam to send me to get checked as a birthday/xmas gift as getting evaluated in Ireland is so expensive. I was given 20mg Tyvense (named Vyvanse in all other places apparently!) and I was given freedom by the online psychiatrist to take 2 at times that suited me through the day. He said to try different times to suss out what my body and I needed. I really appreciated having the doctor trust me to find what worked for me, that meant a lot, but TBH, being given meds, and no skills/schedule/routine help, it wasn't the answer I longed for. He ended up leaving the country, so now my GP dispenses my meds. I have asked her if she could refer me to a recommend psychiatrist, but I've been left waiting months. Yes it helped me get into focus mode when I'm doing tasks on the laptop, but other than that, it's all a bit of a mess. And I thought the best thing to do is ask yourselves. 

I really suffer with sleep - I cut back on my one coffee & I'm now on decafe, and I drink super weak tea with milk. I'm, involved in the night/events industry so taking social drugs at the weekends became the norm for me for a number of years. Even though I've been known to party at events on the weekends, I never messed with anxiety meds. I felt that since I truly needed meds like these to help with having anxiety, I wanted them to work all my life, whenever I needed them/got them from a doctor, they were too important <3 

This year I stopped going out so much in hopes of working on my mental health/getting my adhd in better order, but I'm usually able to get proper sleep after being out. It seems the Tyvense is contributing to my sleep being outta wack. I was referred to my local mental health clinic after a bad mental health moment in September (I'd been coming off Escitalopram - it was the tail end, and I took E at a festival - been on a break from E since). BTW, the psychiatrist I saw in Jan, he recommended coming off it to see if the Tyvense could work best alone. I was also not finding it helpful with my anxiety after some time on it (see the heartbeat in my ears section!) I went to an after hours clinic (couldn't get a GP appointment) at a hospital, & the psychiatrist there was really sound and thought I'd benefit from care from a multi-disciplinary team, so I felt hopeful with the referral. It took 3 months to see anyone, and it was rubbish. I had a consult with an even faster speaking doc than myself, and I was sent on my way with 3 numbers for possible low cost D.B.T (dialectical behavioural therapy - it help BPD - definitely not as bad as it was in my teens!) - none of them did DBT and the clinic never got back to me with alternatives. At the mental health clinic, they told me they don't have resources to help people with ADHD and they didn't offer any help with my anxiety. 

The doc there did say to take the Tyvense at 7/8am - but as I work nights (when I do work), my routine getting out of bed is at 10/11am. What I've been trying to do lately, after the clinic doc recommending it, is taking 1 dose 20mg after breakfast when I'm shattered and need to go back to bed for a nap. I'm finding myself waking after intense vivid dreams and feeling very hot (I guess since its a stimulant). I can still be tired and struggling. I then take it mid/late afternoon when I have the latop out in a cafe to try get my hussle going/do social media/send emails etc- I'm a self employed artist. I had been taking my meds at 2pm when I'd get to a cafe to begin working, and then a few hours later. If you've been taking Tyvense, you may also know/have experienced, that the active time of the meds doesn't last very long, even though it claims to be a long release medication. 

I think ideally, meds in the morning (my morning time), meds in the afternoon for focus, and meds that are short release for my my night owl creativity burst (it feels like a happier/more productive time because the official work day is over for others - I feel less under pressure). 

I don't fall asleep most nights 5/6am - and I'm definitely too tired to get up and do something until I can sleep(I've looked into all the ideas!). I'm just lying there, trying to thaw my freezing limbs for an hour or two (I'm sure its Raynaud's but the GP doesn't take that seriously) - working on trying to make that better, then the OBV., using my phone for a bit- putting my random questions into google/watching a show(at least while I'm trying to thaw), and then I'm tossing & turning/feeling uncomfortable and I can't get my body to get into a deep breathing state with a slow heartbeat. That heavy sleep happens for me in the early/late morning. More recently when I was anxious about an event in the morning, I was unable to sleep at all! I've also been noticing for some time that my heartbeat was in my ear when I lay on my side - clearly expressing I am a CRONICALLY anxious human. The first psychiatrist (ADHD) also gave me some Rivotril (0.5mg) when starting the Tyvense and told me to take it whenever I needed it & not to try not to, but genuinely, take it whenever I needed to, due to adjusting onto the Tyvense. I only ever take halves (so 0.25) when my anxiety is really bad (physical chest anxiety/not sleeping for a couple of days etc) - I still have most the tablets there from January. I try not to rely on that and if I'm struggling with sleep, I take a third of a Nytol tablet. This year, probably due to the Tyvense in my system, its not easy to relax my body with either of these in the night, and often I may only find sleep again after 6am. 

Its hard having any type of normal day with my sleep being so messed up. I also feel a lot more down in the morning time than I do late at night. I'm more enthusiastic in the late evening, excited to begin projects/get things done. 

Q. Has anyone else with ADHD and a night owl schedule found a good medication routine for Tyvense (Vyvanse)?

Q. Are there other ADHD medications that might work better for me, considering my sleep problems? I'm afraid to give up the stimulants in case the alternatives don't work for me. 

Q. How do I know the meds are working the way they should be? I've chatted with friends who got diagnosed and they say it changed their lives - yes it has helped, but I don't magically only have one thought at a time/I sweat excessively/I still feel overwhelmed and unorganised in my life all the time - maybe its the dosage - I don't know if I was supposed to be up-titrated/I'm still taking that split dose. Are you feeling completely on top of your life and can get yourself organised task-wise/don't get anxiety or its really low now??

Q. Any help with the sleep sitch that isn't the obv sleep/room/hygiene ideas - I have Gemini-d the issue so many times!

  
Q. I'm not an easy going ADHD-er - so hoping I get to speak with other over thinker/mind hyperactive people for guidance / as well as the easy going ADHD-ers who I'd love to learn from - it just doesn't come naturally - If you have any ideas how I can get myself in a happier/less anxious state on the day to day - I'm so ready to make this a new chapter of my life being less of a worrier <3

Q. I've tried SO many apps/websites/paid through the teeth etc - for help with routines/schedules - they don't work for me. What has worked for you - if you're a creative/have to figure out your own routine - I'd love to hear more - from ACTUAL ADHD-ers instead of random ads/websites <3

Q. Any tips on figuring out how to BEGIN exercising - I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely unfit - I get short of breath going up the stairs. I've had 2 gym memberships over the past year - I've gone once to both! - the more easy/accessable/fun (doesn't feel like exercise!) - the better <3 

Hope this hasn't been too overwhelming for you reading this <3 Thank you ADHD lovelies <3 xxx",1,1734982884.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1hkvklj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1hkvklj/what_would_you_do_if_your_long_distance_boyfriend/,"What would you do if your long distance boyfriend proposed to you then never mentioned it again? 26 F, 29 M ","We‚Äôve been dating almost 5 years long distance. He‚Äôs from Europe im from the USA. 

I went to his country to help take care of his father who had cancer and it was going well until I left the country. His father immediately went downhill after I left and did pass away. 

The weird part with my BF is‚Ä¶ before I left he proposed to me but it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ normal- I don‚Äôt think. I want to know what you think of this? 

The way he fake proposed to me (it feels fake lol) seemed super last minute and  unplanned. I almost felt like his parents made him do it (he lives with his parents too) because WHY didn‚Äôt he propose when we went to Turkey a couple weeks before I left ? It would have been a perfect time. 

Or even just out on a walk together or a coffee date or a hike would have felt better than what he did. 

Ok so how he did it‚Ä¶ the morning I was leaving, like 3 am getting ready to walk out the door. We were about to pack the car, all my stuff is gathered by the garage door and we R under the stairs. He suddenly acts very nervous and paces around and I was like ‚ÄúR u okay what‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù And then he just did it- got on one knee and pulled out a ring‚Ä¶ I was shocked obviously 

I was already emotional and crying all AM and the night before because I was leaving him again, and it caught me soooo off guard to be proposed to. I was shocked and had no emotional reaction. I didn‚Äôt cry I didn‚Äôt feel good about it for some reason. Not sure why‚Ä¶ if it was just bc I was leaving ANYWAYS‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs cuz it was 3 AM‚Ä¶ or if it was because maybe I was a little disappointed with how it occurred? It all happened so fast it‚Äôs kind of a blur. 

But I remember having no positive emotions. It didn‚Äôt feel real. Prob cuz also when I said yes, he put the ring on and it didn‚Äôt fit. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I just said ‚Äúoh it doesn‚Äôt fit‚Äù and he took it back and said something like ‚Äúoh well have to fix it‚Äù 

It was a family heirloom so it makes me feel even more like his mom just handed him it the night before and said ‚Äúpropose to her!‚Äù 

He never even bought me a valentines gift before his Mom did though! Lol I was like‚Ä¶ thanks BF mom for my valentines gift. 

So he took the ring back, and we packed the car‚Ä¶ left for the airport. I was crying of course the whole time and when I left more crying. 

But the weird part is it just felt so fake for some reason and not real. And now I have no ring and I‚Äôm back home and he hasn‚Äôt mentioned it since. 

It‚Äôs been 9 months since the fake proposal happened. I know he‚Äôs been dealing with his father‚Äôs death too but idk how much longer I can do this. We talk less than ever & he even started hanging out with females that he does ‚ÄúCrossFit‚Äù with. 

On top of this, I was supposed to see him this summer and he said he couldn‚Äôt come anymore & cancelled with no real explanation beyond saying ‚ÄúI have to help my family with the business‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt ask me to come visit & didn‚Äôt make any new plans to see me. 

I‚Äôm feeling like I should just break up with him now bc it feels like a failed relationship and no end of the long distance in sight. 

But I always loved him so much and he‚Äôs my best friend.& I don‚Äôt want to break up. I want to escape the long distance. I want stability and peace. I just wish he would actually make our relationship real.

I never have had the love I need. My dad abandoned me as a child and I am craving a stable real relationship with all my heart. 

But I can‚Äôt speak his language, can‚Äôt work there, and he would need to provide for me and he does have generational wealth. But he‚Äôs immature and hasn‚Äôt taken any steps to take on his families business yet either. I‚Äôve been trying to get him to mature and learn from his father but he never did. He hasn‚Äôt shown any signs that he‚Äôs seriously trying to close our gap. 

I‚Äôve never dated anyone else besides him and never had a boyfriend from the USA never even been on a date with an American so it feels scary to break up with the one man I‚Äôve dated. The only person I‚Äôve ever felt a connection with. 

So rants over‚Ä¶ what would you do in my situation? Thanks for any advice. ",2,1734982772.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

1hkvj2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hkvj2o/somewhere_over_the_rainbow/,Somewhere over the rainbow,"A crowd of people ran in a multi-colored band of light ‚Äì a rainbow, at the end of which gold shone in a pot. People running sank into the rainbow, up to their ankles, knees, and others to their jaws, and finally fell into the abyss.



Mark was an average person ‚Äì he had average height, average job, average apartment and average aspirations. And this averageness started to bother him lately, like sleeping on a pea, maybe that's why he has these strange dreams? Never mind, it's time to get out of bed and turn on the app that will change his gray life. Invest AI ‚Äì that was the not very creative name of the tool, it was an assistant for investing in the stock market. How did it actually work? Nobody knew, because it was closed software, maybe it was trained on all available historical stock market data? Or maybe not entirely, because there are so-called. ""black swans"", or unexpected events, such as the invention of synthetic rubber at a time when astronomical costs had been incurred in creating infrastructure for obtaining natural rubber, due to which all previous attempts to bind the stock exchange with mathematics and statistics had come to nothing - at least that's how Robert, who knew about it, explained it to Mark, supposedly knew, Mark knew nothing at all, his profession was average as I mentioned above, and the stock exchange was supposed to be a tool to break out of mediocrity. Maybe he would know a little more, but the entrepreneurship lessons at his school were taught by Mrs. Zabska, who confused the class with a therapy office and spent most of her classes grumbling about her old man.



Mark was one of the rainbow runners, he ran up to another runner and gently tugged on his shirt ‚Äì ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù he gasped. The other one ‚Äì I know that much, we‚Äôre running to this pot of gold, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone succeed, some fell at the very end, we sink while running, if we stop we slowly start to emerge, people try different techniques, spinning, jumping, running in a zigzag to minimize the effect of sinking, what happens after falling ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs all.



He woke up again, drenched in sweat. A quick breakfast and coffee, and he sat down at the computer and the stock exchange. The tool indicated a great investment in rare element mines in Modena. This small African country was founded by one of the European colonial powers, then retaken by another. In the 1970s, on the wave of decolonization, the locals gained independence, because whites lost interest in maintaining the colonies; a decade later, rare elements were discovered and the country was enriched, which, however, mainly benefited the rulers.



Mark tried different running styles, but he was already knee-deep in the rainbow, he saw on one side more people falling, on the other side that his running partner, who had explained the rules of the game to him, although he had nodded long enough to be on the surface, had not started running again. What are you doing? ‚Äì asked Mark ‚Äì run! No ‚Äì replied the other ‚Äì I think I understand now, I'm staying here.



The strange nightmare was so real that our hero felt sore in the morning. Bad news awaited him at the computer. The minister, who owed his position to commissioning a study of the views of the residents of his constituency on various issues and asking his parish priest about the same, then taking the average and making it his election program, informed about the withdrawal of our diplomats from Modena due to a coup d'√©tat. The previous prime minister, with the help of the army, overthrew the pro-Western president, announced the nationalization of the mines, so that not foreign corporations but the people would profit from the wealth of their land. To make matters worse, the AI would not allow the sale of shares in the mine to recover even a scrap of invested money.





Mark was already quite close to the finish line, he lost sight of his friend and was already nose-deep in the rainbow. When he was only a few meters away from the pot, he fell, flying between the clouds, until suddenly everything went black. He opened his eyes to see that he was sitting in a cauldron of boiling liquid, two unfortunate people next to him in the same situation, and in the middle of the room appeared a winged creature with hooves and a goat's head, breathing fire from its mouth. Just as suddenly the creature changed into an old man with a thinning gray mane and a gray, crumpled suit and spoke ""well, enough of the theater, you are intelligent boys, we can do without these tricks to make you guess that I am the lord of evil. Evil in the broad sense, so to speak. Because you see, according to your monkey logic, if you punch your neighbor in the ass, evil will happen and you are the evildoer, but if you stand crookedly on the sidewalk and twist your ankle, evil will happen, but you do not consider yourselves evildoers. Here in this vestibule, which you usually call purgatory, this distinction does not count, I feed on evil, it does not matter whether the perpetrator does it intentionally, accidentally, or from above, no guilt in the earthly sense can be attributed to him"". Mark noticed that together with his companions in misery they were not sitting in steaming cauldrons but on chairs, with their hands tied with cable ties.



The hero's next wake-up call was not the most pleasant, but this time a pleasant surprise was waiting for him in the computer. The value of the shares of the Modenian mines that Mark had shot up and the AI bought large subsequent packages when investors terrified by the coup d'√©tat sold them at junk prices. Mark had just become a rich man. This was possible because a certain People's Front of Modenia marched on the capital and after several exchanges of fire with the army, restored the overthrown president to power, who immediately assured that the property of Western corporations in the country was not threatened. Upon closer examination, it began to get strange. No one had heard of the People's Front of Modenia before. It was mentioned only by a few blogs of unknown origin and an article in Wikipedia describing a provincial pro-Western movement, however, experts in this field expressed the assumption that it was a recent entry that had been backdated to look four years older. An investigative journalist put forward the thesis that in reality, unknown perpetrators had paid a group of international mercenaries who defeated the pro-government forces. However, a moment after sending the article to the editor, the journalist was shot. Mark was very confused, on the one hand the joy of the almost miraculous earnings, on the other the strange circumstances surrounding the topic; he glanced again at the Wikipedia article illustrated with a photo of the alleged warriors. They look like they were generated by artificial intelligence - he thought - created by AI; then cold sweat broke out on him.



Well gentlemen, but to emphasize that we are not in Versailles, it is time for some tradition ‚Äì the old man began, after which a fire with a rod lying in it appeared in front of him. I have chosen you three here now because of certain, let's say, differences in approach to the surrounding world. For a moment I considered sticking toothpicks under your fingernails, but let's solve this quickly, the weekend awaits ‚Äì he said, after which he grabbed the already heated rod with his bare hand. Well then ‚Äì he said and directed the rod towards the first one. He shouted ‚Äì Black Lord, I have always been on your side and I renounce God! Then he shouted when the rod reached his face. Maybe we can come to an agreement ‚Äì the second one replied ‚Äì I will do whatever you want, just don't burn me with it! The old man lowered his hand with the rod, smiled, then shouted ‚Äì you can't give me shit, you monkey and with a quick movement burned his face. Now he turned his gaze to Mark ‚Äì and you? What will you tell me, young man? F*ck off! ‚Äì he shouted back ‚Äì I don't want to have anything to do with you or anything you represent. The smile disappeared from the old man's face, he grabbed Mark by the arm with his other hand, he said ‚Äì don't fidget, you have these dreams, you are here because cancer is developing in your body unnoticed and that is why we are assessing where you will end up after everything. I will heal you. Well, that's it, run away to the valley of tears, the door is on the left hand side, check-up in fifty years.

I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love a good pair of earbuds, right? First off, these things look slick in black, and they fit comfortably in my ears. I‚Äôve had some earbuds before that felt like they were trying to take my ears on a camping trip‚Äîuncomfortable. But not these.

Let‚Äôs get into the sound quality. It‚Äôs Bose, so you kinda expect them to deliver, and they do. The noise cancellation is pretty top-notch. I was at a coffee shop with a blender going off like every five minutes, and these babies blocked it out like a charm. And the spatial audio? Makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a little concert hall. My cousin tried them out too, and he‚Äôs a bit of an audiophile. Gave them a thumbs-up, which in his world is high praise.

Battery life seems solid. I charged them overnight, and they easily lasted me through a full day of on-and-off listening. They claim around six hours, and it seems about right to me. The charging case is compact and gives you extra juice, which is handy if you‚Äôre forgetful like me.

But let‚Äôs talk Bluetooth connection. I‚Äôve had some earbuds that made me wanna pull my hair out because they‚Äôd keep dropping the connection. These were mostly stable, but I did have a couple of moments where they glitched for a second. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note.

And now the money talk. These aren‚Äôt exactly budget earbuds. Compared to some others like the Sony WF-1000XM4, they‚Äôre in the same price range, and they stack up well. Bose does a great job with noise cancellation, but Sony might have a slight edge on sound details. Depends on what you value more.

If you‚Äôre weighing these against the AirPods Pro, you‚Äôll find the Bose excels in noise cancellation and comfort, but the AirPods might win on seamless integration if you‚Äôre deep in the Apple ecosystem.

Overall, I‚Äôve been pretty happy with them. Sturdy, comfy, and they sound awesome, which is what you want, right? If you‚Äôre thinking of getting a pair, they‚Äôre definitely worth considering. Just don‚Äôt expect them to brew your coffee or anything!

I‚Äôm a 28 year old female alcoholic . I‚Äôve been in & out of the rooms for the last 5 years , but an alcoholic for 7. I absolutely love the rooms of AA, the love , the support and fellowship has really kept me going back. 
I‚Äôve tried just about everything imaginable to get sober. Outpatient rehab, inpatient rehab, therapy , medication , AA, being of service , working the steps, but for the last 3 years I‚Äôve only ever gotten 10 months of sobriety. No matter what i do ultimately when i feel that craving no distraction , phone call , or meeting has helped me stay away from that first drink . 
Anyway I‚Äôm not asking for a pity party‚Ä¶. I keep trying to get sober and what keeps me going is the thought of being out of my rock bottom . No car , no job , no income , loss of friendships , no trust with my family , strained relationships. I think about possibly one day having a normal life , to just get into my car, go run errands and get a coffee . Something simple .

I recently finished my master's in Germany and came back to India for Christmas vacation. Without giving it much thought, I reinstalled Hinge and started getting good matches (something that rarely happened in Germany). I made it clear to everyone I matched with that I was only here temporarily. I went on a few dates but this one stood out. I said bye to the others and focused on her. 
We've been on four dates till now - coffee, dinner, impromptu lunch, long drive(her bday). I'm usually nonchalant about first dates but god she's so cute and has so many of the qualities I'm looking for. Now, I have to fly back in a few days and face the problems there (I'm still looking for a job). I told her I really like her and want LDR, but she's already had two failed LDRs and they were within the country. She had promised herself she'll now look for a guy within the city but ended up liking me. Also she isn't opposed to moving abroad, just not right now as she's preparing for CA.
So now she's taking some time to think about it. Meanwhile, I'm debating the pros and cons too. Even I'm not sure I can handle it as I feel I require physical intimacy. Also my mother is pressuring me to get married when I get a job (AM situation, but she won't be opposed to gf) so I now want to date with intention. Is it delusional to think I've found someone special after just four dates? ls this doomed before it even begins? l'd love some perspective on whether it's worth pursuing or if I should just let it go.",2,1734982289.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

But for whatever reason, there are no articles or news out there telling about this scam. I find it really surprising. Now that we are back into the crypto speculation frenzy, I thought it would be a good idea to share this in the off-chance that anybody finds it and we make people think twice before falling into this kind of scams, or if you simply want to have some laughs.

So the story is this: 4 years ago a P2P platform was created in Latvia (Europe). As a start-up, they raised funding for their platform using an ICO, the token was called DEB. They have a whole white paper discussing how they were going to solve **worldwide** SMEs credit financing issues in their white paper: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-UhQ02DQksIVeVdWBbaDBwU8uwc3oyY/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-UhQ02DQksIVeVdWBbaDBwU8uwc3oyY/view) . You can read it, but the TLDR is that it is a lot of nonsense.

In an interview with the CEO (from now on in this post, the RAT), the fucking RAT said that the people who bought the token were ""not investors"" but more like ""contributors"". The token was expected to have a source of utility, and he admits that some people could have bought the token ""for speculative reasons"", others because they liked the project, etc.

In the same interview, the RAT said the market was going down and they would have a monitor to watch the price of their ETH and by the time they went to the kitchen to have coffee and back, they lost like $50k. They decided to sell all of their ETH for dirty fiat and the **17M went to 6M**!!! The initial shareholders (or should I say, ""contributors""), were angry and saying bad words to them for selling their ETH, that they ""do not understand"" etc etc. AND THE FUCKING RAT EVEN COMPLAINS THAT IT TOOK THEM A MONTH TO SELL THEIR POSITION BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH LIQUIDITY!!!

And you know what is the funny ending? The business was sold to another management team, the new management team said that they have nothing to do with that token and so they do not need to repay them or anything. The platform is still working today but it no longer offers internet coins.

Imagine for a second having Bitcoin reserves... And then when people want to sell there is not enough liquidity. it's fucking nuts if you ask me.",3,1734981661.0,Buttcoin,0,0.71,False

>###***A Torch of Liberty in a Sea of Oppression***

>***

>Welcome to the Second Roman Republic, a nation born through defiance, shaped by resilience, and united by the enduring belief in liberty. The Republic‚Äôs citizens see their country not just as a home but as a beacon of hope, a symbol of what can be achieved when a people refuse to succumb to tyranny. Here, liberty, creativity, and strength coexist in harmony, creating a society where every individual is empowered to live, think, and dream freely.

>This is a land where ancient ideals meet modern aspirations. From the bustling streets of Thessalonica to the serene shores of Salona, every city tells a story of renewal, courage, and determination. Whether you come seeking history, culture, adventure, or inspiration, the Second Roman Republic offers it all‚Äîand more.

>###**The Republic's Spirit: Liberty and Strength**

>At the heart of the Second Roman Republic is a culture that values liberty above all else. To its citizens, freedom is a sacred trust‚Äîa gift passed down from the ancestors and a responsibility to protect for future generations. This ethos shapes every facet of life in the Republic, from its politics to its art, from its culinary traditions to its martial spirit.

>The Republic‚Äôs values are woven seamlessly into its cultural fabric. Citizens of all genders and backgrounds participate equally in public life, united by a shared dedication to civic duty and personal freedom. This inclusivity extends to its vibrant religious and ethnic diversity. Roman polytheists worship alongside Christians, Muslims, Jews, and others, all under the protection of the **Edict of Toleration** that ensures religious freedom for all.

>The Second Roman Republic‚Äôs martial ethos is inseparable from its identity. Its citizens believe that liberty must be protected with both the sword and the pen, and they take pride in their role as custodians of these dual weapons. Military service is a cornerstone of civic life, seen not as a duty imposed by the state but as an honor embraced by free men and women. Every citizen of the Republic is trained in the basics of combat. This tradition, inspired by the Roman concept of the *Limitanei*, ensures that the populace is always ready to defend their nation. The martial culture extends beyond the battlefield. Physical fitness and combat skills are celebrated as vital aspects of personal development. Public arenas, known as Gymnasia Publica, serve as training grounds where citizens of all ages learn fencing, archery, and martial arts.  Strength‚Äîboth physical and intellectual‚Äîis celebrated in the Republic as a means to protect and sustain liberty. Citizens are taught that freedom requires vigilance and effort, and the Republic‚Äôs ethos of the **citizen-soldier** reflects this belief. Yet, strength is always tempered by wisdom; the sword is seen as a protector of justice, not a tool of conquest.

>###**A Cultural Tapestry**

>The Second Roman Republic is a symphony of cultures, harmonizing its Roman heritage with the countless local cultures of its constituents. Life here is shaped by an unwavering commitment to the ideals of ***[mos maiorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mos_maiorum)***, the ‚Äúcustoms of the ancestors,‚Äù interpreted through a contemporary lens. The people are deeply connected to their history, yet progressive and forward-thinking, creating a culture that is as dynamic as it is reverent.

>Public life is defined by very active civic engagement. Debate and rhetoric are as much a part of daily life as coffee and conversation. Caf√©s often host spirited discussions ranging from politics to philosophy. Visitors are encouraged to join in, as locals deeply respect intellectual curiosity and diverse perspectives, though we would advise you refrain from discussing deeply personal and contentious matters such as the outcome of the Byzantine War or the Republic's tense history with many of its neighbors.

>The arts flourish across the Republic, with mosaics and frescoes adorning public spaces. In Thessalonica‚Äôs Republican Academy of Arts, visitors can admire works that bridge the ancient and the modern: a marble statue of Jupiter beside an abstract depiction of resilience, crafted from reclaimed materials. Performances at the Theater of the People bring ancient Roman dramas to life, interspersed with modern plays that grapple with themes of exile, unity, and the human spirit.

>###**Practical Tips: Navigating the Republic**

>Traveling in the Second Roman Republic is a delight, but a few cultural nuances can help you make the most of your visit. Respect for liberty is deeply ingrained, and locals value open-mindedness and intellectual engagement. Striking up a conversation‚Äîwhether in a caf√©, a market, or a museum‚Äîis not just welcomed but expected when approached.

>Public transportation is efficient, with sleek trams and buses connecting major hubs. Renting a bicycle or electric chariot offers a more leisurely way to explore Thessalonica‚Äôs winding streets and scenic boulevards.

>When visiting sensitive areas like the **[Danube Defense Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1ezhksa/conflictsecret_praemonitus_praemunitus/)** or the **[Theodosian Walls](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1de0zbp/secret_the_eagle_still_has_talons/)**, show respect for the Republic‚Äôs vigilance and refrain from discussing contentious topics like Japan or the Garden unless invited to do so. Dress modestly when visiting religious or historical sites, and greet locals with a warm ***Salve!***‚Äîa simple gesture that earns immediate goodwill.

>###**Flavors of the Republic**

>Dining in the Second Roman Republic is an immersive journey through time and taste. The cuisine pays homage to Roman culinary traditions while embracing local influences. Imagine sitting in a sun-dappled courtyard, the scent of freshly baked **panis militaris** mingling with the sharp tang of **garum redux**, a modern interpretation of the ancient fish sauce. Plates of roasted lamb drizzled with honey and thyme arrive alongside **puls**, a rich barley porridge once favored by Roman soldiers but now elevated with truffle oil and seasonal vegetables.

>Dyracchium‚Äôs food markets are an explosion of color and flavor. Vendors beckon with ripe figs, briny olives, and wheels of cheese wrapped in vine leaves. At the waterfront, restaurants serve freshly caught seafood paired with **vinum novum**, a locally produced wine aged in amphorae to infuse it with earthy, ancient notes. For dessert, indulge in **patrician honey cakes**, their sweetness offset by the crunch of toasted almonds.

>###**Festivals: Living the Spirit of Liberty**

>Time your visit to coincide with one of the Republic‚Äôs dynamic festivals, and you‚Äôll witness a society that knows how to honor its ideals while embracing the joy of living freely.

>The annual **Dies Libertatis** is more than a holiday‚Äîit is a declaration of the Republic‚Äôs undying commitment to freedom. The streets of Thessalonica erupt in parades where citizens wear togas adorned with golden laurels, reenacting the Republic‚Äôs struggle against tyranny. At night, fireworks light up the Aegean, casting shimmering reflections on the waves as choirs sing the hymns to **[Libertas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertas)**.

>During Saturnalia, the winter festival, citizens engage in a week-long celebration that includes feasting, dancing, and gift-giving. It‚Äôs a time when the Republic‚Äôs liberal ethos shines brightest, reminding everyone that freedom thrives in unity and joy.

>###**The Music of the Republic: A Unique Symphony of Liberty**

>Music in the Second Roman Republic is as dynamic and diverse as the nation itself, reflecting the ideals of liberty and individuality. What sets the Republic apart is its unique ability to blend influences from across time and space, creating a soundscape that is both nostalgic and innovative. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Republic‚Äôs love for American classics and its mastery of House music, which combine with Roman traditions to produce a music scene unlike any other in the world.

>**The American Influence: Songs of Freedom**

>The Republic‚Äôs fascination with American classics from the 1970s to the early 2000s stems from their shared themes of freedom, rebellion, and self-expression. Artists like Bruce Springsteen, Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Madonna are embraced as cultural icons whose music resonates deeply with the Republic‚Äôs ethos. Their songs have been adopted as anthems of personal and collective liberty, often played in caf√©s, public squares, and during festivals.

>**House Music: The Soundtrack of Modern Liberty**

>What makes the Republic‚Äôs music scene truly unique is its embrace of House music as the foundation for innovation. This genre‚Äôs flexibility, continuous beats, and rhythmic structure provide the perfect canvas for blending old and new. Roman artists have mastered the art of infusing House music with elements of American classics, Roman marching rhythms, and even ancient melodies played on instruments like the lyre and aulos.

>In vibrant clubs across the nation, DJs remix tracks that seamlessly integrate the haunting chants of Byzantine choirs with the driving beats of House, punctuated by guitar riffs inspired by Springsteen or Fleetwood Mac. The result is an electrifying fusion that fills dance floors and resonates deeply with the Republic‚Äôs celebration of creativity.

>**New Genres and National Hits**

>The Republic has also given rise to entirely new genres, such as Neo-Byzantine Beat, which combines traditional Roman instruments with the electronic pulse of House. Bands like Aquila Rising have gained domestic acclaim, their music embodying the Republic‚Äôs commitment to blending heritage with innovation. These songs often feature lyrics that celebrate resilience, self-determination, and the triumph of the human spirit.

>###**Film in the Second Roman Republic: Liberty on the Silver Screen**

>In the Second Roman Republic, cinema is more than entertainment‚Äîit is a powerful expression of the enduring human spirit. The Republic‚Äôs film industry, often referred to as **Cinematica Romana**, reflects its citizens‚Äô deep commitment to storytelling as a vehicle for exploring themes of resilience, freedom, and the complexities of human nature. Drawing inspiration from its Roman heritage, the Republic has developed a cinematic culture that blends historical grandeur with bold experimentation, making it one of the most dynamic film industries in the modern world.

>The roots of Cinematica Romana can be traced to the Republic‚Äôs early days, when filmmakers sought to use the medium to tell the story of their nation‚Äôs rebirth. These early films were grand historical epics that reimagined the struggles of ancient Rome alongside the Republic‚Äôs own fight for liberty. Titles like ***The Siege of Alesia*** and ***From Rubicon to Resurgence*** became instant classics, their sweeping narratives and elaborate sets capturing the imaginations of audiences both at home and abroad.

>Over time, the Republic‚Äôs film industry diversified, embracing a wide range of genres while maintaining a focus on themes of justice, self-determination, and human dignity. Today, Cinematica Romana produces everything from gripping political thrillers to introspective dramas, cutting-edge science fiction, and even experimental art films.

>Liberty is the beating heart of Roman cinema. Films often explore the tension between freedom and oppression, highlighting the moral and physical struggles required to protect one‚Äôs ideals. Stories set in historical contexts‚Äîsuch as the fall of the Roman Monarchy or the resistance against foreign invaders‚Äîserve as allegories for contemporary issues, inviting audiences to reflect on the cost and value of freedom.

>One of the most celebrated films of recent years, ***The Flame Never Dies***, chronicles the life of a young woman who becomes a leader in Italy‚Äôs early resistance movements. Through her journey, the film examines the sacrifices required to uphold liberty, blending moments of intimate vulnerability with sweeping, visually stunning battle sequences. The film won the **Aquila d‚ÄôOro**, the Republic‚Äôs highest cinematic honor, and was praised for its powerful storytelling and groundbreaking cinematography.

>Roman cinema is renowned for its distinctive visual style, which combines classical aesthetics with modern techniques. Cinematographers often draw inspiration from the symmetry and grandeur of Roman architecture, creating compositions that evoke a sense of timelessness and order. At the same time, they are unafraid to experiment with bold colors, unconventional framing, and innovative special effects to challenge traditional storytelling norms.

>Directors frequently incorporate Roman iconography into their work, from laurel wreaths and imperial eagles to mosaics and fresco-inspired backdrops. These visual motifs serve not only as nods to the Republic‚Äôs heritage but also as symbols of the enduring relevance of its ideals.

>True to the Republic‚Äôs intellectual culture, its films often delve deeply into philosophical questions. Screenwriters craft dialogue that challenges audiences to think critically about morality, governance, and the human condition. In the political thriller ***Senatus et Populus***, for example, a debate between two senators over the limits of individual freedom becomes the emotional and intellectual centerpiece of the film, leaving audiences pondering its implications long after the credits roll.

>Even action-packed blockbusters incorporate moments of reflection. In ***The Shield of Liberty***, a high-octane war film loosely based on the fall of Rhodes, the protagonist‚Äôs internal conflict about the consequences of wartime decisions provides a layer of depth that elevates the story beyond its genre conventions.

>Film festivals like the Salona Cinematica Festival and the Golden Horn Film Week provide platforms for these emerging voices. Held annually, these festivals draw filmmakers and cinephiles from around the world, turning the Republic‚Äôs cities into hubs of creative energy and exchange.

>Much like its music scene, the Republic‚Äôs film culture is heavily influenced by American classics, particularly those from the Golden Age of Hollywood and the indie boom of the late 20th century. Films like ***Casablanca, To Kill a Mockingbird***, and ***The Matrix*** are celebrated for their exploration of freedom, justice, and individuality. These works have inspired Roman filmmakers to reinterpret similar themes within their own cultural context.

>The Republic‚Äôs love for American cinema is evident in its thriving industry of remixes and reimaginings. The critically acclaimed ***Julius***, for instance, is a Roman adaptation of ***The Godfather*** that recontextualizes its themes of loyalty and power within the political intrigue of ancient Rome. Meanwhile, ***Empire Electric*** pays homage to the science fiction classic ***Blade Runner*** while exploring the ethical dilemmas of AI in a Roman setting.

>In the Republic, going to the movies is a communal event. Open-air theaters are a popular feature in cities like Heraklion and Andautonia, where citizens gather under the stars to watch films projected onto massive screens. These gatherings often include pre-screening debates and post-film discussions, turning the experience into a celebration of art and ideas.

>The Cinematica Circles, citizen-led film clubs, are another unique feature of the Republic‚Äôs film culture. These clubs meet regularly to watch and discuss films, fostering a grassroots appreciation for cinema that cuts across age, class, and regional divides.

>The Republic‚Äôs government recognizes cinema as a vital cultural and intellectual resource. The Ministry of Arts and Culture offers grants and subsidies to filmmakers, ensuring that voices from all corners of society can be heard. Special programs are in place to preserve classic Roman films and restore archival footage, safeguarding the nation‚Äôs cinematic heritage for future generations.

>For visitors, experiencing the film culture of the Second Roman Republic offers a unique window into its soul. Whether watching an epic historical drama in a grand theater or discussing an experimental indie film with locals in an Istrian caf√©, you will find yourself immersed in a world where storytelling and freedom go hand in hand.

>###**Cities of the Republic: A Journey**

>The Second Roman Republic is a mosaic of cities, each offering its own unique flavor of culture and history. From bustling metropolises to tranquil coastal havens, every destination tells a story of resilience and renewal.

>###**Thessalonica: The Radiant Capital**

>Thessalonica is no ordinary capital‚Äîit is the soul of the Republic, a city that thrives on its belief in the transformative power of freedom. Sitting proudly on the Aegean coast, its skyline is an arresting mosaic of ancient arches, Byzantine domes, and modern glass towers. At every turn, the city tells the story of its people: resilient, free-thinking, and driven by an unyielding love for liberty.

>Begin your journey in the **Forum Novum**, the Republic‚Äôs beating heart. This sprawling plaza is alive with vibrant commerce, musicians playing odes to liberty, and artists capturing the vibrant energy of their homeland. Surrounding the forum are landmarks that embody the Republic‚Äôs ideals: the **Curia**, where the Senate debates under gilded murals of Rome‚Äôs greatest orators, and the **Arch of Liberty**, built after ***Princeps'*** **[Maximus' victory in Coliseum saved his fellow citizens from crucifixion](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dn1ret/alert_rome_in_defiance_of_god/)**, carved with scenes of the Republic‚Äôs defiance against tyranny.

>Venture deeper into the city, and you‚Äôll find yourself in neighborhoods where the past meets a forward-thinking present. In the district of **Aventinus Libertatis**, a hub for activists, graffiti murals proclaim bold slogans of agitation against the powers at be while street performers reenact historic moments from the Republic‚Äôs founding. Thessalonica does not merely preserve history‚Äîit lives it, breathes it, and challenges its citizens to redefine it every day.

>###**Constantinople: The Eternal City in the Shadow of Vigilance**

>Constantinople, the ""Eternal City,"" is a place where history and strategy are inextricably linked. Its imposing walls, gleaming domes, and vibrant streets tell the story of a city that has stood at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. As the capital of the **Constantine Military District**, which stretches from Kallipolis to Constantinople along the Sea of Marmara, the city serves as both a cultural heart of the Republic and a frontline bastion against external threats. This duality defines Constantinople‚Äîa city caught between its aspirations for renewal and the realities of its militarized existence.

>**A Fortress City of Strategic Importance**

>Constantinople is the nerve center of the Constantine Military District, a region that safeguards one of the Republic‚Äôs most vulnerable yet core territories. Its strategic location at the junction of Europe and Asia, along the narrow Bosphorus strait, has made it a coveted prize throughout history. Today, the Republic ensures its security with a formidable combination of modern defenses.

>The **Walls of Theodosius**, which successfully repelled countless invaders over the centuries, remain a central feature of the city. These ancient stone barriers have been reinforced and upgraded with modern technology. Military drills are a common sight, and the city‚Äôs skies are often streaked with the contrails of jet fighters on training runs.

>Yet, the militarization of Constantinople does not stifle its spirit. Its citizens view this vigilance as a continuation of the city‚Äôs legacy‚Äîa modern-day iteration of the same resilience that allowed Constantinople to withstand the great **[Siege of 717-718 CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(717%E2%80%93718))**, when Leo III the Isaurian led its defense against a massive Umayyad army.

>**Leo III the Isaurian: A Guardian in Spirit**

>The memory of **[Leo III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_III_the_Isaurian)**, the Byzantine emperor whose leadership saved Constantinople during one of its darkest hours, is deeply woven into the fabric of the city. Though centuries have passed since the siege, the people of Constantinople have embraced Leo III as a symbolic figure of strength, resilience, and ingenuity ever since the city survived its attempted capture by the Slayer. His image, often rendered in graffiti or mosaics, is ubiquitous throughout the city. While a Christian emperor, he is viewed in a secular light as Constantinople's greatest protector.

>One striking mural near the Golden Horn depicts Leo astride a warhorse, holding aloft a blazing torch‚Äîa symbol of defiance and hope. Elsewhere, small shrines in public squares and markets feature his likeness, accompanied by inscriptions recounting his victory during the siege. These depictions are unofficial, yet their frequency speaks volumes about the admiration the citizens hold for Leo as a protector and symbol of the city's enduring spirit.

>Leo‚Äôs story resonates deeply in Constantinople, where the city‚Äôs current militarized state feels like a modern echo of its past as a fortress under siege. His legacy serves as a reminder that strength and resilience are not just necessary but noble qualities in the defense of liberty. For many citizens, invoking Leo III is less about reverence and more about a shared cultural understanding of what it takes to preserve a way of life.

>**A City Balancing Vigilance and Renewal**

>Despite its militarized reality, Constantinople remains steadfast in its commitment to reclaiming its historical identity as a center of culture, learning, and artistry. The Republic views the city as a jewel of its heritage, and significant efforts have been made to restore its grandeur even amidst the demands of security.

>The Hagia Sophia stands as a testament to this restoration effort. Inside, its golden mosaics and soaring domes inspire awe, blending the city‚Äôs Byzantine past with the Republic‚Äôs forward-thinking ethos. A new addition to the Hagia Sophia is a hall dedicated to Leo III, showcasing artifacts from the era of the siege, including replicas of the fire-siphons used to deploy Greek Fire, the legendary weapon credited with turning the tide of the battle.

>Public spaces throughout Constantinople reflect a similar balance. The Golden Horn, once a site of great naval battles, has had its shoreline revitalized as a bustling promenade filled with caf√©s, markets, and street performers. Citizens and visitors enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, sampling freshly grilled fish and locally brewed wine under the vigilant eye of the Roman Army. Murals of Leo III often appear here, tucked into alleyways or painted boldly on walls, creating a juxtaposition between the city‚Äôs history as a fortress and its aspirations for peace.

>**Cultural Vibrancy Amidst Strategic Significance**

>Constantinople thrives as a cultural hub, despite‚Äîor perhaps because of‚Äîits militarized character. Its theaters and concert halls regularly host performances that draw on the city‚Äôs storied past, blending Byzantine chants with modern compositions inspired by themes of resilience and liberty. One particularly popular annual play, **The Siege and the Fire**, dramatizes the events of 717-718, with a focus on Leo III‚Äôs ingenuity and the unity of Constantinople‚Äôs citizens.

>In the markets, visitors can find stalls selling everything from intricate mosaics and handcrafted jewelry to military memorabilia and miniature replicas of the city‚Äôs iconic walls.

>**A Visit to the Eternal City**

>To visit Constantinople is to step into a living narrative of resilience and renewal. It is a city that embodies the dual ideals of strength and culture, of vigilance and freedom. Walk along the Walls of Theodosius and imagine the soldiers who once defended them. Stand beneath the dome of the Hagia Sophia and feel the weight of history and hope. Explore the murals and graffiti of Leo III and understand the deep pride and identity that bind the city‚Äôs past and present.

>Constantinople is not just a fortress or a relic; it is a thriving, dynamic city where the lessons of history guide the vision of the future. It is a place that reminds visitors of the strength required to protect liberty and the creativity needed to nurture it.


>###**Athens: The Cradle of Democracy**

>Athens, the birthplace of democracy, is both a living museum and a thriving modern city. The Acropolis, with its iconic Parthenon, stands as a symbol of the Republic‚Äôs shared cultural heritage with ancient Greece. Below its slopes, the **Agora Nova** serves as a vibrant marketplace and gathering place, echoing the democratic spirit of Athens‚Äô past.

>The city is also a hub of learning and creativity. The **Athenian Lyceum**, a modern institution inspired by Aristotle‚Äôs teachings, offers lectures and workshops that explore the intersection of ancient philosophy and contemporary issues. In the evenings, open-air theaters come alive with performances that delve into themes of freedom, justice, and humanity‚Äôs enduring quest for meaning.

>###**Serdica: The Mountain Jewel**

>Nestled in the shadow of the Balkan Mountains, Serdica (former Sofia) is a city of natural beauty and cultural richness. Known for its mineral springs and lush gardens, Serdica offers a tranquil retreat for those seeking relaxation and inspiration.

>The city‚Äôs Roman Amphitheater hosts concerts and festivals that draw artists and audiences from across the Republic. Meanwhile, the **Gardens of Libertas**, a sprawling park filled with statues and fountains, provide a serene setting for reflection and connection.

>###**Dyracchium: The Gateway to the Adriatic**

>Dyracchium (former Durr√´s) is a bustling port city that has long been a vital link between the Republic and the wider world. Its historic harbor, once a key hub of Roman trade, is now a lively center of commerce and tourism. Along the waterfront, bars and caf√©s serve fresh seafood paired with local wines, while the city‚Äôs nightlife offers a vibrant mix of music, dance, and celebration.

>###**Singidunum: The Fortress of Freedom**

>Perched on the banks of the Danube, Singidunum (former Belgrade) is a city of resilience and innovation. Its strategic location has made it a key defensive stronghold, and the **Danube Defense Line** that runs north of the city stands as a testament to the Republic‚Äôs commitment to security and freedom.

>Singidunum is also a hub of creativity and craftsmanship. The **Artisans‚Äô Quarter** is home to workshops where master craftsmen and inventors collaborate, creating everything from Roman-inspired jewelry to cutting-edge technologies.

>###**Emona: The Alpine Haven**

>Nestled in the Julian Alps, Emona (former Ljubljana) is a city of breathtaking natural beauty and forward-thinking ideals. Its cobblestone streets wind through a picturesque landscape of rivers, forests, and mountains, making it a haven for nature lovers and adventurers.

>The city is a leader in sustainability, with innovative projects that harmonize urban life with environmental preservation. Visitors can explore the **Green Forum**, a park that combines art, nature and architecture with sophisticated eco-friendly designs.

>###**Salona: A Coastal Gem**

>On the Dalmatian coast lies Salona (former Split), a serene city where ancient architecture meet Mediterranean charm. Its pristine beaches and azure waters make it a favorite destination for relaxation, while the Roman Forum of Salona and the Republic Maritime Museum offer a window into the region‚Äôs rich history.

>***

>###**Natural Wonders: The Republic‚Äôs Breathtaking Geography**

>The Second Roman Republic is a land of stunning natural beauty. From the snow-capped Julian Alps to the turquoise waters of the Adriatic, the Republic‚Äôs geography is as varied as it is magnificent.

>**Mount Olympus: The Throne of the Gods**

>About an hour and a half drive from Thessalonica, Mount Olympus rises majestically into the heavens. Steeped in mythology, this sacred mountain offers a spiritual and physical journey for hikers and nature lovers. Trails wind through dense forests and rocky outcrops, eventually leading to breathtaking vistas where the Republic‚Äôs cities and coastlines stretch out below.

>**The Julian Alps: A Paradise for Adventurers**

>In the Republic‚Äôs western provinces, the Julian Alps offer a dramatic contrast to its coastal plains. These rugged peaks, crowned with snow for much of the year, are a haven for hikers, skiers, and climbers. The alpine meadows surrounding Emona are home to rare flora and fauna, providing a tranquil escape for those seeking solitude in nature.

>**The Danube River: Separating Humanity from Beasts**

>Flowing through cities like Singidunum, the Danube is both a lifeline and a source of inspiration. Its banks are dotted with vineyards, castles, and ancient ruins, creating a landscape rich in history and charm. River cruises allow visitors to explore the Republic‚Äôs northern border, passing through serene countryside and vibrant urban centers while also appreciating that this body of water is a crucial barrier separating the free from the oppressed.

>**The Adriatic Coast: A Mediterranean Gem**

>The Republic‚Äôs Adriatic coastline is a jewel of unspoiled beauty. From the historic harbor of Dyracchium to the pristine beaches of Salona, the coast offers endless opportunities for relaxation and exploration. Visitors can sail across turquoise waters, explore hidden coves, or simply bask in the Mediterranean sun.

>**The Aegean: Cradle of Civilization**

>The Aegean Sea, with its azure waters and scattered islands, is a defining feature of the Republic‚Äôs geography. Chania's waterfront provides stunning views of this iconic seascape, while smaller coastal towns offer a quieter, more intimate connection to the sea. Fishing villages and bustling ports alike provide a window into the Republic‚Äôs maritime heritage, which stretches back millennia.

***

2. Should I follow up, or just give her space?

Nbd, I was about to explain I'm on a date and politely send him on his way, but then dude straight up gets on one knee and freaking proposes!!! 

Like, wth, I am literally on a date here! And marrying this dude would throw off my whole dynamic! (plus, marriage = commitment = eeewwww!) 

So of course, I turned him down. He got a little butthurt about it, but I thought everything was cool. New guy took it like a champ, and we went back to our conversation like nothing happened. 

Things started to get a little steamy, so we headed upstairs for obvious reasons, only to discover *marriage dude had broken into my house and was just sitting there playing on my computer!*

I sent him home and went back to my new guy, but dude just sat there on the computer. The whole time. Watching us. It was sooo creepy when I looked up after and realized he was still there. So I sent new guy home and promised to call him tomorrow, and then broke up with marriage dude. He...was not happy. And he STILL refused to leave! I had to actually delete the computer to get him out of my house. And locked both it and the front door as soon as he was gone. 

But now he keeps showing up every few days and knocking over my trash cans. Doesn't ring my doorbell, doesn't say hi, doesn't even seem to want to talk to me anymore (that's cool, I don't wanna talk to him either, and every time I see him I feel this simmering rage cause, like, the audacity!). But he just keeps knocking over my trash cans! 

So, WIBTA if I went out there one day when he does it and just beat the crap out of him? Do you think he'd stop, or would that just make it worse?

Let's face it, bad breath can be a real kick in the teeth. It can make you self-conscious, affect your social interactions, and even impact your professional life. You‚Äôve probably tried everything from mints and gum to mouthwash and tongue scrapers, but nothing seems to work long-term. So you‚Äôre wondering about something more‚Ä¶ robust. Something like a professional deep cleaning at the dentist. A sensible thought! But does a deep cleaning *really* help with bad breath? Well, grab a cup of coffee (maybe not right before your appointment!), and let's dive deep into the nitty-gritty of this stinky situation.

Does a Deep Cleaning Help with Bad Breath?
------------------------------------------

Before we get into the specifics, let's define what we're talking about. A ""deep cleaning"" at the dentist isn't just a fancy term for a regular cleaning; it's a procedure known as scaling and root planing. Think of your teeth like icebergs ‚Äì there's the part you see above the gumline, and then there's a whole lot more going on beneath the surface. Plaque and tartar can build up below the gumline, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. This bacterial party is a major culprit behind bad breath, also known as halitosis. Scaling and root planing removes these unwanted guests, getting to the root of the problem (pun intended!).

### Understanding the Causes of Bad Breath

Believe it or not, sometimes bad breath isn't just about your oral hygiene. Sure, skipping brushing and flossing is a recipe for dragon breath, but there are other factors at play. Certain foods like garlic and onions can linger in your system, while medical conditions like dry mouth and acid reflux can also contribute to the issue. Even certain medications can dry out your mouth, making it a haven for odor-causing bacteria. So, before blaming your teeth entirely, consider if other factors might be fanning the flames of your halitosis.

- **Lifestyle factors:** Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and certain diets can contribute to bad breath.
- **Medical conditions:** Dry mouth (xerostomia), sinus infections, diabetes, and liver or kidney problems can cause bad breath.
- **Oral hygiene:** Neglecting brushing, flossing, and regular dental checkups allows plaque and tartar to build up.

### How Scaling and Root Planing Banishes Bad Breath

So, back to our original question: does a deep cleaning help with bad breath? The short answer is: often, yes! By removing the plaque and tartar that harbor those smelly bacteria from below the gumline, a deep cleaning can significantly improve your breath. It's like pulling the weeds out by the roots instead of just trimming the tops. This process also helps to smooth out the roots of your teeth, making it harder for bacteria to cling on in the future. Think of it as giving your gums a fresh start.

1. **Removes the source:** Scaling and root planing eliminate the bacterial colonies hiding below the gums, directly targeting the cause of the odor.
2. **Reduces gum inflammation:** The bacteria causing bad breath also contribute to gum disease. By removing them, the deep cleaning process can improve gum health and reduce inflammation.
3. **Creates a cleaner environment:** Smooth tooth roots make it more difficult for bacteria to re-attach, creating a less hospitable environment for odor-causing microbes.

Does a Deep Cleaning Help with Bad Breath: Long-Term Solutions
--------------------------------------------------------------

While a deep cleaning can be incredibly effective, it's not a magic bullet. Maintaining fresh breath requires consistent effort. Imagine cleaning your house from top to bottom; it looks fantastic, right? But if you don‚Äôt keep tidying up, the mess will inevitably return. The same principle applies to your mouth. A deep cleaning sets the stage for good oral hygiene, but you need to keep up the good work to keep those pesky bacteria at bay.

### Maintaining Fresh Breath After a Deep Cleaning

Once you‚Äôve had a deep cleaning, your dentist might recommend specific mouthwashes or rinses to further combat bad breath. They might also suggest lifestyle changes like drinking more water and quitting smoking. Think of these recommendations as your post-cleaning maintenance plan.

- **Brush and floss diligently:** This is the cornerstone of good oral hygiene.
- **Use a tongue scraper:** Your tongue can be a breeding ground for bacteria, so scraping it daily can make a big difference.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and bacteria.
- **Chew sugar-free gum:** Gum stimulates saliva production, which helps neutralize acids and wash away debris.
- **Visit your dentist regularly:** Regular checkups and cleanings are crucial for preventing plaque and tartar buildup.

Does a Deep Cleaning Help with Bad Breath: When to See Your Dentist
-------------------------------------------------------------------

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

If your bad breath persists despite your best efforts, it‚Äôs time to see a professional. Don‚Äôt wait until your breath could knock someone out ‚Äì early intervention is key. Your dentist can determine if a deep cleaning is necessary or if there are underlying medical issues contributing to your halitosis.

### Identifying the Need for a Deep Cleaning

Persistent bad breath, bleeding gums, and swollen or tender gums can be signs that you need a deep cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate your oral health and recommend the appropriate course of action. Think of your dentist as a detective, investigating the source of your breathy woes.

- **Persistent bad breath:** Even after brushing and flossing.
- **Bleeding gums:** A tell-tale sign of gum disease.
- **Swollen or tender gums:** Another indicator of potential gum problems.
- **Receding gums:** This exposes more of your tooth root, making it more susceptible to bacterial buildup.

Sometimes, bad breath can be a symptom of something more serious. Your dentist can help rule out any underlying medical conditions and provide you with the best advice for tackling your halitosis. Isn‚Äôt it better to be safe than sorry? Don't let bad breath hold you back; getting to the bottom of the issue ‚Äì and beneath the gumline! ‚Äì can drastically improve your oral health and your confidence.

Conclusion
----------

So, does a deep cleaning help with bad breath? It certainly can! By removing the bacterial breeding grounds lurking beneath the gums, a deep cleaning can dramatically freshen your breath. However, remember that good oral hygiene practices are crucial for maintaining long-term results. Think of it this way: a deep cleaning is like hitting the reset button, but it‚Äôs up to you to keep your breath fresh and clean moving forward.

Fireworks right from the start, our first coffee date was 6 hours long, flow of conversation was easy - we both admitted we could have gone 10 hours type deal.

Spent the next few meet ups at her house meeting her kids (4 kids, I have none), had a few sleepovers, everything great, her kids really seemed to like me. We all watched a few movies, did a lot of sitting and talking (constant joking), it all felt way too smooth.

We text a lot over this time, most of it cutesy type stuff - telling each other we missed each other and couldn't wait to see each other again, a lot of selfies back and forth - seemed like genuine chemistry. 

She hinted a few times at how she'd like to be official, so on our last sleepover I asked her if she wanted to officially be my girlfriend. She said yes. Great. This was 3 nights ago.

The next 2 days she proceeded to hardly respond to my texts (she had a sick kid and she's been trying to get ready for Christmas) and dropped all intimacies between the two of us. I tried not to let it bug me too much, people get busy, life takes over, didn't want to come off too needy.

When she finally got around to responding to me yesterday (I wasn't repetitively texting her)  she mentioned she had her ex and his kid over for the day building gingerbread houses (they have no kids together) and it was a busy day and didn't get much of her cleaning done. Prior she had said she wasn't sure if she could fit in us seeing each other again before Christmas, being a new relationship - I kind of prefer it that way. Id rather not impose on her family as Christmas is pretty important to kids/with kids. But with the ex this is where the red flags started popping off for me.

So I shot her a text stating as much, that the instant lack of intimacy once we ""official"" coupled with her seeing her ex whom she had never mentioned plans with prior and a few other things were kind of bothering me (I added her on Facebook the night we went official and she's yet to accept the request - I'm not big on social media to begin with so this wouldn't bother me if it wasn't for the other information).   
  
She told me that she's really scared we are moving too quickly and that she's got kids to think about, didn't acknowledge my issues with her seeing the ex at all. I told her I'm really confused as her kids really seem to enjoy having me over, but that I understand where she's coming from on the rest of it.

She's been a ghost since. I don't really know how to proceed other than going no contact, but I'm not really sure how that will work since she was ""scared"" I almost feel like I should be reassuring her? But I'm also fairly confident she wont respond based on how its all ended/gone so its kind of a double edged sword. I got her a small Christmas present and I'm not sure if I should go drop it off, or wait for her to come around and go from there. Its only an empty picture frame with a sticky note inside it ""For the first of many pictures together.""

I feel like she pressured me to be in a relationship (I want to be, but still it was based on her hints that she'd like us to be official) only to turn around and go cold on me. She's stated her fears a few times on our sleepovers that she thinks I'm/we're too good to be true. Why would she continuously hint at us being in a relationship for it to go this way? 

I don't think I've ever been so genuinely confused. I really like this woman. Any advice on how to handle this?",2,1734980414.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

1hkup6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1hkup6p/one_more_i_passed_the_cissp_exam_post/,"One more ""I passed the CISSP exam"" post ","Since last Saturday, I'm happy to belong to the select group of people that have provisionally passed the CISSP exam! I'm sharing notes around resources, preparation, exam experience, and some tips that I hope will help those brave souls that pursue the cert! 

--- Prior experience: I have around 7 years of experience in GRC and data protection, and have a legal background. I hold certs such as CRISC, CISM and some IAPP ones too. English is not my native language. 

--- Resources used:

- LearnZApp (7/10) - Used it for 3 months or so. As many have mentioned, not close to the real thing but good for revision and focusing on weak areas. I valued the portable aspect of the app. 

- Boson (5/10) - I'd say it's quite similar to the LearnZApp question library. If I'd go through this again, I'd probably skip Boson altogether. 

- Quantum Exams (9/10) - The questions were harder than the exam, and I disagreed with some of the responses or justifications, however QE trains you to filter and evaluate your options carefully, and for that it was invaluable. Props to DarkHelmet for the great work (I'm curious about the CAT implementation, I'm sure it will help a lot)! Note - your score doesn't matter that much. 

- Destination CISSP from Destination Certification (8/10) - A great resource, focusing on key areas, and easy to read. I think it's a great starting point to get one's feet wet regarding the various subjects, and then zooming in further where needed.

- OSG 9th edition (7/10) - There's a lot of info in there! Is it a bit dry and vast? Sure. But you can't deny the quality and depth of the information in there, I feel like I learned a lot by reading it. 

- CISSP Exam Cram by Pete Zerger (9/10) - A great resource, ideal when commuting, doing chores etc. 

- CISSP Mindmaps by Destination Certification (8/10) - The content is similar to the book mentioned above, just in audio format and a bit condensed. Also a great resource. 

- ChatGPT (X/10) - I think ChatGPT can be as useful as you can make it be. I think it's a great resource if you want it to summarize a concept or provide some examples to make them stick better, which is how I used it. I wouldn't use it as my main source of learning, but great as a supplement. 

- YouTube videos (e.g. Computerphile, CBT nuggets etc.) (11/10) - I'm a visual learner, so for me YouTube was a godsend. There's videos about every single topic of the CISSP delivered in a digestible way, probably the best resource out there to drill down on topics (at least for me). 

- 50 CISSP hard questions (8/10) - Good for acquiring the right mindset for some of the questions. The difficulty and style of the questions doesn't match those of the exam 

- Why you will pass the CISSP exam by Kelly Handerhan (6/10) - I appreciate the positivity Kelly brings forward with this one, however I feel like this video is slightly outdated (the whole ""think like a manager"" thing does not apply to the current exam format, for the most part), but good for motivation if that's your thing. 

- This Reddit thread (priceless) - I've been lurking in this thread for some time. People sharing their positive experiences gave me motivation, and highlighted useful elements about the exam, materials, preparation. 

--- Preparation: I have been studying on and off for CISSP for a couple years at this point, but only got serious over the past 4-5 months. I listened to Pete's and mindmap videos whenever I had some time to spare. I read the OSG cover to cover, pinpointed my weakest areas through testing, then used the rest of the resources to either simplify concepts or elaborate on them. I'd mainly watch YT videos and take notes on key info, or ask ChatGPT to explain, summarize, create comparative tables, make funny analogies etc. Then back to testing to check progress, iterating for the last 3 months or so. By the time of the exam, I had read the OSG and the Destination CISSP ebook twice, watched Pete's video at least 5 times (an overkill, perhaps), the mindmap video series twice, gone through 6 QE tests (averaging 50%), and completed 7 Boson tests (averaging 70%).

--- Exam experience: On the day before the exam, I tied some loose ends and had one last QE test to get into the mindset, but tried to relax as much as possible. On the day of the exam, I just focused on being relaxed (I'd only slept for 4 hours the night before, due to stress, so I was relaxed, in a bad way!), and after a small breakfast and a coffee, I headed to the exam center, listening to my favorite music etc. After being photographed, getting my palm scanned and signing all relevant agreements, I sat down and started the exam. I had read the NDA that was sent to me via email, so I scrolled through it and accepted, wasting no time. 

I don't remember much from the first questions, however they seemed relative straightforward and easy, compared to the ones further down the line. My goal was to finish the first 100 questions with at least 60 minutes to spare, in case I'd need to go through an additional 50. I read each question once, then the 4 answers once, and then read the question again. In some cases, I spent 2 mins on a single question, as I wasn't sure about the answer, but I compensated by spending around 20 seconds on a few others where the answer was obvious to me, so my timing balanced out. By question 100, I had 72 minutes left, so my time management was within my MTD üòâ

The CAT is definitely well-designed. During my studies, I remember struggling with SSO and FIM a bit, and prayed that I wouldn't get a lot of questions on SAML, Kerberos etc. Well, either I prayed to the wrong god (less likely) or I'm stupid (more likely) as the CAT is designed to find your weak spots and go after them, and oh boy, it did!! I think I got around 15 questions just on that topic. 

There were a few questions I wasn't sure about, and there were some that made ZERO sense to me. I suspect the last ones were the beta questions, and, to be honest, I told myself this during the exam, and perhaps I relaxed a bit while going through some of them. In any case, I do think that you can spot some of the beta ones with some level of certainty as they didn't seem as refined as the rest. Try to not let your guard down if you do this though, as it can be a dangerous tactic and throw you off. 

When I submitted the response to the 100th question, the exam was terminated. My heart raced slightly, but at that moment, I gave myself a 70% chance that I had passed ,as I was quite confident for the majority of my responses. Turns out I was correct. I got my printout, and went for some well-deserved lunch. 

Looking back, I think the exam was easier than I expected, and I now feel I was perhaps a little over-prepared for it. It wasn't easy, but I never felt I was failing or doing bad. My lack of sleep was my only detriment, but I'm happy it didn't play a role in the long run.

--- Some Tips 

1. Study YOUR way: We all have our way to learn and retain information. Find the way that works best for you, and be consistent. Try different methods and decide which one suit you best, and stick with it. 

2. Prepare, but don't overprepare: This one is hard to measure and quantify, but I think there's a balance between preparing and overdoing it for the exam. Can you read and learn everything mentioned in the OSG? Sure. Is it all going to be useful for the exam? Most likely not. Memorizing key lengths and fence heights will most likely not be needed for the exam. Inch deep, mile wide is the name of the game. 

3. Be consistent, and stay focused: I have been studying for the CISSP for 2 years, and I had already rescheduled it once, and I kind of regret doing this. Set a deadline, work towards it, and go for it. During the exam, stay focused, and focus on the long game. Pick up your pace and keep at it, and don't let a few difficult questions discourage you. 

4. Be physically well-prepared: A healthy mind in a healthy body. Don't neglect sleep, nutrition and hydration. 

5. Just answer the question: Each question gives you all the information you need to respond. Some of them as as straightforward as a definition, others are scenario-based that require critical thinking. Don't assume, read the question and available answers 2 or 3 times, then select the best answer. In my case, usually 2 options were blatantly not relevant or applicable. 

6. If I passed, so can you: I never imagined that I'd come to this point, waiting for my CISSP endorsement to be approved, as someone that studied law and has never configured a network, wrote a single line of code or performed a vulnerability  test. The test is about concepts, a holistic view on cyber security, and a critical way of thinking. If I can do it, so can you. And lastly, 

7. This is just the beginning: Most of the CISSP holders are experts in their respective fields. However, there is always something new to learn. Coming out of this multi-month effort, I'm amazed at how many new things I learned along the way, and I'm excited to see how I can apply this knowledge to my day-to-day practices. Study, grasp the concepts, pass the exam, and use the knowledge to become a better professional! 

I hope the above was useful or at least motivational. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Enjoy the holidays, and be well! ",12,1734980332.0,cissp,7,1.0,False

It's a small wavy silver band with a First Nations design, and the seam is broken. If anyone finds it I'm offering a cash reward of $400 for its safe return‚Äîthe most I could scrape together, and way more than it would sell for.

1hkuj7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hkuj7c/watchers_part_1/,Watchers (Part 1),"""Here we are ‚Äì Dunn‚Äôs Creek!"" Steve shouted as he, Dave, Tommy, and Lara stretched as they climbed out of the car and trudged along the deserted main street. ""The fog is a bit weird, though, especially in the middle of August. But I guess it adds to the vibe."" The houses lining the street to the left and right still appeared as if they hadn‚Äôt been abandoned for too long‚Äîmaybe a few years. One could still sense how beautiful this place must have been once. The red sandstone buildings and the small log cabins with their protruding facades still had a touch of elegance and Western American romance, which in many modern cities had long become a relic of past days or mediocre Western movies. Overall, the town was in a remarkably well-preserved condition; only some boarded-up windows, rusted cars on the streets, and thorny vines and hedges that had crept over the sidewalks into the houses signaled that it had been quite some time since Dunn‚Äôs Creek was filled with life.

""Yeah, sure. Really picturesque here,"" Lara rolled her eyes. She had imagined something else for a relaxing weekend getaway. But Steve loved exploring lost places, just like his two friends Dave and Tommy, so it wasn‚Äôt a big surprise that they had taken a two-hour detour to search this admittedly rather interesting place, instead of heading straight to the lake. Lara, however, felt anything but comfortable in this ghost town. In the last two years, she had often accompanied her boyfriend to such places‚Äîabandoned towns and houses, deserted factories, empty hotels, dilapidated ruins, and crumbling mines. She often felt as though she shouldn‚Äôt be there, as if it were forbidden to visit these old places, or as if something was lurking, watching them the entire time. But perhaps it was exactly that which intrigued her boyfriend about exploring these places. ""Come on,"" Tommy said, ""this place is really cool. Just look at all these buildings. It‚Äôs like there was a thriving little town here just a few months ago.""

The group continued walking along the main street. ""Yeah,"" Lara replied, ""but I still find it creepy. We don‚Äôt even know why the town was abandoned. What if dangerous gases are seeping up from the ground or something? Maybe this isn‚Äôt fog after all."" The fog, the winding alleys, the forest, and the hills surrounding the town, not to mention the completely deserted streets, made Dunn‚Äôs Creek a creepy place, giving Lara a sense of unreality. She wrapped her arms around herself and followed the rest of the group.

""Look at that! Have you ever seen something like this?"" Steve suddenly called out, pointing at the church tower about 50 meters ahead of them. Lara squinted her eyes to see what he meant through the light fog swirling around the tower. ""The bell..."" Steve added. Now Lara saw it too. ""Strange..."" she replied. ""Maybe it‚Äôs broken?"" The bell was moving inside the tower, as though it was ringing, yet there was no sound. ""Oh no, how creepy, something‚Äôs broken in a ghost town!"" Tommy‚Äôs voice was dripping with sarcasm. ""Oh, shut up, you idiot,"" Steve retorted. Dave chuckled.

After a few more minutes of walking along the main street, they rounded a corner and came upon a beautiful two-story sandstone building, with a double-winged entrance leading up to it by a stone staircase. In front of the building was a small park with a once-lovely garden, now certainly overgrown, surrounded by a low, Gothic-style black iron fence. ""The library,"" Lara said, nodding towards the sign in front of the building explaining its function. ""It‚Äôs beautiful!"" She took a few steps backward to get a better look at the building. ""Shit!"" she suddenly screamed, her heart skipping a beat. The others burst into laughter. She had walked backward into a small garden wall she hadn‚Äôt noticed, fallen onto it, and ended up sitting down. To avoid falling backward off the wall, she instinctively stretched her arms out to find something to hold onto. But there was already someone sitting on the wall. At least, that‚Äôs what she thought at first, as her hand landed on the shoulder of a statue someone had placed there.

""Fuck!"" she shouted. ""I almost had a heart attack! Who would put a damn statue on a garden wall?"" As the others laughed, Lara looked more closely at the statue. Had she not been so startled, she might have been impressed by the level of detail. Whoever had crafted the lifelike bust was a master of their craft. The folds in the fabric, the individual hairs, the look of the man as he nervously glanced over his shoulder. The artist had painted the statue, and the paint still looked fresh, as though it had just dried, despite all the time it had been exposed to the elements. In another context, Lara, an art enthusiast and amateur painter, might have appreciated the statue, but here in Dunn‚Äôs Creek, it seemed creepy. ""Can we please just go? I hate this place!"" she asked, clearly annoyed. ""Are you crazy?"" Steve replied. ""I was just about to suggest we check if the library‚Äôs locked. I wonder if there‚Äôs anything interesting inside."" ""You‚Äôre joking‚Ä¶"" But the rest of the group enthusiastically agreed with Steve, so Lara resigned herself with a sigh. ""Fine, but hurry up. I want to get to the lake already.""

The friends walked through the small park in front of the library and up the sandstone steps. When they reached the door, they immediately noticed that it wasn‚Äôt locked‚Äîit was slightly ajar. ""Well, would you look at that!"" Dave exclaimed as he entered first. Lara shook her head, knowing there was no point in resisting. So, she followed Dave inside. The interior of the library was just as impressive as its exterior. High ceilings, rows upon rows of bookshelves, all filled with books. The ground floor had no ceiling; instead, the upper floor formed a ring around the central hall, supported by Corinthian-style sandstone columns. The floor was made of dark wood, and the room was flooded with light from the enormous windows, the sunbeams cutting through the dust particles swirling in the air. At night, the library was illuminated by three small chandeliers, which were now draped with cobwebs, symbolizing the time the building had stood empty. Tommy whistled in awe. ""I guess we could spend hours exploring here!"" ""Not a chance!"" Lara hissed. But even she couldn‚Äôt deny that the building was beautiful and she would have liked to browse around. It was just that the huge space radiated an eerie atmosphere, much like the rest of the small town.

After a few minutes of wandering, Dave‚Äôs voice echoed from the far end of the library. ""Come here! I think I found something!"" The rest of the group joined him. He was standing in front of a dark wooden desk, on which the remnants of an almost-burnt candle rested. Empty cans and water bottles were scattered around, along with a stained mattress and dozens of books piled up beside it. Dave held out a kind of leather folder to them. Lara read the inscription: ""To the one who finds this manuscript.""

""What‚Äôs this?"" Steve asked. ""Can‚Äôt you read? It‚Äôs a manuscript, you idiot,"" Tommy said. ""I can see that, but what‚Äôs it supposed to say?"" ""Maybe it explains what happened to Dunn‚Äôs Creek?"" Lara suggested. ""I think someone would have found it by now, don‚Äôt you?"" Dave replied. ""I guess the only way to find out is by reading it,"" Steve said finally. ""Give it here!""

He grabbed the manuscript from Dave‚Äôs hand and opened the folder. ""Shit, someone really put a lot of effort into this. Look at this! Pictures of the houses and people here, newspaper clippings, and‚Äîwhat‚Äôs this?"" He furrowed his brow. ""A diary?""

""Come on, read it aloud!"" Tommy urged. ""Can we just go already?"" Lara once again expressed her frustration. ""Never, not before we find out what‚Äôs written in the mysterious manuscript in the eerie, abandoned library of the mysterious ghost town,"" Dave said, adopting a mysterious voice, holding his flashlight under his chin.

""Come on, Lara, we‚Äôll read it quickly and then leave, promise!"" Steve said. Lara sighed. She looked into her boyfriend‚Äôs eyes and saw how much fun he was having exploring this abandoned building and now holding this presumably historic and equally mysterious document. She sighed and gave in. ""Alright, but hurry up."" ""You‚Äôre the best!"" Steve beamed at her, kissed her, cleared his throat, and began reading:

**September 19**

Dunn's Creek was once a really nice little town located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The location of our small town, surrounded by hills to the north, east, and west, and situated on the banks of the river that gave the town its name, Dunn Creek, used to provide the atmosphere of a perfect small-town idyll. No matter where you looked, the views of the surrounding hills and the pine forests that climb the Rockies ensured that you never grew tired of the scenery, even after decades of seeing it. I‚Äôve experienced a lot here, even though the town is quite far from other settlements and not much exciting happens here. I was born here, took my first steps, spoke my first words here. I spent my school years here and worked as a librarian for 20 years. I made many friends here, and even got married. My parents were born and died in Dunn‚Äôs Creek, as did many other good people. This is home to me. And now, I know I will die here. How exactly, I don‚Äôt know. No one knew when it was time. In the past few months, our cozy little community has turned into a place of fear and suffering, and now, I am the last one still alive here. Since all electronic devices have become useless due to recent events, I decided to leave a message for anyone who will one day visit Dunn‚Äôs Creek and wonder why and how a town like this could fall apart. To whoever finds this manuscript, I have attached my diary entries that describe everything that happened, what I know, and also what I don‚Äôt know.

The end of the town began in February with the first strange occurrences described in my diary. At that time, no one knew that everything would go downhill, because everything seemed as it always had.

For example, there was Eliot Mercer, the stocky owner of the grocery store. He had recently made it his mission to chase away three 17-year-old friends, Danny Wilkow, Randy Marshall, and Stanley Wittaker, from his store, because they had recently made it a habit to steal a few cans of beer when no one was looking, which they would then drink on the hills surrounding Dunn‚Äôs Creek. However, Eliot‚Äôs wife, Linda Mercer, always told him not to get so worked up, as she clearly remembered how he was at that age and advised him to let Sheriff Caldwell handle the matter. But Eliot, who had known the three boys since they were little, didn‚Äôt really want to get them into trouble. He was a hot-tempered man but of fundamentally good nature.

Clara Davenport, the teacher, was a warm-hearted woman who was adored by her students because of her knowledge and understanding manner. Even though she was almost 60 by now, she still went to school every morning with as much energy as ever. Ralph, the eight-year-old son of Martha and Lucas Finnigan, particularly liked Miss Davenport and would often talk to her, which she found highly amusing because of his admiration and imagination.

Aaron and Joanne Blake didn‚Äôt have much work during the winter, but their work as farmers in the quiet town was always highly appreciated. I liked them both very much. They were my neighbors, and Aaron went to school with me and was also my best friend. We met at least once a week at Joe Harrington‚Äôs bar, where we played pool and drank a few beers. Joanne was also good friends with my wife before she passed away eight years ago. We talked a lot about her afterward, and I think Joanne was almost as sad about her death as I was.

As usual, you could find Sylvia Klein jogging with Mayor Ruth McAllister every weekend, a tradition they had maintained for years and did every Sunday morning without fail. But this February, which was particularly cold and snowy, Sylvia had caught pneumonia, which the town doctor, Peter O'Donnell, treated. His wife, Evelyn, was the pharmacist and very good friends with Sylvia. So, she secretly slipped Sylvia a little bottle of gin to help her recovery.

Howard Granger, the grumpy owner of the rarely visited gas station, usually sat in a rocking chair in front of his shop, either dozing, drinking beer, or grumpily barking at people who dared to stop at his station to fuel up. I don‚Äôt remember anyone really liking Howard, not even his wife, Hannah. Only John Harper would occasionally be seen talking to the bearded old man, but that was probably because John drank as much as Howard did, and thus they were kindred spirits. Unfortunately, this was at the expense of John‚Äôs 16-year-old daughter, Maggie, who had problems with her father‚Äôs drinking and would often join Danny Wilkow, Randy Marshall, and Stanley Wittaker‚Äôs group out of loneliness and boredom, since they were about the same age.

Pastor Whitfield was one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met. After my wife passed, he gave me much support and invited me to his home for meals so I wouldn‚Äôt be so lonely. His sermons at church were well thought out and delivered, with a tendency towards optimism and the cooperation of all Dunn‚Äôs Creek residents. And the people lived according to his sermons.

Until February, when the events began that destroyed everything. I am writing this at the desk in the library, where I‚Äôve worked for over 20 years and haven‚Äôt left in the past few weeks. I know what the recent signs mean. The end has come for me. In less than two hours, I will be dead, assuming my assumption about what will happen to me is correct. But whoever reads these lines should form their own opinion about what we‚Äôve experienced and make their own judgment. The reports, which I have shortened by a few irrelevant lines and entries, will be hard to believe, but they are true. I‚Äôve attached the pages with the most important events, starting with my diary entry from February 12 of this year.

**February 12**

Today, Walt Grady came into the library. I‚Äôm relieved that the old man has recovered so well, as I thought he was done for. But he seemed pretty lively, although the cold was bothering him. He borrowed a book about the history of Ancient Rome, a topic he can‚Äôt stop talking about. I think he had a discussion with Nate Klein. The two always argue about something. Walt didn‚Äôt seem quite right, though, because he told me he saw a man on the northern hill of Dunn‚Äôs Creek, past Howard‚Äôs gas station, who just disappeared. I think his medication isn‚Äôt properly adjusted; he gave me a generally confused impression, and such hallucinations might indicate a wrong dosage. Maybe I should tell Dr. O‚ÄôDonnell, in case Walt gets sick again.

**February 18**

Lucas Finnigan brought me the mail today. He told me that his kids, Ralph and Emily, had been keeping their mother busy, as they wanted to play in the snow all day. Ralph apparently can‚Äôt stop talking about Miss Davenport, who seems to have taken a liking to him as well. I think it‚Äôs because Ralph has such a big imagination, which Miss Davenport finds amusing. He also recently told me that he now has a second teacher, but no one else seems to know him.

**February 20**

Unfortunately, Walt seems to have gotten worse on his walk to the library last week, as his wife Jessica brought me the book back today. I asked about Walt, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be going well for him‚Äîhis pneumonia seems to have come back. He also seems to be getting a bit paranoid, complaining that he feels watched all the time. It‚Äôs sad to see a good old man like Walt so sick. I told Linda to talk to Dr. O‚ÄôConnell about Walt‚Äôs medication dosage.

**March 2**

It seems even Walt‚Äôs best friend, Nate, is having trouble talking to him. Walt keeps confusing him with someone he‚Äôs terrified of. It‚Äôs very uncharacteristic of him, considering he used to hunt alone in the mountains for weeks and could always defend himself. The fact that he‚Äôs now having panic attacks every time he looks out the window isn‚Äôt helping the situation. Walt‚Äôs medication seems to be properly dosed. It must be hard for Nate to watch what‚Äôs happening to his friend. I can‚Äôt even imagine how it would feel if Aaron were to yell at me in confusion and fear. After all, I‚Äôve known him for over 40 years.

**March 12**

I‚Äôve been feeling a bit off lately whenever I go outside. A little worried. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs anything specific that‚Äôs bothering me, but I have this feeling like I should be looking over my shoulder more often, only to find no one behind me. But it‚Äôs been a long, hard winter, and people‚Äôs moods have generally been worse. The darkness doesn‚Äôt help either. The light fog that has been hanging over the town since Saturday isn‚Äôt making things better. It‚Äôs time for spring. The sun will lift our spirits.

**March 13**

Walt Grady has passed away. Helen Roscoe told me this morning when I walked past her hotel. It hit me hard, because I liked the old man and had hoped he‚Äôd recover and share his vast knowledge of history with me. But I guess it‚Äôs for the best‚Äîhe had been getting weaker in recent months. Jessica will be devastated. According to Helen, Walt fought and screamed as it neared the end. He seemed to have been terrified. I hope he finds peace now.

**March 14**

Eliot Mercer yelled at Danny Wilkow and his two friends in the middle of the street today. They seemed to have broken a window of his store, but they claimed it wasn‚Äôt them. It was quite a heated situation, and Linda had a hard time calming her angry husband and getting him back into the store. Admittedly, the three boys had been acting up for a while. But I don‚Äôt think they would intentionally damage property. After all, Eliot had always given them candy when he saw them on their way back from school. I don‚Äôt know why the three would want to harm him, as they‚Äôre good boys, despite their rebellious phase. I don‚Äôt understand why Eliot‚Äôs dog, Rowdy, didn‚Äôt bark when someone was messing around his store‚Ä¶

**March 17**

John Harper and Howard Granger, our two town drunks, celebrated St. Patrick‚Äôs Day in full force. By celebrated, I mean they were loudly and obviously drunk, shouting at each other in front of Howard‚Äôs gas station, which turned into quite a spectacle that drew a small, curious crowd. The people, myself included, watched the argument and the altercation with a mixture of embarrassment and amusement, but I found it rather sad how far the two of them had fallen. I only half understood what it was about. John accused Howard of stalking his daughter Maggie. I don‚Äôt know why he suspected Howard, but apparently, Maggie really is afraid to go outside. According to John, she feels like she‚Äôs being watched ever since she and Danny Wilkow‚Äôs gang came back from one of the hills, where they had been drinking beer. Maggie claims she saw someone standing in the fog and since then, she‚Äôs felt watched.

I have to admit, I‚Äôve been feeling uneasy more and more lately. I‚Äôm not sure where it‚Äôs coming from, but I‚Äôm definitely not going to start a scene in public. \[...\]

**March 20**

My unease is slowly growing. I can‚Äôt help but constantly glance over my shoulder. As I was walking home after work today, I thought I saw someone standing on the hill behind the Randall farm. It was already dusk, so I‚Äôm not sure if I just imagined it, and the persistent fog might have contributed. But anyway, I thought I saw someone standing there, but when I looked more closely, the silhouette was gone. I remember that Walt, before he died, had told me he had seen someone on one of the hills. Maybe I should ask Dr. O‚ÄôConnell if he‚Äôs setting my medication correctly. Of course, he would first have to prescribe me something.

**March 25**

Something strange happened today. I‚Äôm actually at a loss for words to explain it properly, and it sounds ridiculous when you talk about it. It‚Äôs about Maggie Harper. She had been feeling unwell and followed. Since her father John had publicly accused the gas station attendant, her paranoia had only worsened. In recent days, she had hardly been seen outside, yet she still felt watched, as John explained to us. This afternoon, I heard excited voices in front of the library. I opened the window and looked out onto the street, and saw Maggie accompanied by Danny, Stanley, and Randy. Maggie was obviously upset and disturbed, and the three boys were discussing and gesturing animatedly. When I asked if everything was okay, they called me downstairs because it was ‚Äúhard to explain.‚Äù When I got downstairs, I asked Maggie what was wrong. She had her hands pressed to her eyes, clearly frightened, and with a trembling voice, she managed to say just two words: ‚ÄúMy shadow!‚Äù

At first, I didn‚Äôt know what she meant. The sun was already quite low at that time, and I looked behind me. My body cast a long shadow, just like the boys did. But when I counted again, I froze. There were only four shadows, but we were five people. Maggie‚Äôs shadow was missing! I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible, but it doesn‚Äôt seem right.

Maggie noticed I was speechless, and it clearly terrified her even more. She mentioned something about the man on the hill taking her shadow, and now it was her turn, and she ran quickly home.

**March 28**

\[‚Ä¶\] Maggie has been sick for days, according to John. She saw another silhouette on the hills, this time even two. The poor girl is completely done for, and her shadow still hasn‚Äôt returned. \[‚Ä¶\] Yesterday, Aaron told me that all his clocks in the house stopped at exactly 2:17 AM. He and Joanne are a bit confused about it. Not just one, but all of them! I‚Äôm starting to get confused too. It‚Äôs been a strange few weeks.

**April 2**

Martin Harlow, our mechanic, was a little strange today too. He‚Äôs usually a cheerful, funny person and always ready for a joke. When I ran into him, he seemed worried, glancing at the northern hill of Dunn‚Äôs Creek repeatedly during our small talk. He looked like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days. When I asked if everything was okay, he just stared at me with a strange expression and walked off without saying another word. \[‚Ä¶\]

**April 19**

\[‚Ä¶\] Something is wrong here. The fog just won‚Äôt go away. More and more people are reporting one or two silhouettes in the fog on the hills. Tina Klein saw them yesterday, and George Larkin saw them today. The strange thing is, they don‚Äôt seem to do anything. If they‚Äôre strangers who‚Äôve gotten lost and need help, why don‚Äôt they just come into the town and talk to someone? They just stand there in the fog, staring at people. If I hadn‚Äôt seen one of these silhouettes myself a few weeks ago, I‚Äôd be highly skeptical. And still, no one has been able to swear that someone was really standing there, because when you look closely, there‚Äôs no one.

Maggie obviously doesn‚Äôt speak anymore. She just sits by the window, staring out toward the hills, refusing meals. John had an argument with Danny, who apparently wanted to visit her. Maggie and the boy seem to have some sort of relationship, which John disapproves of. He told Danny that Maggie absolutely couldn‚Äôt have visitors, she was far too upset. \[‚Ä¶\]

**April 25**

Apparently, Jacob Miller‚Äôs cats have disappeared. Without a trace. All four of them. How can that happen? He lives next to the cemetery, of course, he‚Äôs the undertaker. But how likely is it that four animals would fall into open graves, as he assumes? Especially since there are no open graves, as no one has died. He reported seeing one of the figures in the fog between the gravestones the day before the cats disappeared. Who are these figures, and why don‚Äôt they show themselves? \[‚Ä¶\]

**April 29**

Maggie is gone! She wasn‚Äôt in her bed when John woke up this morning. He called Danny Wilkow, but he claimed he hadn‚Äôt seen Maggie in a week because John wouldn‚Äôt let him visit her. John stormed straight to Howard Granger‚Äôs gas station to confront him. Of course, Howard also claimed he hadn‚Äôt seen Maggie, but John wasn‚Äôt having it. When the situation started escalating, Sheriff Caldwell fortunately showed up to defuse the conflict. He took both John and Howard with him, and they‚Äôre now both at his station answering his questions. \[‚Ä¶\]

Postscript: I could swear I saw one of the silhouettes in the dark, standing behind the Blake‚Äôs farm, at the end of the field! So close to my house!

**May 3**

What‚Äôs going on here? I think we‚Äôre all losing our minds. In search of Maggie, various search teams have gone out to comb the area around the town. Lucas Finnigan, George Larkin, Marc Davenport, and Helen Roscoe planned to search the woods west of Dunn‚Äôs Creek. They drove down the road in George‚Äôs pickup truck, past the McLeods‚Äô tailor shop. Behind the tailor shop, at the edge of town, they turned right onto the gravel road that leads to the water tower. But the road wasn‚Äôt there anymore! It was just gone. And I don‚Äôt mean that someone had removed the gravel and put in new soil. The road was gone, and grass and hedges had grown where it had been yesterday. Like it had never existed. Instead, a new path now led left, behind Garry Oak‚Äôs house, which was definitely not there before. Even Garry‚Äôs cherry tree was gone. I‚Äôm honestly not sure what to think anymore. \[‚Ä¶\]

I think after today, everyone in Dunn‚Äôs Creek realizes something‚Äôs wrong. People are tense. Maggie is still gone, and some feel it has something to do with one of the silhouettes. \[‚Ä¶\]

Aaron and Joanne were very quiet today. Of course, I told them I thought I saw one of the figures behind their field. They just nodded silently.

**May 9**

We‚Äôve given up searching for Maggie. We‚Äôve combed every place, but found no trace. John has been drinking more in the past few days and barely says anything anymore. The poor man has already been through enough in his life, and now his only child and last remaining family member has disappeared...

**May 12**

Since today, neither phones, televisions, radios, nor any other communication devices are working anymore. We are cut off from the outside world! We believe the figures have something to do with it, even though no one has ever seen them do anything other than stand and observe. People are seeing them more often now, often out of the corner of their eyes or in their peripheral vision. As soon as you look closer, they‚Äôre gone. They‚Äôve also never been seen within the city limits, only on the hills and behind the Blake‚Äôs farm. There, they just stand, half-hidden in the fog.

We‚Äôve planned a meeting at town hall tonight to discuss what to do next. I hope we can figure out how to get our old life back because right now, everyone is getting a little restless.

**May 13**

The meeting yesterday didn‚Äôt give us much except that we now have a better idea of the extent of what‚Äôs happening. Dozens of citizens, including the Finnigans and their children, the Harlows, old Nate Klein, Jessica Grady, Mayor McAllister, CJ Jameson, Mandy Glover, myself, and many others, have seen the figures in the last few weeks. Oddities like the disappearance of the road to the water tower were not isolated incidents. Just like with my neighbors, the Blakes, other households also had their clocks stop ‚Äì all at 2:17. Leona Holt‚Äôs shadow disappeared just like Maggie Harper‚Äôs, as her students had shockingly noticed during the lunch break. Several animals, mostly cats and livestock from the two ranches, have simply disappeared without a trace, some from locked barns. Emory Knox, while working as an electrician at the Kirkland‚Äôs house, apparently had some sort of seizure a couple of days ago. The Kirklands said he stood motionless for exactly 17 minutes. Not a hair moved, not even a blink or breath. Emory was frozen in mid-sentence, mid-motion, and exactly 17 minutes later, thawed and finished his sentence as if nothing had happened. He has no memory of it.

Ralph and Emily Finnigan have been staring out the window toward the hills since yesterday, acting unusually quiet and apathetic. Lucas and Martha are scared for their children. When I think of how Maggie was before her disappearance, I would be scared too if I were in their shoes. \[‚Ä¶\]

Sam Barrows, who owns the fishing store near the school, has been talking a lot about conspiracies and government experiments. But no one really believes him, because nothing can be explained that way. \[‚Ä¶\]

Most of us now believe that the figures on the hills aren‚Äôt strangers looking for help. What (or rather, who) they are, no one can explain. It‚Äôs hard for me to believe that there are creatures out there that aren‚Äôt human, but no amount of thinking has provided any insight into what we‚Äôre dealing with. Despite the lingering skepticism of some citizens, we‚Äôve concluded that we have to do something. But no one really knows what, because we don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs happening...

**May 23**

\[‚Ä¶\] Ralph and Emily Finnigan haven‚Äôt stopped staring out the window, which is scaring their parents. Last night, they packed their things and left early this morning. They planned to head toward Washington to seek help and get their children to safety. I can‚Äôt blame them. This morning at 7 AM, I saw them leave as I was on my way to the library. They drove west, past the tailor‚Äôs shop and the now non-existent path.

What happened next makes me doubt whether we can change anything about the situation. Around 6 PM, the Finnigans were seen returning to Dunn‚Äôs Creek, coming from the east. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible to drive west and then hours later come back from the opposite direction to the starting point. What makes it even stranger is what Lucas told me when I asked what had happened. They had driven normally along the road without turning. When leaving the town, Martha had seen two figures on the hills, so the Finnigans had stepped on the gas to get away from Dunn‚Äôs Creek as quickly as possible. But after 45 minutes, they simply drove back into the town from the opposite direction. After 45 minutes! This means, according to their account, that they must have re-entered the town by no later than 8 AM. But they were only seen again just after 6 PM! Ten hours later!

What happened during those ten hours, neither Lucas nor Martha could explain. Just like they couldn‚Äôt explain how they made it back to Dunn‚Äôs Creek. \[‚Ä¶\]

**May 30**

Now the Finnigans have all disappeared. Lucas, Martha, Emily, and Ralph. No sign of where they went. Since Lucas was the mailman and no one received their mail that morning, their disappearance was noticed quite quickly. But that doesn‚Äôt make it any less strange. Laura Harlow, Martha‚Äôs best friend, knocked on the door of the Finnigans‚Äô house, but received no answer. She went to the back door and looked inside. What she saw didn‚Äôt make any sense, so she called Sheriff Caldwell for help, who gained access to the house.

All the beds were empty. The fridge was open. The water in the bathroom was running. A half-eaten toast sat on a plate, and milk was standing open beside a cup of coffee, which hadn‚Äôt been poured into it yet. All in all, it seemed like the Finnigans had vanished into thin air. At first, I thought maybe they had gone out of town again and made it this time. But their car was still in the driveway. No one saw them leave, not the Jacksons across the street nor Miss Miller, who always spies out the windows and never misses anything. Since no one saw them leave, we assume they were somehow abducted. We‚Äôve formed search teams again to find the family. I‚Äôll start searching in the northern part of town with Aaron and the pastor. The thought of going into the hills, where we often see the figures, doesn‚Äôt sit well with me, but we may have no choice. The Finnigans would do the same for us. \[‚Ä¶\]

I‚Äôve started looking for literature in the library that might shed light on what‚Äôs happening here. So far, I haven‚Äôt found anything that matches the description of the silhouettes. But no one has really seen the beings to this day. They remain hidden in the peripheral field of vision, so you can‚Äôt look at them directly. They are almost like the fog in which they hide. I feel like they want us to know they‚Äôre there. But what their presence means, I can‚Äôt imagine.

**June 4**

No trace of the Finnigans. We‚Äôve stopped searching again. Now five people are gone, including three children. People are slowly becoming suspicious and hardly leave their homes anymore. Rowdy, the Mercers‚Äô dog, has now also disappeared. No trace, of course.

Clara Davenport claims to have seen one of the figures in the fog on the school roof. This would be the first time they‚Äôve dared to come within the city limits. Miss Holt‚Äôs shadow still hasn‚Äôt returned. She has locked herself in her apartment for days and won‚Äôt open the door for anyone. When Eliot Mercer pressed his face against the window and peeked through a gap in the curtains into the Holts‚Äô living room, he saw Miss Holt frantically scribbling and drawing symbols on the walls, although he couldn‚Äôt identify the symbols and writings.

My paranoia is getting worse too. Although I‚Äôve only seen the figures a few times (Dave Calloway sees them almost every day now), I barely dare to walk home from the library alone. I pray every time I go outside that I still have a shadow.

**June 7**

They‚Äôve taken Miss Holt. She has vanished without a trace. She was last seen by her students when she went into her office just before class began, but she never appeared again. Sheriff Caldwell gained access to her house and found almost every wall and ceiling smeared with strange symbols and markings. No one can say exactly what Miss Holt wrote. But I have a bad feeling that it might be a warning or something like that. \[‚Ä¶\]

Aaron told me earlier that Joanne no longer dares to look out the window. The fog is getting thicker, and she feels the two figures are standing there watching her. That thought sends a chill down my spine. I asked Aaron if we should sleep in one house together to keep each other company, but he didn‚Äôt seem too happy about the suggestion. \[‚Ä¶\]

Postscript: George Larkin hasn‚Äôt returned to his wife today, and no one has found him yet. That‚Äôs two people in one day who‚Äôve disappeared without a trace, at least if I‚Äôm right in assuming that what happened to him is the same as what happened to Miss Holt and the others (which I believe). I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. I‚Äôve heard that CJ Jameson, Dave Calloway, and Martin Harlow plan to go out tomorrow and confront the figures on the hills. Of course, there have been some protests and discussions, but I think everyone realizes that we have to act if we want the situation to turn around. I pray the three of them return safely.

**June 8**

They didn‚Äôt return. Of course, they didn‚Äôt. Three men, just gone. We found their rifles at the foot of the northern hill, lined up against an old, crumbling wall of the adjacent cemetery. Next to them lay their clothes and shoes, neatly folded on the ground. There‚Äôs no trace of the three men. The figures watched us as we gathered CJ‚Äôs, Marc‚Äôs, and Dave‚Äôs belongings to return to their families. Searching is pointless. We won‚Äôt find them anyway. \[‚Ä¶\]

1hkui2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exvangelical/comments/1hkui2q/religious_ocdscrupulosity_and_baptism/,Religious OCD/Scrupulosity and Baptism,"I was raised in a denomination that taught baptism was necessary for the remission of sins. It was their primary focus (some of you already know what denomination I'm from by that sentence). They took it a step further than just saying that baptism was necessary--they said you had to be baptized the right way, believing the right doctrine in order for it to have any salvific value.     

For instance, if I believed I was only performing an outward sign of an inward grace, that it wasn't for the purpose of salvation--then I would need to be baptized again in order to find salvation, understanding that the water was where my sins were actually forgiven by Jesus. Yes, they believe they're the only denomination going to heaven, and one of the reasons is this.       

I have struggled with mental illness for most of my life, and not long after I first became a Christian, I went at it hard. I became highly scrupulous about the most minute things. Even one ""curse word"" in a movie? I would be damned for watching it if I didn't repent and make certain that only G-rated flicks were before my eyes (and even some of those G-rated ones were questionable, with the philosophies taught within them). Late to church? A sin that I must repent of in order to find God's grace. Drinking coffee, which is technically an addictive drug? Enough to earn me eternal conscious torment.       

I found myself doubting my baptism several times because of this church's teachings. I was baptized a second time, because I was afraid that perhaps some part of my body (say, my pinkie finger) didn't go all the way under the first time (baptism is a total burial--Romans 6:3-6). I was baptized a third time because I thought about how I hadn't repented of at least one of my sins before having it done the last time (repentance must precede baptism--Acts 2:38). I was baptized a fourth time for the same reason as the third time. And then I was baptized a fifth time for reasons I won't get into here, lol.    

The legalism of my church did untold damage to my psyche. This kind of thinking makes God into a genuine monster--someone who would torture you forever just because a pinkie remained above the water when you were trying to obey His command to be baptized. Evangelicalism alone will scar you and traumatize you; evangelical legalism will turn you into a totally different kind of freak, however. 

It took a lot of years and a lot of time being away from the church for my faith to transform into something beautiful. I lost my faith entirely more than once along the way, but eventually, I came to embrace an image of God that's much more concerned with how we're loving one another than whether or not we're getting some doctrine wrong along the way. Belief that baptism is for the remission of sins is one of the things I've retained from my upbringing in my denomination, but I also don't think God's going to damn anyone for not perfectly understanding some biblical concept.

I no longer think the Bible is inerrant, I don't think eternal conscious torment is the best way to understand the concept of hell (although sometimes I really wish it was because of murderous scumbags like all of the presidents who have ever ruled America), and I personally think the nature of Jesus, who called off an execution mandated by ""God's law"" in the case of the woman caught in adultery, should be what most informs me as to what God is actually like.      

I am proud of the fact that my beliefs are placed in a healthy system now. I don't know of any church that I'd fit in with too well, but I'm not as concerned with that. It took me a very long time to get here. Legalism combined with scrupulosity turned me into a genuine freak. If you've ever had any experiences like this because of your evangelical upbringing, I'd love to hear about it. ",7,1734979786.0,Exvangelical,8,1.0,False

1hkugvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1hkugvs/finding_reliable_wifi_while_traveling_tips_for/,Finding Reliable WiFi While Traveling: Tips for Digital Nomads,"Hey fellow wanderlust warriors! üåç‚úàÔ∏è

As someone whose laptop is practically an extension of my arm, finding reliable WiFi has been the holy grail of my global escapades. Whether you're a digital nomad or just a traveler with a serious Netflix addiction, I‚Äôve got some tips and tales from my journeys through 50 countries that might just save you from the dreaded buffering icon. üòÖüì∂

**1. Coffee Shops: Your Best Friend ‚òïÔ∏è**

In most cities, coffee shops aren‚Äôt just a caffeine fix‚Äîthey're also an oasis for digital nomads. From a cozy caf√© in Kyoto to trendy spots in Cape Town, I've found that local coffee joints are reliable for free WiFi. The secret? Choose those that look popular with locals for a better chance of faster speeds. My personal tip: purchase a small item out of courtesy, and you might find the barista a lot more willing to help if the connection falters.

**2. Libraries: A Hidden Gem üìö**

I‚Äôve stumbled upon some incredible libraries during my travels, often lured in by the scent of books and the promise of quiet corners. From the grandeur of the New York Public Library to the minimalist beauty of Stockholm‚Äôs library, these spaces often boast excellent WiFi. Plus, they‚Äôre a fantastic place to dive into a bit of local culture.

**3. Co-working Spaces: Worth the Investment üíº**

Sure, co-working spaces can be a bit pricier, but if you‚Äôre planning an extended stay, it might be worth the splurge for consistent and fast internet. Cities like Bali, Berlin, and Barcelona have wonderful community-oriented spaces. I‚Äôve often found myself striking up conversations that led to great local tips!

**4. Local SIM Cards: A Game Changer üì±**

One of the smartest investments I‚Äôve made is getting a local SIM card with a data plan. Not only does it allow for tethering (hello, WiFi hotspot), but it's often cheaper than splurging on overpriced international roaming plans. Plus, it‚Äôs a great way to stay connected while out and about without scouring for WiFi.

**5. Offline Isn‚Äôt So Bad üåê‚ùå**

I‚Äôve learned to embrace offline moments. Download articles, books, or maps using offline apps, and give in to the joy of not always being connected. Some of my favorite experiences have come when I least expected to find WiFi and instead found a new friend or stumbled upon a hidden gem.

1hkufpv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hkufpv,"Review of Melia Casa Maya, Cancun ","Hi all, I‚Äôm currently staying at this hotel and know a lot of people have booked and are hoping to see more details. Here is my review of the first few days, with some photos. 

For some context, the Casa Maya hotel has been around for many years, and was partly used as a timeshare. Melia Hotels recently bought the property and this past summer they closed it down for renovations. They just reopened on Dec 16.

THE GOOD:
* The decor and interior design is beautiful and well thought out. Really swanky feel, and they seamlessly make it kid friendly with a pool table and foosball tables in the lobby/bar area. 
* Bed linens are quality. Towels are XL towels which is cozy. 
* The pool is really nice (water is cold) and since I‚Äôve been here there has been no problem at all finding deck chairs by the pool or on the beach. I‚Äôve even been able to get a cabana (free for all - no additional payment for these), and there are umbrellas around most deck chairs. 
* The food is ok, not the best not the worst. You‚Äôll find things that are good and things that are bland. 
* The hotel workers are really nice and most are apologetic about certain inconveniences since the hotel has just opened and there are several kinks that need straightening out. 
* They have activities on the beach and in/by the pool. Like table tennis, early morning stretching/yoga, beach soccer, volleyball, bingo, salsa. I haven‚Äôt seen pool aerobics yet, but it is on the activities sheet. 
* I dont have kids but have seen a kids coach playing games with kids in the pool. Apparently the water park opened yesterday. I haven‚Äôt checked it out yet.  
* The nightly entertainment is great - Mexican dancers, fun singers, and there are plans for more shows. There is no ‚Äòdedicated‚Äô space for shows. These are in the lobby area by the bar which is pretty small and intimate. Some seating in different areas and standing room. You won‚Äôt get a good view if you‚Äôre sitting in certain areas. Shows start at 8pm till about 930pm. And then there is a DJ with light music. 

THE BAD:
* A lot of kinks to straighten out, and a lot of the workers don‚Äôt have all the information. 
* There are only 4 restaurants (one buffet, one grill walk-up bar, one Italian restaurant, one international seafood restaurant), and hours are not consistent.
* For the two menu-based restaurants, one of them was open when we first arrived but they told us we needed reservations (which was wrong) so they turned us away. Since then, this restaurant has been closed for two days so we haven‚Äôt had a chance to try dinner there. The Italian restaurant is reservation only, which you have to do at the lobby every morning. If you reserve for a later reservation, there will be several things on the menu that run out. If you miss your reservation, you will have to wait until later in the evening to do a walk-in because they are short staffed right now. 
* The buffet doesn‚Äôt have names for the food items 
* The espresso machine at the bar looks like it‚Äôs just for show right now, if you ask for coffee/lattes at the bar, they will go to the back room and bring it to you from there. They don‚Äôt have any specialty coffees. Just the basics.
* They don‚Äôt have flavored syrups or different kinds of teas even though they are shown on the menu on the app. The menus show several milk opens but they only have 3 (soy, almond, whole).
* There are some drinks they don‚Äôt know how to make or don‚Äôt have the ingredients to make. 
* The cocktails are all BAD, at every establishment, even if you have the premium liquor through The Level (although you have to tell them over and over because otherwise they will give you house liquor). You‚Äôre better off getting wine or champagne or canned/bottled beer. 
* Since they are still honoring the timeshare folks, the beach doesn‚Äôt feel exclusive and you‚Äôll see people on the beach with tents and their own umbrellas, so that breaks up the aesthetics a little. 
* There are cabanas on the beach that are out of use/taped off with caution tape. There is also a very old and dilapidated children‚Äôs play thing on the beach that is taped off with caution tape. An eye sore! 
* The WiFi gets spotty/pretty much cuts off at the beach. 
* The app is not super functional. You can‚Äôt request items on there (like needs for the room, room service, or maintenance), and the phone lines are down too. The activities and nightly shows are on the app and after a few days seems to be consistent. 

THE UGLY:
* DO NOT PURCHASE THE LEVEL. It is entirely not worth it at the moment and they were not forthcoming with what would be available. We are basically paying extra for absolutely nothing. 
* The private Level lounge is not ready yet. 
* The private Level beach is not available (the beach is a free for all. You can generally find a deck chair but only one area has umbrellas. The sun is not too hot though and there is a breeze. I have tanned skin so that is not a problem for me)
* Not all The Level rooms look like what is shown on the website. 
* We booked The Level Suite for 4 people and when we got to our room there was one king bed. This suite generally looked like the photos, just a few unfinished things. After some major back and forth about where the 4 of us would sleep, we were put into a lower level room with 2 beds for one night until we could get back into the appropriate suite. We moved to the new suite the next day and this one looked Iike they quickly just threw things together. No balcony furniture, only two single chairs in a huge living room for 4 people. Ugly headboards. Shower amenities with no pumps. We asked about getting a couch to sit on since we would be in the room for 7 days, and they brought us an extra bed in place of a couch. 
* They gave us the wrong wrist bands when we checked in. We didn‚Äôt get The Level wrist bands until a bartender tried to charge us for premium liquor and we had to go back and get the right wrist bands. There have been times we have asked if our drinks were made with premium liquor (while we‚Äôve had the level wrist bands on) and they have said yes (lied to us when we saw them make the drink with house liquor). 
* At the Italian restaurant we asked what ‚Äúpremium‚Äù wine they had for The Level. We ordered and when they poured our wine, a couple of times I caught the name on the bottles and looked it up. They were $12 bottles of wine. 
* We still have not received The Level tote bags. We‚Äôve seen other people walking around with them. ‚Ä¶Once we got our appropriate wrist bands they set us up with a concierge who has been nice and somewhat helpful (got us the bed to use as a couch, can make dinner reservations for us, still haven‚Äôt got the tote bags yet though. 
* Plumbing issues - the temporary room we were in had a blocked sink. We left it overnight since it was late. When we told them in the morning, they were able to get someone to fix it within the hour. Then as we were leaving that room to check into our other room, there was no water coming out of the faucets. 
* Toilets don‚Äôt flush well and the flusher needs to be held down longer to fully flush, or needs to be flushed several times. 
* The showers are not luxurious. They are large but have old, non adjustable, small shower heads. No rainfall shower or shower head attachments. 

We still have 5 days left so hopefully things get smoother the longer we stay. This is not a huge establishment, it‚Äôs very intimate and generally quiet/chill/relaxing (not super lively except for the evening entertainment). If you want more variety when it comes to restaurants, this place is not it. Especially because one of the two menu based restaurants is randomly closed. 

If you want to ask for something and get it, this is not the place since they are still working through kinks. 

If you want what you expect from the website, this is not the place right now. 

If you want a place with a spa and gym, they do not have those here. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúnot ready yet‚Äù. It‚Äôs that they just do not have a spa and gym here and won‚Äôt have those at all. Pretty strange for a 4 star all inclusive. 

If you generally want to relax by the pool and beach in an intimate, relaxing environment, this place is nice enough. There are quite a lot of kids around (across age groups) but you honestly don‚Äôt really notice them. No screaming or crying, very well behaved kids but they all seem to be having fun. 

Overall, with all the amazing and beautiful all-inclusive‚Äôs in Cancun, and elsewhere, I would not come back here.",3,1734979599.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,0.72,False

Is there a secret phrase or a polite gesture that a customer can give, indicating they're really not ready for a best friend today, or should I know better when I pull up?

I'm not mean and I usually engage in whatever convo I'm forced into, but it seems like it's a bit forced and extra sometimes.

I also appreciate the vibe when compared to the more sterile places like Starbucks where everyone seems to hate being alive.

So is there like a nice goldilocks route to a room temp convo?

For what it's worth, it happens almost exclusively with men (I'm a dude). The last one was physically bouncing up and down while telling me how stoked he is for snow this year.

while we played hide and seek in the dark. 

My shin hit the coffee table 

and I can still feel the pain pressed fresh against my skin.

\_

Games of suspense and surprise 

are thought to be child's play. 

Bruises fade but my flesh holds memories 

of the wear and tear of my youth. 

\_

The routine of my girlhood

was a merry-go-round of misery. 

There seemed no way off

the tradition of the only temperament we knew. 

\_

I leapt off the route 

of my preconceived futurity. 

Feet first and reconsideration second,

I left my stomach on the ledge. 

\_

I arrived to womanhood

bursting with vast, barren scapes. 

I had no idea how to fill these years

with the joy I yearned. 

\_

From flint to fire he ignited my heart

when I had stopped hunting the happiness. 

He seeps into the crevasses within me

and seamlessly makes me whole. 

\_

I find fulfillment within my purpose

 that I stumbled on among my ruins. 

My narrative demonstrates hope

and my passion is to change their story too. 

\_

My future holds promise

and love radiates bright. 

Hide and seek is actually pretty easy--

you just need to turn on the lights.

We met online, but what was supposed to be a 45-60 minute coffee date turned into a 14 hour marathon date because we hit it off so well and clicked immediately.  


We knew our kids would get along.  I have one son who is 17.  She has four kids (20f, 18m, 16f, and 15m).  We especially expected my 17 yo son and her 16 yo daughter to get along because they share tastes in music and both play guitar.  

Little did we know just how well these two would hit it off.  They are now inseparable and even do things like share food and drinks as if they‚Äôre in a relationship.  

So here‚Äôs the question.  They are not related, and they didn‚Äôt grow up together.  Should we discourage any romance or let things run their course?  ",10,1734979117.0,family,25,0.81,False

I'll try keep this short and sweet, unlike me. I'm your typical British tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a serious friendship with someone who I click with and we just get it. Someone who has the time and effort to invest in creating a lasting bond, who I can be my silly self around without worry about being judged.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

So for diet: A lot of fiber makes it worse (my limit is like maybe 18g a day) and steroids make it better. Water doesn't seem to help.

I came to Paris on a trip with my girlfriend and to surprise me she booked a reservation at the caf√©. We had quite a wide variety of drinks, two espressos, two milk drinks and one pour over. We started with the ""coffee of the day"", as an introduction. I got an espresso and my girlfriend a flat white. The espresso was quite acidic and had a really unique taste profile, which I personally liked a lot. The flat white was less acidic, because of the milk but still kept that unique taste. Next was a gesha from Panama, but this time as a pour over. It was very fruity and tea like. It reminded me of the time I went to glitch in Ginza and tried their pour over, the one from substance was of similar quality in my opinion. After that was another espresso with again gesha but this time from Ethiopia, the gesha village 102. This was also very nice, had less acidity but nearly no bitterness as well, the flavour profile was a very clean and a bit Jasmin like. This was probably my favorite. Last but certainly was the freeze distillation macchiato, which was very sweet without added sugar and a milk drink with a very unique taste. I also bought the beans in the last picture to try at home, because I liked the other ones from gesha village so much. All in all it was the best coffee experience I had. It is definitely a must go for any coffee lover in Paris and even worth a visit for people who don't like coffee that much  (like my girlfriend) because it there is nearly no bitterness to the coffee. The best part, which personally made it better than glitch in my opinion is the barista. He was so nice, explaining everything, asking nicely about own methods and giving advice about the airport, because we went directly after the tasting, and of course about coffee as well. It is reservation only though and so should be booked in advance. Also it was a bit pricey at 58‚Ç¨ plus 29‚Ç¨ for the beans, which is only 100g, but in my opinion it was definitely worth it. I hope my English isn't too bad, it is not my native language. I also hope there aren't too many other people who post on here about the caf√©, like for glitch, but I think I only saw one and I can share something new to some people.

He was interested in the snacks, so I showed him my Chomps meat sticks, dark chocolate, and nuts. He immediately said ""Oh don't eat that crap!"" regarding the Chomps, which are actually a really healthy alternative to most jerkies. I remember feeling really turned off and uncomfortable with this part of the conversation, but the rest of the date went really well. 

We agreed to go out again but I keep thinking about what he said. I sent him info on the Chomps to see how he'd react, and while he agreed they seemed healthier than most jerky he still found fault with the sodium content. I then asked him casually how he approaches food choices with a partner, since he's also really into health and fitness (as am I, though not as intensely as he is).

He went off on a long, loud tirade about how I'm messy, he never has anywhere else to put his books, he hates how I don't keep up with housework or have a job, I'm ""always home 24/7"" (not true I do A LOT outside of the home including the grocery shopping and other household shopping, transporting my parents to their medical appointments, attending my own medical appointments, going out to coffee with friends, etc), if I cleaned and had a job this wouldn't be an issue, and then reached for the D word. (We've had an argument probably once a month for a few years now where he resorts to the D word but never does.) 

I am already too depressed to function and I don't understand how my simple request was hit with such a violent explosion. 

He doesn't treat me like I have several severe illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, as well as Lupus.

That being said, i matched on tinder with a 28 old man and he was looking for something serious so we were talking and it was all fine until i've told him about my lack of relationship experience because i wanted to be honest. He's got 3 relationships under his belt but somehow this info made him feel ""confused"" (his words) and he started talking about the future saying ""if i move abroad i would have to leave my serious girlfriend"" and he said ""he doesn't know if it's the right idea since it would be my first relationship"", leading him to be unsure if to meet up for a coffee. Maybe i am wrong but it feels like he panicked and wasnt thinking straight. After a while tho, he changed idea about meeting me for a coffee and said he was curious to meet me and was open to give it a try which i had agreed on but now i am unsure if it's worth it since i took his initial words seriously. What advice would you give me in this situation? Also sorry for sounding naive.",1,1734977945.0,dating_advice,2,0.99,False

Every month he texts me to talk about irrelevant things (I never initiate) and yesterday he wanted to meet up to return some stuff I had left at his place before the break up, eventhough I insisted that I didn't want them back and that he could donate them o throw them away. We had a coffee and talked, again, about irrelevant shit. He talk and talk and talk... About all the cool things he's been doing and when we said goodbye he wanted to give me a goodbye hug. And that's all.
I left him because I realized he was interested in his new female friends, meeting them one to one at his place, texting them a lot, meeting them without let me know, etc (he never admited It). I actually think he is dating one of them or at least I know that they've got very closed.

What do you think he wants to get from all of this? Closure? An ego boost? A second dish? Is he a Saint who only wants my friendship? ",2,1734977943.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I want to launch a little coffee/tea cart business and am looking for an espresso machine I can easily use on my cart. I have already done some research on multiple espresso machines for my little coffee cart business that I want to start, but I am trying to make a logical decision based on budget. ( l attached a picture of how the cart would look). I want a machine that obviously has cafe like quality output, my initial thought was to use the La Marzocco Linea Micra.
But if there are other machines that you could recommend instead my ears are open.

I'm a 17 year old male in junior year of high school and every night I struggle to sleep knowing I'll wake up in the same environment the next day. I was always a sad emotional kid even when I was really little. My sadness worsened when I came home from preschool, kindergarten or some other young schooling year (I don't remember) to my mom crying because my father got arrested. Fortunately, he was only arrested for a few months as it was only a drug charge.

Both my parents are (likely) mentally ill. My mother complains a lot and is always giving herself a hard time all the while she does most/all of the work around the house. I would be a liar if I said I helped all that often and I honestly feel guilty for not doing more. She used to talk about non stop wanting to sleep all day and I feel really horrible for her unlike my father.

I know that is bad to say when I just said he is (likely) mentally ill and he is my father after all but the thing about him is that he does non of the work around the house; instead, anytime he isn't at work he is either at his dad's house, napping, watching TV and/or snacking on food. He is also very angry all the time, especially towards my little brother. I believe he loves me more than my little brother as he doesn't really act angry towards me unlike him. That personally really grosses me out and makes me like him less.

In my freshman year of high school, I was extremely sad and stressed all the time for whatever reason. I did what I thought was most reasonable at the time to ease my pain and did what I now have as my biggest regret in life (cutting myself). I luckily never got addicted to it unlike some who do (if that's you please find some sort of support personal/system).

I've always hated living in the house I live in currently, with my shower's wall being very dirty and the ceiling of the bathroom being invested with black mold. The first or second day here my mother found a dead rat in the bathtub. My fridge non stop is making a really loud, almost luminescent noise like lights do in some gas stations. I've always been a kind of cleanliness freak in the weirdest of ways, with me not wanting to get my toys dirty while also never picking them up until I was told to.

I think around that time that the biggest problem my family is still suffering with now is the infestation of cockroaches in our downstairs area. I dread waking up everyday knowing how disgusting my environment is. Every night when I shower and brush my teeth there is almost always a couple on the ground.

Anytime I am in the kitchen getting myself coffee or refilling my cup with water in the morning there are usually not cockroaches but instead these really little bugs. One night after showering off a long day at work, I went to the living room to refill my cup of water and brush my hair and stuff before bed when I found my empty cup invested with bugs. I threw my cup of the ground and had a bit of a tantrum.

I have never gotten a girlfriend, I have never invited friends over, etc. because I don't want them to see that and see less of me. People will say ""Oh if they really cared about you they wouldn't care"" but you are most definitely wrong about that. It is a reflection on me as much as I don't want it to be and I would prefer to keep it a secret just in case I am right.

Friday while I was doing final's and after school when my mom took me to Walmart I was dreading the fact that I would be home for significantly more time than I usually am with school being out for winter break. It's not because I like school (I hate every second I'm not with friends), it's because of the bugs.

Today I woke up in a good mood, did my regular morning routine and after doing so got me a bowl of puppy chow. I ate a couple of little finger fulls when I noticed a small piece moving around. I studied that piece hoping it wasn't a cockroach and of course it was. Threw out the thing, texted my mom and now we are here. I'm making a post on a website I don't use, listening to music while my sister is probably listening to me crying because my day is already ruined at only 11 (now 12) am. I have no escape from this nightmare.

I only have to suffer with this for another year if I'm lucky with college and seeing if I can rent a hotel with friends. The worst part is that I have a little brother who is 7 years old who will likely have to deal with this until either my parents can afford to rent a new home or until he moves out, which won't be for bare minimum another 11 years.",1,1734977658.0,offmychest,8,0.67,False
